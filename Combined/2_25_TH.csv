0,2020/02/25,"Indian boxers in Italy offered early flight out due to COVID-19, but to stay put as ‘threat far away’","The Indian team, comprising 13 boxers and about the same number of support staff, is currently in Assisi, a hill town in the central Italian region of Umbria

Indian boxers training in Italy for next month’s Olympic qualifiers were given the option of flying out early due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) threat in the country, but the team has decided to stay put as its training base in Assisi is “far” from the epicentre of the outbreak.

The Indian team, comprising 13 boxers and about the same number of support staff, is currently in Assisi, a hill town in the central Italian region of Umbria. The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy has so far affected the northern Lombardy region, leaving seven dead and 229 infected.

“We are staying put in Assisi, we have a scheduled training tomorrow. We were a bit worried when we heard news of the outbreak. But as we understand now, the outbreak is quite far, near Milan, while we are in the central region,” India’s High Performance Director Santiago Nieva told PTI from Assisi.

“We have spoken to the Italian authorities and realised that there is no need for concern for us right now. Please do not spread unnecessary panic, there is no early fly out happening. We will depart as scheduled on Friday,” he asserted.

The Olympic qualifiers for boxing are scheduled to be held in Jordan from March 3. The event was postponed by a month after the original host — Wuhan in China — went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Indian team, comprising decorated stars such as the legendary M.C. Mary Kom, Amit Panghal and Vikas Krishan among others, is scheduled to leave for Jordan from Rome on Friday.

Eleven Italian towns — 10 in Lombardy and one in the north-eastern region of Veneto — have been placed under a lockdown, according to various media reports.

The team was given the choice of leaving as early as Wednesday after Nieva expressed concerns in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak in his communication with the national federation.

“Yes, the federation had given us the option of taking an early flight to Jordan, but we are okay with staying back and completing our camp as planned because we are far away from the threat,” Nieva said.

“There is no need to panic, my message to the federation was meant to sensitise them of the situation and explore options should the situation arise,” he added, when asked about his message to the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) Secretary General Jay Kowli.

The event in Jordan will kick-start the qualifying process for the Tokyo Olympics this year.

“Our training is going quite well. Everything is as per plan and we are confident of a strong showing in the qualifiers,” Nieva said.

The women’s team of five boxers has been training in Assisi since February 18, while the eight-strong men’s squad joined in on February 23.

Boxing’s Olympic qualifiers as well as the main event in Tokyo is being conducted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

The decision was taken after the IOC suspended the International Boxing Association (AIBA), owing to alleged financial and administrative mismanagement.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/indian-boxers-in-italy-offered-early-flight-out-due-to-covid-19-but-to-stay-put-as-threat-far-away/article30913285.ece

5,2020/02/25,"Experience counts in Grand Slams, says Pierce","‘Playing on clay helps youngsters develop physically, mentally, technically, tactically’

Mary Pierce was able to play her best tennis in Grand Slams early in her career, but emphasised that playing one’s best tennis in Grand Slams, was achieved mainly through experience.

“To feel at home in Grand Slams, you need the experience. You keep getting better each time. Everyone feels nervous the first time.

“To play your best in competition, you need the experience, the hard work and the ability to stay focused,’’ said Pierce, who interacted with the junior players and the media, during the Roland Garros junior wild card tennis event at the DLTA Complex on Tuesday.

Expressing happiness about being part of the promotion for clay court tennis, and Roland Garros, “the Mecca of clay court tennis’’, Pierce said she could not believe that it was already 20 years since she won the Roland Garros.

“When I won the first match on the centre court, it was an incredible experience. It was my first win on centre court.

“ I had a special feeling inside of me. I told myself, this could be the year for me. I didn’t tell that to anyone. I kept winning match by match, reached the final and my belief came true’’, recalled Pierce, who had to wait for six years to win Roland Garros, after having lost the final to Arantxa Sanchez in Paris in 1994, when she was 19.

Pierce said playing on clay developed the young players, “physically, mentally, technically and tactically.’’

Inspiring

She also observed that the juniors will be inspired and motivated while competing in the same tournament as the top stars of the game, and would learn a lot especially by watching the professionals practice.

Conceding that the game needed to be affordable to ensure the wide participation of people from different economic backgrounds, Pierce said she was lucky to have had a sponsor from the age of 13.

“We had a sponsor for three years when I was 13. We could live and eat. Train and travel for tournaments. I don’t think I could have made it without that support’’, said Pierce.

She also pointed out that once the players took care of the equipment and court, they could develop by playing even against the wall, as having coaches would require paying for them.

“Playing against the wall is really important. It has been lost with time’’, she remarked.

Noting that Abhimanyu Vannem Reddy had made it to the Roland Garros event in 2017 through the wild card series, Pierce wished that the current lot would work hard to emulate such an achievement.

“I have been to India a few times, and I know that there is talent in abundance in the country,’’ she said.

She highlighted the impact of players like Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi, Rohan Bopanna and Sania Mirza on world tennis, and expressed her belief that Indian players could make a mark in singles on the Grand Slam stage.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/by77c4/article30916143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26Mary,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/experience-counts-in-grand-slams-says-pierce/article30916144.ece
6,2020/02/25,Swarm robots can help control self driving cars,"The researchers at Northwestern University in the US, tested the algorithm in a simulation of 1,024 robots and on a swarm of 100 real robots in the laboratory.

To help make self-driving vehicles safer and more flawless, the researchers have developed a decentralised algorithm with a collision-free, deadlock-free guarantee.

The researchers at Northwestern University in the US, tested the algorithm in a simulation of 1,024 robots and on a swarm of 100 real robots in the laboratory.

The robots reliably, safely and efficiently converged to form a pre-determined shape in less than a minute, according to the study, scheduled to be published in the journal IEEE Transactions on Robotics later this month.

“By understanding how to control our swarm robots to form shapes, we can understand how to control fleets of autonomous vehicles as they interact with each other,” said study lead author Michael Rubenstein from Northwestern University.

A decentralised approach

The advantage of a swarm of small robots -- versus one large robot or a swarm with one lead robot -- is the lack of a centralised control, which can quickly become a central point of failure. Rubenstein’s decentralised algorithm acts as a fail-safe.

“If the system is centralised and a robot stops working, then the entire system fails,” Rubenstein said.

“In a decentralised system, there is no leader telling all the other robots what to do. Each robot makes its own decisions. If one robot fails in a swarm, the swarm can still accomplish the task,” Rubenstein added.

Also Read Self-driving cars learn to navigate the unknown

According to the researcher, still, the robots need to coordinate in order to avoid collisions and deadlock.

To do this, the algorithm views the ground beneath the robots as a grid. By using technology similar to GPS, each robot is aware of where it sits on the grid.

Near-sighted coordination

Before making a decision about where to move, each robot uses sensors to communicate with its neighbours, determining whether or not nearby spaces within the grid are vacant or occupied.

“The robots refuse to move to a spot until that spot is free and until they know that no other robots are moving to that same spot, they are careful and reserve a space ahead of time,” Rubenstein added.

Even with all this careful coordination, the robots are still able to communicate and move swiftly to form a shape.

The researchers accomplished this by keeping the robots near-sighted.

“Each robot can only sense three or four of its closest neighbors,” Rubenstein explained.

“They can’t see across the whole swarm, which makes it easier to scale the system. The robots interact locally to make decisions without global information,” Rubenstein said.

In Rubenstein’s swarm, for example, 100 robots can coordinate to form a shape within a minute. In some previous approaches, it could take a full hour.

The algorithm could be used in fleets of driverless cars and in automated warehouses, the study said.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/vfrhbu/article23522459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13INTHROHDRIVERLESSCARS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/swarm-robots-can-help-control-self-driving-cars/article30912710.ece

9,2020/02/25,Xiaomi to bring ISRO technology NavIC to smartphones in 2020,"NavIC is the regional geo-positioning system to provide accurate positioning in India and 1,500 km around the Indian mainland

Smartphone and smart TV brand Xiaomi on Tuesday announced it would bring ISRO’s Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System NavIC technology to its smartphones.

Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) is the regional geo-positioning system designed in the country by the Bengaluru-headquartered Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to provide accurate positioning in India and 1,500 km around the Indian mainland.

The capability has been currently enabled by Qualcomm Technologies Inc on several of their Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile Platforms and will be made available across multiple Xiaomi smartphones in India, Xiaomi said in a statement.

In 2020, several Xiaomi smartphones across multiple price points will support NavIC initially supported by some Snapdragon chipsets.

The implementation was possible after R&D efforts from Xiaomi for software along with ISRO’s (Indian Space Research Organisation) and Qualcomms efforts, it said.

“Xiaomi has taken this step to further extend its commitment to Make in India, by bringing in technology developed in India within its smartphones”, the company said.

“This is the first time a leading smartphone brand has worked with ISRO to bring technology developed within the country to the forefront”, it said.

NavIC comprises seven satellites, three of which are in geostationary orbit over the Indian Ocean and four in geosynchronous orbit and is capable of providing location positioning accuracy better than 20 metres.

Some of the key consumer applications of NavIC for mobile include precise location mapping in remote, difficult to access areas, precise timing, along with visual and voice navigation for drivers among others.

Commenting on the co-operation, ISRO Chairman Dr. K.Sivan, said NavIC is a critical step forward in the pursuit of harnessing space technology for national development and ISRO is eager to make it accessible to everyone for everyday use.

He expressed happiness that Xiaomi India has enabled this technology across several devices in their 2020 portfolio.

Sivan said ISRO looks forward to extending the benefits of this indigenous solution to millions of Indians through such initiatives.

He also appreciated Qualcomm Technologies for enabling NavIC support on their mobile chipset platforms.

11,2020/02/25,The ‘sharent’ trap : How parents can be the biggest violators of their children’s digital privacy,"The new trend of ‘first-person sharenting’ often trigger larger debates, touching on darker themes of over-exposure, exploitation and identity crises

When Delhi-based Kavita Kataria, a budding mommy-blogger of GoodThingsGrow, recalls the moment she decided to create a dedicated Instagram account for her then-one year-old daughter Myrah, she explains, “I decided to make one on her first birthday. When she turned one, everyone called to wish but were complaining that they haven’t met her yet, saying that I should share more pictures and videos of her. So I thought, why not make an account for her and add friends and family?”

To help save data on her smartphone, the account became a means to keep record of her child’s journey as she grew up. “This way, not only will everyone see her life journey, but we will be able to see her grow on a single platform. It was a private account at first. Then, a few kids accounts contacted us to ask if they could feature her cute pictures on their page, so we made it public.”

Know your policy While actually posting to social media is a freedom of expression, the usage of a child’s data can be stonewalled to an extent. In India, the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 still requires an effective gating system. The PDP Bill considers any person below the age of 18 a child, in line with Indian laws on the age of majority. And with ‘sharenting’ there is a clear loophole when the data is posted by an adult.

still requires an effective gating system. The PDP Bill considers any person below the age of 18 a child, in line with Indian laws on the age of majority. And with ‘sharenting’ there is a clear loophole when the data is posted by an adult. For reference, we can look at the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which affords some protection of children in the information industry, which introduces the so-called “right to erasure” or “right to be forgotten”. In January 2020, the UK ICO published an Age Appropriate Design Code, which is a set of 15 standards that online services should meet to protect children’s privacy.

But soon the account was pulled down and, in a panic, the young parent took to Facebook and asked her friends why this happened and if she could recover the account. There are no official statistics stating the number for this somewhat new breed of public parent-run social media accounts or ‘sharenting’ — where posts have a first-person narrative of the child.

Situations like this often trigger larger debates, touching on darker themes of over-exposure, exploitation and identity crises, citing parents to be the biggest violators of their children’s privacy. Age restriction is one aspect, but it is worth considering the actual choice of digital citizenship, and that children should be informed detailedly of what being on the Internet entails.

Power of choice

While it is quickly assumed that most children today are online natives, should they not decide for themselves if they have an online presence or an account? Kavita responds, “[If Myrah does not want an account], we will happily remove it. I am making this to treasure best memories of her for her, because, she will never have time to go through the tens of thousands of videos and pictures we take of her. But if she has any issues, then we will delete it.” Complications do arise as the child grows older, especially when consent has not been given.

Tara Bedi, Public Policy and Community Outreach Manager at Instagram, explains that the Facebook-owned platform is quite strict, and is quick to shut down accounts which do not comply with their Community Guidelines. “[Like TikTok, Facebook and YouTube], we require everyone on Instagram to be at least 13 years old before they can create an account. If someone sees an account that they think is run by someone under 13, they can report it to us. We will disable accounts we find that are run by people under 13 years old. We do allow parents or representatives, for example managers, to have an account representing someone who is under 13 as long as it is clear in the bio information that the account is run by the parent or representative.”

Turn to resources

There is a large amount of information available to parents, but these resources are not discussed as frequently as they should, given the rapidly changing digital space. Tara agrees, “This is why [Instagram] created a resource centre for parents, where they can access a host of resources, including a Parents Guide. We also [have] an Indian version of the guide in partnership with the Cyber Peace Foundation, Delhi, and ‘It’s Ok To Talk’, a mental health organisation, to support parents, as they help their children build healthy online habits, talk about powerful tools within Instagram that can help them filter bad comments and manage how much time they spend on the platform.”

A March 2016 study ‘When the Child is Born into the Internet: Sharenting as a Growing Trend among Parents on Facebook’ by Anna Brosch explains, “The most popular type of embarrassing pictures of children shows them nude or semi-nude. Of the 113 accounts [surveyed], 77.9% of the parents posted 411 photos of this kind. Admittedly, they were usually taken during bath or on the beach and basically concern children under three years of age, but even then they should not be exposed to public viewing.” Then there is the fear of that data getting into the wrong hands.

This does not apply to just Instagram; TikTok, YouTube and Facebook pages are densely populated with parent-run child accounts who also monetise on their content. Popular child accounts include the bank-breaking toy-reviewing Ryan’s World on YouTube and twin sisters Mila and Emma on Instagram. TikTok has numerous resources for parents, guiding them through privacy, commenting restrictions, restricting duets and digital well-being. YouTube and Google often hold offline discussion seminars about newer policies, as children’s safety became a priority for the platform last year.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/s3g9h7/article30911015.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/wirelesslead,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/sharenting-or-the-sharent-trap-childrens-online-digital-privacy-internet-social-media/article30911018.ece

The U.S.-China trade and technology war is the clearest manifestation of the change, and the sense in Delhi is this widening rift is neither a Trump phenomenon nor transient. The new U.S. approach to China is bipartisan and likely here to stay regardless of the outcome of November’s elections. In fact, Trump is being seen as far from the most hawkish voice on China in Washington, given his well-known proclivity for wanting to “cut a deal”.

Shared concerns about China’s rise are not new, and have underpinned India’s relations with the United States going back to the 1950s. These concerns provided the backdrop for the landmark nuclear deal finalised during George W. Bush’s 2006 visit, as well as for the joint strategic vision unveiled during Barack Obama’s visit in 2015.

But “the dynamic has now changed in a fundamental way”, said former Indian Ambassador to China Ashok Kantha. In 2005, the U.S. and China were largely cooperative despite differences. Now, the U.S. is clearly looking at China as a strategic “competitor” and “revisionist power”, as a 2017 national security strategy put it.

This offered opportunities and challenges for India, which has carefully expanded ties with America while reluctant to upset China — a neighbour with which it shares an unresolved border. “Calibration becomes tougher as we are under greater pressure from both,” said Mr. Kantha. “My own view is the situation creates openings which we should take advantage of, rather than only think of balance.”

One such opening is the Quad Initiative with the U.S., Australia and Japan, which Mr. Trump said on Tuesday he and Prime Minister Modi were “revitalising” including through expanded cooperation on maritime security “to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific”.

On Tuesday, both countries inked a $2.6-billion defence deal for 24 MH-60 Seahawk helicopters, another indicator of growing defence ties, which have seen a logistics exchange agreement in 2016 to provide mutual access to designated military facilities and a communications compatibility agreement in 2018 to enable greater interoperability and sales of high-end technology.

“It’s no secret that Chinese submarines and warships have begun regular operations in the Indian Ocean over the past decade and this arguably provided some of the impetus behind greater joint efforts on maritime domain awareness, intelligence sharing, and naval exercises including the first-ever tri-service military exercise last December,” said Jeff Smith, South Asia scholar at the Heritage Foundation, stressing that “shared concerns about China are defensive in nature, rather than intended to produce an offensive, containment-style strategy”.

Mr. Kantha said India should do more with the Quad, starting with including Australia in the trilateral naval Exercise Malabar with the U.S. and Japan and working more closely in humanitarian and disaster relief and protecting sealines of communication. “Working on such initiatives does not mean we are looking to contain China and will in no way undermine India’s strategic autonomy,” he said, adding that India had no reason to be overly sensitive to China’s concerns, noting how China considered Indian sensitivities in its ties with Pakistan.

Mr. Trump on Tuesday highlighted regional connectivity and the Blue Dot Network pushed by the U.S., Australia and Japan to promote private sector-led, sustainable and ‘trustworthy’ options for infrastructure — a veiled criticism of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Mr. Modi said India agreed with the U.S. on the importance of sustainable and transparent financing in the development of connectivity infrastructure across the world.

Hurdles, however, remain. As a January 28 study by the Centre for New American Security in Washington put it, the U.S. effort in the region remained “inconsistent, uncoordinated and under-resourced”. Convergence may be growing, but walking the talk is still a challenge.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/552f8j/article30915552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/analysis-widening-us-china-rift-fuels-trumps-modi-outreach/article30915553.ece
14,2020/02/25,"Virus infections cross 80,000 globally","South Korea has reported the most COVID-19 cases outside China, with 977 infections and 10 deaths

Iran’s COVID-19 death toll rose to 16 on Tuesday, the highest outside China, increasing its international isolation as dozens of countries from South Korea to Italy accelerated emergency measures to curb the epidemic’s global spread.

Believed to come from wildlife in Wuhan city late last year, the flu-like disease has infected 80,000 people and killed 2,663 in China. But the World Health Organization (WHO) says the epidemic there has peaked and has been declining since February 2.

Beyond mainland China, however, it has jumped to about 29 countries and territories, with some three dozen deaths, according to a Reuters tally. Growing outbreaks in Iran, Italy and South Korea are of particular concern.

“We are close to a pandemic but there is still hope,” said Raina MacIntyre, head of a biosecurity programme at the University of New South Wales.

Iran faces isolation

Iran’s outbreak, amid mounting U.S. sanctions pressure, threatens to leave it further cut off. Several countries suspended flights due to cases in travellers from Iran to Canada, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq.

Some neighbours also closed borders, while Oman’s Khasab port halted imports and exports with Iran.

“It is an uninvited and inauspicious visitor. God willing we will get through... this virus,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech.

Iran cancelled concerts and soccer matches nationwide, and schools and universities closed in many provinces. Many Iranians took to social media to accuse authorities of concealing facts.

Authorities say U.S. sanctions are hampering its response to the coronavirus by preventing imports of masks and medicines.

South Korea has the most virus cases outside China, with 977 infections and 10 deaths, the majority linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the city of Daegu, where the outbreak is believed to have begun with a 61-year-old woman.

Church under scrutiny

Authorities were to test all members of the church, estimated by media at about 215,000 people. President Moon Jae-in acknowledged the situation was “very grave”.

In Europe, Italy is the front line, with more than 280 cases and seven deaths, most in the northern Lombardy and Veneto regions but one case emerging in Sicily, the first in the country south of Rome.

A planned three-week shoot in Italy for Tom Cruise’s seventh outing in the Mission: Impossible series was also postponed, while Milan cathedral was closed and Venice carnival cancelled.

Airlines began restricting flights to Italy, while prices for masks and gels skyrocketed.

Croatia, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman reported their first new coronavirus cases, all in people who had been to Iran.

With dozens of sporting events already hit, Japan, which has had four deaths and 850 cases, said it was premature to talk about cancelling the Tokyo Olympics due to start on July 24.

The U.S. pledged $2.5 billion to fight the disease, with more than $1 billion going towards developing a vaccine.

With the pace of new infections slowing, Beijing said restrictions on travel should begin to be lifted.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bhuzoo/article30915476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Italy-Milan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/virus-infections-cross-80000-globally/article30915478.ece
15,2020/02/25,UAE bans Iran flights over COVID-19; at least 15 dead in Iran,"The UAE, home to long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad, remains a key international transit route for Iran’s 80 million people

The United Arab Emirates on Tuesday banned all flights to and from Iran over the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), just a day after its spread from the Islamic Republic was announced across multiple Mideast nations. Iran meanwhile raised the official death toll from the virus to 15 killed amid 95 confirmed infections.

The UAE, home to long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad, remains a key international transit route for Iran’s 80 million people. The flight ban, which will last at least a week, shows the growing concern over the spread of the virus in Iran amid worries the outbreak may be larger than what authorities there now acknowledge.

The Emirates’ General Civil Aviation Authority made the announcement via the country’s state-run WAM news agency, just hours after Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel, said there would be restrictions on flights there.

Explained | When can people transmit the novel coronavirus?

“All passenger and cargo aircraft travelling to and from Iran will be suspended for a period of one week, and could be up for extension,” the authority said. “The decision is a precautionary measure undertaken by the UAE to ensure strict monitoring and prevention of the spread of the COVID-19.”

Emirates, the government-owned carrier based in Dubai, flies daily to Tehran. Its low-cost sister airline, FlyDubai, flies to multiple Iranian cities, as does the Sharjah-based low-cost carrier Air Arabia.

The announcement came after Bahrain said it would suspend all flights from Dubai and Sharjah, a neighbouring UAE emirate that is home to Air Arabia, for 48 hours.

Epidemic vs. pandemic? Glossary of terms for virus outbreak

Bahrain’s Health Ministry on Tuesday raised the number of infected cases from the new virus to eight, saying that all had travelled from Iran via Dubai. Four of them have been identified as Saudi nationals. The cases were confirmed upon arrival to Bahrain during screenings at the airport, and prior to the suspension on flights to Dubai and Sharjah, according to Bahrain’s official news agency.

Dubai has been screening passengers on incoming flights from China, where the outbreak began in December. Long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad are among the few international airlines still flying to Beijing. However, the outbreak in Iran only became public in recent days.

The novel coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people globally, causing around 2,700 deaths, mainly in China. The World Health Organization has named the illness COVID-19, referring to its origin late last year and the coronavirus that causes it.

Iran’s government said Tuesday that 15 people had died nationwide from COVID-19, rejecting claims of a much higher death toll of 50 by a lawmaker from the city of Qom that has been at the epicentre of the virus in the country. The conflicting reports raised questions about the Iranian government’s transparency concerning the scale of the outbreak.

The new death toll came from Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour during an interview with Iranian state television. He said there were 95 confirmed cases of the virus in Iran, with many linked to Qom, a major Shiite religious centre where other cases have emerged.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani sought to reassure the nation in a speech on Tuesday, calling COVID-19 an “uninvited and inauspicious passenger.”

“We will get through corona,” Mr. Rouhani said. “We will get through the virus.”

Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq and Oman also announced their first cases of the virus on Monday and connected them to travel with Iran.

The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, has reported 13 cases of the new virus. Most of those were connected to Chinese travel.

Also Tuesday, Kuwait raised the number of its infected cases to eight, according to the state-run KUNA news agency, after earlier raising the number to five. It said the three latest cases involved Kuwaiti citizens just back from Iran, without giving more details. The five previously reported cases were passengers returning on a flight from the Iranian city of Mashhad, where Iran’s government has not yet announced a single case of the virus.

Kuwait had halted transport links with Iran over the weekend and said it was evacuating its citizens from Iran.

Meanwhile, Iraq’s Health Ministry said four new cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed in the northern province of Kirkuk. It said the afflicted were members of an Iraqi family who had returned from a recent trip to Iran. Iraq announced the discovery of the first COVID-19 case in the country on Monday in the Shiite Muslim holy city of Najaf.

Iraq had earlier closed its border with Iran to Iranian nationals but apparently Iraqis can still cross the boundary.

Also Tuesday, a Turkish Airlines flight from Tehran to Istanbul landed in Ankara with 17 passengers suspected of having COVID-19, including some who had been to the Iranian city of Qom, Turkey’s CNN-Turk broadcaster reported. The passengers were to be quarantined at an Ankara hospital that had previously quarantined Turks returning from China’s Hubei province. Turkish Airlines has temporarily suspended most flights with Iran, apart from those with Tehran.

Turkey’s Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said the Turks on board were being repatriated due to the outbreak in Iran. All 132 passengers and crew on board would be quarantined for 14 days at the same hospital where Turkish citizens returning from China had been quarantined. “We are engaged in the maximum effort possible to protect our country from this ilness,” Mr. Koca said.

In Pakistan, about 100 pilgrims, mostly minority Pakistani Shiites, have been quarantined at a government building after returning from Iran, officials said Tuesday. The pilgrims had returned before Pakistan on Saturday closed its border with Iran at the crossing in the town of Taftan in southwestern Baluchistan province.

More than 7,000 Pakistani pilgrims remain still in Iran where health authorities will have to declare them free of COVID-19 before they can go home. Pakistan last week suspended flight operations with China, where thousands of Pakistanis have been stranded since the infectious spread there. Islamabad has no immediate plans to evacuate Pakistani citizens from China.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3w51bk/article30913607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THAPAPTOPIXIRANVIRUSOUTBREAKMIDEAST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uae-bans-iran-flights-over-covid-19-at-least-15-dead-in-iran/article30913608.ece
16,2020/02/25,"Hosni Mubarak, former Egypt President who was ousted in 2011 uprising, passes away","Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian leader who for nearly 30 years was the resolute face of stability in the Middle East, died on Tuesday, the country’s state television said, ending his days after a swift and ignominious tumble from power in the Arab world’s pro-democracy upheaval. He was 91.

Throughout his rule, he was a stalwart US ally, a bullwark against Islamic militancy and guardian of Egypt’s peace with Israel. But to the tens of thousands of young Egyptians who rallied for 18 days of unprecedented street protests in Cairo’s central Tahrir Square and elsewhere in 2011, Mr. Mubarak was a relic, a latter-day pharaoh.

They were inspired by the Tunisian revolt, and harnessed the power of social media to muster tumultuous throngs, unleashing popular anger over the graft and brutality that shadowed his rule. In the end, with millions massed in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and city centers around the country and even marching to the doorstep of Mr. Mubarak’s palace, the military that long nurtured him pushed him aside on February 11, 2011.

Hosni Mubarak, who rose to power after the assassination of his predecessor Anwar Sadat and then steered Egypt through the turmoil that swept the Arab world, has been sentenced to life in prison on charges of complicity in the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising.

Photo: AP In 2011, the fear that Hosni Mubarak was grooming his son, Gamal, a wealthy businessman, to succeed him left many Egyptians feeling trapped in the past, deprived of change and renewal. Then, the uprising in Tunisia delivered an electrifying message — an old order can be ousted. In the November 28, 2010 photo Mubarak's son, Gamal, prepares to vote at a polling station in Cairo. Photo: AP Hosni Mubarak initially responded to protests by saying he would not seek another term, and his government said his son, Gamal, would not run, either. But the President later rejected demands that he step down immediately, fuelling further protests. The January 25, 2011 photo shows anti-government protesters in Cairo. Photo: AP Hosni Mubarak’s persuasive argument for 29 years — that he feared the country would sink deeper into chaos without him — was overwhelmed by the cries of huge crowds in Cairo’s Tahrir Square: “Leave! Leave!”. The February 11, 2011 photo shows protesters at the Tahrir Square in Cairo.

The generals took power, hoping to preserve what they could of the system he headed.

Though Tunisia’s president fell before him, the ouster of Mr. Mubarak was the more stunning collapse in the face of the Arab Spring shaking regimes across the Arab world.

He became the only leader so far ousted in the protest wave to be imprisoned. He was convicted along with his former security chief on June 2012 and sentenced to life in prison for failing to prevent the killing of some 900 protesters during the 18-day who rose up against his autocratic regime in 2011. Both appealed the verdict and a higher court later cleared them in 2014.

Pakistan’s Punjab government on Tuesday decided not to extend the bail granted on medical grounds to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who is currently in London for treatment, according to media reports.

Punjab Law Minister Raja Basharat said the Punjab Cabinet decided that there was “no legal, moral or medical basis without any concrete proof” for the further extension of the bail to the 70-year-old leader.

Amid bickering between the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party and Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the three-time Prime Minister left for London for medical treatment on November 19, 2019.

On December 23, he sought an extension on his stay abroad on the expiry of the four-week period granted by the Lahore High Court. Following this, the Punjab government constituted a four-member committee to decide on it and sought fresh medical reports to make an “informed decision”.

Addressing a press conference alongside other members of the Punjab Cabinet, including provincial health minister Dr. Yasmin Rashid, Basharat said, “The committee has decided that Nawaz Sharif’s bail can’t be extended further.”

He explained that the Lahore High Court order said Sharif was granted bail for eight weeks. However, a further eight weeks had passed since then as discussions were underway, the minister said.

“Till the Punjab government had not made a decision, this bail was to be automatically extended, therefore it was extended for 16 weeks,” he said.

After the passage of 16 weeks, Basharat said the provincial government wanted to be informed about developments regarding Sharif’s health on the basis of which a decision to extend his bail could be made.

“Till today he (Nawaz) has not been admitted in any hospital in London,” Basharat said, adding that nothing specific had been shared with the government regarding the PML-N supremo’s health.

Basharat said the Punjab government would now share its decision with the federal government, which will decide on the matter.

In January, a picture of Sharif at a London restaurant along with some members of his family had surfaced on social media, raising questions about the condition of the former premier’s health.

Following this, on January 15, the Punjab government rejected Sharif’s medical reports which had been submitted on December 23.

Once again on January 30, the Punjab government asked Sharif to submit fresh medical reports so that a decision on his request seeking more time abroad could be made.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jgjg5r/article30913144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NAWAZSHARIF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistans-punjab-govt-not-to-extend-bail-granted-to-nawaz-sharif-for-treatment-abroad/article30913145.ece
18,2020/02/25,"South Korea ‘very grave’, says Moon Jae-in as COVID-19 cases approach 1,000","More than 80 % of the infections have been in South Korea’s fourth-largest city Daegu

COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea is “very grave”, President Moon Jae-in said Tuesday as he visited its epicentre and the country’s total number of cases approached 1,000.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) confirmed 144 new infections, taking the tally to 977, the largest national total anywhere outside China, where the virus first emerged.

Scores of events have been cancelled or postponed as the outbreak has spread in the world’s 12th-largest economy, from K-pop concerts to the start of the K-league football season, with casualties on Tuesday including parliamentary sessions and the World Team Table Tennis championships.

More than 80% of the infections have been in South Korea’s fourth-largest city Daegu and neighbouring North Gyeongsang province.

“The situation is very grave,” President Moon Jae-in said on a visit to Daegu, wearing the uniform of a government emergency official and vowing full government support.

“We will achieve a victory in the fight against this virus,” he added.

The streets of Daegu -- which has a population of 2.5 million — have been largely deserted for days, apart from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale.

Authorities urged the public to exercise extra caution, advising citizens to stay home if they have a fever or respiratory symptoms.

South Korea’s parliament cancelled sessions Tuesday as it closed for cleaning after confirmation a person with the COVID-19 had attended a meeting last week.

The country’s flag carrier Korean Air also reported a cabin crew member had tested positive, without giving details.

The staffer may have been infected by a group of South Korean pilgrims who flew to Israel, reports said, adding that the attendant subsequently flew from Incheon to Los Angeles and back last week.

And the U.S. hinted at scaling back joint military exercises, with Defense Secretary Mark Esper telling reporters in Washington the two allies’ militaries were “looking at scaling back the command post training due to concerns about the COVID-19”.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised travellers to “avoid all nonessential travel” to South Korea.

Hong Kong has said it will not allow arrivals from South Korea other than returning residents, while a Mongolian ban on flights to and from the South came into force Tuesday.

Organisers of the World Team Table Tennis championship, due to be held in Busan in March, said new dates in June had been “provisionally reserved“.

The Korean Basketball League said it would hold matches behind closed doors “until the situation improves“.

Three more people had died, the KCDC said, taking the toll to 10. But the case numbers it announced represented the smallest daily increase for four days.

South Korea has an advanced medical system, a free press and a strong culture of public accountability, and observers say that its health statistics can be treated with confidence.

Most of the country’s infections are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, an entity often accused of being a cult.

A 61-year-old female member developed a fever on February 10, but attended at least four church services in Daegu before being diagnosed.

KCDC director Jung Eun-kyeong advised Shincheonji followers to refrain from going outside “as much as possible“.

With public criticism growing, Shincheonji’s founder Lee Man-hee said the group would provide the government a list of all its members to have them tested for the virus.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a24svf/article30913103.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/G20-GERMANYSOUTHKOREA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-korea-very-grave-says-moon-jae-in-as-covid-19-cases-approach-1000/article30913104.ece
19,2020/02/25,U.S. Commission on Religious Freedom to hold hearing on citizenship laws next week,"‘Witnesses will discuss how citizenship laws are used to target religious minorities, particularly in Myanmar and India’, USCIRF said in a statement

A U.S. commission on international religious freedom will hold a hearing next week on how citizenship laws in countries like India and Myanmar are leveraged to deny the religious minorities legal protection, making them vulnerable to exploitation, discrimination and mass atrocities.

The announcement of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) came amidst the widespread protests in India against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the ongoing maiden official visit of U.S. President Donald Trump to India.

According to the CAA, members of the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 following religious persecution there will get Indian citizenship.

The Indian government has been emphasising that the new law will not deny citizenship rights, but has been brought to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries and give them citizenship.

The USCIRF hearing is scheduled for March 4.

“Witnesses will discuss how citizenship laws are used to target religious minorities, particularly in Burma (Myanmar) and India, and will highlight the importance of the atrocity prevention framework for understanding the potential consequences of these laws,” it said in a statement.

With widespread protests in recent months in India in response to the CAA and a proposed National Register of Citizens, however, citizenship laws as a tool to target religious minorities is receiving much needed international attention, the USCIRF said.

“This phenomenon has a long-standing precedent with such measures as the 1982 Citizenship Law in Burma stripping the Rohingya of their rights as citizens.

“Without citizenship rights, minority communities are left to face further persecution and violence by both governments and non-state actors. In particular, government efforts to strip religious minorities of their citizenship can be a key predictor of mass atrocities,” it said.

Several experts have been invited to testify at the hearing.

Tony Perkins, Chair, USCIRF; Gayle Manchin, Vice Chair, and Anurima Bhargava, its Commissioner would make opening remarks.

India maintains that the Indian Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to all its citizens, including its minority communities.

A senior official of the Ministry of External Affairs has said it is widely acknowledged that India is a vibrant democracy where the Constitution provides protection of religious freedom, and where democratic governance and rule of law further promote and protect fundamental rights.

Defending the CAA, Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month said that the law is not about taking away citizenship, it is about giving citizenship.

“We must all know that any person of any religion from any country of the world who believes in India and its Constitution can apply for Indian citizenship through due process. There’s no problem in that,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eqi3ig/article30912029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NOCAAFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-commission-on-religious-freedom-to-hold-hearing-on-citizenship-laws-next-week/article30912030.ece
20,2020/02/25,Thousands caught in floods in Indonesia’s sinking capital,"Overnight rains caused more rivers to burst their banks in greater Jakarta starting Sunday, sending muddy water up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) deep into more residential and commercial areas, said Agus Wibowo, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency’s spokesman.

Floods that have crippled much of Indonesia’s capital worsened Tuesday, inundating thousands of homes and buildings, including the presidential palace, and paralyzing transport networks, officials and witnesses said.

Overnight rains caused more rivers to burst their banks in greater Jakarta starting Sunday, sending muddy water up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) deep into more residential and commercial areas, said Agus Wibowo, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency’s spokesman.

Floodwaters entered parts of Indonesia’s presidential palace complex on Tuesday morning but the situation was brought under control with water pumps, said Bey Machmudin, an official at the Presidential Office.

The heavy downpour that hit the capital on Sunday had submerged the state-run Cipto Mangunkusumo hospital, the country’s largest hospital, damaging medical machines and equipment, Wibowo said.

Mr. Wibowo said the floods on Tuesday inundated scores of districts and left more than 300 people homeless, forced authorities to cut off electricity and paralyzed transportation, including commuter lines, as floodwaters reached as high as 1.5 meters (5 feet) in places.

Television footage showed soldiers and rescuers in rubber boats struggling to evacuate children and the elderly who were holding out on the roofs of their squalid houses.

Indonesia’s meteorological agency is predicting rain for the next two weeks.

The flooding has highlighted Indonesia’s infrastructure problems.

Jakarta is home to 10 million people, with a total of 30 million in its greater metropolitan area. It is prone to earthquakes and flooding and is rapidly sinking due to uncontrolled extraction of groundwater. Congestion is also estimated to cost the economy $6.5 billion a year.

President Joko Widodo announced in August that the capital will move to a site in sparsely populated East Kalimantan province on Borneo island, known for rainforests and orangutans.

Severe flooding and landslides that hit greater Jakarta early last month killed more than 60 people, displaced hundreds of thousands and forced an airport to close.

22,2020/02/25,Paramount halts production of ‘Mission: Impossible VII’ due to COVID-19 outbreak,"The seventh movie in the long-running franchise was scheduled to be shot for three weeks, but the plans have now been put on hold

Filming on the latest installment of Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible franchise has stopped in Italy due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in the European country.

The seventh movie in the long-running franchise was scheduled to be shot for three weeks in Venice, but the plans have now been put on hold.

“Out of an abundance of caution for the safety and well-being of our cast and crew, and efforts of the local Venetian government to halt public gatherings in response to the threat of coronavirus, we are altering the production plan for our three-week shoot in Venice,” a Paramount spokesperson said in a statement.

“During this hiatus, we want to be mindful of the concerns of the crew and are allowing them to return home until production starts. We will continue to monitor this situation, and work alongside health and government officials as it evolves,” the official added.

According to the outlet, Cruise had not travelled to the country for the shoot.

Italy reported its fifth death from the virus and it has the most confirmed cases in Europe.

Christopher McQuarrie is once again directing the new Mission: Impossible film, in which Cruise is reprising his role of Ethan Hunt.

Actors Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson are expected to reprise their respective characters in the film, which will be followed by an eighth installment.

The cast also includes newcomers Nicholas Hoult, Shea Whigham, Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff.

Paramount will release the next Mission: Impossible film for July 23, 2021, while the eighth instalment will bow out on August 5, 2022.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ah6ypg/article30911233.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PARAMOUNT-MI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/paramount-halts-production-of-mission-impossible-vii-due-to-covid-19-outbreak/article30911234.ece
23,2020/02/25,East Timor PM resigns after political coalition collapses,"Mr. Ruak had been backed by a three-party coalition, the Alliance of Change for Progress (AMP), that won 34 of the 65 seats up for grabs in a parliamentary election in May 2018, the country's fifth since independence from Indonesia in 2002.

The Prime Minister of East Timor has sent a letter of resignation to the president, he said on Tuesday, as the tiny Southeast Asian nation faces new political instability after the collapse of a coalition supporting him in parliament.

The Prime Minister has repeatedly failed to secure passage of a budget for 2020 after the largest party in his coalition, the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT) party of independence hero Xanana Gusmao, withdrew support.

“I have sent a [resignation] letter to the president,” Taur Matan Ruak, who goes by a popular name rather than his birthname of Jose Maria de Vasconcelos, told reporters after meeting President Francisco Guterres.

Mr. Ruak said he was prepared to stay in office until the resignation was accepted so as “to guarantee government activities in our country”.

Mr. Ruak had been backed by a three-party coalition, the Alliance of Change for Progress (AMP), that won 34 of the 65 seats up for grabs in a parliamentary election in May 2018, the country's fifth since independence from Indonesia in 2002.

But there has been occasional political deadlock and growing tension after the president, who belongs to the opposition Fretilin party, rejected some ministers proposed by Gusmao, over accusations of graft.

On Saturday, Gusmao, East Timor's first president and a former prime minister, announced a new six-party coalition controlling 34 seats without Ruak's party that he said would prepare to form a new government.

“It is set up to resolve the current political deadlock, he told a news conference. “These six political parties met to put hands together in order to go ahead and form a new government.”

Asia's youngest democracy has been beset by political instability in recent years, hampering efforts to reduce poverty, stamp out corruption and develop its rich oil and gas resources.

25,2020/02/25,COVID-19: White House unveils $2.5 billion emergency request,"The stock market dove Monday over coronavirus fears, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping by 3.6% — or more than 1,000 points.

The White House on Monday sent lawmakers an urgent budget request for $2.5 billion to address the deadly coronavirus outbreak, whose rapid spread and threat to the global economy rocked financial markets.

The White House budget office said the funds are for vaccines, treatment, and protective equipment. The request could advance quickly through Congress and came as coronavirus fears were credited with Monday’s 1,000-plus point drop in the Dow Jones Industrials and are increasingly seen as a potential political threat to President Donald Trump.

The request was released Monday evening and came as key government accounts were running low. The Department of Health and Human Services had already tapped into an emergency infectious disease rapid response fund and was seeking to transfer more than $130 million from other HHS accounts to combat the virus but is pressing for more.

Today, the Administration is transmitting to Congress a $2.5 billion supplemental funding plan to accelerate vaccine development, support preparedness and response activities and to procure much needed equipment and supplies, said White House budget office spokeswoman Rachel Semmel.

We are also freeing up existing resources and allowing for greater flexibilities for response activities. Senators returning to Washington after a weeklong recess will receive a classified briefing Tuesday morning on the government’s coronavirus response, a Senate aide said.

All of the warning lights are flashing bright red. We are staring down a potential pandemic and the administration has no plan, said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who blasted a shortage of kits to test for the virus and President Donald Trump’s proposed budget cuts to health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

We have a crisis of coronavirus and President Trump has no plan, no urgency, no understanding of the facts or how to coordinate a response.

Mr. Trump was a vocal critic of President Barack Obama’s response to the 2014 Ebola scare, which barely touched the U.S. but was seen as a factor in that year’s midterm elections, which restored control of the Senate to Republicans.

Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Monday to defend his record.

The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me! he tweeted.

Among the needs is funding to reimburse the Pentagon, which is housing evacuees from China — who are required to undergo 14-day quarantines — at several military bases in California.

Democrats controlling the House wrote HHS Secretary Alex Azar earlier this month to request funds to help speed development of a coronavirus vaccine, expand laboratory capacity, and beef up screening efforts at U.S. entry points. Azar is slated to testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, and the U.S. response to the outbreak is sure to be a major topic.

The White House budget office, led by Russell Vought, worked with HHS to shape the request, with the agency seeking more than the White House is likely to approve. There is a receptive audience for the request on Capitol Hill, though stand-alone emergency spending bills can be tricky to pass since they are invariably a target for lawmakers seeking add-ons.

The stock market dove Monday over coronavirus fears, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping by 3.6% — or more than 1,000 points.

The quickly spreading virus has slammed the economy of China, where the virus originated, and caseloads are rapidly increasing in countries such as South Korea, Iran, and Italy.

In San Francisco, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took a walking tour of Chinatown on Monday to let the public know the neighborhood is safe and open for business.

Ms. Pelosi, a Democrat who represents the heavily Chinese American city, visited the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory, whose owner Kevin Chan, says his business and others are down 70% since the outbreak of the coronavirus.

In Chinatown, Ms. Pelosi said. Precautions have been taken by our city, we know that there’s concern about tourism, traveling all throughout the world, but we think it’s very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come.

Asked about the Trump administration’s looming request, Ms. Pelosi said she would want to know how the money would be used.

The administration official required anonymity to discuss the request because it is not yet public.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hexwiu/article30910169.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THWHITEHOUSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/white-house-unveils-25-billion-emergency-coronavirus-request/article30910161.ece
26,2020/02/25,Australia spy says interference poses unprecedented threat,"Security Intelligence Organization Director-General Mike Burgess did not identify the countries behind the threats to Australia.

Australia faces an unprecedented threat from espionage and foreign interference but bans on such covert meddling are paying dividends, an Australian spymaster said.

Security Intelligence Organization Director-General Mike Burgess did not identify the countries behind the threats to Australia.

""The level of threat we face from foreign espionage and activities is currently unprecedented,” Burgess said in a speech late Monday that was his first annual threat assessment.

Minor party Sen. Rex Patrick called on the Australian government to call out China, Australia’s biggest trading partner, as a major source of the interference.

""One thing that is missing from the dialogue is calling out the state actor involved,” Mr. Patrick said Tuesday.

""It’s almost certain that in a number of foreign interference circumstances that it is China and we should be calling them out, as the Canadians do, as the U.S. does and the Czechs do,” he added.

But Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, who is responsible for Burgess’ secret service, said the threat was multi-pronged.

""We’re not just talking about China. We’re talking about Russia, we’re talking about Iran and we’re talking about others,” Mr. Dutton told Sky News television.

Chinas has long denied any foreign interference.

Mr. Burgess said the foreign interference in Australia was unprecedented “because of its scale, breadth and ambition.”

Almost every sector was at risk including government, media and universities.

""We’ve seen visiting scientists and academics ingratiating themselves into university life with the aim of conducting clandestine intelligence collection,” Burgess said. “This strikes at the very heart of our notions of free and fair academic exchange.”

Australia angered China in 2018 by enacting sweeping national security legislation that banned covert foreign interference in domestic politics and made industrial espionage for a foreign power a crime.

Individuals lobbying for foreign governments now have to be listed on a public register in a step toward making foreign influence on Australian politics more transparent.

Mr. Burgess said the legislation “is already bringing dividends and is likely to grow in importance for us.”

The Counter Foreign Interference Task Force, established last year to protect universities from foreign meddling, would “become a vital element of our strategy to defeat this threat,” Mr. Burgess said.

The task force also includes a research and intellectual property working group to protect academic freedom and intellectual property. It also safeguards universities against deception and undue influence.

A foreign collaboration working group ensures that collaborations with foreign entities are transparent and don’t harm Australia’s interests.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5enhvl/article25857161.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIAPOLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australia-spy-says-interference-poses-unprecedented-threat/article30910062.ece
27,2020/02/25,Epidemic vs. pandemic? Glossary of terms for virus outbreak,"Here are some of the terminologies being used

OUTBREAK: A sudden rise in cases of a disease in a particular place.

EPIDEMIC: A large outbreak, one that spreads among a population or region. The current outbreak of a flu-like illness caused by a new virus in China is considered an epidemic.

PANDEMIC: Generally refers to an epidemic that has spread on a more global scale, affecting large numbers of people. While there are cases of illness outside China, the World Health Organization said it is not a pandemic. Exactly when enough places have enough infections to declare one isn’t a black-and-white decision. But generally, the WHO is looking for sustained outbreaks on different continents.

CORONAVIRUS: Term for a family of viruses. Some cause the common cold while others cause more severe illnesses like SARS, which stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome, and MERS, which stands for Middle East respiratory syndrome.

COVID-19: Name given to the illness caused by the new coronavirus first identified in China in late 2019. CO and VI are for coronavirus, D is for disease, and 19 for 2019. The virus itself is called SARS-cov-2.

INCUBATION PERIOD: Time between infection and the appearance of signs or symptoms of an illness. The incubation period for the new virus is thought to be up to two weeks.

QUARANTINE: Restrict movement of healthy people who may have been exposed to an infection to see if they become ill. For example, the passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan were quarantined.

ISOLATION: Separate sick people from healthy people to prevent spread of disease. For example, people with the infection are put in isolation in hospitals.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/falnsd/article30829345.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAINCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/epidemic-vs-pandemic-glossary-of-terms-for-virus-outbreak/article30910043.ece
28,2020/02/25,World’s first in vitro cheetah cubs born at Ohio zoo,"The biological mother of the cubs is 6-year-old Kibibi who has never reproduced and is too old to easily become pregnant naturally.

Two cheetah cubs have been born through in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer to a surrogate mother for the first time, Ohio zoo officials announced Monday.

The male and female cubs were born to 3-year-old Izzy at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium on Wednesday, the zoo said in a statement. A team observed the births through a remote camera and are continuing to monitor Izzy and the cubs.

The biological mother of the cubs is 6-year-old Kibibi who has never reproduced and is too old to easily become pregnant naturally.

Kibibi’s eggs were extracted and then fertilized in a Columbus Zoo laboratory on Nov. 19. The early stage embryos were implanted into Izzy on Nov. 21, and an ultrasound reveled she was pregnant with two fetuses about a month later.

South Korea reported 60 more novel coronavirus cases on Tuesday, the smallest increase for four days in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s morning updates.

The country now has 893 cases, the KCDC said— the largest national total anywhere outside China — adding one more person had died, taking the toll to eight.

For the previous three days, KCDC had reported triple-digit increases each morning as the outbreak took hold in South Korea, the world’s 12th-largest economy.

Of the latest cases, 49 are in the southern city of Daegu and the neighbouring North Gyeongsang province, KCDC said.

Most of the country’s infections are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu, an entity often accused of being a cult.

China on Tuesday reported another 71 deaths from the novel coronavirus, the lowest daily number of fatalities in over two weeks, which raised the toll to 2,663.

The National Health Commission also reported 508 new confirmed cases, with all but nine in hard-hit Hubei province. It is up from Monday's 409 cases nationwide.

Multiple provinces in China have reported zero new cases for several days in a row now, with the World Health Organization saying Monday that the coronavirus epidemic has ""peaked"" in China. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the peak in China occurred between January 23 and February 2 and the number of new cases there ""has been declining steadily since then"".

However, WHO expert Bruce Aylward, leader of a joint WHO-China mission of experts, warned on Monday of outbreaks in other countries ""increasing at exponential growth rates"".

Despite a downward trend in new case numbers, China continues to struggle to resume normal activity after the virus brought the world's second-largest economy to a standstill. The country also decided to postpone its annual parliament session for the first time since the Cultural Revolution.

31,2020/02/25,Pakistani Christian woman Asia Bibi seeks asylum in France,"Pak Supreme Court overturned her conviction in a blasphemy case in 2018

Asia Bibi, the Pakistani Christian woman who spent years on death row after a 2010 conviction of blasphemy, said Monday that she was seeking political asylum from the French government.

“My great desire is to live in France,” Bibi said in an interview with RTL radio, her first trip to France since fleeing with her family to Canada in 2018.

Also read: Who is Asia Bibi?

Her visit comes a few weeks after the publication of her book “Enfin Libre!” (Finally Free) in French last month, with an English version due in September.

“France is the country from where I received my new life... Anne-Isabelle is an angel for me,” she said, referring to the French journalist Anne-Isabelle Tollet, who waged a long campaign for her release and later co-wrote Ms. Bibi’s book.

On Tuesday, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo is to bestow an honorary citizenship certificate granted to Bibi by the city in 2014, when she was still behind bars.

She said she did not have any meeting scheduled with President Emmanuel Macron, but “obviously I would like the president to hear my request.” In her book, Ms. Bibi recounts the nightmare conditions she was subjected to in prison until her release in 2018, amid an international outcry over her treatment.

The acquittal sparked fierce rioting in Muslim-majority Pakistan, where Christians are often the target of persecution.

She later fled with her family to Canada, where she has been living in an undisclosed location under police protection.

“Obviously I am enormously grateful to Canada,” Ms. Bibi said, adding that she now wanted to work “hand in hand” with Tollet to urge Pakistan authorities to free others imprisoned over the country’s anti-blasphemy laws.

The allegations against Ms. Bibi date back to 2009, when Muslim field labourers who were working alongside her refused to share water because she was Christian.

An argument broke out and a Muslim woman later went to a local cleric and accused Ms. Bibi of committing blasphemy against the Prophet Mohammed.

But despite her dramatic acquittal by Pakistan’s Chief Justice, activists warned that freedom for Ms. Bibi would likely mean a life under threat by hardliners who have long called for her death.

Last May, she was spirited away to Canada, where Tollet was the only reporter to have met with Bibi since her arrival.

In her book, Ms. Bibi tells of the humiliating and horrendous conditions in prison, and the daily torments suffered by the country’s Christian minority.

She also recounts the difficulty of adjusting to her new life, and the pain of having to leave without seeing her father or other members of her family. .

“Pakistan is my country. I love my country but I am in exile forever,” she wrote.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/x3g4tl/article25487747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14-PAKISTAN-ASIABIBI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistani-christian-woman-asia-bibi-seeks-asylum-in-france/article30907957.ece
32,2020/02/25,These eco-friendly public toilet pods can be used by everyone,"Rethinking public washrooms: This Bengaluru boy has created a prototype of eco-friendly public toilet pods, which can be used by everyone

Out of more than 2,500 students, 21 candidates were shortlisted, and Ullas M was the finalist in Bengaluru among the short-listed at the Nippon Paint 2019 Asia Young Designer Awards (India) edition, curated by Ethos, for attempting to redesign public toilets to be eco and user friendly. “I aim to reinterpret the idea of public washrooms and convert them into barrier-free toilets,” says Ullas.

The idea emerged from a college project assigned to Ullas. “I wanted to rethink the design of public washrooms. I visited public toilets in the city, at metro stations for example. And the two major problems I found were odour and the fact that they aren’t designed for everyone, particularly for the differently abled and the third gender.”

The pods can be placed at frequent intervals. “There are sensors on the façade that is able to discern the height of the user and thereby the floor height can be adjusted this makes it suitable to use for everyone. The pods also come with foldable ramps for wheelchairs, keeping in mind the differently abled,” says Ullas.

Explaining how the toilet pods are eco-friendly, Ullas says “The toilets have solar funnels that tap solar energy, which artificially lights up the toilet at night — this will be of aesthetic value as they will look like street lamps from the outside. The funnel also collects rain water and channels it to the pod below, thereby recharging ground water. There is even a compost tank below that manufactures compost from the waste.” As of now Ullas is in talks with municipal corporations for the implementation of these toilets, which will take some time.

“I also want to present the idea at various platforms.” Ullas says these toilets are cost effective. Communities can build and therefore take ownership of the toilets, and maintain them.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/cx3kbi/article30911123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25bgmUllasMjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/rethinking-public-washrooms/article30911124.ece

Air-conditioner maker Blue Star Ltd. will enter small towns and cities with a view to increasing its market share in the coming years, a top executive said. “We might end the current fiscal with a market share of 12.75% and are targetting 13% for the next fiscal,” B. Thiagarajan, MD, Blue Star Ltd., said. “By FY24, we would like to have a market share of 15%, for which we will be expanding into tier-III, IV and V towns and cities in the coming months,” he said.

Blue Star is likely to end the current year with sales of 6.75 lakh units and the next fiscal with 7.6 lakh units, he said.

The demand from smaller towns and cities are picking up. Having cricketer Virat Kohli as brand ambassador has helped in brand recall value, he said.

In this regard, the company, for the first time, has announced the launch of a new range of ‘premium-yet-affordable’ room air-conditioners, keeping middle-class consumers in mind. A one-tonne, three-star inverter split AC will cost ₹31,990 and a 1.5 tonne AC will be priced at ₹37,990, he said.

The company has also unveiled new models with features such as voice control and air purifier.

Asked about the impact of coronavirus on its business, he said the company would not face any production disruption till mid-April.

“But, there might be some impact after that on supplies of components from our overseas vendors. Even though we source our electronic components from Japan, the vendor, in turn, sources components from China. For other companies, it might be Vietnam, Korea or Thailand. This is a general problem faced by all AC makers,” he said.

He also announced that the company’s Sri City plant would be commissioned by the end of 2021 to cater to the room air conditioner market in the South. This would entail an investment of ₹120 crore in the first phase and another ₹120 crore in the second phase.

The board would meet during mid-2020 to decide on the structure of the Sri City plant as to whether it would be a separate company or a part of the existing one, he said. Mr. Thiagarajan said that the company had effected a 3-5% increase in the prices of room ACs due to hike in ocean freight. He also announced that they had increased the marketing and R&D spend by ₹10 crore respectively.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/a269tt/article30916293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THBUBLUESTAR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/blue-star-eyes-smaller-towns-to-boost-market-share/article30916294.ece

We have contracted for certain varieties of crude for as low as $49 a barrel,” a director of a state-owned oil firm told The Hindu. India is the world’s third largest crude importer and meets 83% of its crude requirements through imports. “China has rejected a significant amount of crude due to spread of coronavirus. This offers a great opportunity for Indian refiners as certain grades of African and Latin American crude oil are available at deep discounts. The freight rates have gone down by almost 50%,” said the head of another refiner.

India has imported 111.4 million tonnes of crude oil from April to September 2019.

R. Ramachandran, Director (Refineries) at Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL) told The Hindu, “We have bought 5 cargoes in the last one month at discounted rates and we are going to buy more. The price of crude has already come down to around $55 a barrel from $70 a barrel due to coronavirus spread and we are further getting discounts as Chinese have cut down their refining capacity.”

Meanwhile, Iraq has become India’s top crude oil supplier by exporting 26 million tonnes to India during April- September 2019, overtaking Saudi Arabia, which sold about 20 million tonnes of crude oil to India during the first six months of the current fiscal.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/w7q3wa/article30916187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THBUBPCL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/indian-refiners-buy-crude-bound-for-china-at-deep-discounts/article30916188.ece

Starting June 1, brokers will not be able to misuse client securities as the capital markets regulator has put in place stringent norms for securities that are pledged for margin requirements.

In a circular on Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) stated that brokers can take client securities only as ‘margin pledge’ and more importantly, such transfers cannot be made to the demat account of the broker.

“With effect from June 1, 2020, TM/CM [trading member or clearing member] shall... accept collateral from clients in the form of securities, only by way of ‘margin pledge’, created in the Depository system,” the circular stated.

“Transfer of securities to the demat account of the TM/CM for margin purposes [i.e. title transfer collateral arrangements] shall be prohibited,” it added.

Further, all such securities transferred as ‘margin pledge’ will have to be kept in a ‘Client Securities Margin Pledge Account’ only. it said.

Meanwhile, the watchdog has given brokers time until June 30 to close all existing demat accounts tagged as ‘Client Margin/Collateral.’

“The TM/CM shall be required to transfer all client’s securities lying in such accounts to the respective clients’ demat accounts. Thereafter, TM/CM are prohibited from holding any client securities in any beneficial owner accounts of TM/CM, other than specifically tagged accounts,” stated the circular.

The SEBI circular comes close on the heels of the board of the regulatory watchdog approving the manner in which pledge is defined to minimise instances of brokers misusing client securities by pledging such shares for their own benefit.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/take-client-securities-only-as-margin-pledge/article30916163.ece
38,2020/02/25,"India can seal trade deal with U.S. much faster, says Goyal","Both countries will engage on a fast track basis, he says

The Free Trade Agreement between the U.S. and India may not take years, Union Minister for Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal said on Tuesday. The two countries had decided to engage on a fast-track basis, given that the two nations can trust each other, he said.

“I think with the U.S., I would personally think that we can do a much larger trade deal much faster..we’re both democracies with a rule of law. I think that’s very important... secondly, we both are transparent,” Mr. Goyal said at an event organised by the CII and the U.S.-India Business Council.

“It’s not that something is going to suddenly spring out somewhere, which was unknown to us. It’s not as if there is something hidden at the back of somewhere, which would never have been on the table. We can trust each other and talk with openness and fairness. And in that spirit, the two nations have decided to engage on a fast track basis. So, I certainly don’t see that this will be like one of those earlier Free Trade Agreement negotiations going for decades and years altogether.”

He added that whatever would be done would be in the best interest of both countries. “It will be, at least from our side an offer that I hope that the U.S. cannot refuse,” he stated.

Replying to a query from the audience, Mr. Goyal said, “I don’t think anybody invests in a country out of charity. The person will invest in a country where there is opportunity. India offers that opportunity. I’m the last fellow to say that we need your money that is why you [should] come here. We have provided you the opportunity, and people are most welcome and we invite and welcome capital and investment but not at the cost of our pride.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/wka9lz/article30916129.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THBUPIYUSH,https://www.thehindu.com/business/india-can-seal-trade-deal-with-us-much-faster-says-goyal/article30916130.ece

40,2020/02/25,"Software is the most malleable factor of production, says Nadella","Wonders if it could be explored for economic prosperity

Software is the most malleable factor of production that mankind has ever found, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said.

Delivering the keynote on ‘Fuelling the tech intensity in India’ here on Tuesday, Mr. Nadella said, “The question is can we explore its [software] malleability and abundance and create more growth and economic prosperity in our societies.”

Addressing a large audience of developers, he shared his vision for the future of technology and explained how Indian organisations should lead in an era of digital transformation.

“I am here in India in the beginning of a new decade. Last decade has been stunning in terms of tech/software impact. There was mobile revolution, cloud happened and a lot of consumer Internet business has been built. However, it has been narrow in terms of achievements,” he commented.

According to him, computing will migrate to where data is going to be generated. Currently, there are a billion Windows devices, and each year, some 300 million devices are getting added to it. Plus, there are a billion iOS devices and two billion Android devices.

“The number all of us have to really pay attention to is, there will be 50 billion connected devices by 2025, that means we will have 50 billion ends points that we get to really harness. Then comes the data part, these devices are expected to generate 175 zettabyte of data, a quadrupled growth, from the current 45 zettabyte,” he said.

Applications built in this decade should have cross-sectoral impacts both in the personal and business fronts, he insisted. The experience layer was becoming more people-centric. “I don’t want to live where my entire world of experience is mediated by just one device. There will be multiple sensors and multiple devices and this is the tech intensity we are talking about.”

Giving out a piece of advice to young and seasoned coders, the master developer said, developers of this decade should keep three things in mind: the broad impact of their tech development, focus on inclusively and importance of building trust.

“Tech has become all-pervasive and ubiquitous in the last 10 years. We now have to think about the responsibilities more broadly, the ethics part of it and how to ensure inclusive growth. We need to build trust into technology, trust around privacy, trust around AI models and trust around security and privacy of customer assets/data,” he listed out.

Microsoft’s goal is to help every organisation to become a software company by adopting the latest technologies. “But the worst mistake anyone could make is reinvent the wheel. You may not get the latest technology in-house, but adopt it, ride and wave and create your own digital technologies, irrespective of what business you run,” he said. as a word of caution.

To support this kind of data growth, he said Microsoft was building Azure, a distributed computing fabric as world’s computer. Azure, is supported from 57 data centres regions of which three are in India. “We have really built out the infrastructure for openness: Windows and Linux, Java and .net and Kubernetes and VMware, all first class. Every layer of the tech stack should meet the real world needs. Data is going to have gravity and compute will migrate to data. We are expanding around the globe, we are also meeting all data residency laws, by complying with changing sovereign regulations globally.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/52j7kc/article30916097.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THBUNADELLA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/software-is-the-most-malleable-factor-of-production-says-nadella/article30916098.ece

42,2020/02/25,Virus adds downside risk to earnings,"Weak Q3 earnings had already dented firms’ capex, hiring

The third quarter of the current financial year has proved to be lacklustre for companies in terms of earnings as many reported a fall in top-line while holding back on capital expenditure (capex) and hiring amid overall economic slowdown.

More importantly, market participants are now expecting further downside risks to the earnings in the current quarter with the economic slowdown accentuated by the COVID-19 outbreak.

According to Edelweiss, the third quarter ended December 31, 2019 was a weak one with the overall top-line of companies under its coverage shrinking 1% and the profit rising by a meagre 3%.

The domestic brokerage, which has a December 2020 Nifty target of 12,300, further said that about 40% of the companies reported a top-line contraction even as businesses across sectors curtailed “costs/conserving cash, causing delays in capex and supressing employee expenses” — a “vicious macro loop” that can only be addressed by sustained export recovery or the government managing its deficit in a better way.

As per the brokerage, the net profit for the first nine months of the current fiscal grew at only 1% year-on-year despite the tax cuts, hinting at clear downside risks to the fourth quarter estimates by more than 30%.

In a similar context, Japanese major Nomura stated it was a muted results season and risks to the market estimates continue to remain.

Nomura analysed the results of 127 companies, representing key sectors and found that the aggregate net sales — excluding financials — declined by 3.7% year-on-year (y-o-y). Further, excluding financials and oil marketing companies, which benefited from inventory gains, the EBITDA growth shrunk 1.5% y-o-y, which was a multi-quarter low.

Nomura has revised its Nifty target to 12,840 from the earlier 13,070 – signifying a gain of less than 9% from the current levels.On Tuesday, the Nifty lost 31.50 points to close at 11,797.90. Incidentally, Nomura is of the view that there is limited upside to market valuations even as further risks could emerge from the COVID-19 outbreak.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/virus-adds-downside-risk-to-earnings/article30916038.ece
43,2020/02/25,Bank credit growth may have bottomed out at 6%: Crisil,"Growth to improve to 9% on a pick-up in economic activity

Credit growth of commercial banks may have bottomed out, which is expected to be 6% this financial year and in 2020-21, the growth could improve to 8-9%, rating agency Crisil said.

“The prolonged slowdown in bank lending may be bottoming out this fiscal, with gross credit offtake set to rise 8-9% on-year in fiscal 2021, a good 200-300 basis points (bps) over the likely growth of around 6% this fiscal,” the rating agency said.

According to data published by the RBI, year-on-year credit growth till January 31 was 7.1% compared with the 14.5% during the same period of the previous financial year.

Crisil said a gradual pick-up in economic activity, continuing demand for retail loans and strong growth in lending by private sector banks should drive the uptick.

Policy measures

“Recent policy moves announced in the Union Budget, and by the Reserve Bank of India are also expected to provide spur,” it said.

After cutting interest rate by 135 bps between February and October 2019 to boost loan demand, the RBI has taken measures such as infusing longer-term funds into banks at repo rate that is lower than the prevailing market — a move to bring down interest rates further.

Crisil said some growth momentum is expected in the January-March quarter, after subdued three quarters, due to traditional fiscal year-ending growth. Also, the RBI’s move to exempt banks from cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirement for incremental credit to certain sectors for up to five years, will also support lending.

“Incremental net domestic credit this fiscal up to December 2019 is just a fifth of what it was a year ago,” the rating agency said, adding lending to the retail segment and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) showed good growth, while credit to corporates and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) declined.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/qfwilm/article30916032.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THBUCRISILHOUSE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/bank-credit-growth-may-have-bottomed-out-at-6-crisil/article30916033.ece

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has clarified that foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) from Mauritius will continue to be eligible for registration as foreign investors in India but subject to increased monitoring.

The regulatory clarification was necessitated after the island nation was placed in the list of ‘jurisdictions under increased monitoring’ — commonly referred to as the grey list — leading to apprehensions that the Mauritius-based FPIs will not be able to trade in the Indian capital market.

“... FPIs from Mauritius continue to be eligible for FPI registration with increased monitoring as per FATF norms,” stated a release by SEBI. On February 21, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) placed Mauritius in the grey list.

This assumes significance since Mauritius accounts for the second-largest chunk of foreign investments, as per data from the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL). In January 2020, Mauritius-based FPIs had total assets under custody (AUC) of ₹4.37 lakh crore, second only to that of the U.S. with₹11.63 lakh crore.

Meanwhile, the capital market regulator further clarified that the FATF website mentions that when a jurisdiction is placed under increased monitoring, it construes that the country has committed to swiftly resolve the identified strategic deficiencies within agreed time frames and is subject to increased monitoring.

46,2020/02/25,BS VI fuel cess may be on cards,"Refiners want to recover ₹35,000 crore invested in upgrading units

Even as India is gearing up to switch over to the world’s cleanest fuel from April 1, 2020, Indian OMCs (oil marketing companies) have made a representation to the government to recover about ₹35,000 crore invested in upgrading their refineries to produce BS VI fuel.

The OMCs plan to recover this money by imposing a cess ₹0.70 to ₹1 on every litre of petrol and diesel.

When asked for comments, R. Ramachandran, director (refineries) at Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL) told The Hindu, “Our (OMCs) aspiration is that we should be compensated to tune of ₹0.70 to ₹1.30 on every litre of BS VI fuel sold. This should be built into the final retail price of the fuel.

“We are engaging with the government for an assurance that we will be allowed to recover the investments made in upgrading our refineries to BS VI over a period of time. This may be in the form of a cess.”

BPCL alone has invested about ₹7,000 crore in upgrading its refineries to produce BS VI-compliant fuels.

Sulphur content

India adopted Euro-III equivalent (or Bharat Stage-III) fuel with a sulphur content of 350 ppm in 2010 and then took seven years to move to BS IV that had a sulphur content of 50 ppm. Transition from BS IV to BS VI took just three years. In, BS VI, petrol and diesel contain just 10 parts per million (ppm) of sulphur.

“All our refineries are already producing BS VI fuels and it’s being sold at many retail outlets now. Today, there is no extra pricing as there is no recognition in the market. We have made industry representation to the government to recover the money. Any life cycle of a project is minimum 15 years and a reasonable payback period is 8 years,” said the director of an OMC.

When asked why the OMCS were seeking government nod for recovering the investments when prices of petrol and diesel had been de-regulated, a senior OMC official told The Hindu, “[The] Government still continues to be the majority shareholder of the companies.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/93ukme/article30915934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THBUPETROLBUNK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/bs-vi-fuel-cess-may-be-on-cards/article30915935.ece

He said there has been an unrecovered amount of ₹46,000 crore on account of penal interest due to delayed GSTR-III-B filing by traders.

Mr. Mitra said owing to Centre’s low tax collection, West Bengal will stand to lose ₹11,000 crore which will be a heavy blow on the State’s finances.

The Minister alleged that the Centre has been steadily increasing cess and surcharges which are not passed on to the States.

“From 2013-14 till now, the Centre has raised cess from six per cent to 18 per cent,” he said.

48,2020/02/25,Sebi probe suggests prima-facie violations of norms in IndiGo related party transactions; shares plunge,"The sources said that a preliminary probe has now suggested violation of certain listing disclosure norms

A preliminary probe by markets regulator Sebi has suggested prima-facie violations of corporate governance and listing disclosure norms in certain related party transactions involving budget carrier IndiGo’s parent firm InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, sources said.

While the company said it has not received any communication from Sebi in this regard, shares plunged sharply in afternoon trade on Tuesday.

IndiGo has been facing a probe by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) ever since a public spat came to light between two founders of the airline, including over certain related party transactions involving one of the warring promoters.

The sources said that a preliminary probe has now suggested violation of certain listing disclosure norms as also of fair corporate governance practices at the company.

InterGlobe shares closed 4.68 per cent lower at Rs 1,376.70 apiece on the BSE, after hitting an intra-day low of Rs 1,334 in afternoon trade after a sudden plunge following media reports about the Sebi probe.

“We would like to state that the news item published in some media reports is factually incorrect and the company has not received any communication from Sebi in this regard,” the company said in a filing to the BSE.

This came after the exchange sought a clarification from the company on the reports.

There was no official word on the probe from Sebi, which has been conducting a thorough probe into the IndiGo matter. All agreements between the two warring founders as well as those between the company and its various investors and associates, including related parties, are being looked into by the watchdog.

The probe has suggested that some of the related party transactions could have been significant and required detailed disclosures and greater vetting by board committees comprising of independent directors, the sources said.

The differences between co-founders and co-promoters — Rakesh Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia — came to the fore in July 2019 after Mr. Gangwal sought market regulator Sebi’s intervention to address alleged corporate governance lapses at the company.

In the wake of the feud, arbitration proceedings are also going overseas between the two promoters’ sides.

Last month, InterGlobe Aviation’s shareholders rejected a proposal of Rakesh Gangwal to amend the company’s Articles of Association (AoA).

Generally, an AoA provides the regulations for operating a company.

The Labour Ministry has implemented retirement fund body EPFO’s decision to restore pension commutation under the Employees’ Pension Scheme, a move that will benefit 6.3 lakh pensioners.

Pension commutation refers to part-withdrawal of fund in advance by a subscriber, who then gets reduced pension amount for 15 years.

With the Ministry’s latest decision, such pensioners would receive their full pension after completion of 15 years.

On February 20, the Ministry notified the decision of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) to restore pension of those who opted for commutation of their pension on or before September 25, 2008.

In this regard, the Employees’ Pension Scheme — run by the EPFO — has been amended.

“The normal pension in respect of those members who availed the benefit of commutation of pension under the erstwhile paragraph 12A of this scheme, on or before the 25th day of September, 2008, shall be restored after completion of fifteen years from the date of such commutation,” as per the notification.

As many as 6.3 lakh pensioners would benefit from the decision. They had opted for commutation of their pension and got a lump sum at the time of retirement from their pension fund on or before September 25, 2008.

The provision for pension commutation of pension was withdrawn by the EPFO. Now, the facility has been restored for all those who opted for it on or before September 25, 2008.

Under the commutation, monthly pension used to be cut by one-third for the next 15 years and the reduced amount was given in lump sum. After 15 years, pensioners were entitled to get the full pension.

In August 2019, the EPFO’s apex decision-making body — Central Board of Trustees headed by the labour minister — approved the proposal to restore commutation of pension for 6.3 lakh pensioners who had opted for the benefit.

An EPFO panel had recommended for amendment in EPS-95 (Employees’ Pension Scheme 1995) for restoration of commuted value of pension to pensioners after 15 years of drawing commutation.

Earlier, under EPS-95, members were allowed to commute one-third of their pension for 10 years, which was restored after 15 years.

A net of 10.08 lakh new enrolments with the EPFO were recorded in December 2019, compared with 10.09 lakh in November last year.

In 2018-19, 61.12 lakh new subscribers on a net basis joined the social security schemes run by EPFO. Similarly, the net new enrolments were 15.52 lakh during September 2017-March 2018.

51,2020/02/25,Display of ‘best before date’ on non-packaged sweets must from June: FSSAI,"At present, it is mandatory to mention these details on labels of pre-packaged/pre-packed sweets

From June, even local sweet shops will have to display the ‘best before date’ and ‘date of manufacturing’ on non-packaged or loose sweets kept in a container or tray for sale at their outlets.

At present, it is mandatory to mention these details on labels of pre-packaged/pre-packed sweets.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has issued a direction in this regard after reports of instances of sale of stale/expired sweets to consumers posing potential health hazards.

“In public interest and to ensure food safety, it has been decided that in case of non-packaged/loose sweets, the container/tray holding sweets at the outlet for sale should display the ‘date of manufacturing’ and ‘best before date’ of the product,” the FSSAI order stated.

This will be effective from June 1,2020, it added.

The regulator said that food business operators (FBOs) should decide and display the ‘best before date’ of sweets depending upon the nature of the product and local conditions.

52,2020/02/25,Overseas investors from Mauritius eligible for FPI registration with enhanced monitoring: SEBI,"The announcement comes after the tax haven was put on the ‘grey list’ of FATF

Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Tuesday said foreign investors from Mauritius will continue to be eligible for Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) registration with increased monitoring as per international norms.

The announcement comes after the tax haven was put on the ‘grey list’ of Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental policy making body that sets anti-money laundering standards.

A significant percentage of FPIs investing in the Indian market is registered in Mauritius.

The island nation is the second largest source after the United States from which foreign portfolio investments come into the country.

As per January NSDL data, assets under custody of US FPIs are worth ₹11,62,579 crore and those from Mauritius stood at ₹4,36,745 crore.

Following the FATF notice, some fund managers knocked on SEBI’s door overnight, raising concerns over validity of FPI registration done through the tax haven.

The regulator on Tuesday said, “Foreign investors from Mauritius will continue to be eligible for FPI registration with increased monitoring as per FATF norms.”

“It is noted from FATF website that when a jurisdiction is placed under increased monitoring, it construes that the country has committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies within agreed timeframes and is subject to increased monitoring,” SEBI said.

In a detailed statement, SEBI said that FATF does not call for the application of enhanced due diligence to be applied to these jurisdictions, but encourages its members to take into account this information in their risk analysis.

Referring to the above, SEBI said that intermediaries should take note of it.

FATF identifies jurisdictions that have significant strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and financing of proliferation.

Jurisdictions under the ‘grey list’ face increased monitoring.

Currently, there are 18 jurisdictions identified as having “strategic deficiencies”, including Mauritius and Pakistan, as per the FATF.

For several years, there have been apprehensions about Mauritius being a money laundering route for FPIs due to its limited regulatory oversight. But, the Indian Ocean island nation has been taking several steps in recent years to address the concerns.

Equity benchmark BSE Sensex was trading 118.15 points higher at 40,481.38, and the broader NSE Nifty was up 32.70 points at 11,862.10.

53,2020/02/25,Apple reopens 29 stores in China for limited hours,"The tech giant closed all 42 retail stores in the country from February 1 based on the latest advice from leading health experts.

Apple has started reopening its retail stores in China and according to the company’s regional Chinese website, 29 out of 42 stores were open for business on Monday, though under limited hours.

Apple Seven Treasures in Qibao is open from 11 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. until March 1, while other outlets like Apple Hong Kong Plaza, will adhere to the restricted schedule until further notice, Appleinsider reported on Tuesday.

Due to an ‘abundance of caution’ as the coronavirus threat loomed, Apple closed all retail stores, corporate offices and contact centres in Mainland China.

Last week, Apple warned that coronavirus outbreak will affect its business in the January-March quarter as worldwide iPhone supply will be temporarily constrained.

In an investor update late Monday, the tech giant said it no longer expects to meet the revenue guidance it provided last month for the upcoming quarter.

“While our iPhone manufacturing partner sites are located outside the Hubei province -- and while all of these facilities have reopened -- they are ramping up more slowly than we had anticipated,” said the company.

“We are gradually reopening our retail stores and will continue to do so as steadily and safely as we can. Our corporate offices and contact centers in China are open, and our online stores have remained open throughout,” Apple informed.

54,2020/02/25,"Small concession to U.S. on dairy, can yield gains in other areas: official","The official acknowledged that the final decision would be based on political factors, given that the dairy sector provides a livelihood to 15 crore Indian farmers

On a day when Indian and American leaders highlighted that mutual tariff concessions would be part of an upcoming trade deal, a senior Commerce Ministry official said that some of those concessions were expected to come from the Indian dairy sector.

“We are not looking at hugely disadvantaging our dairy sector, but without disclosing specific elements [of the negotiations], all I can tell you is that if you can concede a little bit, say a fraction, a very small fraction of dairy, and get something else in return which could be useful for some other section of the industry, then that is what the negotiation is all about,” said Sanjay Chadha, Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Commerce. “This is the kind of thing that, you want a deal, but you don’t want to concede anything. Please understand that a balance has to be struck.”

Mr. Chadha, who has led the Indian delegation in bilateral trade talks with the U.S. over the last year, was responding to a question from The Hindu during a discussion on the Indo-U.S. economic partnership hosted by ICRIER and the American Chamber of Commerce in India on Tuesday.

The Indian trade official acknowledged that the final decision would be based on political factors, given that the dairy sector provides a livelihood to 15 crore Indian farmers, many of whom own just one or two animals. “It’s not so much an economic issue as it is a political one... economically, it may make sense to open up a small fraction of it, but it’s not going to be a purely economic call,” he said.

Farmers’ groups have been vociferous in their demand that agriculture, especially dairy, should be left out of any trade deal. According to the website of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, import tariffs for dairy products range from 30% to 60%, with the highest levels of duties slapped on milk powder, including skimmed milk powder and milk food for babies. People familiar with the negotiations said that the U.S. is pushing for greater market access, via lower tariffs as well as the removal of import quota limits.

One issue that the Indian side has held its ground on is the requirement that imported dairy products are not derived from animals which were fed cattle feed containing non-vegetarian elements.

The demand from Australia and New Zealand for India to open up its dairy market was reported to be a major sticking point in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations that India walked out of last year. Dammu Ravi, India’s lead negotiator at the RCEP talks, reiterated the Commerce Ministry narrative that concessions were necessary.

“The orientation is very important. Do we really want to be an exporting country or not? Because if we don’t correct that perception, then you will always be defensive. You will always think your domestic turf is the be all and end all,” he said, noting that while India had a strong position at the RCEP talks, a political call was taken to opt out. “With this U.S. deal, if we go down to the negotiating table and look at every aspect, there is immense potential for us, and on balance, you have to think, if you are giving, you will gain also. It cannot be one-sided.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9me4o7/article30913791.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Trump-Press-conference-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/small-concession-to-us-on-dairy-can-yield-gains-in-other-areas-official/article30916518.ece

India and the United States on Tuesday strengthened their partnership with agreements on healthcare and energy, and issued a joint statement that designated the two countries as “Comprehensive Global Strategic partners”.

The statement followed bilateral talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump, during which the later renewed his offer to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir and discussed the issue of “religious freedom”.

The discussions took place at Hyderabad House even as communally-charged mob violence in several parts of the city left homes and shops burning.

Addressing a press conference later in the evening, Mr. Trump, however, said he had not discussed the specifics of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, that sparked the violence as he raised issues of “religious liberty” of “Muslims and Christians in India” with Mr. Modi.

“We did talk about religious freedom, and Prime Minister Modi told me very strongly that he wants religious freedom in India, and that they have worked very hard for it here,” he said.

Mr. Trump also said he had discussed the situation in Jammu and Kashmir with Mr Modi. Renewing his offer of mediating between India and Pakistan, which India has consistently rejected, he said the issue of Kashmir had “two sides”.

“I said I will help, do whatever I can do, because my relationship with both gentlemen [PMs of India and Pakistan] is so good. Anything I can do to mediate, anything I can do to help, I will do,” he said, adding that while he understood that the two countries would discuss the issue of Kashmir between them, they had been “at it for a “very long time” without results.

Mr. Trump praised Prime Minister Modi as a “very religious and calm man” and thanked India for the welcome he received both in Ahmedabad and in Delhi. When asked specifically about the CAA, he said the issue was India’s internal matter, and “hopefully they will make the right decision for the people.”

He also referred to the $3 billion purchases of helicopters and other military hardware as a key takeaway of the visit. “They’re buying a lot (of American defence equipment). They’re also going to be buying a lot of our energy; we are going to be the number one country in energy, so that will be exciting,” Mr. Trump said, referring to an MoU on LNG pipeline infrastructure signed between Indian Oil Corporation, and US companies ExxonMobil and Chart industries.

However, two pending agreements between LNG companies Tellurian and Petronet as well as the Westinghouse agreement for nuclear reactors have not yet been finalised.

Other agreements flagged by the Ministry of External Affairs on Space and Intellectual Property Rights also were not finalised during the visit. An MEA official said the unfinished agreements “had some procedural delays and should be ready soon”.

Group on narcotics

The two sides agreed to a “joint working group” (JWG) on fighting narcotics as part of their homeland security dialogue and two MoUs on mental health and safety of medical products were signed. While Indian and U.S. negotiators failed to forge a trade deal in time for Mr. Trump’s visit, Mr. Modi said they would work on a legal framework for a future deal.

A few hours after their joint appearance, Mr. Trump addressed an hour-long press conference alone, where he criticised India once again for the “highest tariffs in the world”, including on the Harley Davidson motorcycles. On strategic issues, Mr. Modi hailed the military and defence partnership and also spoke of their cooperation on keeping a free and open Indo-Pacific.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday invited Indian industry leaders to invest “billions” in America and promised reduced regulations to enhance the ease of doing business in the country.

“Congratulations on your success. We hope you all come to the United States and invest more billions,” Mr. Trump said at an interaction with the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of some of the top Indian companies. “I view it as jobs. We have great people,” the U.S. President remarked, adding that regulations “will only get better” for investment in America.

Chandrasekaran, Aditya Birla Group Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla and the Chairman and CEO of Arcelor Mittal, Lakshmi Mittal.

Responding to a question from B.V.R. Mohan Reddy of Cyient on the regulatory challenges faced by companies investing in the U.S., Mr. Trump said his administration was working on cutting regulations but that they had to adhere to a notice period to do so. “Some of the regulations you have to go through are statutory process... We are going to cut a lot more regulations but we have to give a notice... A lot of them will be cut and you will see a big difference and it will only get better.”

“Earlier today we expanded our defence cooperation with agreements for India to purchase more than $3 billion of advanced U.S. defence equipment including Apache and MH-60R helicopters, the finest in the world,” Mr. Trump said in his press statement. These deals will enhance our joint defence capability as our militaries continue to train and operate together side by side, he added.

The MH-60R helicopters are a critical requirement for the Navy which has an acute shortage on its frontline warships. The Seahawk deal is worth around $2.2 billion and the six Apaches cost around $800 million. To meet the urgent requirement, six Seahawks are expected to be delivered within a year and the rest as per the agreed schedule.

Observing that defence has a major role in the relationship, Mr. Modi said manufacturers of the two countries are becoming part of each other’s supply chains. “In the last few years, there has been unprecedented growth in the inter-operability between our militaries,” he said.

The political arithmetic will largely remain unchanged in the Upper House with elections to 55 seats, but the Opposition expects to bring in qualitative change by nominating many of its heavyweights to the Rajya Sabha.

With its improved situation in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Gujarat, the Congress is set to gain four seats from these three States.

Also Read AIADMK, DMK to search for Rajya Sabha candidates

In Rajasthan, three seats, all held by the BJP are up for grabs. Here the Congress is expected to get two seats. In Gujarat, with its improved tally in the Assembly, the party will gain an additional seat. Out of four seats going for election, currently the BJP has three seats and the Congress one. The party will add another seat in its kitty from Chhattisgarh. Out of the two seats falling vacant in April from the State, the Congress’s Motilal Vohra holds one and the other one is with the BJP. The Congress is expected to win both the seats in the State.

In Madhya Pradesh, where three seats will go for elections, the Congress currently holds one and the BJP two. Party sources said the Congress would try to wrest additional seat here. The Congress will, however, lose from Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Telangana and Himachal Pradesh. “On the balance, we may not increase our tally,” a senior Congress MP said.

Status quo

Out of seven seats of Maharashtra that will go for elections, status quo is expected with no change in the balance between the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance versus the BJP. The Sena is expected to send Priyanka Chaturvedi, former Congress spokesperson who joined the party last year.

Some of the names of Congress leaders who are expected to be seen in the Upper House include Randeep Surjewala, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Malikarjun Kharge, R.P.N. Singh and Jitin Prasada.

The YSR Congress will vastly improve its tally. It currently has only two MPs but will win all the four seats from Andhra Pradesh that are going for elections.

More than numbers, this elections are being closely watched for the personalities expected to enter the Upper House.

Advantage TMC

In West Bengal, elections will be held for five seats. Of these, the TMC will retain all the four seats that it currently holds. However, the fate of the fifth seat depends on the CPI(M) Polit Bureau’s decision. The West Bengal CPI(M) unit is backing the renomination of general secretary Sitaram Yechury to the Rajya Sabha. But the Left will need the Congress’s support to elect him. It remains to be seen whether the party’s Polit Bureau agrees to such an arrangement.

India is preparing to evacuate a large group of its citizens, who are stuck in China’s virus-hit Wuhan city, by a special IAF plane, which is expected to land there with relief medical supplies on Wednesday.

“We are working on our plan for operating the relief flight tomorrow,” said an Indian Embassy message sent to the Indians who have enrolled to go by the special flight.

About 90 to 100 Indians are expected to board the flight.

India has also expressed its willingness to evacuate citizens from the neighbourhood countries.

India had announced plans to send Indian Air Force’s largest plane C-17 Globemaster with medical supplies to China several days ago. Indian officials have blamed China for not granting the requisite clearance, a charge Beijing denies.

However, officials here said on Tuesday that the special flight is expected to land in Wuhan on Wednesday as necessary permissions are being obtained. It is bringing relief supplies like medical gloves, suits and other materials to be used in efforts to combat the COVID-19 in China.

The death toll from COVID-19 has reached 2,663 while the number of confirmed cases jumped to 77,658, Chinese officials said on Tuesday.

India operated two special Air India flights on February 1 and 2 and airlifted 647 Indian nationals, mostly students, and seven Maldivian nationals.

About 100 people were expected to join the third flight which would take them to Delhi where they would undergo quarantine in special camps.

The previous batches were kept at an army camp in Manesar.

In a special note for the Indians in Wuhan and Hubei province who wanted to be evacuated, the mission informed them that arrangements are being made to pick them up and take them to airport.

“Embassy representatives who are already in touch with you individually will directly advise you regarding the exact time of pick up. We are making arrangements for your pick up and onward movement to Wuhan airport by vehicles hired by the Embassy,” the note said.

“You are requested to prepare for departure tomorrow morning bearing in mind the points mentioned in the advisory already issued on this group,” the note told the Indians.

“Kindly note that these arrangements are still tentative and subject to change. We appreciate your understanding and patience,” it said.

Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri recently said that the previous evacuations were difficult and a logistical nightmare as Hubei province and its capital Wuhan were under lockdown since January 23 with a complete ban on transportation services.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kzuhbz/article30915639.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/C-17GLOBEMASTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-prepares-to-evacuate-remaining-indians-from-virus-hit-wuhan/article30915640.ece

64,2020/02/25,The burden to prove citizenship lies on the person claiming it: Gauhati HC,"The Assam Accord of 1985 prescribes the date as the cut-off for detecting and deporting illegal foreigners

The Gauhati High Court has observed that the burden of proving one’s citizenship was on a person claiming the status while dismissing a woman’s petition challenging the order of a Foreigners Tribunal (FT) declaring her a foreigner.

A division bench comprising Justice Manojit Bhuyan and Justice Parthivjyoti Saikia said that the petitioner, Nur Begum of Habigaon in eastern Assam’s Golaghat district, could not prove her linkage to any ancestor who lived in Assam before March 25, 1971.

The Assam Accord of 1985 prescribes the date as the cut-off for detecting and deporting illegal foreigners.

Also Read Assam Accord Clause 6: Panel submits report to Chief Minister

The court referred to Section 6 of the Foreigners Act, 1946, to make the observation. The FTs have been handling cases under this Act since the Supreme Court scrapped the Illegal Migrants (Determination) by Tribunal Act of 1983 that had put the onus of proving a person’s citizenship on the accuser or the authorities.

Ms. Begum, who claimed to have been born in 1986, had submitted eight documents to establish her case. One of these was a school-leaving certificate of 2000 that stated her father’s name as one Raju Hussain, who in another document was found to be included in the voters’ list of 1997.

Also Read Assam Accord Clause 6: Panel submits report to Chief Minister

The other documents included the voters’ list of 1966 showing the name of one Jenurathdin, who the petitioner had claimed was her grandfather, and a voter ID card belonging to one Jahorun Hussain, who Ms. Begum had asserted was her mother.

The court, however, ruled that all the certificates rendered themselves as ‘inadmissible’ in evidence, while referring to the Foreigners Act and the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, to observe that the burden of proving citizenship “absolutely rests” on the petitioner “notwithstanding anything contained in the Evidence Act, 1872”.

The bench also refrained from “reviewing the findings of facts reached” by the FT and said: “In the instant case and as observed above, the petitioner not only failed to discharge the burden but also utterly failed to make proof of the most crucial aspect, that is, in establishing linkage to her projected parents and/or the grandfather... we find no merit in the writ petition. Accordingly, the same stands dismissed, however, without any order as to cost.”

On February 12, Justice Bhuyan and Justice Saikia had dismissed the citizenship claims of Jabeda Begum, a 50-year-old woman who had produced 15 documents, including land revenue receipts, bank documents and PAN card. Police asserted that the woman was absconding from her village in Baksa district.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dton76/article29308474.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NRC-Ritu-Raj-Konwar-Women-waiting-in-queue-about-their-names-on-National-Register-of-Citizens-NRC-draft-in-Morigaon-district-of-Assamjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/proof-of-burden-on-person-claiming-citizenship-hc/article30914833.ece

Groups working on healthcare access in India have said the proposed U.S.-India MoU on Intellectual Property Rights (IP) is a matter of serious concern.

The groups including the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), the National Working Group on Patent Laws, the WTO Campaign for Access to Medicines and Devices–India and the Third World Network (India) Drug Action Forum, Karnataka (DAF-K) have approached the Central government saying the U.S. had been pressing India to make changes in its IP legislation, rules and procedures through the annual United States Trade Representative (USTR) Special 301 reports and was also interested in getting the Indian IP management officials to opt for a stronger IP regime.

“India’s IP laws especially the Patents Act, Copyrights Act and Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act contain robust public interest safeguards against the abuse of IP monopolies. These public health provisions in the Patents Act are crucial for ensuring affordable generic medicines for the people. Therefore, we caution that such a move may undermine the legislative intent behind our Patents Act,’’ the group noted.

US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that issues involving the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are up to India and asserted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants people to have religious freedom.

Mr. Trump, who held comprehensive talks with Mr. Modi on the second and the last day of his visit, said these were great and fantastic two days.

“I’m gonna be not at all controversial because...I don’t want to blow the two days plus two days of travel on one answer, one little answer, like John will ask me one simple question and you will blow it out and that will be the end of the trip. You wont even talk about the trip. So I will be very conservative in my answers if you don’t mind,” Mr. Trump said at a press conference.

Describing the Kashmir issue as a “big problem” between India and Pakistan, he said it is “a thorn in a lot of people’s sides” and reiterated his offer to mediate between the two countries to ease the tension.

“If anything I can do to mediate, I will do,” he said, adding that Pakistan figured in his talks with Mr. Modi.

“I have good equation with Pakistan PM Imran Khan. They are working to control cross-border terrorism,” he said.

He said he discussed the issue of religious freedom at length with Modi during his comprehensive talks and that the Indian leader wants people to have this freedom.

“We discussed it. Prime Minister Modi said they work very closely with Muslims,” Mr. Trump replied when asked if raised the allegations of discrimination against Muslims in India.

Mr. Trump described Mr. Modi as a “terrific” leader and India as a “tremendous country”.

“We did talk about religious freedom. Prime Minister Modi wants people to have religious freedom in India...If you look back India has worked hard for religious freedom,” Mr. Trump said.

To a question about India’s new citizenship law, he said, “I don’t want to say anything on CAA. It is up to India. I hope it will take the right decision for its people.”

Asked if he discussed the incidents of violence taking place during his visit in New Delhi, he said that he didn’t discuss individual attacks and “that is up to India”.

He also said that India is buying a lot of military hardware from the US.

On the issue of trade, he said India is probably the nation with highest tariffs and noted that the Harley Davidson has to pay “huge amount of tariff”.

The US has to be treated fairly, he added.

He also talked about his country’s peace deal with the Taliban with Modi, and said that India will like to see it happen.

The Delhi High Court Tuesday said it would hear on Wednesday a plea seeking registration of an FIR and arrest of persons involved in the ongoing violence in north-east Delhi over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The plea was mentioned before a bench of Justices G.S. Sistani and A.J. Bhambhani for an urgent hearing on Tuesday itself.

The court said however that it would be heard on Wednesday.

The petition filed by human rights activist Harsh Mander and activist Farah Naqvi sought setting up of an SIT to inquire into the incident and compensation for those killed and injured in the violence.

Advocate Sneha Mukherjee, while mentioning the plea, said they are seeking that action be taken against certain individuals who are inciting people and making hate speeches due to which violence has erupted in various areas of north-east Delhi.

It has also sought directions to the Centre for deployment of the Army to maintain law and order in the national capital and areas where the “communal attack on people are most ferocious.”

Clashes broke out between groups supporting and opposing the CAA in north-east Delhi’s Jafrabad and Maujpur on Monday, with protesters torching houses, shops and vehicles, and hurling stones at each other.

Violence has also been reported in Chandbagh and Bhajanpura areas of the city.

Delhi Police head constable, Ratan Lal, was among the nine people who have been killed in the violence that erupted on Monday over the amended citizenship law.

The petition, filed through advocates Fazal Abdali and Nabila Hasan, said that on February 22, around 500 people reached the Jafrabad Metro Station where women were holding peaceful protests against the CAA.

On February 23, BJP leader Kapil Mishra held a rally in support of CAA near Maujpur Metro Station which is situated at a distance of 1.4 kms from Jafrabad Police Station and allegedly made “inflammatory, provocative and inciteful statements” and also posted a tweet on social media in this regard, it alleged.

The petition sought direction to the authorities to register an FIR against Mr. Mishra, Union minister Anurag Thakur and BJP MP Parvesh Verma and others who are allegedly “engaged in criminal activities, including rioting and inciting hatred among classes under the IPC and the Damage of Public Property Act.

It has sought direction to the authorities to declare on their website the full list with names of persons that were detained by the police and paramilitary forces.

It sought to provide detained persons access to their family members and to legal counsel and also to preserve the evidence and CCTV footage of all cameras in and around the protest sites.

72,2020/02/25,India 5th Most Polluted Country In The World: Report,"According to the World Air Quality Report 2019 compiled by IQAir Air Visual, Ghaziabad is the most polluted city in the world

India was the 5 most polluted country in 2019, with Ghaziabad in the National Capital Region ranked as the most polluted city in the world, according to a global compilation of PM 2.5 particulate pollution data by IQAir, a company that primarily works on air filtration.

On the whole, air pollution in India decreased in 2019 from 2018 though about half of the 50 most polluted cities were in India, the report notes. India launched a National Clean Air Programme in 2019 that commits to reducing air pollution in 102 most polluted cities by a maximum of 30% by 2024. The report however notes that the reduction in pollution in 2019 couldn't be attributed to the NCAP but rather was due to a “slowing of the market place.” The economic growth rate in India is expected to slow down to 5% in '19-20 from 6.1% in '18-'19 and 7% in '17-'18, according to the Economic Survey in January.

“Whilst cities in India, on average, exceed the World Health Organisation target for annual PM2.5 exposure by 500%, national air pollution decreased by 20% from 2018 to 2019, with 98% of cities experiencing improvements,” IQ Air said in a press statement.

Bangladesh was marked the most polluted country in 2019 with an average PM 2.5 concentration of 83 µg/m³. Pakistan came next with 65 µg/m³ and India recorded an average of 58.1 µg/m³. In the 2018 version of the IQAir report, the top two countries were the same and India was the third most polluted in the world with an average of 72 µg/m³.

In the 90 country/region-ranking, the Bahamas ranked the cleanest with an average of 3 µg/m³.

For the data, IQ Air relied on pollution recorded by sensors maintained by the government bodies—for India these were mostly the ones maintained by the Central and state pollution control boards—was well as monitoring stations maintained by private organisations.

“The new dataset highlights elevated air pollution levels as a result of climate change events, such as sandstorms and wildfires, and pollution gains from the rapid urbanization of cities, in regions such as Southeast Asia. While some achievements have been made in air quality monitoring infrastructure globally, there are still huge gaps in access to data around the world,” the press statement added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/do96ry/article30849946.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DELHIPOLLUTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/21-indian-cities-among-worlds-30-most-polluted-delhi-worlds-most-polluted-capital-city-report/article30913690.ece

Pakistan on Tuesday raked up the Kashmir issue at the UNHRC here and demanded the immediate lifting of the communication restrictions and release of all the political leaders and activists in the Valley, saying any “inaction” by the international community will only “embolden” India.

Speaking at the 43rd session of the Human Rights Council which is being held here in Switzerland from February 24 to March 20, Pakistan’s Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari alleged that India continues to violate the human rights of the Kashmiri people and demanded the immediate repeal of all actions by India on August 5 last year in Kashmir.

India abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 on August 5 and bifurcated it into two Union territories.

Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue but India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was its “internal matter”. New Delhi has also asked Islamabad to accept the reality and stop its anti-India rhetoric.

She alleged that “over six thousand Kashmiri people, activists... were arrested without the due process of law” and demanded their immediate release.

The Indian Railways earned over ₹9,000 crore from ticket cancellation charges and non-cancellation of wait-listed tickets between 2017 and 2020, the national transporter has said in a response to an RTI application.

The Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS), in response to the RTI application filed by Kota-based activist Sujeet Swami, said that in the three-year period from January 1, 2017 to January 31, 2020, there were over nine-and-a-half crore passengers whose wait-listed tickets were not cancelled. Such passengers brought the Indian Railways revenue of over ₹4,335 crore.

In the same period, the Railways earned over ₹4,684 crore from cancellation fees of confirmed tickets.

In both segments, the earnings were maximum from sleeper class tickets, followed by third AC travellers, the RTI response revealed.

There is also a huge difference in the number of people buying railway tickets through the Internet and those from counters. In the three-year period, over 145 crore passengers purchased tickets through the Internet, while over 74 crore people went to railway counters.

Mr. Swami has filed a plea in the Rajasthan High Court, alleging that the reservation policy of the Indian Railways is discriminatory. He said the difference in policies for online and counter reservation brings unnecessary financial and mental burden upon the passengers and it should be discontinued to give relief to passengers and to stop unfair revenue generation by the Railways.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/e0i4qh/article30772092.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08MYSPITLINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/railways-earned-9000-crore-from-ticket-cancellation-charges-non-cancellation-of-wait-listed-tickets/article30912651.ece

Five judges of the Supreme Court have been affected by Swine Flu, caused by the H1N1 virus, the Union Health Ministry confirmed on Tuesday.

“Five judges were kept in home isolation as soon as the infection came to light and, of these, three judges have already resumed their duty; two continue to be under home isolation/observation and are recovering. The court rooms and residences are being sanitised,” a release issued by the Ministry said.

On Tuesday, Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde met with Supreme Court Bar Association president and senior advocate Dushyant Dave to discuss urgent measures to prevent the spread of infection among judges, advocates, staff and litigants.

Mr. Dave later confirmed that some judges had been taken ill in the past few days. He, however, said he did not know their exact number.

Truncated court

The court itself assembled half an hour late on Tuesday. Some of the judges were on leave. Justice Sanjiv Khanna was seen wearing a mask in the courtroom. Justices Hemant Gupta, A.S. Bopanna and Abdul S. Nazeer did not attend court.

The public relations division of the Supreme Court confirmed that some of the judges had been unwell since the past week, but maintained that all of them had recovered fully.

In court, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud expressed concern about the infection spreading. Justice Arun Mishra was heard cautioning people against coming to court if they exhibited traces of infection.

Mr. Dave said the CJI was concerned for the health of lawyers and litigants and informed him that a central government dispensary would be set up immediately to treat the ill. Mr. Dave has also offered to financially help people unable to pay for their treatment.

Preventive measures

The Health Ministry said preventive measures immediately undertaken by the Ministry include the strengthening of the First Aid Post (FAP) of CGHS at the Supreme Court premises and medical attention to judges in accordance with the protocol.

“Prophylactic treatment was also given to all who have come in contact with them including their family members,” noted the Ministry.

A H1N1 sensitisation workshop for lawyers and other staff members will also be conducted.

The statement issued by the Ministry noted that although H1N1 is a seasonal infection which usually occurs every year with two peaks (One in January to March and other between July to September), everyone is requested to take preventive measures such as covering nose and mouth with a tissue/handkerchief while coughing or sneezing; washing hands often with soap and water; avoiding crowded places; avoiding touching ones eyes, nose or mouth; staying away from crowded places if one has cough/cold; drinking plenty of water and sleeping well.

Ms. Trump, who was accorded a warm welcome by the students of the school, said, “I have learnt that your school’s name “Sarvodaya” means “prosperity for all” and as I walked around, I was able to see how the concept “prosperity for all” is seeped into the curriculum, the leadership of the teachers and the spirit of enthusiasm in the students”.

She added that the school exemplifies that promoting values of kindness, compassion and respect can bring about positive change within the communities and thanked all the educators at the school for providing a promising future for the students. Ms. Trump also advised the students that learning is valuable but being good to each other is also very important

Apart from the happiness class, Ms. Trump spent time reading with primary students and watched a yoga class where the students performed Surya Namaskar.

Radhika, a Class VI student at the happiness class attended by Ms. Trump, said the class had mediated together for five minutes and then discussed the concept of gratitude. “We all had chits of paper and we wrote on it who we felt gratitude towards. We then stuck the chit on a gratitude wall. I wrote that I felt gratitude towards by teachers while Ms. Trump wrote that she feels gratitude towards her family and friends,” Radhika said.

A school band from AGDAV Model Town that played the bagpipes welcomed the First lady while students from the primary section of the school showered her with petals. The students of the schools put up a cultural show as well for the first lady that included a Rajasthani folk dance to the song Padharo Mare Desh and a highly energetic Punjabi Gidda that had the students in the audience join in. The First Lady walked into the audience and interacted with them and even gave a girl a warm embrace.

The happiness curriculum was introduced by the Aam Aadmi Party government in 2018. Although Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Education Minister Manish Sisodia were not a part of the event, they tweeted their excitement.

“@FLOTUS will attend happiness class in our school today. Great day for our teachers, students and Delhiites. For centuries, India has taught spirituality to the world. Am happy that she will take back the msg of happiness from our school,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

India and the U.S. on Tuesday resolved to upgrade their bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership that will include issues such as defence, security cooperation and revitalisation of the Indo-Pacific quadrilateral dialogue.

Both sides also called upon Pakistan to rein in cross-border terror threats and sought justice for the victims of 26/11 attack and the Pathankot terror attack of 2016.

“They called for concerted action against all terrorist groups including Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, the Haqqani Network, TTP, D Company, and all their affiliates,” said a joint statement issued at the end of President Donald Trump’s visit late on Tuesday evening.

South China Sea

Both sides also took note of the efforts of the ASEAN region to create a code of conduct in the South China Sea region. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Trump also agreed to undertake development activities in third countries and intensify cooperation in the space domain

The statement said both sides had resolved to maintain the Internet as a free and secure arena. “India and the United States recognised the need for an innovative digital ecosystem that is secure and reliable, and facilitates the flow of information and data,” the statement said.

Earlier in the evening, Mr. Trump said the U.S. was working with Pakistan to defeat terrorism.

Addressing journalists at Hyderabad House, he said the Indo-Pacific region should be free and open for navigation and the 5G technology should be used for spread of freedom and not for suppression of people.

Mr. Modi observed that defence had a major role in the relationship between India and the U.S.

“In the last few years, there has been unprecedented growth in interoperability between our militaries,” he said, adding the Indian military undertook the maximum number of exercises with the U.S. military.

Mr. Trump also said the U.S. and India were working to revitalise the quadrilateral initiative consisting of Japan, the U.S., India and Australia.

78,2020/02/25,Nirbhaya case: Supreme Court defers hearing of Centre’s appeal to March 5,"Apex court to wait for unfolding of events pertaining to legal and administrative remedies for convicts

The Supreme Court on Tuesday deferred to March 5 the hearing of an appeal filed by the Centre for permission to separately execute the death sentence of the four Nirbhaya case convicts.

A three-judge Bench led by Justice R. Banumathi was informed at the beginning of the session that the trial court had fixed the execution of the four convicts for March 3 at 6 a.m.

The court decided to watch the unfolding of events over the next few days rather than start hearing arguments on the legality of executing convicts separately before the legal and administrative remedies available to their co-convicts are exhausted. If the four convicts are indeed executed on March 3, the appeal would become infructuous on March 5, the court reasoned.

Except for Pawan Gupta, the other three Nirbhaya convicts — Vinay, Mukesh and Akshay — seem to have come to the road’s end of legal and administrative remedies available to them.

Pawan is yet to file a curative petition in the Supreme Court. He has also not filed a plea for clemency with the President.

On February 17, the apex court had asked the government to approach the trial court for issuance of a fresh date for the execution of the death sentence of the convicts. This order was given by the apex court shortly after it dismissed a plea by Vinay challenging the President’s rejection of his mercy petition.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta has been highlighting how the convicts were trying the patience of the nation.

Mr. Mehta made a reference to how policemen who gunned down four gangrape and murder accused in Hyderabad were cheered by the public, calling the incident a symptom of people losing faith in the process of law.

“This case [Nirbhaya] is of 2012 and I am still struggling to execute the death sentence. They [convicts] are acting in tandem to misuse the law by filing one petition after the other… People will stop having faith in the judicial system. Seven years have gone by and the convicts are still playing [with] the judicial system… It is in situations like this that people celebrate encounter killings,” Mr. Mehta submitted on February 17.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pvwn68/article30762656.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-DELHIGANGRAPE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirbhaya-case-supreme-court-defers-hearing-of-centres-appeal-to-march-5/article30911809.ece
79,2020/02/25,Bihar Assembly unanimously passes resolution to not implement NRC,"It also said that National Population Register (NPR) would be implemented in the State in the old 2010 format.

The Bihar Assembly on Tuesday unanimously passed a resolution not to implement the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the State. It also said the National Population Register (NPR) would be implemented in Bihar in the old 2010 format.

In the second half of the State Assembly session, the members of the House unanimously decided to pass the resolution not to implement the proposed NRC in the State.

Earlier, in the first half of the session, opposition parties led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) took on the government over the issue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the NPR and the proposed NRC. MLAs from the RJD, the Congress and the CPI-ML protested against these issues both inside and outside the Assembly.

“When the government has issued a gazette notification to begin the process of NPR in the State from May 15 to June 28 as Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi had tweeted earlier, the Chief Minister should clarify how he has been saying NPR will be implemented in its old 2010 format,” asked Tejashwi Yadav. “It’s a kala kanoon (black law),” said Mr. Yadav and opposition party MLAs.

CPI-ML supporters also marched to the State Assembly in protest against the CAA, the NPR and the proposed NRC.

Later, the Chief Minister said the CAA was a Central issue passed in both Houses of Parliament. “Now, the issue of the CAA is in the Supreme Court to make it clear whether it is constitutional or unconstitutional... On the NRC, the government is clear that it will not be implemented in the State and the NPR should be implemented in its old 2010 format, for which the State government has already written a letter to the Centre”.

Deputy Chief Minister and senior State BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi, who presented Budget in the House, said when the “Chief Minister of the State said that the NPR would be implemented in its 2010 format, there is no question of not doing this”.

Mr. Modi in January had announced that “the first phase of Census 2021 and the process of the National Population Register [NPR] in Bihar would be done between the period of May 15 to June 28, 2020”. Later, he also tweeted to say that a notification iby the Bihar government for the same had been issued on December 18, 2019.

“No government has the courage to stop the NPR exercise in their respective States,” Mr. Modi had added. The Prime Minister and other senior State BJP leaders had even undertaken a ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyan’ in different districts of Bihar to make people aware about the CAA, the NRC and the NPR.

State Assembly Speaker Vijay Chaudhury had to adjourn the proceedings of the House for sometime in the first half of the session after the ruckus created by the Opposition and the ruling party MLAs over the adjournment motion call demand on the CAA, the NRC and the NPR.

Later, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said he has no problem if the House took a unanimous decision not to implement the NRC in the State. Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav, too, supported the move and the House unanimously passed a resolution for the same.

The House also passed a resolution for the implementation of the NPR in the State in the old 2010 format with an amendment on a provision related to transgenders.

“Congratulations to the people of Bihar as their expectations from the RJD has been fulfilled now,” Mr. Yadav said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/nxeu2a/article30913376.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25th-FebPatnaBudget-session-of-Bihar-assembly04jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/din-in-bihar-assembly-over-oppositions-adjournment-motion-call-on-caa-npr-nrc/article30911731.ece

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday said aviation regulator DGCA ought not to have certified action of airlines other than Indigo, which imposed an indefinite flying ban without an inquiry on stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra for allegedly heckling journalist Arnab Goswami on a flight.

In his petition, Mr. Kamra said he was banned by IndiGo for a six-month period before its internal committee even arrived at a decision while other airlines – Air India, Spicejet and GoAir – imposed an indefinite ban on him.

The Supreme Court agreed to hear on February 26 an application for a direction to the Delhi police to ensure the safety of anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protesters at Shaheen Bagh, who are mostly women, in the light of violent clashes which rocked the Capital and left several dead in northeast Delhi.

A Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and K.M. Joseph was urgently approached by Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Aazad, former bureaucrat Wajahat Habibullah and Bahadur Abbas Naqvi on Tuesday for urgent orders.

The court said it would take up the application on February 26 along with a pending Shaheen Bagh case in which the court’s interlocutors have filed a report on the possibility of shifting the protest to an alternative site which would not hamper public and traffic movement.

84,2020/02/25,"Shun negativism, don’t encourage violence: Venkaiah Naidu","Venkaiah says the youth should study issues like CAA before forming opinion

Vice President M. Venkaiah Naidu on Monday urged the youth to shun negativism and not to encourage violence.

Addressing a gathering at the 32nd annual convocation ceremony of Goa University, Mr. Naidu said the youth should “academically study” all issues, like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), ban on triple talaq, and others, before forming their opinion.

“I am happy that in recent times people are talking about the importance of the Constitution. It is, indeed, a positive sign and every citizen must follow the Constitution in letter and spirit,” he said.

Also, everyone should follow constitutional methods to achieve their goals, the Vice President said. “We should not only be concerned about the fundamental rights, but also about duties. Rights and responsibilities must go together.”

Mr. Naidu said the need of the hour is to channel the energies of youths in constructive, nation-building activities. “My advice to youth is to shun negativism and not to encourage violence. There is no place for violence in a democracy,” he said, without referring to any specific instance.

Be constructive and not obstructive or disruptive. Develop a positive outlook, he said. “Some of our troubling neighbours are trying to advise us. They should not meddle in the internal happenings of our country.”

“If you need to progress, then you need to have peace. We can’t have outside interference in India’s internal affairs. We are able to take care of ourselves, thank you,” the Vice President said.

He also appealed to the youth to academically study issues like Article 370 (its scrapping in Jammu & Kashmir), ban on triple talaq, and the CAA before forming their opinion. “Don’t just rely on newspapers and headlines. Take a good advantage of social media.”

Mr. Naidu also said climate change and global warming are two of the biggest challenges being faced by the world, and all nations have to step up their effort to protect the environment and reduce carbon footprint. “We need to ensure that man does not tamper with nature but learns to co-exist in harmony with nature for a greener, life-enhancing future.”

Illiteracy, diseases, challenges in farm sector and social evils like atrocities on women and weaker sections, child labour, terrorism, communalism, and corruption have to be eradicated to build a new and resurgent India, Mr. Naidu said.

He said it is true these challenges have to be fought in a concerted manner by all conscientious citizens, but he expects the youth to be in the forefront of this noble mission. “This is the time for all sections, particularly the youth, to be at the forefront of making India stronger on all fronts. Please remember that discipline, honesty and total commitment to hard work are essential prerequisites for success in any field, including public life.”

The Vice President said people should always select and elect leaders on the basis of “four Cs of good conduct, character, capacity and calibre”, and not on the basis of the other four Cs — caste, community, cash and criminality.

88,2020/02/25,"Regional issues, 5G, cross-border terror likely on agenda","The Trump-Modi meet will be second full fledged discussion since American leader took charge in January 2017

The meeting between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday will be the second full fledged discussion since the American leader took charge in January 2017. Several strategically significant issues like the talks on Afghanistan and the Asia-Pacific cooperation have matured ever since the two leaders met for their first detailed meeting in the summer of 2017.

President Trump has personally backed a risky negotiation with Taliban since he appointed Zalmay Khalilzad as the special envoy on Afghanistan in 2018. The much awaited peace deal is expected to be signed on February 29 with the Taliban in Qatari capital Doha and discussions are taking place among mainstream Afghan politicians about the way ahead for the intra-Afghan negotiation.

India has so far maintained silence about the week of peace which is currently under way in Afghanistan but the return of the Taliban as a prominent overground player is expected to test India’s regional network. In a sign of greater regional dialogue, Taliban sources have indicated that they would be willing to engage other global partners following the signing of the agreement with the U.S. on February 29. President Trump’s mention of Pakistan during his speech at Motera stadium on Monday has also raised the prospect that India will highlight key concerns about cross-border terror attacks in Kashmir from Pakistan during the bilateral talks.

Asia-Pacific grouping

The Hyderabad house dialogue is also the first time that India is hosting the U.S. President since it joined the Asia-Pacific grouping in 2017 that includes the U.S., Japan, and Australia. The Asia-Pacific concept has in recent weeks been critiqued by leading Russian diplomats including Moscow’s envoy to India, Nikolay Kudashev. India has so far maintained that the grouping is not particularly focused on any country, however, that did not deter Chinese and Russian sources from criticising the four-country dialogue.

Telecom sector

On the technology front, discussion on the telecom sector, especially on 5G technology, is also expected to feature in the discussion as the U.S. has repeatedly cautioned India about China’s tech giant Huawei and its ability for surveillance. India allowed Huawei to participate in the 5G trials and yet has not indicated its final stance on allowing the Chinese tech major into the Indian 5G market. In the military and security front, apart from the military purchases, sealing of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) will be an advancement as the deal has been pending for some time.

Apart from these strategic regional and technological issues, both sides have been in discussion over the dairy sector. According to an industry source, both sides have discussed the possibility of granting U.S. access to the dairy market at the same level as India grants to other countries, on the condition that a certification is provided that the cattle feed was vegetarian only.

90,2020/02/25,Police arrange decent burial for abandoned octogenarian,"Family members had ‘dumped’ the elderly woman at a government hospital

In a moving incident, the police helped provide a decent burial for an 85-year-old woman, Kamalamma of Gantavur village of Palamaner mandal, who died on Tuesday after her family members abandoned her on the premises of a government hospital three days ago.

According to information, the elderly woman used to stay with her three daughters-in-law at the village by rotation after the death of her three sons.

After distributing the properties among the three children, the widow had fallen on tough times with nobody taking care of her.

She was reportedly brought to the Government Hospital at Palamaner three days ago by a family member and was dumped at a corner. Some outpatients who noticed the moaning woman brought it to the attention of the hospital staff, who, in turn, admitted to the emergency ward.

The efforts of the hospital staff to bring her family members to the ward failed owing to their alleged reluctance.

The woman died on Tuesday while undergoing treatment.

Once again, the efforts of the hospital staff to hand over the body to the family members went futile. This forced the hospital officials to approach the police.

Sub-Inspector (Palamaner) U. Nagaraju told The Hindu that the police personnel did their best to prompt the three daughters-in-law to share the burden of giving a decent burial to the elderly woman. “As there was no response from them, the matter was informed to one of her grandsons. Finally, he came and took possession of the body and informed us that he was sorry for the development,” the SI said.

Mr. Reddy, sources say, stressed the need for assistance from the World Bank to take forward the government’s ambitious goal of providing drinking water in the State.

The project is estimated to cost more than ₹45,000 crore.

Ambitious project

The CM reportedly explained that the project was likely to be completed by 2022. The government plans to supply clean drinking water to people under the project, which will be implemented by the Water Resources Department in three phases. In all, about 46,982 habitations in rural areas and 99 urban areas would be covered under the project.

Under Phase I, Srikakulam, East Godavari, West Godavari and Prakasam districts will be covered. In the second phase, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam and Rayalaseema districts will be covered. In the third phase Krishna, Guntur and Nellore districts will be covered.

The World Bank team responded positively to the presentation made by Mr. Reddy on the “water grid” and other projects in the State, sources said.

92,2020/02/25,Govt. forcing the poor to part with their land: Chandrababu Naidu,"Development has taken a hit in the State, alleges Naidu

Telugu Desam Party president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has alleged that the YSRCP government is intimidating the poor and taking away their assigned lands on pretext of distributing house sites to all.

Addressing a public meeting at Govindapuram in the Kuppam Assembly constituency on the second day of ‘Praja chaitanya yatra’ on Tuesday, Mr. Naidu said if Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was really interested in providing house sites to the poor and downtrodden, the lands should be procured from the rich and affluent sections but not by forcibly acquiring the assigned lands.

The TDP chief said that the development in the State had gone back to 20 years in the wake of ‘mindless’ decisions of Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Mr Naidu said industrial development was going to be a mirage in the State with many investors retreating from the State, fearing the ‘atrocious’ regime. He alleged that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy was vindictive towards political opponents by ruthlessly trying to weaken them economically, physically and mentally. As the TDP was committed to continuing its struggle for justice, there would be no question of leaving the battlefield, he asserted.

Mr. Naidu observed that the Jagan Mohan Reddy government deprived many poor of their social pensions and ration cards. To prevent the State from getting further damaged, the people should play their part to ensure victory for the TDP in the coming local bodies elections.

Water projects

Charging the YSRCP government with deliberately delaying the water projects in the State, the TDP chief deplored that Polavaram project, ‘the lifeline of Andhra Pradesh people’ was getting dry and its further progress was prevented in the name of reverse tendering. “The TDP government had almost completed the Handri-Neeva and Galeru-Nagari projects for Rayalaseema, but the present government was dilly-dallying the execution of the remaining works. Just ₹20 crore more spending would suffice to bring the HNSS waters to Kuppam region,” Mr. Naidu said, asking the people of Kuppam to fight for the cause.

Earlier, the TDP chief’s arrival in the rural belt was marked by a rousing reception. MLC G. Srinivasulu and senior party leaders from Kuppam, Ramakuppam, Gudupalle, and Shantipuram mandals accompanied Mr. Naidu. Later, Mr. Naidu left for Bengaluru.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ucteu0/article30916506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26ONGNAIDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-forcing-the-poor-to-part-with-their-land/article30916507.ece

95,2020/02/25,Maiden dedicated cargo flight takes off from Vizag airport,"These flights are expected to be a boon to seafood exporters

An exclusive freighter cargo service was launched for the first time from Visakhapatnam airport on Tuesday. The dedicated cargo services, launched by SpiceJet, connect Visakhapatnam with Kolkata and Chennai, thrice a week and with Surat and Chennai thrice a week.

The first ‘SpiceXpress’ from Chennai arrived here around noon and was received by Visakhapatnam MP M.V.V. Satyanarayana, Visakhapatnam West MLA P.G.V.R. Naidu, former MP K. Haribabu, Airport Director M. Raja Kishore, Chief Security Officer Venu Gopal, AP Air Travellers Association (APATA) representatives K. Kumar Raja, D.S. Varma and O. Naresh Kumar, representatives of AP Chambers of Commerce and Industry Federation Pydah Krishna Prasad and G. Sambasiva Rao among others.

Mr. Satyanarayana said that with exports of marine products, shrimp seed and pharma increasing, the dedicated cargo flights would meet the needs of exporters. He said that more cargo flights would be needed in future.

Mr. Haribabu recalled how the domestic cargo terminal and later the international cargo terminal were opened at Visakhapatnam airport to facilitate air cargo exports.

Mr. Naresh Kumar recalled the efforts of the MP and the former MP as also the airport Director in ensuring that the cargo flight was approved by the authorities concerned. As domestic cargo flights have commenced operations, the APATA would now concentrate on bringing international freighters to Visakhapatnam so that exporters could send their products directly to various places in the world. He lamented that international cargo to some destinations was still being sent from Visakhapatnam to Hyderabad by road.

The freighter later left for Kolkata.

These flights are a boon to cargo exporters, especially seafood exporters, who have to export their products in the shortest possible time.

Both domestic and international air cargo from Visakhapatnam, registered an impressive growth during the last two years. The exports from the city include: seafood, auto parts, diamonds and textiles. The domestic and international cargo handled by the airport during the last four years is as follows: 2015-16 – 2,935 tons and 25 tons; 2016-17 – 3,579 tons and 54 tons; 2017-18 – 3,386 tons and 297 tons and 2018-19 – 5,241 tons and 498 tons.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/29r223/article30914547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26-VZ-SPICEJETCARGO1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/maiden-dedicated-cargo-flight-takes-off-from-vizag-airport/article30914366.ece

100,2020/02/25,Woman attempting to sell kidney ‘online’ duped by fraudster,"She was promised ₹25 lakh for a kidney and paid ₹1.2 lakh towards processing charges

The city police helped a woman who lost ₹1.20 lakh to an online fraudster, who allegedly cheated her on the pretext of buying her kidney.

City police’s Spandana programme witnessed the peculiar case of the woman who was ready to sell her kidney for a price of ₹25 lakh getting cheated.

According to police, the woman while searching on Google came across an online advertisement about a person named Dr. Paul Gabriel of Apollo Medical Centre, Anna Nagar, Chennai, looking to buy kidneys from donors at ₹25 lakh each.

The woman who was reportedly in a financial crisis decided to sell her kidney and contacted the numbers given in the advertisement, police said.

However, the woman was asked to pay ₹10,000 towards registration with The National Kidney Foundation initially and was asked to deposit ₹1.10 lakh later in his accounts for various processes, including transfer charge, income tax clearance and others.

After she was further asked to pay money, the woman grew suspicious and approached city police in the Spandana programme on January 6.

The Cyber Crime police then swung into action, reached out to the bankers concerned and ensured that ₹90,000 was credited to the woman’s account. Further, they got a bank account of the accused with ₹24,000 funds frozen.

101,2020/02/25,"Winged guests take diversion, prefer Venkatapuram to Veerapuram this season","Over 1,000 painted storks arrived since November-end

Migratory painted storks of Veerapuram will be the key attraction for bird lovers in the next five months. But the yellow-beaked beautiful birds this season chose to first occupy all available trees in the neighbouring Venkatapuram village and have set up their nests.

In the current season, more than a thousand birds have arrived since November-end and the inflow will continue till March first week, when every tree in Veerapauram village will also be occupied, though only a dozen of them have perched on the trees here. No nests have been set up at Veerapuram by the avian visitors this season.

“Birds have been coming to Veerapuram and checking for a conducive place and going back to Venkatapuram and settling there,” observes Venugopal Reddy, an independent bird enthusiast and farmer from the village.

Long ago when there used to be water in the Veerapuram tank, birds used to perch in large numbers in Venkatapuram and come to the tank for fishing. But slowly over the past couple of decades, Veerapuram had become the hub of activity for these migratory.

“Once the trees in Venkatapuram are full, these birds will begin to occupy the tamarind and other tall trees in our village,” says Mr. Venugopal, who takes special interest in conservation of habitat and rescue of chicks that fall from the nests through an NGO he runs — Save Our Storks. In the 2018-19 season, more than 2,500 birds had come for nesting in the two villages.

Saucer pits

The Forest Department has spent ₹8 lakh this season and constructed 10 saucer pits to store water for the birds at Venkatapuram and Veerapuram and a watch and ward person has been appointed for ensuring the safety of the birds, District Forest Officer R. Jagannath Singh told The Hindu.

Action plan

Some babul trees have been planted in the vicinity of the village so that birds can perch on them.

Meanwhile, the DFO has sent a proposal for a ₹50-lakh action plan for arranging permanent watch and ward at both the villages, constructing water conservation structures and a rescue centre.

A security personnel, who was posted at the hostel in the Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT) IIIT, reportedly posted the video clippings of some students and the dormitories of the girls’ hostel on social media groups, according to an inquiry report.

The university management has ordered an inquiry when a boy of the same institution reportedly sneaked into the girls hostel on February 16. A security personnel videographed with his phone when the staff were breaking open the lock of the hostel room to bring out a girl and a boy who were inside. Later, he allegedly shared the video footages with his friends, which created sensation in the social media.

Speaking to The Hindu on Monday, IIIT Director S.S.S.V. Gopala Raju said after conducting an inquiry, the institute management suspended five security personnel who were on duty at the time and sought an explanation from the security agency.

103,2020/02/25,It is a race against time for RTC,"Corporation to get about 300 new buses meeting BS-IV emission norms by March 31

The Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) will get about 300 new buses meeting BS-IV emission norms by March 31 so that they can be registered on or before that. The Union government decided to leapfrog BS-V emission norms.

While the APSRTC had intended to buy 1,000 buses of various types, and placed orders, with BS-VI emission norms coming into effect from April 1, the APSRTC would be required to wait for some more time to get the new engines with chassis conforming to BS-VI standards. Last year after the government came into power, it had proposed purchase of 1,000 buses, but fund crunch delayed the purchases. Now, there is a very little time for the APSRTC to get the chassis/engine of buses and build the body and get them registered prior to the March 31 deadline.

The Anantapur region with a fleet of 934 buses running on 352 routes, has got sanction for allotment of 63 new buses till March 2021-end. For the current financial year, it had sought 32 uses and of them only four have been sent, and another 35 have been sanctioned for 2020-21 fiscal year.

Sleeper services

RTC Anantapur Regional Manager Sumanth R Adoni told The Hindu that it currently runs one sleeper bus to Vijayawada from Anantapur and proposes to introduce one to Chennai via Tirupati. It has sanction to introduce one each from Tadipatri to Bengaluru and Hyderabad via Anantapur. Two A/C Indra Buses would be introduced from Tadipatri to Bengaluru and Anantapur to Tirupati. A Super Luxury bus is proposed between Anantapur and Bengaluru.

In addition, 67 buses are running from the Bengaluru Interstate Bus Terminal to various locations in the Anantapur region. The Bengaluru terminal in all runs 306 services to all locations in the State and is controlled by the Anantapur region. The region is also in the process of surveying feasibility of introducing A/C bus services from Anantapur to Bengaluru Airport.

Earnings, occupancy fall

The earning per kilometre of the Anantapur Region has fallen from 16% to 9% in the last one year and the fall is significant after January 1. The occupancy rate also has marginally fallen leading to increase in per passenger expenditure from₹42 to ₹43.97. The current earning of the region is ₹1.05 crore per day carrying 2.82 lakh passengers everyday travelling 3.5 lakh km.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/7udaed/article30907667.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25-VJ-RTCRM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/it-is-a-race-against-time-for-rtc/article30907668.ece

105,2020/02/25,‘Bright future for seafood exports from State’,"State contributed 36.16% of exports from the country in 2018-19, says MPEDA chief

Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) has predicted a bright future for seafood exports from Andhra Pradesh due to a steady rise in transportation of consignments from Visakhapatnam.

MPEDA Chairman K.S. Srinivas told The Hindu that during 2018-19, India exported seafood worth USD 6.72 billion with a quantity of 13.92 lakh tonne. During the same period, exports from A.P. were 3.1 lakh tonne with a value of $2.43 billion. The State contributed 36.16% and 22.54% in terms of value in dollar and quantity of Indian seafood exports during 2018-19.

He said they would achieve the target set for current year. “The target fixed for this year is $7 billion and we have crossed more than $5 billion by December, 2019,” he stated.

Vizag port’s share

Asked whether Visakhapatnam was the leading hub for seafood exports, he said the city was the leading port for seafood exports with a quantity of 2.21 lakh tonne worth ₹11,913.07 crore ($1.72 billion) in 2018-19. It was the topmost seafood exporting port and contributed 26% in terms of value and 15.59% in terms of quantity of total seafood export from India.

Mr. Srinivas said world seafood exports accounted for $165.9 billion in 2018. India contributed 4% of world seafood exports, in terms of value, in 2018. China, Norway and Vietnam were the major seafood exporters in the world followed by India in 2018.

On new destinations, he said currently India was exporting seafood to 115 countries including major seafood markets like the USA, China, EU, Japan, Vietnam and Thailand. Bulgaria, Hungary, Luxembourg and Belize were some of the other markets for frozen shrimp with good demand and were yet to be tapped.

“India is also having opportunities for marketing frozen cuttlefish, octopus and squid to Bulgaria and Argentina. Similarly, frozen tuna is another major offering from our side which is having a good demand in Bulgaria, Ecuador and Tunisia,” he disclosed.

Sustainable fishing

Elaborating on the efforts made to promote sustainable eco-friendly fishing, Mr. Srinivas said MPEDA-NETFISH, a society to promote sustainable fishing, were conducting field-level programmes with fishers on sustainable fishing practices such as use of by-catch reduction devices and square mesh cod ends in trawl nets. In addition, NETFISH had also initiated hands-on training programmes on-board long line fishing vessels, he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bright-future-for-seafood-exports-from-state/article30907386.ece

109,2020/02/25,‘CAA will destroy India’,"The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizenship (NRC) will destroy the country, Congress leader M. Mallikarjun Kharge has said.

He appealed to people of all communities, including Dalits, Muslims, Other Backward Classes, Christians, and Adivasis, to continue their fight against the Act.

Mr. Kharge was addressing the ‘Bharat Bachao Andolan’ programme held against CAA, NRC, and NPR here on Tuesday.

The former Union Minister, who criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for bringing an “anti-people act”, said that people of the country irrespective of their religion, caste, community have been raising their voice against CAA. However, Mr. Modi was still defending it. If such an Act is implemented, the entire country will suffer, he said. Mr. Kharge said several people were living in the country from decades without documents. Under such circumstances, what documents will they provide to prove citizenship. “I myself have no documents as my father too had no documents,” he said.

Referring to questions raised by various people, he said that economist Amartya Sen, Urjit Patel, and Raghuram Rajan had criticised the policy of Mr. Modi and warned him to improve the economical status. But, Mr. Modi ignored this warning, he added. Appealing to people to hold peaceful protests, Mr. Kharge said nine people have reportedly died in the Delhi protest.

The State government has planned to build 10 lakh houses next year as part of its commitment to provide affordable housing to the poor, said Housing Minister V. Somanna.

“We have planned to build around 10 lakh houses under various schemes. This includes five lakh houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, 1.2 lakh houses under the Karnataka Slum Development Board, and 2.5 lakh houses (one lakh in Bengaluru and 1.5 lakh in Ballari, Belagavi, Bagalkot, Gadag, Dharwad, and other cities) under the Rajiv Gandhi Housing Corporation,” he said.

He was speaking to presspersons after inspecting the construction of 5,616 houses being built at a cost of ₹338 crore by the Rajiv Gandhi Housing Board near Mundargi area on the outskirts of the city on Tuesday.

Deputy Commissioner S.S. Nakul said that curing compounds were being used to build the houses in Ballari.

“Advanced technology is used and quality is maintained in the construction of the houses. These houses are durable for 100 years. All basic amenities such as planned school, hospital, anganwadi, commercial complex, playground, drinking water facilities, street lamps, garden and underground sewage system would be provided in the newly developed residential area,” he said.

The Minister also offered bhumi puja to commence the work for building Skandsiri Township where 2,172 G+2 houses would be built on a 32-acre plot at a cost of ₹135 crore. The project would be taken up by Sandur Town Municipal Council and implemented by the Rajiv Gandhi Housing Corporation.

“These houses are meant for the economically weaker sections. Those who have a house to live in and have applied for another house in this township, I request them to withdraw their application so that the purpose of providing houses to the houseless could be served,” Mr. Somanna said.

Mr. Nakul added that the District Mineral Foundation funds to the tune of ₹15 crore would be used for providing basic infrastructure to the township.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/evbfqt/article30916217.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGBALLARISOMANNA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-to-build-10-lakh-houses-next-year/article30916218.ece
111,2020/02/25,Committed to holding mass marriages in all govt. administered temples: Kota,"The State government is committed to organising mass marriages in all government administered temples as part of the Saptapadi programme, Minister for Muzrai Kota Srinivas Poojary said here on Tuesday.

“Initially, we thought marriages would be held only on the premises of A grade temples that receive higher amount of donations. But now, some MLAs have requested that marriages be held at B and C category temples too. We will consider that based on the revenue of those temples and the infrastructure facilities available there,” he said.

Each couple will get gifts worth around ₹55,000 that includes 80 grams of gold. The bride will get ₹10,000 and the groom ₹5,000. The marriages will be held in April and May.

He instructed the officers to organise at least 1,000 marriages in bigger districts like Belagavi. The district has three A grade temples — Saundatti Yallamma, Chinchali Mayakka and Godachi Veerabhadreshwar temples. They will host as many marriages as they can accommodate. We will also allow other temples to host marriages if the local MLAs cooperate, the Minister said.

Mahantesh Kavatagimath, MLC, asked the government to create underground drainage facilities in Saundatti Yallamma temple. The government could use a part of the temple’s donations for the purpose, he suggested.

112,2020/02/25,Concern over impact of e-commerce on employment generation,"Former president of Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FKCCI) Sudhakar Shetty has expressed concern over the growing popularity of e-commerce activities and online shopping avenues.

Speaking at an awareness programme on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and Government E-Marketplace (GeM) portal organised by MSME Development Institute, Bengaluru, in association with Mysore Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Mysuru on Tuesday, Mr. Shetty said the online shopping markets and e-commerce activities had led to large scale unemployment in the society.

Traditional businesses and brick and mortar enterprises, which employ a couple of persons each, are being badly hit on account of the online trading options. Lakhs of students are passing out of educational institutes in the country, but they are unable to find jobs, he regretted.

Meanwhile, president of Mysore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) A.S. Satish said their body had extended support to the protest call given by various retail dealers, druggists and distributors associations in Mysuru on February 28.

Speaking on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), Mrs Shetty emphasised the need for people to be aware about IPR to protect and monetise their products and innovations.

He said IPR, which had established itself as an economic asset in the knowledge-driven economy, had become crucial empowerment tools for MSMEs.

He said registration of intellectual property not only restricts others from using your creation without authorisation, but also assures appropriate remedies if it was infringed.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/v72e35/article30916200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGFKCCI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/concern-over-impact-of-e-commerce-on-employment-generation/article30916201.ece
113,2020/02/25,‘Amendment to KSU Act will politicise VC appointments’,"Congress leader H.A. Venkatesh has feared that the appointment of Vice-Chancellors to State universities will become a “political” exercise under the proposed amendment to the Karnataka State Universities (KSU) Act 2000.

Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, Mr. Venkatesh said the proposed amendment envisages the constitution of a Select Committee under the Chief Minister for direct selection of the Vice-Chancellor.

This not only threatens the autonomy of the universities and higher education in the State, but also vitiates the academic atmosphere with political loyalty gaining an upper hand over academic merit, qualification and experience, said Mr. Venkatesh, who had served as a member of the University of Mysore’s Syndicate and Senate.

He said the selection of a Vice-Chancellor by a select committee headed by the Chief Minister would replace the existing system under which a Search Committee comprising representatives nominated by the Syndicate of the respective university, Governor’s office, State government and University Grants Commission (UGC) sends a panel of three names to the Governor to choose from and finalise the appointment.

Mr. Venkatesh cited the appointment of Director of Rangayana in Mysuru as an example. Hitherto, the State government would appoint only theatre personalities approved by Ranga Samaja as the director of Rangayana.

But, the BJP government threw all these conventions to the wind while making its recent appointment to Rangayana, he said.

The proposed system will also give room to sudden change of Vice-Chancellors whenever a new government takes over. The incumbent Vice-Chancellor will be replaced with the one who enjoys the patronage of the government, he said.

The government should have discussed the proposed amendments with academic experts, teachers, researchers and students, he added.

He called upon the people of the State, particularly the academic fraternity comprising retired Vice-Chancellors and retired teachers, to oppose the proposed amendment. which will not only vitiate the academic atmosphere, but also threatens the concept of social justice in the Universities.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/amendment-to-ksu-act-will-politicise-vc-appointments/article30916189.ece
114,2020/02/25,A treasure trove for art lovers,"Museum of Mysuru Paintings opens to commemorate 25th anniversary of Ramsons Kala Prathistana

The 25th anniversary celebration of Ramsons Kala Prathistana, which was established to promote Mysuru’s art and culture, got off to a start here on Tuesday.

Sri Shivarathri Deshikendra Swami of Suttur Mutt inaugurated the celebrations at a function held here in the presence of connoisseurs of art. Artist B.K.S. Varma inaugurated the Ram Singh’s Museum of Mysuru Paintings which has been set up to mark the 25th year of the foundation.

The display of Mysuru paintings includes artworks by 18 contemporary artists from Mysuru and Bengaluru. The visit to the museum located on Zoo Main Road is by appointment and interested persons can call 98801-11625.

R.G. Singh of the prathistana said the Mysuru style paintings on display at the museum had been collected since many decades. The idea behind the museum is to ensure that the traditional art of Mysuru style of painting is not lost to future generations. The museum aims to create a corpus of this art and help in the studies and research by students besides conserving and preserving the paintings, he added.

On the occasion, architect Kuldip Singh, who recently bequeathed his extensive collections of Thanjavur and Mysuru paintings numbering over 400 to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalay in Mumbai, released the booklet “Mysuru Chitra Set”.

A release said here that Ramsons Kala Pratishtana has been commissioning Mysuru paintings from contemporary artists of this style since its inception. The idea behind this was to support the artists. In the beginning the subjects were common, later the artists were asked to recopy rare paintings not represented in the Trust's collection. “At present the artists are provided with our design compositions to create original artworks. We have worked with about eighteen artists of Mysuru style in the past two decades,” the prathistana stated.

The paintings of artist Chandrika N., the fifth daughter of M. Ramanarasiah, Mysuru palace artist, are on display at the museum. She has taught the art to innumerable students at the Sri Jayacahamaraja Traditional Mysuru Style Painting School (SJTMSPS), operating out of Jaganmohan Palace at Mysuru, established by the then scion of Mysuru royal family, the late Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar.

Dundaraja is another artist whose artworks are exhibited. He has been adorned with many awards and recognitions for his art. He has received Mysuru Dasara award and Karnataka Lalitakala Academy award. He is now a visiting faculty at CKP and teaches the basics of Mysuru style paintings, the release stated.

Kala Kuldeep, who was born into a family of artists, is another artist whose artworks had been showcased in the museum. Her father M.B. Basavaraju was a trained artist who had learnt European academic style art from the famed Chamaraja Technical Institute of Mysuru. He was proficient in water colour landscapes and served as the Chairman of the Karnataka Lalitakala Academy, a release stated.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/n70d2i/article30916179.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGMYSPAINTING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a-treasure-trove-for-art-lovers/article30916180.ece

116,2020/02/25,"Yatnal calls Doreswamy ‘fake freedom fighter’, ‘Pak. agent’","BJP leader draws ire of Opposition parties, social movement leaders

Former Union Minister and BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal on Tuesday stirred up another controversy by calling centenarian freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy a “fake freedom fighter” and termed him as being a “Pakistani agent”, drawing the ire of Opposition parties and social movement leaders. Mr. Yatnal also said that those who raise anti-national slogans should be shot and sent to “Jannat” (heaven).

The BJP leader was speaking to presspersons in Vijayapura on Tuesday.

Mr. Yatnal’s remarks came in response to the statement made by former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who at a mammoth protest rally in Vijayapura on Monday, had questioned the role of the BJP and the Sangh Parivar in the freedom movement. He had said that it was the Congress that participated in the freedom movement. “What has been the contribution of the BJP and the Sangh Parivar to the freedom movement?” The ‘Save Constitution Andolan’, in which Mr. Siddaramaiah made the statement, had senior political leaders Yashwanth Sinha, Sitharam Yechury and M. Mallikarjun Kharge on the stage.

On Tuesday, Mr. Yatnal at a press conference asked Mr. Siddaramaiah “Has Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi participated in the freedom movement?” In the same breath, he turned his ire at Mr. Doreswamy, who has questioned the CAA and NRC, and said: “That old man in Bengaluru (Mr. Doreswamy) is a fake freedom fighter and acts as a Pakistani agent.”

Warning those who raise “anti-India” statements, he said they should be directly shot instead of being send to jail.

Meanwhile, Mr. Doreswamy reacted: “If a dog barks, it won’t affect devaloka. He speaks like a stupid. It is better not to react (to such statements).”

Acknowledging that Mr. Yatnal should not have spoken about the centenarian in such language, a BJP spokesperson said that he had been advised in the past not to issue statements that embarrass the party and the government. The party will advice him again and social harmony has to be maintained. “However, the party also feels that Mr. Doreswamy for his stature should remain non-partisan. But, he is biased,” he alleged.

It is not the first time that Mr. Yatnal has raked up a controversy. He had earlier remarked that Muslims need not come to him for any work as “they were not his voters”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cfncr6/article30915709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGBASANAGOUDAPATILYATNAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yatnal-calls-doreswamy-fake-freedom-fighter-pak-agent/article30915710.ece
117,2020/02/25,"In Karnataka, elderly to get ration at their doorsteps","About 1.4 lakh people in State will benefit from decision: Minister

The Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs has decided to provide home delivery of ration to 1.4 lakh elderly people across the State.

Minister for Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs K. Gopalaiah on Tuesday said that in an attempt to make things easy for the elderly, particularly those living alone, the department will ensure delivery of household ration at their doorsteps.

Currently, each family having five members is eligible for 35 kg of rice a month.

Mr. Gopalaiah reviewed the programmes of the department and said food inspectors in the city limits and revenue inspectors in rural areas would be given the responsibility of delivering ration from the PDS shops to homes. He said the process would commence in the next few days.

At the meeting with officials of 30 districts, it was learnt that a large number of aged people had not been collecting ration owing to their inability to go to the shops, Mr. Gopalaiah said.

To crackdown on fake or ineligible families holding BPL ration cards, it had been decided to link all ration cards to Aadhaar cards, he said. A database of cardholders would be generated through e-KYC and officials had been directed to complete the process in one or two months.

Mr. Gopalaiah said 63,922 cardholders had surrendered their cards while 43,000 families had applied for above poverty line cards. The department had collected a penalty of ₹94 lakh from families having BPL cards illegally.

Currently, there are 1.15 crore BPL cards, 20.28 lakh APL cards, and 10.94 lakh Antyodaya cards.

T/he Minister said ration cardholders can purchase their monthly quota from any PDS shop in the State.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/50dz0d/article30918189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HinduTemplateGP375R0553jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/elderly-to-get-ration-at-their-doorsteps/article30915586.ece
118,2020/02/25,"Trump’s visit aimed at destroying agriculture, business industry: Yechury","Sitaram Yechury, general secretary of CPI(M), has said that the visit of U.S. President Donald Trump will not help India and it is aimed at destroying Indian agriculture and business industry.

He was speaking in Belagavi on Tuesday. He was here on his way to New Delhi after participating in a programme at Vijayapura on Monday.

“Mr. Trump is here to make India sign several treaties that are detrimental to the country. There is a likelihood that apart from defence deals, he will insist on agriculture, pharmacy and other deals. There is a serious apprehension that such deals will have adverse impact on our economy,” Mr. Yechury told reporters.

“The U.S. has been forcing us to amend our patent laws so that U.S. companies can produce and sell patented drugs, thus damaging the indigenous pharmaceuticals industry. Mr. Trump will force the government to sign agriculture deals that will open up the Indian market for farm and poultry produce. This will hit dairy and poultry farmers,” he said. Such agreements will also increase unemployment and result in huge losses for Indian industries. We urge the union government not to sign such discriminatory treaties,’’ he said.

“The CAA is discriminatory and unconstitutional. It is unnecessary. Laws that have provisions to give citizenship to refugees already exist in the country. Several persons from Pakistan, Bangladesh and other countries have been granted citizenship under existing laws. Adnan Sami, the singer from Pakistan, has obtained citizenship under the old citizenship law. What was the need to have an amendment that discriminates citizenship seekers based on their religion? he questioned. He asserted that the very purpose of CAA and NRC was to consolidate votes based on Hindutva ideology. Today it is targeting one religion. Tomorrow it may target other faiths. That is a grave threat to pluralism of the country.

Opposition parties had demanded a two-week long special session of Parliament to debate NRC and CAA-related issues. But that was denied. If the debate would have been held, it could have reduced the magnitude of violence that has erupted, Mr. Yechury said. He said his party strongly condemned the violence in Delhi and criticised the failure of the police to contain it. The central government has to be held accountable as the Delhi police is controlled by the central government, he said. The BJP has failed in handling anti NRC / CAA protests. It has failed to win their trust and invite them for a dialogue, he said.

To a question on some anti-NRC/CAA protesters shouting slogans like ‘Pakistan zindabad’, he said: “I will say Hindustan zindabad. I oppose anyone who speaks against my country.” “But in the case of Amulya, who raised the slogan in Bengaluru, we should consider her full statement. She said ‘Pakistan zindabad’, but also said ‘Hindustan zindabad’. It needs to be considered,” Mr. Yechury said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/trumps-visit-aimed-at-destroying-agriculture-business-industry-yechury/article30915524.ece

While in Burkina Faso, Ravi Prakash Pujari, who was extradited to India on Monday, lived with the name Antony Fernandes, which was given to him by his underworld mentor Chhota Rajan in 1994. Pujari shortened the name to Tony Fernandes and used it till he fled to Nepal after the Mumbai crime police began searching for him for his involvement in a series of criminal cases.

After fleeing to Nepal with his associates, Pujari procured a fake passport issued from Mysuru through an agent and went to Bangkok in Thailand, and then to Uganda, where he continued his extortion racket.

When Pujari sensed that the Indian police were getting close down, he shifted to Burkina Faso and lived there for 12 years running hotel, garment and electronic goods businesses before getting a passport from the country.

Pujari shifted to Senegal three years ago. Using the name Vicky Fernandes, he started ‘Maharaja Restaurant’ offering Indian cuisine.

Also read: Social work made him a popular figure

Using the Burkina Faso passport, he travelled to many countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia and even to the USA, ADGP (Law and Order) Amar Kumar Pandey said on Monday, adding that an investigation is on to ascertain the purpose of his visits.

While in Burkina Faso, Pujari continued his extortion racket in India.

He is named in over 97 cases spread across major States in India, including Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala and Karnataka.

Sharing details of the operation to secure his custody and extradite him to India, Pandey said when he and his team went to secure his custody, Pujari, who was visibly shaken, asked them in Hindi, “Are you from India? How come you are here?”

“We told him that we have come to see him as he had called us,” Pandey said.

During the handing over process, Pujari was not aware about the procedure and was under stress. However, after the handing over, the Indian team took him into confidence, offered him tea to make him feel comfortable.

A remark by the Range Forest Officer (RFO) that he would only go by the rules with regard to developing a road in Hebri Range angered MLA Raghupati Bhat and led to a heated exchange between them at the general body meeting of Udupi Taluk Panchayat on Monday.

Earlier, Mr. Bhat had raised the question of developing the road, falling in Udupi Assembly constituency and coming under the Hebri forest range.

To this, Mr. Muniraju, Hebri RFO, said he would follow the rules and go by the law as the road came under the reserve forest. “If you feel what I am doing is wrong, you can complain to my superior officers. I will not do anything illegal,” he said.

Mr. Bhat responded, “We know when to approach your superior officers. We do not need lessons from you. If you keep following rules for everything, the life of ordinary people will become difficult. Don’t put obstacles to the roadwork.”

Mr. Muniraju said that the road was illegal. In response, Mr. Bhat asked, “Whose mistake is that?” Mr. Muniraju said it was not his. This infuriated Mr. Bhat, who pointed out that Mr. Muniraju was sitting on a seat meant for taluk panchayat members.

Mr. Muniraju said there was no place for officers to sit. He also pointed out that four other officers were sitting with him. Subsequently, Mr. Bhat ordered him to sit in the officers’ gallery. Mr. Muniraju responded, “Please be polite. We are government officers.” To which, Mr. Bhat said, “You learn to give respect and then take respect. You should learn to talk to elected representatives.”

Some members supported Mr. Muniraju on the matter of seating arrangement. But Mr. Bhat said, “If one officer speaks like this, the others will follow suit. Elected representatives will have no value. A resolution should be passed against him.”

The MLA also took the Udupi RFO, Clifford Lobo, to task for declining permission to fell trees for widening a road in Brahmavar. “We get funds for widening roads. But you officers block it saying that it is deemed forest. Should we fall at your feet?” he asked.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/7upqby/article30909980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25MNUDUPIRAGHUPATIBHAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bhat-rfo-wrangle-over-road-development/article30909981.ece

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has promised to take up measures to upgrade Anavatti Gram Panchayat in Sorab taluk into a town panchayat.

After kick-starting works on Mudi and Mugur lift irrigation projects in Anavatti on Monday, Mr. Yediyurappa said that Anavatti, which is well connected with a network of roads, has emerged as a buzzing commercial centre in recent times. The upgrade of Anavatti into a town panchayat could result in the creation of necessary civic amenities for the residents and for the farmers who visit to sell their agriculture produce, he said.

Mr. Yediyurappa directed officials of the Department of Water Resources to take measures to complete the irrigation projects in a year. He said that, quality should be maintained when laying pipelines to provide water to agricultural lands under these projects. The completion of Mudi and Mugur lift irrigation projects will provide drinking water to the drought-affected villages in Sorab taluk and irrigate the agriculture land here, he said.

Mr. Yediyurappa also said that work on constructing a bridge across the Sharavathi backwater to connect Kalasavalli with Ambaragodlu and work related to the construction of an airport on the outskirts of Shivamogga city had already commenced.

Kumar Bangarappa, MLA for Sorab, requested the Chief Minister to sanction funds for the upgrade of amenities for pilgrims in Chandragutti. He requested the Union government to give approval for the project to provide railway connectivity between Sorab and Hubballi via Anavatti and Tadasa.

122,2020/02/25,Protests staged against Trump’s visit,"Agitators in Hassan, Mysuru and Shivamogga urge govt. not to ink deals that will hurt farmers, labourers

Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) and Hasiru Sene, in association with the Centre of Indian Trade Unions and Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha, staged a demonstration in Mysuru city against the India visit of the U.S. President Donald Trump, which began on Monday.

The KRRS and others expressed concern that the U.S. would bring pressure on India to further open up the economy. They expressed fear that this would hit the country’s farmers and labourers. Similarly, the Socialist Unity Centre of India flayed the government for “tilting” towards the U.S. and being “subservient” to it instead of pursuing an independent foreign policy. It contended that Mr. Trump was in India to protect the interests of his country’s trade and industry and ensure a market for them.

In Hassan

Members of pro-worker, farmer and student organisations staged a protest over Mr. Trump’s visit in Hassan as well. They asked him to go back without signing any trade deals with the Indian government. Members of KRRS, Students’ Federation of India, and Dalit Hakkugala Samiti staged the protest in front of the Hemavathi statue and burnt effigies of both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Trump.

“The government has built a wall to prevent Mr. Trump from having a look at slums in Gujarat. Both governments are scheduled to sign trade agreements. The agreements will harm Indian farmers and dairy farmers. The Indian government should safeguard the interests of Indian farmers,” one of the protesters said.

In Shivamogga

Activists of KRRS staged a protest at the Mahatma Gandhi Park in Shivamogga city demanding that the Union government desist from entering into any interim trade deals on agriculture with the U.S.

Addressing the protest meet, H.R. Basavarajappa, honorary president of KRRS, said that Mr. Trump’s visit had created apprehension among farmers.

He said the Centre should not sign any deal with the U.S. on opening up the Indian market to agricultural produce from the U.S., including wheat and soya, and on the reduction of import duty on this produce.

123,2020/02/25,Property tax on industrial plots in dispute to be waived?,"Minister Shettar promises to raise issue with Chief Minister

Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar has said he will prevail on Chief Minister B.S. Yeddiyurappa to waive the property tax imposed on industrial plots before they are handed over.

Participating in an interactive session with representatives of industry bodies in Mysuru on Sunday, he said there was an outstanding due of ₹72 crore towards property tax from industrialists on industrial plots across the State, which had not yet been handed over to the allottees. The industrialists had objected to the demand for payment of property tax. In many instances, the allottees had complained that they were unable to take possession of the plots as the farmers or the earlier owners had refused to handover the land to the allottees.

Mr. Shettar said he would urge Mr. Yediyurappa to waive the tax. Unlike the farm loan waiver, where the government decides against taking back the money extended as loan, this will be just a “book adjustment”, he said.

MIA chief reacts

However, industrialists were not impressed with Mr. Shettar’s promise. Mysuru Industries’ Association (MIA) Secretary Suresh Kumar Jain wondered who would be beneficiaries of Mr. Shettar’s promise.

The allottees to whom the plots had not been handed over will not receive any notice from the jurisdictional local body whether it is the gram panchayat, municipality or the City Corporation.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/property-tax-on-industrial-plots-in-dispute-to-be-waived/article30909847.ece
124,2020/02/25,Trump visit will not help India in any way: Kharge,"Terming U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India a design to launch his electoral campaign for the American presidential polls, All-India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary M. Mallikarjun Kharge said on Monday that the visit would, in no way, help India.

“The very purpose of Mr. Trump’s visit to India is launching his poll campaign for the American presidential elections; it is not for enhancing Indo-U.S. ties. [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi had visited the United States and addressed NRIs to win them over for his election. Mr. Trump is following the same idea,” Mr. Kharge told reporters in Kalaburagi.

Pointing to the topics on the agenda for the meeting of Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump, the Congress veteran said there were no issues concerning improvement of bilateral trade ties.

“Mr. Trump has not talked on H-1B visa. There is no discussion on liberalisation of the visa regime. Mr. Trump has, in fact, imposed more restrictions instead of simplifying the process. Instead of talking about such issues, Mr. Trump says it is a personal visit. If he is a personal friend of Mr. Modi’s, the latter should have taken him to his home instead of spending a large amount of public money for welcoming him. His visit will, in no way, help India,” he said.

Mr. Kharge also questioned the need for erecting a tall wall to cover slums from Mr. Trump’s vision. “I don’t know whether the wall was built for security reasons or cover the slums. Such massive and expensive security arrangements were never made for any U.S. President’s visit to the country before. No wall can conceal poverty,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dgztnn/article30909845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGKHARGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/trump-visit-will-not-help-india-in-any-way-kharge/article30909846.ece
125,2020/02/25,"Police working on tracing murder weapon, valuables","SP dismisses police harassment claims

The Chikkamagaluru police, probing the murder of housewife Kavitha at Kadur and the death of her husband Revanth, are making efforts to trace the weapon used to kill her and the valuables that are missing.

The murder, which was followed by two deaths, has created a sensation in the State. Kavitha was found murdered at a house in Kadur on February 17, while her husband was found dead on February 22. A woman, who was allegedly in constant touch with Revanth, was found dead in Bengaluru the same day.

The police suspect that Revanth killed his wife as she was opposed to his affair with another woman. Later, he allegedly jumped in front of a train in fear of being caught by the police. “Our teams are working to trace these two things. The policemen are searching along the route he travelled after the crime. Getting those [items] is crucial in the investigation,” said Superintendent of Police Harish Pandey on Monday.

Revanth and Kavitha had two children. The elder one is five, while the younger one is seven months old. The latter’s naming ceremony was held only recently.

After Revanth lodged a police complaint alleging that some miscreants had killed his wife and stolen valuables, the police launched a probe. After conducting a background investigation, the police called him to the station to get more details. His phone call records were analysed and his correspondence with another woman was unearthed. “There have been efforts by some sections to suggest that he committed suicide because of police harassment, but we treated him as a complainant,” the police officer told The Hindu.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/police-working-on-tracing-murder-weapon-valuables/article30909844.ece
126,2020/02/25,"‘State will lose ₹60,000 crore in tax devolution in five years’","Siddaramaiah says ‘massive injustice’ has been meted out to State

Criticising the 15th Finance Commission’s recommendations pertaining to tax devolution to the State, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah said on Monday that Karnataka would lose nearly ₹60,000 crore in its tax share in the next five years.

“The 15th Finance Commission has meted out a massive injustice to Karnataka. The 14th Finance Commission had recommended 42% tax devolution to States for the year 2019-20, which roughly translates to ₹39,000 crore for Karnataka. But, the State is getting only ₹30,000 crore in 2019-20. As per the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission recommendation, the amount of devolved taxes is going to drop to around ₹28,000 crore in 2020-21, a reduction of ₹11,258 crore. It means that the State will, in the next five years, lose nearly ₹60,000 crore in tax devolution alone,” he said.

“What are [Chief Minister] Yediyurappa and his 25 BJP Lok Sabha members from the State doing? Have they raised the issue with the Centre? How will the State develop when it receives back only 42% of the tax amount it pays to the Centre? The Centre gives little or no money even when we face floods. Yediyurappa himself accepted that the loss caused by the floods last year is estimated at ₹50,000 crores. It is ₹1 lakh crore in my opinion. Yediyurappa is not taking up the issue with the Centre as he is afraid of speaking to [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi and [Union Home Minister] Amit Shah. That is why I often call him the weakest Chief Minister the State has seen,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said.

When asked about Deputy Chief Minister Ashwath Narayan’s statement on the defection of 32 Congress MLAs to the BJP, the former Chief Minister said the dissent was gathering momentum in the BJP, not the Congress.

On the Indo-U.S. bilateral trade pacts expected to be signed during U.S. President Donald Trump’s current visit to India, Mr. Siddaramaiah said there should be no agreement on importing milk from the U.S. as such a move would put domestic farmers, who are producing enough milk required for the country, in deep crisis.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sv1fzl/article30909839.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGKALABURAGISIDDARAMAIAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-will-lose-60000-crore-in-tax-devolution-in-five-years/article30909840.ece
127,2020/02/25,Gulbarga University will get full-time V-C in a month: Dy. CM,"He also says youth empowerment centres will be set up at every school and college across the State

The State government will appoint a full-time Vice-Chancellor for Gulbarga University within a month, said Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Higher Education C.N. Ashwath Narayan on Monday.

Before chairing a meeting with the university staff, he spoke to mediapersons on the main campus of the university. He said the search committee constituted to facilitate the appointment of a full-time Vice-Chancellor would invite applications and fill up the post, which has been vacant for the past eight months.

Mr. Narayan also reiterated that the Higher Education Department had decided to appoint bureaucrats as Registrar (Administration) for effective control and transparency in administration in State-run Universities.

He also said the government was committed to the development of colleges and to improving the quality of the public education system.

Mr. Narayan said the government would set up youth empowerment centres at every school and college across the State offering career guidance and creating awareness on job opportunities in various sectors. The centre will not only guide students to find employment after graduation, but will also help them get scholarship benefits, use the schemes provided by the State and Centre, and access skill development courses and job placement.

Vacancies

He also said the State government would issue notifications soon to fill up vacancies in teaching and non-teaching posts at Gulbarga University. Though the Finance Department had permitted the filling up of 80 posts two years ago, recruitments were delayed as the university failed to abide by the norms. At present, as many as 533 posts, including 183 teaching ones, are vacant, the Deputy CM said.

Nagar, had lodged a complaint with the Mysuru city police in November 2017.

Mr. Sait had alleged that the gangster had threatened to kill him if he did not pay ₹10 crore. Mr. Mahesh had said that Mr. Pujari had cautioned him against entering the poll fray from K.R.

130,2020/02/25,"Hostel vandalised; some vehicles, property damaged","A group of 20 youth enter the premises holding rods, cricket bats and sticks at Sangameshwar Nagar in Belagavi

A group of around 20 youth vandalised the Ambedkar post-matriculation hostel at Sangameshwar Nagar in Belagavi on Sunday night. Some vehicles and property were damaged, but no one was injured.

The group entered the hostel holding rods, cricket bats and sticks at around 10 p.m.

They threw stones at the hostel doors and windows, damaged motorbikes and bicycles and shouted abuses against the inmates.

The students huddled up in some rooms to protect themselves from the attack. The post-matriculation government hostel run by the Department of Social Welfare has around 300 students studying pre-university, degree and post-graduate courses.

Some inmates had gone to sleep while others were studying. And, some had gone out for a walk when the incident happened, said Vijay Kumar Budri, an inmate. “We were terrified as the group entered the hostel premises and went on a rampage. The group members broke windows, banged at our doors and broke the mirrors of two-wheelers. We could not sleep till 3 in the morning,” he said.

Shankar Kanagal, another inmate, said that some local students who were friends with some inmates had got into an argument with outsiders which led to the incident.

“Some of our students go to study at the nearby Buddha Vihar. Some youth who are not inmates of the hostel got into a fight with the local youth. The youth mistook them for inmates and came back to pick up a quarrel with us. Our hostel mates are not involved in the quarrel,” he said.

Deputy Director of Social Welfare Uma Saligoudar visited the hostel later along with police personnel from the APMC Police Station and spoke to the inmates.

Police Commissioner Lokesh Kumar has ordered an investigation.

The police suspected that a minor incident such as troubling a girl might have caused the outrage. “Initial investigation shows that a girl from Kumaraswamy Layout was troubled by a young man. She suspected that he was from this hostel. She went home and told her relatives. Her cousins who wanted to warn the hostel inmates spread the news. That may have led to the incident, in all probability,” said a police officer who has information about the event.

The APMC Police have registered a case against 15 unidentified miscreants for damaging property and under some provisions of the Prevention of Atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act. Another case has been registered based on a complaint by the girl who said that an unidentified boy had made an attempt to molest her on Sunday. “Now, it is our duty to identify the accused in both the cases,” said Mr. Lokesh Kumar.

“Just as Dharwad was divided into three districts in 1997, Belagavi district could be divided too. That would help the people very much as it would make administration more effective. People would not have to travel long distances to seek redressal of their grievances,” he said. He told journalists that he and other leaders would convince Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa about the need to carve out two new districts from Belagavi.

132,2020/02/25,List of demands concerning Kalyana Karnataka submitted,"Hyderabad Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry moves Deputy CM

Hyderabad Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HKCCI) submitted a memorandum listing out various demands concerning the development of Kalyana Karnataka region to Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan here on Monday.

Signed by Amarnath C. Patil and Shashikanth B. Patil, president and secretary of HKCCI respectively, the memorandum focused on six long-pending demands — the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZ), an extension of Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (Bhavantar Yojna) to red gram that is widely grown in the region, making the Information Technology Park in Kalaburagi functional, the establishment of a unit of All India Institute of Medical Sciences or an equivalent institution in the vacant ESIC Medical Complex in Kalaburagi, the implementation of the Kalaburagi Railway Division which has already been sanctioned and finally, the effective implementation of the Special Status accorded to the region under Article 371(J) of the Constitution.

“Kalyana Karnataka is industrially underdeveloped. Its industrial development is possible only if the government, as a measure of policy, establishes SEZs in all the sectors, including IT in the region extensively. Red gram is the bread and butter of not only farmers of the region but also it is the nerve centre of the entire economy of the region as all economic activity revolves around the cultivation of this main crop. But farmers are not properly insulated by policy intervention. The policy of direct procurement from farmers with its inherent weaknesses has not succeeded in addressing their problems. There is a need to adopt and make applicable the Union government-floated Price Deficiency Payment Scheme to red gram. The ambitious IT Park in Kalaburagi is not fully functional. With the Kalaburagi Airport becoming operational, there is no bottleneck in it becoming functional,” the office-bearers said in the memorandum.

“Kalyana Karnataka with its very old railway infrastructure is spilled over in five different railway divisions for the purpose of rail administration. The people of this region need to move around five different railway divisions for the resolution of railway grievances. The Union government sanctioned a railway division in 2013 to be established at Kalaburagi for which the foundation stone was also laid in the same year. The Stat government, as a shareholder with 50 % stake, needs to move the Railway Ministry to establish the Kalaburagi Railway Division,” the memorandum said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/4og28y/article30907903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGAMARNATHPATIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/list-of-demands-concerning-kalyana-karnataka-submitted/article30907904.ece
133,2020/02/25,Villagers facing drinking water crisis block Kalaburagi-Shahbad Road,"Vehicular traffic disrupted for over an hour; officials promise action

Residents of Nandur (B), Nandur (K) and hamlets nearby on the outskirts of Kalaburagi disrupted vehicular traffic on Kalaburagi-Shahbad Road for over an hour on Monday in protest against shortage of potable water.

The protest was led by Raita Abhivriddhi Sangha and Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha. The agitators, mostly women, carrying empty plastic pots, blocked the road for an hour.

Raita Abhivriddhi Sangha president Umapathi Patil said that the villagers have been facing hardships as potable water was not being supplied sufficiently in the village for the past two months.

The villagers have to go to distant places to fetch water, he added. A resident Pramod Patil said that they were facing drinking water scarcity amid borewells going dry.

134,2020/02/25,Infrastructure projects across city hit business at HOPCOMS outlets,"Around 30 outlets have either been temporarily shut or taken a severe hit owing to ongoing works

If the onslaught of online platforms and supermarkets was not enough, ongoing infrastructure projects have now hit operations of Horticultural Producers’ Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society Ltd. (HOPCOMS) outlets in the city.

At least around 30 HOPCOMS outlets in the city have either been temporarily closed or their business has been severely hit mainly due to various ongoing projects, including Namma Metro construction work, white-topping, flyover work, and traffic diversions, said A.S. Chandre Gowda, president, HOPCOMS. Non-completion of the projects within the stipulated time is adding to the woes of the sellers, he said.

A HOPCOMS outlet in Sahakaranagar has been shut owing to white-topping in the area. “We will open the outlet within 10 days. Infrastructure projects are necessary and hence we have to put up with such inconveniences,” said a senior HOPCOMS official. An outlet in Kasturinagar was also closed owing to road repair and was reopened recently.

A HOPCOMS employee said that in many places, the location of the outlet was proving to be a disadvantage. “For example, an outlet on Devasandra Main Road in K.R. Puram is next to the K.R. Puram Market. Though we are doing well, we would have done better had our location had been far away from the market. Since ours is fixed price and market prices vary, many opt to go there,” he said. He also said that a U-turn was closed on Old Madras Road in front of K.R. Puram Market, much to the inconvenience of vendors.

“Now it takes a km extra to reach our place. Previously, if you took the right towards Devasandra Road, you would directly reached our shop,” Mr. Venkatesh said.

Residents’ demands

On the other hand, as farm-fresh fruits and vegetables are in great demand and HOPCOMS provides the same at reasonable prices, people have been demanding the opening of or reopening of HOPCOMS outlets in the city.

The HOPCOMS outlet on Sri Krishna Temple Road in Indiranagar was closed two years ago. Residents met the MD of HOPCOMS and requested him to reopen the outlet which happened recently. Sneha Nandihal of I Change, Indiranagar, said the locality did not have a source for fresh vegetables and fruits that were reasonably priced.

“I do not want to shop from supermarkets because they wax vegetables and fruits to preserve them. Secondly, they are very expensive. However, HOPCOMS provides fresh vegetables and fruits at reasonable prices,” she said, and added that this was the reason they requested HOPCOMS to open an outlet.

More services on its plate

To meet the different demands of its customers, HOPCOMS is planning to offer new services, including providing modern outlets, cold storage facilities and introducing mobile shops.

Basavaraj R. Patil, president, Karnataka State Cooperative Horticulture Marketing Federation Ltd., said they, and the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), have planned to procure sales vans with cooling facilities. “We are waiting for the final approval of the Finance Department. Once we get the approval, we will procure vehicles and use them as mobile HOPCOMS outlets,” he said.

“We will request the government to grant us permission and concession to open our outlets in or around bus stands, government hospitals, railway stations, and on major highways and junctions. We are also planning to reach more gated communities and huge apartments,” said Mr. Gowda. He added that they were also planning to organise melas in and around IT companies and tech parks.

HOPCOMS seeks ₹25 cr. interest-free loan from govt.

To cash in on the increasing demand for fresh and naturally-ripened vegetables and fruits that come directly from the farm, the Horticultural Producers’ Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society Ltd. (HOPCOMS) has proposed the expansion of its services, including store upgrades, opening hi-tech outlets and creation of cold storage facility.

For this, HOPCOMS, with Karnataka State Cooperative Horticulture Marketing Federation Ltd, has requested Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to sanction a long-term interest-free loan of ₹25 crore and to allocate funds to HOPCOMS in the upcoming budget.

A.S. Chandre Gowda, president, HOPCOMS, said the government had always supported the infrastructural development of HOPCOMS, but did not concentrate on the marketing aspect.

“We operate on a ‘no profit-no loss basis’, so there has not been enough emphasis on business and ease of doing business,” he said, adding that if the government agreed to provide them with long-term interest-free loans and other financial assistance, they would invest it on improving business of the society.

Basavaraj R. Patil, president, Karnataka State Cooperative Horticulture Marketing Federation Ltd., said there was an urgent need to integrate cold chain facility, processing and sales. “Though efforts have been made to strengthen, expand and modernise HOPCOMS, we have lagged behind in integrating the important elements of processing, chain facility and sales. This is the biggest hindrance we are facing in competing with private players,” he said.

Mr. Patil also said that there was a need to open outlets for horticultural organic produce across the State, importantly in the city. “There has been demand from all districts, especially in Bengaluru, for organic commodities. Hence, we should aim at catering to new demands of the people,” he said.

An official from the federation also said that it should provide service like the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF). “They have different varieties of milk products. Though we procure different vegetables and fruits, we do not have any byproducts. Hence, we will seek the help of the government in extending and expanding our services. This will not only increase business but also help in tackling the wastage problem. Excess produce will be processed and sold,” the official said.

The federation has recently set up a grape processing unit in Vijayapura to convert grapes into raisins.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/s25cqk/article30907495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGHOPCOMS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/infrastructure-projects-across-city-hit-business-at-hopcoms-outlets/article30907498.ece
135,2020/02/25,16 trekking organisations clean up Shivagange Hill in Nelamangala,"As many as 280 bags of plastic bottles and covers were collected from Shivagange Hill, also known as ‘Dakshina Kashi’ near Dobbspet in Nelamangala taluk of Bengaluru Rural district recently.

Members of 16 trekking organisations, including Bengaluru Trekking Club, India Hikes, Bengaluru Mountaineering Club, Adventure Adda, Green Leaf Adventures, Bangalore Hikers, Mad Adventures, and students of R.V. College of Engineering, took up a cleanliness drive atop the hill. As many as 258 members participated in the drive under the cleanmountains.org, an NGO.

Shivagange Betta is at a height of 2,640 feet, 54 km from Bengaluru. It is popular for rock climbing and youth often trek here in large numbers on weekends. Many pilgrims also visit the hill to offer prayers at Gangadhareshwara and Honnammadevi temples.

Shruthi Kalbargi, a former IT professional and one of the participants, said, “It is nice to contribute by keeping surrounding free of plastic waste.”

Amogh. R. who owns an even management company in Bengaluru, had come to climb the hill. “When I saw people collecting waste, I also wanted to do my bit,” he said. He collected and carried two bags of plastic waste from the hill.

Gangamma, who owns a petty shop on the hill, praised the youngsters and said that because of them, the hill was clean, and visitors would be discouraged from throwing plastic waste in the open.

After collecting the trash, the bags were handed over to Saahas, a waste management firm in Bengaluru. Plastic bottles are bought at ₹15 a kg. When they had sold the plastic bottles during their cleaning drive last year, they had got around ₹18,000, using which they had bought ten dustbins and placed them on either sides of the trekking path and on the premises of the temples, a spokesperson of Cleanmountains said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6ffko2/article30907470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGCLEANINGSHIVGANGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/16-trekking-organisations-clean-up-shivagange-hill-in-nelamangala/article30907472.ece
136,2020/02/25,Gearing up to fight forest fires,"200 ha of dried-up forestland cleared in Palakkad by way of early burning

The Forest Department in Palakkad has stepped up its vigil against fires, especially in the wake of the death of three watchers in a forest fire in Thrissur a few days ago.

The department is procuring safety equipment such as masks and fire-resistant jackets for the watchers. Better equipment is expected not only to help the watchers manage the fires more effectively but also instil more confidence in them.

The fire tender available with the Forest Department in the Palakkad division is put to best use in hot season. “We drench the vulnerable areas using our fire tender. No fire has been reported from South Malampuzha, a sensitive area where we watered this year with the fire tender,” said Palakkad Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Narendranath Veluri.

Forest officials have done ‘early burning’ at a fairly good level as part of keeping wild fires at bay. About 200 ha of dried up forestland was cleared in Palakkad division by way of early burning.

Early burning is usually done before the season becomes too hot. “Once it is too hot, we will not be able to control it,” said Mr. Veluri. In the Mannarkkad and Nemmara divisions too, nearly 500 ha was subjected to early burning. “By early burning, we are removing the fuel for the forest fires,” said Mr. Veluri.

A fire mock drill is being planned for the watchers next week involving the personnel of the Fire and Rescue Services. State’s experienced firemen will monitor the drill and suggest directions to improve the response system.

DFO K.K. Sunil Kumar said the Mannarkkad division was focussing on awareness creation against forest fires. More than three dozen awareness camps had already been held and more were in the offing. Mannarkkad suffered extensive fires last year, consuming hundreds of acres of forestland. The fire at Malleswaran Peak at Attappady had even brought the Indian Air Force choppers to douse it.

Mr. Sunil Kumar, however, expects not much damage this season. “From my last 20 years of experience, I could find dry spells every eight years.

137,2020/02/25,More women donate kidneys,"But fewer women recipients raise a question of bias

There is a stark gender bias in the number of live kidney donations in the State. Of the 4,245 live donations in the past five years, women constitute 63%. However, in terms of recipients, men make up 79%.

Of the nearly 700 kidney transplantations in the State a year, about 5% on an average are through deceased organ donation. The rest are live kidney donations, apparently altruistic. It does raise a question whether women are being exploited in a subtle manner for making altruistic live-related donations, a senior health officer told The Hindu.

Family pressures and money transactions in live-related and live-unrelated donations need to be brought under the scanner, he said.

He said the medical board that had to sanction unrelated live donations would check whether any financial transactions were involved and question the donor on why he/she was donating the organ. There were no checks on the relationship between the donor and the recipient. There were also no proper follow-ups on the health of either the donor or the recipient, as per the government data. A transplant surgeon at a private hospital, on conditions of anonymity, said there were follow-ups as long as the recipient of live-related donation was alive. There were none in the case of unrelated live donors.

A senior transplant surgeon believed that women definitely were more willing to donate whether it was for husband or for children.

“The fact remains that more men than women are afflicted by kidney and liver ailments that may end up as terminal stage diseases,” he added. In the case of live-unrelated donors, the number of women and men queuing up for donation was almost equal, he said.

There were more kidney transplantations in the State, as per information available via a right to information plea. It was also found that no data were available with the government on the rejection rate, follow-ups on recipients and donors, number of second kidney transplantations, and the survival rate.

Though live kidney transplantations are being carried out for nearly 20 years in the State, deceased organ donations picked up only when the State stepped in 2012. The numbers went up dramatically for four years till a case came up in courts questioning brain-death certification. The number of organ donations dropped dramatically from 132 in 2016 to 34 in 2017 and just 14 in 2018. After the courts asked the government to review the process of brain-death certification and much awareness creation on the part of the government, the number of deceased donors went up to 34 in 2019.

Private hospitals have stopped taking an active role in organ donation after accusations were raised about the veracity of brain-deaths.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ngwgz5/article30916693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26tv-kidneycol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/more-women-donate-kidneys/article30916694.ece
138,2020/02/25,Dip in catch hits livelihood of Kerala fisherwomen,"Many small-scale vendors return with empty baskets for days

Pauline, a 55-year-old fisherwoman from Kappil, has been returning with an empty basket from the Neendakara harbour for the past four days.

The boat that had been supplying fish to small-scale vendors remains anchored on the shore after multiple futile trips last week. The dip in marine stock, especially pelagic fish, has put the livelihood of thousands of fisherwomen in the State in jeopardy.

The women, many of them above the age of 50, say they are facing an unprecedented crisis.

“Many varieties abundant some 10 years ago have vanished completely and it is for the first time I am witnessing such a famine-like situation. Women working in small processing units are also in dire straits,” she says.

Matsyafed operates special bus services for them to fish-landing centres and of late the majority of them are taking the trip in vain.

“Today there are 33 women from Thiruvananthapuram on the bus, but only a few got lucky with some anchovy. I have been selling fish for the past 30 years. At this age, it is not possible to start another trade,” says Jenet Cleetus, who is also the Thiruvananthapuram district secretary of the Kerala Swatantra Matsyathozhilali Federation.

The main reason for this alarming dip in catch, she adds, is illegal and unscientific methods of fishing, including night trawling.

Primary earners

In many families, these women are the primary earners and returning with no fish has made their lives miserable.

“Though the boats are bringing hardly any catch, cheap formalin-laced fish from other States are available in the market. As a result, good fish has become dear and often we are not able to afford it. We used to get a basket of mackerel for ₹2,000 early, but now the price has gone up to ₹8,000,” says Mable Rymond, president, Theeradesha Mahilavedi.

Though the Theeramythri programme of the Society for Assistance to Fisherwomen (SAF) has been offering the women alternative options for self-employment, it could not reach out to many, mainly the elderly.

“We are aware of the depletion in fish stock and this financial year we have formed groups mainly focussing on women engaged in fish vending. Around 50,000 women work in the sector and currently we have over 5,000 beneficiaries. At present we do not have any large-scale project, but in future we may be able to assist more,” says Sreelu N.S, Executive Director, SAF.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tkuh07/article30916645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26tvko-Fisherwomen1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dip-in-catch-hits-livelihood-of-kerala-fisherwomen/article30916646.ece
139,2020/02/25,Containers to be secured to trucks at terminal itself,"Adequate rest for drivers, inspections by MVD, police for road safety

Securing containers to truck trays on the container terminal premises itself, ensuring adequate rest to drivers of long-distance heavy vehicles and joint inspections by Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) officials and the police have been mooted to enhance road safety in the wake of the recent Avinashi accident that claimed 19 lives.

Henceforth, containers will have to be secured to the truck’s tray or frame on the skeleton trailer by standardised twist-locks.

Meeting held

A meeting of the Kerala Road Safety Authority chaired by Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran here on Tuesday, decided to ensure that containers were locked to the trailer before gate pass was issued at the container terminal.

The meeting discussed the steps recommended by the MVD team that looked into the Avinashi accident.

The decision to ensure that the containers are fastened properly to the truck was taken after it was revealed that the container on the truck involved in the accident was not secured. The joint team of the MVD and the police, tasked to undertake enforcement in districts, will also inspect container trucks.

Smart card

The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), which had developed GPS for the MVD, was asked to look into the feasibility of introducing a smart card on the lines of the black box for monitoring the behaviour of drivers while they are on the wheel.

The meeting was informed that the State will approach the Centre to restore the two-driver rule for long-distance vehicles.

The State will also take up with the Central government the concerns over the amendments made by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to increase the carrying capacity of goods vehicles by 20-25% and to lower logistics costs by 2%.

The issues faced by 1,900-odd trucks and trailers operating from the Vallarpadam container terminal and the 1,400 trucks that visit the port a day were discussed. Driver fatigue due to the long wait to enter the terminal has come to the notice of the MVD. It was decided to hold a meeting of the port authorities to look into the issues, including parking issues on approach roads.

The PWD officials informed the meeting of the steps being taken to create wayside amenities and resting places for long- distance drivers.

The alignment fixing of the proposed 531.45-km semi-high-speed railway (SHSR) line, or Silver Line, from Kochuveli to Kasaragod has entered the final lap with Kerala Railway Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) receiving the complete LiDAR survey data.

GeoKno India Pvt. Ltd. has completed processing 80% of the high-resolution data collected. However, the KRDCL is yet to receive digital orthophoto quadrangle (DOQ), the computer-generated image of an aerial photograph with necessary technical corrections. On its part, the KRDCL has processed 50% of the data handed over by the agency. A dedicated team is comparing the data with the alignment worked out earlier and the work up to Ernakulam had been completed, official sources said.

Though land at a width of 600 m has been surveyed for the cost-sharing project, it will be set up on a suitable 25-m width.

“There is not much change from the alignment worked out earlier. However, places of worship are being avoided,” sources said.

The initial 300 km of the third and fourth lines from Kochuveli to Thrissur will be mostly parallel to the existing railway track. From Thirunavaya to Kasaragod, they will be parallel to the existing railway line with rail bypasses at Vadakara and Thalassery.

The KRDCL board will be held on March 10 and the alignment will figure in the meeting.

141,2020/02/25,UDF leadership tries to put up a united face,"Panel grapples with infighting in KC factions

The United Democratic Front (UDF) leadership attempted to present a united face on Monday even as a closed-door meeting of its liaison committee sought to heal the differences within the coalition.

P.K. Kunhalikutty, general secretary of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), led the efforts to take the edge off the bitter factional feuds in the Kerala Congress (M) and the Kerala Congress (Jacob). He reminded the leaders that the UDF could ill afford to lose a second Assembly byelection in a row.

Pala loss

The Congress and the IUML felt that the open fight between Jose K. Mani and P.J. Joseph over candidate selection and election symbol had brought about the UDF’s defeat in Pala. A defeat in Kuttanad and a poor show in the local body polls will dishearten the rank and file in the run-up to the Assembly elections in 2021.

By some accounts, Anoop Jacob of the KC(Jacob) demanded that Johnny Nellore, who parted ways with him and aligned with Mr. Joseph, not be allowed to attend the liaison committee meeting in his capacity as party secretary.

The Congress and IUML leaders also engaged Mr. Joseph and Mr. Mani in discussions.

UDF convener Benny Behanan reportedly hoped the KC(M) would be ready for a rethink on the Kuttanad seat.

On ceding Kuttanad

Several leaders felt the UDF stood a better chance of winning if the KC(M) would cede the seat to the Congress. The UDF will meet again in Kochi on February 29 to discuss the matter.

KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said Congress leaders were in lockstep with each other to take the electoral fight to the Left Democratic Front camp.

Later at a press conference, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala sought to refocus attention on Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and the damning the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General on police purchases.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/udf-leadership-tries-to-put-up-a-united-face/article30916595.ece
142,2020/02/25,3 students die in separate incidents in Kannur,"Three schoolchildren died in different incidents in the district on Tuesday.

A Class I student died on the spot after his school bus ran over him. According to the police, 5-year-old Muhammed Rifan, student of Shanthi Nikethan English Medium School in Peravoor, died when he crossed the road after getting down from the school bus. The driver did not notice the child crossing in front of the bus and drove the vehicle over the child.

The body was shifted to the Kannur Medical College, Pariyaram, for the post-mortem.

The police have filed a case under IPC 279 (Rash driving or riding on public way) and 304 A (Causing death by negligence) against the driver.

In another incident, a Class II student of Government LP School, Vellur, near Payyanur, died after he fell unconscious in the school in the afternoon. The deceased was identified as Thej P.V. (7) son of K Sreejith and P.V. Sajitha of Karikuzhi near Vellur. School officials rushed him to the Kannur Medical College Hospital, but the doctors declared him brought dead. The cause of his death is yet to be ascertained.

In the third case, a 17-year-old Plus Two student drowned in the Paripayi river while swimming along with three other friends at Adoor Kadavu in Sreekandapuram.

143,2020/02/25,"No nod for pubs, breweries in State","Cabinet finalises excise policy for 2020-21 without change in dry days and bar timings

The State’s bid to create a late-night world of pubs and bars to attract global investors and woo the IT workforce will remain a non-starter for now.

The government has walked back from a proposal to implement a relatively non-restrictive liquor policy that entailed breweries and draught beer pubs, reduced number of dry days and enhanced bar timings.

Instead, the Cabinet, which finalised the excise policy for 2020-21 on Tuesday, gave a fillip to the toddy sector that employs thousands of workers who constitute the traditional support base of the Left Democratic Front (LDF). The compulsions of realpolitik appeared to have carried the day.

Liquor is a politically sensitive subject in Kerala, and the ruling front seemed wary of a political backlash from the Opposition, powered by Church-backed prohibitionists. The upcoming local body polls and Assembly byelection in Kuttanad also may have acted as a brake.

Boost for toddy sector

The government has given toddy shops considerable latitude in conducting their business in a limited regulatory atmosphere. It has legalised the sale of food through toddy shops. It has increased the upper limit of the legally permissible yield of coconut sap from a palm from the current 1.5 litres to 2 litres. The offset of 200 m from places of worship, burial and educational institutions will not apply to buildings from which toddy parlours operate currently.

An estimated 5,071 toddy shops will go under the hammer for a lease period of three years soon. Current licensees will get preference for a permit.

The government has upped the liquor licence fee for private member clubs from ₹15 lakh to ₹20 lakh and that for bar hotels from ₹28 lakh to ₹30 lakh. Airport bar fee has been hiked from ₹1 lakh to ₹2 lakh.

There is no change in the conditions for grant of liquor licences. Three-star and above hotels continue to be eligible for bar licence.

144,2020/02/25,Facelift for Thookkupalam market,"Grama panchayat plans to construct high-tech market at an estimate of ₹3 crore

The weekly public market on Sundays at Thookkupalam is live with sellers, who mostly come from Tamil Nadu. And buyers are largely local people, with the market slowly losing prominence over the years.

The Thookkupalam market was the first one of its kind in the Idukki high ranges. It evolved with the creation of Pattom Colony at Kallar in 1955 as part of the ‘Grow more food scheme’ to tide over food shortage after World War II.

The colony was created in the name of Pattom A. Thanu Pillai, the Chief Minister of erstwhile Thiru-Kochi, and a few families were given five acres each to grow food items at Kallar.

As per available documents, the Thookkupalam market was extended on the land provided by Karamangattu K.K. Raman Nair in 1964. It became the main rice market with traders from Kochi, Kottayam, and Alappuzha reaching there.

“Rice was kept at Ramakkalmedu bordering Tamil Nadu and brought to the market for selling it to buyers from far away places,” said Karunapuram grama panchayat president Tomy Plavuvachathil. Vegetables grown in Tamil Nadu were also brought to the Thookkuplam market so were the food items grown by the first settlers. In course of time, buildings were constructed there, he added.

It was also said that a major cattle market functioned in the early period of settlement at Thookkupalam. Cattle were brought from Tamil Nadu and sold in the early hours so that they could be moved to destinations by evening.

Border routes

The many routes across the border were developed for moving cattle and goods in the early period of settlement. Goods were mostly borne by labourers across the border those days through narrow paths across the border. Donkeys were also used.

As local markets emerged, the Thookkuplam market lost its glory.

The panchayat was planning to construct a high-tech market in its place at an estimate of ₹3 crore, Mr Tomy said. The work on the market would bein soon, he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/1zr1xo/article30916488.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26tvmarket,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/facelift-for-thookkupalam-market/article30916482.ece

149,2020/02/25,P. Bhaskaran Award presented to Jayakumar,"Lyricists should be considered on a par with poets, says M.T.

Writer M.T. Vasudevan Nair has said that K. Jayakumar, former Chief Secretary and Vice Chancellor of Malayalam University, is the most appropriate candidate for the award instituted in memory of the late lyricist P. Bhaskaran.

“P. Bhaskaran and K. Jayakumar are two people who truly define the term multi-talented,” M.T. said in his address after presenting the third P.Bhaskaran award to Mr. Jayakumar here on Tuesday.

Multi-talented

Recalling that Bhaskaran had penned over 3,000 songs, he criticised those who belittled lyricists and did not consider them as being on par with poets. Bhaskaran was a lyricist, composer, filmmaker and actor, besides being a poet, M.T. said.

“It is not difficult to make the lyrics of a song look like a poem, but not vice versa”, he said, pointing out that noted American lyricist and composer Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize and nobody batted an eyelid, while O.N.V. Kurup receiving the Padmasree was frowned upon by many in Kerala.

He said that even Rabindranath Tagore was a lyricist and composer who created his own genre of music.

M.T. said that Mr. Jayakumar’s prose writings, including his translations, were deep and beautiful like his poems and lyrics.

“He, like P. Bhaskaran, has penned songs that have become part of the lives and culture of a generation of people, the exact reason why Bob Dylan was given the Nobel Prize”.

150,2020/02/25,Intermittent fasting: A worthy lifestyle option,"Intermittent fasting has more scientific backing

If you are one who is looking to eat healthy and have been playing around with fad diets, intermittent fasting is emerging as a new lifestyle that you could embrace.

From being dismissed as a fad diet, it now emerges that intermittent fasting is backed by solid science. The alternate cycles of feeding and fasting can help one lose weight but also bring forth a host of health benefits, including better insulin sensitivity, reduced cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure levels.

The benefits of intermittent fasting goes way beyond the shedding of a few kilos, for it “unlocks cellular and molecular mechanisms and pathways in the body that leads to increased expression of antioxidant defences, DNA repair, protein quality control, mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy, and down-regulation of inflammation”, all of which leads to improved and robust organ functioning, says an article, Effects of Intermittent Fasting on Health, Ageing, and Disease in the December 26, 2019 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

These pathways are untapped or suppressed in persons who overeat and are sedentary, say authors, Mark P. Mattson and Rafael de Cabo, neuro scientists at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, U.S.

In combination with the right foods and physical activity, intermittent fasting is a legitimate lifestyle option that one can adopt, they say. Intermittent fasting is not about the restriction of any food groups but all about restricting your eating to a specific time window during the day, to achieve a fasting period of at least 12 to 16 hours.

Fasting cycle

The easiest way to do it would be to finish your last meal of the day at 7 or 8 p.m. By 8 a.m next day, you would have achieved 12 hours fasting. As your body get used to this time window, you could slowly extend it to 16 hours to get the true benefits of intermittent fasting. In short, you alternate between a 12 noon to 8 p.m. feeding period and an 8 p.m to 12 noon fasting period. One is allowed to have black coffee or green tea without sugar during the fasting period.

Ensure proper hydration and that one consumes enough fruits and vegetables. Another way of fasting would be to have a calorie-restricted meal twice in a week.

Glucose stored in the liver is the primary source of energy for the body. During fasting, once this source is exhausted, a metabolic shift occurs and the body starts using the fat (triglycerides) stored in adipose tissue for energy. The liver converts the triglycerides as ketones.

“Ketone bodies are not just fuel used during periods of fasting; they are potent signalling molecules with major effects on cell and organ functions. Ketone bodies regulate the expression and activity of many proteins and molecules which have profound implications for health, especially brain health and ageing,” writes Dr. Mattson.

From the evolutionary point also, human ancestors, who lived in forests, hunting and foraging for food, were used to the feeding and fasting cycles.

“Our routine of three solid meals a day is not a physiologic requirement but a mere habit enforced by the clock. Fasting helps the body utilise stored up fat for energy and also triggers physiological processes like autophagy (an important process of body repair and rejuvenation). Intermittent fasting, provided one eats right and not in calorie excess, is a most suitable way to shed excess body fat, which is the primary cause for many ailments,” says Sreejith N. Kumar, a physician who has been championing healthy eating.

Doctors’ advice

Those with diabetes or other health conditions should take up fasting only under a doctor’s advice and supervision, he says.

Safety, practicality, and sustainability of intermittent fasting is always questioned. Overnight results may not be there. Till one’s body get used to the new routine, one might feel hungry, irritated and tired at times. There might be people who binge eat during the feeding window. But most people settle down comfortably when benefits start accruing slowly.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/yortis/article30918408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25tvcma01-HEALTGER75QGB63jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-worthy-lifestyle-option/article30916362.ece

State Attorney K.A. Sohan submitted that the government proposed to give separate spaces on public places for political parties as well as advertisement agencies to erect their hoardings and advertisement boards. He further submitted that a committee had been constituted to formulate the plan.

He argued that penalty under the Land Conservancy Act for having erected hoardings and banners on public places could not be imposed. In fact, the Land Conservancy Act was not applicable to these places as they were under the control of local bodies and therefore, rules of local bodies could take care of such illegal erection of hoardings and flex boards.

The submission were made when a case relating to the removal of flex boards, banners and flags from public places came up for hearing before Justice Devan Ramachandran.

The court orally criticised the government for its proposal to provide space for advertisement boards as well as hoardings of political parties on public places. The court said that it never expected the government to take such stand. No individual or political parties should be allowed to erect hoardings or banners or flags on public places illegally. The court did not want to see pedestrians and motorists being hit or injured by collapsing hoardings. The government had not done anything to upend the menace posed by hoardings and advertisement boards.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/comprehensive-plan-to-deal-with-hoardings-govt-tells-hc/article30914804.ece
153,2020/02/25,Church takeover an uphill task for State,"HC has pull up District Collector for failure to implement the court order

The reluctance of the State machinery to take over the St. Thomas Church (Marthoman Cheriyapally) in Kothamangalam town and hand over its administration to the Orthodox faction of the Malankara church has mystified observers even as the Orthodox group has alleged lack of political will to act on the part of the government.

The Supreme Court verdict of July 2017 was categorical that no parallel administration of parishes would be allowed in the Malankara church. The court order was even applicable in the case of burial of the dead.

However, the State government has shown lack of willingness to move forward in the case of the Kothamangalam church even though other major and historically important churches have been take over and handed over to the Orthodox group. These churches include the St. Peter and Paul Church at Piravom; St. Mary’s church at Kolencherry; Chorakkuzhy St. Stephen’s church and the legendary St. George’s church at Kadamattam.

The church at Kothamangalam, where the saintly Eldho Mar Baselios is buried, has turned into a kind of embarrassment for the State even as the Kerala High Court pulled up the Ernakulam District Collector on Tuesday for failure to implement the court order.

It was widely held that a contempt of court petition for failure to carry out the Supreme Court order would not stand scrutiny. But Tuesday’s developments had proved that wrong, said Father Johns Abraham Konattu, official spokesman for the Orthodox group.

He alleged that the Jacobite group had whipped some false fears in the mind of the people about the consequences of a change of administration of the church. The importance of the church and the township would not change a bit when the administration of the church changed hands, Father Konattu said.

Social commentator A. Jayashankar said that though the Kothamangalam church was referred to as the “small church” in common parlance, it was a “big one” in terms of political consequences. There were around 3,000 parishioners and the Orthodox group constitute a miniscule minority. If the church was taken over by force, it would be reflected in the electoral politics in central Kerala, he said.

The Jacobite group has strongly opposed the take over of the church, while the Orthodox group has alleged that it had put together a group of people in the Kothamangalam town under the banner of Matha Maithri Samrakshana Samithi against the possible takeover. The Jacobite group said the samithi was a spontaneous reaction to fears of the church changing hands in terms of its administration.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/church-takeover-an-uphill-task-for-state/article30914762.ece
154,2020/02/25,"At NIV, it’s a sense of job well done","Major role in COVID-19 sample testing

The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) scare that gripped the State is gradually dying down. At the Kerala unit of the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Alappuzha, there is a sense of pride and contentment on the faces of scientists and technicians that comes from a job well done with minimal staff and facilities.

The Alappuzha unit has been among a small number of laboratories in the country — apart from the NIV, Pune, the apex laboratory — designated as State nodal laboratory for testing COVID-19. It has so far tested 458 samples collected from 411 individuals.

A.P. Sugunan, Scientist-G and Officer-in-Charge, NIV, Kerala, says capacity building at the NIV unit, a Biosafety Level (BSL) 2 laboratory, in a short span of time was a humongous challenge. “With the help of the NIV, Pune, we standardised the unit in three days and started testing samples from February 2. We created separate space and safety measures for processing samples from already known positive cases. During the Nipah outbreak, samples were tested at the NIV Kerala unit, but this time it was a different challenge altogether. The number of sample loads coming to the unit is considerably high compared to Nipah. This tested the efficacy of NIV Kerala for the very first time, since its inception a few years ago. However, we are able to rise to the occasion,” Dr. Sugunan says.

Capacity

They have created the capacity to test 100-150 samples a day. At the height of the scare, the unit had been receiving samples between 70 and 80 a day. It takes around seven hours for testing samples for the disease. In the face of the emergency, around 20 people, including scientists, technicians and other staff at the NIV, have been working round the clock in shifts for the last three weeks.

“We could not push samples arriving into storage as we had to send results within 24 hours. Our achievement can be attributed to teamwork and coordination,” Dr. Sugunan says, adding the number of samples has come down to around 20 in recent days. Equipping the unit for testing COVID-19 has helped identify negative cases in the State faster. However, it has been barred from disclosing positive results as aliquot of the samples need to be send to Pune for reconfirmation of positive cases.

The unit at Government Medical College Hospital, Alappuzha, will be shifted to Kuravanthodu once work on permanent building is completed.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/g3ked8/article30916748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26tvalNIV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/at-niv-it-is-a-sense-of-job-well-done/article30914726.ece
155,2020/02/25,Unrecognised schools under govt. radar,"Education Department to conduct verification from June

The Education Department is considering a proposal to conduct suo motu verification of unrecognised schools in the State from June this year.

The move comes amidst increasing complaints against the managements of unrecognised schools taking students and their parents for a ride. On Monday, 29 students of Arooja’s Little Stars School at Moolamkuzhi, near Fort Kochi, were restrained from appearing for the examination owing to the non-affiliation of the school with the CBSE.

“Based on a directive by the Kerala High Court in March last year, the Education Department has opened the window for unrecognised schools to submit applications for getting no-objection certificate from the State government as part of seeking the affiliation of central boards such as the CBSE and the ICSE. It will be closed on May 31. We plan to carry out an audit of unrecognised schools from June and initiate steps to close down such schools as per the due legal process and after resolving the concerns of the students and parents,” said senior officials close to the development.

NOC applications

As per official estimates, the managements of 800-odd schools had submitted the applications for obtaining NOC. Nearly 200 had been found eligible while many others have been given time to complete the mandatory conditions before May 31.

The mushrooming of unrecognised schools had peaked after the previous United Democratic Front regime and the present Left Democratic Front government failed to take a firm position on implementing the provision in the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act that stated that no elementary school (from Classes I to VIII) can function without the State government’s recognition.

Three-year time

A three-year time frame was given to unaided schools to obtain NOC when the Act was implemented in 2011. The deadline has been extended from time to time as the governments did not insist on complying with the provision on a compulsory basis.

The Act had also provisions for imposing penalty on such unrecognised schools after giving the managements a prescribed time for completing the formalities.

On the issue of Class X students of the Arooja’s school, Education Department officials said they can be permitted to appear for the SSLC exam starting on March 10 once they submit a written request.

“However, they will not be eligible for the 20% marks under the continuous evaluation process for students under the State board,” they said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/unrecognised-schools-under-govt-radar/article30914714.ece
156,2020/02/25,UDF aligning with extremists: CM,"Pinarayi says the front is having ties with Jamaat-e-Islami, SDPI

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has accused the United Democratic Front (UDF) of aligning with Left and right wing extremist organisations in its fight against the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the State.

Inaugurating a workshop organised by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] as a prelude to the local body elections here on Monday, Mr. Vijayan said that those who had been yearning to form a front of right wing forces against the LDF had emerged as the champions of the new formation.

The UDF that had been maintaining overt and covert links with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was now having ties with the Jamaat-e-Islami, SDPI and such other right wing parties. Prominent leaders of the UDF had addressed a protest organised by the Jamaat-e-Islami on Tuesday last. Leaders of the SDPI had also addressed the protest.

The UDF which was losing its ground was ready to cooperate with any communal and extremist elements. Supporting the Islamic theocratic State against Hindu theocracy being propounded by the RSS would only help the latter. Communalism could be countered only with secularism.

Neither the SDPI nor the Jamaat-e-Islami would have any role in the joint protest against such communalism. Now joint protests were being organised by keeping such elements at bay. A majority of the people in the State were strong votaries of secularism, he said.

Nokkukooli

Mr. Vijayan rued that the ‘nokkukooli’ system of headload workers charging hefty sums for loading and unloading goods was still prevalent in the State. Despite the government imposing a ban on the practice, isolated incidents were still being reported. This had come to the notice of the government. Stringent action would be taken against those involving in such practices, he said.

He said that complaints were still being raised about the functioning of local self-government institutions. A majority of the complaints were about the negative attitude towards those frequenting the local body offices for various services. He called for attitudinal change too.

CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, and other leaders were present. As many as 450 representatives comprising State and district committee members and area committee secretaries are attending the workshop.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/udf-aligning-with-extremists-cm/article30914700.ece
157,2020/02/25,Ernakulam Collector comes under HC fire,"Judge warns of action in Kothamangalam church case

The Kerala High Court on Tuesday slammed Ernakulam District Collector S. Suhas for not complying with the court order directing him to take over the Kothamangalam Marthoman Cheriyapally and hand it over to the vicar of the Orthodox faction in the Malankara Church.

Justice P. B. Suresh Kumar criticised the official when a petition seeking to initiate contempt of court proceedings against Mr. Suhas came up for hearing. When the court found that the Collector failed to appear before the court, it warned State Attorney K.A. Sohan that an arrest warrant would be issued against the Collector if he did not appear in person right then and there, following which the Collector turned up in half an hour.

The court told the Collector that he had simply ignored the court order, which amounted to ""an insult to the court"". If the orders of the court were not implemented, nobody would approach courts and the people would lose faith in the judiciary. This would ultimately lead to the failure of rule of law, the court orally observed.

Two options

The judge said the court now had two options: it can either put him behind bars or order some other forces to implement the order. The Collector then sought two more months to comply with the order saying that there would be law and order problems if the order was enforced. Besides, parishioners sitting inside the church would have to be convinced before giving effect to the order.

The court then said that it was a shame on the government that nothing had been done to implement the court order. It was really the might of some people that had been prevailing. It was now two months since the court had issued the directive. In fact, the court had to cut a sorry figure because of the non-implementation of the order.

The judge said he had received an anonymous letter threatening him for passing the order. The court later reserved its order in the case.

A Bench comprising Justice A.M. Shaffique and Justice Mary Joseph declined to entertain the appeal filed by the State government against the order on certain technical grounds. The court asked the government to file the appeal after making amends to it.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/6i8h5q/article30916727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03kikcgns01HCKGC06Q2CO83jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/collector-turns-up-in-hc-after-judge-warns-of-action/article30914494.ece
158,2020/02/25,NSS observes 50th death anniversary of Mannam,"Political leaders, delegates offer prayers, floral tributes at Perunna

The 50th death anniversary of Mannathu Padmanabhan, founder of the Nair Service Society (NSS), was observed at the organisation’s headquarters at Perunna on Tuesday.

Hundreds of delegates from different Karayogam units across the State queued up at the Mannam Samadhi here to offer floral tributes.

Senior Congress leader K.C. Joseph, Kerala Congress (M) leader C.F. Thomas and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State president K. Surendran were also among those who offered prayers.

NSS general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair and other key functionaries of the organisation including its president P.N. Narendranathan Nair were present.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Sukumaran Nair exhorted the community members to hold firm along the path laid out by Mannam. “The values that he upheld all his life are still socially relevant and have helped the NSS to grow as a premier social organisation overtime,” he noted.

CM’s message

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in a message posted on his official Facebook page on Tuesday, paid his tributes to Mannam on the occasion of his 50th death anniversary.

“The social reformation movement led by him has contributed immensely towards the evolution of Kerala. The efforts by the NSS under his leadership to keep the Manusmrithi-based custom at check is one of the key turning points in the history of the Travancore State,” the Chief Minister stated.

The statement also elaborated on the active role played by Mannam in the epic struggles against casteism at Vaikom and Guruvayoor and in ending the socially regressive practices that were endemic to the Nair community.

“Even those, who have differences of opinion with regard to his political engagements, can identify the impressive contributions by Mannam towards the creation of modern-day Kerala. The memories of this great social reformer will continue to stimulate the ongoing fight against regressive thoughts and social evils,” Mr. Vijayan said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nss-observes-50th-death-anniversary-of-mannam/article30914445.ece
159,2020/02/25,Rescheduling may hit deworming drive,"Tablet distribution postponed in Malappuram district

Repeated rescheduling of deworming tablet distribution for schoolchildren in successive years is likely to affect the efficacy of the drive, feels a section of the Health Department staff.

This year’s drive scheduled on Tuesday had to be postponed in Malappuram district following reports that substandard tablets were sent for distribution at some places.

Though there were similar reports from Kozhikode district too, the event was not deferred here. Around 3.5 lakh albendazole tablets manufactured by the Kerala State Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Ltd. had to be taken back.

Objective

According to the Union government, the objective of National Deworming Day is to deworm preschool and school-age children (enrolled and non-enrolled) in the 1-19 age group through schools and anganwadi centres to “improve their overall health, nutritional status, access to education and quality of life.”

The first round of distribution of albendazole anti-worm tablets is supposed to be held on February 10 each year, followed by a ‘mop-up’ exercise a week later to cover those left out. The second round is held in August similarly. However, Health Department sources point out that the drive is not being regularly held in Kerala since August 2018.

The campaign planned that month had to be postponed due to ‘technical reasons’ as the State was hit by the worst-ever floods during then. It was later held in December that year. Sources say that the de-worming exercise was not held in February 2019. The event could not be held on time in August 2019 too.

Drive postponed

The drive scheduled for February 10 this year had to be postponed to February 25 this time, again due to ‘technical reasons’.

In Malappuram district, it is postponed again after medical officers in one of the community health centres there noticed the substandard quality of the tablets.

Albendazole tablets in 400 mg belonging to batch number DK 0062 procured by the Kerala Medical Services Corporation Ltd. were asked to be withdrawn.

The Malappuram District Medical Officer reportedly issued a direction to take them back soon after. It has been reported that the same tablets in batches from DK 0058 to 0063 too had been distributed among educational institutions in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts.

The rescheduled date for tablet distribution in Malappuram district is expected to be announced later.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ukm5j3/article30916714.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26tv-pillscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rescheduling-may-hit-efficacy-of-tablet-distribution/article30914275.ece
160,2020/02/25,"After COVID threat, Kerala Tourism changing tack","Rethink on promoting the State in China

Kerala Tourism is gearing up to change the marketing strategy of the State’s tourism industry that has been rattled by the reporting of three COVID-19 cases in students who have returned from Wuhan in China. The move comes in the wake of massive cancellations in hotels and resorts across the State during February and March, following the reporting of COVID-19 cases and the declaration of the disease as ‘State disaster’ by the government.

Though no fresh cases has been reported and the government has withdrawn the State disaster status, the damage to the destination and the loss to the industry due to the cancellations are much more when compared to that caused by the Nipah virus.

The cancellations have affected all classes of hotels and resorts in the public and private sector. The declaration of State disaster has come in for flak from the captains of the industry. The marketing plan had to be reworked to gain the confidence of tourists and to convince them that the destination is safe.

Special emphasis on China, Europe, United States, and Australia and promotion of the destination using social media are the key elements in the ₹27-crore campaign of the Kerala Tourism rolled out internationally to woo tourists recently.

‘China Ready’

Kerala Tourism will now have to rethink on promoting the State in China, as Kerala is the first Indian State to be partnered for the China Ready programme. The State joined the initiative to attract tourists from China that sends 150 million tourists across the world annually. Of the 2 lakh-odd Chinese tourists visiting India annually, around 9,000 visit Kerala.

China is identified as a major market for Kerala Tourism this year. For wooing Chinese tourists, who are considered high spenders, it has been decided to create a website in the domain. China is rated one of the fastest growing markets of outbound tourists.

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran said the marketing strategy would be reworked in view of the fallout of COVID-19 cases. “Like in the case of Nipah virus and the floods that ravaged the State in 2018 and 2019, the Tourism Advisory Council will take a call on the strategy to be adopted to overcome the dip,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sng5ms/article30914089.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG9584,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/after-covid-threat-kerala-tourism-changing-tack/article30914090.ece
161,2020/02/25,"Kerala govt walks back on proposals for breweries, pubs and fewer dry days","The new liquor policy approved by the Cabinet gives fillip to traditional toddy sector; political compulsions seem to have driven Cabinet decision

The Kerala Government has walked back on a proposal to implement a relatively non-restrictive liquor policy in the State.

It had purportedly shelved the move at the last minute to dodge a possible backlash from church-backed prohibitionists and the Opposition.

Local body polls and Kuttanad Assembly by-election are on the cards this year.

Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in the country and liquor policy is a politically touchy issue.

The original proposal reportedly entailed sanctioning breweries and draught beer pubs.

The Government had also considered reducing the number of dry days and enhancing the timings of bars and beer parlours.

Its stated aim was to encourage global investors, create employment, enrich public coffers and reinvigorate the ailing tourism sector.

Boost to toddy sector

Instead, the Cabinet, which finalised the excise policy for the 2020-21 financial year on Tuesday, gave a fillip to the traditional toddy sector that employs thousands of workers who constitute the support base of the LDF.

The Government has legalised the sale of food through toddy shops. It has increased the upper limit of the legally permissible yield of coconut sap from a palm from 1.5 litres to 2 litres.

The offset of 200 m from places of worship, burial and educational institutions will not apply to buildings from which toddy parlours operate currently.

An estimated 5,071 toddy shops will go under the hammer for a lease period of three years soon. Current licences will get preference for a permit.

The Government has upped the liquor licence fee for private member clubs from ₹15 lakh to ₹20 lakh, and for bar hotels from ₹28 lakh to ₹30 lakh. Airport bar fee has been hiked from ₹1 lakh to ₹2 lakh.

There is no change in the conditions for grant of liquor licences. Three-star and above hotels continue to be eligible for bar licence.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had hinted that a less restrictive liquor policy would aid investment in the State.

However, compulsions of realpolitik appeared to have impelled him to shelve the proposals for now.

Several global majors had told the government that the lack of a late-night world of pubs and restaurants and other venues to socialise had hobbled its efforts to attract investment.

163,2020/02/25,VACB tells court Sivakumar’s benamis bought land,"May question him in amassment of wealth case

The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) has told a court here that it suspected that former Health Minister and Congress legislator V.S. Sivakumar had acquired properties in the name of other persons to park “ill-gotten” wealth out of the public eye and away from income tax assessors.

Mr. Sivakumar has since denied the charge as politically motivated. But, it did not stop the agency to accuse in court filings that a close associate of the politician acquired at least 13 plots during Mr. Sivakumar’s term in office between 2011-16.

The agency raided the residences of Mr. Sivakumar and that of persons suspected to be his “benamis” last week.

In a search report filed in the anti-corruption court here, the agency indicated that Mr. Sivakumar’s associates could also have used offshore accounts of non-resident Keralites to stash away unaccounted money.

The agency also said it had stumbled upon keys of bank lockers, which it would soon open in the presence of independent witnesses for examination. It had requested the bank to freeze the accounts of the suspects.

Prime properties

The agency said Mr. Sivakumar’s associate who had acquired the prime properties did so in rapid succession. He could not explain his source of wealth satisfactorily.

The agency was verifying whether there was any evasion of land tax. It had moved the Revenue Department to halt further transactions related to the properties.

Mr. Sivakumar had also held the Devaswom portfolio in the Oommen Chandy government. The VACB might re-examine at least a few corruption charges that had come up during that period to find out whether they had any bearing on its amassment of wealth case against the Congress leader.

The agency is planning to summon Mr. Sivakumar and his associates for questioning.

The Governor had allowed the agency to prosecute the former Minister. The disproportionate assets case against Mr. Sivakumar has come at a politically inconvenient time for the Congress, which is attempting to put the government on the defensive in the run-up to the local body polls and the by-election in Kuttanad.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vacb-tells-court-sivakumars-benamis-bought-land/article30907650.ece

The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has expressed its dissatisfaction with the raging factional feud in the Kerala Congress(M) and the Kerala Congress (Jacob).

It has told the Congress leadership that the dissension within these two constituents of the United Democratic Front (UDF) could spoil the chances of a coalition victory at the hustings.

The drumbeat for the local body polls, Kuttanad byelection, and the Assembly elections in 2021 is getting louder by the day.

The UDF required to act cohesively, present a united face to its workers, and pre-empt the infighting within parties from subverting election work. National general secretary of the IUML P.K. Kunhalikutty reportedly conveyed the message at meetings with Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran and Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Monday.

His visit on the eve of the UDF liaison committee meeting conveyed a sense of gravity. Mr. Kunhalikutty had the imprimatur of Panakkad Sayed Hyderali Shihab Thangal, chairman of the national political advisory committee of the IUML, for his political mission.

UDF meet today

The UDF meeting on Tuesday is unlikely to be a quiet affair. The KC(Jacob) has objected to Johnny Nellore attending the meeting in his capacity as secretary of the coalition.

Mr. Nellore had split the party and defected with his group to join the KC(M) chaired by P.J. Joseph.

165,2020/02/25,NOC in ivory case reaches Forest dept.,"No decision to withdraw case: Raju

Even as Forest Minister K. Raju asserted on Monday that no decision had been taken to withdraw the wildlife crime case booked against actor Mohanlal for illegal possession of ivory, a no-objection certificate (NOC) for withdrawing the case has reached the Forest Department.

Investigating officers in the case received the letter by post on Monday. Sources at the Home Department confirmed that copies of the NOC had been sent to the Ernakulam District Collector, Forest Headquarters, Divisional Forest Officer, Malayattoor, and the Assistant Public Prosecutor at the judicial first class magistrate court, Perumbavoor, where the trial is being held.

The Forest Headquarters had not received the letter, sources in the department said.

Mr. Raju told The Hindu on Monday that the opinion of the Law Department was sought on the issue. A decision on withdrawing the case would be taken in consultation with the Chief Minister. He said he was unaware of the NOC issued in the case. Those details would have to be sought from the Home Department.

The Hindu reported last week that the Home Department had issued a no-objection certificate to withdraw the case invoking Section 321 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The NOC was issued by the ‘L’ Department of the State Home Department, which had the powers for “withdrawal of prosecution cases in respect of all districts in the State”, according to the department website.

The NOC was issued after perusing a file forwarded from the Forest Department seeking legal opinion on the issue, the sources said.

166,2020/02/25,Malappuram sheds one more backward tag,"District has proved critics wrong with its progress in education

When it comes to education, especially in terms of facilities, Malappuram is no longer the most backward district in Malabar it was a couple of decades ago.

The educational achievements of the district have proved sceptics wrong. A spurt in the number of students passing the SSLC examination in Malappuram in the early years of the new millennium had raised eyebrows. Not any more.

The youth in Malappuram have proved over the past two decades that they are as good as anyone else in education. Through consistent performance, they proved that their triumphs had been through hard work.

When the Malappuram District Panchayat launched its ambitious education uplift project named Vijayabheri in 2001, the SSLC pass percentage in the district was an abysmal 33.24. Today, it rivals other districts.

Malappuram is not new to accomplishments on the learning front. Success of Project Akshaya has catapulted the district into the limelight. The project was launched in 2002 as an initiative to address the backwardness of the district. And, Malappuram was declared the first e-literate district in the country.

The awakening of the district witnessed in the secondary school level education should naturally impact its higher education firmament. In tune with the changing requirements and times, several institutions have come up in Malappuram in recent years. Apart from Calicut University and Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University, the district hosts one of the campuses of Aligarh Muslim University. Malappuram also boasts several professional colleges, including two medical colleges, a few dental colleges and half-a-dozen engineering colleges.

The educational growth of Malappuram students is apparent. It has its presence on campuses across the country.

The number of women from the district choosing campuses outside Kerala, and even foreign countries, has consistently risen over the last decade. Students from Malappuram are today studying in prestigious universities abroad, including Oxford and Cambridge.

Gone are the days when religious orthodoxy prevented people, especially women, from taking up higher education.

Orthodoxy

There was a time when religious orthodoxy proscribed people from studying English. But today, English is revered by groups which had once turned their back on it. Even native English speakers are appointed in some schools in Malappuram to improve the standard of English of students. Several students from poor economic backgrounds are pursuing higher education with the support of philanthropists in Malappuram. The change in people’s attitude towards education has been the main reason for this transformation. Parents in Malappuram have increasingly begun to believe that investment made in education is the best they can do for their children, and an investment of incalculable value.

She was speaking at the district-level adalat of the commission at the collectorate on Monday.

The commission has received around 30 complaints from job seekers against fraudulent agencies. Most candidates have got back their money following the intervention of the commission, Ms. Jerome said.

Of the 20 complaints, 11 were settled at the adalat. The remaining nine complaints will be reconsidered at the next adalat.

The commission sought a report from the Department of Public Instruction on a complaint that Malayalam was not being taught in 89 schools in the district.

168,2020/02/25,"Safety threat: PTA, students demand closure of quarry","Excess deposit of debris from mining area found near school

Students and Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) of Government Tribal LP School, Koombara, have approached the district administration and the Child Rights Commission, demanding the closure of a granite quarry near the institution. The demand comes in the wake of noticing excess deposit of soil and other debris from the mining area near the school.

Incidentally, a recent general body meeting of the PTA had decided to shift around 160 students from the school to safer locations in case of delayed action by the authorities. PTA representatives said the school, located near the quarrying area, was facing serious safety hazards, and that it would not be safe to send children to such a vulnerable place.

No inspection

The quarry, which had earlier been closed down following local protests, was reopened nearly three years ago.

According to PTA office-bearers, the safety threat faced by students was hardly taken into account while issuing No Objection Certificate (NOC) for its operation. They also alleged that no proper site inspection had been carried out by the authorities, including local panchayat and Revenue officials.

“We are helpless as the quarry operators are influential people. The Koodaranhi grama panchayat authorities are yet to respond to our complaints. If the authorities fail to act, we have no other go but to shift all children to another school,” said PTA president P.P. Ahammed Kutty. He added that copies of their petitions had already been mailed to 10 departments.

Mr. Ahammed Kutty said parents were not in a position to go for an indefinite agitation. “We want the district authorities to visit the spot, examine our complaints and take favourable action,” he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/yloqx3/article30907227.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25-KI-QUARRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/safety-threat-pta-students-demand-closure-of-quarry/article30907228.ece
169,2020/02/25,‘The Last Thing He Wanted’ review: Anne Hathaway deserves better than this,"Based on celebrated American writer Joan Didion’s eponymous book, this political thriller from Netflix should be given a hard miss

The biggest problem with The Last Thing He Wanted and really, the most basic, is that it is a challenge to know what is going on from the get-go. It doesn’t help that practically every character insists on speaking in jargon, innuendo or analogy every time they open their mouths.

Based on celebrated American writer Joan Didion’s eponymous book, the film opens with The Atlantic Post reporter Elena McMahon (Anne Hathaway) and photojournalist Alma Guerrero (Rosie Perez) coming across the aftermath of a massacre in Morazan Department, El Salvador, in 1982. Soon after Elena files her copy, the office in El Salvador is raided and she and Alma are forced to flee.

Cut to two years later and Elena is a political reporter, asking the Secretary of State uncomfortable questions about Nicaragua and Contra supporters.

The Last Thing He Wanted Cast: Anne Hathaway, Ben Affleck, Willem Dafoe, Rosie Perez, Edi Gathegi, Toby Jones

Director: Dee Rees

Storyline: A reporter becomes part of the story she is trying to break after agreeing to help her ailing father

Runtime: 1 hour 55 minutes

Elena tells her daughter Cat, who is at boarding school, that she is hoping to get a job at the Central American bureau but then is given the bad news that instead of moving closer to the action, she will have to cover Reagan’s reelection campaign. While still following up on the arms story she has been working on, her father, Dick (Willem Dafoe) suddenly shows up. Initially in great spirits as he has an arms deal to complete with a payout so good that it’s his ticket out, Dick’s ebullience soon turns to panic after he is admitted at the hospital. And so he asks Elena to fill in for him.

Now, if you think this is the part where the film goes into high-octane mode, you would be wrong. Instead it becomes even more incomprehensible, particularly with Elena’s choices. She appears to trust everyone and yet no one.

While she is brokering the deal and getting paid for the ammunition in cocaine instead of money, the politicians in Washington have been thinking over how she can serve their interests, specifically Treat Morrison, “the man on the spot in the world’s hottest spots”, played by Ben Affleck.

The film is mainly a vehicle for Anne Hathaway who turns in a predictably solid performance playing the “unafraid and over-driven” Elena. It’s just too bad that she isn’t in a better film.

Stray thoughts

While eating that most American of desserts, apple pie with ice-cream, the Secretary of State gives an analogy on three of them eating the same dish. However, he tells Treat Morrison, who is using a fork, to use a spoon. “Scrape down the sides, no remainders. Nothing missed.” Sir, a fork will work just as well. (Except when having soup, of course.)

Sure, the desk will correct it, but shouldn’t Alma know the difference between ‘its’ and ‘it’s’? And while on the subject, shouldn’t Elena have said ‘beat the effect’ and not ‘affect’?",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/5cbskc/article30913081.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/the-last-thing-he-wanted-trailer,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-last-thing-he-wanted-review-anne-hathaway-deserves-better-than-this/article30913082.ece

171,2020/02/25,"Ahead of BIFFes, Bangalore’s filmmakers talk about the relevance of film festivals","In this age of streaming platforms, will festivals lose their relevance?

Film festivals, especially over the last decade, have been mushrooming across India. A census is difficult and unavailable as many of them are either irregular or nonrecurrent. But in all four corners of the country, there is at least one to sate the appetite of film enthusiasts for world cinema. In the ‘70s and ‘ 80s, however, this wasn’t the case. There was only one major festival, the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), which travelled to several cities. Some of these cities also had fledgling film societies that screened international cinema. To watch and celebrate cinema, people from other parts of the country had to travel to these places. Only a few would, regularly. One of them was Kamal Haasan.

“I used to run towards every place that had a film festival. Some of the best films I have seen was in Bangalore,” he recounted whilst inaugurating the sixth edition of Bangalore International Film Festival in 2013. As with IT, he’d said, the city can become a centre for international cinema.

Bengaluru, which had a budding cinema community since the ‘70s, hosted IFFI in 1980 and 1992. It started its own international festival two years after Goa was fixed as a permanent venue for IFFI in 2004. Some cities, like Chennai, already had their own festivals by then.

How film festivals help filmmakers? Roopa Rao: It helps a lot, especially for indie filmmakers. If at all we get an award, it helps to promote the film. And, usually, the festival audience are the first to see the film (before the theatrical release). So, we get an idea of how people will react to the film.

Girish Kasaravalli: When you watch films from Iran or Poland, you get to know the mood of that country. You get to know different perspectives. And, it is a way of exchanging ideas. You can also get to see how the idiom of cinema is changing year after year.

You can also get to see how the idiom of cinema is changing year after year. Mansore: I learnt a lot of things. How movies don’t have a theory. How budget doesn’t matter but subject does. How you don’t always need a hero and a heroine to tell a story. The narrative techniques and the realism from my movies were learnt from the festival.

The narrative techniques and the realism from my movies were learnt from the festival. B Suresh: When you watch a film like Jallikattu or Ee Ma Yau or Kumbalangi Nights, you tend to imbibe certain things from the film. When you make the film, you try to do the same thing. It could be a copy, it could be an inspiration or it could just be a technique that you are trying to emulate.

The first edition of Suchitra Bangalore International Film Festival, was held during December 22-28 in 2006 in collaboration with Suchitra Film Society, which, started in 1971, is among the country’s oldest film clubs that are active. About 20 film personalities — Indian and international — attended the event, wherein 35 films were presented in three screens.

The 12th edition of the festival, now called the Bangalore International Film Festival (BIFFes) and organised by Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy, will be held from February 26 to March 4.

“The event has grown incrementally over the years,” says N Vidyashankar, the artistic director of BIFFes. This year will have over 600 film personalities and a footfall of over a lakh. Over 200 films will be shown in 14 screens across four venues.

Film festivals have their own charm. For instance, Roopa Rao, who made the critically acclaimed Gantumoote, recalls a visit to IFFI in Goa 16 years ago, where her dream to be a filmmaker was sown. “I was not even actively pursuing filmmaking then. But I just saw the posters and the lights and I remember telling myself that I would come back here as a filmmaker… which I did.” Roopa, 38, however, says festivals weren’t a major source of learning for her. “Internet and torrents happened,” she says, in the last 10 years.

Relevance of festivals

Even a star like Kamal Haasan had to forage for international films. In this age of streaming platforms, accessibility isn’t a problem. So, will the relevance of festivals diminish?

But there are at least three reasons why festivals are still significant.

One: as filmmaker and president of Suchitra Film Society, B Suresh says, “Most of these streaming platforms don’t have arthouse cinema from, say, Congo or Ethiopia. They don’t have political content — like cinema that caters to women’s issues. They mostly sell content that have sex, crime and violence.”

Two: festivals aren’t just about screenings; at least the big ones are a confluence of filmmakers, where ideas get exchanged. “You get to meet people from all over the world. You get to know their process of making the film, how they raise funds. Sometimes knowing their difficulties can help us find our path,” says Suresh.

Three: festivals are also a platform for makers to know more about their industry. For instance, the upcoming edition of BIFFes features a Film Bazaar, which includes interactive sessions on crafting web series, AI in filmmaking among other things.

Mindset for a festival

Girish Kasaravalli, one of the pioneers of parallel cinema in India, is a regular at BIFFes. On how much a festival can impact the region’s film industry, he says, “Festivals are just a platform; it all depends on how people make use of it.”

Kasaravalli reckons a film festival shouldn’t be attended with the mindset of going for a Friday release. He calls for seriousness. “Some people come to the festival to pass time. It is not just about watching movies. A film festival is a cultural activity. On a given day, you have to choose between 10 or 11 movies to watch. So, you have to do a lot of background research. While entering a movie, you should know who the film’s director, its contemporary relevance, its reviews… these things matter.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dbcxgj/article30911699.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIFFESCROWD,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bangalore-international-film-festival-relevance-of-film-festivals-in-the-age-of-streaming-platforms/article30911700.ece
172,2020/02/25,"Kamal Haasan calls for safety audit of sets, asks about steps taken to ensure safety on ‘Indian 2’ sets","In a letter to Lyca Productions Chairman and Founder A. Subhaskaran, the actor-politician questioned the steps taken by the production team following an accident during the shoot

In a letter to Lyca Productions Chairman and Founder A. Subhaskaran, actor Kamal Haasan questioned the steps taken by the production team to ensure the safety of the artists, crew and other technicians involved in the shoot and the insurance that the production team has taken.

The letter, dated February 22, was sent following an accident on the sets of Indian 2 where a crane used during the shoot came crashing down, killing three technicians and inuring a few others.

“Any loss, cost damage, risk undergone on account of the production team failing to carry out what they ought to have carried out has to be compensated in full and at the earliest,” Mr Haasan said, in the letter.

He further stated that as producers, Lyca should ensure the best of medical help to each of those who have been admitted and provide the affected families with both financial and emotional support.

Mr Haasan said that he was just a few seconds and a few meters away from the spot where the mishap occurred and miraculously escaped joining the list of fatalities.

Stating that he could hardly express his trauma and agony in words, the actor said that the ability to compensate should never be equated to their sense of responsibility.

“With so many human lives involved in a shoot, the paramount importance for the production is to ensure safety of the people involved. Accidents of this kind only destroy the confidence and belief of the entire team, in the production team,” he said.

Mr Haasan further called for a safety audit to be conducted and diligence to be followed which will then give the cast and crew confidence to return to the shoot.

“You should implement all guidelines on safety and institute an audit process to assess safety standards at shoot locations before the commencement of any shoot. Only by such positive and proactive steps- the production team can demonstrate its diligence in adhering to safety requirements and thereby restore the confidence of the cast and crew(including me) to report back for shoot,” the letter read.

Following the accident, Mr Haasan had announced a compensation of Rs 1 crore for the families of the deceased and the technicians who had been injured. Lyca Productions too had announced a compensation of Rs 2 crore and said that they would bear the medical expenses.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/l7ygf5/article30911607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI4302018000164B,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kamal-haasan-calls-for-safety-audit-of-sets-asks-about-steps-taken-to-ensure-safety-on-indian-2-sets/article30911608.ece

Earlier known for her role as Sasha on The Walking Dead, life changed dramatically for Sonequa Martin-Green in 2017 when she was cast as the first black female lead in a Star Trek series. Headlining Star Trek: Discovery as Michael Burnham, Sonequa has since endeared to millions of fans across the world with her interpretation of the coveted role, as well as the show that has broken new ground constantly.

2020 promises to be a big year for the actor, as apart from her television role, she also starts filming for the much-anticipated sequel to Space Jam, the live-action animation film, in which she will share screen space with LeBron James and Don Cheadle.

Two seasons into Discovery and preparing for the next, Sonequa is fully aware now of not just the responsibilities that come with being part of an iconic franchise like Star Trek, but also the impact it has had on her career.

“Yes, from the beginning, the creators have always been really progressive, ensuring that the series focussed on diversity and constant innovation. Every Star Trek has had that concept at its core, as we are obviously catering to a massive fan base. There’s so much respect I have for the writers and directors, as they want the show to reflect society, as well as use the potential of the franchise in the right manner,” she begins.

Discovery has become more complex as the show has progressed in terms of sci-fi references on the show, technical plot points and so on. With an ardent following that will not forgive the slightest of logical loopholes or discrepancies, actors have to be on point with their understanding of the storylines, however intricate they may be — something that Sonequa acknowledges ardently: “Be it quantum physics or wormholes or time crystals, I’m always doing my research to satisfy my curiosity. It’s important for me, as an actor, to have at least an idea of everything my character knows and talks about on the show. This essentially means that I’m Googling all these terms and concepts on the Internet when we get our scripts, until the time when I can’t process anything more!” (laughs)

While the response to the first two seasons have been largely positive, it goes without saying that there will always be the ‘purists’ who criticise some part of the enterprise... how does she deal with that?

“We were clear from the beginning that our show was going to keep the legacy of Star Trek alight, but definitely have its own clear identity. Fans have strong opinions purely because of their love for the franchise, and their feedback comes from a place of pure passion as they hold it so close to their hearts. We want them to keep feeling this way, and we take it all in our stride. But at the same time, we have understood that while it may be difficult to accept, the right changes are accepted wholeheartedly,” she quips.

One of the funniest and weirdest moments on the show happened with Sonequa’s real-life husband (Kenric Green) played her father! Looking back at the moment, the actor laughs, “It was actually such a hoot for both of us! Even though he was on the show only for a little bit, now I can always say that my husband is my dad (laughs). When the opportunity came our way, we loved it and didn’t have to think twice about going ahead with it.”

With production of the next Star Trek: Discovery season underway, Sonequa, who can’t reveal much about where her character is headed towards, signs off saying that she’s always “trying to find a balance” and responds to a last query on if she is aware of Discovery’s fandom in India.

“We love India! The culture, the fans, the ideology of the viewers is something I’m absolutely fascinated by. It’d be my dream to visit someday,” she concludes.

174,2020/02/25,Prataya Saha’s ‘The Good Wife’ is an emotional roller coaster,"The 18-minute film, which premièred at the Chennai International Short Film Festival, has won multiple awards at film festivals

“From watching three-hour-long feature films, we have now switched to watching movies that are under 75 minutes. The attention span of the audiences is gradually reducing and with the access to smart phones, the future is short films,” says Prataya Saha, an independent filmmaker based out of Bengaluru. His 18-minute film, The Good Wife, which premièred at the Chennai International Short Film Festival, has won multiple awards at film festivals — both nationally and internationally, in the past few months.

“The journey so far has been encouraging, and I am surprised that the film touched the hearts of the audiences in the international circuit, despite its clichéd theme. Looking back, I think the theme struck a chord irrespective of geographical barriers and cultures,” he says.

The Good Wife, explores the emotions of a married woman, and by casting established theatre artist Anshulika Kapoor, the director has ensured that the varied state of mind of the protagonist is conveyed beautifully. The narrative tricks us to believe that the length of the film is much more than it really is. “Each shot was not more than 10 seconds, but the overall effect is such that you get the feeling of having witnessed a day in the life of the protagonist, who goes through myraid emotions,” the director says.

Prataya says that the marital issues faced by his family during his growing up years in Kolkata in the ’90s became the base for The Good Wife. “Marriage structure has changed in the past 25 years, at least in the metros. My idea was to visually transport the audiences to a particular timeline 25 years ago. Which is why the film is set in the ’90s,” he explains. Considering its runtime, the film’s strong points are sound design and cinematography.

The director says that it took over a year to complete the movie and it has been travelling to various film festivals for the past seven months.

Of the six Members of Parliament (MP) who were elected in 2014, four were from the AIADMK and one each from the DMK and the Communist Party of India (Marxist).

Last year, both the DMK and the AIADMK had given one seat from their quota to the Marumarlachi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) and the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK)

Those who are retiring now are Vijila Sathyananth, K. Selvaraj and S. Muthukaruppan belonging to the AIADMK; Tiruchi Siva (DMK) and T.K.

Mr. Rangarajan has served two terms in the Rajya Sabha.

According to the schedule released by the EC, nominations can be filed during March 6-13. They will be scrutinised on March 16 with the last date for withdrawal of nominations being March 18. If required, polling will take place between 9 am and 4 pm on March 26.

176,2020/02/25,Fishers in Tamil Nadu demand primary cooperative bank,"The Indian Fishermen Association and other associations say banks do not give out loans to fishermen or ask for collateral that cannot be provided

Fishers have been demanding a primary cooperative bank for themselves -- on the lines of the primary agricultural banks used by farmers.

“Though the Central government has agreed to give us Kisan Credit Cards, no bank is agreeing to provide us with loans. They are all asking us for collateral, or details of previous loans taken and repaid. Fishers live in coastal poromoboke lands and do not have pattas: what property can we pledge,” asks Nanjil Ravi of the Akhila India Meenavar Sangam.

M.D. Dayalan of the Indian Fishermen Association said the Reserve Bank of India’s norms stipulate that banks should not ask for surety or property collateral for loans of up to ₹10 lakh. But every bank in the coastal areas in the State ask for these things. “The children of fishers don’t even get educational loans. Only managers who understand the situation and personally know the fisher agree to provide loans. And these are very few and far between,” he said.

Joyce Victoria, the association’s secretary, explained that in neighbouring Kerala, village-level banks provide loans to fishers based on the recommendation of associations that are recognised by the State government. “Members of an association can avail of loans. Say, for instance, if the member owns a boat and is in need of a loan, the association would recommend it and the bank gives the loan. The repayment happens through the sale of fish. The bank becomes the owner of the fish, it pays the salaries of labourers, the owner and even transfers payments to the ice factory and diesel pump,” she said.

A retired official of the Fisheries department said that the bank had been a long-pending demand of fishers. “There is a lot of money belonging to fishers in primary agricultural banks, if that is moved to fishermen’s cooperative banks, it would help. The Kisan credit cards meant for fishers could be routed through these banks. In Colachel, the local fishermen’s cooperative society gives jewel loans,” he pointed out.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/fishers-in-tamil-nadu-demand-primary-cooperative-bank/article30910889.ece
177,2020/02/25,Orders reserved on govt. doctors’ petitions,"Issue relates to transfers in wake of stir

The Madras High Court has reserved its orders on a batch of writ petitions filed by government doctors who were subjected to inter-district transfers after members of Federation of Government Doctors’ Association (FOGDA) resorted to a strike between October 25 and November 1, last year, pressing various demands including pay hike.

Justice N. Anand Venkatesh deferred his verdict after the government filed an additional affidavit claiming that there was no bar in law to shift the doctors between the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine (DPH), Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services (DMRHS) and Directorate of Medical Education (DME).

In the additional affidavit filed through Advocate General Vijay Narayan, the government assured the court the pay structure of the government doctors would be well protected despite being subjected to transfer from one Directorate to another and that their Civil Medical List (CML) seniority would also be maintained without any change.

‘A case of victimisation’

However, advocates C. Kanagaraj and M. Jothimani, representing the doctors, argued that the transfer orders must be quashed on the solitary ground that the en masse transfers were nothing but victimisation and that the action of the government smacked of arbitrariness and mala fide intention couched in the garb of an administrative decision.

They pointed out that the government had not spared even specialist doctors from being transferred to remote stations. The court was told that a cardiothoracic surgeon in the rank of a professor and who was heading the relevant department at a government hospital in Salem, had been transferred to Udhagamanadalam.

On its part, the government contended that it had to take the extreme step of transferring the government doctors to bring in normalcy and ensure that health care services to the poor and the needy were not affected. It informed the court that members of Tamil Nadu Medical Services were liable to be transferred to any part of the State.

Though doctors from DME had been transferred to DMS, they could participate in the inter directorate transfer counselling in the future and get back to the DME based on their qualifications and seniority as per the rules in force at that relevant point of time. It was not as if they would have to work under DMS forever, the government said.

“If the petitioners either return to DME through inter directorate counselling conducted by DME or if they prefer to stay in DMS, their career progression is well protected by person-oriented promotion,” the additional affidavit filed by S. Gurunathan, Director of Medical and Rural Health Services, on behalf of himself as well as the government, read.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/orders-reserved-on-govt-doctors-petitions/article30907875.ece
178,2020/02/25,Retrieving the dead from railway tracks,"Kali has been aiding Railway Police in the task for the past 25 years

Kalimuthu, or Kali, as he is known to his friends, can be found sleeping outside a closed shop on West Perumal Maistry Street, less than a kilometre away from the Madurai Railway Junction. On days when bodies need to be retrieved from the tracks, personnel of the Government Railway Police come looking for him.

“They say, ‘Dei Kali, seekram vaadaa. Ponam kedaku (Hey Kali, come quickly. There is a corpse lying)’. I accompany them, carry the stretcher from there, and begin my job,” Mr. Kali says.

For the past 25 years, he has been carrying parts of mangled bodies found lying on train tracks on stretchers, zipping them, and taking them on a tricycle to the Government Rajaji Hospital’s mortuary. He is now 67 years old and has poor eyesight and a weak body. But he still waits for the ‘Dei Kali’ call as he is paid handsomely for the job.

Mr. Kali says that before he began picking bodies off the tracks, he was a cycle-rickshaw driver. The advent of motorised transport meant dwindling income, and he was desperately looking for another job to earn some money.

“Word spread through a network that exists around the Meenakshi temple, and the police came to me and asked me if I would pick a body up late at night,” he recalls.

On the job, he says he has learnt to always remove his shirt, drink enough alcohol to withstand the stench of the corpse, carry the body on his shoulder and wear slippers.

“I have some simple techniques. The bloodstains on my shirt usually do not go away even after washing because I do not have any powerful detergents or a washing stone as I don’t have a home. It is easier to work without a shirt. I also make it a point to wear my slippers because the stones on the tracks can cause us to trip. We ourselves could then become victims of accidents,” he says.

Severed body parts

Mr. Kali says he brings back bodies by himself during the day, but is accompanied by two policemen carrying torches at night.

“They will point to the severed body parts and guide me. I have never been afraid during the job and have largely been truthful. I have never stolen a single piece of jewellery from the dead,” he says.

For 25 years, the price offered for retrieving a body has ranged from ₹200 to ₹500. He has to return from the morgue, clean the stretcher and then get his payment, he says. He adds that members of the police force have been particularly kind to him — by giving him some “extra money” when he is unwell or picking out shirts for festivals.

“The last time he picked up a body was three months ago. But sometimes, he comes to the station for an extra hundred [rupees]. Because of our long association, we do not mind giving him some cash here and there,” says a Government Railway Police staff.

Except for the purpose of survival, Mr. Kali says he is not attracted to the concept of money.

“I do not see myself as a saint or someone who has done a big service. For me, the job has just been about earning enough to buy enough food and alcohol to get through the rest of my days. I have carried bodies of rich mill owners and beggars. One day, someone will carry my body off the street, too. Nothing strange,” he says.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/btkerx/article30907862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25MA25KALIMUTHU2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/retrieving-the-dead-from-tracks/article30907863.ece
179,2020/02/25,"CBI books NGO, school for FCRA violations","‘Caruna Bal Vikas used foreign funds for religious activities’

The Central Bureau of Investigation has booked Tamil Nadu-based Caruna Bal Vikas (CBV), Adhane Management Consultants, Bentinck Higher Secondary School and others for alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).

The case was registered on a complaint from the Home Ministry’s FCRA wing, which alleges that CBV, an NGO, used a part of the foreign receipts for religious activities. It had received funds from Compassion International-USA during the check period.

“Further, CBV has, inter alia, declared its long-term objective of “converting poor children into fulfilled Christian adults”, and thus engaged in religious activities, including conversions to Christianity. Such activities have potential to disturb communal harmony and, therefore, are in violation of the Section 12(4)(f)(vi) of the FCRA, 2010,” the FIR alleges.

As per the I-T Department report, the FIR mentions, CBV used only 10% of foreign contributions for the stated purposes, and diverted the remaining to 300 NGOs in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and other States. Some NGOs were not FCRA registered.

CBV allegedly transferred about ₹1 crore to non-FCRA registered Bentinck High Secondary School in 2011-14.

The I-T Department report “also mentions diversion of funds for conversion activities to NGOs owing allegiance to the Methodist Church, Baptist Church, Salvation Army, Christian Missionary Society and Indian Pentecostal Church, which is in violation of its charter of service to children”.

After CBV came under the Income-Tax Department’s scanner in 2013, it is alleged that Adhane Management Consultants was set up in July 2014 “to mislead the authorities”. The CEO of CBV and the company and their directors were the same. The two entities shared the same registered address in Chennai’s Anna Nagar East.

After the company was registered, the funding from Compassion International-USA, which was earlier channelled through CBV, was shifted almost entirely to it.

CBV received ₹6.75 crore in 2014-15, as against ₹109.50 crore in 2011-12, ₹130.52 crore in 2012-13 and ₹111.71 crore in 2013-14. The company got ₹6.75 crore in foreign contribution from Compassion International-USA allegedly without prior permission.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cbi-books-ngo-school-for-fcra-violations/article30907846.ece
180,2020/02/25,HC raps bank managers for harassing customer,"Petitioner who lost credit card denied zero loss liability

The Madras High Court has come down heavily on two managers of Axis Bank Limited for their “retrograde bureaucracy” while dealing with a customer who lost his credit card during a business trip to Paris in October 2018 and imposed costs of ₹10,000 to make them realise the agony and damage they had caused the customer.

After ordering that the cost amount be paid to the Dean of Stanley Medical College Hospital here for treatment of the poor, Justice C.V. Karthikeyan wrote: “It is hoped that at least now they would realise that they survive only on confidence and trust placed by customers and not on the regrettable attitude of their staff/officers.”

The judge appreciated Chevanan Mohan, counsel for Reserve Bank of India (RBI), for having stepped in at the right moment to find out that it was the managers who were at fault by not according the benefit of zero loss liability, up to ₹3 lakh, to which the customer was entitled to as per conditions of the platinum Visa card issued to him. He pointed out that the writ petitioner N. Santhosh Kumar had lost his wallet containing four credit cards issued by Citi Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank, in Paris on October 1, 2018. The petitioner lodged a police complaint over there and informed all the four banks within three days as per the RBI regulations.

Thereafter, within 30 days, he provided documents such as a copy of the complaint, copies of his passport reflecting his travel to the foreign country and also the entire itinerary. Three out of the four banks promptly accepted the documents and Citibank reimbursed the entire money spent by unknown third parties using the lost card.

Petitioner blacklisted

The Kodambakkam branch manager of Axis Bank and the manager of its credit cards division alone refused to waive around ₹ 1.67 lakh and it led to the petitioner getting blacklisted by Credit Information Bureau India Limited (CIBIL) from being eligible to obtain any kind of loan from any bank or financial institution in the country.

The petitioner claimed to have been harassed by bank officials by sending numerous e-mails, text messages, voice calls and even recovery agents to his house demanding payment of money, but the bank managers denied the allegations in a counter affidavit filed on behalf of them before the court.

They claimed that the petitioner was solely responsible for the security of the card and that Axis Bank Limited was not liable for loss or damage arising out of the negligence of the customer.

However, the RBI on its part told the court that the customer was eligible to get the disputed transactions reversed and that it had instructed the bank to do so.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-raps-bank-managers-for-harassing-customer/article30907791.ece
181,2020/02/25,"‘Why not single window nod for NHAI projects?’, Madras HC asks State govt.","HC suo motu includes Chief Secretary as party to PIL plea

The Madras High Court on Monday embarked on an exercise to ascertain the possibility of the State government establishing a single window system for National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to obtain clearances from multiple departments such as the Public Works, the State Highways and the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments either while laying new highways or when widening the existing highways.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha included the Chief Secretary as one of the respondents to a suo motu public interest litigation petition taken up by the court regarding poor maintenance of the national highway between Maduravoyal and Wallajahpet. It sought to know his response by March 8. The judges also directed the NHAI to ensure that the highway in question was maintained well with sufficient lights.

In case of road accidents either due to poor condition of the highway or bad lighting, the court would consider making the NHAI also liable to compensate the victims, the judges warned.

Earlier, Assistant Solicitor General G. Karthikeyan submitted a report stating that the NHAI had carried out pothole and patch repair work on the entire stretch in order to maintain the national highway in a motorable condition.

On a court-appointed Advocate Commissioner having found that there was no adequate lighting on the highway, the report, filed by Project Director P.T. Mohan, stated that high-mast lighting would be provided at toll plaza locations and major junctions during the six-laning of Sriperumbudur to Karaipettai (17 junctions) and Karaipettai to Wallajahpet (34 junctions). Street lights would be provided in built-up areas, flyovers and underpasses, it added. The report said that a proposal for ₹ 14.09 crore had been submitted for providing lighting facilities between Maduravoyal and Sriperumbudur.

The Advocate Commissioner brought it to the notice of the court the absence of a strong median on the highway. Responding to this, the Project Director said that a concrete median would be provided shortly and that sufficient number of highway patrol vehicles and ambulances had been deployed.

Pointing out that its contractors had achieved only 2.4% and 5.8%, as against the intended target of 15.47% and 31.95% with respect to six-laning of Sriperumbudur to Karaipettai and Karaipettai to Wallajahpet sections respectively as on January 31 this year, the court was told that delay in obtaining approvals for shifting electric poles, water pipelines, temples and such other public utilities was causing considerable delay in completing the project.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/3pus5l/article30907773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25MADRASHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/why-not-single-window-nod-for-nhai-projects-madras-hc-asks-state-govt/article30907774.ece
182,2020/02/25,Residents protest move to set up sewage treatment plant,"People gather at municipal office in Ambur and submit petition

A group of residents from A-Kasba in Ambur Municipality turned up at the municipal office in Ambur on Monday to protest what they call the move to set up a sewage treatment plant in their area.

Around 150 residents gathered and said that a group of municipal officials walked into the plot, adjoining Palar River last week, in which they have proposed to construct a sewage treatment plant and began assessing it.

Ever since the Ambur Municipality has initiated the ₹165.55-crore underground drainage (UGD) project, it started running into rough weather in the form of protests and agitations.

On Monday, residents who gathered in front of the Municipal office wanted to meet the Commissioner to apprise him of their apprehensions over the construction of the sewage plant on the banks of Palar river.

Residents said that the plant would not only affect the environment, if the pollution from the proposed sewage treatment plant was not kept under check, but would also contaminate the groundwater in the entire vicinity.

“We are afraid that we will have to bear the stench of sewage emanating from that site,” he said.

Up in arms

The residents said the municipality had recently announced the setting up of a sewage pumping station. “Most areas would not allow the pumping station to be set up because once allowed sewage from other areas also will flow into our area,” said Khan. “It will make our vicinity unhygienic and filled with stench,” he said. “The officials are not giving us any assurance on the noise as well as air pollution and even if they assure us, how can we take them into confidence, as the previous experiences stand testimony to the negative impact of such plants on the environment,” he said.

After insistence by the agitating public, Commissioner Soundararajan came out of the office and received the petition from the residents. Municipal Engineer L. Kumar and Sanitary Officer Baskar were present.

Residents said they would wait for the action to be taken by the municipal commissioner. They said they would intensify their stir if their request to shift the site of sewage treatment plant was not paid heed to.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/u72quy/article30907718.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ambur-Residents-protest-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/residents-protest-move-to-set-up-sewage-treatment-plant/article30907719.ece

184,2020/02/25,South-bound buses begin operation from old bus stand,"Arrangement will decongest new bus stand: officials

Buses including those operated by private bus owners towards Villupuram, Tiruvannamalai, Polur and Arni began operations from the old bus terminus in Vellore from Sunday. Hitherto these buses were operated from the new bus stand.

The Vellore Municipal Corporation officials said that this move would decongest the new bus stand and around 180 buses would ply to southern destinations like Kumbakonam, Thanjavur, Madurai, Tiruchi, Tirunelveli, Kanyakumari.

Apart from this, town buses towards Anaikattu, Odugathur, Padavedu, will be operated from the old bus stand as usual. Similarly, town buses towards Latheri, KV Kuppam, Gudiyatham, Pernambut, Katpadi, Thiruvalam, Arcot and Walajah will be operated from the old bus stand.

Commuters demanded that buses be parked at the designated bus bays. More signages to identify the buses and ‘an audible’ public address system on both sides of the old bus stand are the need of the hour. Despite being the oldest bus stand, there is a stench always on the premises, which needs to be addressed, said S.Rupavani, a college student. Poor sanitary conditions prevail in both bus stands and the officials blame the ‘commuters’ lack of awareness’, she pointed out. Instead of blaming the commuters, who are from rural pockets, the Vellore Corporation should ensure the public convenience with water facility and sincere attendants, she said.

An official from the Vellore Corporation said that bus bays are being cleared to ensure parking of buses at designated slots in old bus stand. He added that buses towards Chennai, Bengaluru, Kancheepuram, Tirupattur are being operated from new bus stand. Buses to Chittoor, Tirupathi are also being operated from the new bus stand. He said that small issues would crop up while executing major works such as this one and these issues would be attended to, “whenever things are brought to our notice”.

The official added that the new bus stand is being reconstructed at a cost of ₹46.51 crore on a 9.25-acre area, under the Smart City scheme by the Vellore Municipal Corporation.

The work would be completed in 24 months and the facility would become operational by January 2022.

The new bus stand, will have all required facilities, including 65 active bus bays and 11 idle bus bays, and 8 bays earmarked for city buses.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5orv52/article30907686.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THBUSES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/south-bound-buses-begin-operation-from-old-bus-stand/article30907687.ece

186,2020/02/25,Officials evict shops in terminus to free space for buses,"Move aims to facilitate operation of more buses

Several shops inside the old bus terminus on Anna Salai in Vellore were removed by the officials of Vellore Municipal Corporation on Monday. This move has been initiated to facilitate operation of more buses bound for Tiruvannamalai, Tiruchi, Mayiladuthurai, Madurai from the old bus terminus.

Officials removed petty shops. They claimed that these shops were encroaching upon bus bays and waiting space thus forcing the commuters to wait in the carriageway. Several complaints were raised by commuters about the poor status of the facility where they were left to brave the hot sun and downpour.

A team of officials led by Assistant Commissioner N. Mathivanan, Vellore Municipal Corporation, removed the shops. It would be beneficial to the commuters as well as bus operators including that of government buses, the officials said.

However, the shopkeepers still rule the bus terminus. They take over the space at will. Adding to that two wheelers, carts, delivery vans occupy the remaining space inside the bus terminus, which leaves little space for the buses.

Even after Monday’s drive, still there are shops occupying the space on one side and two wheeler riders have made this space convenient to park. If these issues are addressed, an additional 10 buses could be accommodated in the terminus. At present 180 buses are being operated from the old bus terminus.

Corporation officials said that they would look into the issues pertaining to encroachments by shopkeepers and steps would be taken to check unauthorised parking of vehicles with the help of police.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/2ubnaw/article30907596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THEVICTIONVELLORE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/officials-evict-shops-in-terminus-to-free-space-for-buses/article30907599.ece

The Centre has asked Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to explain in writing, by the first week of March, their positions with regard to the row over the Pennaiyar river.

This was decided at Monday's inaugural meeting of the Negotiation Committee, which was constituted by the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti a month ago to resolve issues concerning the river. Central Water Commission chairman Rajendra Kumar Jain presided over the meeting.

At the meeting in New Delhi which lasted nearly 90 minutes, Tamil Nadu wanted the Centre to bring to a halt several projects of Karnataka which included drawing of water to fill 160 tanks and for irrigation purposes and drawing of 284 million cubic feet (mcft) of water. Karnataka took the stand that Tamil Nadu had nothing to fear as the projects would not affect its rights, according to two officials of the State government.

In November last year, the Supreme Court, while dismissing Tamil Nadu’s suit for injunction on the projects, asked Karnataka to approach the Centre for getting a tribunal formed to resolve the issue.

The distribution of solatiums of ₹2 lakh each to the legal heirs of 14 deceased members of the AIADMK, the disbursal of assistance of ₹1 lakh each to 109 indigent worker-members of the Anna Thozhirsangam and the inauguration of a three-day health camp marked the 72nd birth anniversary celebrations of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Monday.

At the AIADMK headquarters, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam cut a 72-kg cake to mark the occasion. They also launched a mass feeding programme.

They christened a boy child and a girl child of C. Govindan and Gandhimathi Govindan, a couple hailing from Thandarampattu union of Tiruvannamalai district, as Jaijeevan and Jayashree.

As part of a State government programme, 72 lakh saplings would be planted by December. The scheme was inaugurated by the CM near the Secretariat.

In line with the government’s decision to observe the Girl Child Protection Day on the occasion of Jayalalithaa’s birth anniversary, Mr. Palaniswami handed over deposit certificates for ₹25,000 each to 14 girls who had joined the Girl Child Protection Scheme, and cheques to seven women who had crossed the age of 18, as the deposits, made in their names, had matured.

190,2020/02/25,DMK insulted farmers by walking out during delta Bill’s passage: Edappadi Palaniswami,"Anyone who boycotts farmers will not be able to come to power, says Palaniswami

Assailing Opposition leader M.K. Stalin and legislators of the DMK for staging a walkout when the Bill to declare certain districts in the Cauvery delta as being part of a Protected Agricultural Zone was tabled in the Assembly, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Monday said that by doing so, Mr. Stalin had insulted farmers.

Hence, the farmers must teach the DMK a lesson during the elections, he said.

Addressing a public meeting organised as part of the birth anniversary celebrations of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in Salem, Mr. Palaniswami said Mr. Stalin did not expect and couldn't digest his announcement regarding the Protected Agricultural Zone in the delta region.

""Soon after the announcement was made, Mr. Stalin raised questions as to whether it could be implemented. We immediately contacted the Centre and sought their help to implement this. They offered assistance and said the State could decide on the matter. Based on this, we have issued a G.O. today,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

""When the Bill was tabled in the Assembly, Mr. Stalin and DMK members staged a walkout to stop its passage. Farmers will never forgive them for this. Anyone who boycotts farmers will not be able to come to power,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

He added that delta farmers should deal a huge blow to those who insulted them in future elections.

Alleging that Mr. Stalin did not know anything about agriculture, Mr. Palaniswami displayed a picture of the DMK leader wearing socks and walking through a sugarcane farm, reportedly in Erode, when concrete pavement had been laid inside the farm. The CM said he (Mr. Palaniswami) was an example of an ideal farmer.

Listing various development and welfare schemes being implemented by the AIADMK government, Mr. Palaniswami said the State government had made efforts to implement the ₹10,000-crore eight-lane Salem-Chennai greenfield corridor project, but the Opposition parties had sought to stop it by spreading lies among the public. Mr. Palaniswami said the Centre had now upgraded it into an expressway project, and the State government was making efforts to implement it.

On the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens, Mr. Palaniswami said the AIADMK had been in power “for 30 years” in the State, and not once during that time had a member of a minority community been affected.

He alleged that the NPR was first implemented in 2011 when the DMK was in power, and it was the same NPR that was now being carried out with only three new questions.

191,2020/02/25,Delhi violence state sponsored: Owaisi,"Faults Kishan Reddy’s absence from Delhi

All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi on Tuesday claimed that the violence in Delhi is not a communal riot but State-sponsored violence.

Mr. Owaisi, addressing the media at party headquarters in Darussalaam, sought to buttress his allegation by invoking Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kapil Mishra’s recent reported ‘ultimatum’ to clear roads of anti-CAA protesters or he would not listen to the police.

“Whatever violence is happening in Delhi is State-sponsored violence. If an ex-MLA gives ultimatum in presence of a DCP, he was told by the party to stand with DCP and give the ultimatum. We are all seeing what is happening because of it,” Mr. Owaisi claimed, and said that he condemned all kinds of violence.

The Hyderabad parliamentarian criticised Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy for his presence in Hyderabad said that he should take charge of his ministry and put an end to the violence. “Your presence is Hyderabad and absence in Delhi gives the impression that you too knew that there was something brewing,” Mr. Owaisi said.

Earlier in the day the AIMIM chief took to Twitter and batted for the army’s presence to stop the violence. “The situation in North East Delhi is only getting worse. If @PMOIndia wants to restore peace, it is incumbent on you that Army takes over the area. Cops have abdicated their duty & are colluding with mobs. The only way to secure lives & limbs is to hand over the area to the army,” he tweeted.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/xr3u7x/article30916085.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25OWAISI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/delhi-violence-state-sponsored-owaisi/article30916086.ece
192,2020/02/25,CPI activists held for protest against Trump’s visit,"Arrested leaders, cadre released later

The Communist Party of India has alleged that the visit of United States of America President Donald Trump was aimed at serving the selfish and business interests of the US and the agreements relating to agriculture products made with the US were against economic interests of the country.

CPI activists led by the party’s national secretariat member K. Narayana, former MP Azeez Pasha and State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy staged a demonstration in the vicinity of the US Consulate at Begumpet here on Monday in protest against Mr. Trump’s visit to the country. The leaders squatted on the arterial road and raised slogans against the US disrupting the traffic. They were forcibly removed from the place and sent to Bowenpally, Trimulgherry and other police stations and were released later.

In a press release, the CPI expressed concern that Mr. Trump’s visit concluded without any assurance on easing the stringent restrictions imposed on grant of H1B visas to Indians. The US, on its part, was interfering in the affairs of Cuba, Palestine, Iran and other countries with imperialist motives. The CPI had also opposed Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s decision to attend the dinner hosted by President Ramnath Kovind in honour of the US President.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/1kgc8z/article30915974.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25CPIACTIVISTSSTAGING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cpi-stages-protest-against-trumps-visit/article30915874.ece

195,2020/02/25,‘Can courts intervene on policy decisions of government?’,"HC to hold final hearing on Secretariat demolition issue on Tuesday

Telangana High Court will hold final hearing on March 3 on a batch of PIL pleas over the State government’s decision to demolish the Secretariat building and on the issue of whether courts can intervene in an important policy decision taken by the government.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy decided to hold the final hearing on the matter after Advocate General B.S. Prasad on Tuesday raised it. Mentioning about the PIL petitions over government’s proposal to demolish the existing Secretariat building (now completely evacuated) and construction of a new one, the AG appealed to the Bench to decide if the HC can intervene over a key policy decision taken by the government.

He was referring to an order passed by the Bench 13 days ago staying demolition of Secretariat building until the government takes a final call on the design of new Secretariat building and on demolition of Secretariat building. Before the Bench passed the direction on this February 12, Additional Advocate General J. Ramchander Rao told the court that day during the arguments that government had not yet taken a decision on demolition of Secretariat building.

Key decisions

Presenting his contentions, the AG on Tuesday said the larger question in the issue was whether the courts can decide upon legality of a major policy decision taken by government. Can the courts interdict the government’s key decision on an issue like building new Secretariat, he asked.

Stating that entire Secretariat had been presently evacuated, the AG said the Bench should decide upon the issue as to whether the court can interfere with the government’s decision just because some one approaches it opposing such policy decision. Is challenging the legality of government’s calls on key issues sustainable is an important issue to be adjudicated, the AG said.

The Bench decided to hold the final hearing on the issues raised by the AG including the facts, information and the position of law related to them at 2.30 p.m. on March 3.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/djh92y/article30915413.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY26TELANGANAHIGHCOURTBUILDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/can-courts-intervene-on-policy-decisions-of-government/article30915414.ece

198,2020/02/25,Peak power demand crosses 13K MW in TS,"Rabi cultivation in greater extent and operation of lift irrigation projects jacks up demand

From the situation of struggling to meet even the highest of 5,661 MW intra-day peak load in June 2014, when Telangana was formed, the State has come a long way to meet the peak demand of 13,040 MW on Tuesday with the consumption being pulled by all sectors of consumers, particularly from agriculture and lift irrigation.

At 8.01 a.m. on February 25, the peak power demand in the State crossed the 13,000 MW barrier and recorded at about 13,040 MW. By doing so, Telangana has become the second State after Tamil Nadu among the Southern States now to handle the demand beyond 13,000 MW.

When contacted, Chairman and Managing Director of TS-Genco and TS-Transco D. Prabhakar Rao told The Hindu that there was only one instance wherein the peak demand had crossed the 13,000 MW barrier during combined Andhra Pradesh. It was in March 2014, the peak demand was recorded at 13,162 MW and at that time it was the first Southern State to do so as Tamil Naidu was second in terms of peak demand and energy consumption.

Stating that the peak demand of power was expected to go up further, Mr. Rao said it could soon cross the combined State record of 13,162 MW peak demand too.

Surpasses Karnataka

After bifurcation of combined AP into Telangana and AP, only Tamil Nadu had been recording demand of over 13,000 MW. In terms of energy consumption, Telangana had also surpassed Karnataka by registering around 250 million units (MU) every day for more than last one week and attributed the increase in demand to intensive agricultural operations and functioning of lift irrigation projects and schemes.

Cultivation of crops in the ongoing rabi season has reached about 17.57 lakh hectares, a record extent ever in Telangana for the season, with a lion’s share of it being covered by water-intensive paddy in about 12 lakh ha followed by other major crops such as maize in 1.86 lakh ha, bengalgram in 1.49 lakh ha and groundnut in 1.16 lakh ha.

Kaleshwaram pumping

“Pumping of water from Kaleshwaram project to replenish minor irrigation tanks is still going on to irrigate the standing crops and it will continue further,” a project engineer said.

When asked about the means of meeting the peaking energy demand in the State, Mr. Prabhakar Rao explained that they were procuring only about 30 million units a day under short-term purchases and the remaining 210 MU was being met from own generation (about 120 MU), central generating stations (50 MU) and other long-term purchases from Chhattisgarh, Sembcorp and others.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/50a144/article30915154.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY26KLIP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/peak-power-demand-crosses-13k-mw-in-ts/article30915157.ece

201,2020/02/25,WB report flags causes of road crash fatalities in India,"Concern over lack of comprehensive and inclusive approach in road safety management

The World Bank has expressed concern over the lack of comprehensive and inclusive approach in road safety management at national and sub-national levels that are resulting in high annual number of road crash fatalities.

In its recent report “delivering road safety in India: Leadership priorities and initiatives to 2030”, the Bank recalled a World Health Organisation report which said road crash fatalities in the country accounted for 11% of the estimated 1.35 million global toll each year. Vulnerable road users, primarily pedestrians, cyclists and two-wheeler riders account for almost 54% of the fatalities and serious injuries.

The report termed the high volume, high-speed roads as dangerous and said national highways that make up just 1.94% of the road network in the country accounted for 35.7% of the crash fatalities. Rural areas accounted for more than 66% of all road deaths. Road users between the ages of 18 and 45 comprised 69% of the fatalities.

Over speeding

The report said more than 36% of all crash fatalities were two-wheeler riders and passengers. Describing speeding as a serious issue, it said 67% of crashes, 64% of fatalities and 67% of serious injuries were attributed to over speeding. “More fundamentally, speed is a crucial contributor to all crash deaths and injuries,” the report said.

Road user compliance with motorcycle helmet and seat belt laws is reportedly low, the bank said quoting a survey which revealed that almost 50% of all two-wheeler drivers and 75% of pillion riders reported that they did not wear helmets. According to another survey, the reported rate of seat belt use among both drivers and other occupants was only 25% and as low as 4% for rear seats. “Enforcement of seat belt use in the rear seat is rare,” the report said.

Though comprehensive laws that address alcohol limits for the general driving population, young or novice drivers and professional and commercial drivers were in place, drink driving continues to be a concern. Overloading of heavy vehicles too was another area of concern accounting for 10% of all reported crashes and 12% of reported fatalities in 2018.

Licencing authorities

Regional Transport Offices which are tasked with the responsibility of issuing drivers’ licenses are being ill equipped in terms of staff and testing facilities to deal effectively and efficiently with growing number of applications for licenses in view of the rapid motorization. Given the staff shortages and the aim to make testing and issuing licenses more objective, almost every State is now setting up automated driver testing tracks. “However, the licensing procedure is not uniform,” the report said.

Agencies responsible for road safety were inadequately empowered and resourced to deal with escalating danger on their roads. “More effective, efficient and scaled-up initiatives are needed,” the report added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/4qyqog/article30915733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY26ROADSAFETY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/wb-report-flags-causes-of-road-crash-fatalities-in-india/article30914301.ece

205,2020/02/25,24 migrant bonded labourers rescued in Karimnagar,"Modalities for providing compensation being worked out; brick kiln owner booked

The district authorities rescued 24 migrant bonded labourers from Odisha, including six child labourers and nine women, who were languishing in a brick kiln since the last two months in Gambhiraopet mandal.

Following credible information and a complaint, the authorities led by Revenue, Labour Department and police visited the brick kiln on Monday and rescued the bonded labourers.

Debarchan Jal, one of the migrant labourers from Patrapali village of Bolangir district, said around 28 migrant labourers from the district migrated to Gambhiraopet to work in a brick kiln owned by one Nigam on the promise of providing good wages, food, accommodation and good working conditions in the first week of January this year through a middleman, Ghunsagar Sagdia, from Tankapani village of Bolangir.

However, the labourers were forced to live in unhygienic conditions. Each labourer was paid only ₹300 per week to meet food expenses and there was no payment for children. They were forced to work for 14 to 16 hours a day and even beaten up and harassed for not working. Children who were below 14 years were also forced to work in the kilns, he said.

Unable to bear the mental agony and beatings, four migrant labourers escaped and went back to Odisha, Mr. Jal said. He also complained that the owner had not paid them any amount even after being rescued.

Meanwhile, official sources said that all the 24 labourers are being shifted in two vehicles to Ramagundam railway station to board a train bound to Odisha.

The officials, who rescued the migrant labourers, said that they are taking all measures to provide compensation to the labourers as per the Bonded Labour Act and other acts.

The police are registering a case against kiln owner Nigam under Bonded Labour Act, Child Labour Act, and SC/ST Act.

The officials said that they would take all measures to provide compensation to the rescued labourers as per norms and are working out all modalities by collecting applications from the labourers.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/e4ekse/article30907297.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25LABOURERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/24-migrant-bonded-labourers-rescued/article30907298.ece

The spirit of equality and spiritual fervour reigned supreme at Sri Lakshmi Ranganatha Swamy temple here on Monday as it played host to Munivahana Utsavam, an ancient ritual spreading the message of equality.

The famous temple, an abode of Lord Ranganatha Swamy, at Ranganayakulagutta here was abuzz with hectic activity as hordes of devotees flocked to the temple to watch the re-enactment of the ancient ritual that originated in the historic Srirangam Ranganatha Swamy temple of Tamil Nadu, about 2,700 years ago.

The ritual involved carrying of a Dalit devotee by a priest from Bhadrachalam on his shoulders into the temple amid much fanfare.

The event was jointly organised by the Temples Protection Movement (TPM), Samajika Samarasatha Vedika, Sri Narsimha Vahini and various other Dharmik organisations. It was performed under the supervision of TPM convenor and Chilkur Balaji temple head priest C.S. Rangarajan.

The ritual got off to an impressive start under the aegis of Mr Rangarajan, who garlanded the statue of Mahatma Gandhi, a crusader against untouchability, in the town before leading a shobha yatra to the temple at Ranganayakulagutta here.

The streets surrounding the temple echoed with the rhythmic beats of kolatam performed by women devotees. The ancient ritual was re-enacted amid recital of melodious nadaswaram. Chants hailing Lord Ranganatha Swamy and Jai Sri Ram slogans rent the air.

Special prayers

Later, Mr Rangarajan along with the Dalit devotee and the Bhadrachalam-based priest besides a host of others offered special prayers at the flower-bedecked temple. Speaking on the occasion, he said the idea behind re-enacting the centuries-old Munivahana Seva ritual was to propagate the message of equality of all human beings before God.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/2sbupl/article30907218.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY24-KHM-TEMPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/conveying-a-powerful-message-of-equality/article30907206.ece

The lawsuit names Island Express Helicopters, Island Express Holding Corp. and the estate of the helicopter’s pilot, Ara Zobayan, who was among the victims.

Gianna Bryant’s basketball teammates Alyssa Altobelli and Payton Chester, Altobelli’s parents John and Keri, Payton’s mother Sarah and basketball coach Christina Mauser were also killed.

The National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating the exact cause of the crash, although preliminary findings showed no sign of mechanical failure.

Monday’s lawsuit faults the company for allowing the helicopter to fly in “heavy fog and low clouds” that Sunday morning, conditions which prompted “law enforcement agencies and tour companies” to ground their helicopters.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/vanessa-bryant-sues-helicopter-company/article30916153.ece
210,2020/02/25,Somesh Kumar brings out the meaning of films and shows through his posters,"The Bengaluru-based graphic designer has come up with illustrated posters of films and shows such as 'Sacred Games', 'Stranger Things' and 'Game of Thrones'

“If you look at the history of film posters, illustrations were a big thing but over a period of time photography took over because of the ease that comes with the medium,” says Somesh Kumar whose work is being showcased under Chitrakaar watching Chitrahaar at The Courtyard till March 6. Expect to see illustrated posters of films and shows such as Sacred Games, Stranger Things, Game of Thrones, Masaan, Kaagaz Ke Phool, Andhadhun, Inside Llewyn Davis, and Pather Panchali.

The 32-year-old Bengaluru-based graphic designer and illustrator, who runs ByTwo Design with his friend Hazel Karkaria, merged his love for illustrations and films to create this passion project. “I have been working on the posters for the last seven years. I have used the alternative version of a film poster of bringing out the idea behind the script with illustrations.”

Stating that he has created posters for the films and shows he enjoys, Somesh says, “Generally, what happens is that when I’m watching something, I get an idea that this can be a good film poster. For example, I was watching Andhadhun and the scene where the bird dropping falls on his glasses doesn’t seem very consequential but it’s a sign of how everything changes for the protagonist. Then I had the thought that it would be nice to do a poster where it is a close-up. If you look closely, you can see the reflection of the piano he is playing and under the piano are the legs of the dead body. From a distance, it just looks like Ayushmann Khurrana’s face with the bird dropping on the glasses but when you go near, you see something more and that’s what the film is in a way. There are many layers and things that happen within the story.”

Somesh adds that lately he has been integrating gifs and film posters together. “It works really well for social media. It gives you a bit more to play with because you can animate certain things. It is a mini narrative with a beginning, middle and end.”

As for the art of film poster-making and how it has changed, Somesh says, “With illustrations, it is more of collectibles and not mainstream. Mainstream posters are tied to the idea of having the cast on the poster. And it doesn’t let the idea of marrying that with the story of the film. The only time illustrations happen is when it’s done for a film festival or as a collectible. Also, using illustrations as a medium for film posters doesn’t happen a lot. It happens when it is a big film. For example, in south India, you have really large cut-outs when a big film is going to release or driven by print-making where lithography was used a lot. In Bangalore and Karnataka, I have seen these typical lithographic posters that are fluorescent in colour. They are cheaply produced but still use illustration and has its own sense of aesthetic.”

211,2020/02/25,From paint to patina: The third dimension,"‘Bronzed: From Paint to Patina’ project involved re-imaging some of the paintings of Thota Vaikuntam, Jogen Chowdhury, Krishen Khanna and Ram Kumar, as sculptures

Bronze sculptures inspired by the repertoire of four of India’s celebrated artists — Thota Vaikuntam, Jogen Chowdhury, Krishen Khanna and the late Ram Kumar — are now on view at Hyderabad’s Kalakriti art gallery, after being showcased at the India Art Fair (IAF) 2020, New Delhi.

Twenty six sculptures exhibited at IAF as part of ‘Bronzed - From Paint to Patina’ project, act like a window into the iconic works of the four artists, in sculpture form.

The four artists are known for their distinctive styles. One needn’t be a connoisseur of art; even a casual observer of art in Hyderabad would be be able to identify the rural Telangana men and women as portrayed in Vaikuntam’s paintings. These two-dimensional paintings, when transformed into three-dimensional bronze sculptures, make observers of art to take a fresh look and reinterpret it.

A sculpture by Jogen Chowdhury

The sculptures are mostly in muted colours, minimalistic and occupy prominent spaces in the uncluttered gallery of Kalakriti, to enable visitors to observe the techniques of each of the artists in detail.

The late Ram Kumar who is regarded as one of India’s most reputed abstract painters had painted figurative works in the 1950s.

Clay to bronze

The artist was enthusiastic about re-imagining some of this imagery as sculptures, decades later. His sculptures presented in this project were commissioned and approved by him.

His paintings were the first point of reference, after which artisans who collaborated with him made clay or wax models. These were worked upon further by Ram Kumar who supervised the corrections before the final sculptures took shape, in collaboration with UK’s sculpture casting foundry — Bronze Age London. The angular faces of the sculptures have a definitive sheen enabled by the superior smooth finish made possible by the casting process.

Thota Vaikuntam’s sculptures re-create the sari drapes and their fall with precision, immortalising the images of the rural women clad in vermilion red or mint-green saris.

From Krishen Khanna’s collection, the band series is in focus. Men who play as part of wedding music bands get a true-to-reality portrayal as they create music while at a ceremony, frozen in motion.

Cross-hatching

Jogen Chowdhury’s bronze sculptures were among the toughest to re-imagine from his paintings, according to the gallery, given the visual cross-hatching effect that was required. The process involved taking several printed images of his paintings, from different angles, to analyse the cross-hatching patterns and translate them to sculptures with the help of artisans. Clay models were created and worked upon, corrected and revised, before the patina process began.

The most challenging process of re-imagining paintings as sculptures was to match the original colour tones. Though the bronze patina colour palette tends to be different from paint colours, the process involved mixing different hues that reacted at high temperatures and ultimately would match the colours of the paintings.

212,2020/02/25,Sandilya Theuerkauf talks about his work and Nature in its entirety,"A beautifully stark eyeopener

Thorns rarely figure in the scheme of things for anyone, unless you are a florist or perhaps a customer at said florist’s.

But for Sandilya Theuerkauf, thorns are a medium to create and display the manifold wonders of Nature. “I have always wanted to do something with the different aspects of things around us,” says the artist, who is not interested in the interpretation of his work. Sandilya insists the focus of his work are not the thorns themselves despite their unusual appeal, but that they are a part of the whole in the process of creating.

“I would not be able to work with thorns if someone just gave them to me. The process of procuring, of scouring a landscape, that is what I give importance to. Time spent observing, listening, in the knowing of a place, in the deliberateness of being involved in a particular location, are all part of the process of creation, a part of its intricacy and challenge. Visualising, implementing and creating are all a part of my work,” says Sandilya.

Sandilya, who has been working with thorns since 2015, has collected them from acacia trees, palms and other flora. Each thorn is individually sanded or smoothed down before it is affixed on to the installations.

“I have always worked with my hands,” he says. “Over a period of time, we learn how thorns bend, how much thorns can bend, the direction they take. There is a marked focus in concentration while working with thorns.”

A teacher at Centre for Learning, where he was also once a student, Sandilya feels people are in a constant hurry to judge and label without paying attention to a place. “There should be a conscious attempt to look beyond what we see,” he says, adding, “One needs to go past filters and labels that we put on ourselves or the things around us, including definitions of aesthetics.”

“Everyone notices a sunset or waterfall, but Nature is so much more — we notice only certain aspects of it. How to give our attention to it as a whole is what I am trying to explore here,” he says.

“Our relationship with this planet should be explored to the fullest; we only have this planet. It is also very fragile and there is a gradual disappearance of what once was. Only if we are conscious of that we will not take it for granted,” says Sandilya.

According to Manush John who has captured Sandilya at work in his short film, Trail of Thorns, each installation is a reflection of Sandilya’s experience of a place. “Over the time spent observing Sandilya at work and his work itself, I have come to understand his creations are a negotiation with the spaces he inhabits,” says Manush.

Trail of Thorns is on display online at KYNKYNY.com till March 31.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/nr1md2/article30912769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THORN1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/sandilya-theuerkauf-talks-about-his-work-and-nature-in-its-entirety/article30912773.ece

The Bharatiya Janata Party government in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday said it had decided to change the name of the Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti Urdu-Arabi-Farsi University, a State varsity in the capital.

The varsity would now be called Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Bhasha Vishwavidyalaya (language university), the government said in a statement.

The “partial” name change came after Governor Anandiben Patel last year, during the convocation of the varsity, suggested that it drop the “Urdu-Arabi-Farsi” from its name.

An amendment would be brought in the U.P. State Universities Act, 1973, the government said.

214,2020/02/25,"36 years on, man walks free in murder case tied to a watch","“It is solely based on circumstantial evidence”

The Supreme Court has acquitted a convict in a 36-year-old murder case which hinged solely on the victim’s faulty Anglo-Swiss watch.

The prosecution case that Md. Younus Ali Tarafdar of West Bengal killed one Becharam Dhara was entirely built on the surmise that he gave the victim’s watch for repair three days after he went missing.

Also Read Also Read Who will police the police? Supreme Court asked 38 years ago

The case dates back to March 1984 when a decomposed body was found inside a well in a garden in Rajarhat. Autopsy revealed that the cause of death was asphyxia. The prosecution said the body was cremated immediately as it was in a decomposed state.

A few days later, Kenaram Dhara visited the police station to report that his brother, Becharam, was missing since March 15. Policemen showed him photographs of the body they had cremated and Kenaram went on to identify it as his brother’s.

Tarafdar and three others were arrested during the investigation. The primary evidence against Tarafdar was a counterfoil of the receipt from a watch repair shop that the police said was found in his house. The other factor was that three of Becharam’s family members testified that he had planned to visit Tarafdar on March 15.

The trial court acquitted the three fellow accused, but found Tarafdar guilty of the murder. He was sentenced to a life behind bars. The High Court court confirmed the sentence.

In his appeal, heard by a Bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao and Deepak Gupta, Tarafdar argued that he was coerced into making the confession. The counterfoil was not recovered from his house. The defence argued that the body was mutilated and hardly recognisable. Only photographs were shown to the relatives, not the body itself.

The apex court believed him. “There is no direct evidence regarding the involvement of the appellant in the crime. The case of the prosecution is on the basis of circumstantial evidence… A close scrutiny of the material on record would disclose that the circumstances relied upon by the prosecution to prove the guilt of the appellant were not complete and do not lead to the conclusion that in all human probability the murder must have been committed by the appellant,” Justice Rao wrote in the judgment pronounced on February 20.

The court said circumstances incriminating a man should be of a “conclusive nature and tendency.” The circumstances “should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oaaf6u/article30706068.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-supreme-court-of-india,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/supreme-court-acquits-convict-in-36-year-old-murder-case/article30915704.ece

Developmental activities of the State government in the remote areas of the district made him realise the futility of the Maoist path of violence. Increased penetration and area dominance of the security forces also pressured him to leave the path. He also found that the Maoists leaders were not concerned about the development of the poor villagers living in Tulsi reserve forest area. The behaviour of senior Maoist leader Sanju of the Kanger Ghati area committee and the regional feelings between the Telugu and other cadres also prompted him to surrender.

“The Maoists have their own vested interests and are not for the development of the region or welfare of the people. This has resulted in the desertion of the cadre,” said the DIG. According to him, the Maoists in the district, especially those in the Swabhiman Anchal, are led by Telugu speaking leaders and their cadre are mostly innocent tribals from Chhattisgarh. As result, they do not have any affiliation with the people of Malkangiri or Odisha, whom they exploit and kill, he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cc3sga/article30915031.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200225-WA0012,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cpi-maoist-leader-with-5-lakh-reward-surrenders-in-odisha/article30915032.ece

217,2020/02/25,Indefinite strike call in Tripura against Bru refugee settlement,"Security alert as rift between refugees and local population widens.

Several organisations have called an indefinite general strike in north Tripura’s Kanchanpur subdivision from Wednesday to protest against a move to resettle the Mizoram Bru refugees in the State. The rift between the refugees and the local population has widened after groups representing Mizo residents of Jampui Hills, a tourist hub in Kanchanpur, has extended support to the ongoing stir of the Nagarik Suraksha Manch (Citizens’ Protection Forum).

The Forum spearheaded the movement also to press for the rehabilitation of 93 non-tribal Bengali families who were displaced during the anti-CAA protests in December. It accuses the Bru refugees of siding with the rioters to attack non-tribal villages.

A quadripartite agreement was signed in New Delhi on January 16 to resettle over 34,000 Bru or Reang refugees stranded in Tripura. Union Home Minister Amit Shah and the Chief Ministers of Tripura and Mizoram were present on the occasion that fulfilled the long-time aspiration of the evacuees housed in six makeshift camps for over two decades.

The National Green Tribunal on Tuesday ordered status quo on the construction work related to Bhopal Smart City project which involves cutting of more than 6,000 trees in Tatya Tope Nagar.

A Bench headed by Justice Raghuvendra S. Rathore issued notices to the Bhopal Smart City Development Corporation Limited, Director-cum-Chairman of the Directorate of Town and Country Planning Madhya Pradesh and Bhopal Municipal Corporation.

“It has been contended by the counsel for the applicant that in the map attached to the EIA (environmental impact assessment) project report shows that places such as stadium and dussehra maidan have been included as areas for development of green belt. In the meanwhile, we direct the parties to maintain the status quo as it exists today,” the Bench said.

The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by Green and Green Lawyers contending that there will be significant air and noise pollution problems due to movement of traffic in the area due to cutting of 1,500 trees which were acting as a buffer and reducing noise and dust pollution.

The plea alleged that there have been numerous violations of environmental obligations by the project proponent in respect of smart city project in Bhopal being undertaken by Bhopal Smart City Development Corporation Limited and Bhopal Municipal Corporation.

“There were 1,500 trees of various species and sizes planted by Forest Department during the year 1960-1970 which were cut without exploring the possibility of translocation in order to achieve the goal of Smart City Project, the respondents are seeking to destroy the entire green belt and to achieve the said purpose is removing the trees from the said plots of land and would thereby destroyed all trees on the said green belt which acts as a buffer against vehicular pollution,” the plea said.

The petition said the 10% green belt area of the layout of Bhopal Smart City should have been mandatorily available for the compensatory plantation of the native species of trees in lieu of 6,000 trees proposed to be cut.

However, it is doubtful as the T.T. Nagar Stadium and Dussehra Maidan are shown as green belt area in the smart city project where plantation is not possible and without looking at the availability of land for plantation the other project proponent, Bhopal Municipal Corporation, in “sheer abuse” of power simply granted permission for cutting down about 1,500 trees and further 4,500 trees are in line to be cut in near future, the plea said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rejn2r/article30914397.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25IN-TREEWALKGREENHERITAGEAGAINSTSMARTCITYBHOPALMADHYAPRADE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bhopal-smart-city-project-ngt-orders-status-quo-on-construction-work/article30914360.ece
221,2020/02/25,"Minutes after rebuke from Nitish in Assembly, Tejashwi walks into his chamber","Neither spoke about what transpired during the conversation that lasted a few minutes.

Minutes after an avuncular admonition by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on the floor of the Bihar Assembly on Tuesday, Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav walked into the chamber of his former boss.

Mr. Kumar took exception to a snide remark by Mr. Yadav, who keeps training his guns at the JD(U) national president over his abrupt exit from the Grand Alliance in 2017.

The House was witnessing a debate on an adjournment motion moved by Mr. Yadav and other Opposition MLAs against the CAA-NPR-NRC.

“Please refrain from these things that you keep saying about me. Your father has a right to do so but not you,” Mr. Kumar said with a mix of vexation and endearment, reminding Mr. Yadav (30) that he belonged to RJD supremo Lalu Prasad’s generation.

Mr. Prasad is in Ranchi at present, serving sentences in fodder scam cases.

The normally combative Mr. Yadav apparently saw the point as he rose from his seat but sat down immediately with a wistful smile.

Later, as the House was adjourned for lunch, Mr. Kumar went to his chamber and subsequently, the Leader of the Opposition was seen walking into his chamber.

Neither spoke about what transpired during the conversation that lasted a few minutes but they are understood to have exchanged pleasantries, after which Mr. Yadav apprised Mr. Kumar of the anxieties in the opposition camp over CAA-NPR-NRC and received assurances from the latter that things would never be allowed to go out of control in Bihar.

Mr. Kumar, who decided to walk out of the Grand Alliance after Mr. Yadav’s name cropped up in a money-laundering case, has maintained that he always had affection for the latter, who is younger than his own son.

He has also been saying that had Mr. Yadav heeded to the demands for his resignation and done so for the period until exoneration, it would have given a boost to his political standing.

Mr. Yadav, the younger son of former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad, learnt the ropes under Mr. Kumar’s mentorship while serving as his deputy at a tender age of 25.

While Mr. Yadav was the Deputy Chief Minister in the Grand Alliance government led by Mr. Kumar in 2015, his elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav served as a senior Minister then.

PDP president Mehbooba Mufti’s daughter Iltija Mufti on Tuesday said the country has degenerated into a place where the majority’s “zeal for bigotry” has dealt a body blow to its diversity.

Iltija, who uses her mother’s Twitter handle to comment on developments and events, wondered if the Muslims in India were even wanted anymore.

“Since the last 7 months, India’s degenerated into a place where majority’s zeal for bigotry has dealt a body blow to its diversity. I wonder if we Muslims are wanted or even belong here anymore. Unimaginable despair,” she tweeted.

Commenting on multiple social media posts on why a man who reportedly opened fire during Monday’s violence in Delhi was not arrested, Iltija said because he was not a Kashmiri or Muslim.

227,2020/02/25,2G mobile Internet services extended in JK till March 4; tighter vigil on use of VPNs,"The 2G Internet facility on mobile phones was restored in Jammu and Kashmir on January 25.

Social networking sites allowing peer-to-peer communication and virtual private networks (VPNs) will remain unavailable in Jammu and Kashmir as anti-national elements and people across the border continue to “misuse” these platforms, the authorities said on Tuesday as 2G mobile Internet services were extended till March 4.

Issuing an order here, the home department of the union territory said that while assessing the impact of the directions relating to regulation of telecom services, it has come to fore that VPNs continue to be misused by the ANE (anti-national elements), including their handlers from across the border, to bypass the Internet restrictions.

It said that VPNs come handy for them to coordinate with their operatives within the UT and plan terror acts and scale up anti-national activities.

Jammu and Kashmir Home Secretary Shaleen Kabra, while signing the order, said restrictions would continue till March 4.

As per the order, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have been asked to ensure access to 1,674 white-listed sites only and not to any social media applications allowing peer-to-peer communication and VPN applications, the order said.

The 2G Internet facility on mobile phones was restored in Jammu and Kashmir on January 25 after remaining suspended since August 5 last year after the Centre announced abrogation of Article 370 provisions and bifurcation of the erstwhile state into union territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

The order said that there have been reports that attempts have been made to disturb public peace by spreading rumours to incite the general public which necessitated temporary suspension of mobile data services for limited period of time by the authorised officers.

“Data services shall be available on the postpaid mobiles and on prepaid SIM cards of such holders whose credentials have been verified as per the norms applicable for postpaid connections; and the internet speed shall be restricted to 2G only,” the order said.

“Internet connectivity shall be available only after mac-binding. It is further directed that all those who are provided access to the internet shall ensure that it is not misused for uploading the provocative material inimical to the interest of the state,” the order read.

Mr. Kabra said the access or communication facilities made available by the government by way of e-terminals or Internet kiosks apart from special arrangements for tourists, students and traders would continue.

The inspector generals of police, Kashmir and Jammu, would ensure communication of these directions to the service providers forthwith and ensure implementation of the directions with immediate effect, the order said.

228,2020/02/25,Vipin Parmar to become new Speaker of Himachal Assembly,"The 55-year-old BJP leader will be formally declared as the new Speaker on Wednesday

Himachal Pradesh minister Vipin Parmar is set to become the next Speaker of the state Assembly.

Mr. Parmar filed his nomination papers on Tuesday for the Speaker’s post to assembly secretary Yash Paul Sharma in the presence of Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur and former speaker Rajeev Bindal.

The 55-year-old BJP leader will be formally declared as the new Speaker on Wednesday as no other member of the legislative assembly has filed his or her nomination.

The opposition Congress did not file any nomination for the Speaker’s post as it has only 21 members in the 68-member House. The ruling BJP has a total of 44 MLAs whereas the CPI (M) has a lone MLA. Two independent MLAs are supporting the BJP.

The Speaker’s post has been lying vacant since January 16 when the then Speaker Rajeev Bindal submitted his resignation. Mr. Bindal was later elected as the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president.

The chief minister told the media late Monday that the BJP high command had decided to appoint Health and Family Welfare Minister Vipin Parmar as the new Speaker.

Mr. Thakur said he had talked with BJP national president J.P. Nadda in this regard and that Mr. Nadda finalised the name of the MLA from Sullah constituency in Kangra district for the Speaker’s post.

Born on March 15, 1964 in Kangra’s Nanao village, Mr. Parmar is a law graduate and MLA from Sullah assembly constituency.

Mr. Parmar was elected to the state legislative assembly for the first time in 1998. He was re-elected as MLA in 2007 and 2017. He was inducted into the Council of Ministers as Health Minister along with the portfolios of Medical Education, Ayurveda and Science and Technology on December 27, 2017.

He also remained organizing secretary of state Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and secretary of national ABVP.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/xkwp3m/article30912846.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Vipin,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vipin-parmar-to-become-new-speaker-of-himachal-assembly/article30912847.ece

230,2020/02/25,Assam Accord Clause 6: Panel submits report to Chief Minister,"“The ball is now in the Centre’s court,” says panel chairman

The high-powered committee that the Centre constituted in July 2019 for the implementation of Clause 6 of the Assam Accord of 1985 submitted its report to the State’s Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Tuesday.

Barring three leaders of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU), all the members of the panel headed by retired former Gauhati High Court Biplab Kumar Sarma were present at the event.

Clause 6 envisages constitutional, legislative and administrative measures to safeguard, protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people. It also seeks to ascertain who fits into the definition of an Assamese.

Also read | Constitutional safeguards for indigenous people a must: Assam students’ body

Mr. Sarma said the panel received a letter from Union Home Minister Amit Shah requesting the members to hand over the report to Mr. Sonowal on his behalf. The panel completed its report by February 15 and was expected to submit it to Mr. Shah in New Delhi more than a week ago.

“We received more than 1,200 memorandums, took the views of all communities across Assam and noted our observations for Constitutional safeguards of the indigenous people and for defining the Assamese people. The ball is now in the Centre’s court,” the panel’s chairman said, declining to reveal the contents of the report.

Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who was with Mr. Sonowal at the time of receiving the report, said commenting on the report would be premature until the Centre minutely examined it and sought the views of the State government.

“The State government has not been given a copy of the sealed report that will be submitted to the Centre today (Tuesday) evening or tomorrow (Wednesday) morning. Without seeing the report, it will be difficult to say if the government will accept the recommendations in entirety. We have to see if there is a recommendation that is against an order of the Supreme Court or it cannot be accepted by the Assembly,” he said.

The Centre, he added, was keen on implementing the recommendations provided they were within the ambit of the Constitution and the definition of Assamese was ratified by the Assembly.

“The committee has members with rich experience in administration. Their recommendations were perhaps within the Constitution and law. But the State government definitely has to discuss the definition of Assamese in the Assembly. It cannot be accepted without the approval of the Assembly. So, the matter has to be sent to the Assembly by the Centre,” the Finance Minister said.

The AASU’s chief advisor Samujjal Bhattacharya gave two reasons why the three members of the panel associated with the students’ body skipped the event. “By routing the report through the Assam government, the Centre has indicated it has lost enthusiasm about Clause 6. And while the report was being prepared, they brought in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act for the protection of Bangladeshis,” he said.

“The panel had a responsibility to submit the report with or without us. The job has been done,” he added.

The other AASU members of the panel are its president Dipanka Kumar Nath and general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi.

A government spokesperson said a controversy was being unnecessarily created over the submission of the report. “The CM is the head of the State administration. His chair has dignity. The Centre gave him a responsibility to accept the report on its behalf,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-accord-clause-6-panel-submits-report-to-chief-minister/article30912307.ece
231,2020/02/25,Kartarpur Corridor will remain open despite security concerns: Punjab CM Amarinder Singh,"‘Apprehensions are not because the corridor has been opened but because of the bad intent of Pakistan’

Amid the furore over Punjab Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta’s remark regarding the threat potential of the “'Kartarpur Corridor,” Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said regardless of security concerns, the Kartarpur Corridor shall remain open.

“The apprehensions of threat to the security of the people and the country were, however, serious, the Chief Minister said, adding that these apprehensions “are not because the corridor has been opened but because of the bad intent of Pakistan”.

Capt. Amarinder, who had requested the Speaker for permission to make his statement before the Question Hour, was responding in the State Assembly to the criticism by the Opposition of recent remarks of the State DGP regarding the threat potential of the Kartarpur Corridor.

“We will not let Kartarpur Corridor be closed down,” he said.

“The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor has been opened because we wanted it to be opened; every Punjabi wanted it, and had prayed for it in daily ‘Ardas’, along with praying for opening of Nankana Sahib, Panja Sahib and other Gurdwaras,” said Capt. Amarinder.

‘DGP apologised’

“The DGP had apologised; everybody makes mistakes; even I make mistakes, we are human beings,” said Capt. Amarinder, asking if there was anyone from the Opposition who could claim not to have made mistakes. “We all make mistakes, this issue is over now, let us concentrate on peace and on ensuring that the difficult times through which Punjab had been do not recur.”

The Chief Minister said his government had classified documents which he could not circulate in the House. “After meddling in Kashmir for long, the ISI had only one task now – to disturb the peace of Punjab,” he said, adding that Pakistan was blatantly trying to foment trouble in the State.

Showing pictures of Chinese drones, Capt. Amarinder said these had been seized from a man swimming through Raavi but there might be others that had not been caught. “Who knows what their motive is,” he added.

“What problem ISI has with Taliban, Iran or Balochistan, we don’t know. But what they have been doing in India is known to all. Earlier it was Kashmir, and now even Punjab is their target,” said the Chief Minister.

The Assembly also passed a resolution demanding the condition of mandatory passport and a $20 fee for devotees to be waived off to facilitate the pilgrimage to the historic Gurdwara located in Pakistani territory. Aadhaar card should be used to allow pilgrims, the resolution said. Members of the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party also supported the resolution.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/p6n8l2/article30776648.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AMARINDERSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kartarpur-corridor-will-remain-open-despite-security-concerns-punjab-cm-amarinder-singh/article30911869.ece

The commission’s chairman, retired Justice J.N. Patel, noted that Mr. Pawar has filed an affidavit before the panel and he would be summoned to depose, the judicial panel’s lawyer Ashish Satpute told PTI on Tuesday.

“A summon to this effect will be issued,” he said.

Mr. Pawar is likely to be summoned during the last phase of the hearing by the commission, the lawyer added.

Earlier this month, the Shiv Sena-led state government gave the “final” extension to the commission till April 8 this year and asked the panel to submit its report.

Last week, social group Vivek Vichar Manch member Sagar Shinde filed an application before the commission, seeking summoning of Mr. Pawar in view of certain statements made by him in the media about the 2018 caste violence.

In his plea, Mr. Shinde cited a press conference of Mr. Pawar held on February 18.

As per the application, at the press meet Mr. Pawar alleged that right-wing activists Milind Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide had created a “different” atmosphere in Koregaon-Bhima, located on the outskirts of Pune city, and its vicinity.

“In the same press conference, Mr. Pawar also alleges that the role of Pune city police commissioner is doubtful and must be investigated. These statements are within the purview of the terms of reference of this commission and therefore, they are relevant,” Mr. Shinde said in the plea.

The applicant said he has reasons to believe Mr. Pawar has relevant and additional information, apart from what he has already shared in his earlier affidavit filed before the panel regarding the violence and other related matters.

Mr. Pawar filed the affidavit before the commission on October 8, 2018.

The commission is headed by former Bombay High Court Chief Justice J.N. Patel. Former Maharashtra chief secretary Sumit Mullick is the other member of the judicial panel.

The commission was set up when the BJP was in power in Maharashtra.

Mr. Pawar’s party is now a key constituent in the Shiv Sena-led government in the state.

The former Union minister, in his affidavit, stated, “I would not be in a position to factually point out the chronology of the said events as that would be the domain of the existing law and order machinery.”

He also stated that he would not be in a position to specifically make allegations against any particular organisation.

“However, it is unfortunate that the State government and law and enforcement authorities failed to protect the interest of the common man residing at Koregaon Bhima and its vicinity,” he said.

Mr. Pawar further stated that the active role of “right- wing” forces behind the violence at Koregaon Bhima cannot be ruled out.

However, concrete evidence in this regard can be gathered only by law enforcement agencies of the State, he said in the affidavit.

Gathering of anti-social elements in large numbers at Koregaon Bhima indicated the failure of law enforcement agencies, he told the panel.

“Hence, the State of Maharashtra has to own the responsibility of a failed law and order situation on January 1, 2018,” he stated.

Violence erupted in Koregaon Bhima and nearby areas on January 1, 2018, during the 200th-anniversary celebrations of the Koregaon-Bhima battle.

The Pune Police have alleged that “provocative” speeches at the ‘Elgar Parishad conclave’, held on December 31, 2017, triggered the violence.

233,2020/02/25,Panel invalidates Solapur MP’s caste certificate,"Case to be filed against BJP leader to disqualify him from parliamentary seat

The caste certificate of seer-turned-politician and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Solapur Jaisiddeshwar Shivacharya Mahaswamiji was on Monday declared invalid by a district caste validity committee which directed that a case be filed against the parliamentarian. A copy of the order is with PTI .

The Solapur seat is reserved for the Scheduled Caste (SC) category. The BJP leader had defeated senior Congressman and former Union minister Sushilkumar Shinde in the 2019 polls by over 1.5 lakh votes.

One Pramod Gaikwad had complained to the validity committee that the MP, in his election affidavit, had mentioned that he belonged to the ‘Beda Jangam’ community, which is an SC. However, he alleged that the seer was in fact a Hindu Lingayat and sought a detailed probe into his caste certificate.

The three-member caste validity committee, led by Dnyaneshwar Sul, on Monday said the BJP leader did not belong to the Beda Jangam community and declared his certificate invalid and forged. The committee also asked the Akkalkot tehsildar to file a case against him in a magistrate court under provisions of the Caste Certificate Act, 2000.

Meanwhile, the parliamentarian’s lawyer Santosh Navkar alleged the committee was working under “pressure” from the complainant. “There is proof that wherever the vigilance squad went to verify documents, people from the complainant’s side were with them. We had objected to the reports filed by the vigilance squad and had made applications to replace the squad but the committee did not take any cognisance,” Mr. Navkar said.

He said the entire proceeding was carried out in a “hasty” manner and said they would approach the Bombay High Court against the invalidation order.

Lawyer Sanjay Chavan, representing the complainant, said the leader could now be disqualified as Lok Sabha MP. “We will approach the (Solapur) district collector and submit an application for further action,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/xel73v/article30909269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MH-BJP-MP-CASTEGBR75MJVL3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/panel-invalidates-solapur-mps-caste-certificate/article30910331.ece

People in Latur are facing a water crisis despite a healthy monsoon in 2019 with officials admitting that supply to home taps is now once in 15 days, with the situation worsening because of disconnection of the civic body’s power supply due to non-payment of bills.

Latur is part of the perennially parched Marathwada region and is Maharashtra’s 16th largest city, often in the news for crippling shortage which require the running of ‘jaldoot’ or water wagon trains for its five lakh residents.

A Latur Municipal Corporation (LMC) official said there has been no supply of municipal water for the last six days. He said the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) on February 20 disconnected power supply of the LMC due to non-payment of bills running to several crores of rupees. Due to disconnection of power supply, the LMC could not operate the supply mechanism from Harangul, Nagzari, Sai and Varvanti water purification facilities, an official said.

The Latur civic body pays around ₹70 lakh for power supply every month. “The electricity dues now stand at ₹4.19 crore. We were supplying water to five lakh Latur residents once in six days but this frequency has now worsened to 15 days. Efforts are on to restore power supply and arrangements (to pay the MSEDCL dues) are under way,” LMC executive engineer Vijay Cholkhane told PTI on Monday.

Mayor Vikrant Gojamgunde, later in the evening, said power bills of one month would be paid to the MSEDCL on Tuesday and water supply would normalise in the days to come.

“We had a meeting with MSEDCL officials. They too have not paid some of our bills raised for various civic works. We will pay the MSEDCL ₹70 lakh on Tuesday. Water supply to areas under the LMC will become routine soon,” Mr. Gojamgunde said.

The BJP is the largest party in the 70-member LMC though the Mayor belongs to the Congress.

238,2020/02/25,AAP has no future in Punjab: Congress,"Ruling Congress MLAs on Monday hit out at the Aam Aadmi Party in the Punjab Assembly, saying it “does not have a future” in the state.

Another Congress MLA Harminder Singh Gill said the AAP could not get even a single ‘Sarpanch’ (village head) elected in their constituencies after the 2017 Assembly polls.

Mr. Gill also claimed that the Congress-led government opened several smart schools in the state and they were even better than those in Delhi. “Almost 2.70 lakh students are studying in pre-primary schools,” he said.

Participating in the discussion on the Governor’s address in the budget session here, Congress MLA Raj Kumar Chabbewal said, “I want to tell AAP leaders that they do not have a future in Punjab”. He said the AAP was “convincingly” defeated by the Congress in 2017 assembly elections under the leadership of Amarinder Singh.

Chabbewal also took a dig at the AAP over infighting in the party, saying a few of their legislators kept sitting on their benches while others were in the Well of the House.

Except four AAP MLAs--Sukhpal Khaira, Kanwar Sandhu, Pirmal Singh Khalsa and Jagdev Singh Kamalu, other legislators were protesting in the Well of the House over Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta’s purported remarks on the Kartarpur corridor’s propensity to be misused for terror training.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/aap-has-no-future-in-punjab-congress/article30907412.ece

Aaditya, son of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, said the Tourism department was not given much attention in the last few years.

“However, the situation changed after I took charge.

Now, every MLA wants to do something for his district. The Tourism department does not have funds to cater to the growing demand. Therefore, I demand a separate budget, along with the main one, for the Tourism department,” he said in Marathi while addressing an event here on Monday night.

240,2020/02/25,‘Rare Artefacts’ exhibition in Kolkata aims to inspire awe,"Recording disc features flawless rendering of Tagore’s voice, century-old objects trace evolution of technology.

Tracing over a century of evolution of technology, the National Council of Science Museums (NCSM) has curated an exhibition of over 15 artefacts titled ‘Rare Artefacts’ in the city, which includes a vinyl gramophone disc used to record a rendering of poems and songs by Rabindranath Tagore.

It was in 1932 that Tagore had recorded the poem ‘Jokhon hobo babar moto boro’ and the song ‘Tobu monerekho’ in a George Newman disc recording machine that was imported from Germany.

‘First of its kind’

“This artefact was one of the first of its kind machines to be imported from Germany by Hindusthan Musical Products Limited. The equipment, which was in the possession of the company, was donated to the Birla Industrial Technological Museum (BITM) in the 1970s,” Rajib Nath, Curator of the exhibition, said. Mr. Nath pointed out that even after almost eight decades, the flawless rendering of the voice of the Nobel Laureate on the disc being played through an HMV gramophone at the exhibition drew many visitors.

The other exhibits include a hand-operated 16 mm movie projector made by Keystone Co., Boston, United States, in the 1940s, a stereoscopic slide viewer manufactured in Paris between 1900-1908, which provides viewers with three-dimensional view of images.

Jayanata Sengupta, Secretary and Curator of Victoria Memorial Hall, who inaugurated the exhibition last week, said that technology is so pervasive in human lives that people take it for granted. “This exhibition is an attempt to place technology in a historical context. Often, we tend to overlook the evolution of technology around us,” Mr. Sengupta said.

Oldest phones

The other artefacts on display at the exhibition, which is being organised at BITM Kolkata, include some of the oldest telephones, such as Bell’s electromagnetic telephone; wall type CB (common battery) telephone with detachable earpiece; and a pedestal type CB telephone, all dating back to the early 20th century, and a mechanical calculator from the 1960s. The organisers of the exhibition said that almost all of these artefacts are awe-inspiring, making people think that such were the top technological devices only a few decades or a century ago.

“These are technology-based objects that tell us about the evolution of how the technology of images and sound have evolved over not only decades but centuries. Since most of the visitors to BITM are students, apart from generating awe, these exhibits will inculcate curiosity among them as well,” Mr. Nath said.

241,2020/02/25,Manipur Class XII board exam question paper asks students to 'analyse negative traits of Nehru's approach',"Ruling BJP says it had no role in selecting the questions

The Opposition Congress in Manipur has reacted sharply to some questions in the political science paper in the Class XII State board examination. The students were asked to draw the poll symbol of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and analyse four negative traits of the approach of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the country, towards nation building.

Viral on social media

The BJP on Monday said it had no role in selecting the questions in the exam that was held on Saturday and the authorities concerned should be asked about it.

The two questions carrying four marks each, which had gone viral on the social media, asked the students to draw the poll symbol of the BJP and analyse four negative traits of Pt. Nehru’s approach to nation building.

Taking strong objection to the questions, Congress leader Kh. Joykishan had said on Sunday that the paper was an attempt to “instil certain kind of a political mindset” among students.

However, BJP spokesperson Chongtham Bijoy said, “We do not have anything to do with the selection of the questions. The authorities concerned framed the questions and they should be asked about it.”

Chairman of the Council of Higher Secondary Education (Schools) L. Mahendra Singh said that the questions were set by the Controller of Examination from the chapter on “Party System in India”, which was part of the political science syllabus.

Similar questions

An official, who did not wish to be named, said similar questions were selected in the past as well, wherein the candidates were asked to draw the symbol of the Communist Party of India and the logo of the United Nations.

State BJP general secretary N. Nimbus Singh said there was nothing wrong in the question on Pt. Nehru. Since the first Prime Minister of independent India had played a role in nation building, there might have been positives as well as negatives in the system under his leadership, he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8i3zep/article27009966.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKCBSEBOARDEXAMSTUDENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cong-irked-at-questions-in-class-xii-board-exam/article30908023.ece

When night falls Yercaud ghat road is dotted with tipplers. Two-wheelers are parked along ghat road and concrete crash barriers becomes tables for these tipplers. Besides this, they also manage to trespass into forest areas riding through a road a few metres before a toll booth on ghat road. The road, which pass through forest area leads to the backside of Kurumbapatti zoological park and a diversion on this road leads again to ghat road.

According to Forest department officials, the diversion towards the park was closed last year following forest fire. However, due to lack of checking at the entry point to this stretch from Yercaud ghat road, tipplers use stretch as a retreat and discard disposable plastics, empty liquor bottles and snack packets into forest areas.

A nature enthusiast, who do not want to be named, said, “since the entry to the road is few metres before the toll booth, there is no checks in the area and motorists drive in to consume alcohol and other purposes. Though, the diversion to zoological park has been blocked, some trespassers still manage to enter reserve forest areas. With onset of summer, any careless act by some trespassers could lead to major fire in the area.”

District Forest Officer A. Periasamy said that the road leading to the park was closed following forest fire in the area last year. Mr. Periasamy said that they would intensify checks in the region and necessary action would be taken.

243,2020/02/25,Effluents continue to pollute River Cauvery,"Untreated sewage and industrial effluents continue to pollute River Cauvery in the city as residents wanted the Corporation and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to take steps to prevent the river from getting further polluted.

Over 450 small and tiny units that function at R.N. Pudur and B.P. Agraharam areas near Kalingarayan Canal and River Cauvery failed to establish common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) and let the effluents into the drains that also carry the untreated sewage from households. The sewage channels finally enter the river at Vairapalayam and mix with the water that heads towards Pallipalayam and Kodumudi areas.

Residents in B.P. Agraharam said that industries usually let the untreated effluents into the drains during night hours. In the absence of underground sewerage system (UGSS) in these areas, the sewage channels directly carry the effluents and untreated sewage into the river, said Murugan, a resident in the area.

Corporation officials say that once the UGSS is implemented fully, the problem will be solved where as TNPCB officials say that they continue to initiate action against industries that discharge effluents into sewage channels even during night hours. They said that in the past ten days, power supply was disconnected to 15 units that discharged effluents into channels. But residents in these areas said that many of the units that were closed temporarily start functioning within 15 days and again discharge the effluents. “Violating industries must be closed permanently”, said another resident V. Balamurugan.

A day after the break-in into the branch of a public sector bank at Kallipalayam near Palladam on the Palladam-Dharapuram Road was reported in the Tiruppur district, senior police officers confirmed to The Hindu that cash of ₹18,97,000 had been stolen from it.

However, the value of jewellery stolen from lockers cannot be ascertained by bank authorities, officers said.

The bank was closed over the weekend. On Monday, bank employees returned to work at the branch to find that a window to the side had been damaged. After realising that a break-in had taken place, they alerted senior officials of the bank, who in turn lodged a complaint at the Kamanaickenpalayam Police Station.

A police officer said that the burglars had entered the bank through the side window. The burglars damaged the CCTV cameras inside the bank and took hard disks prior to stealing cash and jewellery.

Second attempt

This heist comes after a burglary attempt at the same branch four months ago. On October 9, 2019, miscreants attempted to enter the bank. The break-in then was discovered when employees returned to work after the puja holidays. “They entered through the same window and with the same method this time,” the police officer said, adding that no cash had been stolen in the first attempt.

Despite this incident, no full-time security guard had been posted at the bank premises. s“Some rural branches do not have security guards at all,” the police officer said.

With water bodies fast drying up due to increasing temperature, especially in the buffer zone of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), the Forest Department has begun filling water troughs to ensure wildlife in the reserve will have access to clean water in the coming months.

Officials said that due to heavy rainfall in the Nilgiris last year, most of the natural water bodies had enough water, meaning more ground fodder for animals as well. “However, with the intense heat since the start of January during the day, some of the water bodies in the buffer zone of the reserve have started to dry up, and so we have begun filling the water troughs as a first step,” said Deputy Director of MTR (buffer zone), L.C.S.Srikanth.

The officials said the availability of water in the core area of the reserve was much higher, and so there had not yet been a need to fill water troughs there.

In the buffer zone, a few water troughs in the Sigur, Singara and Masinagudi Ranges would be filled by the department to ensure that wildlife in the reserve would have enough water to make it through the dry summer months.

There were more than 40 artificial water holding structures built in the buffer zone of the tiger reserve, each having the capacity to hold anywhere between 2,000 and 15,000 litres of water.

A stone inscription belonging to the eighth century that was found at Brahmadesam village in Bhavani Taluk revealed that a lake existed in the area.

A team led by epigraphist Pulavar S. Raju along with researchers Sakthi Prakash and Veludaran unearthed the stone here recently. The seven-lined text inscribed on the stone was of Tamil-Brahmi and Vattezhuthu scripts that said that the lake was built by Serukkali Nadar in the region that was called Serukkali Nadu.

Later, it was called Vadakarai Nadu. The inscription revealed that the ruler of the nation was called Nadalar while the ruler of the village was Urali. Later, Nadalar was called Nattar. The inscription revealed that it was one of the ancient water bodies in the Kongu Region.

The lake was called Nattan Eri, its bunds Sirai and its outlet Vaai (mouth). The inscription said that the bunds were named Nattan Sirai while the outlet Nattan Vaai.

The researchers said that the names could either denote Lord Shiva or the names of individual leaders in the region. The inscription also said that the benefits of the lake should be enjoyed only by the kith and kin of the rulers and if not, the person, who used the lake, would not have children. Also, the inscription mentioned about the protector of the lake.

The researchers said the first letter of the inscription was in Grantha script which emerged between 5th and 6th century and found particularly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

“The inscription also says about the Sri Sholiga Arayan Aganithan Kulam, belonging to the same period, that was unearthed at Velliyanai village in Karur district,” they said.

Of these, a cow and five calves belonging to five beneficiaries from Panapalli, Dhumanur and Kondanur Pudur settlements died last week. The death toll touched six when the cow and calf given to R. Thangavel of Kondanur settlement died on Sunday morning.

“The cow and calf were not taking feed properly. They did not seem to adapt to the environment here,” said Mr. Thangavel.

R. Jothimani of Dhumanur settlement, whose calf died last week, said that the cow and the calf were not active since they were unloaded from vehicle.

Another beneficiary said that the cows looked old and suspected that they could be discarded cattle from dairy farms due to low milk production.

Joshua G.P.N., a social worker from Anaikatti, said that a few more cows and calves were also in a weak state.

“The tribal people feel that local breeds grown in the region were best suited for the hilly terrains. Also, they cannot afford cattle feeds for diary farm varieties,” he said.

When contacted, Meena, who procured the cows and calves for the Department on contract, said that all of them were cross breeds of dairy cattle such as Holstein Friesian (HF) and Jersey.

“The cows and calves were procured from places such as Namakkal, Salem and Erode at a cost of ₹ 34,400 for a pair,” she said.

Asked whether they were bought from dairy farms, Ms. Meena claimed that they were procured from farmers.

The Corporation had planned to tap the corporate social responsibility funds from corporates to develop the zoo. In this regard, it had sought a meeting with the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, said an officer.

The Corporation had proposed to develop the zoo under the Smart Cities Mission at ₹ 32 crore on a land abutting the Coimbatore Central Prison.

The Corporation owned around 45 acre – a stretch of land that abutted Dr. Nanjappa Road and Park Gate Road.

The official said the Corporation was looking to mobilise as much CSR fund as possible or at least one-third of the project cost to develop the zoo. But the estimated ₹ 32 crore was only for the development of the first phase of the zoo. The total estimate was around ₹ 80 crore.

Officials from Food Safety Department conducted raids at godowns of banana traders at Chinna Kadai Veedhi on Monday and seized close to three tonnes of bananas ripened using agriculture fertilizers.

Designated Officer, Food Safety Department, R. Kathiravan, who led the raid, said, “the bananas were found to be ripened using ethephon, a plant growth regulator used in horticulture for stimulating growth of the plants.” Officials have also seized over 10 boxes of ethephon from one of the godowns.

According to Food Safety officials, its consumption could lead to allergies and digestive issues. Officials found that ethephon was sprayed on plantain stocked in two godowns at Chinna Kadai Veedhi for speedy ripening of the fruit. “While the natural process would take about 48 hours, using such fertilizers would ripe the fruits in 12 hours and it is a not safe practice”, said Dr. Kathiravan.

According to Food Safety officials, close to 100 tonnes of plantain are traded daily through different markets in the district and there are about 60 major and small traders in the district.

261,2020/02/25,"Govt. presents supplementary demands worth ₹24,723 crore","With allocation of ₹15,000 cr., the amount for crop loan waiver stands at ₹25,000 cr.

The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Monday presented supplementary demands worth ₹24,723 crore, which includes ₹15,000 crore for the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Crop Loan Waiver Scheme, in the Assembly. This is an addition to the ₹10,000 crore sanctioned last week by the State Cabinet from the contingency fund, taking the total amount reserved for the crop loan waiver to ₹25,000 crore.

The supplementary demands are an excess amount sought by the government out of the budget provision.

On the first day of its first budget session, the MVA government seems to be continuing the tradition of the previous government of presenting supplementary demands worth thousands of crore of rupees. In the winter session at Nagpur in December 2019, the government had presented demands worth ₹16,120 crore. However, the present demands are inflated largely because of the crop loan waiver scheme announced by the government.

Among the departments which have recorded demands is Industries and Power Department at ₹1,476 crore, of which ₹1,417 crore is towards concessions given to power looms and consumers of agriculture pumps. The Public Works Department gets ₹1,477 crore, of which ₹434 crore is for major roads and bridges while ₹650 crore is reserved for the construction of roads under hybrid annuity.

The Revenue and Forest Department has been given ₹3,523 crore, of which ₹3,431 crore is towards the National Disaster Response Fund. Besides, ₹16.24 crore is allocated as financial assistance to the families of the farmers who have committed suicide. The Urban Development Department is being provided ₹679 crore, of which ₹103 crore is for Pune Metro and ₹375 crore towards subordinate debt of the State government for the same project, ₹210 crore to municipal corporations for putting in place basic amenities, and ₹185 crore to municipal councils as special grant for providing basic amenities.

Apart from the supplementary demands, the State government tabled a supplementary expenditure of ₹4,204 crore for 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. This is the extra amount that the government has spent out of the supplementary demands and the budget.",states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/lvf0a9/article30908109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMUDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/govt-presents-supplementary-demands-worth-24723-crore/article30908084.ece

The list was released by Mr. Thackeray and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar on the first day of the budget session of the legislature.

Mr. Thackeray had said that the first list on a trial basis to check the effectiveness of the system set up by the State government would be out on Monday. “We will pick two villages from every district and beneficiaries from those two villages will be announced. The second list will come up on February 28,” he had said.

Cabinet ministers from the MVA government held a videoconference with farmers from the villages where the names of beneficiaries have been announced.

Under the scheme, crop loans up to ₹2 lakh will be waived. Mr. Pawar, who is also the Finance Minister, said the State had received information of around 35 lakh crop loan accounts. Each farmer whose crop loan account has been settled will be given a certificate from the government.

In supplementary demands presented in the Assembly on Monday, the State has made a provision of ₹15,000 crore for the scheme in addition to ₹10,000 crore from the contingency fund, raising the total value to ₹25,000 crore.

Meanwhile, the Opposition, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), will be protesting at every tehsil of the districts on February 25 against the government alleging that it has fooled the farmers. “The MVA government had given the promise of clearing all loans against the farmers.

The Opposition led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis tried to corner the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over farmers’ issues on the first day of the budget session on Monday. Opposition legislators also raised the issue of rising crimes against women.

In the Council, Leader of Opposition Pravin Darekar moved an adjournment motion, but Chairman Ramraje Nimbalkar denied permission. Then the BJP MLCs raised slogans holding signs that demanded complete loan waiver.

Speaking to reporters outside the Council, BJP leader Ashish Shelar said farmers are in distress. “They have not received the compensation promised after the wet drought; their loans are still not waived. The list of farmers released on Monday is incomplete. Tomorrow (on Tuesday), the BJP will stage protests over farmers’ issues in every district of Maharashtra. We will also agitate at Azad Maidan.”

In a statement, Mr. Darekar said in the Council, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had assured that rain-fed farming would get ₹25,000 per hectare as loan waiver while irrigated farming would get ₹50,000 per hectare, but nothing happened.

“In the State, there are heinous crimes being committed against women like the Hinganghat and Lasalgaon cases. That is why, on both these issues, we wanted to move an adjournment motion to set aside other business and discuss these issues. But we were not allowed to speak; the ruling government is acting on vendetta.

264,2020/02/25,Innings win for Bangladesh,"The big victory ended a six-match losing streak for the host and handed Mominul Haque his first win as Test captain

Spinner Nayeem Hasan claimed a match haul of nine wickets as Bangladesh thrashed Zimbabwe by an innings and 106 runs inside four days in the one-off Test on Tuesday.

The big victory ended a six-match losing streak for the host and handed Mominul Haque his first win as Test captain. Zimbabwe, which trailed by 295 after the first innings, was all out for 189 in the second with Nayeem returning figures of five for 82.

Nayeem was supported by fellow spinner Taijul Hasan, who took four wickets as Zimbabwe lost batsmen at regular intervals after resuming on nine for two, although skipper Craig Ervine (43) and Timycen Maruma (41) offered some resistance.

Mushfiqur Rahim set up the win with his unbeaten 203 as Bangladesh declared on 560 for six on Monday, in response to Zimbabwe’s 265.

Mominul struck his first century as Test captain with a 132 and put on 222 runs with Mushfiqur to set the tone for his team’s dominance.

“Everyone did well, and I am happy for the team. We tried to put up a big score and we were able to get that,” said Mominul, who became captain in November.

“I don’t think it is a difficult start to my captaincy career,” he added. “Yes, we have to win more matches but we will do better.”

Taijul took the final wicket of Charlton Tshuma with his left-arm orthodox as the home side celebrated only its second innings victory.

Taijul began the victory push for Bangladesh on the fourth day when he sent back Kevin Kasuza for 10 in the sixth over of the morning session.

Nayeem, who claimed two wickets in the first over of Zimbabwe’s second innings on Monday, took the key scalp of senior batsman Brendan Taylor who top-edged a catch to Taijul at long leg for 17.

Ervine and Raza defied the bowling to put on 60 runs for the fifth wicket, but then Ervine’s run-out dented Zimbabwe’s hopes.

Raza set off for a single off Taijul, but Mominul broke the stumps at the striker’s end with a direct hit from cover point to end Ervine’s promising innings.

Mushfiqur took a brilliant reflex catch at mid-wicket off Taijul to end Raza’s innings before Tamim took another spectacular catch at mid-on to remove Regis Chakabva for 18.

Nayeem trapped Ainsley Ndlovu leg-before for four before completing his five-wicket haul with the wicket of Maruma. He ended with match figures of nine for 152.

Tshuma unsuccessfully reviewed a leg-before decision against him off Taijul to become the last man dismissed as Bangladesh ended its six-match losing streak in Tests.

Zimbabwe’s Ervine, who scored 107 in his team’s first innings, said it did not capitalise after winning the toss and batting first.

“It was nice to get some runs in the game but it was one of those disappointing games that we have to put behind us,” said Ervine.

“We probably just did not kick on from the start and we definitely needed more than 260 in the first innings.”

The scores: Zimbabwe 265 & 189 in 57.3 overs (Craig Ervine 43, Timycen Maruma 41, Nayeem Hasan 5/82, Taijul Islam 4/78) lost to Bangladesh 560/6 decl. in 154 overs.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/xfwzu1/article30915827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26NAYEEM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/innings-win-for-bangladesh/article30915828.ece

266,2020/02/25,"India vs. New Zealand | India needs to find answers quickly, says John Wright","Former India coach Wright says Kohli’s men looked rusty

Former New Zealand captain John Wright believes the Indians were “a bit rusty” during the first Test at the Basin Reserve.

He told The Hindu, “India looked out of sorts. It had two new openers and the middle-order found the going tough. It has to find answers quickly.”

Wright, a popular former India coach who led the country to a historic Test and ODI triumph in Pakistan in 2004, said: “The good thing for the Indians is that their ‘A’ team played in Christchurch recently and Kohli’s side would not be short on inputs about the conditions.”

Words of praise

Wright had words of appreciation for New Zealand captain Kane Williamson. He observed: “Kane has done enough to have the term ‘Great’ attached to his name. He has real quality and has the footwork and the balance to succeed in different conditions.”

Williamson is one of those rare batsmen who goes about his task unobtrusively, he said. “You look at the scoreboard and he is already 40. You had not realised he had scored all those runs. That’s the quality of a very good player.”

Wright noted: “And he’s also very humble, that’s very good for a player of his stature. Plus, Williamson is not even halfway through his career.”

Sharing his thoughts on Ross Taylor’s 100-Test feat, Wright said, “He is such a natural batsman, has so many shots. If you see his record across formats, he is right up there. Great contribution to New Zealand cricket over the years. And, he’s a good man.”

Wright shifted his attention to New Zealand’s destructive pace pair of Tim Southee and Trent Boult. “When the ball swings they can be deadly. It’s a right-left combination so the deliveries are coming at different angles at the batsmen.”

The former opener said, “If the ball doesn’t swing, they can find the going tough like we saw in Australia recently. But, for most part, Southee and Boult have been really effective. One of the top pairs.”

Asked about Jasprit Bumrah’s struggles in the Wellington Test, Wright, who has seen the paceman up close at Mumbai Indians, said: “He’s coming back after an injury. He’s finding his feet and rhythm again. It can happen to most players. After the highs, there is a plateau.”

Under the scanner

Wright noted: “Teams must have seen endless vidoes of him. Once you become the lynchpin of an attack, the opposition teams really put you under the scanner and look for methods to cope with your best.”

Wright said: “Sometimes, they just play you off, not give wickets to you. Bumrah is an intelligent person, and I am sure he will find a way out. He has to fight his way through such periods.”

And Wright continues to be affable. A true blue Kiwi, he certainly is.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/tzju3f/article30915682.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26KIWIS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand-india-needs-to-find-answers-quickly-says-john-wright/article30915683.ece
267,2020/02/25,India vs. New Zealand | Harnessing the wind is where Kiwis scored,"New Zealanders exploit Indians’ lack of knowledge of the intricacies of local conditions

In New Zealand cricket has a complex relationship with nature. Foreign teams fail to understand its dynamics and stumble in the process.

You don’t have to look further than India’s capitulation in the first Test at the Basin Reserve. The side did not make use of the conditions like the New Zealanders did.

Subtle variations

Take for instance the breeze factor. When the Southerly blows behind the back of the bowlers, the Kiwis know the ball will swing.

So when the Southerly arrives they pitch the ball up, get it to move around. The batsmen are lured into drives, and the swing either finds the edges or pierces the defence.

The Kiwis also know that when the Northerly blows, it does not quite encourage swing. The Northerly is generally a rough wind and it often blows across the pitch.

The ball does not generally swing and even if it does, controlling the movement becomes a huge ask. So this was the period the Kiwis bounced at the Indians and there was reward for them, too. They also operated cross-seam to flummox the Indians.

Trent Boult and Tim Southee are masters in these conditions. They complement each other and this time the Kiwis had Kyle Jamieson’s height — he’s 6’8” — off-stump line and bounce, to lend the attack more teeth.

Hunting pack

The New Zealanders hunt as a pack, with the fielders working in tandem with the bowlers. They stifle the run-rate, have men in both catching and single-saving positions, with just a couple hidden away in the deep.

Enter someone such as Colin de Grandhomme who can bowl over after over of clever and accurate medium-pace — around 120kmph — not giving anything for the drive, the cut or the pull.

And, as Virat Kohli admitted, the New Zealand bowlers enter the minds of the batsmen to make them play the way they want them to, building up pressure all the time. Once, the batsmen did that, they fell into a defensive rut and the trap.

The Kiwis were essentially playing a mind game, using the conditions, choking up the runs, and making inroads.

That Mayank Agarwal’s 58 in the second innings was the highest individual score by the Indians tells the story. And Kolhi’s men fell short of 200 in both the innings.

Worse the Indian batsmen were poor in their judgement around off. When the ball was pitched up, they did not use their feet to get to the pitch of the sphere. They were caught at the crease.

On surfaces such as the Basin Reserve — the pitch for the second Test at Christchurch is likely to be similar — a batsman, before entering the arena, has to be clear in his mind as to what shot he is going to play and what strokes he isn’t.

Unless a batsman can control the hook, this is not a shot he should attempt. Big drives through covers are best avoided. Patience, even while staying positive with low risk strokeplay, is the key to frustrating the Kiwi pacemen.

And when they decide to essay the bigger strokes, the batsmen have to hit with the wind, not against it. Here again nature tangos with cricket in these parts.

The Kiwi shackles can be broken with technique and intelligent strokeplay, not by brash methods.

Toss factor

Of course, winning the toss here and bowling first has its advantages. The Indians were unlucky with the spin of the coin at the Basin Reserve but until they work on the key aspects of their cricket and understand the conditions better, they may not be able to cash in on bowling first.

India has some serious issues with its bowling as well, particularly its inability to get past the tail. More about that later.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/i1v4kn/article30915633.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26INDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand-harnessing-the-wind-is-where-kiwis-scored/article30915634.ece

269,2020/02/25,Dhoni to start training for IPL-13 from March 2,"The IPL 2020 begins with a match between CSK and Mumbai Indians.

Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will start his training here from March 2 along with other players ahead of season-13 of the Indian Premier League (IPL).

The 38-year old Dhoni, whose future in the game has been a subject of intense speculation since the ICC 50-over World Cup in June-July last year, will start training at the M.A. Chidambaram stadium for the upcoming IPL.

The IPL 2020 begins with a match between CSK and defending champion Mumbai Indians in Mumbai on March 29.

According to CSK CEO K.S. Viswanathan, Dhoni will be training with players who are available as the full preparatory camp of the team begins on March 19.

Former India captain Dhoni is expected to practice for a couple of weeks with the likes of Suresh Raina and Ambati Rayudu among others. He would then take a break before returning, sources said.

Raina and Rayudu have been training here for the past three weeks or so.

Sources said it would help the veteran stumper to bond with the new players in the CSK set-up.

‘Thala’ as Dhoni is affectionately called by the legion of CSK fans would also look to get into the groove as he has been away from the game for a while now. He had commenced training with the Jharkhand team some time back.

270,2020/02/25,India’s batting was bit of surprise but they will come hard: NZ coach Stead,"The head coach also had a subtle warning for the Indian team, saying touring New Zealand could be as tough as playing in some of the other countries.

New Zealand coach Gary Stead on Tuesday said he was a bit surprised by India’s abject surrender in the first Test but is expecting a strong comeback in Christchurch.

India were all out for 165 and 191 in the two innings of the opening Test, leading to a 10-wicket drubbing in just over three days.

“It was a bit of a surprise but it was also due to the pressure we put on those guys for long periods of time. You get Trent and Tim to operate in our conditions and both were outstanding,” Stead told reporters on Tuesday.

“Trent’s freshness after being out for eight weeks added spark.”

The head coach also had a subtle warning for the Indian team, saying touring New Zealand could be as tough as playing in some of the other countries.

“We want teams to believe that it is as tough in New Zealand as it is playing anywhere else in the world. That’s a pride thing.”

Getting Ajinkya Rahane cheaply on the fourth morning was the clincher for Stead. After that, he knew that New Zealand would wrap it up quickly.

“Guess picked up wickets at critical times in the match. We got Rahane out and it was the catalyst of the belief,” he said.

India captain Virat Kohli had expressed a desire for his batsmen to come out with a positive approach, and Stead feels that a world class side like India would like to dominate the proceedings.

“I expect Indian batsmen trying to dominate more and that will be a challenge for our bowlers because a world class side like India will come back hard.”

Neil Wagner is back for the second Test after the birth of his first child and there is a possibility that the home team will go in with four specialist seamers in bowling friendly conditions at the Hagley Oval.

“That’s always good selection dilemma to have as Neil Wagner is coming back. Kyle Jamieson made most of his debut in the outstanding manner that he played. Neil will be back (in the eleven) with us without a doubt,” Stead said.

Asked if left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel will be dropped from the XI, Stead didn’t want to spell it out in as many words, even though that’s an imminent possibility.

“We will always consider that (four seamers plus Colin de Grandhomme) as an option after looking at the wicket. I don’t want to make assumptions but yes, wicket at Hagley (Christchurch) has a wee bit in it also.

“We have seen that guys like Colin de Grandhomme can be very, very useful on this sort of a track. Whoever gets a chance needs to put up a performance like the first game because India will get better,” Stead said.

Asked if the 60 points earned puts them in a good place in the World Test Championship table, Stead didn’t want to look that far ahead.

“Looking too far ahead would be dangerous for us. The next Test is only thing we can focus now. After this we play the next Test series in August. It is an away series in Bangladesh and completely different,” he signed off.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/3a5lga/article30911655.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GARYSTEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indias-batting-was-bit-of-surprise-but-they-will-come-hard-nz-coach-stead/article30911656.ece
271,2020/02/25,Grief and fury grip families which lost loved ones in Delhi clashes,"Head constable Rattan Lal too had a gunshot injury: family

Head constable Rattan Lal, who died in the violence in Delhi on Monday, was laid to rest on Tuesday in the presence of senior officers, including Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik. Lal’s family, which received the body at the mortuary on Tuesday afternoon, said he died of a gunshot injury.

The body was taken to Kingsway Camp, where the last rites were performed.

“He was ill on Monday. He had high fever. His wife asked him to take leave but he still went. What could he do, especially in this situation and when there are fewer officers?” Lal’s brother-in-law Deepak Bari said.

Mr. Bari said Lal’s wife received a call around 4 p.m. that he had been injured and was in a serious condition. “She then called us in Jaipur where we reside. We switched on the TV and news reports said he had died. We immediately left for Delhi,” he said.

Five of the other dead have been identified as Mohammed Furkan, Shahid Khan, Nazim, Vinod and Rahul Solanki. Outside the mortuary of Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital on Tuesday, families of deceased gathered to receive the bodies of their loved ones.

Hari Singh Solanki, Rahul’s father, a resident of Dayalpur, said he called the police control room around 3 p.m. after he sensed tensions escalating in the area, but no one turned up. “I called all the police officers whose numbers I had but no one turned up. My son died when he had gone to buy milk just around the corner. He was shot,” he said.

“We took him to a nursing home nearby; they refused to treat him. We wanted to take him to GTB Hospital straight but the road was blocked due to clashes. We then took him to a government hospital but he was dead by then,” the father said.

Mr. Rahul’s sister is due to get married on April 27.

Shahid Khan’s brother Imran said he got married four months ago and his wife is pregnant. “He is an autorickshaw driver and had gone to work in the morning. Around 4 p.m., we were informed that he had been shot. We found his body two hours later,” he said.

Khan was a resident of New Mustafabad and a native of Bulandshahr. Mr. Imran said their brother had got a WhatsApp message of the death in their village. “He received his photos on WhatsApp and called me. We went looking for him but couldn’t find him for two hours. We were informed that he was shot in Bhajanpura,” he said.

Subsequently, the family was informed that he had been brought to a nursing home close to their residence. They then went there and claimed the body. “We kept his body in the street for an hour not knowing what to do. Elders in the area then suggested to take him to the hospital for post- mortem examination. He was shot in the chest,” Mr. Imran said.

Stoned to death

Vinod Kumar, a resident of Brahmpuri, was stoned to death on Monday, his family said. His son Monu said they had gone out to the street when stones were thrown at them. “Nobody came to help us,” said Mr. Monu, who also sustained injuries.

Mohammed Furkan’s brother Mohammed Imran said he looked for his brother in GTB Hospital’s emergency ward for a while before he could find his body. “I asked the doctor if I could take him to a private hospital but he said he was already dead,” the brother said.

While Mr. Imran claimed that his brother was not a part of the protest, he was of the view that the clashes was “repeat of Gujarat model and not for development but for violence”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/xq93po/article30916428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26TH-FAMILY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/many-victims-felled-by-bullets-in-delhi-clashes/article30916429.ece

The Central Board of Secondary Education has postponed the Class 10 and 12 board examinations scheduled for Wednesday in 86 centres in northeast Delhi due to the violence that has rocked those areas for the third straight day.

Examinations will be conducted as usual in the rest of the city. The rescheduled date for students in affected areas is yet to be announced by the CBSE.

The decision has been taken “based on the request of the Directorate of Education, Government of Delhi and to avoid inconvenience to students, staff and parents,” according to a notification issued by CBSE Secretary Anurag Tripathi on Tuesday night.

While the board examinations began on February 15, the schedule has so far been mostly restricted to vocational subjects with fewer candidates. On Tuesday, none of the examinations was scheduled to be held in centres in the affected areas anyway.

On Wednesday, however, Class 10 students are scheduled to write examinations in English Language and Literature and English Communicative. Class 12 students have papers in Media and Web Application.

Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi tweeted that Mr. Sisodia had raised the plight of these students with the CBSE as well. The CBSE is yet to respond.

274,2020/02/25,"Delhi violence | Leaders making hate speeches must be held accountable, says Amnesty","There has been a deafening silence from the Prime Minister on the hate speeches made by the political leaders since December 2019, the human rights organisation says

The Amnesty India on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to unequivocally condemn the recent hate speeches made by leaders and demanded that they must be held accountable, as ten people were killed in violence in north east Delhi over the citizenship law.

Amnesty International India executive director Avinash Kumar demanded a prompt, independent and impartial investigation into such speeches that allegedly led to ongoing and past violence, adding that the “prolonged impunity” must end.

The comments by the human rights organisation come as tension smouldered in north east Delhi on Tuesday, with mobs roaming unchecked through the streets, pelting stones, vandalising shops and threatening locals.

Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kapil Mishra had led a gathering in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act at Jafarabad on Sunday, following which violence erupted between protesters and supporters of the contentious law.

“Political leaders in India who are fuelling hatred and creating a violent environment by making hate speeches must be immediately held accountable,” the Amnesty said in a statement.

“There has been a deafening silence from the Prime Minister on the hate speeches made by the political leaders since December 2019. The Prime Minister must lead the way and unequivocally condemn them,” it said.

Amnesty also pointed out to controversial speeches made by BJP leaders like Anurag Thakur.

“It is shocking that since December 2019, not even a single elected representative has been prosecuted for advocating hatred and violence,” it said. “It is the ongoing impunity that the political leaders enjoy which encourages them and other non-state actors to stoke more violence.”

275,2020/02/25,"Rise above partisan politics to restore peace: Congress tells PM Modi, Kejriwal","The Congress Working Committee (CWC) will meet on Wednesday to discuss the violence in New Delhi

The Congress Working Committee (CWC) will meet on Wednesday to discuss the violence in New Delhi, even as the party appealed for calm on Tuesday and urged the Centre and the Delhi government to rise above party politics.

“This is Gandhi’s, Nehru’s and Patel’s India, can any Indian accept this mindless violence? The Congress appeals to the people of Delhi to maintain communal harmony and thwart all attempts of the forces dividing the country on the basis of religion,” chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, talking to reporters.

“Our appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is: Can you rise to the occasion, leave aside your partisanship and views and become leaders not just of your parties but of society to restore harmony, peace and non-violence,” he said. “Do not fail this country just because you belong to different political parties.”

“There is no place for violence in Gandhiji’s India... Today, there is a need to establish peace on the ground and maintain brotherhood,” he said.

Former Union Minister P. Chidambaram, who handled the Delhi police when he was Union Home Minister, said people were paying the price for voting in “insensitive and short-sighted” leaders. In a series of tweets, he said the violence and the loss of lives were the “most shocking, and deserve the strongest condemnation”.

Mr. Chidambaram said the amendment to the Citizenship Act should be abandoned forthwith, and the government should listen to those who were protesting against it.

“India has lived with the Citizenship Act, 1955, without the amendment. Why does the Act need an amendment now? The amendment (CAA) should be abandoned forthwith. Even now, it is not too late. The government should listen to the voices of the anti-CAA protesters and declare that the CAA will be kept in abeyance until the Supreme Court pronounced on its validity,” he wrote on Twitter.

He said his party had warned that the CAA was “deeply divisive” and should be repealed or abandoned, but the “warning fell on deaf ears”.

Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel also blamed the Centre for the violence. “Govt of India sits mute as the capital of India burns. There is complete breakdown of law and order. Ineptitude and incompetence of this Government has led to houses burnt and lives lost,” he wrote on Twitter. “We urge Govt to use its might to bring peace to Delhi & bring justice on all elements responsible.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/r2te9r/article30914819.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RANDEEPSURJEWALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rise-above-partisan-politics-to-restore-peace-congress-tells-pm-modi-kejriwal/article30914820.ece
276,2020/02/25,Jamia violence: Court seeks report from police on probe into attack on students,"It also directed them to submit their case diary to show the investigation done against the personnel who had barged into the campus and lathi-charged the students

A court here on Tuesday directed the Delhi police to submit a specific status report on the alleged police attacks on students inside the campus of Jamia Millia Islamia University during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act on December 15 last year.

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gurmohina Kaur asked the investigating officer to file the report by March 20.

The court also directed the police to come with their case diary on the next date of hearing to show what investigation has been done against the personnel who had allegedly barged into the university campus and lathi-charged the students.

The case is being investigated by the Delhi Police’s Crime Branch.

On December 15 last year, protests in the area against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) turned violent. Four DTC buses, 100 private vehicles and 10 police bikes were damaged.

Police had said that they entered the campus while chasing the violent protesters who had taken shelter there, but the students had alleged they were brutally beaten up by the cops.

The court was hearing a plea filed by All India Students’ Association (AISA) secretary Chandan Kumar.

The petitioner has sought a court-monitored probe alleging that the investigating agency was shielding police personnel who had “wreaked havoc” on the varsity’s premises.

The Left-leaning student outfit’s leader has been named as an accused in the case.

Mr. Kumar’s plea, filed through advocates Adit S Pujari and Kriti Awasthi, sought monitoring of the probe “as the investigating agency, while shielding its own policemen who wreaked havoc in the premises of Jamia Millia Islamia University, has proceeded to name the applicant (Mr. Kumar), who is a peace-loving citizen/student leader”.

It also sought directions to the police to return Mr. Kumar’s mobile phone, which was seized by the agency during his questioning.

The plea claimed that Mr. Kumar had to unlock his mobile phone due to pressure from members of the investigating agency.

It also sought directions to the police to ensure that a fair investigation is conducted and appropriate material made available before any decision for coercive action is taken.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/biz7p7/article30913470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAMIAGRAFFITICAANRC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jamia-violence-court-seeks-report-from-police-on-probe-into-attack-on-students/article30913471.ece

At the meeting attended by Delhi Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik and others, the Home Minister urged the parties to avoid provocative speeches that could exacerbate the situation.

He also appealed to the public and the media to avoid spreading rumours and unverified information, also adding that unnecessary and unwarranted criticism of the police should be avoided.

The parties should cooperate with the police to check rumours and dispel fear among the public, Mr. Shah said, urging them to ask their representatives to hold meetings in sensitive areas.

He instructed the police chief to re-activate local peace committees, comprising representatives of all sections of the society, religion and eminent local persons. Senior police officers would visit vulnerable police stations and special officers deployed in affected areas, he said.

The Home Minister said the borders of Delhi with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana were under surveillance for the last three days and the Delhi Police were taking adequate steps, in view of the upcoming Supreme Court hearing on the Citizenship Law.

Among those present at the meeting were Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla, Intelligence Bureau chief Arvind Kumar, State chiefs of the BJP and the Congress, Manoj Tiwari and Subhash Chopra. Mr. Kejriwal also represented the Aam Aadmi Party.

The political parties extended all support in maintaining law and order. After the one-hour-long meeting, accompanied by Mr. Baijal and Mr. Tiwari, the Chief Minister told the reporters that the parties would take all possible steps to restore peace. He said the Union Home Minister had assured them of providing adequate security.

Mr. Kejriwal said one policeman was killed in the violence and 25 were admitted to two hospitals. Those present at the meeting expressed grief over the death of Head Constable Ratan Lal.

283,2020/02/25,Police response sought over plea on Pushkar’s Twitter account,"Tharoor moves court to preserve deceased wife’s account

A Delhi court on Monday sought response from the city police on a plea of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor seeking preservation of his deceased wife’s Twitter account and tweets made by her prior to her death in 2014.

Special Judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar directed the investigating officer (IO) in the case to file his reply on Mr. Tharoor’s plea by March 20, when the court will next hear the matter.

The court had last month dismissed Mr. Tharoor’s plea seeking to place before it certain tweets of his wife Sunanda Pushkar, saying he will have the liberty to produce them at an appropriate stage.

The former Union Minister who had got a pre-arrest bail, which was later converted to regular bail, was charged by the Delhi Police under Sections 498 A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code.

‘Loss of evidence’

In the plea filed on Monday, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for Mr. Tharoor, said Twitter may delete her entire account since she expired in 2014 and that poses a threat of loss of evidence in this case.

When an individual dies, “Twitter may delete the entire account, until and unless an order is passed in this regard. That poses a threat of loss of the evidence in this case,” Mr. Pahwa said “Since 2014, her [Pushkar’s] account is inactive. Give a direction to IO to write to Twitter India to preserve her account and tweets,” he requested the court.

The police claimed that Mr. Tharoor, the sole accused in the case, had abetted his wife’s suicide as he had tortured her. The maximum punishment for the offence listed in the charge sheet is 10 years of imprisonment.

Pushkar’s death had created a sensation as it came shortly after a bitter spat between the couple on Twitter over his alleged affair with Pakistani journalist Mehr Tarar.

Pushkar, 51, was found dead in a suite of luxury hotel Leela in Delhi’s Chanakyapuri on the night of January 17, 2014.

The entry of local and foreign visitors to Rajghat was prohibited on Monday ahead of the scheduled visit of U.S. President Donald Trump to the memorial of Mahatma Gandhi, officials said.

“We will lay a wreath and plant a tree at Rajghat in honor of this leader (Mahatma Gandhi) who is revered all around the world,” Mr. Trump said on Monday at a public event in Ahmedabad’s Motera stadium.

Those turned away from the memorial included visitors from Canada, the U.S., France, El Salvador, the UK and a group of 18 tourists from Ireland, who arrived on a bus as part of a guided tour.

285,2020/02/25,Jamia fake news: court rejects clean chit to Manish Sisodia,"Police told to file fresh report on tweets by AAP leader regarding anti-CAA protests

Rejecting an Action Taken Report (ATR) that gave a clean chit to Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, a Delhi court on Monday directed the city’s police commissioner to file a fresh report on a plea seeking registration of an FIR against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader for allegedly spreading fake news on Twitter related to violence near Jamia Millia Islamia during anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests.

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja directed the police chief to file the report by March 17 while rejecting an ATR filed by the investigating officer that stated “no cognisable offence is made out against Manish Sisodia from the contents of his tweet”.

“Manish Sisodia only tweeted his opinion on video clip, which was running on news channels,” the ATR filed on Monday read.

“From the perusal of complaint, it is revealed that the tweets are mere allegation against police and no offence under Sections 153 [wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot], 153-A [promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race etc.], 504 [intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace] and 505 [statements conducing to public mischief] of the IPC are made out. Sisodia only tweeted his opinion on video clip which was running on news channels and no cognisable offence is made out from the contents of tweet,” the police said in its report.

During the hearing, complainant Alakh Alok Srivastav opposed the ATR filed by the police.

‘Accused officer’

Mr. Srivastav has claimed that the Aam Aadmi Party leader took to Twitter to spread fake news by accusing Delhi Police personnel of setting a DTC bus on fire during violence at Jamia Nagar on December 15 last year.

“In December, after the CAA was passed, there was violence and unrest in south Delhi. DTC buses were burnt. There were pictures of some police officials pouring some liquid. Manish Sisodia, despite holding a responsible post, took to Twitter and without verifying it, accused Delhi Police personnel of setting the fire,” the complaint read.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ds925n/article30910084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24DELPRIYAMANISHSISODIAPC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jamia-fake-news-court-rejects-clean-chit-to-manish-sisodia/article30910085.ece

288,2020/02/25,Central Vista revamp: HC seeks Centre’s stand on plea,"Petition opposes cutting of trees for expansion and renovation of Parliament building

The Delhi High Court asked the Centre and the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) on Monday to respond to a plea seeking that no environment clearance (EC) be granted to cut of trees for the expansion and renovation of the Parliament building here, which is part of the Central Vista Redevelopment project.

Justice Rajiv Shakdher issued notice to the Ministry of Housing and the CPWD seeking their stand on the application moved by a Delhi resident opposing cutting of trees for the expansion work.

The judge said the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the Ministry, which is scheduled to hear the CPWD’s application for EC on Tuesday, can take a decision, but it will have to be immediately placed before the court.

The application was moved by Lt. Col. (retd) Anuj Srivastava in his main petition opposing the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building a new Parliament and government offices.

Mr. Srivastava, in his petition filed through advocate Ankit Yadav, has contended that the Delhi Development Authority does not have the power to bring about the proposed change in land use and master plan and only the Central government can do so.

During the hearing of the application, Justice Shakdher said that even if the EC was granted for cutting trees, the CPWD cannot go ahead and do it as the overall issue of change in land use was yet to be decided by the court.

Additional Solicitor General Maninder Acharya, appearing for the CPWD, told the court that trees cut for the project would be transplanted at a suitable location and if any of them do not survive, then trees of 7-8 years of age would be planted as replacement.

Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has won the consultancy bid for the Centre’s ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista — the 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate in Lutyens’ Delhi.

The revamp, which was announced in September last year, envisages a new triangular Parliament building that is targeted to be constructed by August 2022, when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/central-vista-revamp-hc-seeks-centres-stand-on-plea/article30908060.ece

Following the violence in north-east Delhi on Monday, former Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken not only asked Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to take a lead and “not sit back blaming others” but also suggested a number of ways to deal with the situation.

Mr. Maken in a series of tweets enumerated a number of ways Mr. Kejriwal could take in order not to appear “helpless”. He tweeted: “As a Chief Minister, please do not appear to be helpless. This would badly erode much-needed credibility of our democratic institutions to protect atrocity/violence against innocent citizens.”

The former Minister of State Home Affairs suggested that the Chief Minister immediately establish a helpline directly under his office to receive any complaints of police inaction or violence.

“This should be monitored and further passed on to the police and local SDM,” Mr. Maken said, adding that Mr. Kejriwal should call for an all-party meeting, take suggestions and work across parties to restore normalcy.

Further, Mr. Maken suggested Mr. Kejriwal to immediately form peace committees in all troubled areas comprising important social influencers from these places, including elected MLAs, councillors, District Commissioners, local SHOs, and SDM. He also advised Mr. Kejriwal to make each Cabinet Minister in charge of such panels. He also suggested him to talk to the Lieutenant-Governer on an hourly basis to take stock of the situation. “Please do these things and you would always be remembered as a Chief Minister who rose up to the occasion,” Mr. Maken added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/6wtjzs/article30908057.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26DEMAKEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/maken-tells-chief-minister-not-to-appear-helpless-and-blame-others/article30908058.ece
291,2020/02/25,"AAP appeals for peace, blames BJP for violence","Gopal Rai reaches L-G’s residence to talk about ‘deteriorating situation in Delhi’

The Aam Aadmi Party leaders on Monday blamed the BJP and outsiders for the violence in the city over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The leaders held meetings in the north-east Delhi areas — Jaffarabad, Maujpur and Bhajanpura — where the violence erupted, urging people to maintain peace. They blamed BJP leader Kapil Mishra for the violence.

‘Violence by outsiders’

Babarpur MLA Gopal Rai told The Hindu: “Now Hindus and Muslims in the area are going together to different streets and urging people to maintain peace. The violence was created by outsiders. The locals said they can’t identify the people who created the problem. It seems like a planned attempt to deteriorate the situation.”

The AAP Minister at 8 p.m. said: “Now, there is no violence happening but the situation is still tense.” He added that the police have already created peace committees and they will think about calling an all-party meeting but currently they are trying to calm the situation.

‘Panic all around’

Later in the day, he tweeted: “There is an atmosphere of panic all around in Babarpur. Rioters are roaming around firing shots and setting fire to things, but there is no police force. I am constantly trying to talk to the Delhi Police Commissioner, who is not ready to pick up the phone. I request the L-G and the Home Minister to immediately deploy police force.”

He also tweeted: “I, along with my MLA colleagues, have reached the residence of L-G sir, to meet him regarding the deteriorating situation in Delhi.”

Abdul Rehman, AAP Seelampur MLA, said he is holding multiple meetings with locals, “asking them to maintain peace. Things were peaceful and the protest was going on for more than a month. All this violence happened after Kapil Mishra came here and flared up the situation with his statements.”

“There is no problem in Shaheen Bagh but still our people are there and they are talking to protesters and others,” said AAP Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan, under whose constituency Shaheen Bagh falls. He said: “Right now, I am in Seelampur and we are holding meetings and asking people not to take law and order into their hands.”

Mr. Khan said the BJP was behind the violence and the police were giving them protection. “A person is seen firing shots but he is not arrested. There has been no action against Kapil Mishra, who is responsible for the violence. Action should be taken against him,” he added.

He added: “The minorities are 100% being targeted.”

Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister tweeted in Hindi: “I appeal to people of Delhi to maintain peace. Everyone suffers losses from violence. The fires of violence can cause losses, which cannot be compensated ever.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-appeals-for-peace-blames-bjp-for-violence/article30908054.ece
292,2020/02/25,Bidhuri elected Leader of Opposition in the House,"Badarpur MLA elected after Gupta proposed his name

The Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday elected Badarpur MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri as the leader of the eight-member Opposition in the Delhi Legislative Assembly, hours before its inaugural three-day session here.

Mr. Bidhuri, who was first elected to the Delhi Legislative Assembly in 1993 on a Janata Dal ticket, , according to the BJP, was elected the Leader of Opposition (LOP) unanimously after his name was proposed for the post by outgoing LoP, Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta.

Elected from Badarpur with a margin of around 4,000 votes in the recently concluded Delhi Assembly elections, this will be the 67-year-old’s fourth term as legislator.

“I would like to recall 1993, when both you and I became members of this August House for the first time,” Mr. Bidhuri said in his address to the Assembly while directly conversing with Speaker Ram Niwas Goel.

“I did not have the numbers... I was just one of four Janata Dal MLAs and you were a member of the then ruling party [BJP]... But the then Speaker, Mr. Charti Lal Goel, allowed me to lead a discussion on the issue of water. I hope the same concessions will be made by you for us, the Opposition MLAs, if the issue is worth the time,” he said further.

Speaking after the conclusion of the day’s proceedings, Mr. Bidhuri said the eight-member BJP Opposition would seek a detailed discussion on the “definition of a world-class city” with their colleagues from the ruling AAP, on a priority basis.

“We want a detailed discussion on the past and future promises made by AAP to the people of Delhi and especially seek to define the ‘world-class city’ which they claim they want to transform Delhi into,” Mr. Bidhuri said.

Sources close to the LoP claimed the party would also seek to ensure the election of an Opposition legislator as Deputy Speaker of the Delhi Legislative Assembly in the spirit of Cooperative Federalism of which, they said, Mr. Goel had assured the House during his first address after being re-elected as the Speaker.

When asked for comment on clashes between pro and anti-CAA protesters at Jaffrabad, Mr. Bidhuri said, “Whatever is happening in Jaffrabad is indeed troubling and very sad. But we cannot also rule out the possibility of this being done only to ensure that India’s image on the international stage is dented what with the U.S. President and the First Lady scheduled to visit Delhi tomorrow.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bidhuri-elected-leader-of-opposition-in-the-house/article30908053.ece

Fatima, a 62-year-old widow, could not hold back her tears when her source of livelihood was set afire by protesters in north-east Delhi’s Khajuri Khas. Her worry? Daughter’s wedding.

A resident of the slums near Khajuri Khas junction, Ms. Fatima sold fruits on a wooden cart for a living, which on Monday was set ablaze. The burnt and destroyed fruits lying on the street told a wretched story.

“What am I supposed to do? What is my fault? I don’t know or care about the CAA. I was not protesting. Why should I bear the brunt? This was my livelihood. Two days ago, I had bought oranges worth ₹50,000 and so many of them are now destroyed. How will I manage funds? It’s a big loss for me,” she cried.

Ms. Fatima said she was selling fruits in the morning after which at 2 p.m., a security guard asked her to abandon the cart and leave the area as the situation was turning violent.

“I went to my house, which is a few steps away from the spot where I was selling fruits. A few minutes later, I was told that my cart had been set ablaze. I ran to the spot and also fell down, injuring myself,” she said showing her bruised arm.

Ms. Fatima lives with her 25-year-old daughter, who recently graduated and a 23-year-old son, who is studying. The senior citizen said she has plans to get her daughter married and was looking for a groom. She said till now, she had been somehow managing the funds for her children’s education and this incident has left her looking for avenues to earn a livelihood.

AAP MLA Ram Niwas Goel, who was elected as Delhi Assembly Speaker on Monday, said that it was good for the democracy that there were more members from the Opposition party in the 7th Delhi Legislative Assembly.

In the 6th Delhi Legislative Assembly, there were initially three MLAs from the BJP and then it increased to four MLAs.

Currently, there are 62 MLAs from AAP and eight MLAs from BJP in the 70-member Delhi Assembly.

“It is good for the democracy that the number of MLAs from the Opposition party has increased in the Assembly. It is good that leaders such as Ramvir Singh Bidhuri are now a part of the Assembly,” Mr. Goel told The Hindu.

He also said that the Assembly would have to again pass different Bills which were passed during the 6th legislative Assembly as they had lapsed.

Core agenda

Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill and Delhi Swaraj Bill were among the top promises made by AAP in the 2020 Delhi Assembly election manifesto and according to the party, they had passed both the Bills in the sixth Delhi Assembly and later sent to the Central government for approval, which was not received.

These two Bills were topped the list of promises made by AAP in its election manifesto in 2015 as well. The party was formed in 2012 out of a fight against corruption and these two Bills were a core agenda of the party.

Channel for Assembly

“We have worked to make Delhi Assembly paperless and we will soon invite tenders for it. Also, like Lok Sabha TV and Rajya Sabha TV, Delhi Assembly should also have a channel.

Explaining why he took the oath in the name of Hanuman, AAP chief spokesperson and Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj, said: “It is a choice if you want to take oath in the name of your beloved god.”

Multiple references

There have been multiple references to Hanuman among top AAP leaders lately, with the AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal singing ‘Hanuman Chalisa’, a hymn on Hanuman, during election campaign and later stating in an interview that he would make the BJP leaders sing the Chalisa too, which he reiterated at a press conference.

On February 11, the day on which the Delhi Assembly election result was declared, Mr. Kejriwal, during his victory speech, said: “Hanuman has blessed Delhi”.

Last week, Mr. Bharadwaj had organised a recitation of Ramayana’s “Sunder Kanda”, which is on Lord Hanuman, and said that such events would be held in different areas of the constituency on the first Tuesday of every month for to seek Hanuman’s blessings.

Later on Thursday, he demanded that a statue of Lord Hanuman should be installed in Ayodhya and they have sought time for a meeting with the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust for the same.

“Bajrangbali has been helping us a lot. Bajrangbali is called the trouble shooter. We have found that whenever we are in trouble, Bajranbali comes to our rescue.

299,2020/02/25,"Blood, injustice and anger burn the streets of north-east Delhi","From the elderly to teenagers, mob roughs up all till police arrive after half an hour; officer blames violence on ‘rumours’

The main Wazirabad Road in north-east Delhi on Monday turned into a battleground with two communities pelting stones at each other, injuring several persons.

Metres before Khajuri Khas junction, members of the majority community thrashed those from the minority community.

The victims, some of them bleeding, were seen running for their lives.

At 4.02 p.m., a mob chased three members of the minority community — a boy who appeared to be a teenager, a middle-aged man, an older man. They not only punched and slapped the trio but also attacked them with sticks.

When the teenager tried to flee the spot, they dragged and thrashed him when the old man tried to save him. The boy then managed to run away after which the mob roughed up the old man. A few minutes later, they let him go. The middle-aged man, in an attempt to run away from the spot, injured himself.

At 4.09 p.m., a mini truck, driven by a member of a minority community, which was coming towards the 5th Pushta Road was stopped by a mob. The mob caught hold of the driver while he was trying to jump a divider and roughed him up. On seeing this, another set of people came to the spot and started beating the driver while chanting “Jai Shri Ram”. One of them said: “Maaro saale ko [thrash him]”. The vandalised vehicle was seen lying on the side of the road.

At 4.18 p.m., another mini truck driven by a member of a minority community carrying nearly 10 persons was stopped by a mob. As they started attacking the occupants, some of them tried to jump over the truck and run to the fields on the other side of the road but a part of the crowd caught hold of some of them and thrashed them mercilessly. A person started bleeding and subsequently ran away. This vehicle too stood vandalised.

A few minutes later, a few metres ahead, a mob stopped another car. They first slapped the driver, who with folded hands pleaded: “Mujhe jaane do, maine kuch nahi kiya [Let me go, I have not done anything].” The mob later let him go.

After half an hour of these incidents, a few policemen came to the spot on four two-wheelers following which the mob dispersed on their own.

As the melee raged, a middle-aged woman who was de-boarding an autorickshaw near Khajuri Khas junction, asked a reporter: “Should I remove my burqa and cross the road?” She then removed the black veil and walked on.

‘Show ID cards’

At Khajuri Khas junction, there were no police officers. Here, the mob stopped many vehicles, asking drivers to show them their identity cards. The mob at first stopped an autorickshaw and slapped the driver. When he showed his identity card, the mob let him go. “He was stopped and beaten by mistake,” said a person, a part of the mob. A policeman reached the spot and dispersed the mob. At this spot, a bike was set ablaze. A few persons standing near the bike said it belonged to a man from the minority community.

On this stretch, at least 20 persons from the minority community were beaten up.

A few metres from the junction, members of both the communities pelted stones at each other with a road divider separating them. The police here used tear-gas shells to control the situation. An officer, Inspector Vinay Kumar, went ahead and tried to pacify both sides.

Aman committee member Mansoor Ahmed said announcements will be made in mosques, asking members of the minority community to stay indoors and not to indulge in violence.

The locals and the policemen on the spot said violence erupted after 2 p.m. and blamed its cause on “rumours”. “Yesterday [Sunday], vehicles were torched in the Chand Bagh by anti-CAA protesters, which enraged many people. The clash broke out when a group of persons was coming from the mosque as others thought they were going to protest. Following this, both the sides got into a fight,” said a policeman.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4vhyn5/article30908029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24LEDE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/blood-injustice-and-anger-burn-the-streets-of-north-east-delhi/article30908031.ece

301,2020/02/25,"Now, Kapil Mishra appeals for peace","BJP leader’s statements aggravated situation, claims AAP MLA

A day after he set a three-day “deadline” for the Delhi police to ensure that the streets of Jaffrabad and Chand Bagh were cleared of those protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, BJP leader Kapil Mishra appealed for “peace” on Monday.

On Saturday evening, the BJP leader tweeted a video alleging that the main Jaffrabad road had been “occupied”, followed by another tweet, on Sunday morning, ostensibly showing a stage being erected in the area for the protest. Mr. Mishra later visited the area.

‘Three-day ultimatum’

On Sunday, Mr. Mishra had said, “A three-day ultimatum to Delhi Police – get the streets of Jaffrabad and Chand Bagh cleared. After this don’t explain anything to us. We will not listen to you. Just three days.”

Mr. Mishra’s appeal for peace on Monday, however, was followed by a tweet in which he alleged that anti-CAA protesters are running riot in Bhajanpura, Chand Bagh, Karawal Nagar, Maujpur, Babarpur and Jaffrabad. “Petrol pumps, homes, temples are being subjected to damage and arson. The situation is horrifying. The police should immediately forcefully remove them [protesters] from Chand Bagh and Jaffrabad. I appeal to everyone to maintain peace,” he said.

AAP’s Abdul Rehman, the MLA of Seelampur constituency of which Jaffrabad is a part, on Monday blamed Mr. Mishra for aggravating the situation. “All this violence happened after Kapil Mishra came here and flared up the situation with his statements,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/now-kapil-mishra-appeals-for-peace/article30908019.ece

303,2020/02/25,GHMC survey to identify the beggars in city,"Circle level officials told to complete the enumeration by February 28

GHMC is undertaking a survey to identify people engaged in begging for livelihood in the city, in coordination with other departments such as Police, NGOs and other agencies.

Directions have been issued to the circle level officials to complete enumeration of beggars in the city by February 28, official sources informed. The survey comes on the heels of the city being one among the 10 selected for the ‘National campaign for comprehensive rehabilitation of people engaged in begging’, with funding from the Central government.

As part of the campaign, a workshop was conducted recently with stakeholders where the participants shared the experiences and challenges in making the city beggar free. During the workshop, officials from the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment asked the GHMC officials to develop and furnish an action plan with physical and financial requirements by March 5 this year.

Following this, Commissioner D.S. Lokesh Kumar issued directions for constitution of circle level committees and preparation of action plans, based on the given guidelines. The circle-level committees will draw members from corporators concerned, police department, Traffic Police, She Teams, Revenue, Civil Supplies, ICDS, Women Development and Child Welfare, Health, Social Welfare department, Labour Welfare department, local NGOs and resident/colony welfare associations.

As per the guidelines, the beggars identified through the survey will be classified into various categories such as children, able-bodied, mentally ill, senior citizens, persons with disabilities, families and orphans. Those suffering from chronic illnesses will be provided medical care in coordination with the primary/urban health centres, area hospitals and referral healthcare facilities.

Need-based assessment will be done in terms of career counselling, access to education through bridge schools, skill training, and provision of entitlements to utilise the opportunities provided by the government. For the mentally ill, transit homes are to be set up at least one per zone, the guidelines specify. The officials should coordinate with the local NGOs right from the survey stage till completion of process for rehabilitation of beggars.

In order to sustain the campaign, funding possibilities should be explored, including CSR, departmental funding, community mobilisation of resources and others.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/na2fnm/article30916306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY26BEGHAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ghmc-survey-to-identify-the-beggars-in-city/article30916307.ece

305,2020/02/25,Two more metro trains to tackle HiTec City/Raidurg rush,"Number of short-haul trips from key stations also to be increased

Hyderabad Metro Rail will be introducing two more trains in the busy section towards Hi-Tec City/Raidurg to tackle the congestion being experienced by passengers especially during the peak morning and evening hours. It is also going to increase the number of short-haul trips from key stations like Ameerpet, Mettuguda and Miyapur so that more services are available during these times, said Managing Director N.V.S. Reddy on Tuesday.

“We are running 55 train sets of three coaches each in all the three routes of Red, Blue and Green Lines between Miyapur-L.B Nagar, Nagole-Raidurg and JBS-MGBS, respectively. Two more trains are undergoing trial runs and once ready for commercial use, these will help in providing more trains towards Hi-Tec City/Raidurg,” he told media persons in an interaction at the Metro Rail Bhavan.

Metro rail authorities have also requested the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) to allow increasing speeds from 30 kmph to 35 kmph. “We are likely to get the permission in August from CMRS and this will also help us run trains at a better frequency of 2-2.5 minutes,” he explained.

Currently, L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad (L&TMRH) is running 1,000 passenger services daily carrying about four lakh passengers — up from 780/800 services before the Green Line became operational earlier this month. Frequency of the trains, especially in the Red and Blue Lines, has been 2.5 minutes-3.5 minutes during the peak hours and during the non-peak hours, it has been 6-7 minutes. In Green Corridor the frequency is about nine minutes, said Mr. Reddy.

Short haul trips have been initiated between Mettuguda-Raidurg, Ameerpet-Raidurg and Miyapur-MGBS considering the congestion in trains during rush hours. Frequency of these trips will be increased depending on the emerging situations. All these steps should be able to tackle the peak hours rush and metro trains have been able to maintain the 99.8% punctuality, he added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/two-more-metro-trains-to-tackle-hitec-cityraidurg-rush/article30916135.ece
306,2020/02/25,Hyderabad gets two more Metro trains to tackle rush,"L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad (L&TMRH), which has built and runs the Hyderabad Metro Rail, has been earning ₹40 crore a month including ₹30 crore from passenger fares and ₹10 crore from property development, which enables it to ‘break even’ in terms of running operations and maintenance currently.

But, having invested ₹12,674 crore in the project, including about ₹12,000 crore loan from State Bank of India-led consortium of banks, L&TMRH has to pay ₹1,300 crore interest annually. Hence, it could take anywhere from seven-eight years for the project to break even, said HMR MD N.V.S. Reddy on Tuesday.

In an interaction with presspersons at the Metro Rail Bhavan, he disclosed that while the Centre had disbursed ₹1,200 crore from the ₹1,458 crore Viability Gap Funding (VGF) made available for the Public, Private Partnership (PPP) project; the rest of the money is yet to be sanctioned even though the Law Ministry has given clearance.

“Unlike other metro projects across the country built with Centre-State government funds with low interest loans from agencies like JICA - Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) of 1.5%, HMR was built with commercial bank loans taken at 11% interest and even now vested interests have been lobbying against the project preventing further funds infusion,” he charged.

The overall project cost is ₹21,000 crore since ₹14,132 crore is meant only for metro works, ₹2,500 crore was spent by State government for properties acquisition and utilities shift and L&TMRH sunk in ₹3,500 crore in equity and ₹2,243 crore for property development but it could spend ₹900 crore of the latter having used the rest for other works, said Mr. Reddy.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/p3ity5/article30919191.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-METRO-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ltmrh-earning-revenue-of-40-crore-a-month/article30916068.ece
307,2020/02/25,INCOIS launches three new advance warning systems,"All three products are free and will help in reducing losses for the users concerned

The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) has launched three new products for the benefit of fishermen, people living in coastal areas of South India and others, like the Small Advisory and Forecast Services System (SVAS), Swell Surge Forecast System (SSFS) and Algal Bloom Information Service (ABIS), for use on Tuesday.

All three products are available for free and will help in significantly reducing damage and losses for the users concerned and for authorities to make contingency plans for reducing damage, explained Head, Ocean Science & Information Services Group, INCOIS, T.M. Balakrishnan Nair, after the launch.

‘SVAS’ is for small vessels operating in Indian coastal waters warning about potential sites where vessel overturning can take place, 10 days in advance. Small vessels of beam width up to seven metres covering the entire range of beam widths of the fishing vessels used in all the nine coastal States and Union Territories can benefit from it. The warning system is based on ‘Boat Safety Index’ (BSI) derived from wave model forecast outputs like wave height, steepness, directional spread and rapid development of wind at sea which is boat-specific. The ‘SSFS’ has been designed for forecasting swell surges occurring in the west coast two-three days in advance as they generally catch the local people by surprise.

“Such events are intermittent throughout the year. ‘Kallakkadal’ is a colloquial term used by Kerala fishermen to refer to the freaky flooding episodes, UNESCO too had accepted this term for scientific use,” said Dr. Nair. During ‘Kallakkadals’, the sea surges into the land and inundates vast areas. However, it is different from Tsunamis as two different kind of waves are involved.

An INCOIS scientists’ study has revealed that specific meteorological conditions in the Southern Indian Ocean support the generation of long period swells which travel northward and reach the Indian coasts in three-five days time causing havoc in the coastal areas

The ‘ABIS’ is to help fishermen, fishery resource managers and ecologists get realtime information about the spread of phytoplankton blooms with details of species and size in North Eastern Arabian Sea, coastal waters off Kerala, Gulf of Mannar and coastal waters of Gopalpur. Harmful algal blooms are not only detrimental to coastal fisheries but tend to induce respiratory problems within the coastal population, adds Dr. Nair.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/incois-launches-three-new-advance-warning-systems/article30915708.ece

A National Centre for Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Startups of the premier industry body CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) to support startups as well as its members will come up in Hyderabad.

The facility will be supported by the Telangana government, by way of space at T-Hub technology startup incubator in the city, and Prathiksha, a charitable trust set up by Infosys co-founder S.(Kris) Gopalakrishnan, and his family. It will start functioning from April and on completion of T-Hub Phase II, being developed by the State government and set to open in July, shift there.

The Infosys co-founder, who is also chairman of startup accelerator and seed fund Axilor Ventures, said the centre will “support startups in all aspects, especially connect them with CII members which are some of the larger companies in the country”. It sought to benefit the members by getting them to know what is happening in the startup space, the innovations taking place and connect with the startups.

For the startups, the benefits will be in the form of getting access to customers, and a much larger market, besides mentorship and investment support.

“We are looking forward to providing a launch pad for overseas startups. We will be able to provide our startups access to overseas market,” he told the media later. On investments the centre will entail, he said it will be in multiple crore rupees. Support from the State government and willingness to work with the CII were factors behind the decision to set up the centre in Hyderabad, he added.

To benefit corporates

Noting that many cities were in the fray, Mr. Ranjan said the centre will be a “terrific facility for the startups as well as corporates”. The CII has 8,000 members and many more thousand indirect members.

Consul General of Belgium in Chennai, Mark Van de Vreken and T-Hub CEO Ravi Narayan spoke on the startup ecosystem in Belgium and Hyderabad, respectively.

City-based micro artist Mattewada Ajay Kumar, who is known for his miniature sculptures, has come up with yet another minuscule wonder.

He created a wax figurine of visiting American President Donald Trump in the eye of a needle. One can see the US national flag above the figurine of the President. The height of Trump’s miniature model is 1.25 mm and width 0.32 mm. The flag measures 0.94 mm in height and has a width of 0.64 mm.

Ajay Kumar told The Hindu that he had spent four days and 13 hours to create the figurine. In last October his micro-sculpture skill was recognised internationally. He won the first prize in ‘Art in a capsule competition-2019’, an international contest organised by ACG World Group, a pharmaceutical solutions and manufacturing company.

He received 5,000 US dollars as prize money in the contest, which witnessed around 80 micro artists from across India, USA, Latin America and European nations.

Mr. Ajay Kumar created a miniature sculpture of Dandi March — ‘National Salt Satyagraha’, in the eye of a needle commemorating Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary celebrations, on October 2, 2018.

In the sculpture Mahatma Gandhi could be seen leading seven men and women and that amazing work is now showcased at the National Salt Satyagraha Memorial (NSSM), which the Union government constructed at Dandi in Gujarat with a cost of ₹100 crore with the assistance from a design team of IIT Bombay.

Praise from PM

Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated the memorial to the nation on January 30 this year and expressed his amazement after seeing the miniature sculpture created by Ajay Kumar.

Malkajgiri Member of Parliament A. Revanth Reddy has alleged that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has “deceived” the people of Palamuru, living along the railway tracks in Bhoodevinagar Basthi in the Alwal area here, by promising double-bedroom houses five years ago, and his son Minister K.T. Rama Rao went to Palamuru (Mahabubnagar) on Monday to “deceive people there.”

Mr. Reddy visited the locality where about 350 families of Palamuru are living as part of his ‘Patnam Gosa’ (travails of urban living) launched here against the ‘Pattana Pragathi’ (urban progress) taken up by the State government to improve the living conditions. The TRS government had promised double-bedroom houses to the homeless poor in the city and elsewhere in the State but had failed to keep it as only a handful of houses were constructed so far.

He alleged that Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao, who visited Bhoodevinagar Basthi on May 20, 2015, had promised double-bedroom houses to all the homeless families there and assured to handover the keys within three months. However, the families continue to live without basic amenities such as drinking water and toilets till date as the Chief Minister had failed to keep his promise.

During an interaction with the MP, the residents -- Nagamma, Jayamma, Subbamma, Murali and others -- explained their plight due to lack of toilets. They stated that even water tankers supplied by the government stopped coming to their locality. The MP then announced ₹10 lakh funding from his MPLADS for construction of 10 toilets, 10 bathrooms and sinking a borewell.

“I will fight with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi and the Chief Minister in Hyderabad for getting houses constructed for you either under the Central or State government housing scheme as also for your other rights,” he told the residents.

He told the residents to start the work on toilets and bathrooms tomorrow itself, promising to send required steel and cement, and that he would visit again a week later to ensure that the work is completed by March 2, before the commencement of Parliament session.

He told the people there to drive away whoever comes to them, including the ruling party leaders, Ministers or officials, since they forgot the promise made for nearly five years.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cm-failed-to-keep-promise-on-2bhk-houses-revanth/article30907307.ece
315,2020/02/25,BJP seeks probe into Rohingya immigrants getting Aadhaar cards,"The issue vindicates our position, say party leaders

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday demanded a ‘comprehensive probe’ with a dedicated team of officers into ‘illegal immigrants’ obtaining Aadhaar cards and take steps to weed them all out, including the large chunk of Rohingya in the twin cities.

A delegation of BJP leaders led by party president K. Laxman, MLC N. Ramchander Rao and others met DGP M. Mahender Reddy at his office and presented a memorandum where they said that in view of the recent reports about over 127 persons securing Aadhar cards by producing false documents - about 124 turned out to be Rohingyas, the police should act expeditiously.

The party said the development “vindicates the position of the BJP” as it has been claiming for many years that there are several illegal immigrants staying in Hyderabad and in other places of the State, who secured Aadhaar cards, voter ID cards, and ration cards. Many of them have also been getting pensions under various welfare schemes too, the leaders alleged.

317,2020/02/25,Relief for JNTUH Vice-Chancellor,"High Court stays NCBC order

Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili of High Court on Monday passed an interim direction staying for three weeks an order of National Commission for Backward Classes that directed Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad Vice-Chancellor to appear before it on Tuesday.

The judge said that, however, the JNTUH Registrar can appear before the NCBC and explain the university contentions with regard to the notice issued to the V-C.

A faculty member of a private college affiliated to the JNTUH approached the NCBC stating that his application for faculty position was rejected.

Responding to his petition, the NCBC issued summons to the VC on February 13 instructing him to appear before it personally.

Challenging the notice for personal appearance of the V-C, Registrar A. Goverdhan filed a writ petition.

Hearing the plea, the judge said the NCBC is a body of recommendatory in nature though it was created as per the constitutional provisions. He sought to know from the petitioner’s counsel if the Commission had the power to summon a Registrar. Advocate General B.S. Prasad told the court that the Registrar can represent the university in such matters.

Giving an interim stay of three weeks on the NCBC’s direction for JNTUH V-C’s personal appearance, the judge said the Registrar can appear before the Commission.

In the petition, the Registrar stated that it was unfair on the part of NCBC to directly pass an order for V-C’s appearance without calling for any explanation from the university on the matter.

Referring to the petition filed with the NCBC by a private college lecturer, the Registrar said the petitioner’s candidature was rejected for consideration as faculty member by the faculty selection committee as per the rules.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/relief-for-jntuh-vice-chancellor/article30907285.ece
318,2020/02/25,Tractor ploughs into school building,"Cook-cum-helper dies, student injured

A cook-cum-helper was killed and a student injured when a tractor allegedly rammed the government primary school building at Ramachandrapuram in Madhira mandal on Monday afternoon. Sources said a speeding tractor ploughed into the school building located on the roadside in Ramachandrapuram in the afternoon. Lakshmi, 60, the cook-cum-helper, who was cleaning utensils on the premises of the school, died on the spot after being hit by the tractor. A Class IV student suffered injuries in the mishap. Around 30 students were present inside the school building when the incident occurred. They had a miraculous escape, sources added.

Driver was drunk

The tractor driver was in an inebriated condition and driving the vehicle rashly.

The injured student was shifted to a hospital in Khammam and his condition was stated to be stable.

319,2020/02/25,"Recovery on course, but road to freedom still far from sight","IMH awaiting formal nod to discharge 127 recovered inmates

“When will I be able to go out?”

Confined to the dimly lit corridors and a life behind iron grills, most of the 158 inmates at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) at Erragadda who have partially or fully recovered do not leave any opportunity to pose the question to doctors, nurses and other staff.

For some of them, freedom has been elusive for the past few months. For at least eight others, it has been over five years. In other words, it has been over 1,825 days that some of them stepped outside the ward, let alone return to their respective houses.

Little hope

With little hope of freedom on the horizon, they find solace by talking to each other about the duration they have spent at the institute and how they plan to get on with their lives after being discharged. Many have prepared a ‘to-do’ list which includes having their favourite dishes.

IMH Superintendent M. Umashankar said after a person is declared fit to be discharged, they write to magistrates requesting orders on whether the person has to be discharged on their accord, or handed over to their families.“We are awaiting replies to 127 cases,” he said.

When The Hindu spoke to a few inmates who have recovered from mental illnesses, they shared plans of how they wish to go about their livelihood.

Forty-three-year-old Padma Rani (name changed) from Warangal said she worked on the farms from dawn to dusk. “I used to grow corn, groundnut and chillies in our field. If I stay here for too long, I might lose that skill. I want to go out and take care of my sister’s child, who is an orphan,” Ms Padma said, adding that medicines are all that she needs.

Another person in the male ward, 40-year-old Subodh (name changed) said he and some others arrange sheets and blankets on patients’ beds, and do other odd jobs to keep themselves distracted. “I worked as a chit fund manager in Vemulawada before getting admitted here. If I go out, I will find the same work or learn some other skills if someone agrees to teach me. I want to live life outside. It has been many months that I had my favourite chicken biryani,” he said.

Others said they keep asking staff and the doctors about when they would be able to go out. “Please do something to let us out,” was their request to this reporter.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/78l28q/article30907240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY24-1MENTALHEALTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/recovery-on-course-but-road-to-freedom-still-far-from-sight/article30907229.ece
320,2020/02/25,Halfway Home stuck half way between idea and execution,"With zero headway in construction of the 150-bed facility, government officials scramble to make alternative arrangements as March 30 deadline approaches

A ‘Halfway Home’ for those who have partially or fully recovered from mental illness was supposed to be ready by March 30 this year, but it seems like a distant dream now. Construction work on the 150-bed facility has not even been initiated yet.

As per recent statistics, there are 158 inmates at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Erragadda, who are fit to be discharged but are languishing in the discharge committee ward of the institute for multiple reasons, which include reluctance of their families to accept them back or lack of clarity on their house address.

Days run into years as they continue to be confined within tall walls and behind iron grills round the clock. Their desperation to lead a life in community is hardly missable as they repeatedly enquire about their discharge with the staff, psychiatrists, nurses and visitors.

For those with little hope of returning to their families, Halfway Home would be an alternative to accommodate them. As a temporary home for people with physical, mental and emotional disabilities, the home is expected to help them learn necessary skills to reintegrate into society. They would be imparted skills to earn a livelihood apart from receiving mental health services as and when required.

On pause

In Telangana, apart from the IMH, there is no other facility to accommodate those who are declared fit to be discharged.

The need for a Halfway Home gained momentum when the Supreme Court, while hearing a petition filed by advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, directed governments of all States and Union Territories to furnish a roadmap for setting up the homes.

Following this, former Chief Secretary of Telangana, S.K. Joshi, directed officials in July2019 to chalk out a plan for the facility. Officials from Department for Disabled and Senior Citizens visited and selected a three-acre land parcel abutting the IMH.

A government order issued by the department on December 28 last year states that the Halfway Home would be established by March 30. IMH authorities had also written to Hyderabad Collector in January to allot the selected land for the purpose.

According to guidelines issued by the Department for Empowerment of People with Disabilities for setting up of such homes, a social worker, a visiting psychiatrist and a general physician and an occupational therapist among others have to be allotted for every 25 inmates.

NGOs to the rescue

With a little over a month left for the deadline to expire, even if the authorities choose an existing building for the Halfway Home, workforce, including social workers, have to be identified or appointed at the earliest.

Director of Department for Disabled and Senior Citizens, B. Shailaja said the three-acre land and a budget of ₹9 crore for the construction have been approved. However, since the March 30 deadline for the Halfway Home “cannot be met”, those who have recovered will be rehabilitated in the homes of NGOs, she explained. “We are in the process of identifying the NGOs,” Ms. Shailaja added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2r0gkc/article30907173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY24-INSTITUTEOFMENTALHEALTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/halfway-home-stuck-half-way-between-idea-and-execution/article30907176.ece

322,2020/02/25,Inadequate caution blamed for boat-ro-ro collision,"Inadequate caution on the part of crew of both the tourist boat and the roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) vessel that was operating in the Fort Kochi-Vypeen stretch resulted in Friday’s collision between the two vessels near the Fort Kochi jetty, it was concluded at a hearing of the incident that was convened by the Department of Ports on Tuesday at Alappuzha.

Officials of the department heard viewpoints of crew of both vessels and reached the conclusion. A report on the incident and the outcome of the hearing would be handed over to the CEO of Kerala Maritime Board on Wednesday, said a senior port official.

The boat Bay King was found wanting on half a dozen counts. Its driver did not have a licence as mandated by Kerala Inland Vessel (KIV) Rules. The vessel also failed to give way to a bigger vessel (in this case the ro-ro ferry), leading to the collision. It continued cruising till the Coastal Police intercepted it, despite suffering damage on its side in the impact of the collision. Even worse, its crew failed to provide life jackets to the 29 tourists on board, before and after the collision. All this may attract penalty like cancellation of registration.

On their part, the driver (who sits on an elevated position) and fellow crew members of the ro-ro ferry failed to communicate with each other while ‘reversing’ the vessel from Fort Kochi jetty. The collision could have been averted if a crew member had warned of the tourist boat approaching the vessel’s pathway. “We have suggested that they communicate through walkie talkie. Moreover, the ro-ro’s crew did not offer help to people in the boat,” official sources said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/inadequate-caution-blamed-for-boat-ro-ro-collision/article30916040.ece
323,2020/02/25,Probe under way into flood relief fund misappropriation,"Official suspended; police yet to register case

The district administration has begun a detailed probe into the alleged incidents of illegal disbursement of flood relief fund to ineligible persons.

The probe began after the District Collector received information on a few suspicious transactions recently.

Primary investigations revealed that a suspicious transaction worth ₹10.54 lakh had been made to the account of a cooperative bank.

The misappropriation took place from the fund that had been accumulated in an account related to the flood relief scheme, said a communication from the district administration.

Now, steps for securing the fund have been initiated. The cooperative bank has also returned the money which had been transferred to the accounts of ineligible persons.

The administration has suspended Vishnu Prasad, the section clerk, after an inquiry. A police inquiry had also been ordered, said the communication.

However, the police are yet to register a case.

At the same time, legal experts said it was a case of criminal breach of trust by a public servant. “The police should register criminal cases against the government official,” they said.

324,2020/02/25,Action sought againstoverloading lorries,"Trade union panel asks govt. to convene meeting of stakeholders

The Union Coordination Committee, a combine of trade unions comprising stakeholders in the goods transport business linked to the Cochin Port Trust and the Vallarpadam International Container Transshipment Terminal, has demanded stringent action against goods forwarders who overload vehicles and also evade tax.

A statement issued by the committee said the driver of the overloaded goods lorry had been blamed for the Avinashi accident that claimed 19 lives recently. The lorry carried volumes more than mentioned in the bill, the committee said pointing out that this was a regular practice by the vehicle owner.

The committee also alleged that there was a situation in which a few lorry owners cornered most of the transport business while others were idling. The situation must change because some of the lorry owners were quoting very low prices for the transport and, at the same time, burdening their drivers and crew with work.

The committee urged the State government to fix the lorry rates for transport business as per the 2018 study report of the National Transportation, Planning and Research Centre (Natpac).

The government should convene a meeting of the stakeholders in the background of the Avinashi tragedy. The committee said it would take the lead in holding the meeting and submit a report to the government.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/action-sought-againstoverloading-lorries/article30915360.ece
325,2020/02/25,Coronavirus takes its toll on tourism,"Large-scale cancellation of foreign tours from State

The cascading effect of the Coronavirus scare has hit Kerala’s outbound tourism market in a big way, due to large-scale cancellations.

While travellers have the option of postponing their trip by a few months or even a year, many tour agencies in the State are having a tough time due to rampant cancellations.

The ripple effect of the virus has affected tours to China, Singapore, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand and even countries in the Far East, said Rajesh P.R., a tour guide who frequently accompanies people on international tours.

“Many Keralites have postponed or cancelled tours to even countries in Europe, although the outbound travel season begins in April. Travel to Italy has been mainly hit, despite Venice, Milan, Rome and Florence being preferred destinations. This could be because of people in a few villages in Italy were being quarantined.”

He suggested that outbound tourists opt for travel insurance plans that provide good health coverage, since expenses even for minor diseases are very high in Europe. Many people opt for low-premium policies on the assumption that the tour manager will take care of everything, he said.

Most outbound tours, except pilgrim tours to places like Israel and Egypt, have been hit due to the Corona scare. Inbound tours to Kerala too have been affected after media reports of the government announcing a medical emergency following detection of the viral infection in three persons here, said Isaac Francis, director of a leading travel agecy.

“Travel agents stand to lose much, since a couple of airlines that operate mainly to South East Asia are not refunding the ticket fare. They contend that there is no travel ban to countries like Singapore, only travel advisory. But travel agents abroad are very cooperative on this count,” he said.

Most agencies were banking on travel plans of people to countries in Europe, despite the scare in parts of Italy, Mr. Francis said.

A combination of factors has been hammering the travel industry one by one since the past few years, said a travel operator. “Demonetisation, floods in Kerala, GST issues and rescheduling of flights due to re-carpeting of the Cochin airport runway have caused the stalemate. On their part, investors are not investing due to the uncertainty that is clouding the sector,” he said.

People fear to travel in closed spaces for fear of the possibility of infected co-travellers, he added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/coronavirus-takes-its-toll-on-tourism/article30915346.ece
326,2020/02/25,Fishers demand open market kerosene sale,"Sharp fall in supply of subsidised kerosene

Fishers have demanded that the State government intervene to make non-subsidised kerosene available in the open market at affordable price to curb their exploitation by unscrupulous elements.

Demand for kerosene in the open market for fishing activities has gone up against the background of a sharp fall in the supply of subsidised kerosene. The shortage in the market is exploited by elements that corner public supplies to sell the commodity at a premium to fishermen who are badly in need of the fuel, said Charles George of Matsya Thozhilai Aikyavedi.

To end this practice, fishers raised the demand that kerosene be made available in the open market by a government agency, which can also fix the points of sale so that fishermen are not exploited.

The demand was raised at a meeting of fishers’ unions last week with Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma and the government had taken the suggestion positively, Mr. Charles said.

Sources in the apex fisheries cooperative, Matsyafed, said that with marine fisheries passing through a near-fish-drought, kerosene offtake had slowed down to some extent.

Mr. Charles reiterated that the unprecedented fall in catch, especially of pelagic varieties like anchovies, Indian mackerel and oil sardines, called for a package for the fishermen who were now in dire straits. Even if the government was not ready to come out with a financial package for the fishing community, it should at least make sure that affordable kerosene was made available, he said.

Around 38,000 fishing engines in the State required kerosene for their operations. Matsyafed has been supplying up to 140 litres of subsidised kerosene a month to engines of up to 10 HP. Engines with power ranging between 10 HP and 15 HP are provided with 1,508 litres and engines up to 40 HP are given with 190 litres monthly.

Verification

Meanwhile, the Fisheries Department has fixed March 15 as the date for verification of the boats and fishing vessels that require subsidised kerosene supply.

There are around 200 boats that are eligible for subsidised kerosene in the district. However, only 100 to 150 have been availing the fuel due to the sharp fall in fish catch in recent months.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/fishers-demand-open-market-kerosene-sale/article30914980.ece
327,2020/02/25,Fresh norms to ensure safe cruising on Kochi backwaters,"Move in the wake of collision between ro-ro vessel and tourist boat

The Ports Department will publish fresh safety norms to ensure the safe operation of tourist boats in the backwaters off Kochi, in the wake of Friday’s collision between a roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) vessel that was operating in the Fort Kochi-Vypeen route and a tourist boat.

This would be done on the basis of a hearing that the department has convened at Alappuzha, to listen to the viewpoints of stakeholders, including the sranks (drivers) of both vessels. Officials of Kerala Maritime Board (KMB) too would participate in the hearing. This would shortly be followed by a meeting with representatives of tourist boat operators based at Marine Drive, Ernakulam District Tourism Promotion Council, district administration, police etc., said sources in the Ports Department.

Friday’s collision exposed safety chinks involved in boat operation in the Kochi backwaters. The tourist boat’s driver did not have the mandatory licence issued by the Ports Department. The boat also failed to steer clear of the ro-ro vessel which had the ‘right of way’ on the corridor. The driver also failed to berth the vessel after the collision, despite damage to one side.

On its part, it was found that communication between the ro-ro driver seated at an elevation and crew on the deck was inadequate. This could be solved if walkie talkies were relied on for intra-vessel communication between the driver and lascars. This would do away with relying only on CCTV camera, while reversing from the jetty, he said.

The new norms would be applicable to around 400 tourist vessels, including speed boats, which operate in Ernakulam, Alappuzha and Idukki districts. A good share of them operate from Marine Drive, it is learnt.

In the meantime, sources in Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC), which operates two ro-ro ferries from Fort Kochi, said that they would submit a memorandum to the Director of Kerala Tourism, apprising him of the safety risks involved in tourist vessels crossing the pathway of ferries which operate every five minutes in the corridor.

On its part, the Greater Cochin Development Authority, which owns the Marine Drive waterfront, has failed to take action against tourist boat operators who have installed a dozen ramshackle wooden jetties, despite the safety hazard they pose to tourists.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ujg9cp/article30914306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26KIBOAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/fresh-norms-to-ensure-safe-cruising-on-kochi-backwaters/article30914307.ece
328,2020/02/25,A Kochi doctor’s battle for gender equality,"Sameera M. Jahagirdar stresses the need to restructure MBBS curriculum

Sameera M. Jahagirdar is now going to take her fight for the rights of LGBT+ to the Medical Council of India, which has not yet recognised the need to restructure the MBBS curriculum in which the textbooks continue to criminalise a transgender or a homosexual or anyone who does not fall within the two-gender sexual orientations of society.

Her journey as a woman trapped in a man’s body and taking up the medical profession to unravel the biological enigma of the human body was one of continuous trauma. The fight within herself to realise her sexual orientation leading later to gender identity and with society’s unrelenting stand on homosexuality and transgender was too much to handle as she had no one to talk to about what she was going through.

“I used to internalise everything that it damaged my psyche,” said Dr. Jahagirdar, Assistant Professor, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute, Puducherry. At one stage she decided to run away from Pune, her native place, seeking a life that would help her live her life the way she saw it.

“I had turned to medicine hoping that learning the human biology threadbare would provide some answers. But, no, she said. All the medical texts were very harsh on homosexuality. This increased my sense of isolation in society, many times even contemplating and attempting suicide.”

It was much later while working at JIPMER, going through medical literature in the institute’s library, she realised that her sexual orientation was not a disorder. The American Psychiatric Society had done some good work in the field in the 1970s, she said.

That was in 2003 and she stopped running away from her own self thereafter. But, then, to actually take the sex reassignment surgery, it took about 13 years. The battle was only half won with herself at that time. The society at large still was the same.

Backed by the Supreme Court’s ruling on creating space for another gender, Dr. Jahagirdar began her advocacy in the institution where she works. “It was an uphill task, but I got positive responses from the staff and colleagues, which was a beginning in itself.”

Her work was recognised by Annamalai University that conducted a meeting on the nursing curriculum board of studies. The National Health Mission, Tamil Nadu, appreciated her work in establishing gender affirmative procedures and building a dedicated multi-disciplinary team.

“My educational qualifications have given me the rights to live with dignity in the institution. However, the society outside the walls of my workspace continues to be harsh. When I found that people were not ready to give me house on rent, I thought of buying an apartment. But even for that, I had to rely on my partner to get the work done in my name,” said Dr. Jahagirdar.

Media’s role in giving space to all genders had been much appreciated, she added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/5gjpnm/article30909916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG3910,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/a-kochi-doctors-battle-for-gender-equality/article30909917.ece
329,2020/02/25,News team alleges attack by Twenty20 members,"They were at Kizhakkambalam panchayat office on a reporting assignment

Tension prevailed at the Kizhakkambalam panchayat office on Monday afternoon when a reporter and a cameraman from a media organisation were allegedly illegally restrained, manhandled and verbally abused by a group led by the panchayat president and a member.

The situation was defused following the intervention of Kunnathunadu police, who registered cases against both parties.

Multimedia producer Ria Mathews and cameraman Rahil Hari of Asiaville Malayalam had gone to the panchayat office to cover development activities undertaken by the local body governed by Twenty20, a corporate-backed charity outfit.

As per the reporter’s police petition, a group of around 20 persons led by panchayat president Jincy Aji and member Hafiz Hydrose heckled them when they interviewed K.V. Jacob, a panchayat member who recently stepped down as president in the face of a no-confidence motion moved by the ruling outfit.

330,2020/02/25,Colour code for contract carriage vehicles welcomed,"Safety concerns as many buses sport flashy colours, images

The State Transport Authority’s (STA) decision to usher in a uniform colour code for contract carriage vehicles from March 1 has largely been welcomed, considering the levels to which many bus operators went to woo commuters at the cost of safety.

The government intervention came in the wake of most buses exhibiting flashy colours and graphics with larger-than-life images of film actors or sportspersons.

The High Court of Kerala too had ordered a clampdown on such images and wordings on body and glasses of vehicles in October 2019.

New norms

The STA has mandated that all newly-registered buses sport white colour with a violet and metallic-gold ribbon running through the body. The vehicle’s name, if any, may be painted on the top front side in normal font, with the size not exceeding 12 inches. The operator’s name and other details may be painted on the rear side. The colour code will take effect from the time of renewing certificate of fitness, for older vehicles.

“It will bring about uniformity for all contract-carriage vehicles, just like for city-permit, mofussil and long-distance buses. Many operators used to opt for flashy shades and images, without seeking the mandatory permission from the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) and entering the same in registration certificate,” said Titus Etturuthil, who operates a fleet of contract carriage buses. On the flip side, people would find it difficult to identify their vehicles by name or registration number, when buses or other contract carriage vehicles are parked together at tourist locales or pilgrimage spots, he added.

A senior MVD official said the STA was forced to issue the guidelines since many tourist buses and vans were flouting safety norms, by opting for flashy colours and names to woo the youth. “They also flaunted very flashy lights [including psychedelic ones] on the exterior and interior and installed high-decibel audio systems, diverting the attention of other road users, often causing accidents.”

While welcoming the new guidelines, another MVD official said operators should be given some leeway so that their vehicles stood out from the crowd. Simultaneously, rule enforcement must be stepped up, so that they do not opt for unhealthy practices. “It goes without saying that bus operators invited this action by their unruly conduct,” he added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/quqmcl/article30907906.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24KIBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/colour-code-for-contract-carriage-vehicles-welcomed/article30907907.ece
331,2020/02/25,Geotextile tube works to resume in Chellanam,"Four coastal stretches battered by rough seas during high tide, heavy rain

After a gap of nearly a year, work on erecting geotextile tubes as shore protection structures in Chellanam panchayat will resume any time now with the contract for the project being awarded to a Kochi-based company on the basis of negotiated quotation.

A senior official of the Irrigation Department said here on Monday that work order for the project would be placed soon after the quotation was settled through negotiation. Since there were no takers for the sea wall project when tenders were floated, the work was awarded on the basis of negotiation, the official added.

The project involves erecting sea walls using geotextile tubes filled with sand along the Velankanni, Companyppadi, Vachakkal and Bazaar coast to prevent sea incursion.

The four coastal stretches have been identified as the most vulnerable in Chellanam panchayat and the areas have been regularly battered by rough seas during high tide and heavy rains. The situation had become more dangerous for the more than 30 families along the coast in the panchayat after Cyclone Ockhi hit the shores in December 2017. Since then efforts have been under way to erect a sea wall as a shore proection measure. However, the lack of availability of conventional granite boulders prompted the authorities to look for new ideas. Use of geotextile tubes filled with sand for establishing several stretches of sea wall was suggested as an alternative.

Paschima Kochi Theera Samrakshana Samiti has been demanding immediate action. V. Jinson, a member of the Samiti, said the contractor had not been able to complete the work and the award was cancelled to be re-tendered again.

332,2020/02/25,"LPG terminal work has resumed with State support, says IOC","Work on ₹2,200-crore project suspended in February 2017 following protests

Work on the cooking gas import terminal and storage facility on Puthuvype island, being established by Indian Oil Corporation, has resumed in right earnest after the State government intervention in December last year.

Work on the ₹2,200-crore project was suspended on February 16, 2017 following protests by people residing near the site. Work resumed amid tight police security in December. Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) is still in force around the project site to enable the work to continue uninterrupted.

IOC chief general manager and State head V.C. Asokan on Monday said that the work had resumed with State support. He was speaking to reporters here on IOC performance in the State during the current financial year.

While the local people have expressed fear over the safety of the installations, IOC has maintained that the most advanced safety standards are being followed in the implementation of the project. The terminal and storage facilities are designed to be among the safest and most environment friendly installations, IOC has said. Mr. Asokan said IOC played a dominant role in the Kerala LPG market with a sale of 4.21 lakh tonnes of gas per year, which was 48% of the market.

Cooking gas sale by IOC was expected to exceed five lakh tonnes during the year, he said. Eight new Indane distributions were set up during the current year. There are a total of 337 Indane distributors in the State, catering for around 51.8 lakh consumers.

The IOC official also said that the company had deployed emergency rescue vehicles in Kochi, Kollam and Kozhikode cooking gas bottling plants to attend to any LPG-related emergency and petroleum fuel-related road accidents.

Pipelines

Construction of the Kochi-Salem pipeline from Puthuvype LPG facility and Kochi refinery premises for supply to Palakkad and Salem is under way. The pipeline will help take away a large number of bullet gas tankers off the national highway between Kochi and the northern destinations.

The pipeline will also cater to the requirements of the LPG bottling plants at Palakkad and Coimbatore, Erode and Salem, operated both by BPCL and IOC. The pipeline has connectivity to the Udayamperoor bottling plant. The estimated cost of the project is ₹1,112 crore and the total length is 458 km.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/cr6syv/article30907847.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24KIIOCPUTHUVYPE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/lpg-terminal-work-has-resumed-with-state-support-says-ioc/article30907848.ece
333,2020/02/25,"The Madras Players’ Trinity, is set to tour the US and Canada","Trinity, a blend of theatre and live classical music features tales of the giants of Carnatic music

One of the stalwarts of the Carnatic music universe, Muthuswami Dikshitar, used to travel from kshetram to kshetram with his band of disciples and composed songs impromptu. Which is why many of his songs talk extensively of temple architecture, different deities, and other such observations. Nuggets of lesser known historical facts like this are what make up writer Seetha Ravi’s fictional world featuring the trinity of Carnatic music — Thyagaraja Swamy, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Sastry — in the form of short stories. It is in November 2018 that these interconnected worlds, under the translation of Prabha Sridevan, took to stage in the form of theatre interspersed with live Carnatic music, in a show titled Trinity. And now, The Madras Players’ Trinity, a PC Ramakrishna directorial, is all set to tour the US and Canada over the months of March and April.

“I had initially read Seetha Ravi’s stories translated by Prabha Sridevan in The Hindu Sunday Magazine, in 2017 over three consecutive Sundays,” recalls Ramakrishna, who went on to devise them into a single narrative that gives a glimpse into each of these musicians’ lives. The stories, in fact, were capable of lending a different experience because they combined starkly different performing art genres — live Carnatic music and drama, according to the director. It pushed the possibilities of musical theatre further. The decision to cast Carnatic musicians in major roles was another experiment that worked in the play’s favour. “And, these are musicians who have their own devout following in the music circle. We have Vijay Siva playing Muthuswami Dikshitar, Gayathri Venkataraghavan as Lalitha (wife of Shyama Sastri) and S Sunder as Thyagaraja,” says the director.

After a successful run in Chennai in November 2018, Trinity went on to be staged multiple times in different venues in the city and in Hyderabad. “During the Margazhi season, a lot of people who belong to the Indian diaspora felt that the play would work well, especially for the second and third generation of the Indian diaspora abroad,” says Ramakrishna, adding that a lot of children from younger generations are training in Carnatic music and other classical performing arts, especially in the US. And since the play is in English, it becomes all the more accessible for all kinds of audience. “We got a lot of feedback saying the English didn’t seem out of place. Language did not become an impediment, and this contributed largely to the success of the show,” adds Ramakrishna.

Interestingly, Ramakrishna has been directing five non-singing local actors from each of the cities they will tour, through Skype, over the last three months. They will be integrated with the team once they reach the city. “It was a novel exercise for me,” he says. “Owing to financial constraints, we are unable to take the entire cast. We are travelling with six major singers and four other characters from India, and have sourced two singers from the US who will travel with the group,” he says, adding that this has been an exciting exercise, a first for The Madras Players.

The play, on the whole, has not been tweaked in any way. However, more songs and content have been added to extend the play by 30 minutes, making it two hours and five minutes long. “In the US, the norm is two hours, and we had also realised that the songs have many takers,” says Ramkrishna. In addition, more recorded history about the stalwarts has been added to the narrative. Though the stories are different, they are woven together by a sutradhara who travels through them. While sometimes he is a part of the story; sometimes he is not. However, the most fascinating fact that ties all three together is: “All three of them are born in Thiruvarur, and have lived in and around Thanjavur at the same time,” concludes the director.

Trinity will be staged in Toronto, Houston, Austin, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Jose, Philadelphia, New Jersey and Dallas from March 7 to April 12.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/xa3roh/article30913905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26mptrinityJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/the-madras-players-trinity-is-set-to-tour-the-us-and-canada/article30913906.ece

According to an assessment by the State Project Director on inclusive education intervention, of the ₹36.61 crore allotted to all districts, only ₹11.40 crore had been spent till January.

“The physical and financial progress made under Samagra Sikshya scheme is not encouraging.

Summons significant

Several key civic bodies in the State, including the Kolkata Muncipal Corporation, are likely to go to the polls in the next few months. The summons to the State Election Commissioner before a formal announcement of the polls is made assumes lot of significance.

The Kozhikode District Committee of the All Kerala Meat Merchants’ Association is planning a series of protests against the Kozhikode Corporation over the delay in implementing the project for a state-of-the-art slaughterhouse at Kothi.

The association alleged lack of interest among the officials of the corporation in executing the project. The ₹9.5-crore slaughterhouse has been included in the Kozhikode Corporation’s project plan for the year 2019-20. The proposal for the project was forwarded to the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), which returned it seeking further clarification in the detailed project report (DPR). It also demanded a soil test report. However, even after the soil testing was carried out, the revised project is yet to be forwarded to KIIFB and the association holds the engineering wing of the corporation responsible for the delay.

“It has been seven to eight months since KIIFB asked for the clarification. If it is not speeded up, the corporation may not be able to implement it in this financial year”, said K.P.M. Saleem, district president of the association.

The association has been demanding the slaughterhouse for over a decade. Even though the corporation councillors were supportive, the project hit a road block when the people at Kothi started a protest the take-over the their football ground for the slaughterhouse project. However, the corporation offered to provide another play ground and settled the protests.

Mr. Saleem said that the setting up of the slaughterhouse was very important for the meat merchants, as they were unable to get the trade licence in the absence of a proper slaughterhouse. “The project will benefit over 1,000 people”, he said.

340,2020/02/25,MVD to check GPS trackers in school vehicles,"27 vehicles found carrying students beyond permitted number

The enforcement wing of the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) has decided to go ahead with stringent legal action against schools which are yet to have functional Global Position System (GPS) trackers in their educational institution vehicles for ensuring students’ safety.

In one of the recent surprise inspections, the MVD squad had found that the trackers fixed in some of the educational institution vehicles in the city were not working properly and, therefore, failed to serve the purpose.

An officer attached to the MVD enforcement wing said the control room set up at Chevayur had all facilities to monitor the speed of educational institution vehicles fitted with GPS trackers. He said the monitoring process would be very effective with the flawless operation of the trackers in vehicles.

He said that the practice of operating school buses violating the permitted capacity would be viewed seriously. “In the last week’s inspection, we could trace such 27 vehicles. There were even school buses operated without fitting speed governors. Henceforth, weekly inspection of school buses will be conducted by the road safety squads,” he said.

As of now, there are about 1,000 educational institution vehicles, including light motor vehicles, in Kozhikode district which will have to comply with the directive on fixing GPS trackers. It will also be examined during the annual fitness check-up conducted ahead of the new academic year. It is planned to issue fitness certificates only to such GPS-enabled vehicles from next academic year.

Installation of GPS in school vehicles, which was proposed by the district administration and the Road Safety Authority as a safety initiative in 2011, was introduced in the district after several rounds of discussions with school authorities and other stakeholders in 2019. Later on, it was implemented as a rule across the State on a directive from the Transport Commissioner.

The device, estimated to cost ₹15,000 for a vehicle, was proposed as a practical solution for parents, school authorities and the government departments concerned to keep track of the movement of school vehicles and the speed at which they travel. Issuing of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) cards too was part of the project, which was implemented by some aided and private schools in the district.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/mvd-to-check-gps-trackers-in-school-vehicles/article30907564.ece

342,2020/02/25,Faculty recruitment: more petitions against Calicut varsity,"Authorities accused of flouting reservation norms

More complaints are reaching the Office of the Governor over the recruitment of faculty members at Calicut University as the authorities are being accused of flouting reservation norms.

Last week, a group of Indian Union Muslim League MLAs and functionaries of the Confederation of Kerala College Teachers had submitted a memorandum to the Governor, who is also the Chancellor of the university, urging him to seek a report from the authorities. They had pointed out that the notification for recruitment for 116 teaching posts was issued without clarifying community-wise reservation norms.

Following this, the Save Education Campaign Committee, an organisation of educational activists, too approached the Governor, claiming that different universities were adopting different procedures for faculty recruitment. The organisation also alleged that reservation norms were given the go-by and sought the Governor’s intervention to set things right.

The university authorities did not specify the reservation category while issuing notifications to fill teachers’ posts in various departments, pointing out that they were complying with an order of the Kerala High Court. While cancelling an earlier notification for appointment of Assistant Professors, the court had in 2016 pointed out that publishing reservation details at the time of notification was illegal. The authorities claimed that the details would be published at the time of appointment. Candidates shall be recruited as per the roster following the Kerala State and Subordinate Services Rules (KSSSR), 1958, they said.

However, the committee functionaries noted in the memorandum that Kerala University and the Cochin University of Science and Technology had issued notification specifying community-wise reservation categories. Various universities approaching contradictory procedures is in violation of KSSSR, they pointed out.

Sources in the Governor’s Office, meanwhile, said the petitions against the recruitment procedures were in the process of being examined.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/faculty-recruitment-more-petitions-against-calicut-varsity/article30907199.ece

344,2020/02/25,Drumstick farmers happy,"It is in great demand and fetches good price

With high demand for drumsticks in the north, “karumbu murungai” and “naatu murungai” farmers are happy as they have been reaping good returns.

Drumsticks are grown in vast areas in this district and in nearby Theni district. Athur Union, Oddanchatram, Reddiarchatram, Puduchatram, Chinnalapatti and some of the hamlets where drumsticks are raised.

Even as majority of growers were awaiting harvest, there has been inquiries and orders from West Bengal and Odisha merchants, said A Alagarsami at Chinnalapatti wholesale market here.

“We are selling drumstick at ₹ 55 per kg. Our farmers are happy about the price. It is likely to continue as orders are still coming seeking more drumsticks,” he added.

Drumsticks are neatly packed in gunny bags of 50 kg and 100 kg with neem leaves placed on top and loaded on trucks as they had to travel at least four to five nights to reach the destination, a lorry operator in Athur said and added that in the last four days alone, close to 25 trucks had been despatched from this region.

Farmers said that they have procured from drumsticks from Andipatti in Theni district where too the “karumbu murungai” was grown. This is what buyers in West Bengal want as these drumsticks are tasty and have a longer shelf life.

Usually, drumsticks in wholesale market would be sold at ₹ 20 to 25 a kg to local traders. With short supply and high demand, farmers have quoted ₹ 20 to ₹ 30 more per kg, which would prevail for another fortnight.

It is a welcome development that farmers themselves quote the price to buyers instead of merchants.

Horticulture department officials said conventional drumsticks were preferred by consumers in the north while people in cities like Bangaluru preferred hybrid variety. The district had the unique distinction of growing drumsticks in large areas as the soil and weather were favourable for the produce. Next to Dindigul, farmers in Kumbakonam, Jayamkondam, Srimushnam and Andimadam grew drumstick in vast lands, officials said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/drumstick-farmers-happy/article30916614.ece

Padmashri awardee Manohar Devadoss said that he did not even know of his nomination until a group of his friends who were already getting letters of recommendation told him about their operation.

Speaking at a felicitation function organised by Aravind Eye Care System here on Tuesday, Mr. Devadoss said that he had precious friends who took the effort to surprise him and acknowledge his accolades.

Thanking members of the Aravind Hospital family which had written him letters, penned forewards for his books and helped sail through his gradual path to blindness, Mr. Devadoss said that he was thankful.

“Who would consider becoming blind a gift, you might ask. When I lost my left eye to cataract and right to Retinitis pigmentosa, I thought of it as a blessing. It paved way for me to write my books upon [my wife] Mahima’s suggestion,” he said.

He added that before becoming mostly blind, the years between 1976 and 1979 were most productive. He painted a number of paintings and even went on to put up an art show, he said.

Ever since, he has authored and illustrated seven books and made dear friends along the way, he said. He said “I love you all,” as he concluded.

349,2020/02/25,Release pension benefits to centenarian: HC,"Madurai

Bringing relief to a centenarian, who served as a Tamil Pandit from 1944 to 1964, the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court directed the State government to release his pension benefits within two weeks so that he could enjoy the fruits in his lifetime.

Hearing the petition filed by K. Srinivasan of Virudhunagar who served as a Tamil Pandit in various aided schools till the post was abolished in 1964, Justice J. Nisha Banu directed the State to release the pension benefits of the 100-year-old man.

The petitioner moved the court after several of his representations seeking disbursement of pension were rejected by the State. The stumbling block for him was the fact that he was unable to produce relevant records to prove his employment except for Service Certificates provided by schools where he worked.

The court observed that under the Tamil Nadu non-Government Teachers Pension Rules, a teacher was eligible for pension if he/she was discharged from service due to abolition of the post.

Taking into account that the petitioner was a centenarian and the documents relating to his service were not traceable, the court directed the authorities concerned to consider the case of the petitioner sympathetically based on the documents produced by him.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/release-pension-benefits-to-centenarian-hc/article30915705.ece
350,2020/02/25,Damaged road being relaid,"Work on re-laying 6 km-long badly damaged road between Manimuthar Dam check-post and Thalaiyanai is about to be completed before this weekend.

As the stretch between the Manimuthar Dam check-post and Thalaiyanai was in the worst shape as the narrow road was unmotorable, work on relaying the road was taken up in mid-2019 following repeated requests from the public. However, the work was not completed immediately that forced the affected public to approach the State Human Rights Commission.

After the SHRC intervened and its member Judge Jayachandran inspected the stretch, the work resumed after the end of north-east monsoon. Now, the final phase of the work, spreading of bitumen – blue metal mix, has commenced. As this work started from the check-post on Tuesday, buses going to Maanjolai and tourist vehicles were not allowed. But vehicles carrying essential commodities for the tea estate workers of Maanjolai and ambulances were allowed.

351,2020/02/25,"Inland letters marked to Collector, a means of empowerment","MADURAI

A total of 10,000 blank inland letters addressed to the Collector have been issued and distributed to students from Classes 9, 10, 11 and 12 in Madurai to provide a safe and anonymous pathway to reporting abuse.

The initiative headed by Collector T.G. Vinay was implemented to give students as many pathways to discussing abuse and violence taking place in their homes or their neighbourhood.

Mr. Vinay said that a number of young students, particularly girls, are hesitant about reaching out to the police in case of child marriage or abuse, because of the stigma attached to complaining.

“In an attempt to alleviate them from the discomfort of not reaching out, we have provided them letters addressed to me,” he said.

The letters will arrive at the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) as the Collector is the Chairman of the wing.

“Members of the DCPU, the Child Welfare Committee and the jurisdictional police officer will deal with the issue based on complaint,” he said.

In Othakadai Government Girls Higher Secondary School alone, the administration handed out 1,700 blank letters.

S. Venkatesan, a faculty member, said that problems both at home and at school can be written and sent to the Collector, providing students with a sense of power.

DCP Officer A. Ganesan said that students in all four educational districts — Madurai, Usilampatti, Melur and Tirumangalam — have received the cards and only one reply has been received. “Based on the response, we have suspended the employee,” he said.

“There are a high number of teenage pregnancies in rural areas in Madurai. Although this has not been documented, most young women, who begin menstruating, either drop out of school or get married the day they turn 18 years. Sometimes, the nuptials are completed even before they reach the legal marriageable age. We hope to popularise reaching out to Child Line or use such anonymous methods to speak about the issues,” said Dr. Vinay.

The Collector added that friends of vulnerable students must actively use their voice to complain against wrongdoings to help another in trouble. “We are also trying to popularise the use of 1098 as the Child Line number in cases of emergencies,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/x9v36c/article30915613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26MASchoold-Letter,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/inland-letters-marked-to-collector-a-means-of-empowerment/article30915614.ece
352,2020/02/25,"HC: Set up homes for destitute women, victims of heinous crimes","Court directs official to formulate policies within eight weeks

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the State government to look into the issue of establishing homes for destitute women and victims of heinous crimes, particularly for those above 18 years of age.

Taking into account that there were no such rehabilitation homes in the State, Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana directed the Secretary, Social Welfare Department to formulate, in consultation with the other Secretaries, policies to address the issue within eight weeks.

The court reiterated that there should be a permanent committee constituted for laying down a protocol procedure or permanent mechanism for expediting termination of pregnancy involving rape victims and abnormal foetal cases.

The Health Secretary should look into the issue and take steps in this regard, the court said, while hearing the petition filed by the mother of a child with special needs, who sought termination of her daughter’s pregnancy.

The girl from Thoothukudi district was sexually assaulted by their neighbour, a 55-year-old man. Following a complaint, a first information report was registered and the accused arrested. Later, he was remanded in judicial custody under the different sections of the POCSO Act.

The court, which had allowed the termination of pregnancy of the 17-year-old girl based on reports filed by medical experts, in its detailed order, directed the Principal District Judge, Thoothukudi, to monitor the status of the girl, following the termination of pregnancy, till she recovered completely.

The PDJ was directed to file a report to the court once in two weeks in this regard. The minor has been admitted to a home and as the family is suffering in penury, medical care has been extended to the girl. The case was adjourned till the first week of March.

The court also directed preservation of the DNA of the foetus for the purpose of criminal trial and speeding up of the trial.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-set-up-homes-for-destitute-women-victims-of-heinous-crimes-madurai-thoothukudi/article30915339.ece
353,2020/02/25,Chithirai festival to bring some relief from pothole-filled first reach of New Natham Road,"Fifteen months have gone since the stretch between Indian Oil Corporation junction and Bharathi Ula Road was closed for traffic for building an elevated corridor

Madurai

Fifteen months have passed since the stretch of New Natham Road between Indian Oil Corporation junction and Bharathi Ula Road was closed for traffic to take up construction of an elevated corridor.

The project is all about providing a four-way elevated corridor for 7.3 km between IOC junction and Chettikulam on New Natham Road. Beyond that the four-way road would run on the ground up to Thuvarankurichi via Natham, providing a shorter four-way highway to Tiruchi.

The work that started in November 2018 has been scheduled to be completed in 24 months.

“It has been a tough ordeal to ride or drive on New Natham Road ever since the work started,” complains A. Ramalinga Siva, a resident of Kalai Nagar. A regular user of this road, Mr. Siva says the potholes have been testing his patience. “While nothing could be done to prevent the dust while riding a motorbike, what is more dangerous is vehicles not following lane discipline,” he says.

Especially school and college bus drivers give the go-by to lane discipline and take wrong lanes to bypass slow-moving vehicles.

“This is a nightmarish experience as all of a sudden you would be confronted by speeding buses during the morning hours and they do not have any concern for the safety of other road users,” he complains.

Two-wheeler riders are worst affected due to lack of signboards on dug-up portion of roads. “This makes night ride more dangerous,” laments one of them.

However, there seems to be some relief from potholes for road users coming in the near future. “We plan to open the road for vehicular traffic for some 1.2 km to enable smooth conduct of Lord Kallazhagar procession,” said V. Saravanan, Project Director, National Highways Authority of India.

The work has been progressing well and out of the total 189 piers, 174 piers have been erected. The caps have been provided to 148 piers. The launchers are working in three different stretches – near Bharati Ula Road, Naganakulam and Oomachikulam.

Work of launching girders (using pre-stressed concrete segments) on 32 spans out of 188 spans has been completed.

“A major portion of the work of girder launching on the 1.2-km-long stretch between IOC junction and Mariamman Temple in Armed Reserve Ground (up to the theatre complex) has been completed. With two full months left for the Chitirai festival, we plan to complete the remaining work and make the road usable for Lord Kallazhagar’s procession,” he added.

The procession that starts at Kallazhagar Temple in Alagarkoil winds through Alagarkoil Road up to Pudur. Then it reaches Mariamman Temple on New Natham Road and then turns towards IOC junction. Thousands of devotees wait and follow Lord Kallazhagar all the way, for which a smooth road is inevitable for their safety.

NHAI officials say that they had taken up similar works of making the road safe for devotees during the festival last year. “We had removed all the barricades put around each pillar and filled up the dug-up portions of the road,” an official added.

The road was cleared of all debris and protruding iron rods of the piers were covered. Warning boards were kept to caution the devotees to keep away from the piers. “We are going to do the same with better facilities this year,” he added.

With the construction of drainage and duct on both sides of the road already completed, the officials are expediting the girder launching so that the first layer of the bitumen road could be laid to make it motorable.

An NHAI official said that with the existing road having been dug up very deep to erect the piers, the ground would not get settled easily. “We have been doing this job of filling up the dug-up portion layer by layer so that it is tightly packed and when the road is laid, it does not sink in,” the official added.

While last year, the stretch between IOC junction and Bharathi Ula Road remained closed even during Chithirai festival, this time it would be opened for the procession to pass through.

“Though the road would be opened for the festival, it would be closed intermittently for taking up further works, like putting up the slab over the girder, construction of crash barriers and median and painting work,” he added. And finally, one more layer of bitumen top would be laid.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/xx8m3v/article30914876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA26CITY-BRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/chithirai-festival-to-bring-some-relief-from-pothole-filled-first-reach-of-new-natham-road/article30914878.ece
354,2020/02/25,Chanakya Sabadham brings back memories of R.S. Manohar,"Madurai

The second day of the 45th Tamil Isai Vizha at Raja Muthiah Mandram featured Veena Venu Mrudangam.

Veena, along with venu (flute) and mrudangam, came together and explored the rhythms of Carnatic music. This programme provided a platform for the artistes A. K. Droupathi and S. Lalitha Devi on veena, C. Agathya Ilavarasan on the violin and D. Bharathwaj on the flute.

They started off with ""Karunai seivai gaja rajamuka"" in Hamsadwani from Papanasam Sivan’s Ganesa Kritits. In quick succession, they rendered “Devi neeye thunai” on the presiding deity of Madurai in Keeravani, again by the same composer.

The artistes also rendered “Mathar madapidiyum” by Sambandar from the Pann Yazhmuri. Other pieces included “Ananda natam aaduvaar” (Neelakaanta Shivan) in Poorvi Kalyani, “Aru marundoru tani (Muttu Thandavar) in Kambhoji and concluded the concert with ‘Janani Janani Janani’ in Revathi, composed by Cuddalore Subramaniam.

Prime time programme was Chanakya Sabadham, a drama popularised by late R.S. Manohar, written by veteran writer late Madurai Thirumaran and directed by S. Sivaprasad. The play aims to unveil the goodness of misunderstood Chanakya and attempts to portray his faultlessness. It revolves around the humiliation of Chanakya and how he was insulted by the emperor of the Nanda dynasty, who ruled the Magadha kingdom.

The play also shows how Chanakya defends himself against allegations made by the apparitions of the people, who died due to his scheming. It concludes with Chanakya winning his vow by crowning Chandragupta Maurya as King of Mahadhanaad.

The play enabled the audience, who were spellbound till the end, to know about the legendary guru Chanakya, who dedicated his life to forming the Maurya Empire and guiding its pioneer, Chandragupta Maurya and his son Bindusara.

A steady pace of the story, apt and quick screen changes, and twists and turns in the drama, which had a lot of punch lines made the audience feel how Chanakya meticulously acted in a difficult situation.

Shivaprasad (nephew of R.S. Manohar) as Chanakya, Nadana Sabhapathy as Rakshasan, Kannan as Chandragupta and Rajamansingh as Seleucus portrayed their characters well. The coordinated effort of all the actors made the audience feel the real 'Manohar Drama' effect.

355,2020/02/25,Students complain about old bicycles to Collector,"MADURAI

A set of students from Class 11 of the American College Higher Secondary School arrived at the Collectorate here, complaining about being given broken and old bicycles on Tuesday.

In the academic year 2001-2002, former Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa launched the free bicycle scheme for girl students and those from Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) communities to augment education. The scheme was subsequently extended to all categories in government and government-aided schools.

One of the students pointed to the slashed tires and the broken basket on his bicycle. A resident of Therkku Street in Melur, the student said that he had to cycle nearly 10 km to get to school. While in some cycles the chain was broken, others did not seem to have any seats. One cycle’s mudguard was bent.

Another schoolmate asked how the students were expected to ride on these broken cycles to class. “We are not from affluent families. We want a solution from the school and the government which has given us these bicycles,” he said.

He added that around 250 bicycles were distributed of which 1/5th was broken. The students submitted a petition to the Collector.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/students-complain-about-old-bicycles-to-collector/article30914612.ece
356,2020/02/25,"Ward delimitation irks public, parties","Expressing dissatisfaction over the manner in which delimitation of wards in local bodies was done, representatives of political parties and the public, who participated in the public hearing on delimitation of wards, said wards of local bodies should be demarcated considering convenience of local residents.

As the wards of Tirunelveli Corporation, municipalities, town panchayats and village panchayats have been delimited and notification in this connection had been made in the civic bodies concerned, a public hearing on this delimitation was held on Tuesday with Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish in chair.

Former chairman of Maanur union and AIADMK functionary ‘Kallur’ Velayutham said the Vannikonenthal area, which was earlier with Melaneelithanallur union due to its proximity, had been annexed with the far off Maanur union, which would cause extreme difficulty to residents of Vannikonenthal firka.

Similarly, the delimitation of Kuruvikulam, Melaneelithanallur, Maanur and Paapaakudi, which had been done without considering the convenience of local residents, would bother the public whenever they had to visit the local body office for any purpose. Without keeping in mind the convenience of the local people, demarcation of wards had been done, Mr. Velayutham said.

Indian Union Muslim League’s L.K.S. Meeran said the number of wards in Melapalayam zone of Tirunelveli Corporation had been drastically reduced from 14 to 10 by increasing the number of voters in each ward.

“While the number of voters in a ward in Melapalayam Zone after the delimitation stands around 9,000, it is only 4,500 in a few wards in other zones, which is quite unjustifiable. The number of voters in all wards should be more or less equal so that the number of wards in a particular zone will not get reduced drastically. In other words, the increased number of voters in a few wards will seriously affect implementation of work in those wards, especially sanitary operations everyday,” he said.

The MDMK’s political advisory committee member Kallaththiyan said Thimmarajapuram near Shanthi Nagar, which was with Palayamkottai zone prior to the delimitation, had been annexed with Thatchanallur zone. “If a resident of Thimmarajapuram has to visit the Thatchanallur zonal office, he or she will have to go all the way to the zonal office in Tirunelveli Junction instead of travelling just 3 km to reach the Palayamkottai zone office. So, Thimmarajapuram should be allowed to be with Palayamkottai Zone,” he said.

District secretary of BJP Suresh said Kulavanigarpuram of Melapalayam Zone, which was in ward 28, had been sliced into three wards – 31, 43 and 52. It was in the worst shape as ward 31 had been annexed with Thatchanallur zone while the Melapalayam Zone office was just 2 km away from Kulavanigarpuram.

Public too opined that demarcation of wards should be done without hurting residents’ convenience.

Ms. Shilpa, after the public hearing, assured that a final decision on delimitation would be taken after carefully considering the views of the public.

District Revenue Officer B. Muthuramalingam, Project Director, District Rural Development Agency, Manthrachalam, Corporation Commissioner G. Kannan, and Assistant Director of Panchayats Arunachalam participated in the public hearing.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ward-delimitation-irks-public-parties/article30914345.ece

358,2020/02/25,"Transman, wife seek legal protection","A 22 year-old transman, Siva* and his 21 year-old wife Priya* who got married on Sunday morning in Erode, fled to Madurai, seeking legal protection from their relatives, on Monday.

Siva and Priya who studied together in Namakkal for three years fell in love while completing their B.Com course. They claimed that they got married, following Hindu customs at Masani Amman Temple in Erode. Soon after the nuptials, they took a bus to Madurai, as Priya’s parents had threatened to complain to the police and torture her.

The couple arrived in Madurai at 12.30 p.m. to a transgender activist’s house who gave them shelter and helped them draft a petition to the Collector, Commissioner, Social Welfare Officer and the Legal Services Authority, seeking protection from their respective families. At 1 p.m., the couple arrived at Madurai District Court and exchanged garlands in front of V. Deepa, Sub Judge and District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) secretary, who said that she would forward the petition to the respective authorities.

Advocate S. Mohandoss, who promised to help the couple, said that they arrived in Madurai for moral support from the transgender community here. He said he would file a petition before the High Court seeking a direction to register their marriage.

The story

Siva and Priya’s love story goes back four years.

“I dropped out in my final year and tried to escape my parents who were trying to emotionally blackmail me into not transforming. This phase lasted for exactly one-and-a-half years. During this time, Priya and I only kept in touch via phone,” he says.

Priya says that until her escape yesterday to get married, no one in her family or her circle of friends knew that she was in love with Siva.

“It was our first year when he approached me. I thought he was crazy. ‘How can a woman and another woman love each other, I wondered,” she said. It took two months for Siva to explain that he was a transman to Priya. Ever since, they have continued to be in love, they say.

Siva who has been taking hormone treatments, eventually wishes to undergo a surgery for complete physical transformation. He is saving up money by working as a cashier at a petrol pump in Erode, earning ₹13,000 a month.

He says Priya will not work because he does not want to burden her. Priya says that she is fine with any decisions he wishes to make.

Siva says that any revelation of their identity would mean that he would lose his house and his job. “We are trying hard to be secretive but I wonder how much of all this can be contained. I also do not know for sure about our future. I only want to save us from any trouble,” he says.

359,2020/02/25,"Now, Thathaneri presents a picture of contrast","Alongside the gloom of cremation ground, Corporation workers have raised lively maize and saplings

For most people, the very thought of Thathaneri will evoke a picture of smoke, dirt and cremation grounds. But in stark contrast, just 100 metres away from the cremation grounds, rows of maize crop and patches of green saplings have been raised near the micro composting centre (MCC) run by Madurai Corporation.

In a novel initiative, the Corporation workers are nurturing these saplings using the manure processed from the MCC unit. The workers are growing a range of vegetables, including tomato, lady’s finger, pumpkin, banana, drumstick, and green leafy vegetables. Currently, maize crops, which were sown in the beginning of the year, stand three-foot tall.

They have also raised saplings of tree species such as vaagai, pungai and badam on a patch of land using Miyawaki method, a technique of raising dense forest, named after Japanese botanist and plant ecologist Akira Miyawaki. These plants are watered through drip irrigation method.

Sanitary Inspector P. Nagaraj says that initially a tomato plant grew out of waste water which was poured into the soil. “It created a spark and then we started raising other crops. Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan also encouraged us to grow trees using the Miyawaki method. Recently, we have planted around 400 agathi keerai saplings,” he says.

No easy task

Growing these saplings amid construction debris is not an easy task, says G. Senthil Kumar, the supervisor of the MCC unit. “For many years, the debris of the wall that was razed by the Corporation, was scattered on the premises. This also affected the quality of the soil. Hence, we are slowly clearing the debris and expanding our farming area,” he says.

The organic waste collected from residences in Thathaneri and Aruldosspuram are shredded, decomposed and sieved to produce manure at the unit. Mr. Kumar says that since the commissioning of the centre last November, around 66 tonnes of manure had been processed at the unit. “We are using this manure to raise crops to instil confidence among the residents about the quality of our manure,” he says.

Mr. Nagaraj says that they are planning to feed hens present at the centre with maize, after their harvest. “After the agathi keerai trees grow, we are planning to give the greens to the nearby residences for free. This will also help in improving nutritious intake of the residents,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/czrtwx/article30909723.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25MACITY-MAIZE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/now-thathaneri-presents-a-picture-of-contrast/article30909725.ece

Students of Tamil Isai Sangam performed “Thevara Innisai” by reciting popular hymns. The prime time programme was “Irai Isai” by Veeramani Raju with percussionist Ramu on the keyboard, Prakash on tabla, Babu on ghanjira and drums and Ramkumar on moharsing.

It was a retro experience for the audience as they heard songs popularised by great artistes of yesteryears - Sirkazhi Govindarajan, Madurai Somu, T. M. Soundararajan and K. Veeramani.

Raju began his concert by invoking the blessings of Ganapathy through Avvaiyar’s “Vakkundam nalla manamundam.”

Then he sang “Orumanikorumani” from Sirkazhi’s Ganapathy Gaanangal. Mahasivratri was the focal point and Veeramani sang many songs in praise of Lord Siva.

“Va nee va deva Sambhava” on various Siva shrines was the pick of the lot. He also sang his favourite “ Irrumudi thangi “ on Lord Ayyappa composed by Veeramani and K Somu.

The vocalist's next selection was “Yennudaiya aattam yellaam,” a song popularised by Sirkazhi Govindarajan, which was penned by Ulundurpet Shanmugam.

“Kothain thiruppavai,” a song popularised by his father, was well sung and appreciated by the audience. This was followed by “Chinnanchiru penn pole,” the song written by Ulundurpet Shanmugam and sung by Sirkazhi on site during a visit to the Chidambaram temple.

“Kurai ondrum illai” by Rajaji, “Kondai mudi alangarithu” on Meenakshi by Somu, Kannadasan’s “Sithamellam enakku Sivamayame” and “Ullathil nalla ullam,” Madurai Somu’s “Marudamalai mamaniye” and Thirupugazh, “Muththaiththaru paththith thirunakai"" were the other songs.

Speaking at the annual day programme later, Mr. Bhat said students have to consciously get involved in the development of their overall personality. If they develop their personality on the foundation of dedication, truth and resolve, society would witness positive growth, he said. He urged students, who are completing their pre-university course, to choose the right path.

366,2020/02/25,Dalit leaders seek opening of Ambedkar Bhavan,"Demanding inauguration of Ambedkar Bhavan in Urwa Store before Ambedkar Jayanti in April, Dalit leaders on Monday said the premises of the Bhavan should not be opened for conducting ‘Nemotsava’ and other rituals.

At the district-level Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe grievance redressal meet chaired by Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh, senior Dalit leader Devadas said a promise was made by a then Minister, while laying the foundation stone for the Bhavan in 2017, that the structure would be in operation in a year. Though the Bhavan is ready, it is yet to be inaugurated, he said.

District Social Welfare Officer Yogish said the delay was because the Karnataka Housing Board, which has constructed the Bhavan, has to receive payment of ₹3 crore. A Dalit activist said the district administration should resolve the issue and inaugurate the building before Ambedkar Jayanti.

Dalit activist Ramesh Kotian said there was pressure on Mangaluru City Corporation to permit ‘Nemotsava’ in the parking area of the Bhavan. “The district administration should not allow this. Legal action should be taken against those who are try to misuse the Bhavan’s premises,” he said.

367,2020/02/25,‘Cong. will bite the dust as AICC has failed to appoint KPCC chief’,"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State unit president and MP Nalin Kumar Kateel on Monday said that the Congress would bite the dust in the State as that party high command was unable to appoint a Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president despite their resignations months ago.

He was speaking at a function held to install the president and other office-bearers of the district unit of the BJP here. He handed over the party flag to the new district unit president Kuilady Suresh Nayak on the occasion.

Mr. Kateel said that if the Congress high command appointed D.K. Shivakumar as KPCC president, the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah would leave the party and vice-versa. If the party high command managed to accommodate both Mr. Shivakumar and Mr. Siddaramaiah, then the former Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwara would leave the party.

The Congress was in a poor shape because of corruption, dynastic politics, hunger for power and a weak organisation, he said.

The people in the State had appreciated the good work carried out by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in reaching out to the people of the districts of North Karnataka when there were floods there.

People had also liked the good work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in abrogating Article 370 giving special status for Jammu and Kashmir. A Ram Temple would be built in Ayodhya within three years. Udupi should be made a “Congress Mukt” district, Mr. Kateel said.

Shobha Karandlaje, MP, said that since 1980, the Congress had only two All India Congress Committee (AICC) presidents, who were not from the Nehru-Gandhi family, they were P.V. Narasimha Rao and Sitaram Kesri. But in the BJP, the party presidents got changed every three years. It was not under the clutches of a dynasty as the Congress was, she said.

368,2020/02/25,Discussion on sustainable development of Mattu Gulla,"Seminar on Udupi Mallige at Bantakal on Friday

The Manipal Institute of Management (MIM) will, in association with Visvesvaraya Trade Promotion Centre (VTPC), organise a seminar on “Sustainable development and roadmap for the future of Mattu Gulla” on MIM campus in Manipal on February 27.

It would also organise a seminar on “Sustainable development and roadmap for the future of Udupi Jasmine” in association with the Sri Madhwa Vadiraja Institute of Technology and Management (SMVITM) at Bantakal on February 28.

Addressing presspersons here on Monday, Harish G. Joshi, coordinator, Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, MIM, said that both the Mattu Gulla (brinjal) and Udupi Mallige (jasmine) enjoyed Geographical Indication (GI) certification.

Even after getting GI tag for their produce, farmers were unable to reap the benefits of the recognition due to several factors, including poor marketing.

Hence, it was necessary to popularise these produces with GI tag so as to create a wide market and double the income of farmers. It was necessary to document the current practices of farming of Mattu Gulla and Udupi Mallige, create awareness about GI and its impact among farmers.

It was necessary to explore market potential and expansion possibilities for these produces and develop strategic plans for their sustainable growth.

Both seminars would discuss various issues related to Mattu Gulla and Udupi Mallige and involve all stakeholders. Mattu Gulla was being grown in about 210 acres of land in Mattu and its surrounding villages and there were 210 growers involved.

There was potential to grow Mattu Gulla in another 140 acres of land which was mostly lying fallow.

The average age of farmers growing Mattu Gulla was 45 to 50. Hence, it was necessary to attract the youth to Mattu Gulla cultivation, which was quiet profitable.

Plans are also being drawn up to check salt water intrusion in land where Mattu Gulla was being grown and discussions would be held with the Minor Irrigation Department in this matter, he said.

“We are also thinking of developing a model farm on Mattu Gulla cultivation on one or 1.5 acres of land where demonstration on its cultivation can be given,” he said. The government was planning to bring Udupi Jasmine cultivators under a Farmer Producers Organisation, Mr. Joshi said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/9yu7i/article30907840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25MNMATTUGULLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/discussion-on-sustainable-development-of-mattu-gulla/article30907841.ece
369,2020/02/25,"Congress is facing intellectual bankruptcy, says Kateel","It has become irrelevant as it has lost the confidence of the people in the country: State BJP president and MP

Launching a scathing attack on the Congress ahead of the coming gram panchayat elections, State BJP president and MP Nalin Kumar Kateel said here on Monday that the grand old party was facing intellectual bankruptcy and it was fomenting violence over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the country.

Addressing party workers at a function organised to install the new office-bearers of Dakshina Kannada unit of the party, Mr. Kateel said that the Congress had become irrelevant as it had lost the confidence of people in the country.

He said that dynasty politics, craving for power, corruption and compromising with its grand old principles proved too costly for the party that it could not win enough seats to get recognised as an Opposition party during the last year’s Lok Sabha election.

Mr. Kateel said that the 135-year-old Congress was being headed by an interim president, Sonia Gandhi, now. The Congress could not get a president appointed to its Karnataka unit. Ever since the era of Jawaharlal Nehru, the Congress is still following dynasty leadership.

“How can a party (Congress) which is facing a leadership crisis both at the national and State levels can lead the country?” Mr. Kateel asked.

“Political power in the Congress was vested with its Ministers and MLAs. But in the BJP, the power is vested with its party workers,” he said.

Mr. Kateel said that the BJP would and should continue its party worker-centric approach.

Otherwise, it would have to face the same situation like the Congress was facing now, he added.

The BJP State president said that the Congress was indulging in negative campaigning on the CAA in the country by instigating protesters.

He said that Mahatma Gandhi wanted to give Indian citizenship to minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. The Congress leader, late Indira Gandhi, too wanted it. But the Congress of today could not make the aspirations of its own leaders a reality. The slogans of the Congress were for its leaders like Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, late Rajiv Gandhi, Indira Gandhi and not for India.

Mr. Kateel said that the BJP should win 80 % of seats in the coming gram panchayat elections in the State.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/ful59s/article30907825.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25MNNALINKUMARKATIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/congress-is-facing-intellectual-bankruptcy-says-kateel/article30907827.ece
370,2020/02/25,Coast Guard’s hangar facility in the final stages of approval,"It is to station Dornier aircraft

A proposal to set up a hangar facility for stationing four Dornier aircraft of the Indian Coast Guard at Bajpe for coastal surveillance is in the final stages of approval by the Ministry of Defence, according to Deputy Inspector-General S.B. Venkatesh, Commander, Coast Guard, Karnataka.

The Coast Guard has its air enclave in Bajpe. But there is no hangar to park Dornier aircraft permanently and also to have technical maintenance facilities. It required about 4.25 acres.

“The land acquisition proposal for the hangar facility is being closely pursued with the district administration by the Coast Guard,” Mr. Venkatesh said.

“A full-fledged air enclave in Mangaluru would improve Coast Guard’s surveillance and reconnaissance roles off the coastal areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Lakshadweep Islands, including the uninhabited islands,” the Commander said in a release here on Monday.

In the absence of a hangar facility in Mangaluru, aerial surveillance is now being carried out on Karnataka coast on a regular basis by using Dornier aircraft from Kochi and Daman, he said.

Once the Coast Guard got the required land, there would be a unit establishment for four Dornier aircraft of Dornier Squadron 749, he said.

“A dedicated aerial surveillance from the Coast Guard’s air enclave in Mangaluru would enhance and meet the long-felt need for air surveillance of the exclusive economic zone, as well as search and rescue operation and medical evacuation, humanitarian missions in the State and in the waters adjoining the coast of Karnataka. It will also ensure prompt air-sea coordinated patrol,” he said.

372,2020/02/25,"Developers need to be responsible, should focus on trust, inclusivity: Nadella","According to Microsoft, there are about 4.2 million developers in India and the country is poised to become the numero uno destination for such talent in the coming years.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Tuesday said developers should focus on ethics and building trust when developing solutions to ensure that the benefits of technology are available for everyone.

The India-born top executive also highlighted that developers should work with diverse teams, so that “unconscious biases” do not creep into the models used for developing artificial intelligence (AI).

“Technology is becoming so ubiquitous and pervasive in society in our lives. (It) also comes with responsibility. Every single choice of developer around design ethos, the ethics of the diverse team are going to matter in terms of are we going to create a more inclusive world?” Mr. Nadella said at the ‘Future Decoded’ event here.

He further said the question that needs to be kept in mind is that would these solutions be used for prosperity across industries like retail, healthcare and agriculture or “is it just going to be a narrow sliver of society?”

“I think inclusivity around the surplus that gets created by digital technology, is going to be important,” he told an audience comprising developers, partners and customers.

According to Microsoft, there are about 4.2 million developers in India and the country is poised to become the numero uno destination for such talent in the coming years.

Mr. Nadella, who is on a three-day trip to India, pointed out that platform developers are “first responders” and have to develop trust into technology.

“Every bank that builds an app will have to deal with trust, and trust around AI and the AI models they deploy. The core cybersecurity of their asset, their customers’ data...if there is a real currency of the next 10 years, (it) is how diverse and inclusive your teams are that are building all these technologies - gender diversity, ethnic diversity – because there is no protection against unconscious bias other than diversity,” he said.

With AI being used to generate almost human-like responses, ethics is beginning to be a core part of discussions around training of models for AI. For example, if a developer has a negative bias towards a certain thing, this bias can creep into the solution and impact the output of the solution.

Talking about trust, Mr. Nadella pointed out that the company is meeting all the data residency laws in different countries.

“We have 57 data centre regions. We have three regions in India (Pune, Chennai and Mumbai)...as we are expanding around the world in all of these regions, that means we are also meeting all the data residency and data sovereignty laws,” he added.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 1,000 points on February 24 in the worst day for the stock market in two years as investors worry that the spread of the viral outbreak that began in China will weaken global economic growth.

Traders sought safety in U.S. government bonds, gold and high-dividend stocks like utilities and real estate. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to the lowest level in more than three years.

Technology stocks accounted for much of the broad market slide, which wiped out all of the Dow’s and S&P 500 gains for the year.

""Stock markets around the world are beginning to price in what bond markets have been telling us for weeks that global growth is likely to be impacted in a meaningful way due to fears of the coronavirus,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.

The Dow lost 1,031.61 points, or 3.6%, to 27,960.80. At its low point, it was down 1,079 points

The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks gave up 50.50 points, or 3%, to 1,628.10

Investors looking for safe harbors bid up prices for U.S. government bonds and gold. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell sharply, to 1.37% from 1.47% late Friday. It was at 1.90% at the start of the year.

Germany’s DAX slid 4%

Italy’s benchmark index dropped 5.4%

South Korea’s Kospi shed 3.9%

The viral outbreak threatens to crimp global economic growth and hurt profits and revenue for a wide range of businesses. Companies from technology giant Apple to athletic gear maker Nike have already warned about a hit to their bottom lines. Airlines and other companies that depend on travelers are facing pain from cancelled plans and shuttered locations.

Technology companies were among the worst hit by the sell-off

Apple, which depends on China for a lot of business, slid 4.8%

Microsoft dropped 4.3%

Banks were also big losers

JPMorgan Chase fell 2.7%

Bank of America slid 4.7%

Airlines and cruise ship operators also slumped

American Airlines lost 8.5%

Delta Air Lines dropped 6.3%

Carnival skidded 9.4%

Royal Caribbean Cruises tumbled 9%

Gilead Sciences climbed 4.6% and was among the few bright spots. The biotechnology company is testing a potential drug to treat the new coronavirus. Bleach-maker Clorox was also a standout, rising 1.5%.

Utilities and real estate companies held up better than most sectors. Investors tend to favor those industries, which carry high dividends and hold up relatively well during periods of turmoil, when they’re feeling fearful.

The rotation into defensive sectors has made utilities and real estate the biggest gainers this year, while technology stocks have lost ground.

""The yields have been moving lower all year, so that’s providing a tail wind for utilities, for real estate,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. “In the face of this heightened uncertainty, especially if it’s centered overseas, tech is going to bear some of the brunt of that because it’s been so popular, because it’s done so well, and because it has so much exposure to Asia.”

In the eyes of some analysts, Monday’s tank job for stocks means they’re just catching up to the bond market, where fear has been dominant for months.

U.S. government bonds are seen as some of the safest possible investments, and investors have been piling into them throughout 2020, even as stocks overcame stumbles to set more record highs.

The 10-year yield on Monday was near its intraday record low of 1.325% set in July 2016, according to Tradeweb. The 30-year Treasury yield fell further after setting its own record low, down to 1.83% from 1.92% late Friday.

Traders are increasingly certain that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least once in 2020 to help prop up the economy. They’re pricing in a nearly 95% probability of a cut this year, according to CME Group. A month ago, they saw only a 68% probability.

375,2020/02/25,"Not fair, just or reasonable","Preventive detention laws practically sacrifice due process interests at the altar of crime control

The revocation of statehood for Jammu and Kashmir was accompanied by widespread arrests and detentions under the erstwhile State’s Public Safety Act of 1978, which allows for detention without trial for up to two years. The arrest and detention of persons without requiring them to face a public trial, which is driven towards proving innocence or guilt of an accused person alleged to have committed an offence, is referred to as ‘preventive detention’ in Indian law. Preventive detention statutes exist at both the national and State levels and are intended to serve as effective measures to prevent the occurrence of crime. These different statutes adopt a similar logic. Under these laws, executive officers such as District Magistrates and Commissioners of Police are empowered to pass orders for arrest and to take persons into custody. These powers can be exercised if the officers are “satisfied” that the person’s conduct is posing a risk to certain kinds of interests that the law deems important. For instance, the National Security Act of 1980 permits arrest and detention of persons when it is in the interest of maintaining “public order”, which can occur even without any allegations of the person breaking any existing laws.

No procedural fairness

Since the purpose of preventive detention is to prevent crime, it is argued that compliance with painstaking procedures such as those of a criminal trial would defeat the law’s purpose. Therefore, we find that preventive detention processes come without many of the hallmarks of procedural fairness that we take for granted in regular criminal law. Thus, unlike regular law, there is no need for a person arrested under the exceptional preventive detention process to be informed of the grounds immediately. Nor is there a requirement to produce the arrested person before a court. While all arrests and detentions under preventive detention laws do undergo some subsequent checks, this scrutiny remains almost exclusively executive-based. There is no judicial oversight where detention beyond three months is not sought. And even in those cases which go to a Tribunal comprising judges, there is no public hearing involved and no guaranteed oral hearing for the detenu. No publicly available orders or judgments are published about the ultimate decision. Finally, throughout this process, there is no right to legal assistance for detenues. The only opportunity for many lies in pursuing a writ of habeas corpus before the High Court, which again can only test preventive detention orders on limited grounds. It is barred from undertaking a full-scale review of this executive process.

The idea that laws should permit pre-emptive intervention to prevent the commission of crimes is an appealing one. That the legal framework governing this preventive project comes along with reduced procedural compliances and quick outcomes only makes preventive detention laws more tantalising for security-minded officers, who are thus incentivised to use these exceptional statutes to deal with even ordinary law and order situations, ultimately normalising preventive detention and bringing them down from their exceptional status. This suggestion is supported by the Crime in India Report for 2018 released by the NCRB which disclosed that close to one lakh people were arrested and detained in custody under preventive detention laws, as per government estimates.

Threat to personal liberty

Exceptional situations certainly justify exceptional measures. But there is a fair case to argue that even under this logic, the procedures of preventive detention laws in India practically sacrifice due process interests at the altar of crime control, and this bargain is ill-suited to justice, no matter how grave the risks. In their present form, it is difficult to accept such laws provide us the “fair, just and reasonable” procedure that Article 21 of India’s Constitution demands of any law that takes away personal liberty.

376,2020/02/25,A U.S. strategy only meant to isolate China,"India would be advised to study the Indo-Pacific Strategy instead of jumping into it eagerly

Since 2017, the United States government has released a few reports and fact sheets on its new Indo-Pacific Strategy. It’s impossible to analyse these texts and the speeches by high officials of the U.S. government because they are largely made up of empty phrases. For instance, what does the U.S. mean when it says that the Indo-Pacific Strategy is going to promote “free, fair, and reciprocal trade”? Each of these terms — ‘free’, ‘fair’, and ‘reciprocal’ — need elaboration. But over hundreds of pages there is no explanation of any of these phrases. Buried in these documents is a much deeper agenda of the U.S. government: to use three large Asian states — Australia, India, and Japan — to isolate China. There is nothing else to it.

Scale of Chinese investment

The U.S. government has made it clear that what it finds most objectionable is China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has signed on more than 70 countries in the world. Adopted in 2013, the BRI is intended as a mechanism to end China’s reliance upon the markets of the West and to develop new markets in other continents; it is also intended to use China’s massive surpluses to build infrastructure in key parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. By 2027, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley, China will spend about $1.3 trillion on this ambitious construction project. Even Saudi Arabia, a close ally of the U.S., has made the BRI one of the cornerstones of its Saudi Vision 2030 plan. While China has invested $68 billion to build the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor from Xinjiang to Pakistan’s Gwadar Port, Saudi Arabia has agreed to invest $10 billion in the port itself.

The scale of Chinese investment, and the participation of a range of countries with different political identities in the BRI, is staggering. At the Indo-Pacific Business Forum in July 2018, which was hosted by the U.S. government — tellingly in Washington D.C. — the U.S. bragged that it has spent $2.9 billion through the Department of State and the USAID (United States Agency for International Development). It has lined up hundreds of millions of dollars more through its U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. If you add up all the money that the U.S. intends to spend for economic projects, it is still a fraction of the amount spent by China. There is no appetite in Washington, D.C., with its ‘America First’ attitude, to funnel more money towards investments in the region currently being built by the BRI.

Military claims?

It appears as if U.S. investments will come only with military claims. Nepal is currently debating whether it should accept $500 million from an MCC grant; will this money mean that the Nepali government would have to allow U.S. troops and U.S. bases in the country? This would be objectionable to the Communist government in Kathmandu. A few years ago, Nepal discovered a large amount of uranium in Mustang, near the Nepal-China border; this has certainly motivated U.S. interest in Nepal’s economy. If the U.S. money comes with U.S. military presence, this will create a serious flashpoint in the Himalayas.

Unable to outspend the Chinese, the U.S. government is making a rhetorical argument that it has more respect for “transparency, human rights, and democratic values” than China, which “practices repression at home and abroad” (‘A Free and Open Indo-Pacific’, November 2019). Documents such as these are plainly rhetorical. It is hard to imagine the U.S. being “transparent” with its trade deals. It is equally hard to imagine the U.S. being able to argue that it would not put countries into debt. Libraries are filled with documents that show how the U.S. government enabled a massive Third World debt crisis in the 1980s, which was then used by the U.S.-driven International Monetary Fund’s Structural Adjustment Programs to strangle countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This history is alive, and it makes a mockery of the U.S.’s attempt to say that its own approach is superior to that of China’s.

Apart from that, the U.S. government has already indicated that it is uninterested in multilateral deals — it withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017, for instance. Australia and Japan shrugged, and then put their energy into the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which sidelines the U.S.

In May 2018, the U.S. military’s Pacific Command was renamed the Indo-Pacific Command, a symbolic gesture that provides a military aspect to the Indo-Pacific Strategy. The U.S. government has made it clear that for all its talk of a “free and open Indo-Pacific”, what it actually wants is an Indo-Pacific with fewer Chinese ships and more U.S. warships. Just before this renaming, the U.S. National Security Strategy of 2017 noted that “China seeks to displace the United States in the Indo-Pacific region”, and so the Indo-Pacific Strategy intends for the U.S. to fight for its dominance in the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and in the Asian rim. This is a very dangerous war that the U.S. seeks to impose on Asia.

Inching away

As the military aspect of the Strategy increased, both Australia and Japan edged away from full-scale adoption of the U.S. project. Japan has begun to use the term “Indo-Pacific” without the word “Strategy”, while Australia has signed onto a “comprehensive strategic partnership” with China. Only India remains loyal to the agenda set by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has arrived here with nothing but a bag full of tricks. In all the documents released by the U.S. government and in all the speeches by officials, there is no discussion of the strategy to contain China. There is only rhetoric that skates into belligerent territory.

India would be advised to study the U.S. project rather than jump into it eagerly. Room for an independent foreign policy for India is already narrowed, and room for an independent trade policy is equally suffocated. To remain the subordinate ally of the U.S. suggests that India will miss an opportunity to be part of a reshaped Asia.

377,2020/02/25,"Guns, gas and technology","As President Trump wraps up his two-day trip in India, the goal of $500 billion in two-way trade looks within sight

U.S. President Donald Trump’s first official visit to India could lead to significant outcomes, as there have been regular and sustained engagements between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of forums such as the G7, the G20, and the United Nations General Assembly.

Today, the two countries are collaborating on issues ranging from maritime security to international terrorism, and have recently signed a number of agreements, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) and the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), to push the levels of strategic collaboration to wider fields. In the last few years, the U.S. has categorised India as a ‘Major Defense Partner’ and granted it the ‘Strategic Trade Authorisation-1’ status.

Trade between the two countries has reached a new high. Total two-way trade flows increased to $142.3 billion in 2018, with 2019 figures estimated to be even higher, inclusive of India’s recent liquefied natural gas (LNG) and aircraft purchases. This is expected to go up further with India agreeing to buy naval helicopters from the U.S.

FDI from U.S.

Steady inflows of capital from the U.S. attest to India’s attractiveness as an investment destination for American companies. The U.S. is the fifth-largest source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to India, with a cumulative capital stock of $28 billion. The presence of U.S. companies is found across diverse sectors of the Indian economy including defence and aviation, agriculture, health, education, and insurance. Preliminary findings from a recent CII survey indicate that nearly 86% of U.S. firms are ‘very bullish’ or ‘moderately bullish’ about India’s economic outlook, with approximately 73% of U.S. firms surveyed viewing India as a favourable investment destination and planning to invest more in the next 12 months.

For their part, Indian companies are expanding their investments in the U.S. as well, with the CII’s data reflecting historic rates of investment and job creation, numbering over $18 billion and 1,13,000, respectively. Their investments in research and development as well as Corporate Social Responsibility activities are on the rise, and they are well-integrated with local communities and economies of many U.S. States. The goal of $500 billion in two-way trade is within sight. CII research suggests that in an improved trade scenario, this target could be reached as early as 2030. Businesses from both sides must come together to explore joint strategies and opportunities to resolve issues and facilitate further business. The two most promising sectors for future cooperation are energy and defence. In energy, India would continue to rely on U.S. liquefied natural gas of which it is already the sixth-largest buyer. Indian companies have invested $4 billion in the shale gas sector in the U.S. already. With four working groups set up for oil and gas, energy efficiency, renewable energy and sustainable development, the energy partnership is set to undergo a further jump.

In the defence sector, India has built up its sourcing from the U.S. The recent 2+2 dialogue led to three agreements being inked under the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative to co-develop and co-produce critical technologies. With India’s aspiration to invite FDI in its nascent defence production sector, U.S. companies will have good options for tie-ups with Indian businesses.

Partnerships in technology

While these sectors will continue to dominate the India-U.S. bilateral relationship for the next few years, an aspirational knowledge economy can be envisioned as the way for partnerships ahead. Such an economy would be based on high-technology exports, robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), electric vehicles, and other emerging sectors.

More than 1,200 top global companies, including many from the U.S., have established research and product development centres in India, gaining from the competitive talent available here. As digital transformation becomes the new strategy for enterprises across the globe, Indian and U.S. companies can join hands to shape lives, businesses, and value propositions. Artificial intelligence is likely to dominate the business space in coming years, and India and the U.S. can drive this phenomenon with capacity building of both people and enterprises. Start-up collaborations between two of the most vibrant and dynamic new entrepreneurship hubs can be identified for areas such as agriculture, healthcare and education.

The synergies between the world’s two largest democracies are vast and the visit of Mr. Trump is bound to create new interfaces.

378,2020/02/25,The issues around data localisation,"The contentious clauses on local data storage in the revised Personal Data Protection Bill need re-examination

Among the many important laws that were introduced in the winter session of the Lok Sabha was the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2019. The Bill was referred to a joint parliamentary committee, which is currently engaged in a process of public consultation.

The draft law is a comprehensive piece of legislation that seeks to give individuals greater control over how their personal data is collected, stored and used. Once passed, the law promises a huge improvement on current Indian privacy law, which is both inadequate and improperly enforced.

The PDP Bill, however, is not without its flaws. It has attracted criticism on various grounds such as the exceptions created for the state, the limited checks imposed on state surveillance, and regarding various deficiencies in the structures and processes of the proposed Data Protection Authority.



Watch | All about the Personal Data Protection Bill



Data localisation in draft Bill

One of the more contentious issues in the law Bill are the provisions pertaining to “data localisation”. The phrase, which can refer to any restrictions on cross-border transfer of data (for instance, requirements to seek permission for transfer, the imposition of taxes for foreign transfers of data, etc.), has largely come to refer to the need to physically locate data within the country.

The PDP Bill enables the transfer of personal data outside India, with the sub-category of sensitive personal data having to be mirrored in the country (i.e. a copy will have to be kept in the country). Data processing/collecting entities will however be barred from transferring critical personal data (a category that the government can notify at a subsequent stage) outside the country.

These provisions have been changed from the earlier version of the draft Bill, released by the Justice Srikrishna Committee in 2018. The 2018 draft imposed more stringent measures that required both personal and sensitive personal data to be mirrored in the country (subject to different conditions).

The move to liberalise the provisions in the 2019 version of the Bill is undoubtedly welcome, particularly for businesses and users. Liberalised requirements will limit costs to business and ensure users have greater flexibility in choosing where to store their data. Prima facie, the changes in the 2019 draft reflect a more proportionate approach to the issue as they implement a tiered system for cross-border data transfer, ostensibly based on the sensitivity/vulnerability of the data. This seems in accord with the Supreme Court’s dicta in the 2017 Puttaswamy case, where the Court had made it clear that an interference in the fundamental right to privacy would only be permissible if inter alia deemed necessary and proportionate.

However, on closer examination it appears that even the revised law may not actually stand the test of proportionality.

Purpose of localisation

There are broadly three sets of arguments advanced in favour of imposing stringent data localisation norms: Sovereignty and government functions; referring to the need to recognise Indian data as a resource to be used to further national interest (economically and strategically), and to enable enforcement of Indian law and state functions. The second claim is that economic benefits will accrue to local industry in terms of creating local infrastructure, employment and contributions to the AI ecosystem. Finally, regarding the protection of civil liberties, the argument is that local hosting of data will enhance its privacy and security by ensuring Indian law applies to the data and users can access local remedies.

But if data protection was required for these purposes, it would make sense to ensure that local copies were retained of all the categories of personal data provided for in the Bill (as was the case with the previous draft of the law). In the alternative, sectoral obligations would also suffice (as is currently the case with sectors such as digital payments data, certain types of telecom data, government data, etc.).

Protecting user privacy?

In a 2018 working paper published by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, we pointed at the fallacies in the assumption that data localisation will necessarily lead to better privacy protections. We note that the security of data is determined more by the technical measures, skills, cybersecurity protocols, etc. put in place rather than its mere location. Localisation may make it easier for domestic surveillance over citizens. However, it may also enable the better exercise of privacy rights by Indian citizens against any form of unauthorised access to data, including by foreign intelligence.

Overall, the degree of protection afforded to data will depend on the effectiveness of the applicable data protection regime.

We note that insofar as privacy is concerned, this could be equally protected through less intrusive, suitable and equally effective measures such as requirements for contractual conditions and using adequacy tests for the jurisdiction of transfer. Such conditions are already provided for in the PDP Bill as a set of secondary conditions (the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation too uses a similar framework).

Further, the extra-territorial application of the PDP Bill also ensures that the data protection obligations under the law continue to exist even if the data is transferred outside the country.

If privacy protection is the real consideration, individuals ought to be able to choose to store their data in any location which afford them the strongest privacy protections. Given the previously mentioned infirmities in the PDP Bill, it is arguable that data of Indians will continue to be more secure if stored and processed in the European Union or California (two jurisdictions which have strong data protection laws and advanced technical ecosystems).

In the circumstances, it becomes important for the joint parliamentary committee currently examining the Bill to conduct a more in-depth evaluation of the localisation provisions in the law. The joint parliamentary committee ought to, ideally, identify the need, purpose and practicality of putting in place even the (relatively liberal) measures contained in the PDP Bill. Further, in order for localisation-related norms to bear fruit, either in terms of protecting citizen rights, enabling law enforcement access to data or enabling development of the local economy, there has to be broader thinking at the policy level. This may include for instance, reforming surveillance related laws, entering into more detailed and up-to-date mutual legal assistance treaties, enabling the development of sufficient digital infrastructure, and creating appropriate data-sharing policies that preserve privacy and other third party rights, while enabling data to be used for socially useful purposes.

379,2020/02/25,Challenger’s challenge: On Trump's Democratic rivals,"Bernie Sanders needs to widen his support base without compromising on principles

President Donald Trump may be enjoying the optics and bilateral bonhomie on his maiden official visit to India, but he must be aware that back home, the clock is ticking on his first term in office. Indeed, Mr. Trump’s Democratic rivals have trained their political guns on his record in office for some time now, making it quite likely that the November 2020 presidential poll will be preceded by a blistering campaign. While no single candidate stood out prominently from among the pack through the season of Democratic debates, some, such as Kamala Harris, dropped out and the herd was winnowed. Now, from among the stronger candidates, the primaries and caucuses have handed the edge to one of the President’s most strident critics — Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. The self-professed “Democratic socialist” has pulled away from the rest of the pack — including former Vice-President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar — after his win in the recent Nevada caucuses. Among those fighting for the nomination, Mr. Sanders perhaps stands the best chance of surviving a toe-to-toe battle with Mr. Trump, given that, like his Republican challenger, he stands somewhat askance of his party’s mainstream ethos, for example showing the mettle to take on Wall Street’s excesses rather than lean on them for fund-raising support. This trait goes well with the apparent anti-establishment voter mood; indeed it was this mood that Mr. Trump masterfully tapped into to win the 2016 election.

The challenge for Mr. Sanders, and which he appears to be gradually surmounting, after perhaps learning from his nomination loss to Hillary Clinton in 2016, is to deepen his popularity among minorities: African-Americans, Latinos and other ethnicities. Nevada differs from the two States, Iowa and New Hampshire, that went into caucuses and primaries, respectively, before it, in that it is considerably more racially diverse, with a 35% non-white population. The timing could not have been better for Mr. Sanders too. In less than a week, 15 States and territories will vote for their preferred candidate on a single day, “Super Tuesday”, including large, racially diverse States such as California. If he performs well, cornering a bulk of the 1,357 delegates up for grabs, it may well become impossible for any of the other Democratic hopefuls to even the score later on. The big question is, will he then succeed in carrying independent and undecided voters along with him in the presidential election, and can he move swing States in his favour? If he is to stand a chance of doing that, many think he may need to consider moderating what Mr. Buttigieg described as a dogmatic belief in an “inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans”. To reach out to the wider voter base without losing his core support is the challenge before Mr. Sanders.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/challengers-challenge-on-trumps-democratic-rivals/article30906474.ece
380,2020/02/25,Dual citizenship: on regularising stay of Sri Lankan refugees,"With no legal scope for it, govt. must think of regularising stay of Sri Lankan refugees

The contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, has again triggered an ill-advised demand for dual citizenship to Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka. This refuses to leave public discourse despite the constitutional and legal position being clearly against the grant of dual citizenship per se. As on date, no Indian citizen holds the citizenship of any other country. Even when the Centre amended the Citizenship Act in 2003 to introduce the Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) scheme for sections of the Indian diaspora, all it provided was a limited version of ‘dual citizenship’ which came without political rights and with a bar on purchase of agricultural land. It would defy logic, then, to seek dual citizenship for those who are not Indian nationals. The Centre has consistently favoured voluntary repatriation of refugees to Sri Lanka. Given the possible effect on the demographic mix there, New Delhi, quite rightly, is not in a mood to confer Indian citizenship on them. Although the Central and State governments do a lot to make the refugees’ stay comfortable, most of them are regarded as illegal migrants, as they arrived with no valid travel documents. In the run-up to the 2016 Assembly elections, the then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa, flagged the issue of dual citizenship. Since then, representations have been made regularly to the Centre. Governor Banwarilal Purohit too referred to the demand in his Assembly address last month. Early this month, the government told the Rajya Sabha that neither the Constitution nor the CAA permitted dual citizenship. This ought to put an end to the debate, which will otherwise create false expectations among the refugees.

At the same time, given the need to treat the refugees in a humane manner and in the absence of a law on refugees, the Centre should stop seeing Sri Lankan refugees as “illegal migrants”; they entered India with the knowledge and approval of Indian authorities. As for those who wish to remain in India for studies or to earn a livelihood, the authorities should tweak the OCI Cardholder scheme or offer an exclusive long-term visa. By this, the stay of 95,000-odd refugees in Tamil Nadu will be regularised. As for those keen on returning home but are unable to do so for want of support from Sri Lanka, New Delhi should lean on Colombo to help enable their early return. Besides, the two countries should formulate a scheme of structured assistance to expedite voluntary repatriation, which is moving at a snail’s pace even a decade after the civil war ended. These steps can lead to a lasting resolution of issues concerning those who have been in India for over 30 years.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dual-citizenship-on-regularising-stay-of-sri-lankan-refugees/article30906472.ece
381,2020/02/25,Bus priority lane starts getting physical barriers,"The aim is to prevent two-wheelers and four-wheelers from straying inside

Over three months after the bus priority lane was introduced on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) between Silk Board Junction and Tin Factory, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has finally started installation of plastic bollards and sand-filled crash barriers to tackle the issue of non-compliance of lane discipline. This has been a long-standing demand of citizens.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said that work started on Tuesday and would be completed in a phased manner. “Once the bollards are installed, there will automatically be more compliance, which did not happen so far due to the absence of physical barriers. Once the operations here are stabilised, the bus priority lane will be extended to other corridors,” he said.

Ravikumar Surpur, Special Commissioner, Projects, said that the civic body had got 4G exemption under the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement (KTPP) Act, and the project would be executed through Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Limited (KRIDL).

“Plastic bollards will be placed with a one-metre gap on either side of the bus priority lane. The total length of the lane is 21 km, which means we have to cover 42 km overall,” he said. Sand-filled barriers will be placed at junctions and crucial spots.

C. Shikha, MD, BMTC, said that the design and colour codes were given by the Department of Urban Land Transport (DULT). “We are doing a survey of other stretches where the bus lanes can be extended, including Tin Factory-Hebbal, Goraguntepalya on Tumakuru Road to Nayandahalli junction on Mysuru Road,” she said. She also said that once bollards are installed on ORR, it would be easy for them to extend it to other corridors.

What ails the Bus Priority Lane?

Commuters have reported that the bus priority lane has reduced their commute time by 15 minutes, but many say that the initiative is yet to reach its potential.

When The Hindu went around the ORR on Tuesday, private vehicles, especially two-wheelers, were using the bus lane in the absence of a physical barrier and lack of constant vigilance.

K.G. Mohan of Bellandur Jothege, who commutes frequently on ORR, said that the agencies concerned cannot endlessly keep postponing the installation of bollards. “Due to the delay, lane discipline is quite bad, which naturally makes people think that the Bus Priority Lane is a failure,” he said adding that the work of installing bollards should have started as soon as the priority lane was introduced. He also added that of late, even BMTC buses were slowly moving out of the bus lane.

A BMTC bus driver said that buses deserved to move fast because they carry more people. “This will also encourage people to use public transport in cities like Bengaluru, which is notorious for traffic snarls. I do not understand why there is a delay in implementing steps that are vital for the success of a much-needed, positive project like the bus priority lane,” he said.

A marshal who was deployed to monitor the initiative said that they could do little to prevent people from driving on the priority lane. “We normally stand in the middle of the lane if we see other vehicles on the lane and divert them. However, once they get past us, they get back on the lane,” he said.

Srinivas Alavilli of Citizens for Bengaluru (CfB), which conducted the #NimbusExpress Bus Yatra to encourage people to use public transport, said that Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan recently assured them that the Bus Priority Lane “was there to stay” and that it would be extended to other high-density corridors soon.

“Initially, most of us opposed installation of bollards. However, now we are all for bollards. Once they are installed, the situation will definitely improve. Execution of the project is where we are lagging. Proper execution and use of technology by the police and the BMTC will definitely be a game changer,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/tbsmbb/article30916657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGBUSLANE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bus-priority-lane-starts-getting-physical-barriers/article30916658.ece

With over 4.2 million developers, India is the number one developer pool on the planet and undoubtedly, the country's tech capital, Bengaluru accounts for the largest number of them.

Redmond-based Microsoft had organised a tech summit in Bengaluru on Tuesday to celebrate both the professional and citizen developer communities, understand them, acknowledge their contribution, and also to offer them tips and tools for application development for the next decade.

Addressing over 700 developers, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said, “It is fantastic to be in Bengaluru. Talking to developers is my most favourite topic, and meeting them is a privilege as well for me.''

As per Nadella, just tech adoption and tech creation, and breaking the world is not going to work in the next decade. Young developers have a special role in introducing trust, ethical aspects and sustainability in everything they do, as these are based on the choices developers make.

“To me, the most highest leverage thing that we want to do for you is to empower you. We want to give you the best toolchain and the best leverage to make your dreams come true,” he told developers.

Anant Maheshwari, President, Microsoft India, said every company was a tech or digital company. India alone had around 3,00,000 companies that use technology and 75% of these companies were embracing cloud.

“And today, it’s the power of low code or no code programming that’s available in everybody's hands, and every person is a developer. It is amazing to see the power of tech,” said Maheshwari.

Future Decoded Tech Summit, a conclave for Indian developers, technologists and industry leaders, was beamed live on campuses of TCS, Wipro, HCL, Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys and ICICI. It was also beamed to 21 satellite campuses covering 35,000 attendees.

If navigating the city’s infamous traffic is a Herculean task, finding that coveted parking spot is equally daunting. But the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is getting ‘smart’ about this. The civic body will be introducing smart parking on 25 roads in the Central Business District (CBD), including M.G. Road and Church Street, in March.

This is the first phase of the smart parking system, which is to be introduced on 87 roads across the CBD grouped into categories A, B and C based on traffic volume. Initially, this system will be introduced on roads covered in Category A.

The pilot project was taken up on Kasturba Road two months ago. “Smart parking on Kasturba Road has streamlined parking and traffic movement. It has also helped motorists,” said a senior civic official.

However, the real test of this system will begin when it is introduced on 25 roads, as many of these roads are narrower, said a traffic police officer.

BBMP has taken up the project under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model and given a 20-year tender to Central Parking System (CPS) for managing paid parking on these roads. The civic body will get a share of the revenue.

The smart parking system will have demarcated parking slots for four-wheelers and two-wheelers that can even be pre-booked on a mobile app. The parking fee can be paid digitally or through cash at the smart meters on these roads. The fee has been fixed at ₹30 for four-wheelers and ₹20 for two-wheelers for an hour.

A case for off-street parking

Though the civic body’s proposal to introduce smart parking is aimed at decongesting the city’s roads, on-street parking has always been a contentious issue.

The erstwhile city corporation abolished parking fee in 2006 following allegations of corruption. The proposal to reintroduce a fee was made in 2011, which is being implemented only now.

The proposal continues to draw the ire of several urban mobility experts. “The roadway should be used solely for traffic movement and not for parking, especially given the congestion in the city,” traffic expert Prof. M.N. Srihari said.

The draft Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) for the city also argues for provision of more off-street parking rather than on-street parking facilities. The draft CMP includes an on-street parking survey at seven locations in the CBD. The survey showed on-street parking is dominated by two-wheelers and reduces the roadway in the range of 18%- 48%.

“On-street parking is affecting mobility with reduced road space available for the movement of traffic, and the manoeuvres of parked vehicles obstruct traffic flow, often leading to congestion,” the draft CMP notes.

The CMP argues for more public off-street parking facilities. The city has over 80 lakh vehicles today but only 14 off-street parking facilities while one is coming up at Freedom Park. The CMP says the present facilities provide parking for 1,300 cars and 4,000 two-wheelers, which is also underutilised as on-street parking is free.

The draft CMP proposes building 50 off-street parking facilities in the core areas.

The draft CMP also says: “As far as possible, on-street parking should not be allowed on major mobility travel corridors. Where space is available these need to be provided on the service road in an organised manner to limit the impact on traffic movement”.

‘Problem is in the fee’

Urban mobility expert Pawan Mulukutla said on-street parking need not be completely eliminated, but an appropriate pricing has to be arrived at. “Internationally, the accepted norm is that a suitable market pricing has to be discovered such that the utilisation rate is about 85%. It has to discourage private vehicles, and the cost of off-street parking must be less than on-street parking,” he said. “But, ₹30 for four-wheelers and ₹20 for two-wheelers per hour is very low, and not prohibitive,” he added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/2d1146/article30915740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGSMARTCARPARKING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/smart-parking-on-25-streets-in-cbd-from-march/article30915742.ece

386,2020/02/25,Parents accuse pre-primary schools of demanding exorbitant fees,"Some of them have filed a complaint with the Block Education Officer

The Department of Public Instruction (DPI) has received complaints that several pre-primary schools are charging exorbitant fees.

Parents have filed a complaint and have alleged that the fees for schools in and around the Varthur region range from ₹67,000 to ₹2 lakh for pre-primary classes, which include playgroup, nursery and kindergarten.

A group of eight parents who live in and around Varthur had lodged a complaint with the Block Education Officer South Range 4. Officials of the department have decided to inspect some of the pre-primary schools and later issue a show-cause notice if anyone is found to be violating the fee structure prescribed by the government.

Ayesha Thahaseen, who has a three-and-a-half-year-old daughter, said that parents are demanding a ‘reasonable fee structure’. “My daughter, who is in nursery, goes to her school from 9.30 a.m. to noon. Just for two-and-a-half hours, I pay ₹67,000 per annum. This is unacceptable on the part of school managements to charge such high fees,” she said.

Another parent, who has signed the complaint, said that they have collated the fee structure of 20 pre-primary classes, and the fee structure of all these classes is beyond the reach of middle-class families. “While officials of the department insist that private schools follow the fee structure and display it, pre-primary schools are not monitored. There is a need to ensure that they are regulated better,” the parent said.

According to the fee structure, other than recurring costs, managements can charge an additional fee that could differ based on the location, ranging from 70% of the recurring fee in gram panchayat and town panchayat limits to about 100% in Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike areas.

D. Hanumantharaya, Block Education Officer South Range 4, acknowledged receipt of a complaint and said that he had scheduled visits to three pre-primary schools next week.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/parents-accuse-pre-primary-schools-of-demanding-exorbitant-fees/article30915641.ece

On Monday, the Minister chaired a high-level meeting to discuss the issue arising out of the Supreme Court’s direction to the Centre to notify the tribunal award. Sources said that the decision to meet the Union Minister comes in the wake of reports that Goa is expected to go to the Supreme Court on an appeal against Thursday’s court direction.

Meanwhile, senior Congress leader H.K. Patil also urged the State government to move swiftly to get the gazette notification. He pointed out that Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has already announced the State’s intention to appeal against the order, and that the State government should bring pressure on the Centre to issue the gazette notification.

388,2020/02/25,Start-up RateMyStay to be launched today,"First project of Department of Professional Studies, CHRIST

The Department of Professional Studies (DPS), CHRIST (Deemed to be University) will launch its first start-up project ‘RateMyStay’ on Wednesday.

According to a release from the institution, this start-up will address a perennial problem faced by leading universities, colleges and students alike by reshaping the way hostels and other accommodation are selected.

Surveys

According to co-founder Amit Sarawagi, RateMyStay has surveys that rate hostels and Paying Guest students’ accommodation in and around colleges and universities on distinct parameters such as safety, security, health and hygiene, and facilities like WiFi, water supply and power back-up.

“With hundreds of hostels and other accommodation around every educational institution, physically checking and verifying the aforementioned parameters becomes nearly impossible. Hence, the technology team is developing this platform where rating becomes dynamic.

“The scores would not be static and can change every day,” he said.

“Hostels will have to be constantly diligent and alert in their services. The power to change the well-being of their stay now devolves to the in-mates (hostellers) and not necessarily the owners of the hostels,” says Monika Sarawagi, a team member of RateMyStay.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/start-up-ratemystay-to-be-launched-today/article30910126.ece
389,2020/02/25,Special team set up to probe all cases,"In Bengaluru alone, he was named in 47 criminal cases

Director General and Inspector General of Police Praveen Sood has formed a special team to probe all the cases related to Pujari.

Among the 47 cases registered in Bengaluru, there are some important cases including the murders of Shailaja and Ravi in the office of Shabnam Developers in Tilak Nagar in 2007.

His associates allegedly barged into offices in Mantri mall and of UTV, and opened fire after being refused ransom.

Pujari is an accused in the murder of builder Sujjaraju in Vyyalikaval in January 2001.

The accused would target businessmen, builders, VIPs and politicians for extortion. Claiming to be a ‘Hindu don’, Pujari would also threaten people who are active on social media, officials said. He had set up a local team to gather information about the victims, their family, wealth and business before making a call through the internet.

391,2020/02/25,HOPCOMS seeks ₹25 cr. interest-free loan from govt.,"To cash in on the increasing demand for fresh and naturally-ripened vegetables and fruits that come directly from the farm, the Horticultural Producers’ Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society Ltd. (HOPCOMS) has proposed the expansion of its services, including store upgrades, opening hi-tech outlets and creation of cold storage facility.

For this, HOPCOMS, with Karnataka State Cooperative Horticulture Marketing Federation Ltd, has requested Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to sanction a long-term interest-free loan of ₹25 crore and to allocate funds to HOPCOMS in the upcoming budget.

A.S. Chandre Gowda, president, HOPCOMS, said the government had always supported the infrastructural development of HOPCOMS, but did not concentrate on the marketing aspect.

“We operate on a ‘no profit-no loss basis’, so there has not been enough emphasis on business and ease of doing business,” he said, adding that if the government agreed to provide them with long-term interest-free loans and other financial assistance, they would invest it on improving business of the society.

Basavaraj R. Patil, president, Karnataka State Cooperative Horticulture Marketing Federation Ltd., said there was an urgent need to integrate cold chain facility, processing and sales. “Though efforts have been made to strengthen, expand and modernise HOPCOMS, we have lagged behind in integrating the important elements of processing, chain facility and sales. This is the biggest hindrance we are facing in competing with private players,” he said.

Mr. Patil also said that there was a need to open outlets for horticultural organic produce across the State, importantly in the city. “There has been demand from all districts, especially in Bengaluru, for organic commodities. Hence, we should aim at catering to new demands of the people,” he said.

An official from the federation also said that it should provide service like the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF). “They have different varieties of milk products. Though we procure different vegetables and fruits, we do not have any byproducts. Hence, we will seek the help of the government in extending and expanding our services. This will not only increase business but also help in tackling the wastage problem. Excess produce will be processed and sold,” the official said.

The federation has recently set up a grape processing unit in Vijayapura to convert grapes into raisins.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hopcoms-seeks-25-cr-interest-free-loan-from-govt/article30909986.ece

393,2020/02/25,"At DakshinaChitra, 70 years of political cartoons trace Indian democracy","An ongoing exhibition at DakshinaChitra traces seven decades of Indian democracy through political cartoons that focus on historic events

When the museum management interns at DakshinaChitra in Chennai brainstormed ideas for its ongoing exhibition, one recurrent theme that they landed on in their discussions was ‘democracy’. “We wondered how we could put forth such an abstract idea through an exhibition, without making it pedantic?” says Rituparna Pal, an intern.

Editorial cartooning would be their best bet, decided Rituparna, along with the team of 10 interns, she is part of. They then put together Cartoon-o-cracy, an exhibition that traces seven decades of Indian democracy through political cartoons. The team collected cartoons from 1950 to 2020, each decade getting its separate section. The post-2010 period has an entire collage to itself — “For post 2010, we have done a collage of cartoons to signify the boom in digital media and to show that political cartooning is not confined to the newsroom anymore,” says Rituparna.

The cartoons focus on historic events that have been important for our democracy or may have threatened the republic in any way. “We have highlighted how cartoonists have chosen to respond to these events. During the ’50s, Shankar was the towering figure, and we have displayed his portrayal of Nehru’s dilemmas. At the same time, there are the cartoons of BR Ambedkar which are problematic. We noted how even cartoonists are not free from prejudices,” she says.

In the 1970s, with the Emergency under Indira Gandhi’s rule being one of the most noteworthy events, the cartoons highlight Abu Abraham’s Private View on Indian Express and the stamp of censorship on them, besides criticism of other Government policies such as compulsory vasectomy.

The 1990s saw the demolition of the Babri Masjid, propelling a chain reaction of events which determine our country’s secular fabric even today. Caricatures of LK Advani and his ratha yatra by RK Laxman is one of the many cartoons displayed in this section.

“We could not include regional artists due to constraints of time and space. So we focussed on national cartoonists like Shankar, Kutty, Abu Abraham, OV Vijayan, RK Lakshman, Maya Kamath, Mita Roy, Rajinder Puri, EP Unny, Ajit Ninan, Aseem Trivedi, and Surendra,” she says. The team then gathered the cartoons from online sources and categorised them into different themes such as political, economic, social and entertainment.

“Then came the most difficult task of finding the dates and the sources of the cartoons,” she says, adding that they referred to Ritu Gairola Khanduri’s Caricaturing Culture in India: Cartoons and History in the Modern World and Unnamati Syama Sundar’s No Laughing Matter: The Ambedkar Cartoons 1932-1956, among others.

The exhibition will also screen two short films. One of them is is, Don’t Spare Me Shankar, by Gurcharan Singh. The other one is about the Propaganda model, postulated by American activist and linguist Noam Chomsky, which says that the mass media goes through five filters of ownership, funding, sourcing, facing flak, and the fear ideology.

“Cartoons, as a form of art, can evade these traps and put forward arrays of opinions that exist in society,” says Sreya Mukherjee, another intern who worked on researching for, and curating cartoons for the exhibition. “No matter what governments have done, cartoonists have made sure democracy is kept alive. The small corner that they occupy in the newspaper is pivotal for us. Through just a few strokes here and there, they have made sure that we have our freedom of expression.”

Cartoon-o-cracy is ongoing at Kadambari Art Gallery, DakshinaChitra until March 5.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/p0g26l/article30913891.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPCartoon5jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/at-dakshinachitra-70-years-of-political-cartoons-trace-indian-democracy/article30913893.ece

For the first time, the Philatelic Bureau, Anna Road Head Post Office, is hosting the philately collections of students.

The collections of 228 students from 12 schools is on display at ‘Clubfest 2020’, a month-long philatelic exhibition. The Department of Posts organised the exhibition as a step to promote philately among schoolchildren. Of the 227 philately clubs opened in schools, nearly 160 are in Chennai.

The members of these philately clubs are encouraged to collect stamps and also trained in exhibiting their collection through workshops. They get to learn how to sequence stamps that could tell a story and showcase them in a theme. M. Sampath, Chief Postmaster General, Tamil Nadu Circle, had earlier released a special cover on the occasion of the display.

Officials of the Postal Department said nearly 270 entries were received from members of philately clubs. The chosen students were given an opportunity to showcase their stamp collection.

398,2020/02/25,Perungudi and Kodungaiyur yards | A way out of dumping garbage,"This is touted as a solution to stop dumping of waste in Perungudi and Kodungaiyur yards.

The delayed solid waste incineration project has gone on stream in Chennai. This is touted as a solution to stop dumping of waste in Perungudi and Kodungaiyur yards.

* The first place to get an incinerator is Manali, with a capacity to process 10 tonnes of garbage a day

* Six more localities in the city will get 100-tonne capacity waste incinerators

* The Corporation has called for tenders to install incinerators in Sathangadu in Tiruvottiyur zone, Kodungaiyur in Tondiarpet zone, Ayanavaram in Thiru Vi Ka Nagar zone, Ambattur, Mylapore Burial Ground in Teynampet zone and Pallikaranai in Perungudi zone

Process of incineration

1. Unloading garbage from trucks at the plant

2. Segregation of waste in a chamber

3. Bio-degradable waste will be composted at a facility on the premises

4. Shredding of non-biodegradable waste

5. Heating of such waste to over 1025 degree Celsius in a furnace after removing moisture and injecting oxygen; no external fuel will be used

6. Collection of ash, a part of which will be used to make bricks

7. Passage of exhaust through a pollution control unit to release only water vapour into the atmosphere

Byproducts of incineration

Paver bricks

* One tonne of incinerated waste will yield 20-30 kg of ash

* The ash will be converted into paver bricks in the ratio of 40% ash and 60% stone chips

* One tonne of waste will thus yield 60 kg of bricks

Fly ash with carbon (0.1% to 0.2%)

Fly ash with 0.1% to 0.2% carbon content and weighing 2 kg will also be produced by a tonne of waste; the fly ash will be used in agriculture

Activated carbon

Approximately one kg of activated carbon will also be produced in the plant. Activated carbon is used in sewage treatment, metal extraction, gold purification and medicine

Benefits of incineration

* Reduction of landfill sites

* Existing dump yards will be converted into parks and recreation centres

* Reduction of groundwater pollution in residential areas near dump yards

Negatives

Residents in thickly populated areas such as Mylapore, Ayanavaram and Ambattur are expected to oppose the project because of pollution

Existing state of waste management

Chennai generates 5,000 tonnes of municipal soild waste, which is dumped in Perungudi and Kodungaiyur. The Pallikaranai marshland has been polluted by the Perungudi dump yard. Residents have been opposing the dumping of waste over the past few years. Once dumping of waste is stopped in Perungudi, ecorestoration of the marshland will be successful",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/nid625/article30907948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WASTEPROCESSOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/perungudi-and-kodungaiyur-yards-a-way-out-of-dumping-garbage/article30907949.ece

401,2020/02/25,‘Technology can make police accountable’,"Former CBI director delivers lecture

Former director of the CBI, R.K. Raghavan, on Monday said that technological developments such as body cameras would help bring in discipline and prevent misconduct among police personnel.

Mr. Raghavan expressed his views while delivering a lecture on ‘Managing police forces in India and the role of technology’, organised by the Department of Management Studies at the University of Madras.

He said that technology would be highly useful for the government. The recent decades have seen the emergence of a number of technologies such as cellphones, CCTV cameras and DNA testing, and now more recently, artificial intelligence.

“The technologies can be used to help the police in several ways, and can be used for personnel management as well. The police for can use the technologies to make themselves more accountable and useful to the community,” he said.

Mr. Raghavan added that the police should not be considered a force, but a public service. Laying emphasis on the use of technology, he said a better use of technology would help the police understand the need to be more efficient.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/technology-can-make-police-accountable/article30907806.ece
402,2020/02/25,"Improve safety features on highways, says DMK MP","Member of Parliament Dayanidhi Maran urged the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to take immediate action to improve safety provisions on all highways on a war-footing.

In a recent letter to Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, he recalled the recent accident on the NH 544 st Avinashi in Tiruppur, where several persons died.

He said the deaths could have been avoided if the roads were maintained and proper safety measures like guardrails and well-planned medians were in place.

He sought to know how the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) could think a foot-high median was enough for a six-lane highway such as NH 544, which is an important passenger and commercial route with high-speed heavy vehicular movement. He said the blame for the accident lay squarely on the Ministry and the NHAI, which had not taken steps to ensure better safety standards.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/improve-safety-features-on-highways-says-dmk-mp/article30907804.ece
403,2020/02/25,Avadi’s selfie point to promote a litter-free zone,"No outing is complete without capturing those special moments on camera.

The Avadi Municipal Corporation will soon set up a dedicated selfie point on N.M. Road and TNHB Main Road junction for people to express their love for the locality and drive home the message of litter-free zones.

The Corporation has joined hands with Poompuhar Handicrafts to set up the selfie point, as part of its beautification drive. In about a week, the junction will have a typography installation, bearing the phrase ‘I Love Avadi’, ready for people to click selfies.

N. Ravichandran, Avadi Municipal Corporation Commissioner, said the installation would be designed by Poompuhar Handicrafts and a water fountain would also be put in place. The project will be executed at a cost of ₹20 lakh. There are plans to have more selfie points based on patronage.

Taking its efforts to maintain a clean environment to another level, the Corporation plans to evoke interest among people about keeping the area free from garbage and develop a sense of ownership among them, he said.

To make fitness affordable and a part of the residents’ lifestyle, the Corporation will open 16 open-air gyms in its parks, each at a cost of ₹10 lakh. Some areas where open-air gyms are set to come up include TNHB park, Tirumullaivoyal, Paruthipattu, TNHB area, Avadi, Kavarapalayam, Ashok Niranjan Nagar and Thendral Nagar. Mr. Ravichandran said that gym equipment was being installed in the parks. People can use the facilities for free.

404,2020/02/25,When Chennai played host to a U.S. Vice-President,"Richard Nixon began his tour to the country in 1953 from the city

Chennai has never received the President of the United States of America, but has played host to a serving Vice-President once, in November 1953.

Richard M. Nixon, who served as Vice-President during the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953-61), began his five-day tour to the country from Chennai.

Though Nixon, accompanied by his wife Patricia Ryan Nixon, stayed in the city for five hours, he had an important engagement — a meeting with the then Chief Minister of Madras, C. Rajagopalachari, at the Raj Bhavan. The discussion between the two leaders lasted 90 minutes, at the end of which Nixon said he had “benefited greatly” by the meeting. He went on to describe Rajaji as an “infinitely wise man,” according to a report published by The Hindu on November 30, 1953. When the two leaders emerged from the meeting, Sri Prakasa, the then Governor, remarked “quite a long talk it has been”. Nixon’s response was: “And, quite a nice talk too.” Rajaji’s take was humorous, as he said: “I think I was trying to govern the U.S. and Mr. Nixon trying to govern India.”

While the Chief Minister did not reveal much about the discussion to journalists, except saying that it was “just an after-lunch chat and was quite pleasant”. Nixon pointed out that they covered “a very broad range of subjects and not merely local problems.”

Patricia Nixon visited the YMCA Boys Town, Fort, where she spent an hour. Later, the American couple left for Bengaluru. Though Nixon, as President, came to India in 1969, he went only to New Delhi, where he spent less than a day.

Chennai had to wait for nearly 60 years for the visit a high-profile incumbent dignitary. In July 2011, Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, came to Chennai and attended a couple of events. At Fort St. George, she met the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.

Two more prominent leaders visited Tamil Nadu in the last 20 years, after they demitted the constitutional offices. Bill Clinton, former President, visited Nagapattinam in May 2005 and Cuddalore in December 2006 to study experiences of tsunami-hit people.

In October 2010, Al Gore, who was Vice-President during the presidency of Mr. Clinton, came to Chennai to deliver a talk.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ubowxq/article30907789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25thnixon,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/when-chennai-played-host-to-a-us-vice-president/article30907790.ece
405,2020/02/25,VGP dispute: arbitrator’s order set aside,"The Madras High Court on Monday set aside an order passed by a court-appointed arbitrator, permitting Shanthi Gnanasekaran, daughter of famous businessman V.G. Panneerdas, to get included as a party in a pending arbitration proceeding related to a dispute between the present partners of VGP Beach Housing.

Justice S.M. Subramaniam, by a common order, allowed individual appeals filed by V.G. Santhosam, V.G.P. Ravidas, V.G.P. Rajadas and V.G.P. Babudas against the arbitrator’s decision to allow Ms. Gnanasekaran to get included as a party to the proceedings, though she was not a partner in the company.

The judge pointed out that VGP Beach Housing was originally formed on March 27, 1979, by Panneerdas and four other partners. In 1982, the partnership firm was reconstituted with the induction of two more members and upon the death of Panneerdas in 1988, his wife Parijatham became the sole successor of his share in the profits.

In 1992, Parijatham too died after nominating V.G.P. Ravidas as her nominee. Subsequently, the partnership firm was reconstituted multiple times until a dispute arose between the partners and got referred for arbitration. The High Court had appointed a retired judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court as the arbitrator.

When the matter stood thus, Ms. Gnanasekaran filed an impleading petition before the arbitrator, claiming to have inherited the right of her father in the company and her plea was allowed, forcing some partners to approach the court. Allowing their appeals, Justice Subramaniam held that an arbitrator had no power to include a third party.

The judge said that Ms. Gnanasekaran would have to establish her claim only before a civil court and not before the arbitrator.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vgp-dispute-arbitrators-order-set-aside/article30907785.ece
406,2020/02/25,Registration dept. secretary summoned by Madras HC,"HC seeks explanation on transfer

The Madras High Court on Monday summoned the Registration department secretary to explain the circumstances under which a District Registrar, who was transferred from a sensitive post at the Sub Registrar’s office at Villivakkam in Chennai to a non-sensitive post in Thoothukudi following a vigilance raid, was transferred back to Chengalpattu in four months.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha directed the Secretary to be present in the court on Thursday along with the relevant files. The interim direction was issued on a public interest litigation petition filed by Karuppu Ezhuthu Kazhagam, a private organisation, to quash a Government Order issued on July 5 last year transferring various officials.

The petitioner’s counsel P. Vijendran claimed that corruption was rampant in the Registration department. He alleged that highly corrupt officials in the department were allowed to retire from service scot-free, while those facing comparatively less serious charges were being subject to much serious punishment.

A case in point was that of District Registrar K. Gopalakrishnan, who was trasferred from Chennai to Thoothukudi after a raid in March 2019.

Claiming that the officer did not join service at the transferred location, the petitioner said he was transferred to Chengalpattu within four months. Further, stating that the official’s name had been included in a general list of transfer of various other officers in July last, the petitioner urged the court to quash the entire GO and consequently direct the State government to effect the transfers in a transparent manner.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/registration-dept-secretary-summoned-by-madras-hc/article30907783.ece
407,2020/02/25,OMCs ready to supply BS-VI fuel,"IOCL is already selling ‘ClearBlue’ diesel exhaust fluid

The State-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) are prepared and geared up to supply Bharat Stage-VI fuel in Tamil Nadu.

Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), the market leader in the State, has already begun supplies through most of its 2,300-odd retail outlets.

Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL) too will commence supplies from the first week of March, IOCL executive director and State oil industry coordinator P. Jayadevan told reporters on Monday.

Low sulphur content

The supply of BS VI fuel, which has low sulphur content (a climb down of sulphur content from 50 ppm to 10 ppm), has been mandated from April 1.

This was being done to reduce the sulphur content in the underground tanks of the retail outlets. IOCL sells around 1,24,900 KL of petrol and 2,10,700 KL of diesel a month in the State.

Mr. Jayadevan said that Indian Oil’s ClearBlue diesel exhaust fluid, to be used by all BS-VI diesel commercial vehicles to reduce nitrogen oxides, has hit the market. The company is BS-VI compliant as far as high-octane and branded fuels are concerned.

On City Gas Distribution Network, he said that by next year, Chennai would most likely get its first connection.

“It is a question of gas availability. As far as Salem and Coimbatore where IOCL has the contract, a final time line cannot be given. A satellite LNG Station is being considered at Irugur for Coimbatore and near Salem Steel Plant for Salem. Permissions are obtained for laying of steel pipelines along the Highways and the work is in progress,” he added.

Refill by WhatsApp

For its LPG consumers, the IOCL has launched a new refill booking system through WhatsApp by which they can book Indane refills by typing “REFILL” from their registered number to 75888-88824, he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/omcs-ready-to-supply-bs-vi-fuel/article30907771.ece

The former vice-chairperson of Tata Consultancy Services, S. Ramadorai, has been appointed chairperson of the Kalakshetra Foundation’s governing board by the Union Ministry of Culture.

The Ministry appointed Mr. Ramadorai for a term of five years, according to a notification issued on February 18.

He has earlier served as the Prime Minister’s advisor in the National Skill Development Council and the chief of the National Skill Development Agency.

On February 18, the government also appointed three artistes — Anupama Hoskere, Neyveli Santhanagopalan and Sudha Ragunathan — to fill vacancies on the board for its current term that is till November 9. Ms. Hoskere is a director of puppet theatre as well as a Bharatanatyam dancer and had been appointed as a board member in place of S. Saumya. Mr. Santhanagopalan and Dr. Raghunathan are Carnatic vocalists who have been appointed to replace Gangai Amaren and the late C.K. Balagopalan, respectively.

The foundation had stirred a controversy last month when it rescinded permission for the book release of Carnatic vocalist T.M.

410,2020/02/25,Students in slum tenements to get a feel of the museum,"Visits for students from classes VI -X to start on Feb. 29

A novel project is set to kick off at the Egmore Museum, with students living in slum board tenements in far-flung and resettled areas, like Perumbakkam and the surrounding clusters, getting a feel of the museum every week.

The first batch of around 150 students from these areas will visit the museum on February 29, and officials hope to continue this every week, so that the children get to learn about the museum’s history and its artefacts.

“Slum clearance board officials will choose the students and bring them to the museum. On February 29, we have planned to bring 150 students, in two buses, take them on a tour around the museum, educate them about the museum’s history, its various galleries and their specialities,” an official told The Hindu.

While student tours of the museum are a regular feature, the initiative is likely to kindle interest in museology and archaeology among these children, the official added. The tour will be held for students from classes VI to X, the official added.

Rani, a parent in Perumbakkam, said children in the resettled colonies in the southern parts of Chennai do not have many entertainment options or educational opportunities. “The trips should be conducted on a regular basis. The science vans should also be brought to our areas so that the children can be moulded to do greater things,” she said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/p5qbjw/article30907736.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THMUSEUM1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/students-in-slum-tenements-to-get-a-feel-of-the-museum/article30907737.ece
411,2020/02/25,Arappor Iyakkam allegesharassment of whistleblower,"Chandrabose, a contractor, is served a demolition notice for his house

Arappor Iyakkam has alleged that a whistleblower who helped NGOs release data on corruption in the Chennai Corporation has been threatened by civic officials.

According to a press release, Arappor Iyakkam exposed corruption in the Corporation in 2018, with many contractors admitting that tenders were prefixed and they had been fighting for an open and transparent tendering process.

“One such person is Chandrabose, who is also a witness in the corruption complaints given by Arappor Iyakkam. He has also brought out videos on how Corporation officials refuse to accept the deposit DD for other contractors. He received an envelope by registered post from the Corporation at his residence on February 6, 2020, and at his other property on February 5, 2020. The envelopes contained three letters — one was a de-occupation notice asking him to vacate his residence in 15 days, dated February 4, 2020; another letter contained lock and seal and demolition notices dated January 29, 2020; the third notice called for an approved plan, dated January 8, 2020. All three original notices were sent together in one post,” said the release.

Caught on camera

“Normally, the procedure is that the Corporation seeks a plan copy, and if the plan copy is not available, then they will send lock and seal and demolition notices. A de-occupation notice is sent later. Even though he possesses a valid plan approval for both his properties, he was served all three notices together, at one go. To fabricate and create records that these notices have been served earlier, Corporation officials came to his residence on February 4, 2020, pasted the notice on the gate, then took photographs of it before tearing it up and leaving. However, they were not aware that CCTV cameras, installed by the Commissioner of Police, would record it. Violators of the law were caught red-handed on camera,” said the press release.

“Mr. Chandrabose has been threatened that his 17-year-old house, with plan approval, would be demolished if he remains a witness in Arappor’s complaint. The Madras High Court has given an interim stay on the notices. Mr. Chandrabose has also written to the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) seeking protection and action on officials,” said the release.

Senior civic officials said that they would conduct an inquiry on the allegations relating to the contractor.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/arappor-iyakkam-alleges-harassment-of-whistleblower/article30907725.ece
412,2020/02/25,KMC to get new block under healthcare project,"Building will have emergency ward, ICUs

The city’s health infrastructure is all set to get a new addition under the Tamil Nadu Urban Healthcare Project (TNUHP).

The Government Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) Hospital will get a six-storey building that will have an emergency ward, intensive care units (ICU), including units for burns and neurology/stroke, and two floors exclusively for operation theatres.

The objective of the project is to upgrade tertiary-care hospitals such as the KMC. Two more government medical college hospitals in Madurai and Coimbatore are also being upgraded. Under the TNUHP, supported by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, funds to the tune of ₹275.59 crore were allotted for KMC — ₹141.41 crore for the building and ₹134.18 crore for equipment.

The ground floor of the proposed building will have emergency and triage, while a poison ICU and an endoscopy unit have been planned on the first floor. “We will have burns ICU along with a ward on the second floor. This will be in addition to the existing burns ward at KMC. Through an additional facility, we want to improve the infrastructure and treatment component,” said a senior doctor.

The surgical ICU will be located on the third floor, followed by an IMCU, a dialysis unit and nephrology and urology surgical wards on the fourth floor. Authorities said the fifth and sixth floors would have 12 operation theatres with six on each floor.

414,2020/02/25,Traffic disrupted as sewer pipeline bursts,"Leakage a recurrent problem on K.K. Nagar stretch: officials

Residents of K.K. Nagar had a tough time negotiating the Anna Main Road on Monday, as traffic was diverted for major repair work on the sewer network under the arterial road.

On Sunday, the sewer pipeline below the road collapsed, leading to sewage overflow on to the road.

According to Metrowater officials, the main sewer line, carrying sewage from areas such as Saidapet and Ekkatuthangal, was damaged due to unknown reasons.

The pumping of sewage from Saidapet to the Nesapakkam pumping station was stopped on Sunday.

Only one-way traffic was allowed, as a portion of the road was cordoned off to carry out repairs.

“We will know the cause of the leak after the earth work is completed. The leakage has been a recurrent problem on the stretch,” said a Metrowater official. Leakage was reported at other spots along the same stretch in past years.

Officials said that the pipeline was located at a depth of 8 m and sewage on the road was being pumped out. A large pit was dug up to locate the problem that led to the caving in of a portion of the road, officials said.

Once the extent of damage and the type of repairs are ascertained, measures for a permanent solution to the frequent collapse of the network on the stretch would be taken up, including enlargement of the pipeline’s capacity, said Metrowater officials.

“Work is being taken up round-the-clock for speedy rectification and to reduce inconvenience to residents,” a senior official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fm4b8k/article30907669.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THSEWER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/traffic-disrupted-as-sewer-pipeline-bursts/article30907670.ece

416,2020/02/25,The unassailable keywords for the judiciary,"India’s judges must remind themselves constantly of the need to uphold an independent, strong and respected judiciary

Justice Arun Mishra’s public praise of the Prime Minister at a public forum on Saturday raises serious questions about the independence of the judiciary. What is more disturbing is that he was speaking at the inaugural session of the International Judicial Conference 2020, ‘Judiciary and the Changing World’. The damage his statement has caused is incalculable. The international judicial community must have been left aghast as far as the very independence of the Indian judiciary is concerned. Judges across India must be left bewildered wondering whether they should indulge in similar praises or not. One cannot forget that Justice Mishra is one of the seniormost judges of the Supreme Court of India and every word spoken by him may be taken seriously by those connected with the administration of justice.

The Prime Minister himself applauded the Supreme Court by referring to some recent “critical judgments”, adding that 1.3 billion Indians wholeheartedly accepted the judicial verdicts. The Prime Minister’s claim certainly appears to be off the mark considering that large numbers have questioned these judgments.

The Law Minister, who was also speaking at the inaugural session, himself took the opportunity to attack many of those who criticise the functioning of the judiciary and its judgments. The Executive and the Judiciary appear to be in tandem, something which was clearly not designed under the Constitution. Was the international conference a platform for these?

Reiterating independence

In a 1981 judgment, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court held that “Judges should be stern stuff and tough fire, unbending before power, economic or political, and they must uphold the core principle of the rule of law which says: ‘Be you ever so high, the law is above you.’. This is the principle of independence of the judiciary which is vital for the establishment of real participatory democracy, maintenance of the rule of law as a dynamic concept and delivery of social justice to the vulnerable sections of the community. It is this principle of independence of the judiciary which we must keep in mind while interpreting the relevant provisions of the Constitution.”

In the same judgment another learned judge holds, “...While the administration of justice draws its legal sanction from the Constitution, its credibility rests in the faith of the people. Indispensable to that faith is the independence of the judiciary... the framers of the Constitution took great pains to ensure that an even better and more effective judicial structure was incorporated in the Constitution, one which would meet the highest expectations of judicial independence....”

That structure seems to be crumbling under its own weight.

Later in 1993, another Constitution Bench in the Second Judges Appointment Case, declared: “It is obvious that only those persons should be considered fit for appointment as Judges of the superior judiciary who combine the attributes essential for making an able, independent and fearless judge. Several attributes together combine to constitute such a personality. Legal expertise, ability to handle cases, proper personal conduct and ethical behaviour, firmness and fearlessness are obvious essential attributes of a person suitable for appointment as a superior Judge.”

Standard of conduct

Among the several attributes that have been prescribed of a judge is “proper personal conduct”.

In a case in 1995, C. Ravichandran Iyer v. Justice A.M. Bhattacharjee & Ors., the Supreme Court went to the extent of holding that for a judge, “the standard of conduct is higher than that expected of layman” and that “therefore the judge can ill-afford to seek shelter from the fallen standard in society”.

It was also declared, “The Judges of higher echelons, therefore, should not be mere men of clay with all the frailties and foibles, human failings and weak character which may be found in those in other walks of life. They should be men of fighting faith with tough fibre not susceptible to any pressure, economic, political or any sort.”.

It concluded, “In short, the behaviour of the Judge is the bastion for the people to reap the fruits of the democracy, liberty and justice and the antithesis rocks the bottom of the rule of law.”

Ironically, Justice Mishra himself in a judgment in R. Muthukrishnan versus The Registrar General Of The High Court Of Judicature At Madras observes, “Judicial independence is a privilege of and protection for the people.”

He holds, “Francis Bacon has said about the Judges that Judges ought to be more learned than witty, more reverend than plausible, and more advised than confident. Above all things, integrity is their potion and proper virtue. .... The balancing of values, reverence between the Bar and the Bench is the edifice of the independent judicial system. Time has come to restore the glory and cherish the time-tested enduring ideals and principles.”

He also says, “Independent Bar and Independent Bench form the backbone of the democracy.” So why these remarks about the country’s leader?

Key judicial charter

So, what can a citizen make out of this completely avoidable public praise by such a senior judge? Have those in positions of responsibility and even others who have publicly praised the Prime Minister in the recent past forgotten the Charter called “The Restatement of Values of Judicial Life”? This was adopted by the full Court, in 1997, to serve as a guide to be observed by the judges which, according to the charter, was “essential for an independent, strong and respected judiciary, indispensable in the impartial administration of justice”. The Charter is “a complete code of the canons of judicial ethics” and categorically declares among many others the following values: “6. A Judge should practise a degree of aloofness consistent with the dignity of his office” and “16. Every Judge must at all times be conscious that he is under the public gaze and there should be no act or omission by him which is unbecoming of the high office he occupies and the public esteem in which the office is held.” To my mind, both stand violated now.

In a Constituent Assembly Debate, Professor K.T. Shah (Bihar) spoke of the dangers lying ahead on May 24, 1949: “In my opinion, Sir, if I may so with all respect, this Constitution concentrates so much power and influence in the hands of the Prime Minister in regard to the appointment of judges, ambassadors, or Governors to such an extent, that there is every danger to apprehend that the Prime Minister may become a Dictator if he chooses to do so. I think there are cases which ought to be removed from the political influence, of party manoeuvres. And here is one case, viz. Judges of the Supreme Court, who I think should be completely outside that influence.”

He again said, “I have been trying to lay before the Houses viz., or keeping the Judiciary completely out of any temptation, and contact with the executive or the legislative side. Whether during his tenure of office... or even on retirement, I would suggest that there should be a constitutional prohibition against his employment in any executive office, so that no temptation should be available to a judge for greater emoluments, or greater prestige which would in any way affect his independence as a judge.”

One thing is clear, the judiciary is fast eroding the hopes and aspirations of great men and women who sat in the Constituent Assembly debating and giving us the great document, the Constitution of India. Any correction, if at all, must come from within the judiciary. Will it? We the Citizens of India can only sit back and watch bemused and deeply disappointed.

418,2020/02/25,The clock of demographic dividend,"It is unfortunate that our country has had no plans to take advantage of the demographic dividend available for a limited period of about 50 years, possibly ending in 2050s (Editorial page, “ Youth can be a clear advantage for India,” Feb. 24). Indian economy has been on the downturn and unemployment has been on the rise. Let alone the country taking advantage of demographic dividend, even the normal employment opportunities are disappearing due to faulty economic policies. Even if the economy turns for better, Indian youth have been found to be woefully short of employable skills. Already, a precious 15 years have been lost. At least, the remaining period of 3-4 decades should be utilised with foresight, if the country is not to lose the advantage of the demographic dividend. While making all-out efforts through suitable policy measures to put the economy back on track and on an accelerated growth path, it is imperative that a plan of action to improve the educational system, including improving the employability of the youth, is prepared and implemented urgently. Opening a large number of vocational training institutions and imparting employable skills to students exiting engineering, polytechnic and other degree colleges are some of the measures to be taken on priority. Apart from creating the ecosystem that provides congenial climate for private sector investment, which has not been encouraging for the last few years, public investments/finance should be hugely stepped up, especially in the infrastructure and SME sectors, to shore up and put the economy back on rails. The investments should be so planned that they have maximum positive impact on the unorganised sector, which absorbs a large number of the youth leaving schools and junior colleges. The government should wake up before the demographic dividend turns into a demographic disaster.

420,2020/02/25,A sitting judge praises the PM,"This refers to the news “Mishra draws flak for praising PM” (Feb. 24). Judiciary is entrusted with providing justice without bias, partiality or favouritism. But, to the contrary, Justice Arun Mishra threw all caution to the winds and was all praise for Prime Minister Modi while addressing a gathering of judges from foreign countries, the act of which has not only belittled his reputation as a sitting judge in the Supreme Court, it also dwarfed the stature of Indian judiciary. The Collegium of the Supreme Court should consider removing him or retiring him compulsorily forthwith.

Manoharan Muthuswamy

Ramanathapuram, Tamil Nadu

By praising the Prime Minister, Justice Mishra has sullied and degraded his post, ignoring the fact that the judiciary is independent. Such acts by judges make people lose confidence in the judiciary. Justice Mishra should now recuse himself from all cases involving the government, as clouds of suspicion will hover on his future verdicts. It will be relevant here to quote author and diplomat, Caroline Kennedy: “The bed lock of our democracy is the rule of law and that means we have to have an independent judiciary, judges who can make decisions independent of political winds that are blowing”.

423,2020/02/25,Trump in India,"Bitterly stung by recent election reverses in States like Jharkhand and Delhi, the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance government has a lot at stake as far as the visit of the U.S. President Donald Trump is concerned. The Central government is optimistic that a number of deals would be inked, though Mr. Trump before his departure almost queered the pitch by criticising the high trade tariffs in India that have hurt U.S. exports. Plenty of store is also being placed on the bonhomie between the two leaders though in the final analysis it would count for nothing if Mr. Modi fails to negotiate a good deal for his country. Mr. Modi also faces the prospect of being queried on controversial topics like the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, religious freedom and Kashmir, which he may not relish. With Mr. Trump’s visit having been hyped up beyond all measure, there would be virtually no gains for the government unless there are some tangible results to show.

C.V. Aravind,

Bengaluru

As a leader who fancies himself, Mr. Trump must have been overwhelmed by the rousing reception he got en route to and in the packed Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad. The milling crowd did not appear to be in millions, though. An astute businessman-cum-politician, Mr. Trump pushed all the right buttons. He stated that India has a ‘true and trusted friend’ in America. He professed America’s love and respect for India. He declared that India’s economic progress in the last 70 years gives hope to all of humanity, but he skirted the issue of the current economic slowdown in India. He mentioned en passant that American economy was ‘booming like never before’ with a self-satisfied smirk on his face.

President Trump left nothing untouched; he referred to Bollywood, Deepavali and Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli. He remembered to mention the contributions of Indian Americans to his ‘beloved country’ in a bid to woo them. He saw India as a ‘major market’ for America. He was eager to make trade and defence agreements with India. He would supply India ‘most feared arms’. He omitted to mention his ending Indian preferential trade status. It was a gem from him that the true strength of India lies in the hearts of its people.

At the iconic Sabarmati Ashram he tried his hand at spinning the charkha. While scribbling thanks to his friend Mr. Modi for his ‘kindness and hospitality’, he did not write a word in praise of Mahatma Gandhi. The picture perfect Namaste Trump event in the cricket stadium with the spotlight on the Trump-Modi pair was a visual treat to us. The bonhomie between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, almost indistinguishable from each other was in full display. Both have an inflated sense of their own importance and a weakness for publicity. It is apt to describe them ‘birds of a feather’.

While taking the whole country by storm, the hyped-up Trump visit has also mirrored what kind of a nation we have become. It was a shame that a wall was erected to hide the slums — a poor advertisement for an Incredible India — from Mr. Trump’s sight. It was a shame that it was done in the land of Mahatma Gandhi. It is not quite clear how Mr. Trump’s visit that exacted a splurge on sprucing up the spots in his itinerary will herald acche din.

424,2020/02/25,Chef Vikram Vij’s modern Indian food boasts of Canadian ingredients and French techniques,"Four restaurants, food trucks and an all-woman Punjabi workforce... India-born, Vancouver-based Chef Vikram Vij on his journey in the culinary world

In Vancouver, Vikram Vij is a culinary rockstar. Diners line up outside his restaurants, even in biting cold, fortified by masala chai, for his signature cooking. His food has won multiple awards, drawing press and TV personalities from across the world, including the late Antony Bourdain and Giada De Laurentiis. He runs four restaurants, and a food truck, Vij’s Railway Express. He’s also released cookbooks, and has a line of frozen, ready-to-eat food.

In Chennai, Vikram is anonymous. India after all, is more familiar with British, European, and American celebrity chefs, thanks to TV and Netflix. Nevertheless, Vikram is impossible to overlook, with his big personality, flamboyant energy and gender-fluid nose ring, accentuated by jingling bracelets.

Beyond labels

In life and cooking, Vikram resists labels. “I am not an Indian chef,” he says, settling down for a chat over dinner. “I am a classically trained French chef. I put myself on a plate: I am India born, using Canadian ingredients and French techniques.”

He pauses to spear a coconut prawn with his fork: dinner is at Zhouyu, the Chinese restaurant newly launched by Chindi Varadarajulu. Chindi grew up in Singapore and then moved to Vancouver to open a South Indian restaurant, called Chutney Villa, after which she began travelling to India with food tour groups. She ended up settling down in Chennai in 2012, opening Pumpkin Tales, and now Zhouyu.

Vikram also hosts culinary tours, and is now travelling through South India with a group of Canadians. At Zhouyu, his group chats animatedly about their day at a local market and the joys of eating freshly made porottas. Since it is a private dinner, Chindi has got her chefs to made crisp vadais. After all, with people who truly love food, cuisines do not need to be categorised. And rules are meant to be broken.

Which is why, as a 19-year-old who wanted to cook for a living, Vikram realised that he needed to leave the country to develop an independent culinary style. “I could not do this being in India. I needed validation from outside to be taken seriously here,” he says matter of factly, adding, “I needed to learn European techniques. I needed to learn French. I had to become a certified sommelier.”

In 1983, Vikram left home in Amritsar, to study Hotel Management in Salzburg, Austria. After working in Salzburg and Vienna, he moved to Canada in 1989 and opened his first restaurant, Vij’s, in Vancouver, plating up a style of Indian food influenced by his roots but not dictated by them. “I never followed family recipes, though they were embedded in my mind. I took those flavours and modernised them,” he says. “When I opened, I thought: I won’t be like all the other Indian restaurants. I won’t call this Taj Mahal. I won’t even say authentic Indian. After all, who defines authenticity?”

Vij’s opened with 18 seats and a staff of one person: Vikram. “When my parents came to visit from India, papa sold some property and brought me money in a brown paper bag! My mother wanted me to serve the best chicken curry possible, so she made it at home, and brought it to my restaurant on the bus balancing it on her knees all the way.”

His menu, however, was modern Indian. “I serve a rack of lamb marinated in mustard and white wine. That’s French. But the sauce is a fenugreek kurma sauce,” he says, adding with a laugh, “Of course, there was a push back from the Indian diners. They said it was not authentic. But I would be there, wearing a kurta-pyjama, and I would speak to them in fluent Hindi, Punjabi or Urdu, and they would agree to give it a chance.”

Finding fame

When Mark Bittman from The New York Times visited anonymously, and wrote a review on Vij’s calling it ‘easily among the finest Indian restaurants in the world,’ diners began to queue up outside.

Today, Vikram and his ex-wife Meeru Dhalwala run Vij’s, and the more casual Rangoli, which features a chic glocal-Indian plates like broccoli, bacon and black chickpea curry, or savoury crepes with grilled kale. He and Meeru still have a strong partnership: “My ex-wife is the mother of my daughters. She is involved in the cooking, and runs the kitchens. I never want to take the credit away: she is an integral part of the restaurants,” he says.

Vikram also has a solo restaurant, My Shanti, with a menu based on his travels across India, featuring Hyderabad-inspired duck biryani, as well as gunpowder prawns and wild boar kebabs.

His most charming legacy, however, is his Punjabi, all-woman workforce. “It started when I needed a dishwasher, and my Punjabi head cook suggested someone from her village,” he says, explaining how it has inadvertently grown into a support-group of sorts for first and second generation immigrants.

“None of them are chefs. All of them have worked so hard to educate their children, sending them to great schools and now the kids have good jobs... The day-time ladies don’t know the menu, they grind dal, prep vegetables and leave. Then the next batch comes and starts putting it together,” says Vikram.

For them, work is not just about creating edgy modern Indian food. It’s cooking the way their grandmothers did back in India: as a community.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/27grn8/article30913535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26MPCHEFVIKRAMVED,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/chef-vikram-vijs-modern-indian-food-boasts-of-canadian-ingredients-and-french-techniques/article30913536.ece

The kimchi arrives right away and keeps the hungry diner occupied till the soup or any of the variety of starters arrive.

A new menu card greets the guest with the specials. It is a good idea to take a hard look at it. Some of the names look unfamiliar, but there is a helpful description by its side to give you a fair notion of what to expect. So, Chả Giò Tươi is Vietnamese spring rolls, that are slender batons of vegetables prettily wrapped in translucent rice paper and served with a peanut sauce. You will probably beg for more of the sauce! The water chestnut and mushroom dimsums are steamed, delicious and reinforced the feeling of ‘eating healthy’. The Gaeng Kiew Wan is the more popular Thai Green Curry that is served simply with undistracting steamed rice that only enhances the flavour-packed gravy and vegetables and starts a party in your mouth. The favourite Mango and Papaya Salad is right on top of the menu. A perfect start to prepare your palate.

The non-vegetarians do have a wider choice, admits Ranjana Singhal of Thats Y Food, (but assures the vegetarians that they will not be disappointed). They have a choice of chicken, lamb, fish, prawns, shrimp...

If you have the space for a dessert, then try the rice pudding that comes with jackfruit, or the rice pudding with coconut cream, palmsugar and a hit of pandan and kaffir.

427,2020/02/25,Love is blind,"After an accident left Mushu without sight, the little kitten managed to find a safe haven with the Raghunath family

At just a month old, little Osho had been through the worst. Abandoned and emaciated, the orange tabby kitten had met with a terrible road accident. As a result, his eye had popped out of its socket. “Plus, he was already born one-eyed with an underdeveloped eyeball,” remembers Kirti Bhardwaj, a member of the Animal Adoption & Care, a collective of animal lovers and rescuers. Too tiny and weak to operate on, the kitten had to sustain the pain of the injury while kind rescuers built up his strength and immunity. After three long weeks of having an eye dangling from its socket, Osho’s was operated on. Completely blind, the kitten’s chances of getting a home were less than bright. That’s how the Raghunath family changed his life forever.

A dog-loving household, they had always had canine companions. But when the matriarch of the Raghunath household, who worked with the The Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, got to know of Osho, the family knew they had to save him. “We have Lulu, Beauty and Yoko,” says Tara, the family’s 27-year-old daughter. “They are all indies and rescues.” But it’s Lulu who stays with Tara and her mother, while the other two enjoy their own floors in the independent house in Santa Cruz. “The building is privately owned by the family,” says Tara adding that all the animals have plenty of space to play around.

When Osho, now rechristened Mushu arrived at the Raghunath’s, it was supposed to be a trial run to see if the animals would get along. Thankfully, the kitten immediately fit right in. “Both his eyes are surgically removed but that doesn’t phase him at all,” says Tara who initially thought a blind animal would be jittery or

nervous in new situations. “But he wasn’t bothered. He slept the entire time while Lulu was scared of him.”

Mushu, who’s named after the dragon from the Disney film Mulan, couldn’t care less about firecrackers or loud sounds. In fact, he learned how to get around the house pretty early on. He even jumps on

tables and beds confidently. He had a horrible start at life, but now Mushu couldn’t have asked for a better home than the Raghunaths.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/soruo5/article30914154.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mushu-with-LuluRGB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/love-is-blind/article30914155.ece
428,2020/02/25,Pandemonium in Maharashtra Assembly over farm loan waiver issue,"Fadnavis criticised the farm loan waiver announced by the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, saying in two months only 15,000 farmers were its beneficiaries

The Maharashtra Assembly witnessed pandemonium on Tuesday after the opposition BJP accused the state government of “not fulfilling” the assurances made to farmers, and demanded a blanket loan waiver for all cultivators.

As soon as the House assembled for the day, Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said he had given an adjournment notice for a discussion on farmers’ issues and rising crimes against women in the state. “Rest of the business on the day’s agenda should be set aside and these issues should be taken up for discussion,” he demanded.

Fadnavis criticised the farm loan waiver announced by the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, saying in two months only 15,000 farmers were its beneficiaries. “If this is the speed of implementation, it would take 470 months to clear the debt of 35 lakh farmers,” he said.

The present loan waiver is for farmers (whose crop loan is up to ₹2 lakh) till September 2019, the former chief minister said. “The unseasonal rains began in October 2019 and the farmers who suffered crop losses (in those rains) will not benefit,” he said.

Also read: Maharashtra dips into contingency fund for farm loan waiver

The ruling parties, before coming to power, demanded ₹25,000 per hectare for crop losses and current Finance Minister Ajit Pawar even assured ₹1 lakh per hectare, Fadnavis said. “Why are farmers not getting a single penny now?” the senior BJP leader asked.

He demanded that the government announce ₹25,000 per hectare for farmers who suffered crop losses due to unseasonal rains, and a blanket loan waiver for all farmers.

Speaker Nana Patole said the farmers’ issue is important and the day’s business is also important.

The issue of crimes against women is listed in the Calling Attention notice in the day’s business and a special discussion on women is scheduled on March 5, he said. “The issue of crimes against women can be taken up during that time,” Patole said.

However, the BJP members then entered the well of the House and shouted slogans against the government.

Some women members of the BJP wore black aprons,which had slogans against the Uddhav Thackeray government.

The Speaker tried to continue with the Question Hour, while the BJP members shouted slogans against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the government, and tore papers. The women members climbed the podium and gathered near the Speaker’s seat. Patole then asked the opposition members to go back to their seats. “I will allow you to speak, but you should also cooperate,” he said.

State Sports Minister Sunil Kedar said he sat on a fast after the incident of a woman lecturer being burnt by a stalker in Hinganghat town of Wardha district recently, but no BJP worker or leader joined him. “It is easy to just shout slogans,” he said.

Sensing the belligerent mood of the opposition member, the Speaker adjourned the House for 15 minutes. Later, when the House resumed, the presiding officer adjourned it again for another 15 minutes.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/485suu/article30911401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/maha-assembly-protest,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pandemonium-in-maharashtra-assembly-over-farm-loan-waiver-issue/article30911402.ece

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday dismissed the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) claims of a “rift” among the coalition partners of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government,

Mr. Thackeray told a meeting of legislators of the MVA that there has been “good coordination and cooperation” among the allies in the last three months. “I had a good meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi during my recent Delhi visit. We discussed all issues for nearly an hour,” a Minister quoted Mr. Thackeray. The Chief Minister also told the legislators that he is in regular touch with Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar and the Congress leadership.

He also said the implementation of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule farm loan waiver scheme has begun and debt of all beneficiary farmers, whose loan is up to ₹2 lakh, will be cleared by March 31.

430,2020/02/25,Chhota Rajan planned to kill Dawood in 1998: Lakdawala,"Gangster says aides of Chhota Shakeel attacked him after unsuccessful bid

Gangster Ejaz Lakdawala (50) has told the Mumbai Police that close aides of Chhota Rajan had planned to kill fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in 1998, but the operation failed.

Mr. Lakdawala, who was on the run for two decades and was once a close aide of Dawood Ibrahim, made this revelation during interrogation by the Mumbai Crime Branch following his arrest last month in connection with cases of extortion and attempt to murder registered against him. He told the police that aides of Chhota Shakeel attacked him and gangster Chhota Rajan after their unsuccessful bid to kill Dawood Ibrahim.

A source in the Crime Branch said some close aides of Chhota Rajan along with Indian agencies planned to eliminate Dawood Ibrahim in Karachi in 1998. A team, comprising Vicky Malhotra, Farid Tanasha, Balu Dokre, Mr. Lakdawala, Vinod Matkar, Sanjay Ghate and Baba Reddy, went to Karachi in 1998 to kill him, but the operation failed.

Dawood Ibrahim was supposed to come to a dargah after his daughter Maria’s death in Karachi. “Malhotra and the others were waiting for him, but they had to abort the operation as Dawood Ibrahim came to the dargah with huge security after getting a tip-off about it by a Nepal parliamentarian,” the source said. When the team reached the flat where they were staying, Chhota Rajan asked them to leave, saying the operation was leaked to Dawood Ibrahim.

Mr. Lakdawala also told the police that the Pakistan Police probably raided their flat in the next two days and seized all the weapons they had got to eliminate Dawood Ibrahim. Later, Mr. Malhotra killed the Nepal parliamentarian, while Chhota Rajan was attacked in 2000 by Munna Jhingada alias Sayyed Muddassar Hussain, a close aide of Dawood Ibrahim. Mr. Lakdawala was attacked in Bangkok’s busy Bobae Market area in 2002.

He claimed that a tabeez (amulet) saved him from the six bullets fired by Chhota Shakeel’s aides on his chest, hands and neck from point-blank range. Mr. Lakdawala told the police that his aide Salim Maharaj, who was also arrested last month, was the one who had come to Bangkok to give the amulet to him. The source said, “However, Lakdawala was suspicious and did not want to go to meet Maharaj. Instead, he sent his wife to collect the amulet and asked her not to come home directly after meeting Maharaj. But, she defied his order.” After two days, Mr. Lakdawala was attacked. “He told the police that the amulet, which was kept in his pocket during the time of attack, saved his life,” the source said.

Also, as he was shot near a hospital, he got medical help and later fled to Canada. Chhota Shakeel subsequently informed newspapers and TV channels that Mr. Lakdawala was dead. However, some people later confirmed to Chhota Shakeel that Mr. Lakdawala survived the attack, which the former could not believe, the source said.

Back in the reckoning

For a few days, people believed Mr. Lakdawala was dead, the source said. When his criminal activities started again, the underworld came to know that he was alive. But after the attack on him, Mr. Lakdawala became very religious, the source said.

Mr. Lakdawala also told the police he is not sure whether Mr. Maharaj was behind the attack on him. But, as he had no other men left to work for him, he had to work with Mr. Maharaj and carry out his racket.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/chhota-rajan-planned-to-kill-dawood-in-1998-lakdawala/article30910106.ece
431,2020/02/25,Crime Branch records Palande’s statement on letter about Bharti,"Evidence, names of people who can back up claims sought

The Mumbai Police Crime Branch on Monday recorded a statement from multiple murder accused Vijay Palande in connection with his allegations against Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) chief Deven Bharti.

Mr. Palande, currently lodged at Taloja central jail in Navi Mumbai, had in December 2018 written to the Central Vigilance Commission making a host of serious allegations against Mr. Bharti, ranging from corruption to underworld links. The letter was forwarded to the Maharashtra government and an inquiry was set up into the matter.

Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Santosh Rastogi told The Hindu, “Since Mr. Palande is in judicial custody, we had sought permission from the sessions court to officially record his statement. We were given permission to do so on Monday, and accordingly brought him to the Crime Branch headquarters.”

A special team of officers was dispatched to ferry Mr. Palande from the prison to the headquarters late in the evening. Sources said select officers from multiple units have been hand-picked to work on the case.

According to sources, the statement will go into details of the allegations made by Mr. Palande and seek any evidence he can provide to back up his claims, including people who can corroborate his statement. Inquiries will also be made as to why he only wrote the letter in 2018, despite being arrested in 2012 for several murders, including that of Oshiwara resident Arun Tikku, mentioned in the letter.

Mr. Palande has claimed that Tikku was actually killed by his son Anuj, who enlisted the services of gangster Santosh Shetty for the job, and that he was falsely implicated in the case after Anuj paid ₹2 crore to Mr. Bharti.

Mr. Bharti, when contacted on February 18, had denied Mr. Palande's claims, saying that a “motivated, malicious and wild complaint made in 2018 is being peddled in 2020” to further a “nefarious agenda.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/crime-branch-records-palandes-statement-on-letter-about-bharti/article30908274.ece
432,2020/02/25,Brace for traffic snarls on EEH,"Sion flyover to be shut for repairs from Tuesday to March 2

Motorists travelling in the eastern suburbs should brace for another weekend of traffic jams on the Eastern Express Highway (EEH) as the crucial Sion flyover is expected to be shut from Thursday to next Tuesday. The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) began repairs earlier this month.

The second phase is scheduled to start at 6 p.m. on Thursday and traffic will be allowed to resume at 7 a.m. on March 2. The MSRDC overshot the scheduled time during the first phase, which started at 5 a.m. on February 14. It was expected to end on February 17, but the flyover was shut for another day due to technical issues, leading to huge traffic snarls.

The repair process has been divided into eight phases, in which the flyover will be shut for four days each, during which they plan to replace its bearings and expansion joints.

The move came after a study conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, in 2017, stated that they were badly damaged and needed to be replaced.

MSRDC officials said the entire process is expected to be over by mid-April, with a four-day block planned every week. “After we have completed replacing the bearings, we will shut the bridge for at least two weeks to resurface it with concrete,” an official said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a2o2nn/article30908270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMSION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/brace-for-traffic-snarls-on-eeh/article30908271.ece
433,2020/02/25,"Key gangsters nabbed, agencies monitor who tries to fill void","Law enforcement agencies hope to mop up last few remnants of Mumbai’s underworld

With three crucial gangsters now behind bars, law enforcement agencies have stepped up vigilance on activities of the few still on the run, like Guru Satam and Suresh Pujari. Officers said the purpose behind this is two-fold: to check if any of them are trying to move in on the void left behind by the arrested trio, and to apprehend them at the earliest so as to finish the last few remnants of the now scattered Mumbai underworld.

Ravi Pujari, wanted in over 200 cases across several States, was finally brought to New Delhi from Senegal on Sunday. Before him, Ejaz Lakdawala was arrested from Patna in January, while Rajendra Nikhalje alias Chhota Rajan was extradited to India in late 2015.

Police officers said every time a spot gets vacated in the underworld hierarchy, there is an attempt to fill it by other players.

“This was first observed in 2000, when there was a near fatal attack on Chhota Rajan in Thailand. Several of his close aides, Mr. Pujari and Mr. Lakdawala included, broke off to form their own gangs thinking the attack had put him out of action, although this decision was also due to Rajan’s rising paranoia. This was observed again after his arrest. Not just Mr. Lakdawala and Mr. Pujari, others like Mr. Satam and Suresh Pujari, too, increased their activities to gain a better foothold over Mumbai,” a Crime Branch officer said.

Another officer said Mr. Lakdawala and Mr. Pujari’s arrests were significant because there are only a few others left. While earlier, gangsters like Kumar Pillai and Santosh Shetty were active and had resources, now very few remain, with Mr. Pillai being extradited from Singapore in 2016 and Mr. Shetty from Bangkok in 2011.

All of these figures, while rivals, also presented some competition to Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar. Interestingly, all of them worked for Kaskar at the start of their criminal careers, and are now sworn enemies of the gangster after deserting him.

“The strongest player right now is Satam, while others like Suresh Pujari and Prasad Pujari keep trying to maintain their hold over Thane and central Mumbai, respectively. However, manpower is a huge problem as the aura attached to being an underworld figure, which prevailed in the 1980s, no longer exists and guns for hire cannot be expected to be loyal. Our main concern is of all the remaining players coming together to form an alliance,” the officer said.

Agencies in the city and at the Centre are in constant touch, exchanging information obtained from ground-level informants. The movements of all known footsoldiers are being checked upon and fresh tip-offs on the whereabouts of the gangsters are being sought.

Last heard, all three gangsters were believed to be based in various parts of southeast Asia.

The officer said, “The vigilance is not just to keep a check on them, but to also get a fix on their current locations. If we manage to do so, we can straight away start the process of apprehending them with the cooperation of the governments concerned.That is a long process, and the faster we act, the better.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/key-gangsters-nabbed-agencies-monitor-who-tries-to-fill-void/article30908262.ece
434,2020/02/25,IntrCity raises over ₹100 cr. to launch more luxury buses,"The company aims to have a 2,000-bus fleet by 2022

IntrCity by RailYatri on Monday raised over ₹100 crore in the latest round of funding, a majority of which it intends to invest in IntrCity SmartBus. The company launched its intercity bus service last year and entered Mumbai with a service to Ahmedabad in October. It has since started plying on routes from Mumbai to Hyderabad, Goa and Pune.

Speaking with The Hindu, Manish Rathi, CEO and co-founder, IntrCity, said plans were under way to increase the number of buses on all existing routes in the future.

“There will be a lot of focus given to existing routes, where there is high demand. We started with one bus between Delhi and Lucknow, where we now have 10 buses. We will be replicating the same at other hubs such as Mumbai,” he said.

Mr. Rathi said the company plans to ramp up the fleet to 300 buses by the end of the year and also aims to create new hubs in cities like Ahmedabad and Pune to expand to other territories

The service currently has 84 buses across 18 hubs, covering 65 destinations and serving around four lakh travellers per month, a company statement said. The bus service was started on the back of data gathered and analysed by their portal RailYatri, which was launched in 2014.

Mr. Rathi said they aim to expand their fleet to 2,000 buses and around 40 cities by 2022. “Our data tells us that there is a demand surplus of around 20,000 buses on routes touching these 40 cities. We aim to capture around 10% of the market.”

The service offers luxury sleeper buses that run overnight between two cities. The buses are provided by third party operators but designed to specifications outlined by IntrCity and have facilities such as on-board washrooms, WiFi, automatic passenger information system and on-board infotainment. Mr. Rathi said over the last year the company has worked on an AI-enabled driver alert system to ensure driver safety and has expanded lounges across cities.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/wle2a6/article30908253.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25bm-IntrCity-by-RailYatri,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/intrcity-raises-over-100-cr-to-launch-more-luxury-buses/article30908254.ece
435,2020/02/25,Mumbai to get more flights to CIS countries,"Airlines to fly 18 times a week in summer 2020

The GVK-led Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) on Monday announced the introduction of new routes between Mumbai and destinations in Russia and Kazakhstan, also known as Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).

The flights operated by airlines like Aeroflot, Air Astana and Ural Air from CSMIA will not only provide tourists with the opportunity to explore Russia and Kazakhstan, but also help in boosting trade relations between India and the CIS.

The introduction of new flights to the CIS region will see an increase in flights to 18 times a week from three a week in summer 2020.

CIS countries offer a wide range of experiences for tourists. Currently, CSMIA connects to the CIS state of Uzbekistan through Tashkent, the capital and largest city in the country with three flights per week. With a diverse cultural heritage, Tashkent offers an array of art across its architecture and infrastructure and insights into its rich history with monumental structures like the Registan, the ancient city of Khujand and Samarkand as well as the bazars for tourists.

Who flies where

A Mumbai International Airport Ltd. (MIAL) spokesperson said, “Aeroflot (starting July 1) and Ural Air (starting March 31) will fly to Moscow. Air Astana will fly to Almaty in Kazakhstan from June 1. Uzbekistan Airways is also operating three times a week: Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday to Tashkent.”

Ural Air to Moscow will operate on Monday, Tuesday, Friday and Sunday. Aeroflot will operate daily. Air Astana too will operate four times a week.

In a statement, MIAL said India shares a unique and special trade relation with the CIS countries since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Citing a report by Statista, MIAL said over the years, India has seen a steady growth in exports to the region from approximately $2.4 m in FY16 to $3.5 million in FY19, with sectors like food and agribusiness, pharmaceuticals and healthcare, telecommunications, textiles and energy having high potential for trade opportunities.

“With the growing trend of travel to lesser-known destinations, CSMIA has also observed a growth in passenger traffic to the CIS countries,” a spokesperson said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-to-get-more-flights-to-cis-countries/article30908229.ece

437,2020/02/25,Athawale reviews work on Ambedkar memorial,"Project expected to be completed in two years, says Union Minister

Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale on Monday reviewed the proposed site for the memorial of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and discussed the progress of the project with officials of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA).

Mr. Athawale said the project is expected to be completed within two to two-and-a-half years. “The sculpture of Dr. Ambedkar was initially supposed to be 350 feet tall, but the height was later changed to 450 feet. The MMRDA has been working on this project. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was present at the bhoomi poojan ceremony of the site, should also be invited for its inauguration, irrespective of the ruling party in the State,” Mr. Athawale said.

Sonia Sethi, additional metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, discussed the progress of the project with Mr. Athawale. “The Cabinet granted approval for increasing the height of the sculpture on January 15. The estimated cost subsequently rose to ₹1,089 crore from ₹763 crore. The permissions obtained earlier from the Environment Department and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation will have to be obtained again for the revised structure,” she said.

Ms. Sethi said the permissions will be sought when the the new government’s first meeting with the BMC is held on February 28.

“In this meeting, administrative permissions will be obtained and the other permissions will be sought in the next two weeks. Construction will begin from March. The progress of the other four buildings is at 30%,” she said.

The memorial will include four halls, each with the capacity to hold 100 people, a meditation centre, a gallery, a research centre, a preserved natural lake and a larger assembly hall called the Chaitya Sabhagriha under the sculpture. The Chaitya Sabhagriha will have belongings of Dr. Ambedkar and information about his life on display through audio-visual mediums and can hold up to 1,800 people.

Mr. Athawale expressed concern about the sculpture being developed in China, in the light of the coronavirus crisis in the country. He suggested developing the sculpture in India, as it will create employment opportunities. MMRDA officials, however, clarified that the required infrastructure and machinery, as well as bronze needed for the sculpture, is only available in abundance in China.

Mr. Athawale suggested adding an entrance with a 15-foot statue of Gautam Buddha to the meditation centre along with a Bodhi tree from Bodh Gaya being planted near it, besides a well-paved road leading from Chaityabhoomi to the memorial.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/7m6fgk/article30908199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25bmAthawale,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/athawale-reviews-work-on-ambedkar-memorial/article30908200.ece

439,2020/02/25,Prominent heart transplant team quits Fortis,"Team that did city’s first transplant joins Sir H.N. Reliance Foundation hospital; competition in field grows

The team of doctors that conducted Mumbai’s first successful heart transplant and went on to do nearly 108 transplants at Mulund’s Fortis Hospital has moved to South Mumbai’s Sir H.N. Reliance Foundation Hospital. While poaching of prominent doctors is not new for hospitals in the country, Mumbai’s heart transplant field is set to get more competitive with hospitals lining up to conduct the life-saving procedure.

Cardiac transplant surgeon Dr. Anvay Mulay who conducted the first successful heart transplant in 2015, joined Sir H.N. Reliance Foundation Hospital last month along with other doctors, including physician assistants, associate consultants and anaesthetists. The team has already carried out its first heart transplant at the South Mumbai hospital, but the recipient died a few days later.

Another South Mumbai centre, Jaslok Hospital on Peddar Road, conducted its first heart transplant on February 8 with surgeon Dr. Hemant Pathare at the helm. The patient, a 51-year-old man, is recovering and is likely to be discharged this week. The latest entrant in the field is Byculla’s Masina Hospital that received a heart transplant licence two weeks ago. With this, Mumbai now has eight centres: Fortis, Global, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani, Jupiter, Nanavati, Jaslok, Sir H.N. Reliance Foundation and Masina, which have licences to conduct heart transplants.

“There is a huge price tag for heart transplants. When more hospitals start doing the procedure, the price automatically comes down,” said cardiac surgeon Dr. Z. Hamdulay, chairman and director of the heart institute at Masina Hospital, which has at least 10 patients from its heart failure clinic as candidates for transplants. Dr. Hamdulay, who is also a transplant consultant at Global Hospital, said heart transplants are not very sophisticated or complex procedures but they need good, state-of-the-art infrastructure.

“When liver transplants were started, their cost went up to ₹40 lakh to ₹45 lakh. But as competition increased, the cost came down to ₹19 lakh,” he said. The cost of a heart transplant goes up to ₹30 lakh. Masina Hospital has priced the procedure at ₹15 lakh, perhaps the lowest in the city.

Chennai-based cardiac anaesthesiologist and critical care specialist Dr. Suresh Rao said sustaining heart transplant programmes is not viable for most hospitals due to the cost of infrastructure. “A few years down the line, only some hospitals will continue with the programme,” said Dr. Rao who is a part of Dr. K.R. Balakrishnan’s heart transplant team that quit Fortis Malar Hospital last year to join MGM Healthcare in Chennai. Since 2010, the team has conducted nearly 350 heart transplants.

The Sir H.N. Reliance Foundation Hospital is positive about sustaining the programme with “world-class infrastructure and cutting-edge technology”. “Dr Mulay, who joined us as director of the Centre for Advanced Cardiac Surgery and Heart Transplant comes with more than 35 years of experience and has done the highest number of heart transplants in western India,” said the hospital’s CEO Dr. Tarang Gianchandani.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/7l6ovp/article30908176.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMRELIANCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/prominent-heart-transplant-team-quits-fortis/article30908177.ece

A 77-year-old man from Trombay was mowed down by a tempo on Sion-Panvel Highway in Vashi on Monday morning.

Madhukar Sitaram Koli, a retired BARC employee, was crossing the road from Wockhardt hospital to Vashi gaon when he was hit by a milk tempo going towards Mumbai. He sustained a head injury and fractured his right leg and hand.

“At the time of the accident, a policeman from Mumbai was passing by and he informed the control room. Koli was rushed to the NMMC Hospital but he was declared dead on arrival. We contacted his sons and they claimed the body,” sub-inspector Sopan Rakhonde, Vashi police station, said.

The police has got the registration number of the tempo and are trying to trace the accused. “Koli’s sons said he was undergoing treatment with Fortis Hospital and had probably come for some check-up,” Mr. Rakhonde said.

Last year in May, another pedestrian was killed on the highway, after which 300 Vashi gaon residents staged a rasta roko under the leadership of former corporator Dashrath Bhagat.

“There is a subway to cross the road which is in poor condition and cannot be used. The signal has not been working there ever since road work started. We have been demanding two service roads along the highway for 10 years but our demands have fallen on deaf ears,” Mr. Bhagat said.

He said the highway has service roads from Sanpada to Kharghar, which are necessary in order to bring down accident rates. “We have also been requesting for a foot overbridge,” Mr. Bhagat said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/77-year-old-mowed-down-on-sion-panvel-highway/article30908168.ece

The police on Monday detained eight protesters at Marine Drive and stopped a vigil called at Gateway Of India to protest the violence against anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters in Delhi on Monday.

A small group of protesters had gathered at Marine Drive around 11.30 p.m. for a candlelight vigil.

“Eight people have been taken to the police station. They will be released after half an hour,” said DCP (Zone I) Sangram Singh Nishandar. The protesters were taken to Azad Maidan police station.

A human rights activist and lawyer who was protesting also alleged that she was manhandled by the police.

Earlier in the evening, a message calling people to gather at Gateway of India from 10 p.m. to midnight started doing the rounds on social media. The police, as soon as they learned about it, made it clear that the gathering did not have permission and would not be allowed.

“No gathering of any kind will be allowed at any location in the city except the designated space for protests, which is Azad Maidan. All those who indulge in any unlawful gathering shall be arrested and offences registered against them,” Mumbai Police spokesperson DCP Pranaya Ashok said.

442,2020/02/25,"CA, two others held for attempt to murder, dowry harassment","He attacked wife’s brother with knife following argument

A chartered accountant attached to the State Bank of India (SBI) has been arrested, along with his father and brother, for allegedly attempting to murder his brother-in-law over a demand for dowry.

Jayprakash Prasad (35), a resident of Sanjog CHS at Sector 9 in Vashi, was arrested on February 19. He married Nivedita, a senior assistant at SBI, in 2015 after meeting through a matrimonial site. According to the police, the family had since then been harassing Nivedita for dowry. The couple has two sons aged three-and-a-half and two.

On February 15, Ms. Nivedita’s brother Sunilkumar Gupta, a garment businessman in Uttar Pradesh, visited the Prasad family to resolve the differences. Mr. Prasad demanded a car, and to avoid further arguments, Mr. Gupta walked out of the flat. But Mr. Prasad followed him out and attacked him with a knife, the police said.

“While he attacked Mr. Gupta, his father, mother and brother kept encouraging him to hit him even more,” assistant police inspector Deepak Shikhare from Vashi police station said. Following the assault, Ms. Nivedita rushed her brother to hospital, while her husband and in-laws fled.

On ventilator support

The police recorded Mr. Gupta’s statement at Apollo Hospital. “He was conscious only while giving his statement, but has since been unconscious and on ventilator support,” Mr. Shikhare said.

A case of attempt to murder was registered on February 16 against Mr. Prasad, his father Dinanath (58), mother Lakhpatodevi (55), and brother Nitesh Kumar (22). During investigations, Mr. Shikhare learnt that the family had fled to Jharkhand. The police reached there on February 19 and arrested Mr. Prasad, his father and brother. They returned to Navi Mumbai on February 21.

443,2020/02/25,Man wanted for stealing laptops held,"A man who stole laptops from vehicles parked outside offices has been arrested by the Vashi police.

Ravindra Kumar Santlal Gaund (37) was arrested last week after sub-inspector Kashinath Mane received a tip-off. “The accused used to work as a sales executive in Tata Docomo’s shop at Vashi Sector 17 and knew the parking areas of the executives.

444,2020/02/25,HC extends relief to TISS student by three weeks,"Prosecutor seeks time from court as forensic lab reports are awaited

The Bombay High Court on Monday extended the interim protection from arrest for the 22-year-old Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) charged with sedition for another three weeks.

The student, Urvashi Chudawala, had allegedly raised slogans in support of Sharjeel Imam, a student of Jawaharlal Nehru University, arrested on the charges of sedition.

Ms, Chudawala has been charged under Sections 124A (sedition — whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the government established by law in India), 153 B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 505 (statements conducing public mischief), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

A single Bench of Justice S.K. Shinde was hearing a plea filed by Ms. Chudawala seeking extension of the pre-arrest bail that she was granted after the sessions court rejected it.

The prosecutor sought time from the court awaiting forensic science laboratory reports, and the matter will now be heard on March 16.

On February 11, the same court had granted anticipatory bail to the student

The court had questioned the applicability of sedition charges, asking if sloganeering satisfied the twin requirement of intention and tendency to disorder or disturb peace by resorting to violence as mentioned in Section 124 A of the IPC. It had said that “a citizen had the right to comment on the government as long as he does not incite violence or creates disorder.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-extends-relief-to-tiss-student-by-three-weeks/article30908134.ece
445,2020/02/25,MMRDA to begin work on Bhayander-Vasai bridge,"It may be completed by 2024; environment clearances soon

The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) will soon commence the construction of the long-pending creek bridge connecting Bhayander (West) and Vasai (West). The 4.98-km bridge is expected to cost ₹1,501.16 crore and is likely to be completed by September 2024.

Consultant appointed

Senior MMRDA officials said tenders for the project will soon be floated, and that they were aiming to award the contracts in the next few months. MMRDA has appointed M/s. Stup Consultants to prepare a detailed report.

The project had been stuck for several years owing to environmental clearances and the fact that a portion of the bridge passed through salt pan lands. Senior officials said they were in the final stages of getting the environmental clearances and had received an in-principle approval from the Centre to construct a portion of the flyover on salt pan land. “We should be ready with all the requisite permissions in a few months’ time,” a senior MMRDA official, said.

Once completed, the six-lane bridge, three for each direction, is expected to cut the travel time to Vasai and Virar by at least 45 minutes. At present, the road access between Vasai-Virar and Mumbai is only through the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway. The highway lies around 10 kilometres to the east of the towns and sees heavy congestion during peak hours as it is the arterial link between Mumbai and Gujarat.

Parallel to railway bridge

The new bridge will be built almost parallel to the existing railway bridge and will provide direct access for motorists to Bhayander and by extension, Mumbai city. MMRDA officials said the new bridge will serve over eight lakh people daily who travel by road to and from that region.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mmrda-to-begin-work-on-bhayander-vasai-bridge/article30908132.ece
446,2020/02/25,Court rejects Nirav Modi’s plea on confiscation of properties,"ED lists properties worth ₹1,396.07 crore to be confiscated

A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Monday rejected the plea of diamantaire Nirav Modi, who is currently lodged in a prison in the United Kingdom, seeking that he should be heard before passing any order on confiscation of his properties. The court is scheduled to begin hearing on the confiscation of Mr. Modi’s properties on February 29.

Mr. Modi was declared a fugitive economic offender on December 5. The court had enabled the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to confiscate his properties in India, United Kingdom, and United Arab Emirates.

But the Punjab National Bank had approached the court urging it to not allow confiscation but to release the properties to the bank to clear the dues Mr. Modi owed it. On the basis of the bank’s plea, Mr. Modi had filed an application asking for a copy of the bank’s plea and that he be heard before passing any order.

The court, however, said Mr. Modi had no right to claim the copy as he had been declared a fugitive, and he would not be heard before passing an order. The court said it would only hear parties who had an interest in the properties that Mr. Modi owned and was listed by the ED for confiscation.

The court further said the process of confiscation of properties would begin on February 29, and all parties who were interested should file their pleas before it. The court has also issued notices to Mr. Modi’s family members and companies on whose names the properties are listed.

The ED till now has listed properties worth ₹1,396.07 crore to be confiscated which the agency claimed was purchased or owned from the proceeds of crimes by Mr. Modi. While declaring him a fugitive, the court had said that Mr. Modi had left the country under suspicious circumstances to dodge the penal consequences of the acts he had done while in India till 2018.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/w33mcu/article30908123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMNIRAVMODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/court-rejects-nirav-modis-plea-on-confiscation-of-properties/article30908124.ece
447,2020/02/25,"Companies, chefs on health food trip","Marico to expand Eat Right programme; Australian chef speaks to students about better eating choices

Promotion of healthy food habits among people, especially children and the youth, seems to have emerged as a new focus area for corporates, educators, food experts, educational institutions, regulatory authorities and even startups.

Marico Limited, which has been partnering Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and Food and Drugs Control Administration (FDA), Gujarat, to promote healthy food, has decided to expand the Eat Right programme to foster hygienic food habits.

Marico, with the support of local units of the FDA and FSSAI, is working with three Eat Right Campuses, five Clean Street Food Hubs and 50 schools in Gujarat wherein it has introduced the Safe and Nutritious Food at School (SNF@School) initiative. It aims to work with 100 schools, 10 Eat Right campuses and 11 Street Food Hubs and reach over 4,00,000 people across Gujarat, Chandigarh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu this year.

In the past one year alone, the company reached out to 200 schools, benefiting more than 80,000 children across India.

As a part of its Eat Right Campus programme, the company is into awareness building on healthy eating across campuses such as IIM Ahmedabad, NIRMA University in Gujarat, among others. To revive the street food culture across the country and provide safe and hygienic local eating experiences for domestic and international tourists, FSSAI introduced the Project Clean Street Food initiative and Marico is supporting this.

“Food safety is a shared responsibility,” said Pawan Kumar Agarwal, CEO, FSSAI.

“Having made a positive impact in the past three years, we are now expanding our initiatives in Gujarat through Eat Right Campuses, Clean Street Food Hubs and Safe and Nutritious Food at School programmes, with an aim to promote healthy, safe and hygienic food habits,” said Dr. Sudhakar Mhaskar, CTO, Research and Development, Marico.

Meanwhile Australian cooking icon and MasterChef guest judge Stephanie Alexander A.O. is visiting India to talk to young students about the importance of healthy eating choices.

A graduate of the Faculty of Arts at the University of Melbourne, she is part of a delegation from the University of Melbourne.

As the founder of Stephanie’s Restaurant, which operated in Melbourne for 21 years, and the author of 18 cookbooks, she said she is passionate about education. Through her Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Foundation, a charity, she promotes healthy eating choices for children through fun and hands-on learning.

It is this passion for both food and education which brings her to India for events run by the University of Melbourne to speak with prospective graduate students in Marketing, Journalism, Media and Communications about the importance of food culture.

The events, titled ‘Food Journeys’, will also feature leading academics from the University of Melbourne’s Faculty of Arts.

“I am very pleased to have this opportunity and hope I will be able to encourage young Indians to take the plunge into a new culture, and enjoy the enrichment that follows such a venture,” Ms. Alexander said.

On the other hand, Bengaluru-based startup ‘Bhookha Haathi’, founded by Abhimanyu Rishi and Kusum Bhandari, is a building an alternative foods and health-based nutraceutical tech brand that can help consumers live a healthy lifestyle by offering them products that can support their well being.

The company offers healthier diets by supplying people nutritious, wholesome and tasty choices as an alternative to the nutrient-deficient ingredients in their daily diet.

448,2020/02/25,HC raps PWD officials for ‘falsifying’ court record,"Officials’ statements may amount to perjury, says court

The Bombay High Court (HC) has come down heavily on senior officials of the State Public Works Department (PWD) for creating a false record of the court. Prima facie, the HC said, “it appears that these respondents are guilty of deposing to such false averments or statements, which may amount to perjury.”

The officials are Manoj Saunik, Additional Chief Secretary; C.P. Joshi, Secretary and Ajit Sagne, Secretary (Works). While the counsels representing the three have tendered an unconditional apology to the court, Justice G.S. Kulkarni in his order on Monday said, “Let such affidavits by these respondents/deponents be placed on record by tomorrow (Tuesday).”

The matter pertains to a contempt petition filed by one Manaj Tollway Private Limited against the PWD. The affidavits filed by the three officials mentioned an identical paragraph regarding a court order dated November 25, 2019, which the court has observed to be false.

The order states that the objectionable paragraph 5 of the affidavit of Mr. Manoj (Respondent No. 3), Additional Chief Secretary, Public Works Department, is required to be noted which reads: “At the hearing held on 25th November 2019, the Hon’ble Bombay High Court directed that the consent terms be filed in this Hon’ble Court by 2nd December, 2019. It was observed that it was in public interest to settle the aforesaid claim at ₹358.79 crore, which translated to a saving to the public exchequer of ₹22,80,918. The future interest could be limited to interest at RBI rates on the unpaid amount. The same was communicated to the petitioner vide letter dated 25th November, 2019.”

The court observed that verbatim averments are made in the affidavit by Ajit Sagne, and C.P. Joshi has incorporated an identical averment in his affidavit.

The court order on that date, however, said, “By consent Stand Over (adjourned) to 02/12/2019.” “All this would clearly indicate that an incorrect record is sought to be created by the deponents of the said affidavits,” the HC observed on Monday. “It is with deep anguish and pain that the averments as made in the respective affidavits are noted by the Court. If these averments of the respective respondents were to go unnoticed, it would have not only amounted to maintaining and permitting a false record to be created, but also amount to putting a premium on the dishonesty of these respondents.”

The court said it would be very difficult to show any laxity to the respondents, but asked them to explain how the averments found their way into their statements.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-raps-pwd-officials-for-falsifying-court-record/article30908090.ece
449,2020/02/25,Protests are most vibrant for society: T.M. Krishna,"T.M. Krishna on the power of the Constitution, hypocrisy in the world of music, and the Dalit community that makes mrdangams

The history, sociology and the techniques of making the mrdangam is the central vein of Carnatic musician Thodur Madabusi Krishna’s new book Sebastian & Sons: A Brief History of Mrdangam Makers.

In an interview with The Hindu, Krishna says that he started working on this book four years ago in a continuation of his first book, A Southern Music. His first book was a discovery: of the details of aesthetic, history and musicology of Carnatic music. The book was also a critique on Carnatic music. While Krishna was writing his first book, he realised that he had forgotten to talk about the instruments. “In some ways my mind is limited. I realised I was failing. And [it is] in this realisation of failure, [that] I thought of understanding the world of mrdangam music and the makers,” says the music virtuoso.

Also read: Kalakshetra foundation revokes permission for T.M. Krishna's book release event

Step-by-step description

The book is an in-depth account of every step of the process involved in the making of the mrdangam. It covers the making of the percussion instrument, right from the slaughterhouse where its ‘skin’ is chosen until the last stage when the instrument is tuned. It also traces the growth of urbanisation as the book tracks different geographical locations and the changes in the instrument’s manufacture, dependent as the makers were on the artistes who used the mrdangam.

Also read: T.M. Krishna did not tell us about the scope of his book: Palghat Mani Iyer’s family

Extensive fieldwork

It took Krishna more than a year just to transcribe his interviews with the mrdangam makers. He travelled around the four southern States of India to meet them. “I did a lot of field trips and was also simultaneously reading about the Dalit community who are the mrdangam makers,” says Krishna. The musician also travelled to places where different elements that make up a mrdangam are sourced. The book is particularly relevant today, as several news reports that document the opposition of cow slaughter come out on a daily basis. Krishna’s book exposes the hypocrisy of those who oppose cow slaughter, yet play or enjoy the percussion instrument.

Krishna is best known for his unorthodox approach to music. “I don’t like using the words traditional or purist. I sing raga music which many people might consider traditional or pure but many might not,” says Krishna emphasising the Carnatic musicians singing in films does not make the art form less traditional. “If [the] art form remains claustrophobic and is only performed by certain communities then the art form will remain limited,” says Krishna.

While Krishna travels across countries for his concerts, he believes that they way audience receive his music is completely different when it comes to every individual. “Look at Mumbai. The way a person from Matunga listens to Carnatic music is completely different from the way a person from Dharavi or in south Mumbai listens to it. Even within one city there is cultural diversity of listening to music,” says Krishna expressing that he finds this the most beautiful part of society.

The Magsaysay award winner has always believed in taking music to masses. His recent trip to Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh protest was an overwhelming experience for Krishna. “To see these wonderful women sitting and celebrating the protest brings the democracy alive. The sheer love for our country is felt at Shaheen Bagh,” says Krishna who hopes that the protest would bring in a transformation in Indian electoral politics. He adds while most people believe that protests are all about screaming and shouting, at Shaheen Bagh one feels that protest is a happy one. “In protests, democracy comes alive. In protests we are alive. In protests we sing, dance, write poetry and dramas. According to me, protests are the most vibrant thing for society,” Krishna says.

Lauding students

Commenting on the recent police action at Delhi universities, Krishna says that the country should be thankful to the students who have put their lives at stake in order to protect the Constitution. “They want to ensure that India remains a secular and socialist republic in letter and spirit,” he emphasises.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/nkesqx/article30908007.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMTMKRISHNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/protests-are-most-vibrant-for-society/article30908008.ece
450,2020/02/25,Premier racing event lives up to expectations again,"Equestrian enthusiasts treated to thrilling finish

The Poonawalla Breeders’ Multi-Million (PBMM) has invariably drawn huge crowds for the last three decades. This year too, the extravaganza lived up to expectations as people thronged the sprawling lawns of Mahalaxmi Racecourse on Sunday.

The Poonawalla family and the Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) ensured that the day was an enjoyable one for everyone.

The Bengaluru-based top filly, Forest Flame, ridden by Irish jockey David Egan stole the limelight. The Suleiman Attaollahi-trained filly completed a hat-trick of victories by beating her rivals in great style.

This was the fourth successive year that the Poonawalla family had bred and owned the winner of the plum event. The last three winners were Missing You (2019), Corfe Castle (2018) and Ruffina (2017).

After the trophy presentation ceremony, Zavaray Poonawalla, chairman of RWITC, said, “We are so thankful to our friends, family and patrons for making the 31st edition of the PBMM bigger and better than ever before. Known historically as one of the most exciting days in the annual racing calendar, this year was extra special for me.”

Mr. Poonawalla said the race gave his family several reasons to cheer. “Not only were the top three placings bred by the Poonawallas, which is a huge source of pride in itself, but my daughter Delna also did a fabulous job in bringing fashion, glitz and glamour to the racecourse for Sunday’s races,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/u596dg/article30907975.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMPBMM-winner-Forest-Flame,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/premier-racing-event-lives-up-to-expectations-again/article30907976.ece
451,2020/02/25,"Gangster, 2 others held in new extortion case","Trio remanded in judicial custody

Gangster Ejaz Lakdawala, his associate Salim Maharaj, and Dawood Ibrahim’s aide Tariq Parveen were arrested in a fresh extortion case on Monday soon after a special Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act court remanded them in judicial custody for allegedly trying to extort ₹2 crore from a dry fruits businessman in south Mumbai.

According to the complainant, soon after Mr. Lakdawala had demanded ₹2 crore from him, he had approached Mr. Parveen to sort out the issue. However, Mr. Parveen and Mr. Maharaj demanded another ₹10 lakh from him. The complainant gave them ₹3 lakh, but realised that the accused would demand more money, so he closed his business and went to his native place in Gujarat.

On Monday, the Anti Extortion Cell of the Mumbai Crime Branch produced the trio before a metropolitan magistrate’s court and sought their custody in a case, where the complainant said he was developing two dilapidated buildings in Pydhonie, and due to Mr. Parveen’s interference, he lost ₹7.5 crore.

The Crime Branch said Mr. Maharaj also used to visit the developer and it suspected that the duo threatened the complainant at the behest of Mr. Lakdawala.

453,2020/02/25,Under-15 Puducherry team makes a mark on futsal map,"Five players make it to the national squad for the Futsal World Cup to be held in Paraguay

After the senior team representing Puducherry won the national title last year, the under-15 team broke into the finals of the Futsal National Championship in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh recently, bringing laurels to the Union Territory. The championship is run by the Futsal Association of India, which is also a member of the World Futsal Association (AMF).

Lost to Tamil Nadu

Though they lost on penalties to Tamil Nadu, the remarkable run through the tournament did not go unnoticed, as five players were selected to the national squad for the Futsal World Cup in Paraguay in July.

All the players belong to the CITY 5 Football Club in the city.

“This is indeed a big deal as only the best players from the under-15 tournament are drafted into the national team,” said Pradeep Tillai, general secretary, Futsal Association of Pondicherry.

The selected players are Arya, goal keeper, Darshan, who at 11 years is the youngest player to get selected for the U-15 national team, Esteban, who was adjudged Most Valuable Player for being the top scorer in the tournament with a record number of 19 goals in six matches, Kishore, captain of the team and Nishkalan.

‘Tense match’

The team was led by coach Gnana Deepan Colas, who was the captain of the seniors team that lifted the title. He recalled that the finals was a tense affair with Tamil Nadu getting a lead in the last leg of the game. With barely minutes left for the hooter, Puducherry equalised and sent the game into a penalty shootout.

Though Tamil Nadu won the match, the Puducherry team won over several fans that day, he said.

“I am incredibly proud of how our players. These boys have been training hard for weeks to get ready for this competition. I couldn't ask for a better group of young men and I cannot wait to see what the future holds for them,” said Mr. Pillai, who founded the futsal club in the city.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/136crw/article30916735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FUTSALCHAMPION1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/under-15-puducherry-team-makes-a-mark-on-futsal-map/article30916737.ece
454,2020/02/25,Agitating students removed from Pondicherry University ahead of Vice-President’s visit,"The students have been protesting since February 6, demanding a revocation of the fee hike and 25% reservation for local students in all subjects

Over 100 students of Pondicherry University who have been agitating in front of the administrative block in the campus demanding a revocation of the fee hike were, on Tuesday, removed by the police ahead of the visit of Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday. Mr. Naidu is scheduled to participate in the 28th convocation of the University and confer degrees on students at the Jawaharlal Nehru auditorium in the campus.

The students have been protesting in front of the administrative block since February 6 demanding a revocation of the fee hike and 25% reservation for local students in all subjects.

Police said they removed the protesters in view of the Vice-President’s visit to the campus. A huge posse of police personnel led by Senior Superintendent of Police (Law and Order) Rahul Alwal initally tried to persuade the students. However, when the students refused to budge they were removed and loaded in buses and taken to Madanjeet Singh Institute of South Asia Regional Cooperation (MISARC). The main gates of the university were closed and media persons who went to cover the protests were denied entry by the security personnel.

The students, however, alleged that they were beaten up and put into buses forcibly. “We were protesting peacefully when police took action,” a Students Council spokesperson, said adding that the fees for all the courses have been increased, some even up to 125 %, which is not affordable for many students.

“The administration is turning the University into a corporate system in which students from marginalised sections are totally getting left out. The administration has resorted to using force to remove the students. We will continue with our fight till our demands are met,” the spokesperson added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/98d2zf/article30912698.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25FEBTH-PONDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/agitating-students-removed-from-pondicherry-university-ahead-of-vice-presidents-visit/article30912700.ece
455,2020/02/25,Yoga guru Tao Porchon Lynch’s Puducherry connect,"Tao Porchon-Lynch, born in the U.T., died on February 21 aged 101 years

Yoga guru Tao Porchon-Lynch, who died in White Plains, New York, at the age of 101 on February 21, had a fondness for Puducherry, for she was born in the city.

Ms. Porchon-Lynch, whose zest for life and indomitable spirit had inspired men and women from across the world, was born in erstwhile Pondicherry in 1918 to a French father and Indian mother.

Certified by the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest living yoga teacher, Ms. Porchon-Lynch spent most of her childhood here. She discovered yoga as an eight-year-old child and since underwent tutelage under yogis such as Sri Aurobindo, BKS Iyengar and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

Raised by her uncle, Vital Porchon, who built rail-lines across Asia, she has walked with many leaders of political movements — Mahatma Gandhi during the Salt March of 1930, and later the 1963 March on Washington with Martin Luther King Jr. During her stint as a Hollywood actress, she hobnobbed with the likes of Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable and Elizabeth Taylor.

In an e-mail exchange with The Hindu late in 2016, Ms. Porchon-Lynch, who was conferred the Padma Shri in 2019, said, “My memory of Puducherry is walking into my home, seeing someone sitting on a cushion on the floor and finding out that it was Mahatma Gandhi.” “I visited Puducherry only once. I took a young German yoga teacher back with me. I would like to visit again.” Alas, that was never to be.

She was once asked whether she could dance. “I said just a little and that I would like to dance the tango before I die. They asked me why I din’t start then. Since then, I have never stopped,” said the yoga guru who went on to master the bolero, tango, mambo, cha-cha, samba and swing dance. She pulled off a mind-blowing dance performance at America’s Got Talent.

“There is nothing you cannot do,” was her motto. And, she lived by it every step of the way.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/7v2zxr/article30907966.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YOGAGURUSCREENGRAB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/yoga-guru-tao-porchon-lynchs-puducherry-connect/article30907968.ece
456,2020/02/25,Folk artistes add colour to Tantrotsav finale,"Event sees Bhagavathy Theyyam, Silambam, Kalaripayattu, Baul, Odissi, Mohinyattam and Chhau performances

Martial arts manoeuvres, percussion rhythms and theyyam rituals extended into the night to provide a colourful finale to the Tantrotsav festival at Kalarigram near Auroville.

In a brightly lit arena, the performers of Bhagavathy Theyyam, an art form popular in North Kerala, decked in a costume made of coconut leaf strands, ornaments and brightly painted head-dress made a dramatic appearance to the roll of the percussion instruments.

During an elaborate performance marked by verse and oracle-speak, the theyyam, believed to be an incarnate of the divine, gave blessings to kalari exponents, artists, and even a tiny tot remarkably unfazed by the surroundings.

The finale, which coincided with Shivaratri, also featured a Silambam performance, a sarod recital by Arnab Bhattacharya and Nilimesh Chakraborty (tabla), a cultural pagaent, Kalaripayattu, Thee Kuttychatthan Theyyam and a concert by fusion band Funkistan.

This year’s events, co-hosted by Yogishananda Peetham and Indica, featured a potpourri of music and dance forms spanning Odissi, Mohinyattam and Chhau, fusion music, Baul, satsang and story-telling sessions.

Among the high points were the Mohiniyattam performance by Keiko Okano from Japan. Having explored classical ballet, photography, music and fine art in Japan and America, Ms. Keiko took interest in Indian traditional arts which she felt was firmly connected to her home country. This exploration finally led her to Mohiniyattam.

Gowwli, a two-piece music band, took the floor on one of the nights with a reinvention of Carnatic and coastal folk music.

A rare presentation was the American tribal dance by Paulina Marin, an actress and dancer from Chile. She has been learning Kalaripayattu under Lakshman Gurukkal at Kalarigram since 2018.

Tantra Natyam by Laurence, a non-choreographed and spontaneous movement art form, a fire dance by Laurence Morlon, Odissi by Lopamudra Jena and Vithya Arasu, Bharatanatyam by Vijayan Gunasekaran, Baul music by Sri Chaya and Adi were some highlights.

Shivagarjana Prathisthan presented Mardani Khel, a martial art form from Maharashtra.

Eleanore Genelle’s Odissi, Jayprabha Menon’s Mohiniyattam and Atanu Das’s Bharatanatyam were the other performances.

457,2020/02/25,Statement opposing Trump’s visit issued,"‘Subservience to U.S. interests harmful’

The All India Peace and Solidarity Organisation (AIPSO) expressed opposition to United States President Donald Trump’s visit to India, calling it an attempt at subjugating the market to American interests.

AIPSO president K. Lakshminarayanan, also an MLA, said in a statement that claims of the two countries sharing a special relationship could not be farther from the truth as India was removed from the Special and Preferential List of countries trading with the U.S., days prior to the visit.

‘Affects farmers’

India’s subservience to U.S. interests could result in deals that remove tariffs and adversely affect livelihoods of farmers, undermine access to healthcare and exacerbate the climate crisis, he said.

The statement, which had several signatories, said that this was not the time for complacency given the rise of right-wing ideology across the world.

“We stand in solidarity with all sections of society in India and across the world who are struggling for justice and dignity in the face of repressive regimes,” he said in the statement.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/statement-opposing-trumps-visit-issued/article30907925.ece

459,2020/02/25,LIC divestment bad for economy: MP,"‘Public-sector banking, insurance firms saved nation from 2008 recession’

N.K. Premachandran, MP, has said that the Centre’s decision to offload its stake in Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) could be devastating for the country’s economy.

He was speaking while inaugurating the two-day All India Biennial General Council of the Federation of LIC Class-I Officers’ Associations here on Monday.

Terming the success story of the State-run insurance behemoth as a model worth emulating for other public-sector undertakings, Mr. Premachandran said that the Centre’s move to sell a part of its holding in the LIC through initial public offering (IPO) lacked logic. “The Centre is hell-bent on destroying a company that has been reaping huge profits with minimal government support since its inception in 1956. The government intended to privatise the company through its decision to sell off 10% of its shares,” he said.

Role in development

He added that the country had managed to insulate itself from the repercussions of the global recession of 2008 due to its robust public-sector banking and insurance sector.

Besides, the company had played a major role in the country’s development by financing numerous projects, including drinking water schemes, infrastructure development, transportation and rural development.

“While the company has been able to withstand competition posed by multi-national companies in the era of globalisation thus far, the Centre’s bid did not auger well for the company and the country as a whole,” Mr. Premachandran said.

He added that while the company had grown to possess assets to the tune of ₹32-lakh crore, though it had received only less than ₹100 crore by way of grants from the Centre since its establishment. The unparalleled achievement was mainly due to its unmatched rural penetration and the efforts made by the company’s development officers and agents over the years.

MLA differs

BJP MLA O. Rajagopal, who delivered the keynote address, struck a discordant note.

Alleging that such controversies were propagated by those with “leftist thinking,” he said that the reforms were aimed at protecting the interests of the country at large, though they could possibly affect a few sections.

He exhorted the delegates to adopt a holistic view and not a sectarian view in such issues.

Federation president Baburao Humraskar presided over the inaugural session. Federation general secretary S. Rajkumar, LIC regional manager R.

460,2020/02/25,Breakwater work at a slow pace,"10,000 tonnes of granite is needed daily for the Vizhinjam project

The construction of the 3.1 km breakwater, the critical component of the Vizhinjam International multi-purpose deepwater seaport, is yet to achieve the desired pace.

Adani Vizhinjam Port Private Ltd (AVPPL) tasked with the execution of the ambitious seaport at Vizhinjam near here by the government had been able to complete only 675 metres of the 3.1 km long breakwater even after the government’s directive to expedite the work on the Public Private Partnership (PPP) project.

Deadline missed

The AVPPL, which had missed the deadline of December 3, 2019 fixed for the completion of the Phase I of the project as per the concession pact, is able to make available only 1,500 to 2,000 tonnes of granite needed for the construction of the breakwater.

The inability of the multi-port operator to source granite locally is cited as the main reason for the slow progress of breakwater work, official sources said.

From Thoothukudi

Sourcing the granite from Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu and moving it through bottom opening barges to the site and option of using sea route to move granite via Muthalapozhi and Kollam harbour has not met with success.

The government was hopeful that opening the sea route to bring granite and sourcing granite locally from the southern districts of the State will expedite the breakwater work that came to a standstill in 2017.

Although the AVPPL had sought permission to source granite from 20 quarries in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Pathanamthitta districts, official sources said they have got the nod only from three quarries till date.

At least 10,000 tonnes of granite has to be dumped daily into the deepwater contours, where the depth varies from 18 to 20 metres, to complete the remaining portion of the breakwater. As depth increases, volume of granite needed for breakwater will also go up.

It is estimated that as much as 70 lakh tonnes of granite, including 10 lakh tonnes for berth and 55 lakh tonnes for the breakwater, is needed to finish the work.

Eight months

“Even if 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes of granite reach the site of breakwater construction daily, the completion will take eight months. Scaling up the procurement of granite and exploiting the sea route with the introduction of more barges can speed up the work,” sources said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/l866yr/article30907516.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TV25VIZHINJASS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/breakwater-work-at-a-slow-pace/article30907508.ece

“We have not gone into the matter in detail. But the bugs may been in search of a new habitat. Nocturnal by nature, they may have been attracted by the stadium lights.

463,2020/02/25,DYFI to step up campaign against CAA,"Youth squads to visit houses

The Democratic Youth Federation of India will step up its ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens, with a month-long campaign across the State.

Announcing the campaign at a press conference here on Monday, State secretary A.A.Rahim said the campaign would expand its focus also to raise concerns on the privatisation of major public sector companies.

The campaign, to be launched on March 1, will have the slogan ‘Don’t sell the country, don’t divide the country’.

Youth assemblies will be organised at the 27,252 units of the DYFI across the State. The youth assemblies will be held from March 1 to 18.

As part of this, youth squads will be formed to carry out house visits from March 24 to 31 to raise awareness on the CAA and the NRC.

With at least two squads in each area, around 50,000 such squads will be formed.

To mark the martyrdom day of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev on March 23, Bhagat Singh squares will be installed at each unit centre.

Assessed impact

“A DYFI State committee meeting held yesterday assessed the impact of the ongoing protests and found that we have been able to create awareness among the youth regarding the negative effects of the CAA and the NRC.

464,2020/02/25,Youth rescued from Saudi Arabia,"Subjected to ill-treatment by sponsor in that country

The Department of Non-resident Keralites Affairs (NoRKA) turned saviour for Vithura native V. Adwait who was duped by his sponsor in the Middle East and subjected to ill-treatment in Saudi Arabia for two months until his rescue.

The youth’s hope for a prosperous future were dashed a few months after he had managed to land himself the job of a driver in Kuwait with the help of a friend.

He had been appointed as the driver of his sponsor. However, Adwait’s joy was short-lived when his sponsor inexplicably transferred him to his farm in Riyadh where the youth was tasked with rearing camels and goats. For nearly two months, Adwait was accommodated in a tent and was denied adequate food and water.

It was during then that Adwait’s father learnt of his son’s plight and submitted a complaint to NoRKA-Roots, the field agency of the department.

Soon, officials of the agency contacted the Indian Embassy in Saudi Arabia to ascertain the well-being of the youth. NoRKA-Roots chief executive officer Harikrishnan Namboothiri K. established contact with Naas Shoukath, a social activist based in Dammam.

Having completed formalities, the NoRKA-Roots provided an air-ticket to pave way for his departure from Saudi Arabia.

466,2020/02/25,Road encroachers under scanner,"300 cases of commercial establishmentss encroaching on public roads detected

The city Corporation has identified more than 300 cases of commercial establishments and hawkers encroaching into footpaths and public roads, causing trouble to pedestrians as well as motorists.

The civic body is not gearing up for action against the encroachments, as part of the town planning standing committee’s series of steps to address parking and traffic issues in the cities.

Count taken

“Officials of the engineering and health wing have been for the past few weeks taking a count of the commercial establishments causing obstructions to pedestrians with additional constructions in front of their shops. We also have a list of all licensed street vendors in the city.

This list has been used to identify those who have been illegally occupying the streets,sources said.

As per the figures received from areas under the main office as well as the zonal offices, we have more than 300 cases of encroachments.

Action to be taken

The action to be taken will be decided after a meeting with the Mayor, said Palayam Rajan, Chairman of the city Corporation’s town planning committee.

The Mayor’s complaint redressal cell, which was opened last month, has been receiving several complaints regarding such encroachments, as well as on the high parking fees charged by some shopping malls and multiplexes.

Shopping malls and major hospitals in the city have been charging money from customers for parking their vehicles on the premises, in violation of the Kerala Municipal Building Rules (KMBR), sources said.

According to the KMBR, permits can be allocated to a commercial establishment only if it has adequate parking space in proportion to the area of the building. Private parking lots, independent of buildings, need to take a license from the local body by paying the licence fee.

Mr.Rajan said that the Deputy Secretary has been asked to prepare a list of those who have taken the license from the Corporation to run parking lots where fee can be collected.

Action will be taken against the rest.

A second notice has been served to the commercial establishments which were found to have converted their designated parking lots for other purposes, after their initial reply was found to be unsatisfactory.

469,2020/02/25,Karur Bypass Road: ‘Work in Progress’,"Tiruchi Corporation finally responds to long-pending demand of residents

Addressing a long-felt need, Tiruchi Corporation has finally begun work on strengthening Karur Bypass Road in the city.

The civic body had earlier announced plans to develop the road as a model project with pedestrian pavements, central median, storm water drains and ducts for cables. The work was sanctioned at an estimated cost of ₹7.75 crore from Infrastructure Gap Filling Fund.

The substantially higher allocation compared to other road development works was made to incorporate the features, according to officials.

Construction of storm water drains along the nearly 100-foot-wide road is under way.

The road will be relaid end to end. Work is also underway on extending the underground drainage and the works will be completed in about four months, according to a senior civic official.

The project comes in the wake of persistent demand from city residents for development of the road, which, in recent years, has emerged as an arterial stretch as it connects Salai Road and Tiruchi-Karur Highway.

Even the District Road Safety Council, at its last meeting, called for widening of the road and construction of road median.

The road is now an important entry route for vehicles coming from northern and western districts of the State.

Mofussil buses and other vehicles from these districts enter the city via this road to go via Anna Nagar Link Road to reach Central Bus Stand.

Besides, it has become a commercial nerve centre as a clutch of retail showrooms, hotels and eateries have come up on the road.

Many establishments do not have dedicated parking space, forcing visitors to park their vehicles on the roadside compounding the problem.

Residents have been demanding removal of all encroachments such as petty shops and regulation of parking.

“While it is heartening to hear that the road is being widened, we hope all encroachments will be removed. To make it a model road, the Corporation has to keep it free of encroachments in future too,” said Padmanaban, a regular commuter.

According to a senior official, the road median will be built between Salai Road junction and the road overbridge across the railway track. The approach road on the bridge was not wide enough to extend the median over the structure.

Of late, the Karur Bypass Road-Tiruchi-Karur Highway intersection near Kalaignar Arivalayam in the city has also turned into a traffic bottleneck, affecting easy movement of vehicles.

The relaying of the road over the bridge will come as relief to road users. However, many motorists demand installation of automatic traffic signals on this end to streamline traffic flow at the junction.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/hotogd/article30916472.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26MAKarur-Bypass,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/karur-bypass-road-work-in-progress/article30916474.ece
470,2020/02/25,Railway Protection Force personnel floored by mundane queries,"Of 50,000 calls received by helpline last year, security-related ones were 83

Nearly a month ago, personnel of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) on night shift at the divisional security control room here received a message over phone in the railway security helpline number informing them of a passenger who fell down from Chennai-bound Ananthapuri Express beyond Ariyalur.

Acting swiftly on the call made by a rail traveller on board the train, the Railway Protection Force personnel alerted the railway control room at Tiruchi divisional office and the train was stopped midway for a few minutes to take the injured passenger.

In another recent instance, the Security Helpline received a call informing the personnel about the occupation of seats by others in a coach meant for the physically challenged and seeking assistance.

The Security Helpline 182 created for rail travellers seeking security-related assistance from the force has been receiving a spate of calls from public on a daily basis.

However, the non-security related calls accounts for the maximum notwithstanding periodic campaigns by the RPF personnel regarding the facility and the nature of complaints that could be conveyed in the dedicated number.

In the last one year (January 2019 to January 2020), the Security Helpline in Tiruchi Division received a little over 50,000 calls from public. However, security-related calls to the helpline number were merely 83 during this period.

RPF personnel here say the security helpline created in Tiruchi Division had received non-security calls seeking gas connection, cinema tickets and even petty issues from callers.

The helpline number was created for the benefit of the travellers to keep the RPF personnel informed about security-related issues such as theft of passenger belongings, nuisance in compartments in moving trains, occupation of seats by normal passengers in coaches meant for the physically challenged, suspicious looking objects on board trains and on platform and those seeking medical assistance for ailing passengers, say RPF officials.

Three dedicated telephone lines have been set apart for the security helpline at the RPF divisional security control room here which is equipped with an automatic calling device. RPF personnel are deployed round-the-clock at the security control room to receive calls from passengers for prompt action.

The call attended by the field-level RPF personnel manning the security control room is conveyed to their respective jurisdictional officers for initiating appropriate action and to lend necessary assistance.

Complete details are obtained from the passenger making the call including the train name, coach number, place where the train was moving currently among others to render speedy assistance. Some times the information is passed on to the escort teams deployed on board trains.

The information is conveyed back to the passenger who had made the call. Every call is recorded automatically and the number noted down for initiating necessary action.

The number of calls received and the action taken is conveyed to the RPF higher ups time-to-time.

Calls made within the limits of Tiruchi Railway Division to the security helpline lands at the RPF divisional security control room at Tiruchi, says the officials.

The accused, S. Kishanth, 21, of Chathiramani in Perambalur district, and K. Palanisamy, 21, of Valaiyur near Manachanallur in Tiruchi district, also allegedly confessed to killing 18-year-old K. Perumal with a boulder in 2017. Perumal was the brother of Palanisamy.

A police press release said the couple, A. Ramesh, 37, and R. Latha, 38, were asleep in front of their house on April 23, 2018, when they were attacked with deadly weapons by the men. The woman died on the spot, while Ramesh succumbed to injuries later at hospital. Further, a motorcycle at the spot was found stolen.

Acting on a complaint preferred by Ramesh’s brother Rajkumar, Siruganur police registered a case of murder and launched investigation. A special team was constituted on the instruction of Superintendent of Police, Tiruchi, Ziaul Haque to probe the case and arrest the killers.

During investigation, it came to light that the registration plate of the stolen motorcycle had been changed to Tamil and was involved in an accident case in Veppur police station in Cuddalore district.

Based on the lead, the special team tried to find the owner of the vehicle and the rider. During investigation it was established that it was the same motorcycle that was reported stolen in the double murder case and two men, S. Kishanth and P. Manikandan, were the riders.

It came to light that Kishanth and his friend Palanisamy murdered the couple and stole the motorcycle, ₹3,000 cash and a gold ring and chain worn by Ramesh. Kishanth and Palanisamy allegedly confessed to killing the couple.

477,2020/02/25,Thanjavur college summons parents of 14 students booked for anti-CAA stir,"The students have had an FIR registered against them for “unlawful assembly” for taking part in a demonstration on December 16

The Raja Serfoji Government Arts College in Thanjavur has summoned the parents of 14 students against whom the police have registered an FIR for participating in an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act demonstration. The students were booked by the Medical College Police on charges of mobilising their college-mates for the demonstration organised by the Students Federation of India (SFI) at Thanjavur on December 16, 2019.

The police charged them with being instrumental in the “unlawful assembly” of the college students on Tiruchi Road with an intention to stage the demonstration.

A week ago, the names of the students included in the FIR was forwarded to the college authorities. Following this, the college authorities have issued notices to their parents asking them to appear before the principal along with their wards to give an explanation. College authorities said their objective was to protect the students from legal issues which would affect their career prospects.

However, SFI office-bearers termed the move as an attempt to curb the students’ freedom of expression. Alleging that the 14 students were not allowed to mingle with other students in their classrooms, an SFI office-bearer claimed that this treatment had caused severe stress to the students and thereby affected their studies.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/thanjavur-college-summons-parents-of-14-students-booked-for-anti-caa-stir/article30912833.ece

479,2020/02/25,ISL | Chennaiyin finishes fourth,"Coyle’s side set to take on Goa in semifinal

Chennayin FC drew 2-2 with NorthEast United FC here on Tuesday to finish fourth on the table and will now take on FC Goa in the play-offs of the Indian Super League.

Masih Saighani fired Chennaiyin into the lead (17th minute) before two goals in either half by Martin Chaves (43rd, 71st) seemed to have handed all three points for NorthEast United. But a late equaliser from Lallianzuala Chhangte (90+3) ensured the visitors took a point.

NorthEast with 14 points finished on the ninth spot.

Chennaiyin, on the other hand, finished fourth with 29 points and will now take on FC Goa in the play-offs. The other play-off will feature Bengaluru FC and ATK.

Big changes

With not much riding on this game, both the teams made big changes to their starting XI’s with as many as 19 Indian players involved.

While Masih Saighani was the only overseas player for Chennaiyin FC, Martin Chaves and Jose Leudo were the foreigners for the home side.

The opening exchanges were slow and scrappy. The first chance fell for Ninthoinganba Meetei who saw his shot on goal deflected away by an alert Deepak Tangri.

In the 17th minute, Chennaiyin surged ahead after NorthEast failed to clear a throw-in into the box. Saighani reacted quickly to lash a left-footed shot past Sanjiban Ghosh in the NorthEast goal.

The visitors tried to keep possession after going ahead and did have a few chances to double their lead. Anirudh Thapa did well to make some room to shoot inside the box but saw Leudo block it away for a corner.

A few minutes before half-time, Leudo helped NorthEast claw its way back into the game. His brilliant cross-field pass saw Meetei get ahead of Tondonba Singh into the penalty box. The left-back brought the NorthEast attacker down and concede a penalty.

The referee also deemed the foul worthy of a red card and sent Tondonba off. Chaves duly converted the spotkick and pulled NorthEast level.

Chennaiyin was on the backfoot after the restart. However, NorthEast lacked a bit of quality as a goal eluded it. Chaves then took matters into his own hands in the 71st minute. Nim Dorjee Tamang laid off the ball for Chaves on the edge of the box. The Uruguayan sent in a terrific volley to pull the Highlanders ahead.

However, there was a late twist in the tale as substitute Lallianzuala Chhangte scored the equaliser for Chennaiyin in injury time with a smart shot from the edge of the box.

The result: NEUFC 2 (Martin Chaves 43 & 71) drew with Chennaiyin FC 2 (Masi Saighani 17, Lallianzuala Chhangte 90+4).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/isl-chennaiyin-finishes-fourth/article30916284.ece
480,2020/02/25,Premier Leagues | Liverpool overcomes West Ham’s challenge,"League leader capitalises on Fabianski’s errors to keep home record in tact

Runaway Premier League leader Liverpool had to come from behind —and needed some help from two goalkeeping blunders - to beat lowly West Ham United 3-2 in a thrilling game and maintain its 100% home record on Monday.

Trailing 2-1 late in the second half, West Ham keeper Lukasz Fabianski was twice at fault as Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane ensured Liverpool prevailed to equal the record of 18 consecutive top-flight wins set by Manchester City in 2017.

Juergen Klopp’s side now needs 12 points from 11 games to make sure of its first league title in 30 years.

It looked like business as usual for Liverpool, unbeaten in the league and now with a 22-point advantage at the top, when it scored in the ninth minute as Georginio Wijnaldum headed home Trent Alexander-Arnold’s whipped cross from right.

Three minutes later, though, West Ham drew level with Issa Diop’s angled header from a Robert Snodgrass corner beating keeper Alisson Becker.

Virgil van Dijk headed against the bar for Liverpool but Anfield was stunned in the 54th when Hammers substitute Pablo Fornals turned a low cross from Declan Rice into the far corner.

Facing the possibility of its first defeat of the Premier League campaign, Liverpool inevitably piled on the pressure but their usually deadly frontline was misfiring.

A Fabianski error allowed Klopp’s side to equalise in the 68th —Salah’s tame shot from an Andy Robertson pull back creeping through the legs of the Polish keeper.

Fabianski was at fault again when he came off his line but failed to stop Alexander-Arnold looping the ball over him to Sadio Mane who slotted home with nine minutes left. With the assist, Alexander-Arnold equalled his tally, set last season, of 12 —a Premier League record for a defender. Mane had the ball in the net again in the 86th minute but his effort was ruled out for offside after a swift VAR review.

Defeat leaves the Hammers on 24 points from 27 games, a point behind Aston Villa in the safety zone.

The results: Liverpool 3 (Wijnaldum 9, Salah 68, Mane 81) bt West Ham 2 (Diop 12, Fornals 54).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/c6slf2/article30916071.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26EURO,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/euro-leagues-liverpool-overcomes-west-hams-challenge/article30916072.ece
481,2020/02/25,Champions League preview | Manchester City targets role reversal,"Real Madrid’s record is the envy of Europe; Lyon locks horns with Juventus

Manchester City will be up against both Real Madrid and its reputation on Wednesday as the Champions League’s biggest winner plays one of its biggest underachiever at the Santiago Bernabeu.

After City’s win over Leicester on Saturday, Pep Guardiola said: “We will try to be ourselves. We can win and we can lose but we must try to be ourselves.”

Yet in some ways, City will seek a role reversal too.

Real’s record is the envy of Europe but in particular by teams like City, whose financial might and technical talent has translated only into disappointment outside domestic competition.

In the time City has won three Premier League titles and five domestic cups, it has gone past the Champions League’s quarterfinals only once, reaching the last four in 2016, only to be beaten by Real.

Zinedine Zidane’s side, meanwhile, have surrendered dominance in La Liga to Barcelona but made amends for one Spanish league title in seven years by winning four Champions Leagues out of the last six.

Few would argue that quality explains the difference. Madrid’s success has certainly been due in part to the brilliance of Cristiano Ronaldo but City has perhaps boasted an even better all-round collection of players and their excellence in England points to a club well-equipped to excel in Europe.

Ruthless

Real believes this tournament is its own, a conviction based on historic success that makes it assured under pressure and ruthless in the decisive moments.

“When you have a history of the (Alfredo) di Stefano period, winning five or six European Cups at that time, it means a new player that comes to Real Madrid and puts on that shirt knows ‘we have to defend our history’,” said Guardiola.

‘Extraordinary’

Anthony Lopes described Cristiano Ronaldo as “extraordinary”, and the Lyon goalkeeper knows how big a job he faces keeping his Portuguese international colleague quiet when the French side faces Juventus.

“I have been lucky enough to play alongside him. He is the captain and an extraordinary personality, a great man,” Lopes said when asked about playing with Ronaldo.

“I have gone to major tournaments with him, the Euro and the World Cup, where you have to develop links to those around you, and to do what he does every day is quite incredible,” Lopes added.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/2iuk68/article30915912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26REAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/champions-league-preview-manchester-city-targets-role-reversal/article30915914.ece

Director-General (Prisons and Correctional Services) Md. Ahsan Reza on Monday said the department is drawing up a blueprint to start a society that would take care of convicts after their release.

Mr. Reza was addressing the media after inaugurating the spice packaging unit set up at a cost of ₹38 lakh at the Visakhapatnam Central Prison. He said there was a need to take care of released convicts and the society would work in that direction, drawing from the system in vogue in Tamil Nadu.

“We will build a case file of all convicts during their stay in the prison. We will analyse their strength, weaknesses and skills, and based on the feedback, we will try to rehabilitate them,” he said.

Mr. Reza said plans were afoot to allow the family members to interact with the convicts. “We will conduct a mela at the jail premises on important days such as Independence Day and Republic Day and invite family members to interact with the convicts,” he said.

On skill development initiatives, he said a modular furniture centre would be opened at Kadapa jail very soon. “Funds generated from such centres will be given back to the convicts,” he said.

The D-G said a representation had been made to the government to improve the quality of rice that is served to convicts and remand prisoners.

On prisons being overcrowded, he said, “Except the Central Prison at Rajahmahendravaram, all the others are adequately spaced. We have sent proposals for two more prisons — at Tirupati and in the Guntur-Vijayawada region.” The government had agreed to list all convicts under the Aarogyasri health programme, he added.

Gainful employment

Earlier, inaugurating the spices unit which has the capacity to produce and package chilli powder, turmeric and coriander powder , he said the products would be first used in the prison the balance would be packaged and sold under the brand name ‘Sudhaar’.

“The convicts will trained in use of machines, so that they can have a gainful employment after their release,” said Mr. Reza.

Ministers M. Sucharita, Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao, P. Viswaroop and Taneti Vanitha on Monday condemned the attack on Bapatla MP N. Suresh.

Speaking to the media here, the Ministers alleged that the Telugu Desam Party was using women from Amaravati region as a shield for attacking its political opponents.

“TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu is misleading farmers of Amaravati region for his political gain. Those involved in the attack on Bapatla MP will not be spared. The government will take stringent action,” the Ministers said.

Mr. Srinivasa Rao pointed out that had the TDP government constructed permanent structures in Amaravati, situation would not have been like this today.

Andhra Pradesh Village Organisation Assistants (animators) Employees’ Association has condemned the arrest of the VOAs and resource persons (RPs) who wanted to represent their problems to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy at the Visakhapatnam airport on Monday.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy landed in Vizag before proceeding to Vizianagaram where he launched the ‘Jagananna Vasathi Deevena’ scheme.

Salary arrears

“The resource persons have not received salaries for 14 months and VAOs for five months. They reached the airport to submit a representation to the Chief Minister. The VAOs and resource persons were told that they would be taken to the Chief Minister, but made to get into a jeep and driven to police station,” a statement quoted association honorary president V.V. Srinivasa Rao as saying. The government has issued a circular saying that their services would be dispensed with after the completion of three-year term and those above 40 years of age would also be removed from the job.

490,2020/02/25,Vizag police begin ground work in view of Executive capital plan,"Small flyovers, smart traffic signals, FoBs on NH-16 under consideration

The city police are anticipating that managing traffic would be a major challenge if Visakhapatnam is made the Executive capital of the State. To deal with the situation, it is learnt that the police have started the ground work and exploring several options to ensure the safe and smooth flow of vehicular traffic.

Senior police officials say that even as the number of vehicles on road will go up by a few thousand once the city is made the Executive capital, the challenging task will be managing the 72-km stretch of the National Highway-16, which passes through the city. This stretch is also the arterial route connecting Anakapalle with Vizianagaram, touching upon important strategic locations including the airport and railway station. Grapevines are abuzz that the stretch is likely to be the main connecting route from the airport to the proposed capital region.

Apart from the officegoers and students, the NH-16 is also used by bureaucrats and political leaders who drive in convoys. Now, the challenge is to make the NH-16 a safe route for hassle-free travel, keeping the traffic snarls under check.

The accidents on this stretch are also high and it accounts for almost 40% of all fatal and major road accidents reported from the city, says Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar Meena.

There are a number of engineering defects and bottlenecks that need to be rectified, says ACP (traffic) M.R.K. Raju.

The police are exploring several options. There is an immediate need to build a few flyovers, at least smaller ones, to ensure smooth flow of traffic.

It is learnt that the police have identified five major junctions for this – Marikavalasa, Hanumanthawaka, Maddilapalem, Thatchetlapalem and Gajuwaka.

“Even small flyovers will do as they will facilitate flow of traffic in one direction, making the left and right turns free,” observes a senior police officer.

According to Mr. Meena, the traffic signals at many junctions need to be realigned and adjusted to the time, depending on the flow of traffic. “We have identified many areas which need smart traffic signals,” he says.

The city police have also identified locations to build 24 underpasses or foot over-bridges (FOBs) along the 72-km NH stretch.

Staff crunch

“Pedestrians become the victims of many accidents. That is why we have proposed 24 underpasses or FOBs, covering all the junctions,” says Mr. Raju.

Another immediate challenge for the traffic police would be the staff strength. There is an immediate need for increase in the traffic staff by about 25%. “The traffic department has a strength of about 800 men and officers now. There is a need for a staff strength of at least 200 more. Even the number of home guards, assigned to the department, needs to be enhanced from 300 to 450,” says the Police Commissioner.

Another vital issue which needs to be addressed is parking lots.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/9zn15r/article30907745.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24-traffic-graphiccol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/vizag-police-begin-ground-work-in-view-of-executive-capital-plan/article30907746.ece
491,2020/02/25,A Partition-era graphic novel,"Humorous and touching, Chhotu: A Tale of Partition and Love (Penguin) draws parallels between the Chandni Chowk of then and now, and all its characters are animals

A young boy (monkey) falls in love with the new girl (deer) in school. The pangs of puppy love are simple, sweet and have their funny moments, but are stoppered by a historic plot twist. Partition strikes what used to be undivided India, and our star-crossed love story set in the Chandni Chowk of yesteryears is suspended in limbo.

There is a reason Chhotu: A Tale of Partition and Love (Penguin), by Varud Gupta and Ayushi Rastogi, has been garnering eyeballs and rave reviews. The reason could be the stark and monochromatic art, simplistic yet multifaceted characters, the fable-esque treatment or the wry humour that blends well with the gripping storytelling. Or, it could just be the fact that one does not expect the distinct worlds of Partition literature and graphic novels to overlap, and certainly not in a Delhi that has educational tigresses and peacefully hardworking elephants as parent figures.

But for co-creators Varud and Ayushi, this creation was a nearly organic no-brainer. The duo, second cousins based in Delhi, explains over a phone call that the story borrows heavily from the memories shared by Varud’s maternal and Ayushi’s paternal grandfathers, who are brothers and lived through Delhi at the time of Partition. The magic of Delhi back then, and their own experiences of Delhi today, oscillate throughout the novel in a mood-centric time travel of sorts.

Varud elaborates on this using the example of this favourite character. “Naai, the barber, is a character who came through a WhatsApp message my grandfather sent me — my grandfather recently learnt to use WhatsApp. The message recounted how integral the naais ( barbers) were to Chandni Chowk back then, from spreading gossip to even acting as matchmakers.”

That is just one among many stories these grandchildren treasure well into their late 20s — “many of them show how Chandni Chowk’s inherent character was a blend of multiple communities living together,” adds Varud. This inclusive, cosmopolitan mix is what the duo wants to highlight, particularly in the context of Indian politics today. “Our target readers are children in school, and adults right up to 35 year-olds. People who are still finding their voice, who will relate to a coming-of-age story of a young boy,” says Ayushi, “Who need to hear that even if you are just one person, you can still make a difference for good.”

Having said that, however, the book has clearly managed to cross boundaries of age. The duo has been invited to talks at design schools, lunches by historic researchers, and everything in between. Clearly, something has hit home.

492,2020/02/25,"With 'Kali Yuga: The Ascension', Jatin Gupta presents a fictional feel to mythological narrative","Revisiting mythology with a twist

Keeping with the trend of releasing promo videos prior to a book launch, author Jatin Gupta released a video of his book Kali Yuga: The Ascension (Rupa Publications, ₹295). The animated promos with captivating background music were with a purpose. “I wanted to introduce the characters of my book and create a familiarity with readers. When I started to write the book, I had 27 strong characters divided into five clans. The videos are nothing less than what you see for a motion picture and all of it is to amp up the hormone levels of the readers,” says Jatin Gupta.

The author who started writing the book in 2014 says he was way too kicked when his wife compared the baseline of his story for the novel with Lord of the Rings and War Lord. “It wasn’t my intention but the unintentional familiarity with a context to Indian mythology got me thinking,” he adds.

First fiction

Jatin Gupta is the head of business operations at a gaming company. He’s a management professional with over 15 years of work experience in consumer products, consulting, financial services and the gaming industry. After having handled various leading positions with organisations like Deloitte and Invesco, he wrote a few self-help books. A traveller at heart, Jatin, also likes to indulge in the world of biographies and fiction often. “This book happens to be my first in the fiction genre,” says Jatin.

As a reader he says he loves moody narration and has a special liking to reaching out for books on Indian mythology. “The discussions of Phantom and Armageddon apart, Hindu mythology also has a take on how the world will end. My book chronicles the path of the process,” he adds.

Jatin claims, his book will be an enthralling tale of many centuries ago, set in the mythical land of Shivpuri in the Himalayas. Kali Yuga: The Ascension sets out to answer this question.

“Guru Parshuram, guide and leader of the five outcast clans of the Rudra Sena — Him Manavs, Bhuals, Aghoras, Nand Garajnas and Agneyas — prepares for the prophesied reincarnation of Lord Anjaneya in one of the clans. What follows is a roller coaster ride that takes readers deep into a mystical, magical world of honour, valour, bravery and self-sacrifice, as the timeless clash of good and evil unfolds,” he explains.

Is the book relevant to a generation that is hooked onto PUBG and constantly debating the situation we are living in on social media?

“This book is meant for anyone in the age group of 14 to to 34 years. For this age group it will be like visiting a fantasy world. For those in the age group of 34 to 54 years this book will make them revisit Indian mythology without questioning their belief,” adds Jatin who feels that his book will be “fantastic on screen”.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/vc74ih/article30910796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym25jatin,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/jatin-gupta-kali-yuga-the-ascension-motion-rupa-publication/article30910797.ece
493,2020/02/25,Daruvala gears up for a big challenge,"Signed up by Red Bull for its junior driver programme

India’s Formula One hopeful Jehan Daruvala’s career got a huge boost last week after Red Bull signed him for the junior driver programme and also confirmed his participation in the FIA F2 championship for 2020 with Carlin.

The Mumbai lad finished third in the F3 championship last year and was in the title hunt till the last race and had an impressive season with two wins and seven podiums.

Steady progress

The 21-year-old who was picked by the Force India Formula One team right from his karting days has been making steady progress in the single-seater ladder in Europe and has now reached the penultimate step to F1.

After Force India folded up in 2018, the Indian youngster had no tie-ups with an F1 team but says in hindsight it was a good thing since his performances last year helped him secure Red Bull backing.

Speaking to The Hindu, Daruvala said, “It is a big thing for me. This is the biggest stepping stone for a driver to be part of the Red Bull programme.” The Red Bull programme has produced drivers like Sebastian Vettel, Daniel Ricciardo, Max Verstappen, Carlos Sainz Jr.

At the same time, the programme run by Dr Helmut Marko, a former racing driver known for being a taskmaster, is a tough one with no place to hide.

The Indian, though, is unfazed by the tough approach Red Bull employs saying, “It is a good balance of pressure because they give you the opportunity. It is only if you are no longer the right person for them, they drop you. “For the season, there are no specific targets from Red Bull but I would like to be consistently fighting at the sharp end of the grid.”

The season is the most important one for the Indian and he is already looking to fine-tune his race-craft as he steps up a level. “I would like to be a bit more aggressive in opening laps and be a bit more sharp with regard to decision making going into the first turn.”",motorsport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/motorsport/91197c/article30916121.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26DARU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/motorsport/daruvala-gears-up-for-a-big-challenge/article30916122.ece
