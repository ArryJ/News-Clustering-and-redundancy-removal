0,['11/02/2020'],"Microgreens are all the rage, so grow them at home","Ever noticed how your neighbourhood vegetable vendor always has his nose and mouth nicely covered with a kerchief or mask while handling the veggies? Has it occurred to you that he is conscious of the copious amounts of pesticides on them? If you have answered yes to both, you may also be among the growing number of people who make a conscious effort to not only rid these vegetables of this poison, but also grow some of them in the space available to you. These days, eating healthy is not just about making the right choice of food items and cutting down on oil, salt, sugar, etc. It is just as much about ensuring that you source products that are grown organically, without chemical fertilizers and pesticides. And the best way to do that is to grow your own veggies as far as possible. The easiest to do is to grow microgreens at home.According to Anamika Bist, who promotes community farming through her enterprise, the mismatch in demand and supply of microgreens is a major factor for people growing them in their own homes. “Microgreens are healthy and tasty, and are a part of the menu in most urban homes today. But they are not readily available in the market at most times. Even if you do find them in the market, they are very expensive. Add to that the fact that they could be sprayed with pesticides, it makes better sense to just grow them at home. You don’t need a lot of space or equipment and it doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket. This could be why there has been a spurt in the number of people who have taken to it,” says Anamika.City-based diet consultant Anu Gayathri says that microgreens pack in a lot of nutrients, which is why they are a rage today. “Microgreens are rich in Magnesium, Manganese and Iron, among others, and are usually consumed raw, thereby retaining their nutritive value, unlike other mature greens that have to be cooked leading to nutrient loss,” says Anu adding, “Even though we consume microgreens in small portions, the absorption of nutrients is more, because they are available in higher quantities.”Arundathi Shiggaon, an early childhood educator, says, “Growing microgreens is very easy. You need basic equipment like a tray or a bowl, cocopeat, a little manure and the seeds. Start with simple varieties like methi, coriander, radish or fennel, before moving on to the more complex ones like sunflower and flax seeds.”What you will needA tray or a containerCocopeatManure (optional)SeedsWaterPlace the tray or the container in a partially sunny spot.

Actors Raksh, Bhavani Singh, Amrutha Ramamoorthi, Aishwarya Pisse , Deepika and Jagannath Chandrashekhar , are working around their hectic shooting schedules to make elaborate plans.The actor got married to his long-term girlfriend Anusha in May, but has been busy since then with shoots for his film debut and TV series. “Since I have been so busy, I did not even get to take Anusha on a honeymoon trip. And now that I am in the midst of promotions for film Naragunda Bandaya, which is releasing this month, I may not even get time to spend a cozy Valentine's Day with her. So, I have decided to make the most of the time we have before that and plan to take her on a bike ride to Mysuru, which is something she really likes, ” says Raksh.Bhavani Singh married Pankaja Shivanna in November and is looking at celebrating the day of love amid nature. “We are both nature lovers.

5,['11/02/2020'],Raveena Tandon: I am doing a powerful role in KGF sequel,"We recently reported that Bollywood actress Raveena Tandon is returning to Kannada cinema after a gap of nearly two decades, with the sequel to Yash’s multilingual film, KGF : Chapter 2. Now, there is an update on that — the ‘mast mast’ hudugi has already begun shooting in Mysuru , and she is all praise for the director of the film, Prashanth Neel . Excerpts from a conversation…“I was in talks with the KGF team for quite some time, and have been fairly impressed by its storyline. Prashanth had narrated the script to me long before I watched the first part. Later, when I saw the film, I was blown away by its edgy, new-age cinema approach,” says Raveena. “Having said that, it was important for me to thoroughly understand the narrative and its course in the second part. My character in the sequel is so powerful that I couldn’t say no to it,” says Raveena, who will be shooting for a week in Mysuru, before travelling to Hyderabad for the next leg of the schedule.Raveena seems to be extremely fond of Prashanth. “He is such a cool and composed young man. There is an air of calmness around him. But, when you see the work he does on the big screen, it is incredible. This is what makes him so special,” she says.Raveena’s last outing in Sandalwood was when she was part Upendra directorial, Upendra. Ask the actress if it only takes filmmakers who have attained a cult status in Kannada cinema to get her to do films here, and she responds, “Upendra had a story that was much ahead of its time. And the movie was a phenomenal success. The concept, thinking and vision behind the project were such that it easily qualified as new-age cinema. Similar is the case with KGF. When Prashanth narrated parts of the sequel to me, it already felt phenomenal. When a film offers something challenging, it always makes the cut for me.”Unlike many of her contemporaries, Raveena has not been seen in as many films during recent times. “I am a little choosy when it comes to films now. I have been offered a lot of roles, in films as well as in web series. But, honestly, I’ve also maintained that acting in films is only a part of my life. Between taking care of my kids and managing home and running a production house, I have been quite busy. Hence, I choose to do roles that really excite me,” she explains.“My love affair with Mysuru and Bengaluru started when my parents took me and my brother on a road trip from Mumbai to Kanyakumari. I fondly recall this green belt that we travelled through. We had a stopover at Mysuru, and visited Mysore Palace and also went for the lights and sound show at KRS. Also, in the 90s, most of the Bollywood song sequences were filmed in Mysuru and Ooty. For instance, the Elo Ji Sanam song from Andaz Apna Apna was shot in Ooty.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74064038,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-94770/74064038.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/raveena-tandon-i-am-doing-a-powerful-role-in-kgf-sequel/articleshow/74063959.cms

Ever noticed how your neighbourhood vegetable vendor always has his nose and mouth nicely covered with a kerchief or mask while handling the veggies?

If you have answered yes to both, you may also be among the growing number of people who make a conscious effort to not only rid these vegetables of this poison, but also grow some of them in the space available to you. These days, eating healthy is not just about making the right choice of food items and cutting down on oil, salt, sugar, etc. It is just as much about ensuring that you source products that are grown organically, without chemical fertilizers and pesticides. And the best way to do that is to grow your own veggies as far as possible. The easiest to do is to grow microgreens at home.

What’s pushing people to grow microgreens at home?

According to Anamika Bist, who promotes community farming through her enterprise, the mismatch in demand and supply of microgreens is a major factor for people growing them in their own homes. “Microgreens are healthy and tasty, and are a part of the menu in most urban homes today. But they are not readily available in the market at most times. Even if you do find them in the market, they are very expensive. Add to that the fact that they could be sprayed with pesticides, it makes better sense to just grow them at home. You don’t need a lot of space or equipment and it doesn’t burn a hole in your pocket. This could be why there has been a spurt in the number of people who have taken to it,” says Anamika.

Nutritive value make microgreens a rage

City-based diet consultant Anu Gayathri says that microgreens pack in a lot of nutrients, which is why they are a rage today. “Microgreens are rich in Magnesium, Manganese and Iron, among others, and are usually consumed raw, thereby retaining their nutritive value, unlike other mature greens that have to be cooked leading to nutrient loss,” says Anu adding, “Even though we consume microgreens in small portions, the absorption of nutrients is more, because they are available in higher quantities.”

Start with simple varieties of microgreens

Arundathi Shiggaon, an early childhood educator, says, “Growing microgreens is very easy. You need basic equipment like a tray or a bowl, cocopeat, a little manure and the seeds. Start with simple varieties like methi, coriander, radish or fennel, before moving on to the more complex ones like sunflower and flax seeds.”

Grow your own microgreens

What you will need

A tray or a container

Cocopeat

Manure (optional)

Seeds

Water

Method:

Place the tray or the container in a partially sunny spot. Add cocopeat and organic manure (optional). Sow the seeds in the cocopeat mixture and mist it with water twice a day. Within 5-6 days the seeds will sprout. Once the seedlings are about two-inch tall, cut them using a pair of scissors. This is a one-time process and has to be repeated for fresh batches. (*Growing microgreens may not always yield the same result)

Tips:

Soak the seeds overnight before you sow them.

Keep the cocopeat moist and do not expose the tray to harsh sunlight.

Eat your greens

Here’s what to do with microgreens

Microgreens can be eaten raw

They can be used as garnish on toasts, pizzas or soup

They pack in a nutritive punch when added to salads

Stir fry with butter/ oil

Can be added to smoothies, shakes and juices

Use them in sandwich and wrap fillings

NEW DELHI: India has got one step closer to deploying a new missile shield over its Capital, with US state department notifying its Congress of the impending sale of an integrated air defence weapon system ( IADWS ) to New Delhi for $1.86 billion.TOI in July 2018 had first reported that India was moving swiftly ahead to acquire the IADWS or the National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System-II ( NASAMS-II ) from the US, which will be used along with indigenous, Russian and Israeli systems to erect an ambitious multi-layered missile shield over the National Capital Territory of Delhi against aerial threats ranging from drones to ballistic missiles.India and the US have already held several rounds of negotiations, including selection of sites for deployment of the missile batteries around Delhi, for the proposed sale under the American foreign military sales (FMS) programme, as was reported earlier by TOI.Once the deal is inked, the NASAMS-II deliveries will take place in two to four years, say sources. Though the US was also mounting pressure on India to also consider its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missile defence systems, New Delhi went ahead to ink the $5.43 billion (almost Rs 40,000 crore) deal with Russia for five squadrons of the advanced S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile systems in October 2018.As per the proposed overall air defence plan for Delhi, the innermost layer of protection will be through the NASAMS. It will be a combination of different weapons like Stinger surface-to-air missiles, gun systems and AIM-120C-7 AMRAAMs (advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles), backed by three-dimensional Sentinel radars, fire-distribution centers and command-and-control units. “The networked system, capable of even shooting around buildings, will take care of 9/11-like and other close-in threats,” said the source.The outermost layer of Delhi’s missile shield, in turn, will be provided by the indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD) system being developed by DRDO. This system’s AAD (advanced air defence) and PAD (Prithvi air defence) interceptor missiles are currently geared to intercept enemy missiles, in the 2,000-km class, at altitudes from 15-25 km and 80-100 km respectively.The second layer will be through the highly automated and mobile S-400 systems, which will have missiles with interception ranges of 120, 200, 250 and 380 kms, backed by their associated battle-management system of command posts and launchers, long-range acquisition and engagement radars.Then will come the Barak-8 medium-range surface-to-air missile systems, jointly developed by Israeli Aerospace Industries and DRDO, which have a 70-100 km interception range. The indigenous Akash area defence missile systems, with a 25-km range, in turn, will form the layer over the NASAMs.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74071210,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-27775,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/missile-shield-over-delhi-india-may-buy-nasams-ii-air-defence-system-from-us/articleshow/74071029.cms

14,['11/02/2020'],"Kashmir news: 25 foreign envoys to be taken on Jammu and Kashmir visit, Russia declines invite","This story is from February 11, 2020

Envoys from several countries were taken to Kashmir last month (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Russian ambassador to India Nikolay Kudashev won’t be visiting J&K despite having received an invite from the Indian government to visit the Union Territory, diplomatic sources here said. According to the Indian government, another lot of foreign envoys – 25 in all - based in Delhi will be taken to Kashmir this week.

The first visit of foreign envoys to Kashmir had been organised by Indian authorities in the second week of January.

Russia has stood firmly behind India on the government’s decision to revoke the special status of J&K and Kudashev was quoted as having said last month that Moscow never had any doubt about India’s approach to the Valley. He had said that Russia did not feel the need to find out what was happening in Kashmir as it was India’s internal matter and belonged to ""the Constitutional space of India.""

“It is not an issue in our bilateral ties. Those who believe this is an issue, those who are concerned about the situation in Kashmir, those who have doubt about Indian policy in Kashmir can travel to Kashmir. They could see for themselves. We never had any doubt,” he had said. Unlike last time though, India on this occasion extended an invite to Kudashev, which he declined.

The envoys are likely to land in Srinagar on Wednesday and, sources said, will be travelling to Jammu and Budgam as well. The envoys are expected to interact with locals and also attend a briefing by senior army officers.

Official sources here said that since the last visit of envoys to J&K on 9-10 January 2020, MEA had received several requests from foreign ambassadors here for a visit to the newly created UT. ""A group of Envoys from different geographical regions, will be visiting Jammu and Kashmir this week,"" said a source requesting anonymity.

Unlike last time, several envoys from European countries are likely to travel. Officials here didn’t rule out participation of French, EU and German envoys. While the last delegation comprised, among others, the US ambassador to India, European envoys had given it a miss. Some had reportedly said that they didn’t want a guided tour but Indian authorities had claimed it was more because of scheduling issues. Outgoing UK high commissioner Dominic Asquith had recently said British diplomats were very much interested in visiting Kashmir. The delegation will likely also have envoys from some Gulf countries.

16,['11/02/2020'],Isro veteran G Narayanan to head space PSU NSIL,"This story is from February 11, 2020

NEW DELHI: Veteran space scientist G Narayanan has been named the chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation’s newly formed commercial entity New Space India Ltd ( NSIL ).

Narayanan was earlier working as deputy director (systems reliability and quality assurance) at the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre ( LPSC ), a Thiruvananthapuram-based unit of Isro that designs, develops liquid propulsion stages for launch vehicles. Narayanan has to resign from Isro before taking charge of NSIL as the new commercial entity is a public sector undertaking.

Narayanan, who hails from Kerala’s Palakkad, had earlier worked as first secretary (space) at the Indian embassy in Paris. An alumnus of the College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram, Narayanan joined Isro in 1983.

NSIL was set up in March last year to meet the ever-increasing demands of the Indian space programme and commercially exploit the emerging global space market. It will also manufacture the small satellite launch vehicle (SSLV) or mini-PSLV in collaboration with the private sector and help in the production of polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) and other space-based products through the industry. For the SSLV launches, Isro is already working on a new launchpad in Kulasekarapattinam in Tamil Nadu.

Despite having commercial arm Antrix Corporation that handles commercial satellite launches, the department of space set up the NSIL in order to push transfer of Isro technologies to the industry and market spin-off technologies and services.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/isro-veteran-g-narayanan-to-head-space-psu-nsil/articleshow/74071920.cms
17,['11/02/2020'],"Randeep Hooda: The one thing that I lost as an actor is my vanity, and I am trying to get it back","Last seen in Baaghi 2 (2018), Randeep Hooda is all set to end his break from movies with director Imtiaz Ali’s Love Aaj Kal . In a chat with BT, the actor talks about working with Imtiaz, the young star cast of the film and missing out on the sports drama, ‘83. Read On...It is always a joy to work with Imtiaz, as he is organic in his approach. Talking about Love Aaj Kal, working on this film was a different experience altogether. The environment on the set was more fun, as this is a lighter film. Even Highway had romance, but it was tragic. It showed the complexities in a relationship between two individuals, who belong to different strata of society. But in Love Aaj Kal, they are from the same strata. Also, compared to Highway, I have a lot more dialogues in Love Aaj Kal. Highway was a well-made film, but the shooting process was not enjoyable. My character had a lot of emotions, which he was unable to express. To bring those expressions on screen was taxing. When Imtiaz narrated the script of Love Aaj Kal to me, I liked the concept of love set in two eras — in the 90s and the present times. As far as ‘kal’ is concerned, in the 90s, there was no social media, and people weren’t so casual about physical intimacy.The ‘aaj’, on the other hand, is high on finding love through social media and dating apps.Well, that has always been the case with me. I was appreciated in Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai (2010), but there was a lull post that. It was the same after Highway, Main Aur Charles (2015) and Sarbjit as well. I am just happy that in my journey as an actor, I got to portray a plethora of characters and work with many talented directors. Every movie has been special for me. After Sarbjit, I felt that I should take my craft a notch higher and signed Battle Of Saragarhi . I immersed myself in it, and did not take up any other projects for the next two years. However, the film didn’t happen and I ended up being on a hiatus. Then, Baaghi 2 happened in 2018 and now, I am back with Love Aaj Kal. In between, I shot for an international project for an OTT platform. I am also currently shooting for Radhe with Salman Khan, with whom I have done films like Kick (2014) and Sultan (2016). As an artiste, I explored my talent, and I am happy about that. However, the one thing that I lost as an actor, and which I am trying to get back, is my vanity (laughs)!I think they call me that because it is hard to make a parody of me. I see people imitating other actors, but maybe, they are unable to pin me down. As far as social media is concerned, there are times when I feel that I need to be more proactive, but at the same time, I strongly believe that your work should speak for itself, rather than you going all out. Having said that, I am active on social media — I put up wildlife pictures on Instagram and address social causes on Twitter. Overall, I want my work to speak for itself and I guess, it has not gone unnoticed to that great an extent.It is wonderful to work with a bunch of young actors, as they are high on energy. I like their enthusiasm to learn constantly and their willingness to surrender themselves to the director. In fact, Kartik and Sara were so good that they didn’t seem like newcomers. I had a lot of scenes with Sara, and she is extremely disciplined — she would wake up at 4 am, go to the gym, come on the set, get her hair and make-up done and by the time the camera is ready to roll, she would be ready with her lines. I was really impressed. She would bring healthy food from home, while I would be binging on burgers.I had put in a lot of effort for the film based on the Battle of Saragarhi. It is disappointing that all that hard work never reached the audience, and you do feel let down, but what can you do about it? In the end, one has to just pick up the positives and move on. I have imbibed the goodness of the character, and I also got to learn a lot about Sikhism from that project. In terms of ‘83, I would just say that as actors, we sometimes say ‘no’ to projects, but this time, it was the other way around. I wish the team well, and I am sure that it will be a great film to watch.No, there was no communication with me at all.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74062842,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-93481/74062842.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/randeep-hooda-the-one-thing-that-i-lost-as-an-actor-is-my-vanity-and-i-am-trying-to-get-it-back/articleshow/74062842.cms

At least not in the case of actors Nikkhil Arya and Ankit Mohan , who are a part of the TV show 'Haiwan', which is set to end in a few days. Things got ugly between the two last week, a day after they wrapped up shoot, prompting Nikkhil to file a non-cognisable complaint against Ankit for threatening him and his family, and using abusive and vulgar language.Ankit was apparently upset because their co-actor Gayathiri Iyer had stopped talking to him. He believed that Nikkhil had spoken ill about him because of which she started maintaining a distance. In a fit of rage, Ankit called Nikkhil, who had landed back in Pune (his hometown), and abused him. Over the next 48 hours, he sent several abusive messages and threatening voice notes, post which Nikkhil approached the Pune police.When we spoke to Nikkhil about this, he said, “Initially, I thought that it was just another bull on steroids. But when his abusive messages and voice notes went on for almost two days, I realised that he wasn’t in a normal state of mind. And then, he crossed all limits when he used the most derogatory language for the women in my house. That’s when I decided to take action.” Nikkhil, who has been a part of a number of popular TV shows over the years, added, “I wish people didn’t indulge in juvenile stuff and focussed on their job on the set, which is acting.”Ankit, who is married to actress Ruchi Savarn , admitted that he sent the messages in anger. He told BT, “I was upset as he spoke ill about me with Gayathiri because of which she stopped talking to me. I have worked hard to reach where I am and don’t appreciate anyone casting aspersions on my character. Yes, I lost my cool and in a fit of anger, abused him. But all I wanted was to evoke a response from him. When that didn’t happen, it further angered me. My emotions got the better of me.” When asked about the need to turn abusive and drag Nikkhil’s family into the fight, he replied, “I didn’t mean any of it.”Meanwhile, Gayathiri, who was in touch with Nikkhil till about a few days ago expressing shock over Ankit’s behaviour, seems to have had a change of heart. While those present on the set told us that she initiated the conversation regarding Ankit with Nikkhil, the actress told us otherwise. She said, “Nikkhil told me a few things about Ankit, which prompted me to maintain my distance from him. I was affected since it was a friendship of six months. But Ankit and I have clarified everything and are back to being friends. Having said that, he shouldn’t have abused Nikkhil.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74062969,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-59274/74062969.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/nikkhil-arya-files-police-complaint-against-ankit-mohan/articleshow/74062979.cms

NEW DELHI: Counting for the 70 assembly seats in Delhi will begin at 8am on Tuesday and trends will start pouring in around 11am. Officials said the votes will be counted at 21 locations in 11 districts. About 2,600 administrative officials will be involved in the process.

Though the official announcement of results will be done only in the evening, Election Commission officials said the winning candidate and the estimated margin of votes will be known by the afternoon.

The smaller the size of the constituency, the sooner the result will be announced.

East Delhi district election officer Arun Kumar Mishra said the counting centres have a three-tier security involving the local police, CAPF and paramilitary forces.

""The outermost ring will have Delhi Police personnel, while the second ring will have local police and CAPF. The innermost security ring will have paramilitary forces,"" he added.

The counting centre at Commonwealth Games Village has been set up as a model centre with state-of-the-art facilities, Mishra said.

In all, 33 counting observers have been appointed to oversee the process. The counting of votes will start with postal ballots.

Votes polled in EVMs will begin only after that. The EVM votes will be counted simultaneously at 10-14 tables set up for each assembly segment. Depending on the size of the constituency, the votes will be counted in 10-16 rounds.

After each round, the results will be uploaded on the ""Suvidha"" mobile app. Once all votes are counted, election officials will randomly pick VVPAT slips from five polling stations in each assembly segment and match the results with those generated by EVMs.

Paper chits with the number of each polling station in an assembly constituency will be put in a container and shuffled in presence of all candidates or their agents. The returning officer will then pick up five slips to tally with the EVM results.

""The paper trail of votes will be kept in separate bundles and then matched with the EVM results. The tabulation of paper trails will be carried out simultaneously. The result will be declared after completing the entire exercise,"" said an official.

NEW DELHI: In the next few hours, the fate of 672 candidates - 593 men and 79 women - in the electoral fray for 70 seats in Delhi Assembly would be known. Though the contest to form a government in Delhi is largely seen to be between the party in power, AAP, and BJP, Congress may emerge as a dark horse and upset calculations.Counting of votes will begin at 8am and which party gets the mandate to govern Delhi for the next five years will be known by 2pm.Stakes are high for the three political parties that ran a campaign for almost a fortnight before the votes were polled on February 8. Victory of AAP will validate its claims of doing good work in education, health and power sectors while looking after the vulnerable sections through free power, water and travel for women in public transport.Bharatiya Janata Party, which had been extremely critical of the five years of the Aam Aadmi Party government in the capital, made the work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government its election plank to woo voters apart from focussing on national issues such as abrogation of Article 370 and 35A in Kashmir, citizenship amendment law and protests against, a favourable judgment in the Ram Temple case and surgical strikes on Pakistan.The party, which is looking to form a government in Delhi after 22 years in exile, ran an aggressive campaign with Union home minister Amit Shah micro-managing everything on a day-to-day basis. Senior BJP functionaries, including several Union ministers and MPs from across the country, addressed close to 10,000 public meetings during the fortnight-long campaign, banking on planks of Hindutva and nationalism.Congress, on the other hand, made the legacy of the Sheila Dikshit government and infrastructure development during 1998-2013 when it was in power its main poll plank. Several senior Congress functionaries, including former party president Rahul Gandhi, AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and chief ministers of four states held public events in the last week of electioneering.The exit polls telecast by various TV channels have predicted a comfortable victory for AAP by giving it 44-68 seats in the 70-member House. In the 2015 assembly polls, AAP had won a record 67 seats and polled over 54% votes. BJP, which got over 32% votes in the last election, had won just three seats while Congress was decimated with a vote share of less than 10% and no seat. Most exit polls have predicted around 10-12 seats for the BJP, marginally better over the last assembly poll results and none for Congress.Both BJP and Congress have rubbished the exit poll results. BJP leaders exuded confidence ""based on a micro analysis of all seats. The exit polls are rough estimates, and I am confident that BJP will form the government in Delhi with full majority,"" said Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari, adding that they would win 45 of the 70 seats.

It will also decide whether a person, not belonging to a religious denomination, can file a PIL questioning validity of practices of that religion.In the process, SC rejected resistance from lawyers led by senior advocate Fali S Nariman, who argued against SC undertaking the exercise of laying down guidelines for courts to deal with cases involving a clash between faith and fundamental rights.Nariman had argued that the issues arose in petitions seeking review of the SC's judgment allowing the entry of women of all ages into the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple and a five-judge bench could not have in a review jurisdiction referred unconnected religious customs - curbs on entry of women into mosques, entry of Parsi women married outside the community into agiyaris and practice of female genital mutilation among Dawoodi Bohras - to a larger bench. The court, however, agreed with Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and said, ""We hold that this court can refer questions of law to a larger bench in a review petition.""Apart from defining the ambit of right to rel igion, and examining the implications of Articles 25 and 26, the SC will decide whether a person, not belonging to a religious denomination, can file a PIL questioning validity of customs and practices of that religion. Article 25, while guaranteeing freedom of conscience and free profession, practise and propagation of religion, subjects this to ""public order, morality and health"". It also allows the government to regulate or restrict by a law the economic, financial, political and other secular activities associated with religious practices. It also allows the government to pass a law to provide social welfare and reform or throw open public religious institutions belonging to Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists to all classes of persons belonging to these religious denominations.Article 26, guarantees right of every religious denomination to establish and manage religious institutions subject again to ""public order, morality and health"".

Former ICICI Bank MD Chanda Kochhar is among those facing investigation.

NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcing Directorate (ED) are investigating cases against half-a-dozen managing directors and CEOs of commercial banks, although no arrests have been made so far, the government informed Parliament on Monday.

Separately, the CBI has sought prosecution of over 800 public sector bank employees, including presidential appointees such as chairmen, MDs and executive directors of state-run entities since 2017. In at least 139 cases, the government had declined request for prosecution, the finance ministry said in Lok Sabha. The ministry, however, was silent on whether the probe involved serving or former top bankers. Apart from former ICICI Bank CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar , ex-PNB chief Usha Ananthasubramanian , and United Bank's former CMD Archana Bhargava and ex-UCO Bank boss Arun Kaul are among those facing investigation. An inquiry need not translate into prosecution.

In recent years, action against bankers has been on the rise. ""Banking corruption and occurrence of frauds was enabled by lack of discipline in the financial system and a lax credit culture across across various stakeholders. The role of bankers, too, was not as rigorously examined earlier, and auditors were not independently regulated. Through extensive reforms, change in credit culture has been instituted and controls have been tightened for every stakeholder in the financial system, which has enabled a tighter check on corruption,"" the government said.

29,['11/02/2020'],"Under oppn fire, BJP says SC’s quota ruling was on Cong govt’s 2012 order","This story is from February 11, 2020

Social justice and empowerment minister Thawarchand Gehlot

NEW DELHI: The government said on Monday that it was not party to a case where the Supreme Court ruled that it is not mandatory for states to implement quotas, and asserted that it is committed to reservations in the face of a concerted opposition attack in Parliament that the Centre had failed to defend the measures in court.

The MPs demanded that a review petition be filed in the SC. In Rajya Sabha too, the opposition came together to demand that the Centre approach the court on its ruling which held that Article 16(4) is enabling in nature permitting implementation of quotas but not making them mandatory. Disappointed with the Centre's response, the opposition staged a walkout.

Social justice and empowerment minister Thawarchand Gehlot said the Centre is committed to the welfare of SCs, STs and OBCs and will take ""appropriate steps"" after discussions at the ""highest level"". He said the Centre was not asked to file an affidavit.

Sources said the Centre believes it has options of judicial review and ordinance to redress the situation arising out of the SC's order. While the issue has not been formally taken up at the top echelons of government, there was a preliminary discussion in the SJE ministry on the sensitive subject.

The options have been exercised in recent years when the Centre found the court orders on Dalit rights and quotas unacceptable, be it the dilution of the Prevention of Atrocities Act and the 100-point roster for reservation in promotions. In Parliament, BJP alleged that the previous Congress government in Uttarakhand initiated the matter in 2012.

Gehlot said the top court order pertains to a 2012 decision of that government and asserted that the Centre is ""committed"" and ""dedicated"" to quotas for SCs, STs and OBCs.

A s soon as Question Hour started, Congress' Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury raised the issue. He was joined by others, including A Raja (DMK), Kalyan Banerjee (TMC), E T Mohammed Basheer (IUML), CPM's A M Ariff, Supriya Sule (NCP), Ritesh Pandey (BSP).

The SC has held that states are not bound to provide reservation in appointments and there is no fundamental right to claim quotas. The SC was dealing with pleas regarding the Uttarakhand government's September 5, 2012 move to fill up all posts in public services without quotas to SC/STs. The order was quashed by the HC.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh said Congress is trying to politicise a sensitive issue. Chowdhury and Banerjee said there has been an onslaught on SC/ST quota since the Modi government took over.

Anupriya Patel said one of the reasons for such rulings was low representation of SC/ST and OBCs in judiciary. ""The government should immediately intervene,"" she added.

In RS, leader of opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said it was a serious issue concerning about one-fourth of the country's population.

Bringing relief to hundreds of poor patients, the health ministry has finally decided to allow Ayushman Bharat beneficiaries to be given financial assistance up to Rs 15 lakh under the Rashtriya Aarogya Nidhi (RAN), a scheme meant for below poverty line families, if their treatment is not covered under Ayushman Bharat's approved list of packages.On January 31, the ministry issued a memorandum stating that ""if as per medical advice the suggested treatment is not covered under any of the approved list of packages of AB-PMJAY "", financial assistance up to Rs 15 lakh could be provided for treatment at government super speciality hospitals.Poor patients suffering from end-stage renal disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, aplastic anaemia and cancers needing transplant stand to benefit from this decision.Last month, TOI had reported the death of 17-year-old Pankaj, a patient of aplastic anaemia, who was prohibited from availing financial assistance under RAN because his name figured in the Ayushman database.

However, it wrote back to AIIMS on October 4 stating that the suggestions of the National Health Authority and AIIMS ""cannot be agreed to"" since there could be ""misuse"".""There are hundreds of patients who were being denied treatment in super specialty government hospitals across India because of the guidelines issued last year. It was frustrating for doctors to turn away patients whose lives could be saved,"" said Dr Vijay Gurjar, assistant professor in the department of Geriatrics at AIIMS, Delhi, who had championed the cause.According to the latest memorandum, the financial assistance will be in the form of 'one-time grant'.

PATNA: Two state Yuva JD(U) functionaries have been expelled for running a campaign on social media platforms in support of poll strategist Prashant Kishor, who was expelled from JD(U) on January 29 for his stand different from party line on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), NPR and NRC.

“While Chandan Kumar Singh, state general secretary and former president of Patna Mahanagar Yuva JD(U), was expelled for speaking in favour of the expelled JD(U) leader and poll strategist Prashant Kishor. Another state general secretary, Pawan Singh Rawat, has also been expelled for extending his support to rebel party leader and former state minister Narendra Singh,” Yuva JD(U) state president and MLA Abhay Kushwaha told TOI on Monday.

“Despite Kishor’s expulsion from the party, Chandan kept writing in his support on Facebook and WhatsApp. Similarly, Rawat has launched a campaign on his Facebook page urging people to attend a meeting called by former agriculture minister Narendra Singh at Jamui on February 16,” Kushwaha said. He said, both Chandan and Rawat continued to work against the party’s line despite warnings.

Still a JD(U) leader, Narendra is up in the arms against the state government ever since Munger SP Lipi Singh ordered to issue warrant of arrest against him and his son and former MLA Sumit Singh for their alleged involvement in a criminal case.

Narendra and his supporters on Sunday held a dharna in Patna to protest the action of Munger SP, who enjoys the support of a section of senior JD(U) leaders.

Rajkot: A man hacked his father to death in Datrad village of Talaja taluka, following a property dispute on Sunday night. The accused son was arrested on early Monday morning.

According to police, the accused, identified as Bharat Rathod, had killed his father Narshi Rathod (80) to death with an axe. Along with Bharat, police also arrested Bharat’s son Vishal and brother-in-law Arwind Makwana for helping Bharat in the crime.

Narshi had divided his land and had distributed among his two sons — Bhim Rathod and Sukha Rathod. However, he did not give share of his property to Bharat.

When Bharat asked for his share, Narshi would tell him that his brothers were giving him money and that if he started giving him money, he too would be given his share.

On the fateful night, a meeting of the Rathod family was organized which turned stormy with Bharat asking for his share of land from Narshi.

“When Narshi stubbornly refused to budge from his stand, Bharat allegedly dragged him down from the cot he was sitting on. When Narshi hit Bharat’s leg with a stick, an angry Bharat went into his house and came out with an axe with which he hit Narshi on his head. Vishal and Makwana were also involved in the attack,” said an official from Talaja police station.

Initially, the accused tried to mislead the cops by saying that unidentified robbers had attacked Narshi. However, when the police interrogated the accused, they broke down and confessed to their crime.

Sushil Kumar Modi

PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said on Monday that the project to incentivize and promote new scientific farming and crop cycle as necessitated by irregular weather conditions would be introduced in all the districts of the state from the next fiscal.

Modi said such a farming practice is already under implementation in 1,442 acres of land spread over 40 villages on an experimental basis in Gaya, Nawada, Nalanda, Bhagalpur, Banka, Munger, Khagaria and Madhubani districts and would now be replicated in rest of the districts.

The farming activities of selected farmers who have opted for this experimental farming practice in the eight districts are being guided and monitored by agriculture scientists, so that new crop cycle comes into use in the state in view of the adverse conditions caused by climate change and extreme weather conditions, Modi also said, adding that the government has allotted Rs60.50 crore to be spent over the next five financial years in the selected 40 villages.

Modi was addressing the farmers who had been invited to participate in the pre-budget consultative exercise on the agriculture sector to get their suggestions. Principal secretaries of finance and agriculture departments — S Siddharth and Sudhir Kumar, respectively — were also present on the occasion.

Modi said 1.20 crore farmers were getting money under various schemes directly into their personal bank accounts through the direct benefit transfer method, while Rs1,157.21 crore had been disbursed among 18.85 lakh farmers as assistance to them due to adverse weather conditions and natural disaster in the last two financial years.

Modi said the government has been trying to promote organic farming in the state due to the increased demand for farm products produced by that method. Accordingly, each farmer choosing to practice organic farming was being given Rs11,500 per acre of land as input subsidy. The budgetary allotment of Rs155 crore had been made for it in the 2019-20 fiscal.

He also pointed to 40-80% subsidy being given on the purchase of farm equipment, as part of the government’s bid for farm mechanization, adding that general category farmers were getting 75% subsidy, while those belonging to the extremely backward caste, scheduled caste and scheduled tribe sections were given 80%.

PATNA: Residents of several localities on Monday complained about garbage still strewn on streets even 48 hours after the sanitation workers of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) ended their indefinite strike on Saturday evening.

Patna mayor Sita Sahu had assured on Saturday that the city would be cleaned in 48 hours. Residents of Rupaspur, Bhikhna Pahadi, SK Puri and Jagdeo Path among other areas complained that neither garbage was removed nor bleaching powder was sprinkled in their localities.

Babita Kumari of Ram Krishna Nagar said the PMC is concentrating only on major roads and other posh areas for removing garbage. She complained that even door-to-door household garbage collection has not started in her neighbourhood. “People are still throwing garbage on roadside and in the overflowing dustbins,” Babita said.

Hemlata of Rajendra Nagar road number 12 complained of carcasses of cattle and dogs lying near a park in her neighbourhood. “We have even called the helpline number of PMC but no one came for cleaning,” she said.

Rajkesh Dubey near Bakri Bazaar at Station Road said the workers dumped all garbage at the proposed site for vending zone under Patna Smart City project. “They throw garbage as well as carcasses,” he said.

“Residents are still throwing garbage on the roadside instead of waiting for auto-tipper. In search of food, stray dogs and cattle tear open plastic bags and spill the waste over the road. It is simply sickening,” said Sharmishtha of Thakurbari Road.

PMC officials, on the other hand, claimed that the sanitation workers were continuously on the job. The mayor told this newspaper that all the major roads were cleaned. “We are now focusing on narrow lanes and other localities. The situation will be normal by the end of this week,” she said.

PMC’s public relations officer Harshita said the executive officers and sanitary inspectors have pressed all the 375 auto-tippers, 182 e-carts, JCB machines, automatic sweeping machines, hand-held fogging machines and vehicle mounted fogging machines into service to make the city clean.

“The PMC has set the target to remove all the garbage from secondary points in next three days. Also, people who are littering garbage will attract a fine up to Rs1 lakh,” she said.

The PMC’s social media pages, helpline numbers and City of Patna mobile application have also suddenly come alive as the civic body has been receiving a large number of complaints to remove garbage from their localities. Harshita said sanitary inspectors were redressing the complaints in 24 hours. “However, we are facing some issues in interior areas of the city. But the situation will improve in three days,” she said.

Representative image

PATNA: The state police have exposed close links of some country liquor brewers with the Maoists operating in Munger, Jamui and Lakhsarai districts.

The startling fact came to light during a special operation launched by the police to flush out Maoists in the three districts under Munger range. The police also destroyed the country brewing units in deep forests and hilly terrains during the recent drive.

Sharing details of the operation, DIG (Munger range) Manu Maharaaj said on Monday that some hardcore Maoist leaders, including Arjun Kora and Baleshwar Kora, revealed during interrogation that country liquor brewing units were running with the tacit support of the banned Naxal outfit.

The Maoist leaders also admitted that the tribal residents were being encouraged to brew liquor with mahua and supply the consignment to the liquor smugglers in the region. “Needless to say lion’s share of the income goes to the Naxal outfit,” the DIG said, quoting the Maoist leaders.

The police would intensify raids in the areas identified as ‘safe zone’ of liquor brewing in the three districts. “The motive behind the operation is to attack the sources of income of the Maoists. In Munger, the police operation met with success. Lakhisarai and Jamui are on the pipeline,” Maharaaj said.

More than 100 hardcore Maoist activists, including self-proclaimed commanders such as Ramesh Hebram, Kailu Kora and Gorelal Naiyar were arrested ever since the 2005-batch IPS officer was posted as DIG about a year ago. “We are motivating the tribals not to indulge in unlawful activates. At the same time, we are trying to provide them alternative sources of income,” Maharaaj revealed.

PATNA: The high-intensity explosion probably due to leakage from LPG cylinder at a house in Salimpur Ahra near Gandhi Maidan here on Monday morning has once again raised concern about safe handling of gas cylinders and precautions needed to be taken by the residents while using LPG in their homes.

According to police officials, there was no ventilation in the room where the cylinder was kept and gas leaked. Traffic SP D Amarkesh, who is incharge city SP (central), told this newspaper that the LPG leaked from the broken hosepipe and spread in the house. “There was no ventilation in the kitchen and all windows were closed. When a woman lit a matchstick, fire broke out,” he said.

Officials of Bihar Fire Services claimed that such incidents are quite common in state, but most of the fire incidents take place in rural areas during winter season.

RK Mishra, DG of Bihar Fire Services, told this newspaper that it was the second fire incident due to gas leakage in Patna in the last five months. “We have compiled the data of fire incidents in the state in the last five years and we are now trying to find out the reason behind such incidents. Accordingly, we will make people aware about precautions to be taken to prevent such incidents.”

Mishra said around 10,000 fire incidents occurred in Bihar in 2019. “We have conducted 3,000 fire audits and 5,000 mock drills across the state last year,” he said.

The oil marketing companies said they issued handbooks of dos and don’ts to people when they buy LPG connections and cylinder.

An official of Indian Oil Corporation Limited said most of the cooking gas fire incidents take place due to gas leakage from rubber tube, burner mistakenly kept on and poor handling of gas appliances. “We issue all important instructions about usage of cooking gas in our manual handbook but customers do not pay much attention to these things,” an official said.

Afreen Khatiq with husband Anwar

SURAT: In a bizarre case, a 22-year-old woman committed suicide after prolonged depression caused by her short height on Monday.

The woman Afreen Khatiq was found hanging by the ceiling fan at her house in Magdulnagar in Sachin GIDC area. She had sent her husband Anwar, who owns a photography studio, to purchase toilet cleaner. When he returned after an hour, he saw her hanging.

Anwar and other family members told police that Afreen was extremely depressed over her short height. She was around 3.9 foot while Anwar was 5.4 foot tall.

Seeing an advertisement on social media three months ago, she had also started taking some ayurvedic powder of a popular brand that promised to increase height. However, when the medication did not yield desired results, her depression aggravated.

""After attending family functions or community gatherings, Afreen often rued even kids were taller than her. She used to get very upset after visiting such functions and felt depressed,"" Anwar told TOI.

Anwar added that she looked constantly worried over the past few days. “She told me that despite all efforts and medicines, her height was not increasing. She had consumed three bottles of ashwagandha churna of a popular brand in three months but did not get any result,"" he added. Initially, officials of Sachin GIDC did not fully believe that this could be the reason for the drastic step. Cops verified the reason with neighbours and her parents too who live in Limbayat.

""Her neighbours and other known people confirmed that there was no other issue between the couple, but she was obsessed with her short height. She always express her wish to grow taller,"" said a police officer at Sachin GIDC police station.

Anwar had purchased three bottles the churna from a store of the brand in Bhestan area. Each bottle costs around Rs 105 and Afreen started drinking milk as per the directions mentioned on the bottle. She had even stopped consuming oily food and started dieting to ensure that the medicine has the desired effect, her family members said.

Before marriage too, Afreen had tried various medicines but her height did not increase.

PUNE: The district consumer court has ruled that a borrower’s consent is critical to applying change in the floating rate of interest by banks or financial institutions.“Mere sending of letters to the borrower does not mean that the latter has given consent to continue his loan account with change in interest rate,” the bench of consumer court president Umesh V Jawalikar and members Kshitija Kulkarni and Sangita Deshmukh observed in a recent order. The banks/financial institutions are also bound to strictly adhere to Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines regarding change in rate of interest, it added.The consumer court directed City Financial Consumer Finance India Limited (now CitiCorp Finance India Limited) and Citi Bank NA to handover no-dues certificate and all documents received at the time of mortgage, to Kharadi resident Manik Khedkar and also pay him Rs45,000 towards compensation and cost of litigation.City Financial claimed in its written submission that it was unnecessarily made party to the proceedings, as the loan portfolio stood assigned to Citi Bank NA It claimed that the complainant was intimated about the takeover of his loan portfolio by Citi Bank NA and details of the new loan schedule was also conveyed by way of speed post.Citi Bank NA claimed that by signing the loan agreement, the complainant had accepted the clause relating to the right to assign loan and his negligence in understanding the terms and conditions of loan agreement precluded him from blaming the bank.The court, however, observed that the opposite parties (the two firms) did not produce on record any proof about the complainant’s consent in respect of a change in interest rate. Also, the RBI’s guidelines relating to application of change in interest were not followed, it observed. The court relied on two judgments by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in 2012 and 2017 with regards to adherence to RBI guidelines.“There are certain clauses in the loan agreement, which are apparently not in conformity with RBI guidelines and these clauses constitute an ‘unfair trade practice’ on the part of the opposite parties. Also, the agreement itself becomes voidable as certain provisions in it are against the law of the land,” the court held. It gave 45 days, from the date of order, to both the firms to comply with its directives.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74074810,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-438574,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/borrowers-consent-must-for-change-in-interest-rate-on-loan-consumer-court/articleshow/74071244.cms
48,['11/02/2020'],Union Bank posts Rs 575 crore profit in Q3,"This story is from February 11, 2020

(File photo)

MUMBAI: Union Bank of India has reported a net profit of Rs 575 crore for the quarter ended December 2019, nearly four times the Rs 153 crore it earned in the year-ago period.

Profits were higher on the back of lower provisions of Rs 1,570 crore towards NPAs during the quarter, down 72% from Rs 5,783 crore in the previous year. Overall provisions fell 64% to Rs 1,827 crore. Of the total provisions, Rs 2,260 crore was made toward a single large account in the housing finance sector, believed to be DHFL. Apart from that, the slippages were in keeping with trend, the bank’s MD & CEO Rajkiran Rai said.

The banks gross advances grew 5.9% to Rs 3.36 lakh crore. Deposits rose 10% year-on-year to Rs 4.45 lakh crore from Rs 4.02 lakh crore. The bank also reduced its home loan interest rates by up to 30 basis points (100 bps = 1 percentage point) from 8.2% to 7.9% for some categories.

“There is a steady improvement in operating efficiency. This quarter, we had good recoveries in Essar Steel, Ruchi Soya and Prayagraj. These three accounts brought in nearly Rs 2,000 crore. Recoveries and upgradations amounted to Rs 2,837 crore,” said Rai. He added the bank is looking at another Rs 3,000-crore recovery and upgradations during the current quarter.

Around Rs 1,500 crore recoveries are expected from large accounts in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), he said.

Rai said the bank expects good credit growth in the last quarter and the RBI’s term repo will bring down the lender’s cost of funds, which will be passed on to borrowers in the form of lower marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR). He said the interest rates on one-year deposits could come down by 25 bps in the one-year category.

50,['11/02/2020'],RJD seeks review of SC order on quota,"This story is from February 11, 2020

PATNA: The leader of opposition in the assembly, Tejashwi Yadav, on Monday demanded that the Centre either file a review petition against the Supreme Court’s ruling on reservations in government jobs and promotions, or pass a Constitution amendment bill in the current Parliament session and make such reservations a fundamental right.

The apex court on Friday had said that states were not bound to give reservations to scheduled castes (SCs), scheduled tribes (STs) or other backward castes in government jobs or quota in promotions.

“We are not going to stay quiet. This government talks of benefitting Hindus and I want to know whether Dalits or Backwards who have got reservation are Hindus or not? They are trying to do away with all kinds of reservation, but we will never let that happen. Their words differ from their work,” said Tejashwi, adding, his party would hold protests on the streets and Parliament.

Attacking the BJP government in Uttrakhand for advocating against the reservation in SC, Tejashwi said, “Their lawyers in the court had argued against reservation.”

He also took on LJP patron Ram Vilas Paswan and JD (U) chief Nitish Kumar for “helping in executing RSS agenda” and staying silent on the issue. “I want to know where is Ram Vilas is ji and Nitish ji now? Both are sitting quietly and instead helping RSS,” Tejashwi said.

Incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad also took to Twitter and said: “Why don’t those who talk about ending reservation talk about doing away with the caste system? It is because the caste system elevates them… I talk of doing away with the disease, but they talk of doing away with the treatment.”

Govt will resolve quota issue: JD(U): JD (U)’s Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh said in Lok Sabha on Monday that the government will resolve the issue relating to Supreme Court order on SC/ST Act amicably. “The Supreme Court order on February 7…The subject is highly sensitive. We are of the view that the entire House is of one opinion on this issue. When entire House is of one opinion and an order has come from the Supreme Court there should not be any politics on this matter.”

He added: “When the Supreme Court had given its judgment on SC/ ST Act, then an environment of doubt was being created in the country. But the government brought an amendment bill and proved its intentions. Hence, we believe that that government is capable of resolving this issue amicably.”

PATNA: Union bodies of Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited as well as its subsidiary companies on Monday called off their proposed 24-hour strike on February 11 and 12 after the intervention of Patna high court. They were to go on strike on a rumour that the power companies will be privatized.

Division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar on Monday asked the union bodies of the power companies and their office-bearers to exercise restraint from causing unprecedented plight to people of the state and immediately call off their strike or resume their work as soon as they could.

The direction was issued by the division bench while hearing a writ petition filed by one Sudhanshu Trivedi from Nalanda district. “The Unions may have their legitimate grievances in a democratic process, where role of law is the cornerstone of the Constitution of India. If any legitimate and expedient right or grievance is required to be redressed, the court is, therefore, the best forum apart from availing other alternatives, like conciliatory, mediatory and arbitrational actions,” the HC order stated.

The order further stated: “We are confident that the voice which we have raised and ventilated in this order will not be a cry in wilderness and reach to the ears of the leaders and they will resume the work, otherwise we shall have to consider stricter and sterner action after hearing the parties on February 11 at 2.15pm.”

The order was issued to BSPHCL and its union bodies including Power Engineering Services Association general secretary Surendra Kumar, Bihar State Electricity Supply Workers Union general secretary Chakradhar Prasad Singh, Junior Engineering Service Association general secretary Upendra Kumar Chaudhary, Bihar Bijli Majdoor Union general secretary Arjun Prasad and Bihar State Power Electricity Workers Union general secretary Dhirendra Kumar among others.

“We respect the court’s order and will fight for our rights under the jurisdiction of law. As the court has summoned us on February 11, we would put forth our grievances before the court,” Upendra told this newspaper.

“We need a written consent from the BSPHCL CMD Pratyaya Amrit that no privatization of power holding companies would take place. We don’t believe his words.”

Representative Image

KOLKATA: A 43-year-old executive of an IT firm from Survey Park has claimed that he lost close to Rs 1 lakh from his account after three fraudulent transactions took place in January and February, allegedly to buy expensive items from an online portal. While the main FIR was lodged at Survey Park police station, the bank fraud section has also begun a probe as a new modus operandi seems to have surfaced with the victim insisting he had never shared any banking detail with anyone.

“Avijit Saha of Harisadhan Patwary Road had received at least three OTPs on January 29. He had, however, not noticed them and insisted he never shared any banking details with anyone. He became aware of the transactions when he found three payments of Rs 59,400, Rs 30,000 and Rs 10,000 had been made from his bank account for purchases from a seller on Amazon. When he went to the Prince Anwar Shah Road branch of the bank, he was told to update his passbook. His fears of being robbed were confirmed and the officials asked him to approach the police,” said an officer.

“The complaint is against three transactions from the complainant’s account for which he did not share OTPs received through SMS either with his bank or with any unknown person. Thus, the accused persons cheated the complainant to the tune of Rs 99,400 by making wrongful loss to complainant and corresponding wrongful gain to themselves,” the FIR stated.

In another incident, Hemant Singh from Belgachhia was duped of Rs 50,000 in the name of playing an online game of cricket. Singh was induced by a caller who promised huge returns if he played an online game called Dream 11 that carries instant monetary prizes. “He was asked to invest Rs 50,000, after which the caller stopped contacting him,” said an officer.

Police sources said that the questioning of five persons from Jamtara and Dhanbad who were recently arrested for their role in multiple similar crimes in the city since 2019 has lent fresh insight into how these gangs operate.

“Most gang members — including the leader — have not passed Class X. All members use different modus operandi to dupe people online. But if one person gets good results with a particular modus operandi, the entire gang begins using it. Initially, all the money gets transferred into a central account — essentially a village development fund account — before being disbursed among multiple others within a short span of time. For example in an e-wallet fraud detected by cops, the money looted was distributed among 250 accounts,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma .

According to cops, when Chakraborty’s vehicle reached Suryanagar, the car hit a lamp post, overturned and fell into a lake. Locals helped the driver, Kalideo Prasad , and his assistant Ershad Alam to rescue Chakraborty from the vehicle. “He was taken to a local nursing home and transferred to Baruipur sub-divisional hospital, where he was declared brought dead,” an officer said.

Agriculture minister Ashis Banerjee mourned Chakraborty’s death. Speaking to TOI, Banerjee said, “He was an honest and hard working officer and a nice human being. It was because of his sincerity that we referred him for extension. His death is a loss for the department.”

Also, the weavers are expecting the cheaper import of fabrics from Vietnam and Bangladesh also to reduce after the government announced stringent check on imports under Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the revision of ‘rules of origin’ to protect domestic industry.

Chairman of Federation of Indian Art Silk Weaving Industry (FIASWI), Bharat Gandhi said, “The MMF sector was hit hard due to the cheap import of fabrics from China. However, the import from China has significantly reduced due to the virus outbreak. The orders for fabric has increased in Surat and this is likely to increase the production of fabrics by almost from 3 crore metres per day to more than 3.5 crore metres”

Surat’s MMF sector consumes about one lakh metric tonnes of yarn per month. The industry has an installed capacity of 7.5 lakh powerloom machines, which includes highly sophisticated water jet, rapier and air jet looms.

The import of fabric from China, Vietnam and Bangladesh into India has increased from 207 million metric tonnes in 2015-2016 to 1,300 MMT in 2018-19, which hurt the local industry badly.

Gandhi said, “China was dumping cheap silk, viscose, polyester and nylon fabrics worth Rs 200 crore per month. We expect the import of fabric to stop completely from China due to corona virus and the government’s move to curtail imports through FTA and rules of origin.”

n 2015-16 about 207 million metric tones of fabric was imported and it went up to 1,300 million metric tones in 2018-19

Dinesh Zaveri, secretary of the Surat Art Silk Cloth Manufacturers Association (SASCMA) said, “The fabrics manufactured in the city were uncompetitive against the cheap fabrics manufactured in China. The Chinese fabrics are cheaper by Rs 46 per square metre compared to the fabric manufactured in Surat and other places. The demand for domestic fabric has increased now.”

Ashish Gujarati, president of Pandesara Weavers Association said, “Majority of the powerloom weavers were operating at 70% of their production capacity. Now, the production capacity has been increased with the demand for local fabrics has gone up after the corona virus outbreak in China. It is a win-win situation for the fabric manufacturers”

59,['11/02/2020'],Magicbricks lets lenders improve home loan recovery,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Mumbai: Magicbricks is helping small lenders improve recoveries in home loans by providing an e-auction platform for foreclosed properties. Lakhs of such properties are expected to come to the market given that housing is turning out to be the largest loan segment for banks.

According to Magicbricks CEO Sudhir Pai , banks and sellers are looking to liquidate their repossessed assets through credible platforms. “This has opened up a window of opportunity for banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) to leverage Magicbricks for e-auction and recover some of their investments,” he said. Besides offering lenders an e-auction platform, which has certification by the government, Magicbricks also offers its retail reach. Magicbricks is part of the Times Group , which publishes this newspaper.

According to Care Ratings, the share of home loans to GDP has grown from 5.3% in 2004 to 9.1% in 2018. “The mortgage-to-GDP ratio for India is expected to grow significantly over the next few years as this is low, compared to other developing countries,” the report said. Outstanding home loans stood at Rs 12 lakh crore as of June 2019, according to TransUnion Cibil data. Assuming defaults of even 1%, the repossessed property market would stand at Rs 12,000 crore.

A host of lenders — including SBI , Indian Overseas Bank, Union Bank , Indian Bank , Saraswat Bank and UCO Bank — have used the platform to liquidate their re-possessed assets. Customers buying repossessed homes can also draw comfort from the fact that the banks have already done all the appraisal with respect to the property. “One must remember that all these properties have been put up by banks that have their own robust due diligence process. However, customers would be best advised that the properties put up for e-auction are on ‘as in, where in’ basis. This means that buyers should also avail the services of a lawyer to get the due diligence done,” said Pai.

“With more and more home buyers coming online and monthly traffic exceeding 20 million visits, we have become the automatic choice for all banks. In the last few years, e-auctions on Magicbricks have also improved retail reach and listings quality. It also offers a transparent process and educates customers while offering a level playing field through a transparent price discovery system,” he said.

60,['11/02/2020'],Three rounded up for murder of security guard in Vesu,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Surat: Umra police rounded up three persons on Monday in connection with the murder of a 35-year-old security guard in Vesu.

The body of Umakant Tiwari was dumped in an open plot behind Sarsana convention centre and the accused had poured acid on his face to make identification difficult. Tiwari, a security guard at Manira Garden apartment, had a fight with another guard Prem Singh over theft of mobile phone charge on February 4 at their common accommodation room. Singh hit him on the head with some blunt wooden object after which Tiwari collapsed. Singh left thinking that Tiwari would recover, but he returned the next day only to find him dead, police investigation revealed.

Meanwhile, when security supervisor Rajesh Pal came there, Singh described the incident to him. Fearing that he would have to face legal trouble, Pal planned to dump the body. Pal called his friend Sanjay Mishra, a scarp trader, for help and they wrapped the body and dumped it near the national highway 53 behind the convention centre. Later during the day, Pal and Singh went and poured acid on face of Tiwari.

On Monday, however, Pal approached police and described the details of the incident. ""Police have rounded up few suspects and they are being questioned. The deceased was murdered over a petty issue,"" said a police officer at Umra police station.

Police are questioning Singh Pal and Mishra for their alleged.

61,['11/02/2020'],DHFL shows risks faced by lenders: Axis Bank chief,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Axis Bank managing director & CEO Amitabh Chaudhry (File photo)

MUMBAI: Axis Bank managing director & CEO Amitabh Chaudhry , said the DHFL default has turned lenders risk-averse and that reforms are needed to generate funds required for the Rs 100-lakh-crore infrastructure projects planned by the government.

Delivering the A D Shroff memorial lecture on ‘Who will finance risk in India’, Chaudhry said that to achieve the government’s target of $5-trillion economy, the growth rate would have to more than double to 12%, while Axis Bank’s projection was that it would grow by less than 6% in the next fiscal.

According to Chaudhry, funding will have to come from entrepreneurs, banks, new financial institutions, foreign investors, insurance and pension funds. Highlighting the risks faced by lenders, Chaudhry gave the example of DHFL.

“Last year, the wholesale loan book was declared to be Rs 22,000 crore. By December, it became Rs 32,000 crore and the latest number is Rs 45,000 crore,” he said. Pointing out that the company’s bonds were trading at a 75% discount, he said this was a company that was publicly quoted, audited and rated by agencies.

“Please understand that A bank or anyone who deals with a company are relying on some systems to do their job. When you find the wholesale book has doubled in size and there are a hundred thousand fake accounts, the faith in the system gets shaken,” said Chaudhry. This then leads to banks stopping funds to companies like DHFL. According to Chaudhry, lenders are not in a position to take such large losses on an account where there is not much scope of recovery from DHFL’s wholesale loans.

Highlighting the need for investment-driven growth, Chaudhry said the current slowdown has manifested in several ways — consumer goods, cars, real estate, electricity.

While the country needed capital, there were challenges. These included, the ability to create jobs, technical challenges, the robustness of institutions, the availability of capital, and the linkage in various networks of economic value.

“We have political risks; cancellation of licences, large tax demands, abandonment of projects from previous regime. The manifestation of political risks shows up in the sanctity of contracts. Sudden and sharp changes not just from administration but also from judiciary can throw economic system into peril,” he said.

BENGALURU: Amazon India has moved the Karnataka high court, seeking a stay on a probe by the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The e-tailer has slammed the probe, terming it “perverse, arbitrary and untenable in law” as it prepares for a legal battle.While Amazon has requested the court to quash or set aside this probe by the CCI, the e-commerce major is seeking an interim stay, without which, the company said, it would see “irreparable loss” and the same will hurt its brand goodwill.On January 13, CCI had ordered an investigation into the operations of US-owned e-tailers like Amazon India and Flipkart (in which Walmart owns a 77% stake) for various trade practices, including deep discounts and favourable terms to select sellers. This was done following a complaint by the Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, a group representing small- and medium-sized businesses, against the two e-tailers who dominate the online retail market with an over 70% share.Legal experts said there was some strong language used by Amazon, which has invested $7 billion in India, against the competition regulator. “There is a strong prima facie case for a stay in favour of the petitioner (Amazon) as the impunged order has been passed without application in mind, the balance of inconvenience for the stay lies in favour of the petitioner…” Amazon said in its petition filed on Monday.The Amazon petition added that, while a stay order won’t impact CCI, it would affect Amazon if not granted. Interestingly, CCI’s order to probe Amazon came days before the US giant’s CEO Jeff Bezos landed in India last month, where he announced a fresh investment of $1 billion. Right after Bezos’s announcement, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal kicked up a row saying Amazon wasn’t “doing any favour” to India by investing as it was to cover up losses, even questioning how can a marketplace lose so much money.An Amazon India spokesperson said, “The matter is sub judice and hence we cannot offer any comments.” It is not clear if Flipkart is also likely to follow the same route. A Flipkart spokesperson did not immediately respond to TOI.A lawyer, who did not want to be named, pointed out a Bombay high court order in 2017 where the court had quashed a cartelisation probe against telecom companies like Airtel, Vodafone and Idea. The Supreme Court also later upheld the same order against the probe. “There is precedence in that sense. But it remains to be seen how this application moves,” this lawyer said. The matter is expected to be heard during this week.The complaint against Amazon and Flipkart has been in the making for a while as small traders have been complaining to the government over various practices by the e-tailer throughout 2019, which eventually led CCI to announce the probe. Prior to that, CCI had conducted a detailed study on the e-commerce market. Also, effective February last year, the government tightened the laws for FDI in e-commerce, which forced Amazon and Flipkart to make operational changes that affected their relations with certain sellers.Both Amazon and Flipkart officially maintain they are compliant with local laws but executives in these companies have been wary of frequent policy changes by the government, saying it hurts the growth of e-commerce here. In the Budget on February 1, the government announced a new withholding tax for e-commerce transactions, which would cause a liquidity squeeze for small and medium sellers. The e-tailers are seeking clarity and Amazon had said it was hoping for a simple and uniform tax regime in India.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74075385,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50225,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/amazon-india-slams-probe-by-cci-moves-hc-for-a-stay/articleshow/74071663.cms

Rajkot: Iraq is looking at Saurashtra’s commercial capital - Rajkot - to boost inward investments and create jobs in the war-ravaged country.

For the first time in since 2002, an 11-member delegation from Iraq consisting of businessmen and government officials will be participating in the annual international trade show organized by Saurashtra Vepar Udhyog Mahamandal (SUVM), an apex body of small industries of the region. The three-day trade show begins today.

The delegation visit is being coordinated by The State Company for Iraqi Fairs and Commercial Services, one of the Iraqi ministry of trade companies that aims to boost economic activity in the country.

“The participation in SUVM trade fair aims to expand the economic cooperation between Iraq and India in different fields, not just trade but also in industrial, technological and other fields,” Siddeq Shakir, deputy director, of the company’s exterior fair department told TOI in an e-mailed response.

“We are looking an investment in agriculture technologies, detergent making, packaging, handiwork in genuine leather industries, electronics and other sectors,” said Shakir.

Shakir said this is the first time after 2002, when it participated in a trade fair in New Delhi, that an Iraqi delegation is coming for a similar event in India.

Parag Tejura, president of SUVM, said, “Iraq has requirement of machine parts for its defence and Rajkot’s engineering industry has the potential to do business with them. They are keen on technical knowledge from Rajkot’s machine tools industry and we expect them to source various kind of machines and technology from here.”

Nearly 150 foreign delegates from various countries are participating in this seventh edition of SUVM trade show, said Tejura.

However, Bank of Baroda and Axis Trusteeship have sought intervention to protect their rights over Mercator’s subsidiary as its assets are pledged to them. The subsidiary owes more than Rs 200 crore to the two financial majors. NCLT will hear the matter on Wednesday.

On January 23, the NCLT had said that if Mercator fails to file a reply to ICICI’s insolvency application before February 10, then the matter will be adjudicated on merits.

The city-based shipping company’s woes came to the fore when it failed to pay salaries to its crew members last March. To pare liabilities, Mercator has been divesting its assets. Recently, it sold a 1999-built floating storage and offloading (FSV) ship, Prem Pride, for Rs 50 crore.

Mercator was acquired by Harishkumar Mittal in 1998. He owns about 20% in the publicly-listed company, but 73% of that stake was pledged as on December 31, 2019, regulatory filings showed. Mercator, which used to trade at Rs 57 on the stock exchanges in 2017, is now trending at less than Re 1, giving it a market capitalisation of Rs 25 crore.

During the first half of fiscal 2020, Mercator reported a loss of Rs 592 crore as against a loss of Rs 79 crore in the same period of fiscal 2019.

KOLKATA: Locals gheraoed Sinthi police station for several hours on Monday after a 53-year-old who was being questioned fell ill and died before he could be taken to a hospital. Police said a post-mortem will be conducted to ascertain the reasons for the death and, if necessary, a high-level probe will be ordered. A few locals tried to ransack the police station, and banged on the doors and threw benches and chairs around, but the matter was brought under control by late evening.

According to locals, an SI from Sinthi police had informed Raj Kumar Sau that he needed to come to the police station for questioning. Sau went to the police station with his son Ajay and brother Rajinder around 11.30am. The Sinthi police were investigating complaints of taps being stolen from apartments and three women had been questioned. One of them claimed they had sold the stolen taps to Sau, after which he was asked to come to the police station.

Ajay alleged that his father was assaulted in the police station, after which he fell ill. Cops said Sau had high blood sugar and complained of dizziness during questioning. Though Ajay claimed cops did not help take the ailing Sau to hospital, the officers said they had taken him to RG Kar Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Cops have registered an unnatural death case.

It was after this that locals gheraoed the police station. Jt CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar said, “The situation was brought under control. There was no ransacking or damage.”

KOLKATA: Though the diversions due to the demolition of Tallah Bridge are slowly becoming a habit for motorists, areas around it have been witnessing accidents, some of them fatal.

Two such accidents were reported from Canal West Road and Ultadanga Main Road in the past two days.

Around 7.25am on Monday, a bus on the Bagbazar-Garia route ran over a 58-year-old resident of Chandanpur in Titagarh on Ultadanga Main Road, close to the Ultadanga underpass. The accident happened when the victim, Loknath Ghosh , was trying to cross the road. He was taken to RG Kar Hospital where Ghosh was declared brought dead.

On Sunday evening, around 4pm, 48-year-old Md Nehal of MN Chatterjee Road lost his life after a bus on route 12A/B/C hit the bike he was riding pillion on. Nehal fell and was run over by the bus. His skull was crushed and he died at the spot. The rider, though, managed to escape unhurt. The incident took place on Canal West Road.

In both, a case of death due to rash and negligent driving was registered.

A few days ago, a 50-year-old resident of Narayanpur — Amar Das — fell while trying to board a moving bus on Canal West Road, under Tallah police station.

“At times, buses stop in the middle of the road, forcing cars to overtake from the left. This is the main reason for accidents on this stretch,” said a bus owner.

The fire at Taltala on Monday

KOLKATA: Fire broke out in a plywood godown-cum-shop in Taltala, off SN Banerjee Road , on Monday night. Though no loss of life was reported, 20 fire tenders were pressed into service as the warehouse is located in a densely populated neighbourhood opposite Taltala Bazar. Occupants of the residential building next to the shop had to be evacuated as the flames spread to their home.

Some workers of the warehouse sustained minor injuries while trying to escape after the fire started, but none of these were burn injuries.

According to locals, they noticed smoke billowing from the three-storey building on 8, Puran Chand Nahar Avenue around 8.30pm and immediately informed the fire brigade headquarters and the local police station. Fire fighters from Free School Street, which is barely two kilometres away, rushed in with nine fire tenders.

But as the flames kept spreading, more fire tenders were called in.

Pathologist Subir Dutta , who is in his 90s, and his octogenarian brother Samir Dutta , had to be rescued as the fire spread to their building next door. However, the firefighters managed to douse the flames, averting major damage.

Witnesses said workers in the warehouse managed to escape after the fire broke out, but since the building had inflammable stacks of plywood, it turned into an inferno in no time. “We are trying to ascertain if the unit had fire safety measures in place,” said state fire minster Sujit Bose who visited the spot.

It took firemen about two and a half hours to douse the blaze which, officials said, may have been caused by a short circuit from an electrical pump.

Madurai: Madurai corporation resolved the issue of sewage water deluging a residential area of Sastha Street in ward 29 of Pandian Nagar within a few hours on Monday, after a report published in TOI highlighted the plight of residents.

Syed Ahamed Basha, a resident, while thanking TOI said that a team of officials reached the spot early in the morning with an earthmover and started working. People in Sastha Nagar were much relieved as the work was completed in a few hours, he said. At least 50 houses in the residential locality were inundated by sewage water on Sunday morning due to a block in the channel which used to carry excess water from the sprawling Vandiyur tank to Vaigai river. It also restricted the movement of vehicles through the street as the sand pathway was cut down to drain sewage water.

Officials said that sewage enters the channel from Vandiyur and its surrounding areas where underground drainage facility is yet to be created. The water got blocked by garbage and it entered the low-lying residential area. An official from the engineering wing of Madurai corporation told TOI that sewage water got blocked due to garbage dumped by people residing alongside the channel. The trouble recurred every three months due to the dumping of materials including plastic bags. “Residents should cooperate with us by disposing garbage appropriately. Door-to-door waste collection is being done throughout the city. The issue will not resurface if they stop dumping waste in the channel,” he said.

Residents demanded that a retaining wall be constructed in the channel after removing the encroachment alongside it. Officials said that since the channel belongs to PWD, the onus is on its officials to find a longterm solution like construction of retaining wall.

NEW DELHI: The protest march to Parliament against CAA-NRC called by students of Jamia Millia Islamia on Monday turned chaotic when several of them tried to climb over the police barricades near Holy Family Hospital. While many were pushed back by police, a stamped-like situation caused injuries to some students. A few became unconscious and were sent to Ansari Health Centre on the university campus. An alumni claimed 30 students were brought to the health centre.

As misinformation about policy brutality spread, locals turned up at the protest site and continued to raise slogans till late despite pleas from police and the Jamia administration. Chanda Yadav, a student who was seen atop the barricade, was taken to the hospital after being pulled down by police.

Later in the evening, Jamia VC Najma Akhtar met the injured students at Al Shifa Hospital.

The “Chalo Parliament” march called by Jamia’s Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) started from gate number 7 around 1.30pm. The protesters were stopped near the Okhla main road intersection by police. When the students continued their march, they were stopped with the help of barricades near Holy Family Hospital. For the next two hours, students tried to climb the barricades and cross over, but were stopped. JCC claimed nine students were detained by police.

Around 3pm, Jamia proctor Waseem Ahmed Khan urged the students to go back to the campus. “You can continue with a peaceful protest at gate number 7, but don’t get into a tussle with police,” he told them. Jamia PRO Ahmed Azeem said, “The varsity officials are with the students to make sure no untoward incident takes place. We even asked the locals gathered there to disperse.”

Later, DCP (Southeast) RP Meena asked the students to move back as their protest had been heard. A case of obstructing a public servant from conducting his duty, assaulting a public servant and damage to public property has been registered against the students. “We detained a few students and later produced them before the proctor. There were no incidents of lathi charge or tear gas shelling, as alleged on social media,” said a Delhi Police spokesperson.

Thiruvananthapuram: CPI state council here, on Monday, passed a resolution urging the Union government to put an end to the alleged discriminatory attitude the Centre maintains towards Kerala.

“The Union government attitude towards Kerala is cruel. It continues to neglect the state, which is struggling to come out from the financial stress inflicted by natural calamities. Since the Centre-state relationship is not a master-slave relation, there is no justification for the abject neglect to Kerala,” the resolution said.

Centre refused to sanction any assistance to Kerala when a meeting chaired by home minister Amit Shah decided to allot Rs 5,908.54 crore to seven states for flood relief activities in 2019, the resolution said. “The Union government is yet to release its share of Rs 1,035 crore to be given to Kerala for paddy procurement. The cut in central share to coconut board, spices board, tea board and rubber board also affects the state’s agriculture sector,” the resolution said.

CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran, central control commission chairman Panniyan Raveendran, national executive member K E Ismael, assistant secretaries K Prakash Babu and Sathyam Mokeri participated in the meeting.

Parents form a human chain to protest against the management’s decision on Monday

PUNE: Parents of some students enrolled with the MIT Vishwashanti Gurukul School, Kothrud, protested inside the campus at 7am on Monday against the management’s decision to change affiliation from the state board to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) over fees hike fears.

The parents alleged that the decision was solely aimed at introducing massive hike in school fees from Rs 21,000-Rs 25,000 per student to Rs 60,000-Rs 70,000. “The schools intends to maintain the staff, infrastructure and just wants to switch affiliation to CBSE for the sole reason of increasing the fees,” Gajendra Patil, one of the protesting parents, said.

The parents said the school was affiliated to state board for 30 years.

School principal Madhuri Gokhale said the school had already received CBSE affiliation and the process was on for the last three years. “The parents were also informed about the decision at a meeting held last year and also through the parent-teacher association (PTA) committee,” she said.

Refuting Gokhale’s claims, Patil said almost 80% of the parents had opposed the decision, but the school management still went ahead with it. The parents now plan to hold a protest on the school premises on Tuesday and at the regional directorate of education at 11am on Wednesday.

Gokhale said the school received the CBSE affiliation in July 2019. “From April onwards, the school will adopt the CBSE syllabus for all the classes, while SSC board syllabus will be discontinued. There is opposition from a few parents, while a majority have no problem with the change in school affiliation to CBSE,” she said.

Gokhale said the CBSE affiliation was important for students to prepare for competitive examinations in higher classes. “All the other branches of the school are already CBSE affiliated,” she added.

80,['11/02/2020'],Guards keep a hawk eye to prevent garbage dumping at Marunji village,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Pimpri Chinchwad: Fed up with people dumping garbage on the road, Marunji gram panchayat, situated near Hinjewadi IT park, has deployed security guards to deter people from throwing trash in the open.

“There are five spots in the village where garbage dumping occurs. The panchayat has deployed three security guards - one each at Gaothan, Shindenagar and Sairung Samruddhi on HInjewadi-Kasarsai road. The guards do not allow residents to dump garbage. They also ask people to give segregated garbage to ghantagadis when they visit their locality. A daily review of the feedback from ghantagadi workers and security guards is taken,” sarpanch Poonam Buchade said.

Marunji village came under the limelight when Rajiv Gandhi IT park was set up here more than 20 years ago. The population of the village increased manifold in the past two decades with IT professionals those working in industries in Pimpri Chinchwad city setting up their homes here.

Instead of giving garbage to the ‘hatagadis’ operated by the gram panchayat, they prefer throwing garbage in the open along the road or open spaces. This prompted the gram panchayat to deploy security guards in areas prone to garbage dumping a fortnight back.

Buchade said the gram panchayat has deployed three ghantagadis who traverse various parts of the village collecting garbage from 6 am to 4 pm daily. There are around 3,000 houses and 300 shops in the village from whom we collect garbage. The panchayat has distributed two bins to the villagers around 1.5 months back for segregating the garbage at source. The ghantagadis collect wet and dry garbage separately. The daily garbage collection is around 3 to 4 tons. This garbage is taken away by contractor for processing and disposal.

“The garbage thrown along roadsides and open areas is a big menace. So, we have begun a public awareness drive through ghantagadi workers to stress the need for garbage segregation at source. They also collect feedbacks on the reason for throwing garbage in the open. As a result, we now receive segregated garbage from 80 to 90% of residents,” she said.

81,['11/02/2020'],Industry urges policy tweaks to buoy biz climate,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Jaipur: Industry bodies in the state made several recommendations to improve the business climate and encourage investment.

Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry president Suresh Agarwal drew attention to realign the e-way bill rules with other states where the exemption limit higher. “In Rajasthan, e-way bill is not required if goods for transport is up to Rs 50,000. The limit should be increased to Rs 1 lakh like many other states,” said Agarwal.

He also wanted to remove mandi tax on sugar and dal and reduce the overall rate from the current 1.6% to 0.5%.

Similarly, CII-Rajasthan urged the government to reduce land rates to make Rajasthan a lucrative investment destination. Currently, the government is selling land through auction which fetches better price and improves transparency even though the system runs the risk of losing investors.

CII-Rajasthan chairman Anand Sharma said the government should also bring down GST on khadi readymade clothes which attracts tax rates of 5% and 12%.

While appreciating the recent policy announcements by the state government, FICCI-Rajasthan said the next level is to promote these policies to the target audiences nationally and internationally to leverage the benefits.

N K Jain, member, FICCI Rajasthan State Council, said the crude oil refinery being constructed holds lots of potential. “There is a need to sensitise the industry about the business opportunities in petrochemical sector in western Rajasthan to realise the potential.”

Jain said around 81 varieties of minerals are available in the state and 57 minerals are produced on a commercial scale in the state. “There is a need to incentivize private sector participation and FDI in mineral exploration,” added Jain.

Major Demands

Raise e-way bill exempt limit to Rs 1 lakh like Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat and other states

Remove mandi tax sugar and dal, reduce rate to 0.5% from current 1.6%

Ensure sellers of goods pay GST not the buyers

Radar based study to assess the water table like in Maharashtra and Haryana

Madurai: The health department in Ramanathapuram district is fighting against unnecessary panic lingering among locals over the spread of novel coronavirus (nCoV) by creating awareness and educating about the virus, its spread and preventive measures.

“The disease has not spread to India but there is a general fear among locals here, who are panicking about nCoV at the very mention that someone is from China,” said a health official.

On February 8, a Chinese tourist in Rameswaram opted to return to China after locals panicked and alerted health officials.

Similarly, on February 2, rumours were spread about a 35-year-old man, who had returned from China, as suffering from nCoV and he was forced to be admitted to the nCoV isolation ward at Ramanathapuram government hospital and undergo a test. However, the result was negative.

The official said that even doctors and health officials are not taking chances with nCoV. Ramanathapuram has among the highest number of people being monitored under home quarantine for nCoV in the state.

“We are closely following up and checking, calling over phone and meeting them in person. So far, no one has any symptoms of illness,” said a senior health official.

Officials are now conducting awareness programmes in all schools and colleges in the district.

“Personal hygiene and washing hands is emphasized. We hope to spread the message to the children and their families that there is nothing to be afraid of and we need to stay away from those quarantined for a while,” said the official.

Meanwhile, Madurai district health officials said that for the past two days, no one has required screening at the Madurai airport.

“No one with a history of travel to China has crossed the airport for the past two days. There is a gradual decline in the number of such passengers,” said an official.

In Madurai, around 70 are being monitored under home quarantine for nCoV.

85,['11/02/2020'],"Telangana: 27,000 abortions in 3 years, some of them by quacks","This story is from February 11, 2020

Representative Image

HYDERABAD: Telangana saw 27,559 abortions (spontaneous and induced) in the more than three years since the fiscal year 2016-17, according to the Health Management Information System (HMIS) report. Experts estimated that at least half of these took place in single-room nursing homes and clinics on the city’s outskirts.

Meanwhile, the abortions reported in Telangana are only a fraction of the 45.2 lakh abortions that took place in the entire country during the same period (April 2016 to December 2019).

Replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha recently, minister of state for health and family welfare, Ashwini Kumar Choubey , said Telangana reported 6,481 abortions in 2016-2017, 7,862 in 2017-18, and 8,154 in 2018-2019. For the fiscal year 2019-20 the figure stood at 5,062 (till December 2019).

Worryingly, these figures do not include the number of abortions conducted illegally, which pose a huge challenge to the healthcare system.

Meanwhile, the National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-16) has pointed out that 46.6% abortions (across India) are conducted by non-doctors (including nurses, midwives, dai, family members, self or quacks) and 27.4% are done outside a medical facility (public and private), hinting at the gravity of the problem.

The reasons for increasing abortions include rise in unwanted pregnancies (largely due to lack of awareness on the use of contraception) and reluctance of doctors to do abortions at both government and private hospitals. As a result, many end up at illegal nursing homes and consult quacks. “In the city, pregnant teenagers mostly end up at the doorstep of quacks running single-room clinics,” said a task force member, who has been part of decoy operations.

Although, medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) is allowed (under certain circumstances) for any woman (married or unmarried) over 18 years of age, doctors often refuse to do it. “Most doctors refuse to do it due to ethical reasons as it is considered a sin. Also, an abortion pill has to come with a prescription, however doctors don’t write prescription due to social reasons,” said Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav , general secretary, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Hyderabad.

Yadav said that raising awareness about contraception and giving early knowledge on safe sex to children could prevent unwanted pregnancies.

“There were certain permissions given for exchange of land and My Home Constructions emerged as the ultimate beneficiary in the episode,” said Revanth Reddy, who sought a declaration to the effect that this land transfer is illegal.

Revanth Reddy was also seeking prosecution of the officials responsible for the transfer of land, which was done ‘contrary to the rules and existing laws’.

The bench headed by Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan gave the state four weeks to file its counter. TNN

88,['11/02/2020'],Communication is the key,"This story is from February 11, 2020

In the ensuing budget , the state does not have the desired resources to do all what people would like it to do. Hence, it is important for the government to communicate to people what it plans to do and how it will impact their lives.

First of all it must tell people that in the 150th year of Gandhi it will follow his talisman of looking for the face of the poorest woman in the state to check whether their decisions will benefit her. Secondly, the government must communicate to people in the following six areas, which are causing huge concern to people:

Job creation: How many jobs will be created in both the formal and non-formal sector by its budgetary exercise. Closer attention will need to be paid to rural non-farm sectors, so that urban migration is arrested.

Enabling environment: The business environment must be improved drastically hence the need to determine ease of running (not just doing) a business by cutting out red tape and unnecessary transaction costs. But business needs to respect workers’ rights so that they become good consumers.

Human capital: This concerns the whole population and covers education, health, nutrition etc. Mission mode must be adopted to address each of these areas and their sub areas. For example, in education, strengthening capacity of teachers at the panchayat level to enable good learning outcomes.

Addressing the drawbacks in the PPP projects on primary health care and why they have not succeeded. Address road safety deficit, which costs 3-4% of the state GDP, by doing awareness coupled with education of drivers, and expanding the traffic police strength. To ensure that children are able to get protein-rich food or supplements to enable their healthy growth.

Governance: To improve governance in all areas of administration by improving accountability mechanisms. Large number of maladministration cases by incompetent babus cause much of the setbacks to the good intents of the government. There is no disincentive for them to not do so.

Implementation audits: Large number of complaints come from people that the project or scheme is not being implemented properly. For example, the

Right to Education Act has not been able to meet its objectives of ensuring good education to poor kids. Similarly there are many schemes and policies of the government which should be reviewed through public participation.

State-federal relations: In light of the current political scenario in the country state-union relations are being strained in many ways which impact people directly and indirectly. Social instability is one major factor. But if one looks at the Constitution and its coverage of the topic, the state could draft its own education policy. It should do it. It can develop its own business promotion policy which would be an amalgam of industrial policy, trade policy and competition policy.

In conclusion that state must ensure a ‘whole-of-government’ approach in its implementation strategies. Working in silos, various branches of the government end up harming the good work being done by others.

Pimpri Chinchwad: A two-year-old male leopard died in an accident while crossing the Pune-Ahmednagar highway near Koregaon Bhima in Shirura taluka on Sunday morning.

This is the second leopard death in a road accident on Pune-Ahmednagar highway since January.

Manohar Mhasekar, the range forest officer (RFO) of Shirur, said, “A speeding vehicle hit the leopard when it was crossing the Pune-Ahmednagar highway at Vade Gaothan Phata near Koregaon Bhima. The police patrol informed the forest department about the accident, after which our team reached the spot.”

P A Kshirsagar, the round officer of Shikarapur, said, “The leopard had died before we reached the spot. The body was sent to Shirur for post-mortem and cremated later.”

Forest guard V M Chavan said, “The leopard was hit by a large four-wheeler, most probably a truck. The driver of the speeding vehicle tried to apply brakes after spotting the leopard, but in vain. We saw tyre marks stretching about 10 to 15 metres from the spot. The driver sped away with the vehicle after the accident.”

He said, “The leopard died because of severe internal injuries. The doctors told us after the post-mortem that the bones of one of its front legs was broken, while there was a fracture in the bone of the other front leg. There were no external injuries.”

Chavan said well-irrigated Shirur taluka was leopard-prone because of large-scale sugar cane plantation as Bhima river flows nearby.

“Earlier, a three- to four-year-old male leopard died while crossing the Pune-Ahmednagar highway at Borademala, about 5km before Shirur city, on the night of January 2”, Chavan said.

He also said two to three goats and sheep were killed in leopard attacks in and around Vadu village in Shirur taluka. “So, we installed a cage in the village on Saturday,” he added.

The authorities will soon take up road widening works to ease traffic congestion

SECUNDERABAD: The state government on Monday cleared a proposal for road widening from Lalapet nala to Ambedkar statue at Lalapet in Secunderabad to provide relief to people from traffic congestion on the existing road.

Deputy speaker T Padma Rao Goud on Monday disbursed cheques to the tune of nearly Rs 7 crore as compensation to landowners who lost their land as a result of the land acquisition.

Providing details of road widening works to be taken up, the deputy speaker said that the works would be taken up from Lalapet Flyover to Moula Ali Flyover, which stretches across 0.50 km, from Tukaramgate to Military Railway Track (0.50 km), Chilkalguda Junction to Sitaphalmandi X roads (1.454 km) and from Sitaphalmandi to Jamia Osmania (2.55 km) in Tarnaka division of Secunderabad constituency.

Around 140 property owners have agreed to give up their properties on the stretch for the road widening, said the deputy speaker. “The property owners have given up the land which is between 30 and 50 square yards for the road widening. At present, the road width is 73-foot and we plan to widen it to 100-foot. The works pertaining to land acquisition will begin next week,” said deputy commissioner, GHMC (North Zone), Ravi Kumar.

The GHMC said that the plan will ease traffic woes of several commuters coming from Moula Ali, Nacharam and adjoining areas and heading towards Secunderabad railway station and other parts of Hyderabad.

There, he told the cops he wanted to go to the washroom. He had escaped from an open window of the washroom.

CIA-III in-charge sub-inspector Yashpal said, “During questioning, Deepak told that after giving police the slip, he went to Dehradun. As he had no money, he returned to the city a day later. Thereafter, he hid in Sahnewal and Samrala. As he was keen to take shelter in Haridwar, he had to arrange money. Therefore, he went to his house on Sunday night and stole his mother’s gold jewellery.”

Police caught him while he was trying to flee to Haridwar.

“Deepak is a drug addict. He is facing trials in five snatching cases,” the sub-inspector added.

Varanasi: With the newly established Bone Marrow Transplant and Stem Cell Research Centre at Banaras Hindu University becoming functional, the city doctors successfully performed the first autologous bone marrow transplantation on a female patient with multiple myeloma (blood cancer) recently.

“I am glad to announce that the first autologous bone marrow transplantation has been successfully performed on a female patient at BMT-SRC by Dr Kailash Kumar Gupta and his team,” said the BHU vice-chancellor Prof Rakesh Bhatnagar while talking to reporters on Monday.

The 12-bedded BMT-SRC is equipped with the state-of-the-art facility having HEPA filtered air and modern equipment, said the BHU VC. The centre is equipped with the latest equipment for flow cytometry for patient care and research and X-ray-based blood irradiator, first of its kind in the country which is capable of irradiation of blood and its products. The centre also has three stem cell research labs.

The VC said that the first bone marrow transplantation was done under the guidance of Dr Rahul Bhargava from Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram. The centre aims at doing 50-60 bone marrow transplantations in a year, he said adding that the bone marrow transplantation in BHU costs one-tenth of any private hospital. The financial liability of the entire treatment has been met out from the Prime Minister’s fund, he said.

He further said that the autologous bone marrow transplantation is significant because in this process there is no need of a donor, rather the bone marrow of the patient is being used. “Hopefully we will be able to provide treatment to those ailments which presently do not have a cure, said the VC adding that every year around 20,000 bone marrow transplantations are required in the country out of which around 10% succeed. The BMT-SRC of BHU will not only prove to be a boon for the people of east UP region who have to go to Delhi, Mumbai, Madras and Vellore for advance medical treatment but it will also help the hospital in providing quality medical services for treatment of more complex diseases through hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, he added.

93,['11/02/2020'],Virus spreads good news for importers,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Ludhiana: Spread of coronavirus in China has set cash registers ringing of some importers, who are seeing a sudden spurt in their sales and orders of Chinese goods. Some of the most sought-after goods from China that are seeing a huge demand these days include fabrics like interlock, ponte, jacquard knit and footwears.

Businessmen say the situation is the outcome of fear psychosis among the end customers and manufacturers that imports from China may stop any time. Besides, there have been long delays, with production in China hit due to shutdowns caused by virus spread. The development is turning out to be a blessing in disguise for the importers, who had a dead stock of goods, which is now in demand. As per industry sources, rates of Chinese fabric and footwear are seeing a surge of 2% to 5% and are likely to climb further.

Speaking to the TOI, a leading importer of footwear in the region says, “After the spread of coronavirus in China, demand for footwear has doubled. Customers, who earlier used to take 15-20 days’ credit, are now making spot payments and also giving partial advance for new orders. This is happening because of the uncertainty about future of imports from China. Therefore, wholesalers want to stock adequate quantities to combat the situation that may arise if imports from China come to a complete halt. At present too, the movement of goods is very slow from China. We have hiked our rates marginally.”

The importer adds, “A problem that will become more serious in coming days is that we will not be able to visit China to physically check the samples of goods. In case of footwear, without checking the samples, it is not possible to place an order just by seeing pictures on WhatsApp or email.”

According to a fabric importer from Ludhiana, “This is a happy time for us as not only there is high sale of Chinese fabric, but the dead stock, too, has started selling. Due to the huge demand for fabric, the rates in market have increased by 5%. Another good thing is that people who were behindhand with payments are not only clearing the backlog, but also offering to purchase next order on cash. However, the problem will arise in case the fabric imports stop completely. Then, our business will be ruined.”

Local businessmen who are using Chinese fabrics are, however, unhappy.

Narinder Mittal, a garment manufacturer, says, “The coronavirus situation has given rise to confusion and there is panic in the market. As we do not know about the future of trade with China, we are ordering quantities more than required to keep the material in stock. This is increasing our investment without any concrete orders. If imports stop, we will be at the receiving end as similar fabric is not available in India even at higher rates.”

Bhushan Abbi, president of Knit and Fab Cluster, Ludhiana, says, “This is a serious situation and Indian government should give it a thought. Our dependence on Chinese goods has backfired. What if tomorrow relations between India and China get so strained that imports stop. Then India’s industry will be completely destroyed, as there will be no alternative of goods at same rates here.”

Local units to gain

The local manufacturers, particularly those of fabrics, are set to gain if imports from China come to a temporary halt. Due to the influx of Chinese fabrics, their businesses had taken a hit as demand for the local fabrics fell due to their high price and low quality as compared to the Chinese ones. Manufacturers of footwears, sanitary products, LED lights, among others, too, will benefit from it.

Kochi: In a rather interesting auction held at the St George Forane Church, Edappally, on Sunday, the highest bidder quoted a rate of Rs 3.05 lakh, the item sold — a white horse .

It was a horse donated to the church by a believer which was sold in the auction. In a video, which has now gone viral on social media, the white horse can be seen surrounded by parishioners as the auctioneer calls out the bids.

At Edapally church, it is a tradition to give poultry as offerings. “The tradition is called ‘nada iruthal’ and it is usually poultry, which are being offered. But this time, I guess for the first time, we got a horse,” said Anil Palathinkal, a church official.

According to sources, it was a faithful named Ukkan Devassy of Chalakudy and family who made the offering. The horse, about two-and-a-half-year old, was bought from Ooty by the family. The horse, sources said, was named Alfin Lydda, after the birthplace of St George.

Church officials said that a horse is a significant animal as it is connected with the legend of St George. As per the legend popular among Christians, St George, a soldier mounted on horseback, slew a fierce dragon to rescue a girl. The saint, mounted on a white horse and using a lance to kill the dragon, is one of the most venerated image in Christianity.

‘Kozhi nercha’ (offering poultry) is a popular ritual at Edapally church and the horse offering on the lines of ‘kozhi nercha’ was made two weeks ago. The believer who made the offering had even made the arrangements for taking care of the horse, till it got auctioned off. It was even provided medical care, said a source.

On Sunday, about four persons attended the auction which started with a base price of Rs 1 lakh. However, church sources said that there was some confusion about paying the quoted amount.

“It was auctioned off for over Rs 3 lakh but the one who had quoted the winning bid later expressed some concerns. We are trying to clear that, before finalizing the deal,” said Palathinkal.

Little did he know that his experience on the cruise will be a harrowing one. The Diamond Princess cruise ship was quarantined in Japan’s Yokohama on February 3, after the crew got to know that one of the passengers who disembarked the ship on January 25 was detected with coronavirus a few days later. Preliminary tests were conducted on all the 3,700 people on board and they were asked to remain in their cabins to prevent spread of the virus. So far, 135 people have tested positive and the Japanese authorities have now decided to properly screen all the suspected cases on board.Talking to TOI over phone, Piyush said, “From February 4 to February 8, I was isolated in my cabin. It was only on February 9 that I was allowed to go in for fresh air when I exercised and stretched my body to feel at ease. Different set of passengers are being allowed to go in the open on different days to prevent spread of infection. The ship is providing food, but after February 6, I have been avoiding all kinds of food being cooked here and eat only packed items. These include cup noodles, sterilized fruits, cornflakes etc. Being a vegetarian, my options are anyway limited. While the ship crew is helping us as much as they can, I am surprised that the Indian government has taken no steps to rescue the 138 Indians on board. The embassy just contacted me once and said there was little they could do. I raised the concern for more packed food items, to which, they said they would look into. I am yet to hear from them.”According to Piyush, passengers on the quarantined ship have also been provided with thermometers and told to monitor their body temperature from time to time, and report in case it exceeds the 37.5 degrees Celsius.Back at his home in Meerut's Shastri Nagar, his family is worried and praying for his safe return.Piyush’s father Mool Chand Sharma , a doctor, and his mother Sukhwant Sharma, a staff nurse, have been speaking to him throughout the day to check on his health parameters.Talking to TOI, Piyush’s uncle Pankaj Sharma said, “Nobody in the family is doing anything, except worrying about him.”Piyush, who works with a private company in Gurgaon, was to disembark the cruise on February 9 in Taiwan. However, he is now stranded on sea in Yokohama as the ship has been quarantined and the Japanese government has denied permission to the cruise to dock anywhere in the country.“We have been given hand sanitizers to keep ourselves clean at all times. I am just concerned that if no help comes from the Indian government in time, even those who are healthy will end up getting infected,” said Piyush.",meerut,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74076813,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50537,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/coronavirus-meerut-boy-aboard-quarantined-ship-in-japan-appeals-to-govt-for-help/articleshow/74070412.cms

HYDERABAD: The Telangana government will set up a film institute of international standards at Shamshabad soon. The revenue department has been asked to scout for suitable land near Shamshabad. Apart from this, it has been directed to look for land near Jubilee Hills and Nanakramguda for providing training and a culture centre for cine artistes and workers belonging to 24 crafts.

These decisions were taken at a meeting held on film industry development on Monday, which was chaired by cinematography ministers Talasani Srinivas Yadav and attended by actors Chiranjeevi and Akkineni Nagarjuna .

The minister assured the representatives of film industry that 10 acre land would be identified to allot houses for cine and television artistes on the lines of Chintrapuri colony. During the meeting, the film personalities expressed their concern over piracy and sought the help of the government to curb the menace as the produces were incurring losses. It was decided to implement online ticketing system soon to bring in transparency in ticket sale that would benefit both producers and film-goers as well.

“The film-goers will get rid of service charges with online ticketing. The government is ready to implement the system, but legal hitches were delaying it,” the minister said. He hoped the government would overcome these issues and implement online ticket system.

Both Chiranjeevi and Nagarjuna urged the government to issue identity cards to over 28,000 cine workers through Film Development Corporation , extend health insurance facility and introduce single window permissions for film shoots. They also asked the government to allow theatre managements to increase ticket rates during release of new movies. The minister directed FDC and ESI authorities to examine providing free health scheme for cine workers.

The minister assured them that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao would hold a meeting on issues pertaining to the film industry.

NAGPUR: The National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) has rejected MahaMetro ’s new design of Kamptee Road flyover as it would have endangered the lives of motorists.

MahaMetro had earlier decided to start the flyover ramp opposite SFS Cathedral. However, following strong opposition from locals it submitted a revised design extending the ramp to near LIC Square on the directions of Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari .

A technical team of NHAI, headed by senior officer Atul Kumar, had surveyed the spot about three weeks ago. NHAI rejected the revised design on the basis of Kumar’s report.

Kumar told TOI that extending the ramp to near LIC Square was dangerous. “As per the new design, the square will be very close to the flyover landing and speeding vehicles coming down the flyover can hit vehicles standing at the traffic signal. We have taken the decision after considering safety of all citizens,” he said.

Kumar further said that NHAI had made a concession to Metro by reducing the width of service road from 7.5 meter to 5.5 meter. “When Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) hands over extra land to us, we will widen the service road,” he added.

The NHAI official blasted Metro officials for submitting irrational proposals. “If they want to build unscientific structures, they should do it using their own money. The original proposal was sanctioned because it ensured safety of motorists,” he further said.

The revised ramp location was between VIMS Hospital and LIC Square. On possibility of starting the ramp between VIMS Hospital and SFS Cathedral, a Metro official said that it was not possible as it would block Mount Road. “We are planning to construct a subway opposite the church to offer safe passage to locals,” he added.

Meanwhile, Gadkari has directed officials of MahaMetro and NHAI to hold a meeting and have a relook at the Kamptee Road flyover plan. MahaMetro managing director Brijesh Dixit said a meeting would be held soon.

However, Kumar’s stand makes it clear that future talks will be fruitless as NHAI would hardly agree to a proposal that does not ensure safety of motorists.

Correspondence between MahaMetro and NHAI shows that the latter took very long to decide on the Kamptee Road flyover. Metro had sent a letter to NHAI informing them of its intention to revise the flyover design in February 2019. It then submitted the design in May 2019. NHAI team visited the spot in January 2020, eight months after the design was submitted. However, the letter rejecting the revised design was issued within a week of submission of Kumar’s report.

Strap: Car rams into timber-laden trolley, lone injured passenger is in critical condition

Meerut: In a major accident in UP’s Saharanpur district, four members of a Delhi-based family succumbed to injuries while returning from a wedding function in Saharanpur on Sunday night. The only injured survivor is currently in a critical state. Low visibility is said be one of the reasons behind the accident.

“The accident took place around 11 pm on Sunday when five members of a family - residents of Rani Bagh area in Delhi - was returning after attending a wedding function in Saharanpur when their car rammed into a tractor trolley laden with timber,” Saharanpur SSP Dinesh Kumar P said.

While four of the car’s occupants - Bhagwati Sharma (55), his wife Mamta Sharma (50) and their son Gaurav Sharma (28) and daughter-in-law Nidhi Sharma (26) - succumbed to injuries on the spot, 25-year-old Pradeep Sharma sustained grievous injuries and is currently under medical observation at district hospital in Saharanpur.

The incident occurred at Nangal area in Tapri. A rescue operation began after locals informed the police. Before all the five persons could be taken out of the mangled remains of the vehicle, four were already dead while the critically injured was rushed to the nearest hospital, a local cop said.

The exact cause of the accident is yet to be ascertained though witnesses claimed that low visibility on the stretch could be one of the factors. “Overloaded timber trolleys are a nuisance on the stretch. They usually commute at night to avoid police detection. The stretch is poorly lit with almost no street lamps,” a local said.

Picture used for representational purpose only

HYDERABAD: Trains operating under private-public partnership (PPP) in the South Central Railway (SCR) zone will soon be equipped with fireproof coaches, the South Central Railway (SCR) said on Monday.

“We have a fool-proof system to deal with fire mishaps. In long-distance trains, the fire extinguishers are set up in AC coaches and also with guards and the driver,” officials said, talking about the situation of fire safety in the trains of the SCR zone. The Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches which are replacing the traditional ones in the zone are expected to have improved safety features with fire retardant interiors and modern couplers with anti-climbing features, say officials. The specifications for such furnishing materials have also been reviewed by the Indian Railways in order to make sure that they are of optimum quality.

Railway unions, however, seem unhappy as the facilities are restricted to the private trains only. “The trains running here are hardly in accordance with fire safety rules. Also, passengers are worried whether these fire extinguishers available with the guards and loco driver will be accessible if there is a blaze in one of the general bogies,” said a member of South Central Railway Mazdur Union (SCRMU).

Meerut: Taking a swipe at All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader Asaduddin Owaisi’s recent remark on “not showing any documents”, BJP’s Sardhana MLA Sangeet Som has said, “Owaisi kagaz bhi dikhaenge aur joote bhi khaenge [He will show papers and will be beaten with shoes as well]”.

The BJP MLA also had a curt advice for the AIMIM chief. “I want to tell Owaisi, if you want to live in this country you will have to follow the Constitution and will have to show whatever documents government wants you to show. This kind of statement ‘will not show the papers, shoot us in the chest’ are of no use,” Som said on Monday. Som’s remarks came after Owaisi’s recent speech at an anti-CAA public gathering at Kurnoor in Andhra Pradesh, where the latter said, “We are ready to face bullets but won’t show any papers.”

The BJP MLA did not stop at that. He raked up the ‘burqa’ issue too. “Burqa is a symbol of male dominance and anarchy. It has no provision in Shariah and subjugates women to no end. In fact, our Constitution is in danger,” Som added.

The AIMIM chief had said, “Main watan me rahunga aur kagaz nahi dikhaonga. Kagaz agar dikhaane ki baat hogi to seena dikhaenge ke maaro goli. Maar dil pe goli kyonki dil mein Bharat ki mohabbat hai. [I will stay in the country and will not show papers. If asked to show papers, we will show our chests and ask them to shoot at us in the chest because there lies in my heart the love for India].”

Susheela

BENGALURU: Stabbed eight times by a helmet-clad intruder, a woman fought back. But when she pulled off his helmet, she was in for a shock: The attacker was her brother-in-law.

Susheela, 36, succumbed to stab wounds on Sunday after explaining to police the sequence of events: She said her brother-in-law attacked her because he was eyeing their ancestral property worth over Rs 10 crore. “Susheela put up a stiff resistance and identified her assailant. But the stab injuries proved to be fatal,” said a police officer. Based on her statement, Ananth Kumar, 42, was arrested on murder charges.

The attack occurred on February 7 at Honaganahatti village in Tavarekere, off Magadi Road. Susheela, whose husband Gangaraju died in a road accident 12 years ago, was living with her 14-year-old daughter and 75-year-old mother, Rudramma.

On Friday, her daughter had gone to school and Rudramma was sitting outside the house when a man walked in wearing a full-faced helmet and attacked Susheela with a knife. She defended herself with a stick used for making ragi balls and by throwing chilli powder at his face. But the attacker stabbed her on the hand, neck and head. He fled when Susheela identified him and raised an alarm. Neighbours rushed her to a hospital.

During questioning, Kumar reportedly confessed to the crime, saying he wanted to get rid of her as she was not agreeing to sell five acres of their ancestral property. Susheela’s nephew Kiran G told TOI: “The family owned six acres. Kumar sold one acre for Rs 50 lakh a few years ago after convincing Susheela. He, however, paid her only Rs 5 lakh. Lately, he was pestering Susheela to sell the remaining land as buyers were ready to pay Rs 2.5 crore per acre. But she was hesitating as she had been cheated by him earlier.”

Police are now examining the circumstances under which Gangaraju was killed. “We learnt the driver who had been arrested in connection with Gangaraju’s accident is currently working with Kumar,” said an officer.

104,['11/02/2020'],"MLA Ramesh still a German citizen, MHA informs HC","This story is from February 11, 2020

Representative Image

HYDERABAD: In a huge setback to TRS MLA from Vemulawada, Chennamaneni Ramesh , the Union home ministry on Monday informed the Telangana high court that he did not relinquish his German citizenship.

The Centre’s assertion assumes significance in the wake of the claims made by the MLA that he had given up his German citizenship.

Assistant Solicitor General Namavarapu Rajeswara Rao furnished to the court a note issued by the Union home ministry to this effect. The Centre, in its communication, informed that the MLA did not give up his German citizenship. Not only that, he went to Germany as recently as on December 16, 2019, from Chennai airport using his German passport, Rajeswara Rao said citing the contents of the note. It is evident that Ramesh held German nationality as on December 16, 2019, the Centre’s counsel said.

The controversy arose following a complaint by Congress leader Adi Srinivas, who was defeated by Ramesh in an election. The complaint said that Ramesh did not stay in India for the prescribed period before reacquiring Indian citizenship. The Centre held an inquiry and concluded that Ramesh misled the authorities in respect of his compulsory stay in India before applying for Indian Citizenship. It also suspended his Indian citizenship. Brushing aside Ramesh’s contentions that he is a sitting MLA, the Centre said that a legislator is supposed to display more integrity when his conduct was questioned.

Adi Srinivas’s counsel Ravi Kiran Rao has been contending that Ramesh’s claim of relinquishing his German citizenship is also a false one. “The Centre’s letter now proves that what I have been saying is correct and Ramesh has been playing fraud on the system and things are now slowly getting unfolded,” he said.

Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili, too, turned critical towards Ramesh’s counsel and sought an affidavit from him on the status of his German citizenship. “Whether he gave any letter to the German authorities, if so, what was their reaction to that etc. File an affidavit by February 24, the judge said and extended the stay on Centre’s suspension order that earlier nullified Ramesh’s Indian citizenship.

105,['11/02/2020'],"20 years on, family of baildar who went missing in 1995 still fighting for his pension","This story is from February 11, 2020

Ludhiana: A poor labourer family had to fight 20 years to get what is rightfully its – the family pension for son, a government employee, who went missing on duty in 1995. But even after two decades, they could only cross half the bridge – they are getting pension from 2017. Now, yet another battle is on to get the arrears beyond 2017, too.

On February 14, 1995, 24-year-old Sudagar Singh, son of Modan Singh of Toose village and a baildar in irrigation department in Doraha sub-division of Ludhiana district, never returned from work.

“We registered a missing report at Sudhar police station with the help of sarpanch. When he didn’t return home even after a year, we asked the department to take necessary action under law. Later, sub-divisional officer of Doraha marked an enquiry into the matter after which statement of villagers and department officials were recorded,” said 75-year-old Modan Singh.

Meanwhile, the irrigation department, “instead of granting family pension” after declaring him missing, as stated in the government rules 1991, 1992, 1996, terminated his services after two years without providing pension and economic benefit.

The family, with the help of an NGO Universal Human Rights Organisation (UHRO), started the legal action against the department in 2012.

“After scanning the case history and getting necessary details under RTI, we found that instead of declaring the missing person untraced, they had destroyed the record related to missing report. We sought record under RTI from finance and personal departments and then pleaded with the governor, chief minister of Punjab and irrigation department secretary that termination is wrong and family should get pension. However, the department refused to do so,” said Iqbal Singh Rasoolpur, general secretary of UHRO. “In 2015 we filed a petition before Punjab State Scheduled Caste Commission, which sought reply from irrigation department. And then arguments were held from both sides. After considering the evidence on the record, the commission in 2017 allowed benefits (arrears and family pension) as per 1991, 1992 and 1996 rules,” added Rasoolpur.

According to Rasoolpur, acting on the orders of the commission, Punjab government referred the case to accountant general Punjab for Family Pension in 2018. In December 2019, the family got arrears and family pension with effect from December 2017, he added.

“Instead of granting family pension to the victim family from February 1996, the government started it with effect from 2017. Now, we are bracing up for another legal battle,” said Rasoolpur. “We have sought disciplinary action against officials responsible for such delay as well as arrears from 1996 and its interest. We have written around 4,500 letters to various departments to get justice to the family. We will continue to fight till the family gets what its owed,” said Rasoolpur.

When contacted, irrigation department authorities said the family is getting pension from the day the court had ordered. “We are giving pension as per the court’s direction. If the family still has grievances, it can file a review petition,” said Jasinder Bhandari, canal department, Rupnagar division.

106,['11/02/2020'],Leopard scare casts shadow over kanwar yatra,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Bijnor: With Mahashivratri festival on February 21, forest authorities in Bijnor have issued an advisory to devotees who will be heading for Haridwar to collect water from the Ganga to move in groups and make a noise by playing songs on their mobile phones in view of numerous leopard attacks in the district. Since November 27, six people have been killed in leopard attacks and scores have been injured in Bijnor. Leopard sightings have increased manifold as cane harvesting is underway.

The authorities are in the process of setting up a special control room to monitor the kanwariayas. Lakhs of kanwariyas from neighbouring districts of Amroha, Sambhal, Moradabad, Rampur, Shahjahapur and Bareilly converge in Bijnor before heading for Haridwar. They embark on the journey days ahead of the festival on foot and and after collecting the holy water, return to their native places to offer it at their local Shiva temples on Mahashivratri day.

Plans are afoot to deploy drones for security of the devotees. At several places, route diversions will be put in place and additional forces will be deployed in Bijnor. The plans will come into force during the upcoming kanwar yatra.

The forest authorities have prepared a route map of the kanwariyas. Special vigil will be maintained in areas where leopard sightings were reported. The leopard task force equipped with a vehicle, cage, drone and nets will also patrol the area to deal with any untoward incident. The control room is being set up at the division forest office here.

The kanwariyas usually take short cuts like crossing canals, forest officials said. This is also the route where big cats have been spotted. Divisional forest officer M Semmaran said, “A large part of the route passes through forest areas. We will deploy our staff at such places. Forest teams will be active for 24 hours. As soon as we receive any tip-off about a big cat or any other wild animal on the route taken by the devotees, teams will reach the spot.

“We are making people aware about how to avoid big cat attacks. The leopard is a shy animal. It normally does not attack a human and certainly not, when they are moving in a group. We have suggested to all the devotees to keep a mobile phone, play music on it and shout slogans in forest areas as the noise scares the big cat away. Our teams will help the devotees.” Semmaran added.

Apart from leopards, rogue elephants also obstruct the way taken by the devotees.

Bijnor: Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad on Monday warned of a “massive” agitation if the Centre does not repeal the Citizenship (amendment) Act as he met the families of those killed and injured during the anti-CAA protests in Bijnor’s Nahtaur area.

“Our Constitution has given us the right to hold protests. Policemen had no right to fire at the protestors. If CAA is not repealed, we will launch a massive agitation,” Azad said.

He met the families of Suleman and Anas, who were shot dead during the anti-CAA protest on December 20. Later, the Bhim Army chief also went to the home of Omraj Saini in Kasmpur village to meet him. Saini sustained bullet injuries during the clash.

After the meeting, Azad said he would ensure that the victims get justice. “FIRs against erring policemen will be lodged on the order of court soon,” he said.

Later, addressing a press conference, Azad said, “People have rejected CAA and the government should repeal it. Otherwise, our outfit will launch a massive agitation across the country. BJP government is like Hitler’s regime which believes in bullet and not in talks.”

Earlier, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi and SP leaders had visited victims’ families.

Anti-CAA clashes had taken place in Bijnor city and several adjoining areas including Nagina, Nahtaur, Najibabad, Jalalabad, Chandpur and Sherkot on December 20. Police had registered 34 cases against 3,900 protestors in the district. Of them, 149 protesters were arrested and sent to jail.

Protesters were booked under various sections of IPC, including sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly).

Jodhpur: The high court has directed chief secretary, medical & health department, to conduct a survey of all government hospitals (district-level and above) and list obsolete equipment that were still being used.

The division bench comprising justice Sandeep Mehta and justice Vijay Bishnoi gave these directions while hearing a suo motu petition pertaining to deaths of 90 infants in Mahatma Gandhi Hospital in Banswara in 2017 and a petition pertaining to recent deaths of infants in Kota, Jodhpur and Bikaner hospitals. The petitions included one by Congress MLA Sanyam Lodha pointing to lack of infrastructure and medical and other staff in the hospitals.

The division bench has sought an action plan to replace these obsolete equipment with those with latest technology and directed the state government to consider creating a post for qualified hospital management specialists in district-level hospitals and higher centres in the state.

On bringing to the notice of the court by the amicus curie Kuldeep Vaishnav that the problem of blockage of sewerage discharge in Mahatma Gandhi Hospital, Jodhpur, had not been resolved, the court issued notices to the commissioner (Jodhpur Municipal Corporation) and the chief engineer (PWD).

Vaishnav argued that because of unattended sewerage issue, there was threat of bacterial infection in the hospital.

The court directed that immediate steps be taken to ensure that proper sewerage facility is set up in Mahatma Gandhi Hospital by the next date of hearing on March 19.

Before this, the amicus curie submitted a report of the visit of government hospital in compliance of the direction of the court on last hearing on January 7.

AAG Pankaj Sharma also submitted a report on the number of children who died in the state hospitals in December.

HYDERABAD: In a major move, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) has decided to take over the operation and maintenance of sewer network in GHMC peripheral circles from GHMC from March 1.

At a joint meeting held at HMWS&SB main office on Monday, HMWS&SB managing director M Dana Kishore and GHMC commissioner D S Lokesh Kumar along with other officials, discussed the process of the takeover.

According to a water board official, the move comes after Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MA&UD) minister K T Rama Rao directed the HMWS&SB to take over the responsibility of handling the sewer network in peripheral circles of GHMC.

The existing sewer network covers 66 municipal wards spread over a length of 3,600 km and has 3,26,354 manholes.

113,['11/02/2020'],"Despite ban, commercial vehicles ply in Old City","This story is from February 11, 2020

Ludhiana: Even as commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal renewed the orders banning commercial vehicles in Old City between 5am and 11pm on February 7, the ground reality presents a different picture.

A TOI team visited several areas of Old City and found commercial vehicles, including trucks and load carriers, plying in Chaura Bazaar, Mata Rani Chowk, Kesar Gunj Mandi, Trunk Bazaar, Transport Nagar, Chauri Sadak and Clock Tower between 3pm and 4pm.

Residents blame lack of will for the failed enforcement.

Rajan Kapoor, 42, a resident of Taj Gunj, said, “Commercial vehicles can be seen on Old City roads 24x7. The police stations concerned have failed to put the directions into action.”

Raj Kumar Sharma, 63, a resident of Gaushala Road, said, “The ban was implemented only for the first few days. Now, heavy vehicles are back on narrow, congested lanes of Old City. Cops challan other traffic rule violators, but do not check these vehicles.”

Rivesh Mahindru, 35, a hosiery manufacturer from Madhopuri, said, “Ludhiana police issue one after the other order, but fails to ensure their execution. Recently, several orders were issued like restricting timings of restaurants; ban on songs glorifying weapons, violence, liquor and drugs; curb on the movement of heavy vehicles in Old City and no encroachments on roads. Except the anti-encroachment drive, no other direction has been realised with an iron hand.”

On December 4, 2019, a load carrier had run over a 6-year-old boy, Harshit Kaushal, on Gokul Road. The accident had triggered protests, with residents seeking a ban on the entry of commercial vehicles in the area. The locals had not even let the area transporters open their shops for two days. After forming a committee to look into the issue, the police, on December 13, 2019, had imposed a ban on commercial vehicles in Old City between 5pm and 11pm. Following the issuance of orders, the transporters had hit the roads to protest against it. After a delegation of transporters met the police, the timings were changed — small and medium commercial vehicles were allowed in Old City between 8am and 10am and from 2pm to 4pm and the heavy ones from 11pm to 5am.

However on February 7, Agarwal issued fresh orders banning all commercial vehicles between 5am and 11pm.

When asked about the 5am-11pm orders, additional deputy commissioner of police (Zone-1) Gurpreet Singh Sikand said, “There must be some mistake. Small vehicles that carry weight up to 1 tonne can ply from 7am to 9am and 1pm to 2pm.”

On heavy vehicles entering the area during restricted hours, he said, “It should be brought to the notice of cops.”

Fresh orders

On February 7, the Ludhiana Police had renewed the ban orders and restricted entry of commercial vehicles in Old City between 5am and 11pm. Orders issued under Section 144 of the CrPC have to be renewed after every two months

Meerut: The state government has terminated the services of a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) who was accused of orchestrating the murder of his wife’s alleged lover.

The DSP, who was posted at Meerut-based Police Training School, was axed “for not discharging his duties”. He was under suspension after an FIR was filed against him for the murder.

The chief minister’s office said in a tweet, “UP CM Yogi Adityanath’s zero-tolerance on corruption continues. The CM has directed the termination of suspended Deputy SP at Meerut Police Training School for not discharging his duties as per the protocol.”

According to police sources, the accused’s wife was having an illicit affair with a Moradabad-based man who was working as a clerk in the railway department. After the accused got the whiff of it, he and his nephew hired contract killers who shot the man dead on February 1, 2017, near railway crossing which is close to Majhola area.

Later, an FIR was filed by the government railway police. Within days, the two contract killers were arrested, but the main accused and his nephew remained absconded, only to surrender after the police pressure.

A delegation of local right wing group created ruckus at school where the teacher taught to pressurise school ... Read More

MEERUT: Over 20 days after a woman teacher from Saharanpur made anti-CAA remarks during her visit to Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh , a group led by local saffron leaders held a protest at her private school on Monday forcing the authorities to suspend the 40-year-old educator. Another teacher who was with Nahid Zaidi is also facing a probe for her remarks.

However, the “pressure tactics” and the school administration’s decision didn’t go down well with district police.

Saharanpur superintendent of police (city) Vineet Bhatnagar , said, “Locals and activists from a certain group identified the teachers from a viral video and used pressure tactics against school authorities. It is improper behaviour.

“The veracity of the video is yet to be verified, and the remark is inflammatory or not is yet to be established. Strict action will be taken if anyone tries to rake up the issue and create law and order problem. If anyone has objection, he/she can take legal recourse but any step or attempts to pressure school or individual will be dealt strictly as per law,” he said.

Following the ruckus by the group, the school authorities suspended Zaidi.

Divya Jain, principal of the school, said, “The teacher has been suspended. Further action will be taken based on procedure and guidelines laid down by the education department. She had gone there (Shaheen Bagh) on a Sunday and school had no prior intimation about it.”

A video of Zaidi, speaking to local media in Delhi, was shared widely. Another teacher from a different school, who was with Zaidi, has also been put on notice.

The group, which held the protest at the school, demanded Zaidi be sacked for her alleged inflammatory remarks during her visit to protest site in Shaheen Bagh where hundreds of women have been agitating against Citizenship Amendment (CAA) Act and national register of citizen (NRC).

“I keep on going to Delhi. On January 19, I accompanied a group to Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh. We went there out of sheer curiosity. Local media there started asking questions. The video in question was edited to focus on the negative things while all positive aspects were cropped. I have given my life in teaching profession and I meant no harm to anyone’s religious sentiments,” Zaidi said.

The mobilisation had begun on social media when a few locals identified the teachers and began demanding strict action.

“The video was widely shared on social media. A roadmap was drawn and we reached out to locals and parents of wards studying in the school and we finally decided to meet at around 11am on Monday on Court Road. From there, we went to schools where we spoke to the principal,” Rahul Jhamb, a local activist, said.

Meerut: With the death of one more person on Monday, the toll due to swine flu has risen to two in Meerut district. So far, as many as 17 patients have been diagnosed with H1N1 virus, three more than what was reported on Sunday.

According to health department sources, a 50-year-old man in Panchsheel colony died on Monday while a 60-year-old woman, a resident of Kishanpura, succumbed to the virus on January 3.

“So far, 17 cases of swine flu have been reported in Meerut. Two deaths have also been reported. The health department is on its toes and is spreading awareness about the disease. We urge people to maintain cleanliness so that the infection doesn’t spread as easily,” said Rachna Tandon, Meerut district epidemiologist.

Meanwhile, private hospitals have been asked to set up isolation wards for patients suffering from swine flu to ensure that other patients or hospital staff are not infected.

In areas where swine flu cases have been detected, surveillance is being conducted to check if there are more cases in proximity. Awareness camps are also being organized there so that people in those areas can exercise caution. Also, epidemiological study and travel history of patients is being checked, the health department authorities said.

In 2019, a total of 399 cases of swine flu were reported in contrast to 24 cases in 2018.

According to doctors, the period between January and March is considered the “peak time” for the disease caused by H1N1 virus. The main symptoms are fever, cough, runny nose, bodyache and headache. In case of shortness of breath or vomiting, the patient must contact the doctor.

117,['11/02/2020'],CU to halve overseas distance education fees,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Kozhikode: Calicut University will slash the fees charged for overseas students registered under the school of distance education (SDE) by half to attract more students under the distance education mode.

The meeting of the syndicate standing committee on distance education made the recommendation to the syndicate after finding that the fees charged by the varsity was higher when compared to other universities.

“We have decided to recommend cutting the existing fees for overseas students registered under SDE by half. The recommendation has been made as the existing fee charged in US dollars was affecting the enrolments of foreign students,” syndicate member Ugin Morely said.

Currently, the varsity is charging $225 as registration fee from overseas students apart from $70 as tuition fee per semester and special fee of $75.

Morely said that the syndicate standing committee has recommended reducing the registration fee to $130 and the tuition fee and special fee to $35 and $40, respectively.

Morely said that there has been a decrease in the number of overseas students registered under SDE over the last few years.

The university had to shut down 24 overseas centres which offered distance education courses in the Gulf following a Kerala high court order in December 2014.tnn

118,['11/02/2020'],Mahapanchayat gives 2 days to cops to solve farmer’s murder at toll plaza,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Meerut: A mahapanchayat convened at Dulhera village on Monday unanimously decided to give 48 hours to police to solve the murder of a local farmer, Sohanveer Chauhan (30), who was allegedly killed by bouncers at Daurala toll plaza on February 3.

Hundreds gathered at the mahapanchayat called by Samajwadi Party leader Atul Pradhan to brainstorm on the further course of action in the brutal murder of Sohanveer.

“A delegation of police and administration, including local MLA Sangeet Som, came over on Sunday evening requesting a week to solve the case and also defer plans of convening the mahapanchayat. But we stuck to our plan and held the mahapanchayat on Monday. It was decided to give two days to police to solve the case and arrest the real culprits or else we will begin an indefinite strike at the commissioner’s office from Thursday,” said Ravindra Chauhan, 42, elder brother of the deceased.

Sohanveer was killed on February 3 when he and Ravindra were returning home from the fields on a tractor laden with cane. “There was a long queue in the cash lane and we decided to take the FASTag lane. This did not go down well with the plaza employees who initially confronted us. The argument soon turned into a brawl and bouncers at the toll plaza began thrashing my brother with rods, lathis and other weapons,” Ravindra had said.

Despite efforts by toll plaza employees to portray the murder as an accident, evidence and post-mortem report paint a completely different picture. The post-mortem report of the victim has also corroborated claims of torture before death. According to the report, the victim sustained 10 injuries on his body with fractures and ruptures in the internal organs at five places. It read, “The cause of death is shock and hemorrhage as a result of ante-mortem injuries following blunt force trauma.”

The victim’s family members claimed that the toll plaza staff tried to portray the incident as an accident and not murder. Ravindra claimed, “The toll plaza staff have been giving different statements every time and are trying to destroy evidence. When I returned to the spot, I saw the tractor abandoned near a 11KV power line. The staff told police that my brother was electrocuted. Later, they claimed that my brother lost control of the tractor due to which it turned turtle, resulting in his death. They have been making this up despite the fact that I was present at the spot with him.”

Police have also conceded that six minutes of the footage from CCTV DVR was erased -- which also points at destruction of evidence to cover up tracks. “We have sent the CCTV DVR for forensics examination. If the report also corroborates claims of tampering with footage, additional sections of destruction of evidence will be added to the existing FIR,” said Akhilesh Narayan Singh, Meerut SP (City).

Though two accused have been arrested after filing of a case of murder, family of the deceased has alleged a cover-up by police to protect the actual culprits. “As of now, we have arrested two persons who were on duty in the particular lane where the incident happened, We are yet to ascertain the complicity of others, based on which further arrests will be made,” the SP said.

Aurangabad: In the wake of the forthcoming Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) elections, state minister Sandeepan Bhumre, Aurangabad West MLA Sanjay Shirsat and former Sena MP Chandrakant Khaire on Monday held the groundbreaking ceremony of development works in Satara and Deolai worth Rs 5 crore.

The locals have been demanding a separate municipal body as the civic body had failed to initiate development in the area. The works are being undertaken through the funds approved by the district planning committee (DPC) for the development of the areas. Monday saw the inauguration of 8 road construction works.

In December, the corporators of Satara and Deolai had tendered their resignations from corporatorship seeking the NOC of the AMC so that a separate municipal council can be created for Satara and Deolai as AMC failed in providing any development for the area.

According to residents, the inauguration of works done on Monday does not bring any relief as the works are unlikely to finish before elections. Meanwhile, MLA Sanjay Shirsat in his speech stated that all the 8 works will be finished within a month’s time.

120,['11/02/2020'],Consumer court pulls up NBFC over truck seizure,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Vadodara: A Navi Mumbai-based non-banking finance company (NBFC) has drawn the ire of consumer court for dishonouring its earlier order.

On February 7, the court had asked WitFin, which has a local office in Alkapuri, to immediately release a truck owned by a resident of Ajwa Road, which it had seized despite the owner paying the defaulted loan amount. However, the finance company did not release the truck and demanded parking charges from the borrower Paresh Rathod. The court ordered WitFin to immediately release Rathod’s truck without demanding any further amount.

Rathod had borrowed Rs 6.2 lakh in February 2017 to purchase a used truck and was supposed to pay Rs 20,228 every month as instalment. Rathod regularly paid till September last year but defaulted two instalments. Following the default, the company’s executives stopped Rathod’s driver near Dumad crossroads and seized the truck forcibly. They asked Rathod to pay Rs 1.1 lakh to get the truck back.

Two months later, Rathod borrowed the money and went to the company’s office but he was informed that he will have to repay the remaining loan amount of Rs 4.1 lakh by November 30. Meanwhile, Rathod filed a complaint with consumer court as the seizure of the truck was illegal.

Rathod then sold the truck to one Imtiyaz Sheikh as he was in dire need of money. Sheikh even paid Rs 4.2 lakh to the finance company yet the truck was not released as the finance company that the complaint in the consumer court. Rathod withdrew the complaint, but the truck was not released following which, both Rathod and Sheikh filed another complaint in the district consumer forum.

In an interim order, the court asked WitFin to hand back the truck but the company asked for Rs 16,400 parking charges of a godown where the truck was kept.

“We filed a contempt application as WitFin did not release the truck. The court came down heavily on the company and directed it to return the truck without charging any money,” said P V Moorjani, through whom Rathod had approached the consumer forum.

NEW DELHI: The body of a four-year-old boy missing for the past four days was found dumped in a drain at Karawal Nagar on Monday. The child ’s parents had even lodged a kidnapping complaint on Saturday, alleging foul play behind his disappearance. Police are probing into the possibility of a sexual assault as well.

Police sources said that prima facie it appears that the child died after drowning in the drain water. However, his family has demanded a thorough probe into the death, claiming that he might have been lured out of his house by someone and then thrown into the drain. The family blocked the Khajuri main road on Monday, demanding action.

Police said that the child stayed with his parents at a rented house in Karawal Nagar. The family told the cops that the boy had stepped out of house to see an election rally on February 6 and had started walking behind the procession before he disappeared. The family looked for him in the locality till late before lodging a police complaint.

The family claimed that they had even checked the drain but found nothing. The kin also alleged inaction by police into looking for the child and claimed timely action would have saved him.

On Monday morning, a local spotted the decomposing body in the drain and informed the police, who sent it for an autopsy. Doctors have collected viscera samples from the child’s body and will send them for forensic analysis to determine whether he was assaulted before he drowned.

An inquest has been initiated into the death. The possibility of an accident has also not been ruled out. The cops suspect that the boy might have lost his balance while walking with the crowd and slipped into the deep drain. However, locals say that no one had heard him call for help.

123,['11/02/2020'],"The buck stops with the traffic police, or does it?","This story is from February 11, 2020

Chennai: Last year, after the Madras high court came down heavily on the traffic police for poor enforcement of the helmet rule, the number of fatal accidents among two-wheelers fell. The number of deaths among riders not wearing helmets came down from 72% in 2018 to 54 in 2019.

“That was the effect for just one offence,” said M Kasimayan, a Chennai-based traffic activist. “Courts can’t speak about traffic violation and road safety every day, but if policemen do their job there won’t be these many violations and accidents. Sadly, many accident hotspots don’t have police during peak hours because they are posted on bandobast duty or as line up for VIP convoys,” he said.

According to the city traffic police, nearly one-fourth of their strength is stationed at signals and the rest are deployed at intersections in shifts. But if there are no police at signals or at intersections, it is also because more than 2,000 of the 7,800 sanctioned posts are vacant. “Add to this people who go on leave or have a weekly off,” said a traffic policeman at Madhavaram. “We work for 12 hours a day to make up for vacancies. Standing there and managing traffic is a challenge. There is no time to book people for violation ,” he said.

Activists like S Suresh from Federation of Ambattur Residents Welfare Association, who has been campaigning for better policing for years, call for use of technology. Mumbai can make entire penalty system online to track repeat offenders. The CCTV camera footages can help police catch offenders. The challans can be posted to their houses. All we need is some investment in smart technology, he said.

The city police have installed 25,000 CCTV cameras in the last one year, but the department hasn’t upgraded itself to technology. “We don’t know how many of these cameras are working,” said activist Kasimayan. “Traffic police claim they have make apps for making complaints, receiving e-challans and paying fines. But not many people are using them because they are not aware,” he said.

The problem exists even at signals. There are 408 traffic signals in the city. The signals are first-gen pre-timed signals which don’t consider real-time traffic data. “This means the signals will not change even if there are no oncoming vehicles. This will lead to more violations and accidents eventually,” said a traffic expert who works with the Union IT ministry.

Many senior policemen are pushing for reforms, resources and innovations. “Many countries have equipped their police forces with high-end equipment long ago. It’s time for Tamil Nadu to do so,” said former DGP S R Jangid.

Goyal also wrote that Chhattisgarh cabinet had decided to amend the Panchayati Raj Act and nominate disabled persons as councillors in every gram panchayat. He further stated that around 40 lakh persons with disability and 16 lakh families will benefit by this move.

Goyal also raised this issue with chief minister Ashok Gehlot during the pre-budget dialogue with NGOs, civil societies and consumer forum. He also raised the issue pertaining to giving status of BPL category to the families of PwDs.

Earlier, the court of the commissioner for specially abled persons had directed local self government (LSG) department and the rural development and panchayati raj department to nominate one PwD as member/councillor in every panchayati raj institution and urban local body.

Kochi: Suchitwa Mission along with Haritha Keralam Mission would soon undertake a district-level auditing of green protocol in government offices in the state and rank them based on their fidelity.

Adherence to green protocol became a norm from June 5, 2018 but this is for the first time that state is undertaking an evaluation of the protocol introduced to minimize waste generation in government offices and make employees accountable.

“In October 2019, a taskforce had drafted criteria for green protocol monitoring on the basis of which guidelines have been formed. This has now been sent for government approval,” said consultant for solid waste management, Haritha Keralam Mission, Jagjeevan.

Once they get the approval, which is a formality, a joint panel of Suchitwa Mission and Haritha Keralam Mission would audit the efficacy of green protocol and issue certification.

“This would be carried out on the basis of questionnaire,” said an official with Suchitwa Mission.

According to officials, lot of positive changes have taken place in government offices since the green protocol was adopted. “Till now, for public programmes green protocol implementation was based on exertion of social pressure. But now government is planning to make this mandatory,” said Jagjeevan.

According to officials, this would be easier now since the government has banned single-use disposables.

The primary focus is on waste minimization through prevention of use of disposables and use of reusable alternatives. Any waste generated has to be treated in the most scientific and environment-friendly manner.

As per protocol, organic waste should either be composted in office premise or given for community composting or other treatment facilities. Waste generation on account of disposables in minimized to zero-waste level by using reusable plates and glass or steel tumblers. To minimize waste on account of decorations, no disposable product should be used. As per the guidelines, paper waste should be recycled and the e-waste generated is to be sent to Clean Kerala Company.

Aurangabad: The representatives of farmer bodies took out a protest rally to the Beed collectorate on Monday to receive relief against the damage they suffered due to excessive October rain.

In a memorandum of demand submitted to the Beed district collector’s office, the Maharashtra Rajya Kisan Sabha, Beed stated that after six years of drought-like situation, the district faced heavy rain in the last season causing heavy loss of kharif crops. The farmer body’s district president Mohan Lamb stated that the help announced by the state government towards compensation against crop loss is far from satisfactory. However, many farmers in Beed have not even received the compensation announced.

Earlier, the central team had conducted a survey to assess damage to kharif crop and announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh.

On the other hand, Maharashtra Rajya Kisan Sabha, Beed district committee secretary Murlidhar Nagargoje claimed that none of the farmers in the Beed district have received grants under the state government’s horticulture area scheme.

The protestors highlighted that the various terms and conditions placed for loan waiver announced by the state government goes against the Shiv Sena’s election manifesto in which they promised to clear the 7/12 extract that is to make the farmer free of loans. “The Sena-led the government should remove the limit of Rs 2 lakh. Many farmers have borrowed loans for the purpose of irrigation, drip system or poultry farming. These loans are purely for agriculture purposes and should be covered under the state government’s loan waiver,” Nagargoje said.

In addition, the demand was made to also cover the farmers deprived of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Yojana. The farmers said that addressing these pressing issues would prevent farmers from taking the step of suicide.

Maharashtra Rajya Kisan Sabha members stated that despite having necessary documents around 1.05 lakh farmers of Beed are still waiting for crop insurance of 2018.

The delegation met with the resident district collector and presented their demands.

The official said meetings of different departments will be held with the district collector so as to look into their demands.

Chennai: When the TNSTC bus he travelled in met with an accident, it cost a 28-year-old engineer his limb, a salary cut and left him with a huge debt.

“It was a day that changed my life,” said Nagoor Meeran.

On February 10, 2019, Meeran boarded the bus to his native Polur in Tiruvannamalai district. When the bus crossed Vandavasi, it met with an accident. The driver was unable to control the vehicle while negotiating a curve and hit boulder. In the accident, Meeran’s leg was crushed. “The pain was severe. I could see blood pouring out of my leg,” he said.

He was first taken to a government medical college hospital in Chengalpet but his family members wanted to move him to a private facility. Doctors at the hospital said he will not be able to use 108 ambulance for transfer to a private hospital. By the time his relatives found a private ambulance and moved him to a hospital in Chrompet, it was already six hours. “Doctors told me it was too late to save my limb. While the negligent driver caused the accident, the policy not to permit an ambulance to ferry people to hospitals of their choice delayed my treatment,” he said.

The family borrowed more money to pay Rs 6 lakh towards medical expenses. When he was finally back on his feet, his company told him he will not be able to continue in the service department. They offered him job in the administration department. “The last blow was a pay cut from a monthly salary of Rs 25,000 to Rs 8000,” he said.

Meeran is now awaiting compensation from TNSTC, Villupuram.

HYDERABAD: Around 250 students attended the ‘ Waterpreneurs ’ programme in the city aimed at making children understand and find solutions to water issues.

In the first session, students listened to YV Prakash from IIIT-H. “I spoke to the students over creating a framework to solve problems. The whole idea of the workshop is to provide students with the tools to address issues that they see around them.”

The first batch of 250 children will go through a four-month course and come up with 250 acts that will help address water-related issues. The programme was started by Rain Water Project, a social initiative started by city-based activist Kalpana Ramesh , which is partnering with Silver Oaks International School.

Ramesh said, “In the age of climate change, we want students to not just stand and protest, but to also be change-makers on the ground. It is important that they be part of the problem-solving process.”

Pradyun Chakraborty , a Class 6 student, said, “We have gotten a chance to address an issue that has been plaguing the city, that is, water crisis. Through actual action, we hope to make a difference.”

chaos central: Vehicles queue up in traffic jams in Allahabad on Sunday

Allahabad: Devotees and kalpwasis rushing back home after taking a dip in Sangam on Magh Purnima triggered yet traffic jams on several routes of the city on Sunday.

The rush of devotees hurrying back to their native towns and homes led to traffic snarls in routes near Shastri Bridge, Baihrana and Alopibagh. Some of these roads were choked due to movement of several tractor trolleys.

Apart from routes connecting Sangam and Magh Mela ground to the city, Phaphamau on Lucknow–Allahabad highway was chock-a-block with vehicles as visitors from districts like Pratapgarh, Jaunpur, Lucknow, Amethi and Rai Bareilly hurried back home.

Traffic inspector Harendra Singh said, “Several roads in Allahaabd were congested due to the large number of devotees retruning home, escpecially kalpwasis, from the Magh Mela ground.”

He also said that the devotees returning in tractor trolleys with their baggage added to the chaos on roads. The diversions introduced in view of the Magh Purnima snan did little to control the traffic mayhem.

Kalpwasis returning from the Magh Mela ground, meanwhile, blamed the chaos on roads on traffic police.

“We had planned to return to our native town in Mirzapur after the Magh Purnima snan. However, we were trapped in a traffic jam for more than two hours near Shastri Bridge. A few pilgrims were also stuck in a snarl for over an hour near New Sohbatiyabagh Road as well,” said one of the kalpwasis Atul Pandey.

Aditi, a devotee from Lucknow who was in Allahabad to visit the Magh Mela, said, “We were stuck in a snarl for over an hour near Baihrana.”

Sunday’s jam is not an isolated occurrence. The city has been reeling under traffic jams almost every weekend ever since the Magh Mela started.

Another commuter Harsh Mehrotra said, “It’s just like last Sunday and the one before that. My family and I were on our way to Jhunsi, but we were trapped in a jam. Meanwhile, the police did little as taxi and cab driver brazenly flouted traffic norms.”

Vehicles moved at snail’s pace near Baihrana, Alopibgah, Shastri Bridge and Daraganj throughout the day.

Traffic movement was worst hit between 11am and 6pm.

NEW DELHI: Dengue cases continue to be reported in the capital in spite of the long winter and unfavourable weather conditions for the breeding of mosquito larvae, suggests a report released by South Delhi Municipal Corporation ( SDMC ) on Monday.

According to the weekly report, two cases of dengue and three cases of chikungunya were reported last week. Similarly, six cases of malaria were reported last month. These figures are higher in comparison to number of dengue, chikungunya and malaria cases reported in 2019 till the end of February.

An SDMC official denied there was any specific reason for the early reports of dengue and chikungunya cases but accepted that the exercise for door-to-door visits of residential houses have been affected due to engagement of staff in assembly elections as well as Swachh Survekshan.

“However, clear instructions have been issued to all staff of the health department to restart exercise of visiting residential houses intensively from Monday,” said the official.

On February 19, SDMC also targets to call a joint meeting with officials from all three corporations, the Centre, Delhi government, sentinel surveillance hospitals, World Health Organisation and other agencies concerned for chalking out a detail action plan for controlling vector-borne diseases in 2020.

135,['11/02/2020'],Vehicle registrations hit the slow lane,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Registration of new vehicles in the capital district recorded a nearly 14% decline last year. As many as 1,09,760 were registered in Thiruvananthapuram in 2019 against 1,27,518 in 2018.

This is in stark contrast to the trend of the previous years. In 2018, the number of new vehicles had increased by 7% from a year earlier. “Vehicle registration in the past several years had recorded a positive growth. The drop in 2019 is attributed to the economic slowdown. The decline was sharpest in the commercial category, which was worst hit due to the crisis,” said R Joy, joint regional transport officer, Thiruvananthapuram RTO .

“However, two-wheeler registrations were little changed. A total of 25,067 two-wheelers were registered under Thiruvananthapuram RTO in 2019. This was 25,431in 2018. It is mostly the youth and office-goers who opt for two-wheelers,” Joy said.

Another reason cited by experts is the new pollution level norms notified by the Union government. The shift to Bharat stage (BS) VI emission standards by April 2020 has prompted a section of buyers to wait for new models with the standard specification.

Vehicle dealers claim the proposed shift to BS-VI and the recession have adversely affected the industry.

“There was drastic drop in vehicle sales in 2019, when compared with 2018 as the automobile industry was affected by the economic slowdown. Also, with the shift to BS-VI emission standards, people will not opt BS-IV vehicles unless they are given certain offers. Another issue is the unavailability of BS-VI fuel here,” said Jagan K Geroge, sales head, Pothens Hyundai, Thiruvananthapuram.

Thiruvananthapuram RTO posted a 14% decline in registrations 2019, while at Attingal RTO the drop was 15%. Nedumangad saw a 21.9% slip, Neyyattinkara 42%, Parassala 25% and Kazhakkoottam 8.46%.

The sub-regional transport office at Kattakada, because it was set up in September 2018, registered a 225% jump in 2019. No registration was recorded at the nationalised sector office at Kudappanakunnu, where transport buses are enrolled.

Also, there was no insistence on producing birth certificates to corroborate the DoB details. “However, during the NRC exercise, the authorities will insist on birth certificates of the respondents while filling the forms. This is where the crux lies. The Aadhaar card DoB details will have no meaning in NRC,” highly-placed sources said.The Unique Identity Authority of India (UIDAI) has data of people who, at the time of enrolment, did not produce their birth certificates but merely gave the operators their DoB details. Though Aadhaar cards would not reveal if the DoB is genuine or not, the back-end data will have information, say officials.UIDAI had clearly marked two categories of DoBs — notified and non-notified. Notified are the ones who have shown their birth certificates at the time of enrolment. And non-notified ones are those who had given their DoB details verbally.The non-notified DoBs were again sub-categorised into two — declared and assumed DoBs. Assumed DoBs belong to those who are not in the know of their DoB and merely quoted some date.

NAGPUR: Social media rumours about the spread of coronavirus through non-vegetarian food have started bringing losses to poultry farmers in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Especially, chicken and egg consumption in Vidarbha has seen a remarkable decline in last three weeks as many people have started avoiding chicken, eggs and meat believing rumours that coronavirus spreads through it.Dr Raju Dudhbade of Vidarbha poultry farmers’ association (VPFA) said that farmers are left with no option but to sell full grown birds at throwaway prices. “Keeping a full-grown bird for a day costs Rs4.5 to a farmer. Small farmers having 500 to 1000 such birds suffer huge losses. Small poultry farmers usually deal through traders. So, they have no option but to sell their birds at low costs to traders,” he said.Top restaurants in Nagpur, too, said that there’s a drop in chicken consumption.Maharashtra Animal and Fisheries Science University (MAFSU) came in support of poultry farmers on Monday. MAFSU vice-chancellor, Dr Ashish Paturkar , appealed to people to not believe any fake news regarding coronavirus.“Research about the origin, pathogenesis and epidemiology of coronavirus is presently at a very initial stage. It might have originated through non-vegetarian food but the food practices in China are more responsible for it,” he said, adding, Indian food practices make food free from virus and bacteria.“Traditionally, Indian non-veg delicacies are well cooked and full of spices which make our food nearly virus-free. There is no need to curb non-vegetarian food if we are cooking our traditional recipes,” he said.MAFSU director of research, Dr Nitin Kurkure , said that the university has decided to create awareness about coronavirus. “Students in all colleges affiliated to MAFSU will soon visit nearby towns and villages to clear these misconceptions. Having good quality non-veg food will keep your immunity intact and maintain fitness level. This is very important to fight any viral infection. Hence, there is no need to stop eating chicken, eggs or meat,” he said.MAFSU will soon establish a health centre in Nagpur where research on such mutations in viruses will be conducted separately.Fake news effectEgg prices in Nagpur declined from Rs4.75/piece on January 1 to Rs3.90 on Feb 10: NECKChicken consumption in Nagpur came down to 150 tons/day from 300 tons/day in last 2 weeks: VPFAAs consumption has declined, traders are buying less birds from poultry farmersBut, farmers must sell off full-grown birds because its loss-making to keep them at farmsBird buying rates for traders which used to be around Rs80/Kg in Jan is less than Rs50/Kg in FebPoultry farmers stare at uncertain future as they don’t know when rumours will get clearedAccording to MAFSU, there is no harm in having well-cooked non-veg foodEggs, meat and chicken helps maintaining fitness and improves immunity and should be consumed",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74078754,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-89006,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/poultry-farmers-in-financial-trouble-due-to-coronavirus-related-rumours/articleshow/74071429.cms

Bhopal: In a major reshuffle of Indian Police Service (IPS) officers on Monday, the state government transferred 52 officers including five of the rank of the additional director general of police (ADGP), five of the rank of inspector general (IGs) and 16 superintendents of police.

Those transferred include Manoj Kumar Rai SP of Chhindwara, the native district of chief minister Kamal Nath to Neemuch.

Likewise, SP Bhopal, South Sampat Upadhyaya has been transferred to Sheopur. He will be replaced by Sai Krishna S Thota who was AIG intelligence PHQ. DIG Indore, rural, Sanjay Tiwari has been transferred to Bhopal.

Among top officers, ADG (Administration) Kailash Makwana and ADG (Narcotics) Ajay Sharma have swapped each other's positions.

Similarly, ADG (State Crime Record Bureau) GP Singh has been transferred as ADG (Anti-Naxal operations). ADG (Home guards), Jabalpur, Rajesh Chawla will replace Singh. G Janardhan, ADG (JN Police Academy, Sagar) has been moved to Shahdol in the same capacity.

Besides, SPs of 16 districts, namely Shahdol, Hoshangabad, Chhatarpur, Bhind, Indore (East), Agar Malwa, Guna, Betul, Damoh, Bhopal (South), Burhanpur, Sheopur, Singrauli, Neemuch, and Harda have been transferred.

The transfer order sparked a Twitter war between BJP and Congress. Leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava tweeted, “Transfer industry has again started in Madhya Pradesh. Till now, only 52 IPS officers have been transferred. In future, long lists will come. ‘Bring money and take order’ — this remains Nath government’s real meaning of law and order. MP government has no other work. Everyone is mentally oppressed.”

State Congress spokesman and CM Kamal Nath’s media convener Narendra Saluja hit back by tweeting: “The government which made transfers an industry during its 15-year rule is levelling false allegations against the Kamal Nath government. During its rule, it was an open secret that officials were asked to bring money and take transfer orders. Everyone knows who ran the transfer industry and who possessed a currency counting machine. Even ministers were unhappy with the transfer industry during BJP rule.”

Aurangabad: The district-level porters’ body on Monday held a demonstration at Beed district collectorate seeking payment of their pending dues while working at the government grain godowns.

Out of the 199 porters registered with the body, 180 porters participated in the protest. The stir was withdrawn after district supply officer assured them that their issues will be addressed within four days.

The Shaskiya Dhanya Godam Hamal Panchayat submitted a letter to the office of Beed district collector on Monday. Rajkumar Ghayal, the president of the porters’ body stated that owing to various technical reasons the porters working at the government grain godowns are not getting their wages for the last six months.

According to Maharashtra Mathadi Hamal and other Manual Workers (Regulation of Employment and Welfare) Act, 1969, the porters’ are paid through district-level mathadi board. The contractors in the godowns should deposit their wages and the district collector should deposit the levy to the Board. The workers are paid when the Board receives both payments on time.

Out of the 23 government godowns in Beed district, 12 are run by contractors and 11 have no contractor. “In the 11 godowns directly run by the district supply office, the mathadis have not received payment since December while in 12 godowns, the contractors have not deposited the payment since August due to which the workers are bereft of their wages for the last six months,” Ghayal said.

The delay in payment is also because the go-down keeper does not issue bills on time, he said.

Marking the protest, all 23 government godowns were shut on Monday. Notably, in the absence of a full-time district collector for the last 2 months, the issues were piling up. When a delegation of the protesting porters met with the district supply officer on Monday, they were told that the new district collector Rahul Rekhawar has taken charge of the office on Monday and the payments of workers will be cleared within 4 days.

Volunteers collect waste from Saroornagar Lake

HYDERABAD: Volunteers who have been cleaning up Saroornagar Lake at their own expense have collected around 1,000 kg of waste from the lake. They said that the struggle to keep water bodies clean is becoming an uphill task.

Kota Saikumar, a college student who gives up his Sundays for the drive, said, “We find huge amounts of plastic and puja material. People pray at home and dump religious items in the lake.” He added that the waste picked up is not even a fraction of what gets into the lake. “We are only able to reach the borders of the lake and have requested authorities to help clean the entire water body,” he said.

Putting the onus on residents, Satish Chandra from the group Helping Hands Humanity said, “Awareness must be created among people to ensure that they do not litter. Laws pertaining to keeping lakes and other water bodies clean must be implemented.” From the government’s perspective, he said it was time fencing is carried out.

Gali Vinila Reddy, who works with Vrikshit Foundation , said the problem lies in the lack of awareness among people. “We get no support from locals who should be more proactive in saving the environment.”

Kozhikode: IUML has come out against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan for his recent statement against aided school managements warning them against appointment of teachers by providing inflated number of students.

IUML state general secretary KPA Majeed said at the state conference of IUML-affiliated Kerala State Teachers’ Union (KSTU) on Monday that the chief minister should not think that education sector can be cleansed by intimidating school managements.

“The chief minister has taken an intimidating stand against school managements in his traditional style. No one should think that they can cleanse the education sector by threatening managements, teachers or staff. It is not going to work. The chief minister should think about the substantial contributions of school managements for towards the educational development of the state,” he added.

Majeed said that around 3,000 school teachers in the state were not getting their salaries as the government was delaying sanction to their appointments.

Majeed said that it is natural to have protected teachers in the state and that was due to the overall decrease in the number of students. “The problem should be resolved constructively without taking a negative approach towards it. Teachers should not be penalized for that,” he added.

Meanwhile, the remarks made by Majeed in the speech that people are being made to look for holes in the classrooms after some student got bitten by a snake in the classroom created a controversy, following which he issued an explanation. He was referring to the death of Shahala Sherin, a Class V student of the Government Sarvajana Vocational Higher Secondary School at Sulthan Bathery, who died after being bitten by a snake in the classroom in November last year.

In his Facebook post, Majeed said that he was drawing attention to the stand by the Pinarayi Vijayan government to hound the aided school managements.

“The student had died following snakebite in a government school. But instead of improving the facilities at government schools, the government was trying to hound aided schools in the name of the incident,” he added.

HYDERABAD: A day after AIMIM legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi met Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao seeking funds to develop a temple in the Old City, Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen took a jibe at him wondering if he had become a “better man”.

In her tweet on Monday, she said: “Akbaruddin Owaisi who wanted to kill Hindus if police is removed for 15 minutes, now want Rs 10 crore for the development of Mahankali temple! Is he wearing a mask? Or he has become a better man!(sic)” She also recalled Akbaruddin’s speech he had made at Nirmal in 2013.

In 2007, Nasreen was allegedly roughed by AIMIM members in Press Club when she was in the city to launch a book . Some party legislators were also part of the group which allegedly attacked her verbally and hurled bouquets at her. Nasreen has been living in exile since 1994.

Akbaruddin, in some of the public meetings he had addressed, was also critical of her. “Taslima Nasreen aayi thi, kahan gayi kisi ko pata nahi (Nasreen came here but no one has a clue as to where she has gone),” he used to say at the public rallies.

Meanwhile, after Akbaruddin urged the CM to allot Rs 10 crore towards development of Simhavahini Mahankali temple at Lal Darwaja, members of the temple committee visited AIMIM headquarters Darussalam and felicitated Yakutpura MLA Ahmed Pasha Quadri.

“We thank AIMIM and the chief minister. When we met Akbaruddin at a meeting, he told us that mosque and temple are like two eyes to him. We are going by the Ganga-Jamuna tehzeeb,” said a committee member. When questioned about BJP legislator from Goshamahal T Raja Singh, he said that they were not bothered about him. “We are members of the temple committee.

25 fire fighters from two fire stations defuse the fire which broke out on Monday evening due to short-circuit

Vadodara: A big fire broke out in an electrical shop at crowded Mangal Bazaar on Monday evening.

However, as the market remains closed on Monday, there was no evacuation or panic.

The fire broke out around 5.30pm due to short-circuit on the ground floor of the shop which was closed. Due to presence of lights and several other electrical equipment, the fire spread across the shop quickly.

It further spread to the shop’s godown on the upper floors.

“The shop has its godown on three floors above the shop which was also engulfed. Our staff of 25 fire fighters from two fire stations controlled the fire in an hour,” said fire officer Manish Mod. He added that the fire fighters had to break shutters of the neighbouring shops to shift their goods so that the fire does not spread further.

Although the market was closed, hundreds of people gathered at the spot due to which fire fighters found it difficult to bring their vehicles in the narrow lane and conduct the operation.

A fire department source said that a couple of policemen were sent from the local police station but they could also not control the crowd.

Eventually, the fire fighters themselves had to close down the lane from Nava Bazaar and Mangal Bazaar ends.

The owner of the shop told the fire officials that the loss caused by fire ranges in lakhs of rupees.

A drill by fire department had showed that agencies couldn't even reach the inner parts of the market

NEW DELHI: Seven years since it issued a series of orders to check illegal eateries in Hauz Khas Village, Delhi high court has now left it to the agencies concerned to take action.

The court had described the area as a “ticking time bomb” after it emerged that a drill conducted by security agencies and fire preparedness by Delhi Fire Department showed agencies couldn’t even reach the inner parts of the market due to rampant illegal commercialisation.

While the petitioners insisted that court’s monitoring is needed to prevent civic agencies and police from ignoring illegal restaurants, more so since many didn’t even posess valid fire clearance, a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar put their faith in the authorities, asking these to “act as per law” and disposed of two PILs filed in 2013 and 2017, respectively.

The bench made it clear that if any pubs, restaurants or bars are running illegally in Hauz Khas Village, agencies must take action after hearing out the owners or occupiers.

One of the petitions had alleged that over 120 restaurants and pubs were running in the area without any approved building plans or no objection certificate (NOC) from the authorities including the fire department.

“We hereby direct respondent 1 to 5 (Centre, Delhi government and civic bodies) to look into the grievances ventilated in this petition and if any illegal pubs, restaurants, bars, etc. are being run in the area, action shall be initiated by respondent 1 to 5 in accordance with law, rules, regulations and government policy applicable to the facts of the present case after giving an adequate opportunity of being heard to the owner or occupier of the premises in question,” the court observed in its order last week.

In 2017, an alarmed bench of justices Gita Mittal and C Hari Shankar had described Hauz Khas Village as “a ticking time bomb”, underlining that neither government agencies, nor restaurant owners of the area responded to its queries on safety and other issues.

It had subsequently ordered sealing of 21 eateries, warning the associations of restaurants owners that they will not be allowed escape civil and criminal liability in case any unfortunate incident takes place, as there was virtually no space for emergency vehicles to enter the area.

It had also sought to know how South Delhi Municipal Corporation, Delhi Police, Delhi Fire Services and other agencies, had allowed commercialisation of the village that had led to public nuisance and health hazards.

While the first plea was filed by activist Pankaj Sharma , a second petition in 2017 by advocate Anuja Kapur also raised the same problem, alleging that the streets in the village were not wide enough for a fire tender to move easily in case of an emergency and very few restaurants had fire clearances.

Chennai: “Freedom isn’t just political, or limited to raising flags and slogans. It is so much more – annihilation of caste, safety of women, growth of downtrodden. And that way, India may be independent, but far from free yet,” said poet, writer and Tibetan activist Tenzin Tsundue, as media students at Loyola College listened to him in rapt attention.

Visiting his alma mater to give a talk on ‘writing and resistance’, the activist with the red head band - which has become a symbol of his free-Tibet movement - urged the students to fight for freedom judiciously and in a non-violent way as thinkers, writers, educators and journalists. “We see incidents being captured by CCTV and sophisticated mobile phone cameras, and yet cannot ascertain what happened,” he said. “You don’t have to join a political party to fight for freedom. But in an age when the truth is neutralised, fake news is spreading and media houses caught up with breaking news are losing credibility, the role of a writer is to determine the truth through information and perspectives from many sources, and refrain from becoming judgmental,” he said.

Tsundue also delved into his own journey as an activist, poet and writer, and reminisced how as a student he often wrote poems touching upon the idea of home and brotherhood to his “rich friends with fancy houses”. He expressed how being in exile, slapped with court cases and jailed 16 times – the latest at Chennai Central Jail during Chinese premier Xi Jinping’s visit last year – pushed him to think, write and express.

“The idea of exile is this – you have to leave your home, come to a new place and be unable to settle down, physically and emotionally. Your future looks bleak and you’re trapped in the reality of today and the dream of tomorrow. But one who doesn’t belong anywhere, can live everywhere. For me, home is not a house. It is the adjustment you make in your heart,” the award-winning author said.

Highlighting the need to change the way English language and literature is taught, Tsundue said greater emphasis should be given to independent writing and thought in the curriculum. “English literature was started by the British as an experiment to make it easier for Indians to serve them. But for the last 271 years, we have been reading the same age-old Victorian literature, their comedy, politics, etc. While there’s nothing wrong with this, we have to be able to write our own language and stories too. We must find our own voice.”

Aurangabad: With only one day left to receive objections on ward reservations and ward formation, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) election department has so far received bagful of objections from citizens.

The Satara and Deolai wards were added to the AMC in the year 2016 after by-polls were held for the two seats (ward numbers 114 and 115). During the by-polls, ward 114 was open, while 115 was reserved for the scheduled tribes (ST) category.

However, this time around, the area has been divided into five wards i.e. ward number 105 Atharva Classic-Sudhakar Nagar, 112 Kasliwal Bhagyoday-Vasant Vihar Deolai, 113 Gopinathpuram-Hariom Nagar, 114 Satara Ganv-Sangram Nagar and 115 Deolai Ganv Satara Tanda.

According to the ward plan declared for 2020 civic elections, ward number 105, 112, 113 and 114 are reserved for scheduled caste (SC) women, while 115 is reserved for SC. For all the other wards, the election department has decided the reservation based on the three previous general elections held in 2005, 2010 and 2015.

Residents and aspiring candidates have stated that as the area have been included in AMC general elections for the first time the reservations should have been fixed only through draw. Objections related to ward reservation and formation of Satara and Deolai have been filed with the election department.

On Monday, Shiv Sena communication head Vinod Ghosalkar held discussions with corporators and aspiring candidates from the party who registered their objections related to ward formation and ward reservation.

The corporators told Ghosalkar that ward reservation process has led to dissatisfaction among party workers. Some of the corporators said that the very existence of their wards have been removed from the new plan.

After hearing the objections, Ghosalkar said if the norms of the election commission have been side-lined in the process then these objections will be brought to the notice of the guardian minister who will then take up the issue with the chief minister. “It will be ensured that no one faces injustice due to wrongful implementation of the plan,” he said.

Asaduddin Owaisi

HYDERABAD: AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi upped the ante against the Citizenship Act, saying he will choose death but will not display any documents during CAA, NRC and NPR exercise.

“You guys are threatening me. Will you shoot me? Do whatever you can, but I will stay in this country and never ever show my documents,” thundered Owaisi while addressing an anti-CAA rally in Kurnool on Monday.

Going all out against the BJP leadership, the Hyderabad MP said: “If the question arises of showing documents, we will show our chests. This is where our documents are hidden. Shoot me in my heart as my love for the nation resides in my heart, which you (rightwing members) people are yet to understand.”

During the course of his fiery speech amidst loud claps and cheers, Owaisi kept repeating to the crowds that neither he nor any Muslim would show documents to the authorities. “Our name is enough to prove our love and loyalty towards this country.” Kurnool has sizeable Muslim population.

Taking potshots at PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah, he said: “Only those who are raising their voice against Modi-Shah duo are true crusaders.”

Owaisi also said the protests across the country should not stop. “These protests should continue for the next three months. If we fail in this fight, then remember Bharat will become a Hindu rashtra,” said the AIMIM chief, who also raised the quota issue.

“I want to say to my Dalit brothers and sisters, if you love BR Ambedkar, this is the time to prove your love. This is the time to show your love towards Babasaheb. Article 14 of the Constitution says reservation should be given to SCs. But, the BJP government in Uttarakhand says in the SC that quota and promotion are not fundamental rights,” he said.

Exhorting Dalits to oppose this strongly, he said: “ Please wake up my Dalit brothers, please read paragraph 21 of the judgment which says appointments and promotions are not fundamental rights.”

In a press statement here, BJP spokesperson K Krisha Saagar Rao said this exposed their intellectual and political bankruptcy. “The GHMC mayor and his deputy have made a fool of themselves along with TRS and AIMIM corporators,” he said.

He said passing a resolution against a non-existent national law by a local body was juvenile.

He said NRC is a figment of imagination of minority appeasers as there is neither a bill nor a law so far on NRC. “GHMC mayor and his deputy should explain how one can pass a resolution against a national law which is non-existent.”

The staff handed Rani over a lakh rupees and several gifts for her daughter's wedding

NEW DELHI: Rani , a sweeper at Barakhamba police station, was worried for the past many days. Reason: Her daughter was scheduled to get married on February 14, but she did not have enough money to buy jewelleries for her and even manage the logistics for the guests. But she got a pleasant surprise this Sunday when the police station officers and staff handed her over a lakh rupees and several gifts for her daughter’s wedding .

Rani (45) is the breadwinner of her family, and her husband, who used to work with her earlier at the same police station, had passed away three years back. “I have been working at the police station for over 13 years now. After my husband’s death, our financial condition has deteriorated. My earnings mostly go in paying the house rent and the day-to-day expenses. I had asked police officers for some help, but did not expect them to do so much for my daughter’s wedding,” Rani told TOI.

The sweeper earns a meagre Rs 7,500 per month and has been employed by a private company.

“Now, there will be raunak (shine) in the celebrations. I am planning to buy my daughter a gold earring and arrange for decent logistics for the guests. I had approached several people for money, but in today’s world no one lends a helping hand. I am grateful to SHO Prahlad Singh and Delhi Police for this noble gesture,” she said.

“Since we were aware about her financial condition, we decided to pool in money for her daughter’s wedding. Some officers even bought sarees and gifts for her,” said an officer at the police station.

“Rani is a hardworking and a kind woman. This is the least we could do for her. We all will be going for the wedding,” added Singh.

Rani has five children, including three daughters. Her eldest son is married and stays separately. Sonali is the first among the three daughters to get married.

(All names have been changed to protect identity)

NEW DELHI: February 6 was a black day in the life of Esha, a third-year political science student at Gargi College. She had walked in expecting to enjoy and dance to the tunes of singer Jubin Nautiyal, who was to perform at the annual fest “Reverie”. However, she and other students of the girls’ college were in for a rude surprise.The musical evening turned into a harrowing experience as outsiders, mainly middle-aged men, barged into the college campus by prising the gates apart and even climbing over the boundary wall, which had barbed wire, and started groping, molesting and touching the girls. Many men even rubbed against the helpless girls.The girls had sordid tales to tell about the evening, and many of them submitted testimonies highlighting the horror they went through. The night turned even more traumatic for Esha as her friend, who has asthma, collapsed on the ground making it difficult for them to escape the sexual harassment.Esha said, “Around 3.30pm, a huge crowd had gathered outside the two gates, one for girl students and other for men. By the time we entered, the ground was packed with drunk men, who were passing lewd comments at the girls. My friend, who was suffering from asthma, collapsed after feeling claustrophobic and we had to call her father to come to our aid.”While college students were allowed to attend the fest by showing their identity card, each of them were also issued a pass to bring along an outsider. The 3,000 students, coupled with their passes, would have accounted for 6,000 people on the ground, but the girls said that there was a 10,000-strong crowd there.“The entry was supposed to close at 4.30pm, but people kept entering even two hours later. Though a stampede nearly occurred, police just stood there and did nothing. Security had been breached, but no action followed,” said Sayema, a third-year political science student.Another student narrated how a man ran towards her and dashed into her purposely. He then went on to grope her and left. One girl decided to confront a few men, but regretted her decision. “I was so angry that I went toward a group of men. I realised they were all drunk. I feel ashamed to narrate what they told me. I got scared and ran away,” she added.A second-year student started panicking when, taking advantage of the crowd, a man started groping her. “It became impossible for me move to a safe place as there was no space,” she said. It took her nearly 40 minutes to go from the ground to the gate, which usually takes five minutes.Describing how the security ring was broken, a student said, “A car came and the guards opened the gate to let it in. The crowd, which had swelled to a considerable number due to the slow checking process, then barged in. Some men even jumped over the wall despite the barbed wire on top of it.”Many students also complained that they couldn’t dial 100 as there was no mobile network coverage. Priya, a second-year student, said, “It seems the men had just come to harass girls. They also threw eggs at us.”In Video: Students complain of 'Mass molestation' at Gargi college fest, Delhi Police and Principal face heat",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74073270,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-710236,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/drunk-men-groped-girls-cops-just-stood-there/articleshow/74071459.cms

YAVATMAL: The suspension of junior resident doctor at Shri Vasantrao Naik Government Medical College, Yavatmal , was revoked on Monday.

home-bound: Devotees return home after the Maghi Purnima snan on the Magh Mela ground in Allahabad on Monday

Allahabad: Apart from the five snans that draw devotees from all across the world to the Magh Mela, there is one more few know about — the Trijata snan. As per tradition, kalpwasis who stay back on the Magh Mela ground even after the end of their month-long penance take a dip in Sangam during the Trijata snan. The snan will be observed on Tuesday.

City-based religious scholar Ashutosh Varshney said, “Most kalpwasis leave for home after after taking a dip in Ganga during the Maghi Purnima snan. As the Hindu month of Magh culminates after Maghi Purnima, some kalpwasis wait for the right muhurat (auspicious period) for returning after a special snan called the Trijata snan.”

Varshney said that Trijata was a demoness in Ramayan, who was assigned the duty of guarding Sita in Ashok Vatika after Ravana abducted her.

He also said that Ram and Sita had given Trijata a vardan (boon) before returning to Ayodhya. “According to Hindu mythology, Ram and Sita said that any one who takes three dips in Ganga after Magh ends in the name of Trijata will gain punya equivalent to a month of kalpwas,” Varshney said.

“It is also believed that kalpwasis can atone for all mistakes and sins committed during their stay by taking a dip in Ganga during Trijata snan.” he added.

Meanwhile, hundreds of devotees continued to leave the Magh Mela ground after taking holy dips in Sangam on Monday. The deployment of police forces on the venue helped in managing the crowd. Traffic police also enforced diversions to regulate traffic.

NEW DELHI: The members of Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association ( JNU ) assembled in front of the Delhi Police headquarters on Monday protesting against the inaction regarding the violence by masked miscreants on the campus on January 5.

“This inaction serves to only reinforce suspicions about the reasons behind the failure of police on that fateful day to prevent the mob violence or apprehend any of the culprits,” they stated in a memorandum addressed to police commissioner Amulya Patnaik.

During its January 10 press conference on the progress of the investigation, Delhi Police emphasised almost exclusively on previous incidents while remaining silent about the mob violence, they alleged. “No further progress has been reported,” the memorandum added. According to JNUTA, none of the 60-odd complaints filed on the mob violence, including those submitted by teachers, has been converted into an FIR. “All the evidence, therefore, indicates that the Special Investigation Team has put the investigation in cold storage,” JNUTA alleged, adding that, “it appears to be a part of a larger pattern where police are more proactive in restraining the exercise of democratic rights in the name of maintaining law and order than it is in protecting these rights”.

A delegation met special CP (intelligence) Praveer Ranjan. A spokesperson said they had briefed the delegation about the status of the probe. “Special CP (intelligence) Ranjan has also assured them of all cooperation ,” he added.

Several students and teachers were injured in the attack, during which hostel properties were also damaged.

172,['11/02/2020'],‘3 vehicles were stolen in Allahabad every day in Jan’,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Allahabad: Auto-lifters made off with three vehicles every day in the city in January in Allahabad district, says police data released on Monday.

According to the data, 115 cases of auto thefts were reported between January 1 and January 31, 2020 in Allahabad district — the highest among the eight districts comprising Allahabad zone.

The eight districts comprising Allahabad zone are Allahabad, Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Fatehpur, Banda, Hamirpur, Mahoba and Chitrakoot. Hamirpur was at the bottom of the list with zero auto-thefts during the period, followed by Banda (2) and Chitrakoot (2).

Allahabad was followed by Pratapgarh (30), Kaushambi (15), and Fatehpur (seven).

In 2019, Allahabad recorded over 1,500 cases of auto-theft, which included 1,345 stolen motorcycles.

Crime branch officials said that 18 auto-lifting gangs were busted last year and most of the accused were in their 20s and 30s. The arrests indicate how more and more youth are foraying into this crime, said police.

Police said most youths resort to stealing cars and motorcycles in order to earn quick money and to lead a lavish lifestyle. In 2019, police arrested over 150 men for auto-lifting and most of them did not have a criminal background.

During the period, police also recovered more than 300 stolen vehicles. Police said that auto-lifters see localities in trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna areas of the city as safe hideouts for their loot.

less radiation

Thiruvananthapuram: The health department is set to introduce SPECT (single-photon emission computerized tomography) scan at Thiruvananthapuram Medical College for the first time.

SPECT scanner (help in analysing internal organs) will be installed in the department of nuclear medicine as part of upgrading the medical college into a centre of excellence, health minister said. SPECT scan will enable scanning using lesser amount of radiation when compared to X-ray or CT scan, the minister said. SPECT scan is rarely used in hospitals in the state. The state budget has allotted Rs 8 crore for the project, the minister said.

According to hopkinsmedicine.org, nuclear medicine is a specialized area of radiology that uses small amounts of radioactive materials, or radiopharmaceuticals, to examine organ function and structure. Nuclear medicine imaging is a combination of many different disciplines. These include chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer technology, and medicine. This branch of radiology is often used to help diagnose and treat abnormalities early in the progression of a disease, such as thyroid cancer, the website notes.

Digirad website defines SPECT as a type of non-invasive nuclear imaging test that allows doctor to see how well the internal organs are functioning. It uses a radioactive substance and a special gamma camera to create 3-D pictures of the organs at different angles.

The technology not only offers better sensitivity and high energy resolution, but also makes the camera smaller in size than a traditional MRI machine. And, with their open and upright design, they’re much more ergonomic and patient-friendly. While an X-ray takes a picture of what the organs look like at a given point in time, a SPECT image shows blood flowing to and from the heart or blood flow restrictions due to narrow or blocked arteries. It can also be used to evaluate brain and neurological conditions and bone disorders.

It can also help diagnose disease processes that may be underway, including narrowing of the arteries, clogged arteries, identifying scar tissue due to heart attacks, or evaluating the success of surgeries like bypass surgery, according to Digirad.

NAGPUR: Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis continues to give the judiciary the slip. On Monday, he cited an important meeting in Mantralaya to skip his case hearing for the fourth time.

While granting a last chance to the former chief minister, the court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) PS Ingle directed him to appear on February 20. He sought an exemption from appearing before the court in a case filed by lawyer Satish Uke, contending that the Southwest MLA had allegedly suppressed information about two pending criminal cases while filing his affidavit for the 2014 assembly polls.

Earlier, Fadnavis’ lawyer Uday Dable filed an application stating that an important meeting of the assembly’s advisory committee was convened at Mantralaya at 3pm to discuss the business transaction for the upcoming budget session and hence, it was not possible for his client to appear before the honourable court.

The Mantralaya meeting was attended by CM Uddhav Thackeray , deputy CM Ajit Pawar , cabinet ministers and Fadnavis, who was there as Leader of Opposition.

Fadnavis’ application was strongly opposed by Uke’s counsel Sudeep Jaiswal .

Uke also filed an application for criminal contempt of court against Fadnavis, who was made the accused in the case.

Uke accused the ex-CM of deliberate fraud which interfered in the delivery of justice. Dable then sought time to reply to the contempt application.

While allowing Fadnavis’ application for adjournment, the CJM granted him a last chance to appear before the court on February 20.

Earlier, Fadnavis skipped the hearings on December 4, January 4 and February 10 citing “official” reasons.

On October 1, 2019, the Supreme Court ruled against Fadnavis, clarifying that a candidate must disclose all criminal cases at the time of contesting the election. The SC then sent the case to the JMFC court for retrial. The trial court of judge SB Mehta issued summons to the ex-CM as an accused and asked him to remain present on December 4 for seeking bail.

175,['11/02/2020'],Over 76L kids below 5 don’t have Aadhaar,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Aurangabad: More than 76 lakh children , between the ages of zero and 5 years, are still not enrolled for Aadhhar in Maharashtra , which has reflected in terms of the poor 21st rank for the state at the national level among 37 states and Union Territories in terms of Aadhaar saturation.

As per the latest official data of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), out of a total population of 0-5years children (1,01,57,823), only 24,02,011 have been assigned the key 12-digit Aadhaar number.

While Maharashtra has relatively less Aadhaar penetration among this population, the state has also found itself at a poor 24th place when it comes to the desired enrollment for the 5-18 years age group. In this case, of the total target population of 2,95,26,954, only 2,34,17,030 had enrolled with Aadhaar till January 20. This accounts for 79.3% Aadhaar saturation in the 5-18 years age group.

At the national level, Haryana and Delhi top in Aadhaar enrolment for children below five years and up to the age of 18 years, respectively.

In January 2017, Osmanabad district in Marathwada had achieved state-level distinction by becoming the first district in Maharashtra to offer Aadhaar card at the birth of a child. While Madhya Pradesh had witnessed the first issuance of Aadhaar card to an infant in May 2016, Osmanabad administration replicated the practice on a large scale.

An official e-mail sent to Rupinder Singh, the deputy director-general of UIDAI’s regional office in Mumbai, and three assistant directors, seeking reasons for the relatively poor Aadhaar enrolment in the state remained unanswered till Monday night.

A senior IAS official, preferring anonymity, said lack of awareness among parents was one of the reasons. “Rural areas have Anganwadis at many places and special instructions have been given to the staff to carry out Aadhaar enrolment of children. In urban areas, the enrollment is initiated by parents for scholarship or other purposes. It is a fact that some of the larger states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have lesser Aadhaar saturation when compared to other states,” he said.

Social activist Vishnu Dhobale said the state government must facilitate Aadhaar enrollment at birth at all major hospitals. “Aadhaar enrolment must be made available at state-run hospitals as well as private hospitals. Such a measure would benefit parents as well as the state agencies,” he said.

Sharma, who sent the NCW team to the college on Monday, also raised concern over the security lapses on the part of the college that enabled the men to enter the college.

Speaking to TOI, the NCW chief said that the commission’s team visited the college and has spoken to the girls. “Our team spoke to the girls and police. We want police to take strict action as it is shocking how outsiders were able to enter the college.

An NGO has written to the Delhi forest department, asking for action against NDMC for cutting 'healthy' and fu... Read More

NEW DELHI: A Delhi-based environmental NGO has accused New Delhi Municipal Council ( NDMC ) of chopping at least 22 fully grown Ashoka trees at Lodhi Gardens—well beyond the “permissible” pruning limit under Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994. In a letter sent to the Delhi forest and wildlife department, New Delhi Nature Society (NDNS) has said that 22 “healthy” Ashoka trees have been felled at Lodhi Garden.

“On Sunday, I found that 22 healthy Ashoka trees had been felled (head-backed) in Lodhi Gardens by NDMC. All the tree canopies were completely removed. These trees were not even a threat to anybody’s life or property,” said Verhaen Khanna , founder of NDNS.

The NGO has also attached photographs in the letter, asking the forest department to act immediately. “You are requested to follow procedure under Section 8 of Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994,” Khanna added.

When contacted, the forest department said they have already formed a team of officials to inspect the trees and determine the extent of the damage caused. “The team will first assess if they were fully grown trees or not. They will also determine how much damage is caused and whether it is beyond the permissible limits. Later, we will check if permission was sought for the same,” said Ishwar Singh , principal chief conservator of forests .

“A report will be prepared and if anyone is found to be guilty, we will initiate immediate action in the matter,” added Singh.

A senior NDMC official, however, denied the allegations and said no trees had been cut or chopped. They have only been pruned to improve their shape, he added.

“These are not trees, but topiary planted in different sizes and shapes to give an aesthetic look to the garden. We don’t need permission from the forest department to prune them as per requirement, unlike full-fledged trees grown in forest, roadsides or even park areas. Another reason for pruning these 15 plants was to allow sufficient sunlight in nearby butterfly garden. With sufficient sunlight, citrus plants can attract butterflies. We are doing everything in a planned manner,” the official said.

179,['11/02/2020'],Zoo authorities face flak for addition of female spotted deer,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Aurangabad: Even if the state zoo authority has clearly taken a stand against introducing any new creature in the city zoo, the latter has decided to get in four spotted deer from Mumbai zoo in exchange of two tigers.

Notably, the Zoo Authority of Maharashtra (ZAM) had asked for the ban owing to inadequate space at the local zoo along with other glaring non-compliances, which had led to temporary de-recognition of the zoo by the Central Zoo Authority of India (CZAI).

When contacted, zoo director B S Naikwade on Monday said that addition of four spotted deer can be viewed as a totaling exercise and would not increase the count of total creatures in the zoo significantly.

“Two creatures are getting deducted from the local population of animals at our zoo due to relocation of tigers. Mumbai-based zoo is expected to hand over two male and two female spotted deer after receiving the pair of tigers from Aurangabad. The zoo has only one herd of female spotted deer and male partners were needed for mating,” he said.

While unavailability of mating partners for some of the creatures housed in the zoo was one of the non-compliances observed by the CZAI and it is getting addressed, animal lovers have questioned the rationale behind increasing the female population.

“The zoo authorities must make public the rationale behind increasing the count of female spotted deer at the city zoo. The enclosure for spotted deer is also small and unnecessary crowding must be avoided till the zoo gets moved to the new place,” animal lover Nilesh Dharashivkar said.

A two-member team from the ZAM, comprising senior forest department officials, had inspected the local zoo on December 5, 2017. The visit was planned in the wake of suo-motu PIL initiated by Aurangabad bench of Bombay High Court for relocation of two elephants in response to TOI report highlighting the sorry state of affairs at the city zoo.

Following the visit, top officials concerned had clearly decided against any addition at the local zoo. The visiting members also maintained that the movement of Sambar deer could be only allowed only for changing the bloodline.

Animal lovers and activists, meanwhile, have expressed anger over the procedural delays taking place in the relocation of the existing zoo to Mitmita.

Vadodara: A retired associate professor of microbiology at MS University (MSU) passed away at his home in Sama on Sunday morning.

Johannes Manjrekar (62) was found dead when his friends went to check on him on Sunday morning. According to police, Manjrekar’s family members, who live in Mumbai, used to call him every morning.

181,['11/02/2020'],Handiwork of TN women set to go online,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Marketing for S Anandhi, a Sirumugai silk sari weaver, and her 12-member self-help group ( SHG ), has meant selling her work to middlemen — either the wholesaler who also supplies her raw material or the handloom owner for whom she would work for daily wages. That the weave made headlines only a couple of months ago being Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s gift to Chinese President Xi Jinping, did nothing for her profits. But now a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Centre and e-commerce company Flipkart to sell products opens up the market for rural women like Anandhi.

The collaboration will be instrumental in turning small-time artisans into entrepreneurs by expanding their customer base, and helping them with the skills of digital marketing, financial management and branding. Under the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) by the union ministry of housing and urban affairs, the Tamil Nadu government has decided to begin the online initiative with a few SHGs in the western districts of Coimbatore, Nilgiris, Erode and Tirupur.

""We have planned to identify around 25 products produced by SHGs in each district as of now. The products of the SHGs could be found in the Flipkart website within a couple of months,"" said a senior government official. The training programme for the members of SHG groups began in Coimbatore on Monday where makers were introduced to the idea of online trade. Sirumugai silk saris, traditional Toda embroidered shawls, jute bags, products made of upcycled paper and herbal products, are among the selected items which will be put up for sale under the Tamil Nadu Urban Livelihood Mission (TNULM).

For most rural women making a living out of handicrafts, mounting debts are a constant battle. Till a few years ago, Anandhi got just Rs200 for every sari she wove. After becoming part of SHG, though bank loans made it easier, sale of products was still an issue. ""Competing with cheaper powerloom versions, our handloom saris priced from Rs5,500 onwards did not have many takers in the local market. So our sale would be limited and we could make only Rs500 to Rs1,200 per piece,"" said Anandhi, who hopes the online initiative will help her reap a good profit for the soft and lustrous Sirumugai silks.

Eliminating hurdles in conventional sales and marketing, the move is expected to widen the market for the SHGs, said the official. ""The wider market would increase the product demand and so higher income,"" he said.

Partnering with local artisans, weavers and crafts producers, Flipkart under its ‘Samarth’ initiative has been working to provide underserved, domestic communities and businesses an access to the national market. ""The initiative would enable sellers to overcome geographical and socio-economic constraints by leveraging the Flipkart platform to reach more than 200 million customers across India,"" said a Flipkart spokesperson over e-mail. Last month the e-commerce firm tied up with the Gujarat State Handloom and Handicrafts Development Corporation to take the work of craftsmen online. Flipkart representatives will also set a standard of quality and help artisans fix a price for the products after doing a market analysis. For instance, a group from Nilgiris is producing cups, baskets and bowls made of waste paper. Even though the products are sold for Rs500 in the market, the members are selling them for Rs200 to the middlemen.

Excited about the shift, K Udhayaselvi, 53, of Pasumai SHG, said, her group members have decided to double the number of kurtis they stitch, once their products go online. But she also hopes to get assistance for designs based on the market trend. ""Without much exposure, we are unaware of market trends and tastes,"" she said. Expressing similar concern, V Jayalakshmi of Poonthalir SHG, said, ""I may have to ensure better quality of products. But, I would definitely need support from the government,"" she said.

Much ahead of the government push, some like Avila Juliet, an SHG member, had already begun selling online. ""It did not just introduce SHG members to a different customer base but also increased sales and motivated us to innovate the products."" Avila, who has been making products out of coconut shells now exports to customers in Japan, Saudi Arabia and the US.

To keep up with the competition online products need a USP, said D Swamikannan , professor and head of department of environmental economics, Madurai Kamaraj University. ""As the SHGs have been limited to local markets and concentrate on making just enough to meet their daily expenses, the best bet would be to focus on indigenous handmade products that not easily available to catch people’s attention,"" he said.

From top business executives who lead the world’s biggest companies to champion sportspersons to prime ministers and world-class cuisine, the city of Hyderabad has given a lot to the country and the world.

But there are some Good Samaritans from Hyderabad who believe in giving back to the city that has nurtured and nourished them. They help out the needy without expecting anything in return.

We at The Times of India have decided to honour these do-gooders with a special initiative called ‘Times Hyderabad Heroes ’.

Launched in association with Freedom Healthy Cooking Oil, the initiative seeks to highlight the work of people who have taken it upon themselves to give back to society without expecting anything in return.

The initiative starts from Tuesday. Hyderabadis can nominate people from the city who work for a good cause, whether big or small, by logging on to www.hyderabadheroes.in. Nominations are welcome from any field, whether it is health, education, feeding the hungry or looking after stray animals. You can also log on and vote for the people you think deserve this honour. Your vote will play a big role in choosing our Heroes.

TOI has already profiled some of these heroes over the past few months. Like Samuel Karunakar and his wife Priyanka who have a food truck that feeds nearly 1,500 needy people at hospitals every Saturday. Or Urvashi Kundra who left her six-figure IT job in 2017 to help women deal with menstrual health.

A jury of prominent citizens from the city would assess the nominees and come up with a final list. Following this, the Good Samaritans would be profiled in the newspaper.

Allahabad: The Allahabad high court on Monday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct an enquiry in the matter of misappropriation of public fund in Bulandshahr land acquisition scam .

In February 1991, a notification was issued for acquisition of about 969 acre land by UPSIDC for industrial development. The Special Land Development Officer had determined Rs 2,87,14,996 as compensation. On reference court increased the amount to Rs 7,13,37,504.

However, certain farmers did not hand over their possession. Subsequently, UPSIDC entered into an agreement with Tehri Hydro Development Corporation in 2013 to transfer land and in this process authorities increased compensation to Rs 3,87,17,71,833 — enhancement of Rs 380 crores under ex gratia compensation though farmers had already been paid.

Directing the CBI to investigate the matter, a division bench comprising Justice Sudhir Agarwal and Justice Saurabh Shyam Shamshery observed, “In the present case, all the facts are glaring. The top officials on their own had decided to pay ex gratia compensation, which was known to them to be illegal. In this case, state police would not be able to investigate fairly and we are of the considered view that in order to unearth truth, present matter should be referred to CBI for investigation”.

The court was hearing the writ petitions filed by farmer Kamal Singh and others. The court directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary enquiry and register an FIR to unearth the scam and also submit the status report of investigation to this court in sealed cover after three months. The court fixed May 11, 2020 as the next date for hearing.

187,['11/02/2020'],Securing duplicate school marksheets a herculean task,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Madurai: Obtaining one’s lost school education certificates, especially the SSLC and higher secondary mark sheets, have become a herculean task in the state. Neither the local education department officials nor the online website is apparently of much help.

Recently, Karthik (name changed), who had completed his higher secondary examination nearly a decade ago, found that he had lost his file and bag containing all the originals of his school education certificates. Panicking, he rushed to the chief education officer’s office in Madurai. “From what I know, you have to pay a challan for a specified amount at the treasury, attach a missing certificate and send it to the department, but you may get a better idea from the people selling forms for certificates outside the district collectorate,” said one of the staff there.

Those selling forms for certificates outside the district collectorate are not recognised persons. Kavitha (name changed), who was also trying to get a duplicate SSLC mark sheet, said that a man outside the collectorate offered to give her a printed application form and also helped in filling it for Rs 200. “However, he said he would only help fill the form and did not give me much information about the whole process so it is difficult to know who to go to,” she said.

After finding the information he got from the CEO’s office confusing, Karthik rushed to another officer of higher ranking. “Oh everything is online and you will not have to do anything manually, so just go on the school education site,” he said. The desperate candidate found that only the application form for a duplicate certificate was available online, and it had to be downloaded and filled up to start the process.

The application form says, you should pay Rs 505, at the treasury, get a missing certificate duly signed by a gazetted officer, an affidavit signed by a notary public and a missing notice published in a newspaper to be duly submitted with the application. But all this have to be submitted only after getting a copy of the FIR from the police, in the limits of which the documents were lost. “This is the easiest part of the entire process, thanks to the e-seva website of the Tamil Nadu police, where you can get a lost document report by logging into the site and a payment of Rs 50 for each document lost,” he said.

Next is to get the affidavit signed by the notary. The affidavit needs to be printed on a Rs 20-stamp paper, and the numerous shops near the collectorate type the affidavit and get it signed from a notary public for a payment of Rs 500, if you go in person and have authentication to prove your claim. A Notary public will sign the certificate only if the Lost Document Report from the police is furnished.

Armed with these two certificates, you have to go to a local newspaper for publishing the notice for a payment that may range between Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,500. When it appears in the newspaper, you have to approach the government treasury.

The person at the treasury would not be very helpful if you do not produce the last part of the application form downloaded from the website, which has details of the challan and fees to be paid. He will only put his seal and signature on the challan, but the money has to be deposited in the specified branch of the State Bank of India. Here the bank officer will give you the receipt and challan number, which have to be kept carefully to file with the application.

Further, you need the signature of a gazetted officer or Tahsildar vouching for the missing mark sheets on a certificate that you can obtain from agents outside the collectorate premises. “Going to the Tahsildar’s office to get the signature was difficult and time consuming. Already we had to keep running from one office to the other during the process,” said Rajesh (name changed), who recently applied for a duplicate higher secondary mark sheet. Finally, the application form downloaded from the directorate of government examinations has to be filled up carefully and taken to the school where the candidate studied, where the principal or headmaster would authorise it at their convenience.

Though the application form says the school would forward the application to the department of examinations, it is often the candidate who is forced to do it, said the applicants. Then, he/she has to keep their fingers crossed and wait for the certificate for a period of at least two months. Both schools and education department officials said that they get only few applications every year. “We hardly get even 10 applications in a year sometimes. So, that is also again a reason why many are not aware of the processes, which keep changing as well. Many don’t even bother applying unless they desperately need it for a job or such,” said the principal of a private school.

HYDERABAD : Telangana has the third-highest incidence of depressive disorders after Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh , a new study published in The Lancet Public Health journal has estimated after analysing cases over 27 years. Each of the three states also reported over 3,760 people with depressive disorders per 10,000 population.As per the report titled, ‘The burden of mental disorders across the states of India: The Global Burden of Disease Study 1990–2017’, India had about 197·3 million people suffering from mental disorders. While Telangana also has the third-highest incidence of anxiety disorders among 45·7 million people with depressive disorders and 44·9 million with anxiety disorders in the country.“The higher prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders in southern states could be related to higher levels of modernisation and urbanisation apart from other factors that are not yet well understood,” said the study funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , Indian Council of Medical Research, department of health research and the Union ministry of health and family welfare.The report revealed that in 2017, one among every seven people in India had a mental disorder, ranging from mild to severe. The prevalence of mental disorders that manifest predominantly during adulthood was generally higher in the more developed southern states than in the less developed northern states.Whereas the prevalence of mental disorders with onset predominantly in childhood and adolescence was generally higher in the less developed northern states, the study pointed out.Also the number of years lost to disability known as Crude DALY (disability-adjusted life-year) was found to be high in the south.“The crude DALY rate of depressive disorders varied 2.1 times between the states in 2017 and was highest in Tamil Nadu of high Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) state group, followed by Telangana and Andhra Pradesh of the middle SDI state group, and Odisha of the low SDI state group.“It is also important to note that the high prevalence of depression among older adults has substantial implications because the population in India is ageing rapidly,” the report stated.Eating disorders were the only mental disorders in Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 to which deaths could be attributed directly. “A significantly higher prevalence of eating disorders in females than in males has been reported elsewhere and, apart from genetic and biological factors, it is also probably linked with socio-cultural, media and peer pressure on diet,” the report said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74074804,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-72623,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-has-3rd-most-cases-of-mental-disorders-among-states-report/articleshow/74071580.cms

190,['11/02/2020'],Women protesters resume agitation against CAA at Mohammad Ali Park,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Kanpur: Two days after the anti-CAA protesters called off their sit-in and vacated the Mohammad Ali Park in Chamanganj area of the city, scores of women protesters, allegedly from the other faction, on late Sunday night, assembled at the same place and staged a sit-in against the CAA.

Locals of the area, however, said that there was a tension in the area when police, on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday, arrived at the spot and started forcibly removing the protesters from the park. However, the women, instead of leaving the spot, started staging a road blockade at the nearby Inspector Road and demanded that they are allowed to hold demonstration inside the park to raise their voice against the CAA and NRC.

Later, more protestors, including men and women, joined and the number soon swelled into several thousand.

In order to avoid any kind of backlash, the district administration requisitioned more police force but the protesters refused to lift the road blockade even after repeatedly being warned of strict police action, said eyewitnesses. Sensing the gravity of the situation, police later allowed the demonstrators to resume their sit-in at the Mohammad Ali Park.

The women have been staging the sit-in at Mohammad Ali Park in Chamanganj and Tikuniya Park at Babupurwa since January 7 and January 19, respectively, to demand rollback of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The protesters at both the sites had called off their sit-in after submitting a memorandum to the district and police authorities after getting an assurance from the administration on Saturday that it would withdraw the cases lodged as part of preventive action against them.

Many protesters at Mohammad Ali Park, however, stayed back, said, eyewitnesses.

“Police, on coming to know about the sit-in, rushed to the spot and asked the protesters to vacate the park on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday. When the protesters refused to budge, the cops at around 4.30 am on Monday, forcibly removed them. The protesters, however, returned later in the day,” they added.

The district and police officials told them that they have instructions not to allow people to stage protests there as the prohibitory orders were in force.

Meanwhile, the women protesters, staging a road blockade, alleged that the district administration and police have done this to prevent people from voicing their opinion against CAA and NRC which discriminate on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution.

DIG Anant Deo, however, claimed that a different faction of women has started the protest on Sunday.

“They are being instigated by some outsiders. We will investigate and locate thosewho are instigating the protesters,” the DIG added.

To recall, last Thursday, the district administration had slapped notices on 66 residents of Chamanganj area to sign security bonds of Rs 2 lakh for maintaining law and order at Mohammad Ali Park where women protesters have dug in their heels.

The notices were issued to them under Section 107/117 of the CrPC which empowers a magistrate to direct a person to furnish security bonds pending an inquiry.

This tournament may find a fixed place in yearly schedule

Vadodara: The thriving school cricket culture in the city has been instrumental in giving international cricketers like Anshuman Gaekwad, Kiran More , Nayan Mongia , Atul Bedade and many more first-class players.

The Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) management that had been ignoring school cricket over last few years seems to have realized the importance of this tournament.

The association on Monday announced that organizing Maharani Shantadevi Inter School Tournament which will start from Tuesday in the city. It is after a gap of five years that the tournament is being played in the city. The last time the tournament was played in 2015. “We had to stop the tournament as it wasn’t getting place in the other BCCI as well as local cricket tournaments. We were not having enough dates to play this tournament,” said Satyajit Gaekwad, chairman of BCA’s press and publicity committee.

The association was also facing criticism for sidestepping school cricket and promoting club cricket for years. “BCA had been getting talented players from school cricket, so we decided to start it again. It will give good opportunity to young players,” said Pranav Amin, BCA president.

A total of 16 school teams will play in the group of four groups. All the matches will be played as per one day rules.

When asked if the tournament will have a permanent place in BCA’s cricket calendar, Amin said, “We are preparing an elaborate calendar of cricket tournaments for every season. This tournament will have a fixed schedule every year,” Amin added.

The association is planning to look for sponsors for this tourney that took off in 1990s. BCA will also organize district level school tournaments on the grounds there.

New coach to be picked

After Ranji coach Sanath Kumar suffered brain stroke last month, former India pacer Munaf Patel is playing the dual role of Ranji team’s coach as well as mentor. Playing without a full time coach, Baroda team crashed out of the Ranji Trophy due to performance as well as selection issue. The association is planning to rope in a new coach for the next season.

The BCA has received nearly 200 applications for the post of CEO. BCA president, Pranav Amin said that they have zeroed in on 30 to 40 applications out of which three to five candidates will be short-listed. Sources in the BCA said that one of the strong contenders has demanded unreasonably high salary for the job.

Forest officials have sent the body for postmortem and asked farmers to fence their fields. Mehra said that the family will be compensated with Rs 5 lakh, which is the norm in case of elephant-related deaths.

Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation removed 62,340 unauthorised hoardings and banners over the last few months following repeated orders by the high court calling for stringent action. It also levied penalties to the tune of Rs 10.29 lakh, the highest among civic bodies in the state. Kollam corporation removed 7,343 unauthorised hoardings and stood second in terms of fines levied, at Rs 7.92 lakh, according to data presented to the assembly.

The revenue wing of the city corporation has of late been dealing with undue pressure from political parties and organisations in its drive against hoardings. On Friday, things took an ugly turn after a revenue team was confronted by an organisation over removal of boards, banners and festoons which were arranged for a state conference. The matter escalated as the revenue wing was reportedly asked by corporation authorities to re-install the boards. Officials says that they are demoralised by such actions as they are caught between the legal obligation to comply with the court directive and pressure from political parties, organisations and sometimes from even within the ruling council.

The high court had recently directed local bodies to remove illegal hoardings , banners, boards erected on footpaths and roadside within 15 days. The local self-government department (LSGD) also issued a new set of guidelines in the wake of the court order. T Mithra, additional secretary with LSGD, directed local bodies to levy fines and initiate revenue recovery against violators.

According to the LSGD directive, the boards erected in violation of norms are not to be dumped in public waste management facilities and that their disposal will be the responsibility of violators. The licence of agencies which put up the unauthorised boards are to be cancelled and local body secretaries have been asked not to reissue licences to such agencies.

Between October 2018 and June 2019, the city corporation removed 37,368 boards, banners and flags and levied Rs 8.72 lakh in penalties. The civic body also filed complaints with the city police against repeat offenders and 12 FIRs have been registered.

Following the latest court order, corporation secretary has directed that FIRs be registered and criminal action be initiated against repeat violators. A penalty in the range of Rs 2,500-Rs 10,000 will also be levied. This is being done based on the court order which says that if any unauthorised board/banner/flag/hoarding is detected and consequentially removed and returned to the person or a group, an appropriate criminal case under IPC or Highway Act or under Police Act may be charged and registered against the persons or entities responsible.

199,['11/02/2020'],Goods driver sets example byplanting saplings on median,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Udupi: To make a beautiful garden, one doesn’t need land, but have the willingness to make the environment green. Zafar Saheb from Shirva is a case in point. This goods driver spends spare time to beautify his garden which is actually a road median, by planting saplings of flowering plants and crotons.

He feels people are aware of the need for green around them but the real challenge is watering the plants and nurturing them.

Zafar Saheb, 60, said: “Business has been dull for over a year. So, most of the time, I spend in the vehicle stand. I then thought of beautifying the median. Gardening is my hobby and I have a garden at home. When Shirva Main Road tarring was done, there was place for a divider and I filled it with soil for a 300-metre stretch and planted some plants from my garden.”

Zafar, who has studied up to SSLC, came up with a unique technique to water the plants. He picked waste bottles, opened the bottom part and made some holes in the cap and fixed it on the soil near the plants. He just needs to fill the bottle in the morning and water drips from the bottle directly to the plant through the day. “This system provides sufficient water for the plants and uses less water,” he said.

He added, “We have a Tempo stand on one side of the road, and an autorickshaw stand on the other side. We all water the plants. Initially, some were sceptical about about it, but now all appreciate it and come up with suggestions. Some get water and others get plants. The Mahila Mandal near the stand gives water every day. Some people keep water in a can near the Tempo stand. Though it was not a planned project, it makes me happy that all support me in it.”

An inspiration to others

“We spend a lot of time on the road. It should be our aim that our roads should be as beautiful as our homes,” he said.

He added: “This monsoon, I have to take out the soil and remove the tar from the median so that the plants grow nicely. I want to expand it up to a 1-km stretch and want others to also plant saplings on medians and make our city beautiful.”

Berhampur: Sunday’s accident in which 10 people lost their lives after the bus they were travelling in came into contact with a low-hanging high-tension wire in Ganjam district has sparked a blame game between power distribution company Southco Utility and the state rural development department.

The accident, which took place at Mandrajpur under Ganjam district’s Golanthara police station limits, left 18 people injured.

A senior Southco officer said they had written to the executive engineer of the rural development division (Ganjam) for permission to move electric poles from the middle of the road at Mandarajpur to one side.

The poles were ended up being smack on the road after it was widened a while ago.

“On July 4, 2018, we asked the department to deposit Rs 4 lakh towards shifting of the electric poles. The executive engineer of the rural development department, however, did not pay the money,” said chief operating officer of Southco, Arun Kumar.

The executive engineer of rural development (Ganjam), P K Jena, contested the charges and said Southco had only provided an estimate of the money needed to move the poles away from the road.

“It did not tell us about the danger posed by the wires. It also did not pursue the matter,” Jena said. He added that the incident could have been avoided had the live wire, which had sagged, been tightened on time.

Locals, however, continued to blame the power distribution company for the accident. They said they had repeatedly drawn Southco’s attention to the low-hanging wires, but their complaints were never addressed. “As it is the KV lines are very low. Now, even the poles are on the road after it was widened by the rural development department,” said Ch. Sudhakar Reddy, sarpanch of Ekasingh.

On Monday, the state government suspended four engineers from these two departments for negligence. Besides, regional transport officer (Ganjam), Sanjay Kumar Biswal, submitted to the collector the report of a preliminary inquiry held by additional RTO K Venketesh and motor vehicle inspector Santanu Kumar Parida.

Biswal also issued a challan of Rs 15,000 against the owner of the bus for plying the route without permission.

“The bus was in good condition but it had not taken permission to run on this route. The vehicle has a permit to run from Hinjili to Cuttack, via Berhampur,” said Biswal.

He added that the accident took place because of the negligence of the driver and that he had recommended the suspension of his driving licence for three months.

202,['11/02/2020'],This techie is a go-to crowdfunder for needy patients,"This story is from February 11, 2020

MANGALURU: Five months, 27 fundraisers for needy patients, 1,500 donors and counting, and Rs 40 lakh collected so far. This is probably not on Arjun Bhandarkar’s CV but the 31-year-old software engineer is now a trusted name in crowdfunding for medical emergencies, with his heart in the right place and the logistics to boot.

Arjun’s foray into crowd-sourcing was triggered by a family emergency when his father was hospitalised. “Though we had sufficient insurance cover and resources at hand, we had to struggle to make immediate arrangements,” he recalls. “That got me thinking. If we, who had good jobs and were earning well, faced difficulties in rustling up funds, what about those who don’t have the wherewithal?”

Having worked for eight years with a private firm after completing his BE in information science, the techie felt this was an opportunity to try something new on the side. “I thought a lot and decided to help six patients a year by collecting just Rs 100 each from donors I could find. I began searching within my circle and while I was happy to pool together Rs 10,000 for a family, my friends and I managed to raise more than Rs 2.5 lakh,” says Arjun.

Arjun’s parents, wife and his sister who has a daughter, stood by him in his new venture. The initial days were tough and at times disappointing, he says, as not many people knew him or were willing to loosen their purse strings for him. “I had to reach out to more than 1,000 people to raise enough money to help one family,” he recalls. But case by case, Arjun built his credibility. “Most such messages for help circulated on WhatsApp or Facebook do not provide even 10% information about the family’s situation or the details of treatment. The more information one provides, the more credible the case will be.”

Bit by bit, word got around and Arjun’s appeals began to draw a robust response. He has raised Rs 40 lakh so far for 27 families and in January, floated an emergency fund that could be used to help patients right away without waiting for a crowdfunding campaign. “We have provided Rs 25,000 each to two families through this fund which they used for hospital admission charges,” Arjun says. “The lowest donation in my campaigns so far has been Re 1 and the highest has been Rs 50,000.”

The last campaign Arjun launched was for Sahana Pai, a breast cancer patient. “Cancer patients are in need of substantial amounts for treatment, accident victims need help to rebuild their lives and families in either situation need money to meet immediate or long-term expenses. We take up all such appeals,” says Arjun.

Recently, he has been working with GSB Charitable Trust which refers potential fundraisers to him. “The fund targets are planned in such a manner that they help the beneficiary meet a portion of the treatment cost,” he says, adding that has met the target successfully barring a couple of instances.

“We have more than 1,500 donors who have helped one or more families. I reach out to them via WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and email as the last resort,” says Arjun. “The challenge is to enlarge this list. We have launched an initiative where donors can pledge money on special occasions such as birthdays or anniversaries. This has been welcomed by many,” he says.

Arjun runs a Facebook page, ‘Help to save a life: Lend a helping hand’, and personally drafts the fundraiser petition. “Since this is my initiative, I personally make sure that the causes are verified. And I always provide the full details,” he says. “I also try my utmost to get the donors to meet the families and hand over their contribution so they know where their money is going. I don’t get into it unless I have to.”

203,['11/02/2020'],"Hyderabad: Duty-free liquor on sale, gangs get rich while government loses tax","This story is from February 11, 2020

Police present the seized liquor and the arrested duo before media

HYDERABAD: For smugglers, duty-free foreign liquor is as good as gold. They piggyback on international fliers to legally buy imported foreign liquor from duty-free shop at RGI Airport , then illegally sell it to local customers at a price lower than government-mandated rates for foreign brands at retail liquor stores. While the profit is neat for smugglers, the revenue loss for state is steep. In less than a fortnight, excise officials have seized 254 foreign liquor bottles worth Rs 30 lakh from gangs operating in the city.

International passengers can buy duty-free liquor for personal consumption by producing a flight ticket and passport. “But selling duty-free liquor is illegal,” an excise official said.

With the modus operandi of the fraudsters coming to light, excise officials caught T Venkatesh (55) of Chikkadpally twice in four months.

Venkatesh, who operated a departmental store in the US for over a decade, has been supplying foreign liquor to parties in the city for the past few years. “He has been supplying lakhs of rupees worth of foreign liquor to clients. At the time of his arrest, we seized 171 foreign liquor bottles from him and his two aides,” an excise official said.

Blue Label and Royal Salute whiskies seem to be the favourite brands of the gangs. According to excise sleuths, state government sells 750 ml bottles of the two imported brands for Rs 22,000 and Rs 21,000 respectively at retail liquor shops. But on the other hand, at a duty-free shop fliers (carriers for smugglers) can buy a litre of the same brands between Rs 13,000 and Rs 14,000, which is sourced by Venkatesh and then sold to clients for Rs 18,000 to Rs 19,000.

“Customers get a litre of imported alcohol for price lesser than a 750-ml bottle in the market. It is a win-win situation for both the supplier and the customer,” an excise official said.

Venkatesh was found to be procuring duty-free liquor from Chennai-based Doraisingam and Phaneendra Babu . In addition to the Chennai suppliers, Venkatesh also had contacts at the duty-free shop at RGI Airport, operated by GMR Hospitality and Retail Limited, officials said.

“Passengers who go to Malaysia to buy electronic goods such as camera lenses and LED TVs are being used by Venkatesh to bring duty-free liquor from Hyderabad airport. He used to give money to one Khaled, working at Hyderabad duty-free shop, and his former assistant Anil. They scan passports of passengers from Malaysia and send duty-free liquor out with them. Venkatesh collects the liquor outside the airport,” assistant excise superintendent N Anji Reddy said.

Deputy commissioner C Vivekananda Reddy said that in the past two weeks their teams had arrested six persons, including Venkatesh, two RGI Airport duty-free shop workers, a havildar of central GST, who used to work at the airport, and a Mumbai-based foreign liquor supplier belonging to three gangs.

“We strongly condemn such cases. We have a zero-tolerance policy against such misdemeanours. Based on prima facie information, we have already suspended the employee in question and we are conducting a thorough investigation from our side,” a spokesperson of GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited (GHIAL), which operates RGI Airport at Shamshabad, said.

Indore: Five days after Manawar mob lynching that claimed life of a person, Dhar police on Monday nabbed eight more suspects in connection with the case, taking the number of arrests to 19.

Following the gruesome mob attack at Borlai village of Manawar tehsil in Dhar district on February 5, police had identified three main suspects and 15-20 others.

Dhar SP Aditya Pratap Singh said: “Preliminary investigation reveals that labourers - Bhuvan Singh and Avtar- who owed the money of the victims, were main conspirators as they spread rumour of child lifting by making phone calls to local villagers. The duo is still on the run.”

Earlier, a local BJP leader, who was arrested in the case, was alleged to be the kingpin of the violence.

Relentless raids by police teams are on in nearby jungles and suspected hideouts for people, who are on the run after their name surfaced in the crime based on video footage and photographs of the spot, Singh said.

The incident has triggered political storm in Madhya Pradesh. On Monday morning, health minister Tulsiram Silawat contacted Dhar collector Shrikanth Banoth and SP on phone and took stock of the ongoing investigation and arrests made in the case.

Earlier, Silawat had visited the survivors — Jagdish Radheshyam Sharma, 45, Vinod Tulsiram Mukati, 43, Ravi Patel, 38, and Jagdish Poonamchand Sharma — at Choithram Hospital, and announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the family of Ganesh, who was killed in the brutal attack.

Meanwhile, members of Khati community of Borlai and Khirkiya villages led by their national president Manoharlal Mandloi met the SP and handed over a memorandum to register their protest. The community national secretary Mishrilal Choudhary demanded action against cops for their negligence in controlling the mob. They also demanded compensation of Rs 50 lakh to next kin of the deceased and other victims.

Berhampur: After losing their father, two teenage sisters of Dankalpadu village were being brought up by their mother, who doubled up as father. But the cruel fate snatched away that lifeline too.

They have become orphan after their mother along with nine others was electrocuted in the bus in which they were travelling came in contact with a sagging live wire at Mandarajpur in Ganjam district on Sunday.

B Dropadi, 15, and her sister B Jyostna, 13, had lost their father 10 years ago due to snakebite. On Sunday, their mother B Pappama, 38, died. To add to the siblings’ woes, they will have to look after an 80-year-old ailing grandmother too.

“My mother was eking out a living by working as a daily-wage labourer. I don’t know how we could maintain the family,” said Dropadi, who studies in Class X. Her sister is in Class VIII in the local school. Dropadi and her sister survived as both of them refused to attend the ring ceremony of a youth of their village.

“Our mother died 15 minutes after her departure,’ said Dropadi as tears rolled down her cheeks.

One of their relatives said the government needs to adopt these poor sisters like it did to orphaned children in Gajapati district after they lost their parents in the severe cyclone Titli. The government has announced Rs 2 lakh to the kin of each of the deceased in the bus mishap. “Rs 2 lakh is not sufficient to bring up the two teenage girls. The government should adopt them and take care of their ailing grandmother,” said N Damburu Reddy, a villager.

Eerie silence prevailed in Dankalpadu a day after the incident as eight persons of the village were electrocuted. Some of the women of the village were seen serving cooked food to the family members of the deceased.

Similarly two sisters — K Sandhya, 30, and K Mohini, 35 — died in the accident. These two married women had come to the village to attend their bother Ashok Reddy’s ring ceremony. “On my request they came in the morning of Sunday. Like others, they were also going to attend the ring ceremony,” said 26-year old Ashok, who stayed back in his house.

Ujjain/Bhopal: BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya on Monday accused chief minister Kamal Nath of trying to “divide tribals”, triggering a stinging retort from Congress, which said people of Ujjain have already given him their answer by boycotting his rally.

Leading a march to demand a “clear passage” for pilgrims to Mahakaal temple. He claimed Nath won’t be able to continue in office if he tries to stop 2021 census enumerators from marking tribals as Hindus.

Claiming that CM Kamal Nath had warned of action against officials “if any of them allowed tribals to call themselves Hindus in the Census”, Vijayvargiya said: “Kamal Nathji’s statement will create a new problem in Madhya Pradesh and the country. This is a dangerous, poisonous statement. Kamal Nathji is trying to trying to divide society. Till now attempts were made to create divisions between Hindus and Muslims. Now it is tribals, and that too for votebank politics.”

Tribals have been a part of Hindu community since the age of Lord Rama, he insisted. “Kamal Nath ji, if you try to take action against officials, you will not be able to remain chief minister. Census is carried out by the central government not state,” he said.

The state Congress hit back hard, with PCC spokesman and chief minister’s media convener Narendra Saluja saying, “Kailash Vijayvargiya, who had threatened to set Indore on fire, went to Ujjain temple on Monday and tried to disturb peace and amity there.”

“People of Ujjain gave a befitting reply to Vijayvargiya by boycotting his public meeting. Despite false claims by BJP leaders, including former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and BJP state president Rakesh Singh, people kept away from BJP’s protest,” Saluja said.

“Vijayvargiya has challenged Kamal Nath once again, forgetting that during the state government’s campaign against mafia, he had thrown a similar challenge. He knows what happened after that. Fearing defeat, Vijayvargiya ran away from Mhow and did not contest the assembly elections. Instead, he helped his son Akash Vijayvargiya win from Indore-3, the only seat BJP could win in the entire Indore division,” Saluja added.

Vijayvargiya led the rally to ask the district administration to clear a road in Begam Bag area of anti-CAA protesters as it leads to Mahakaal temple. Vijayvargiya claimed the protest was blocking pilgrims from visiting the temple. “If the road is not cleared before Maha Shivratri (February 21), BJP will stage 101 protests,” he said.

Kendrapada/Balasore: Close on heels of their visits to different temples and subsequent announcement of packages for the development of the shrines, chief secretary Asit Tripathy and 5T secretary V K Pandian, among other senior officers, visited Talasari beach in Balasore district and Bhitarkanika National Park in Kendrapada district on Monday to tap tourism potential of the two destinations.

The state government is likely to come out with packages to develop the two destinations, said an official. The officials are scheduled to give a presentation of the proposed development plans of the two places before the chief minister Naveen Patnaik soon.

They discussed with the senior officials and others to promote ecotourism in Bhitarkanika and Gahiramatha marine sanctuary to attract more tourists to both the places.

The officials said ecotourism as an activity will create employment opportunities for many villagers around Bhitarkanika National Park. It is essential to make sure that growth and development of ecotourism sector is sustainable, socially responsible and creates decent job opportunities. “Ecotourism in Bhitarkanika is a big employment generator and has a multiplier impact on the economy. It is a major contributor to employment, particularly for women and youths, fishermen, boatmen and others. Ecotourism can lead to the alleviation of poverty and boost socio-economic development,” said Bikash Ranjan Dash, divisional forest officer (DFO) of the park.

The state government decided to promote ecotourism in Bhitarkanika as it has potential for adventure tourism. Villagers around the national park would earn more money in the process by extending homely hospitality to the tourists who each winter visit Bhitarkanika.

Ecotourism projects will act as the window to the treasure trove of natural resources in forests and the authorities directed the forest officials to promote ecotourism on a large scale, added Dash.

The water bodies of the park are home to around 1,700 salt-water crocodiles. It is also abode to birds, spotted deer, snakes and water monitors.

208,['11/02/2020'],Cashless service at Kaduru GP great success,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Udupi: Cashless transactions, introduced at Kaduru gram panchayat as a pilot project in 2018-19, is a big hit. Following its success, the government has ordered implementation of the same at 158 GPs in the district. It will later be extended to all GPs spread across the state.

For the record, Kaduru GP is also the recipient of Sansad Adharsh Gram Award. Srinivas Rao, chief planning officer of the zilla panchayat, said: “UDMA Technology has introduced a software, under which people can make cashless transaction even in the absence of internet. The app enables people to use any language of their choice. Villagers not having smartphones have the option to transact through their phones.”

The pilot project has collected 78% of the tax online from the GP. Through the app, transactions with regard to collecting house and other tax, water and electricity bills, and solid-liquid resource management (SLRM) changes can be made. The district administration has submitted a report on the same to state government. Based on the report findings, the government consented to extend the project to all GPs in district. The same will be implemented in stagewise, he added.

Mahesh, panchayat development officer of Kaduru GP, said former DC Priyanka Mary Francis had referred Kaduru for the cashless transactions project. The GP comprises Kaduru and Naduru villages having 1,106 houses. Of them, 780 households had paid taxes online last year.

UDMA technology had launched the software ‘Yuva Pay’ for cashless transactions. The currently available online app charges 2-3% of the amount. However, the company collects only 0.5%. Also, cashless transaction is not made mandatory here. People could also pay taxes/ bills by personally at the panchayat office or at some shops.

Though the system does not need internet or smartphone, the transactions need a mobile network to happen. But many places in these villages do not have network due to the absence of mobile towers. “Also, an online payment receipt is not considered as a valid proof for payment. So we need to distribute the receipts though bill collectors,” he added.

In the next phase, cashless transactions will be extended to GPs covering Aruru, Kukehalli, Cherkadi, Inanje, Kumbashi, Thekkatte, Hosadu, Trasi, Maravathe, Vandse, Warranga, Erlapadi, Bailuru and others.

209,['11/02/2020'],BJP and Cong pooh-pooh exit poll results,"This story is from February 11, 2020

New Delhi: In the next few hours, the fate of 672 candidates — 593 men and 79 women — in the electoral fray for 70 seats in Delhi Assembly would be known. Though the contest to form a government in Delhi is largely seen to be between the party in power, AAP , and BJP , Congress may emerge as a dark horse and upset calculations.

Counting of votes will begin at 8am and which party gets the mandate to govern Delhi for the next five years will be known by 2pm.

Stakes are high for the three political parties that ran a campaign for almost a fortnight before the votes were polled on February 8. Victory of AAP will validate its claims of doing good work in education, health and power sectors while looking after the vulnerable sections through free power, water and travel for women in public transport.

Bharatiya Janata Party, which had been extremely critical of the five years of the Aam Aadmi Party government in the capital, made the work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government its election plank to woo voters apart from focussing on national issues such as abrogation of Article 370 and 35A in Kashmir, citizenship amendment law and protests against, a favourable judgment in the Ram Temple case and surgical strikes on Pakistan.

The party, which is looking to form a government in Delhi after 22 years in exile, ran an aggressive campaign with Union home minister Amit Shah micro-managing everything on a day-to-day basis. Senior BJP functionaries, including several Union ministers and MPs from across the country, addressed close to 10,000 public meetings during the fortnight-long campaign, banking on planks of Hindutva and nationalism.

Congress, on the other hand, made the legacy of the Sheila Dikshit government and infrastructure development during 1998-2013 when it was in power its main poll plank. Several senior Congress functionaries, including former party president Rahul Gandhi, AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and chief ministers of four states held public events in the last week of electioneering.

The exit polls telecast by various TV channels have predicted a comfortable victory for AAP by giving it 44-68 seats in the 70-member House. In the 2015 assembly polls, AAP had won a record 67 seats and polled over 54% votes. BJP, which got over 32% votes in the last election, had won just three seats while Congress was decimated with a vote share of less than 10% and no seat. Most exit polls have predicted around 10-12 seats for the BJP, marginally better over the last assembly poll results and none for Congress.

Both BJP and Congress have rubbished the exit poll results. BJP leaders exuded confidence “based on a micro analysis of all seats. The exit polls are rough estimates, and I am confident that BJP will form the government in Delhi with full majority,” said Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari, adding that they would win 45 of the 70 seats. Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra said the “actual” results would surprise everyone.

RAJAHMUNDRY: Rajahmundry city MLA and TDP leader Adireddi Bhavani on Monday lodged a complaint at the Disha police station here, alleging that derogatory remarks were directed at her on social media .

The comments were made following a speech by the MLA in the assembly on December 16, 2019 and later brought to the notice of the speaker.

Bhavani said she lodged a complaint when no action was taken, adding that no action has been taken against the culprits till date.

The legislator said people may lose faith in the Act and the police stations set up under it if investigation is delayed. Other TDP functionaries present at the police station claimed that the government had set up Disha police stations only in name. The police, they added, had said the case would not be investigated under the Act.

Rajahmundry (urban) additional SP K Latha Madhuri said as the case falls under the limits of the assembly secretariat, the police would proceed only after taking a legal opinion, adding that the complaint was lodged 53 days after the incident.

The additional SP said similar complaints were lodged by two women from Eluru in West Godavari and Amalapuram in East Godavari, which did not fall under their jurisdiction, but all three complaints were received and action initiated after taking a legal opinion. She added that police stations set up under it would be a driving force in curbing atrocities against women and children.

Bhubaneswar: The state government has decided to set up a burns unit at MKCG Medical College and Hospital, Berhampur, after nine passengers seriously burnt in the Ganjam bus tragedy had to be shifted to SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack, said health and family welfare minister Naba Kishore Das here on Monday.

At least 10 passengers died and 20 sustained injuries when a bus came in contact with a sagging 11KV live electricity wire near Mandrajpur village under Golanthara police limits in Ganjam district.

Though the injured patients were rushed to MKCG, they could not get treatment for burns due to lack of facilities. One patient died while being shifted to SCB. “People in southern Odisha depend upon MKCG but the government is yet to set up a burn unit at the premier hospital. It should be developed like SCB,” said Odisha Medical Services Association (OMSA) president Nirakar Bhatt. Medical superintendent of MKCG Santosh Kumar Misra said the hospital has already submitted a requirement for manpower and equipment to start the burn unit.

“We have a professor of plastic surgery. We need an associate professor, an assistant professor, three senior residents, four junior residents, 34 staff nurse, five technicians, laboratory attendants, class-IV employees and equipment to start the burn unit,” he added.

Koraput: By profession he is a teacher, but he is known better for his numerous short films, which have fetched him a number of awards. Meet Vishal Patnaik, 27, of Jeypore, a fine arts teacher in the government-run Adarsh Vidyalaya at Boipariguda, who has directed as many as 10 short films.

Patnaik’s films are known for their socially relevant content and use of local artists and locally available technology. His hard work has fetched him a number of state tele awards.

One of his shorts, ‘Chandalo’, won awards for best film and best actor at the 5th state tele awards in 2017. Another, ‘Pension’, depicting the struggle of the parents of a martyr in getting the pension due to them, received awards for best film, best story and best actor at the 7th state tele awards in 2019.

“In 2013, I made a short film titled ‘On a Sunday Evening’ just for fun. It was well received by viewers and it inspired me to make a second film,” said Patnaik.

Completely unaware of the nuances of film making, he surfed the internet to learn more. In a couple of years, Patnaik was successful in establishing himself as a well-known producer and director in the region.

At present, he is working on a short film titled ‘Maha Natak’, which depicts the slow death of theatre in the country. It will be released on World Theatre Day on March 27. “The aim of the film is to show how we are losing our identity under the influence of western culture,” said Patnaik.

Though producing and directing short films is not commercially profitable, the young filmmaker keeps at it simply to make a difference, and create awareness on social issues. “Depending on the needs of the script, I spend between Rs 10,000 and Rs 1.50 lakh on making each film. I have never thought much of the returns,” he Award-added.

KOLKATA : Airlines are planning to withhold checked-in bags containing power banks and other restricted items once the inline baggage screening system is commissioned between February 20 and 28 this year.The airlines will, however, issue a last minute warning to passengers when they drop their bags at the check-in counters.“If there is sufficient time between the inline screener flagging off a bag with a power bank and the flight’s departure, the airline will make an attempt to escort the passenger to the basement to open the bag and remove the restricted item. Otherwise, the bag will simply be held back. Under no circumstance a flight will be delayed to clear such a bag,” an airline official told TOI.The decision follows the bitter experience of airlines in Delhi and Mumbai two years ago when detection of a large number of power banks inside bags during inline screenning had led to massive flight hold-ups. “Till now, screeners at standalone X-ray machines ask passengers to remove restricted items from checked in bags before they are deposited at check-in counters. But once inline is commissioned, passengers will not get any prior warning,” said said the official. With Kolkata airport handling a larger number of first-time and infrequent flyers than Delhi or Mumbai, airline officials are worried low awareness on restricted items for checked-in baggage could many bags being flagged off when inline screening is in operation.To prevent flight delay, IndiGo — the largest carrier operating out of Kolkata with over 100 flights daily — plans to warn passengers at bag drop point (check-in counter) that their bags may be withheld if they contain a power bank. The airline asks passengers in Delhi and Mumbai to provide a declaration so that they are aware of the consequence.“We will paste stickers on the checked-in bags and on the reverse of the boarding card. We hope it will act as a final reminder for passengers to take the power bank out in case it is there. If a bag is withheld, the passenger will have to claim it later,” said an official of another airline. A senior airport official said they have also suggested the airlines to engage their staff to manually remind passengers during the initial days of the switch-over to ensure a seamless change into the inline system.The other major challenge in the migration to the new system is the need for baggage handlers to be disciplined.“In the run-up to the roll-out, we will undertake trial runs in the domestic as well as international wing to check the preparedness,” said an airport official.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74076692,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-140711,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bags-with-power-banks-run-risk-of-being-left-behind-warn-airlines/articleshow/74071612.cms

AHMEDABAD: In a major operation, officials of Ahmedabad customs booked 13 cases in the wee hours of Saturday, wherein 7.2kg smuggled gold was seized. This is the fourth case of gold seizure since January reported at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad and six persons have been arrested by Ahmedabad customs. According to customs officials, the seized gold was valued at Rs 3.06 crore.

“The incident took place in the wee hours of Saturday, wherein some 13 passengers coming from different destinations were booked from the SVPI airport. Most of them were from middle-eastern countries including Sharjah and Dubai in the UAE along with Doha in Qatar and Kuwait. Some passengers were also from Bangkok,” said a well-placed source.

The passengers belonged mainly to Kerala, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Three of these passengers were booked based on prior inputs whereas the rest were booked based on spot intelligence.

Upon investigation, it was found that multiple modus operandi were used to smuggle the gold. “Some passengers were carrying gold in paste form concealed in their rectums. Some other passengers were also carrying gold in their clothing including socks, trousers, jackets, jeans and even undergarments,” the source further added.

In fact, some passengers were also carrying gold in the support structure of trolley bags. According to Ahmedabad customs, only 6 of the 13 passengers who were booked were arrested, because the gold that they were carrying was valued less than amounts that merited arrest.

Further investigation is in progress in respective cases, confirmed senior officials of Ahmedabad customs.

Prior to these cases reported recently, Ahmedabad customs had registered some 113 cases of gold smuggling between April 1, 2019 and January 31, 2020, and seized 77kg gold worth Rs 27.11 crore from Ahmedabad and Surat airports. Majority of the apprehended passengers arrived from Dubai, Sharjah, Oman, Kuwait and Bangkok, customs officials said.

Sources also said that cases of gold smuggling have gone up with the rise in gold prices and high basic customs duty on gold which stands at 12.5% as on date. Gold price stood at Rs 42,040 per 10 gram in the Ahmedabad market on Monday.

Jaipur: Based on the suggestions received from the steering committee, the Jaipur Development Authority ( JDA ) has initiated work at major nine circle intersections and junctions of the city for swift traffic flow and make them accident-free.

The work of improving design of JDA circle has been started to prevent accidents . An official said, the design of island, median, zebra crossing and pole at the circle intersection will be rectified to prevent accidents.

After a survey, the committee constituted to improve traffic conditions suggested to alter the design of JDA Circle Square, OTS Circle Square, Rambagh Square, Collectorate Circle, Jawahar Circle, Riddhi-Siddhi Junction, Mansarovar Metro Station and B-2 Bypass, New Sanganer Road Junction.

An official said, “An amount of Rs 1.42 crore has been approved. The work will be completed in six months. After the steering committee constituted under the Traffic Control Board submitted suggestions for the prevention of accidents the work was started.”

The official added that to provide clear visibility from Ambedkar Circle and Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) office, the civic body at Rambagh had earlier reduced the size of the railing and chopped the plants and trees. Similar exercise was carried out at JDA Circle. “It was also suggested to reduce the width of the slip lane to 5-7 metre connecting Ambedkar Circle Road and JMC office road,” said a JDA engineer.

The experts of four departments and CEG and L&T firm, after recent accidents, also suggest construction of flyovers at three junctions, including Rambagh, JDA Circle road and OTS Circle. According to the Indian Road Congress (IRC), a flyover should be built if any junction has over 10,000 passenger car units (PCU) crossing it in an hour. The committee had recommended to construct flyovers at these three points. “A proposal to construct a flyover at Rambagh is long pending. However, it was shelved due to lack of funds,” sources said.

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has stayed a preschool from admitting kids for the next academic year, 2020-21, after the housing society, where the school is located, took exception to the “commercial activity”.

The case involves a chain of preschool facilities, Lampros Kids, which has a branch situated at Jivan Prakash Co-operative Housing Society Ltd in Navrangpura area. The residents of the housing society raised objection to the preschool run in the residential area. They approached the board of nominee demanding that the preschool facility should be shut because it is a commercial use of property. They argued that carrying out any commercial activity in the society without permission of the society is against the provisions of cooperative laws.

The board of nominee ordered a status quo, but the residents were not satisfied with the order and approached the high court. A single-judge bench’s direction to the board of nominee to take decision on the dispute within six months also did not pacify them. They filed an appeal before the division bench demanding closure of the school contending that the commercial activity cannot be permitted in residential area.

The bench headed by the Chief Justice ordered the school not to grant new admission to kids for 2020-21 because the school told the court that there would not be any children left in the school on conclusion of the ongoing academic session.

This arrangement is to last till the board of nominee finally decides the dispute whether the school can be run in the society.

There are similar cases of residents of cooperative societies taking exception to use of houses or bungalows by the owners to earn from the rent. They have objected to running of hostels or paying guest facilities in housing societies without permission from a majority of residents.

New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party candidates and their election agents have been tasked to maintain a vigil at the 21 centres at 11 districts across the city where the 92.5 lakh votes polled in the assembly election will be counted on Tuesday. AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal will monitor the results from the party headquarters.

The focus will be on the war room at AAP’s office from where key functionaries will be monitoring the results and remaining in touch with all 70 candidates to get feedback in real-time. Senior AAP functionaries will be present at the headquarters. AAP volunteers, who are hopeful of the party winning the elections , are also expected to gather there.

An average of the exit polls has predicted that the broom (AAP’s symbol) will sweep Delhi on February 11. Some of the exit polls even predicted that AAP will repeat its 2015 landslide victory when it had bagged 67 out of 70 seats.

A huge number of AAP volunteers had come to Delhi from different parts of the country to participate in the poll process. They have planned to return only after the results are announced as they want to join in the celebrations, said party sources.

Meanwhile, on Kejriwal’s instructions, AAP’s volunteers are keeping a strict vigil outside the strongrooms across the city where the EVMs have been stored to ensure there is no “tampering” of the machines. Party functionaries are concerned about the security of EVMs and are not letting their guard down. “We have deployed around 20 volunteers outside each strongroom to keep a vigil round the clock in shifts,” said a senior party functionary.

In many constituencies, the contest is reportedly very close. Impressive voting has taken place in favour of both AAP and BJP and, in some areas, for Congress too.

221,['11/02/2020'],Subsidy on multi agri connections may end,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Patiala: Congress government is now considering a proposal floated by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to cut down power subsidy bill by withdrawing free power to multiple agriculture pumpset (AP) connections held by rich farmers.

The proposal, drafted by the PSPCL, has been sent to the state government. The power corporation has found that there are around 83,000 farmers in the state who are enjoying free power on two or more than two tubewells, taking the total number of such connections to over 1.8 lakh. No final decision has been taken by the state government in the matter. None of the senior officials of the PSPCL were available for comments on the issue.

The report says while a large number of farmers have upto two tubewell connections, there are others who have four and even more than four tubewell connections on which power bill is being paid by the state government. Going by the calculations, if free power is withdrawn and multiple agricultural connections to these farmers, some of whom are big politicians in Punjab, the PSPCL can bring down the subsidy bill of the state government by at least Rs 450 crore.

It will be a fraction of the Rs 9,674.5 crore subsidy bill that the government doles out to various categories of consumers in Punjab with Rs 6,060.27 crore being given to the agriculture sector. However, it can help the PSPCL mop some revenue and lessen its financial burden. The state government is already considering withdrawing power subsidy to rich farmers. The move was prompted by the 30p hike in per-unit cost of power in the state allowed by the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) after the PSPCL moved a petition claiming recovery of Rs 1,490 crore paid to the two case II power plants in the state against coal washing charges.

Sources in the state government said, “As the issue is politically sensitive and can trigger farmers’ backlash, the government is treading cautiously and is exploring all possible ways to cut down the subsidy bill and not annoy a large section of the farming community.

As per a report by Chandigarh-based research institution, the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID), the government can save up to Rs 4,848.216 crore if it withdraws free power to medium and rich farmers, who constitute more than 80% of the total farming community in the state. It has been recommended that free power should only be for small and marginal farmers so as to help them limit the agricultural input costs.

VISAKHAPATNAM: A man accused of producing fake complainants in court and orchestrating a compromise, and his two associates were arrested on Monday.

The city police on Monday said that one Adari Ravi Kumar was under trial in two cases in ADM court (III) in Visakhapatnam city. However, Ravi Kumar conspired to close both cases with the help of two others at the recently concluded Lok Adalat in the city.

The police said Ravi attached the photos of Sanapal Santosh from Hyderabad and Andraju Ravi Kumar, but with the Aadhaar copies of the original complainants on the letter of compromise. The names of the original complainants were Aditya and Siva Teja. Ravi Kumar instead brought in his friends to impersonate as the complainants.

At the Lok Adalat process, some officials noticed the differences in the signatures of the two impersonators with those of the actual complainants on the case files. On questioning, the trio managed to escape. The trio was arrested based on a complaint.

KOLKATA: In what has been described as one of the most talked-about polls of Tollywood ’s West Bengal Motion Picture Artists’ Forum involving 1,896 voters, none of the artistes, who joined Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) or renewed their membership last July, has been elected.

However, none of them used their party colours while contesting the polls. They hope that their vote-share will increase significantly, if they can work for the members of the industry.

Soumitra Chatterjee had been re-elected uncontested for the post of president. Tapas Chakraborty and Soham Bandyopadhyay were elected as treasurer and assistant treasurer respectively. ·Jeet (1485 votes), Paran Bandyopadhyay (1460 votes) and Soham Chakraborty (1223 votes) were elected as vice-presidents. Arindam Ganguly (1539 votes) was re-elected as general secretary while Sankar Chakraborty (692 votes) was elected as the working president. ·Saptarshi Roy (1566 votes) and Santilal Mukherjee (1513 votes) were elected as joint secretaries. Debdut Ghosh (1064 votes) and Rana Mitra (737 votes) became assistant secretaries. ·Kushal Chakraborty (1297 votes), Sonali Chaudhury (918 votes), June Maliah (879 votes), Sagnik (810 votes) and Diganta Bagchi (805 votes) were elected to the five-member executive council.

In July last year, 11 actors from Tollywood had joined the BJP at the party’s Delhi headquarters while two others (Anjana Basu and Kaushik Chakraborty) renewed their membership. Among the new entrants were Kanchana Moitra, Rupanjana Mitra, Parno Mittra, Lama, Biswajit Ganguly, Moumita Gupta, Sourav Chakraborty, Anindya Pulak Banerjee, Debranjan Nag, Rrishii Kaushik and Rupa Bhattcharya . From this list, Sunday’s polls saw the likes of Rupa Bhattacharya, Anjana Basu, Lama, Anindya Banerjee and Kaushik Chakraborty in contention.

However, Monday’s result sheet wasn’t flattering for any of them with Anjana (295 votes), Rupa (459 votes), Lama (505 votes), Anindya (575 votes) and Kaushik (711 votes) not managing to bag any win. Actor-turned-BJP member Kanchana Moitra, who voted for the elections, refuses to see this as a setback. “It is the first time that Lama had contested and he got 505 votes. That is a good number for a first-timer. People voted because Rupa worked to get the dues of television artistes. If they continue with their work, their votes are bound to increase next time,” Moitra said.

According to Kaushik, his intention of contesting the polls was to “depoliticise the forum”. “Though I am a BJP member, I have voted for Soham because he can do better for the industry. I do not want any polarisation inside the forum or a particular lobby to make a clean sweep . Unless we can counter a lobby, we can’t make this forum apolitical,” Kaushik said.

Though Rupa isn’t ready to look at the polls through the political prism, Lama feels his saffron allegiance might have been an important factor. Not unhappy with his performance at the polls, he said, “This forum doesn’t have any political colour and I was not contesting as a party representative. I didn’t campaign and yet people voted for me because I am accessible and they know that I want to work for the industry. After joining politics, I have the colour of the saffron brigade. That too could be a reason for me not having won the elections.”

A Red Corner Notice had been issued against Halari on the request of CBI as he had allegedly bought three scooters and placed them at strategic locations after loading them with explosives. A blast had taken place in one of the three scooters at Zaveri Bazaar.

The blasts in Mumbai on March 12, 1993, led to the death of 257 persons, injured 713 persons and caused destruction of property worth more than Rs 27 crore.

Deputy inspector general of police (DIG) ATS Himanshu Shukla said that Halari was picked up following a tip-off received by Gujarat ATS. “Halari was brought to Ahmedabad on Monday morning. He will soon be handed over to CBI for further investigation’, said Shukla.

DSP ATS, K K Patel, said that after the blasts, Halari had fled to Bareilly in UP from where he escaped overseas to Bangkok. He is reported to have then fled to Nairobi after Tiger Memon arranged a Pakistani passport for him. He has been living in Nairobi, Kenya, under the assumed identity of a Pakistani national, Anwar Muhammad, son of Abdul Majeed with passport No. BMI 799983 since nearly 27 years now. Cops said that Halari set up an export-import business of grains, mainly rice, in the name of Magnum Africa. “This was done at the behest of Memon and is suspected to be a front for smuggling erxplosives and contraband to India,” said a senior police official.

Gujarat ATS officials said they were on the trail of Halari as their information revealed that he was found active in narco-terrorism after his name had cropped up during the interrogation of five Pakistanis caught from the high seas near Gujarat coast involving seizure of 35kg heroin.

The Pakistani boat’s crew, arrested on January 5, had revealed that Halari was in touch with their boss, Haji Hasan of Karachi, to send arms and explosives into Gujarat. He was nabbed after specific input of travel to India in February.

Jaipur: Parents of students studying in the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan's Vidyashram , Jaipur, gathered outside the school premises to protest over the fee hike issue on Monday.

Many parents have refused to pay the hiked fees since October 2019 in protest. Parents accused the school authorities of threatening to debar their wards from sitting in the exam until the fees were paid.

School’s principal Pratima Sharma, however, claimed there was no such protest. “There is no protest in the school and most of the parents have already paid the fees. The matter is sub-judice in Rajasthan High Court and we will take any action only after the decision,” Sharma told TOI.

Dinesh Surana, a parent, said the school increased fee last year although the case was sub-judice in the high court. “They hike fees even after knowing that the matter regarding it is sub-judice. We were demanding a school fees committee in which parents be made members as per the Fees Act 2016. School authorities have not complied with it,” said Dinesh.

Ragiv Aggarwal, another parent, said when parents refused to pay fees the school has threatened to take action against the students. “When the matter is sub-judice school cannot take action against us. They should wait for the judgement and any threatening message will not be acceptable,” said Rajiv.

Amritsar: Sikh girl Jagjit Kaur of Nankana Sahib, Pakistan, will have to stay longer at Dar-ul-Aman, a shelter for women in Lahore, after a local court on Monday fixed February 13 for the verdict in the case.

Her counsel Mohammed Sultan Sheikh told TOI over phone from Lahore on Monday that Jagjit’s brother Manmohan Singh had filed a complaint against her Muslim husband, Mohammad Hasan, for sending objectionable messages to them.

Sheikh said the cyber cell of Nankana Sahib police had registered a case against Hasan and began an investigation. He alleged that Jagjit’s family was adopting delaying tactics, even as the girl had recorded her statement in court that she didn't want to go back to her parents, but wanted to start her married life with Hasan.

On August 28, 2019, Jagjit adopted Islam to become Ayesha Bibi, and the next day she married Hasan according to Islamic rituals. However, her family lodged a complaint with police, claiming that Jagjit was abducted and converted to Islam, and married Hasan against her and their consent.

In a letter to Sonia on Monday, Arora demanded that she should direct Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to fulfil the election promise and scrap agreements. “I wish to draw your attention to an issue of urgent public importance related to future generations of Punjab. AAP has been raising the issue since the formation of the Congress government at all platforms, but to no avail.” added the letter.

“The stand of AAP seems to be validated by a few conscious senior Congress leaders like state president Sunil Jakhar, cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Rajya Sabha MPs Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo, who have been demanding scrapping of the PPAs,” said Arora.

VIJAYAWADA: A group of farmers in the Amaravati capital region moved the Andhra Pradesh high court demanding compensation from Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority ( APCRDA ).

The HC bench headed by Justice Satyanarayana Murthy on Monday heard seven petitions filed by farmers on various issues related to development of the capital region.

One of the petitioners argued that APCRDA had promised to develop returnable plots within three years of the completion of the land pooling process. But it failed to create infrastructure in the layouts and handover the plots to farmers. The petitioner demanded a monthly compensation of Rs 30 per square yard for residential plots and Rs 50 per square yard for commercial plots.

Another petitioner wanted APCRDA to develop the plots as soon as possible.

The HC has sought APCRDA’s response and posted the case to February 24.

Meanwhile, the HC heard petitions challenging the introduction of English medium in government schools.

However, dues under NREGS for road construction projects were cleared recently. Thus, construction work aimed at bringing people in the margins to the mainstream has begun again.

Sources in the engineering wing of the tribal welfare department informed that nearly 1,200 hamlets and around 12,000 households are going to benefit from the connectivity project. Taken up in 2017, around 709 roads are being built stretching across 107km, added the sources.

Speaking to TOI, DK Balaji , project officer of ITDA said, “This connectivity project is important because it will help those living in interior areas and villages connect to other areas. These roads should be pliable for four-wheelers as well as two-wheelers.”

The project officer said that all previous dues for the road convergence projects have been cleared. “Work is being taken up after the project was reviewed by the state government in July, 2019. Projects were reviewed and new proposals made. After which, we have begun work.”

PATIALA: Several farmers in villages of Sanaur area in Patiala district on Monday claimed that their tomato crop had been damaged by the blight disease, triggered by bad weather and fog. However, horticulture department officials claimed that they were unaware of any such reports.

The farmers alleged that the bad weather led to crop damage in Asarpur, Jogipur, Kartarpur, Nurkhedi, Budhanpur Basar and a few other villages. They said horticulture officials should visit them and assess losses. They also demanded compensation from the state government. In Sanaur division, tomato is grown on around 500 acres. Gurvinder Singh, farmer in Asarpur village, around 10km away from Patiala, said, “In our village, the tomato crop has been sown in around 50 of the total 100 acres has been completely damaged. The crop takes four months to be harvested. We had sprayed chemicals on the crop to save it from the diseases, but bad weather ruined everything.”

Neither side made any mention of a widely-anticipated stopover at Agra’s Taj Mahal, an enduring symbol of love and togetherness that has been so appealing to Trump in the past that he named one of properties (Trump Tajmahal in Atlantic City) after it.Both sides also appeared to have abjured a US Presidential address to the Indian Parliament, an item that was part of Democratic Presidential visits (Jimmy Carter 1978, Bill Clinton 2000, and Barack Obama 2010) but which George Bush skipped during his 2006 visit. Dwight Eisenhower was the last Republican President to address the Indian parliament in 1959.It was however confirmed that the President would visit Ahmedabad, where plans are afoot to host a rousing ""Kem Cho, Trump!

The relationship has further evolved under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi and President Trump, with significant progress in all areas including trade, defence, counter-terrorism, energy, coordination on regional and global issues as well as people-to-people ties.

Neither side made any mention of a widely-anticipated stopover at Agra’s Taj Mahal, an enduring symbol of love and togetherness that has been so appealing to Trump in the past that he named one of properties (Trump Tajmahal in Atlantic City) after it.Both sides also appeared to have abjured a US Presidential address to the Indian Parliament, an item that was part of Democratic Presidential visits (Jimmy Carter 1978, Bill Clinton 2000, and Barack Obama 2010) but which George Bush skipped during his 2006 visit. Dwight Eisenhower was the last Republican President to address the Indian parliament in 1959.It was however confirmed that the President would visit Ahmedabad, where plans are afoot to host a rousing ""Kem Cho, Trump! (Howdy Trump) rally to return the gesture of the Trump administration allowing the Howdy Modi fiesta in Houston — the largest rally ever by a foreign leader on US soil.The two leaders are expected to inaugurate the Motera Stadium, one of the world's largest sports arenas with a capacity of 110,000, although local reports suggest it will be a race against time to complete it by February 25.The most likely backdrop for a walkthrough and informal talks will be the Sabarmati waterfront, one of Modi's signature achievements in his home state.Besides the adrenalin of a India-sized rally that is expected to wow Trump, who loves large adoring crowds, the two sides are also expected to ink a trade deal and agreements aimed at boosting Indian purchase of US armaments, including a $2 billion value NASAMS air defense system and $2.6 billion naval helicopter deal.India is also ramping up energy purchase from the US that has gone from zero a decade ago to $6 billion annually, and is expected to touch $10 billion in the next couple of years.“The global strategic partnership between India and the US is based on trust, shared values, mutual respect and understanding, and marked by warmth and friendship between the peoples of the two countries. The relationship has further evolved under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi and President Trump, with significant progress in all areas including trade, defence, counter-terrorism, energy, coordination on regional and global issues as well as people-to-people ties. The visit will provide an opportunity for the two leaders to review progress in bilateral ties and further strengthen our strategic partnership,” a statement from the Indian Prime Minister’s office said.Read this story in Bengali",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74072541,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-74598,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/white-house-announces-trump-visit-to-india-on-february-24-25/articleshow/74072540.cms
240,['11/02/2020'],Crops on 1.49 lakh hectare hit due to locust attacks: Minister,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Jaipur: Crops in over 1.49 lakh hectares have been damaged in various districts because of locust attacks since May and around Rs 90 crore has been provided as subsidy to the affected farmers, agriculture minister Lalchand Kataria told the assembly on Monday.

The minister said locust control programme was carried out in about 5. 29 lakh hectares and due to a joint effort of the state and the Centre, they were able to prevent the spread of pests to other states.

He, however, said no significant damage was caused to kharif crop because of prompt action by the authorities when swarms of locusts entered Jaisalmer on May 21.

“Fresh locust swarms entered the country in December 2019 due to wind intensity and lack of effective control over locusts by Pakistan,” he said amid the BJP criticism that the state did not take timely action to tackle the problem.

He said crops on 1,49,881 hectares — 54,989 hectares in Jaisalmer, 53,682 hectares in Jalore, 33,788 hectares in Barmer, 2,549 hectares in Bikaner, 2,308 hectares in Jodhpur — was damaged.

He said till date the locust control exercise had been taken up on 5,29,602 hectares and pesticides were given to farmers at 100 per cent subsidy.

Kataria said over 33% loss of crops, Rs 13,500 per hectare up to two hectares for irrigated land and Rs 6,800 for non- irrigated areas were given to affected farmers.

Earlier, deputy leader of the opposition, Rajendra Rathore, said the state government could shy away from its responsibility. They demanded waiver of power bills for a year to affected farmers and adequate compensation.

Some members demanded that the state government should carry out a study on the negative impact of the large-scale spraying of insecticides and pesticides.

On this, chief minister Ashok Gehlot intervened and said he was speaking without complete knowledge.

Gehlot said, “Your Union minister in the Rajya Sabha has said the Rajasthan government did the best job in locust control. Even if you don't believe us, trust the Union minister of your government.”

241,['11/02/2020'],Applicants suffer due to shortage of cards at RTO,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Indore: It’s something or the other. After shortage of smart cards halting work of Indore RTO around a month ago, it’s now shortage of cards that has now apparently affected vehicle registration work for past 20 days or more.

Over 5000 registration certificate (RC) applications are pending due to unavailability of cards, claimed sources. Officials engaged in work complained that delay in clearing pending applications is putting them under pressure even as they struggle with shortage of cards.

The applicants can be seen running pillar to post on any given day at RTO to obtain RCs of their newly purchased vehicles.

Rakesh Kumar of Vijay Nagar said that he had bought a two-wheeler in second week of January. “The dealer had applied for my vehicle’s registration, but I haven’t received it yet. Even officials at RTO are not ready to explain about the reason behind the delay,” he said.

Sources claimed that even applications that have already been processed and cards have been generated, officials are not ready to issue it. “They are not able to take record of applications owing to increase in pendency, and this is leading to delay in issuance of cards,” they said. RTO officials refuted the allegations and said that there is no major delay. “RCs are delivered within 30 days and applicants who have not received their RCs can approach senior officials,” said Archana Mishra, an assistant regional transport officer with Indore RTO.

She however admitted slight delay in printing of cards due to limited supply and said that issue would be addressed soon. “The staff engaged in processing applications has also been instructed to speed up work to clear pendency,” she added.

On an average, Indore RTO receives around 500-700 applications of fresh and transfer of RCs. These cards are sent to applicants through speed post.

Indore: To meet the annual revenue target of Rs 1161cr set by state government, Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) is now targeting at least Rs 100cr from owners of diverted lands of 29 villages that were included within municipal limits of Indore.

Exploring avenues to achieve the numbers, the corporation has issued a public notice instructing diverted land owners to get their property registered with IMC and pay due property tax.

Officials said that there are around 1000 such diverted lands of which accounts have yet not been opened.

“We conducted a survey of 29 villages and found that each of these villages have at least 30-40 diverted lands of which information is not available in IMC’s record,” IMC’s additional commissioner SK Chaitanya told TOI.

He said that apart from public notice, individual notices have also been sent to each of the identified plot owners instructing them to pay property tax of their respective land from 2014-15 – the year, when their property was included within municipal limits of Indore.

“All of them have been instructed to clear dues of their respective diverted land within the next 15 days. If they fail to do it, then IMC would start sealing their property,” he added.

Most of these properties fall under southern zones of city.

Corporation officials expect a recovery of at least Rs100 crore from these property. The corporation has so far collected around Rs280 crore as property tax and this action is seen as part of an ongoing recovery drive of corporation to achieve a target of Rs1161 crore set by state government.

The civic body has also launched a drive to identify power grids set up by Madhya Pradesh Vidyut Vitaran Company Ltd (MPPKVVCL) in 29 villages. Officials found that there are no records of some of grids set up on public space and discom was not paying tax against land on which grids have been installed.

Chandigarh: Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar on Monday said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) could get a ‘second chance’ in Punjab if it won the Delhi assembly elections, but it would not be able to capitalise on it as its house was not in order in the state.

Talking to media on the sidelines of a press conference, Jakhar said in reply to a question on AAP: “Punjab was the only state where people gave AAP a chance, but they proved themselves to be a massive failure. In the last three years, they have nothing to redeem themselves. If one goes by the exit polls for Delhi elections, they may get another opportunity to prove themselves again, which I feel they won’t.” “They may get a second life. Otherwise they have been written off. I don’t think AAP will be able to use it (a win in Delhi) to its benefit,” he said.

Jakhar said a decision on rebel AAP leaders should have ideally been taken by now, but it was the prerogative of the assembly speaker. “Otherwise, I think people elected them and the way they (MLAs) have failed to performed in the three years, they are only exposing themselves,” he said.

244,['11/02/2020'],"No private land will be acquired, assure minister","This story is from February 11, 2020

VISAKHAPATNAM: State tourism minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao and minister for municipal administration Botcha Satyanarayana lashed out at the opposition on Monday and said that instead of backing corrupt officials, the opposition should support the government when it is taking action against such officials.

In two separate meetings in the city on Monday, the ministers alleged that former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu was supporting corrupt officials and was blaming the government for taking action against them.

Saying that rumours are being spread about land pooling, the tourism minister said, “No private patta lands are being acquired. Only government and assigned land is. Moreover, in case of government land, encroachers are being provided 400 square yards, while in case of government land, assignees are being provided pattas for 900 sq yards.

M Srinivasa Rao further said that 25 lakh houses are being planned for the poor, of which 2.47 lakh will be in Visakhapatnam district and of that, 1.47 lakh will be within GVMC limits. Each beneficiary in the city will be provided 70 sq yard plots, he added.

Minister for municipal administration, Botcha Satyanarayana said 6,116 acres of government land has been identified within GVMC limits and clarified only those squatters who have occupied the land for at least 10 years will benefit.

245,['11/02/2020'],My stormy old friend Giriraj is no more,"This story is from February 11, 2020

The death of a friend is like the loss of a limb’ goes a saying in the German. Today, as I hear about the passing away of Giriraj Kishore , I experienced the same feeling. When I first met the Hindi writer in Delhi, I was overwhelmed by his simplicity and commitment.

A Padma Shri awardee, the unadorned and unfussy writer was easy to befriend. Over the years, I lost touch with many of my friends, but Giriraj continued to remain close to me, perhaps because we shared ideological perspectives. A man of conviction and commitment, he was firm in his faith in the values he cherished. With no pretentions and no inhibitions, he always remained unassuming and undemanding.

When you go through his works Pahala Girmitiya and his latest novel, Baa, you realize how much he is immersed in the life and ideology of Mahatma Gandhi. As the author of the book, he maintained textbook objectivity, making the novel an authentic account of the years in the life of the Mahatma. Writing Baa must have been a difficult exercise for him, as he wrote about the bittersweet relationship the couple shared. A reading of Baa evokes sympathy for Kasturba to an extent the reader feels sorry for her and angry with Gandhi. When you are weighed down by the greatness of the Father of the Nation, it is indeed difficult to write about the shortcomings of the great man. But the author would have failed to uphold the truth as was perceived by Gandhi if he was to push the hardships faced by Kasturba under the carpet. I feel sorry that Giriraj did not live to see his novel Baa translated into Konkani.

As a valued colleague at the Sahitya Akademi and a close personal friend, I have been privy to his positive contribution to this premier institution of literature. He was invariably on his toes to praise good work and was critical of things that were not in the interest of literature. Edmund Burke once said, “For evil to flourish, all that is needed is for good people to do nothing”. Giriraj, my fellow writer, was not among the indifferent. When the situation demanded, he stood up unhesitatingly. This is yet another quality he had absorbed from his in-depth study of Gandhi.

In 2012, Giriraj returned the Padma Shri bestowed upon him by the government of India when Gandhi memorabilia was auctioned despite his protests. When Amitabh Bachchan was invited to a literary conference of the Vishwa Hindi Meet sidelining many Hindi writers, it was Giriraj who condemned the move. In 2015, after the death of M M Kalburgi, there was a spate of ‘award wapsis’. Here, too, Giriraj was at the forefront.

He would not tolerate any attack on freedom of expression, and neither would he accept ill-treatment to fellow writers who spoke for free speech. When I was in Delhi to participate in a panel discussion on ‘Sarkar v/s sahityakar’, organized live on a reputed TV channel, I was happy to find Giriraj on my team. He did not spare a single opportunity to air his views, whether or not they clashed with the establishment. In today’s India, when the very idea of free India is threatened, we breathe easy only because we have people who are on their toes to voice their concern for a united and secular India. With Giriraj Kishore gone, we will miss a stalwart to fight alongside.

Giriraj visited Goa several times at my invitation — on a couple of occasions with his better half, Meera. When the father figure of Goan writers, Ravindra Kelekar, was bestowed with the Sahitya Akademi’s fellowship, Giriraj was all praise for the candid and forthright speech by the Gandhian Kelekar. In April 2011, Giriraj inaugurated the All-India Konkani Sahitya Sammelan.

To date, writers in Goa continue to remember his words of wisdom. He attended the seventh edition of the Goa Art & Literature Festival. And two years ago, he visited Goa yet again to attend the Sangman conference. The stalwart will be remembered for both his literary contribution, as well as his fearlessness.

The writer is a Sahitya Akademi award-winning author

246,['11/02/2020'],Citrus cultivation can up farm income: Experts,"This story is from February 11, 2020

VISAKAPATNAM: Horticulture experts in Visakhapatnam district are of the opinion that cultivation of citrus fruits can augment farm income and improve soil conservation practices in orchards in north Andhra Pradesh.

Citrus trees were traditionally grown in coconut plantations along the coastal belt of Visakhapatnam district but disappeared after the plantations were taken over for industry. The trees, which require shade, were easier to grow on coconut plantations where the canopy cover was greater than in traditional mango orchards. Experts said that at present, citrus trees can be grown on mango orchards as hybrid strains of the fruit are closely planted and provide a dense canopy, but added that ample water is also required.

“The problem with most mango orchards is that the owners do not utilise groundwater resources. We frequently request them to dig borewells, replenishment holes and also provide a 70 per cent subsidy to farmers for drip irrigation, but these are not done,” said K Sailaja , assistant director of the department of horticulture, Visakhapatnam.

Sources in the department said mixed cropping would provide farmers with a buffer income and also enrich the soil as leaves of citrus trees are rich in nutrients.

Farmer and soil conservationist D Srinivas from Jagammpeta in East Godavari district said, “Citrus leaves are soil enrichers and the compost helps the soil regain strength. It is also an excellent soil binder and requires little water. Citrus trees thrive in any orchard provided there is canopy cover and the soils are loamy and well-drained.”

K Sailaja added, “If farmers become aware of the advantages of planting citrus trees on their orchards and provide enough water, the north-coastal stretch could have mixed plantations that yield citrus fruit as well.”

Jaipur: Recent cases of minor girls’ being raped in Jaipur, Churu and Sikar, have kept city police on toes.

On a missing report of an 11-year-old girl in Muhana police station limits, city police deployed a fleet of 200 policemen to search for the girl which ended around 7am on Monday when the girl was found sleeping at the doorsteps of a temple in Muhana area.

The girl left the house around 9pm. When her relatives filed the complaint, police launched a massive search to ward off any crime against the minor girl. Recently, a case of minor girl being raped in Murlipura gave sleepless night, but police managed to arrest the accused within 24 hours of the incident.

“The girl left the house by herself. She is mentally unstable. No crime has happened against her,” said Yogesh Dadhich, DCP, South Jaipur.

Police said the parents of the girl died recently and she is staying with her younger brother at her uncle’s house. “Since she was minor, we took it seriously and the higher officials deployed teams of 200 policemen in the area to search the girl. We searched her at railway tracks, temples, houses in the neighbourhood, streets and roads and around 7am, we found her sleeping outside a temple. She is safe,” said Heeralal Saini, station house officer, Muhana.

Police said it is not the first time that the girl went missing. But, this time around, she went far and since she did not come back and the family did not find her in nearby areas, they filed a missing report.

Indore: Indore Municipal Corporation’s luxurious guest house at Vanchu Point will soon become a prefect weekend getaway for Indoreans.

The civic body is going to lease out the facility to a private agency, which operate and maintain the facility as a hotel — a perfect place for picnickers planning short travel around the city.

A decision in this regard has been taken by corporation authorities to ensure proper maintenance of the rest house and also generate revenue.

IMC commissioner Asheesh Singh said that they are considering the option to hire a private agency to run the Vanchu Point guest house as a hotel.

“We are going to hand over this property on a 30-year lease to private party to run and maintain it. A fix annual premium would be collected from the agency with around 5 per cent increase per year,” Singh said.

“Tenders have already been invited and if all goes as per plan, the facility will be made open for public in April this year,” he added.

Officials said that it’s a seven-room rest house, which was developed in 1978 by public health engineering (PHE) department and the facility is now managed and run by IMC.

The agency will be allowed to renovate and operate the guest house as a hotel for tourists to stay.

For people of Indore and adjoining areas, Vanchu Point located atop hills on Narmada water supply route between Jalood and Indore and known for having a perfect sun set view, has always been a favourite destination for picnickers.

Madhya Pradesh State Tourism Development Corporation (MPSTDC) had earlier announced to develop this spot at a tourist destination. However the plan could never materialize.

Sources in MPSTDC said that the area sees tourists’ footfall only during monsoon and generating revenue from there by promoting it as a tourist spot for round the year was not found feasible.

VISAKHAPATNAM: The city’s cybercrime police, on Monday, arrested 32-year-old S Abdul Mufeez for duping people to the tune of Rs 11.5 lakh in the guise of selling them herbal products.

V Gopinath , an inspector at the city’s cybercrime police station, said Abdul Mufeez—a native of Kurnool—posted an advertisement in a newspaper for the recruitment of a distributor for herbal and ayurvedic products.

Representative image

JAIPUR: After rumours of liquor ban in Rajasthan abounded following the visit of a team of officials to Bihar, chief minister Ashok Gehlot clarified that the government was not planning any such move.

But the liquor policy announced on Saturday may turn out to be prohibitory for the state’s thriving tourism industry and its numerous segments like weddings, conference business and hotel industry.

Come April , when the new policy kicks in, you may have to shell out nearly 50% the price you are paying now in hotel bars, if they pass on the full increase in licence fees. There is not much relief even if you visit resto bars, as annual charges for them have also gone up from Rs 9 lakh to Rs 12 lakh.

Even the aam aadmi has not been spared either. After undertaking two increases last year, the excise department has raised the additional duty by another 5% to 25% (for liquor costing Rs 950 distillery price). Additionally, the licence fees for government shops have shot up from Rs 22 lakh to Rs 26 lakh.

Nilesh Mewara, president of Rajasthan Liquor Welfare Society, said, “With such hefty increases in licence fees, hike in additional duty and application fees, the prices are expected to go up significantly for customers who also buy from government licenced liquor shops. The price list for 2020-21 has not been declared, but we expect an overall increase of 15-20% for common people.”

Last year, five-star hotels paid Rs 17 lakh as licence fee and 10% more for every extra counter. As per the new policy, while the basic fee remains at Rs 15 lakh, it is now mandatory for them to get three additional counters with each costing Rs 5 lakh.

The new fee structure is similar for all star-categories hotels. Four-star hotels will now have to cough up Rs 22 lakh against Rs 12 lakh earlier, while for three-star properties the fee will rise to Rs 15 lakh against Rs 8.5 lakh last year. Rates for all other hotels without any star category have also been doubled.

Many in the hospitality and tourism industry expressed disappointment that the exorbitant rise in liquor prices would cripple the tourism industry, wedding and meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) business for which Rajasthan was emerging as a new hub in the country.

“You cannot kill a goose that gives golden eggs. We will lose a significant part of our MICE business to our rival cities. The fate of many sub-segment industry is tied to tourism and hospitality. Such a steep hike in liquor prices will make Jaipur or any other city of Rajasthan economically uncompetitive,” said a hotelier preferring anonymity.

While the new policy talks about some innovative features like licenced shops offering bills, and bottles having chips that will provide information about where it’s made and to be sold, the industry feels the policy will be potentially detrimental to the growth of tourism industry.

Hotel Licence Fees

2020-21 2019-20

5-star hotels Rs 30 lakh Rs 21.8 lakh

4-star hotels Rs 22 lakh Rs 14.20 lakh

3-start hotels Rs 15 lakh Rs 9.35 lakh

In 2019-20 policy, all non-star hotels within urban limits were charged licence fees according to number of rooms: 1-50 room hotel – Rs 9 lakh, 51-100 room hotel – Rs 11 lakh, 101-room and above – Rs 16 lakh. But now they will have single fees at Rs 20 lakh.

After some time, they set up an e-mail account similar to that one of the businessman’s supplier and sent him an e-mail stating he had to deposit money in a new bank account for an upcoming business transaction. Since the fraudster’s e-mail was similar to the supplier’s, the businessman deposited the amount believing it is the same supplier.“In some cases, some businessmen have deposited money foreign bank accounts too,” Ravi Kumar added.“We have been appealing to people to set a strong password and change it frequently so that their accounts are less susceptible to hacking. Fraudsters are also creating fake websites with advertisements for girls for friendships and fun and friendship clubs, to name a few,” the SI added.City police chief RK Meena said that, in the past three years, the city saw over 1,100 cybercrimes, the majority of which were related to e-commerce sites, job frauds, e-mail hacking, and few others.Revealing that not more than 30% of these cases were detected, RK Meena said that the police are chalking out plans to seek the support of a few cyber experts to solve the cases.Another senior police officer said that while the police had nabbed the fraudsters, they were struggling to recover the money.",visakhapatnam,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74075861,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-81599,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/hackers-target-city-bizmens-e-mails-lakhs-siphoned-off/articleshow/74070699.cms
252,['11/02/2020'],Speaker accused of shifting med college,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Jaipur: Rajsamand BJP MLA Kiran Maheshwari has accused assembly speaker CP Joshi of taking a proposed medical college from her constituency to close to his own constituency Nathdwara by flouting norms to gain political mileage.

Maheshwari accused Rajsamand DM Arvind Kumar Poswal of working for Joshi while manipulating rules and regulations.

Maheshwari told TOI that the central government had allotted the medical college in Rajsamand under Centrally Sponsored Scheme(CSS) for better medical facilities to citizens of the district. “Our proposal was to establish the medical college in the civil hospital of Rajsamand which is spread over 17.5 acres and to meet the remaining 2.5 acres by acquiring it from the allotted land for a girls college nearby,” said Maheswari.

She accused Joshi of influencing the administration for taking the location in Devpuria village almost in his constituency. She produced documents pointing that Rajasthan State Road Development and Construction Corporation in its inspection report on the land noted that it would double up the cost of the hospital.

“Along with the cost, the land is amid the marble slurry which will further put the lives of patients and staff in danger,” said Maheshwari.

Joshi while refuting the allegations said, “Rather than appreciating the efforts of the state government which is making efforts to start the medical college, the accusations are laughable,” said Joshi.

The rule says a college should be in districts which doesn’t have any medical institute. However, the district has one private medical college. The state has moved a file seeking an exception to the rule.

Poswal told TOI that as per directions from the state, the land has been identified at Devpuria Village. “The medical college is allotted to Rajsamand district which means it can come up at any suitable place. Our civil hospital in Nathdwara has 200 beds while in Rajsamand it has 150 beds, which makes the former the ideal choice for the college. Even the distance of the identified place is just 7km from Nathdwara and 8km from Rajsamand district,” said Poswal.

Tehsildar of Rajsamand Dhyan Chand told TOI that Devpuria village is in Rajsamand. “The village is some 8 km from Rajsamand and 7 km from Nathdwara,” said Chand.

253,['11/02/2020'],Farmers seek to extend water release from PAP,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Coimbatore: Nearly 50 farmers from in and around Vettaikaranpudur who receive water from the Parambikulam Aliyar Project (PAP) to irrigate their farmlands on Monday petitioned district collector K Rajamani to release water daily from Aliyar Dam till March 18.

Alleging that they have received only half the water that’s usually released from the dam, farmers said as a result their cultivation has been affected. They blamed it on the poor condition of Vettaikaranpudur canal, which they said was having seepage issue, and requested water to be released from Aliyar Dam daily from today (Monday) till March 18 or beyond that, if required.

The farmers said according to the government order, the Public Works Department (PWD) was ordered to release water from Aliyar Dam for irrigation from November 4 to March 18, for around 135 days.

“Usually, out of the 135 days, they will release water for 70 days,” said Vikram Muthurathinasabari, young farmer from the Parambikulam Aliyar Pasanthottai Neerani Payanpaduthuvor Sangam (PAP irrigated water users association). “By that calculation, we should have received water for around 25 days so far. However, we have received water only for 14 days.

The farmers said while the Vettaikaran canal serves around 11,181 acres of farmland, only around 5,558 acres were under cultivation now. “They released water from two different directions. So on any given day, only half the 5,558 acres received water. Which means we got water only for 14 days,” says Vikram.

Farmers fear that the PWD will follow the government order and stop releasing water on March 18. It means water will be released for only 24 of the remaining 48 days, while farmlands will get water only for 12 more days. “This is not enough to moisture or water for our lands, where we cultivate coconut, maize, groundnut and banana, all of which are perennial crops,” said another farmer.

Farmers demanded that PWD should release water every day from the Aliyar Dam for the remaining 48 days, to make up for the deficit or continue releasing water after March 18 also, if required.

Farmers said the bad shape of the Vettaikaran canal is the reason that the entire area does not receive water every day that it is released. “The water seepage from the canal is so severe, that 50% of the water is lost on the way before it reaches our lands,” says Vikram. “PWD should repair the canal to ensure that every litre of water they release actually reaches our lands,” he adds.

254,['11/02/2020'],Recent train robberies raise concerns over lack of security,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Kannur: The recent cases of two train robberies , reported on the same day in two trains , Chennai-Mangaluru Superfast Express and Thiruvananthapuram-Mangaluru Malabar Express, has once again brought to the fore the question as to how safe our trains are, especially for night travel.

Though the railways is said to be making all efforts to ensure the safety and security of the passengers, most stations do not have surveillance cameras and there is dearth of security personnel.

Though railway has integrated security system (ISS), as part of which surveillance cameras have been installed at major stations, it is yet to cover many stations. In Palakkad division, only Kozhikode and Mangaluru have cameras, many of which are not functioning.

“When the authorities buy surveillance and security systems, they should also ensure that there is manpower to manage it, but in many places, it is lacking,” said an official associated with the railway protection force (RPF).

In Kannur, there are no cameras under the surveillance system and manpower is insufficient. Out of the total strength of 25 including the inspector, only 21 staffers are present and three of them must be deployed at Mahe. The post of the inspector has been lying vacant for nearly a year. Sometimes the RPF personnel have to work round-the-clock, without taking an off, to handle surveillance.

This is not unique to Kannur alone. Most railways stations in India face the same problem and this has started affecting the safety of passengers too. As per the deployment in 1980, the calculation was that there would be six personnel per train. Now the number of trains have increased but the manpower remains the same. “The higher officials have said that increasing manpower is out of the question but if that is the condition, how can security be enhanced, as the number of trains and passengers have increased manifold,” asked an official who did not want to be identified. Moreover, there is no proper system in place to repair and maintain the security systems. However, surveillance cameras are there in some stations, which are not disclosed to others, and the footages from these are expected to shed some light on the thefts, said some official sources in the railway.

Unlike the past, the profile of the thieves has changed and they are often well dressed, not to create any suspicion among the passengers, and even reserve tickets, said the officials. “In the two recent cases, the investigators suspect a gang attack, and the police team is investigating if they had information that the victims were carrying valuable items, and if the listed criminals are involved,” said a railways spokesperson.

255,['11/02/2020'],Ministers have no collective responsibility: Dy Oppn leader,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Jaipur: Deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore on Monday cited several instances of rift between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot.

While speaking on the governor’s address in the assembly, Rathore said Pilot, while achieving the milestone of completing uninterrupted six years in the post of Congress state chief on January 20, claimed that the party was in power due to the long struggle against the policies of the BJP government by his party workers under his leadership. In the same breath, Rathore said Gehlot had on January 10 claimed that he had become the chief minister on popular demand. “Whom should we believe,” he questioned.

While drawing the attention of Article 162 of the Constitution, Rathore alleged that the cabinet had no collective responsibility.

He said Rajasthan was in the limelight in November- December after 112 children died at J K Lon Hospital in Kota. When the news reached the Congress high command, a team under deputy chief minister visited the hospital and said “the government is in power for over a year and we cannot pass the buck. Responsibility had to be fixed.”

The opposition leaders also visited the hospital and found that its condition was pathetic. Medical and health minister visited the hospital and accused the PWD handled by deputy chief minister of dereliction of duty.

He said the dual power centre was visible everywhere under this government. “Whether it is the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) election or the hybrid election to local bodies, the cabinet was a divided house. The deputy chief minister was found missing from posters and hoardings of the first anniversary celebration of the state government. Pilot while inaugurating the students’ union at Rajasthan University on January 17 accused the government of arrogance on returning to power. Now the central leadership had formed a coordination committee.

256,['11/02/2020'],Narol fire: Investigation transferred to SC/ST Cell,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Ahmedabad: After the horrific blaze at Nandan Denim Ltd on Narol-Pirana Road killed seven persons, investigation of the case, filed under IPC Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed), has been transferred to the SC/ST Cell of the city police.

The fire that started on Saturday evening spread quickly in the production unit and claimed seven lives — primarily from the shirting and designing sections. The bodies were found from the first floor of the unit where they were completely charred. Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) carried out the operation for nearly nine hours. Four bodies were found on Saturday and three more on Sunday.

Senior city police officials said that the decision was taken after one of the deceased was found to be belonging to scheduled caste (SC). Critics however saw the move as ineffective to provide justice to the families of the deceased. They claimed that with the sections applied, a local police station would have been better equipped for such a case.

On Monday, a team consisting of police and forensic science laboratory (FSL) officers visited the unit. “Primary reason was to inspect the spots that could not be accessed due to debris on Sunday. The team spent close to three hours and collected samples including charred cloth, parts of machinery tools and remains of the metal to get an idea of the possible temperature, cause of fire and direction of its spread,” said an official associated with the process.

Meanwhile, relatives of the deceased could not get the bodies due to forensic procedure. “We have been told that the DNA extraction and matching is pending and it might take a day or two. We want the responsible to be brought to book,” said Vinod Bhanderi, the relative of a deceased. “We have started rites for the deceased though.”

Only 584 have fire NOC

In Ahmedabad, which has at least five major industrial clusters in and around the city, only 584 units have no-objection certificate (NOC) issued by the Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES), said sources. Nandan Denim did not have the certificate, they added. In a letter written on Monday, M F Dastoor, chief fire officer of AFES and also director of state fire services, has asked the government to give more powers to the AFES and fire service to act. Thirteen out of 27 fatal fire accidents in Ahmedabad had taken place in industrial units. In the first 40 days of this year, 14 including the 7 in Narol incident have lost lives in fire accidents.

AMC suspends operations at Nandan Denim

Ahmedabad: A day after a massive fire killed seven people at Nandan Denim factory in Narol area, the civic body directed the company to stall processing activity till further notice. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s South Zone office has suspended all licences (non-edible) issued to the company for operating the processing plant. It has also accused the company of violating all fire safety norms and has directed it to reapply for a fresh set of licences. The notice mentions that the licences have been suspended ‘till further notice’ and until ‘proper inspection is conducted at the premises.’

Visakhapatnam: With the Union ministry recently allocating funds for East Coast Railway’s (ECoR) Umbrella Works—a special category for the creation of new coaching terminals—the decks seem to have been cleared for setting up a new coaching terminal or railway station complex at Marripalem .At present, the city has only one major station. Now that Visakhapatnam is the headquarters of South Coast Railway (SCoR), it will need more stations to de-congest traffic .To develop another major railway station, ECoR sent a proposal to renovate the Marripalem railway station, which included a detail project report with an estimated cost of Rs 76 crore—to the Railway board few months ago. Responding to the report, the Centre allocated Rs 5 crores for the ECoR’s Umbrella works in the budget, railway sources said.They added that the works would hopefully begin in the next financial year and all project details would be displayed in the Railways’ annual ‘law book’, which is likely to be released in next two months.“The renovation of Marripalem station is a part of developing the headquarters of South Coast Railway (SCoR). Nearly 37 trains originating in Vizag will be shifted from the existing station to Marripalem once the project is operational,” a senior railway official told TOI.Four new railway lines, with two main lines, will be laid and all the lines will be integrated into a terminal connected to the existing Visakhapatnam railway station. Currently, 118 trains pass through the existing main station daily. The average footfall is around 50,000 per day and during peak season, it goes up to around 1 lakh. Once the renovated Marripalem station is ready, the existing footfall of 1,000 is likely to be increased to 10,000, sources said.“At present, 37 trains pass through Marripalem from the city railway station. In future, all 37 trains will be originating at Marripalem. It is like Bangalore-Yeswanthapur, Hyderabad-Kachiguda, and Chennai-Egmore,” the railway officer said.Even the length of the platform will be changed. “The present length is 420 meters. This will be doubled,” officials said. Similarly, the seating capacity of a platform—which is 120 passengers—will also be increased to 250 to 300 seats, at Marripalem.",visakhapatnam,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74075664,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-243048,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/renovated-marripalem-stn-to-be-operational-by-2022/articleshow/74070745.cms

262,['11/02/2020'],Residents oppose panchayat’s bid to use park site to build hall,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Coimbatore: Residents of KG Nagar in Kazhangal town panchayat on Monday petitioned district collector K Rajamani against the local body’s move to take over the open space that was earmarked for park in the area to construct a community hall. They said the residents’ welfare association had been working to convert the open space into a park and playground since October last year and appealed the collector to protect the reserved site.

Kazhangal panchayat president Ranganathan, however, said only less than a sixth of the land was required to construct the hall and that the residents were opposing the move as they didn’t want the poor and lower caste people to conduct functions in their neighbourhood. He also said the protest was backed by DMK members in the area.

Pointing out that the property developer had handed over 56 cents land as reserved site to the panchayat more than 16 years back, S Sivakumar, secretary, KG Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association, said, “But the panchayat hasn’t taken any step to develop the space into park so far.”

Vellai Pandian, association president, said the residents had unanimously decided to turn the open space into a park and playground for children and elderly people in October last year. “We then planted almost 250 tree saplings and also set up a volleyball court and two badminton courts.”

Meanwhile, Kazhangal village panchayat board approached the residents recently, stating they had decided to use the land to build a community hall. “How can they use the land to build a community hall, while it has been earmarked as open space reserve land? It is against the rules,” Sivakumar said.

The panchayat president admitted that he had begun work on the community hall in the area. “But I am taking only 8.5 cents land out of the 56 cents. They can create a park in the remaining area. I chose this space for the 3,500sqft hall to be set up at a cost of Rs 74 lakh, as it is closer to the bus stand than the earlier chosen space. Also, roads are 45ft wide and vehicles could be park on roadsides. It is also a clean area.”

Ranganathan said the residents were opposed to the project as they were afraid that scheduled caste people would hold functions in the community hall, which is less expensive. “Also, this protest is politically motivated by the previous panchayat president, who lost the elections, and the DMK,” he said.

A condolence meet was held at IIT-K to pay tributes to Giriraj Kishore

Kanpur: IIT-Kanpur, on Monday, held a condolence meet to pay tributes to Padma Shri Giriraj Kishore who passed away at his residence in Sooterganj on Sunday.

Giriraj Kishore had served as registrar of the institute from December 1975 to November 1983. He also served as assistant registrar and deputy registrar of CSJM (Kanpur) University between 1966 and 1975.

Remembering the author, IIT-Kanpur’s media cell stated that it was due to efforts of Giriraj Kishore that a separate department, Centre For Creative Writing and Publication, was set up in the institute. Kishore remained the head of this department till 1997.

A technical institute like IIT, where English was the only language for academic and research purpose, the use of Hindi was propogated by Giriraj Kishore and he immensely contributed to its cause. Several literary fest at national level were also organised in the institute due to his efforts, said the IIT-K authorities.

Giriraj Kishore wrote several novels, story collections, drama, articles and essays promoting Hindi and received various awards for his literary work including Padma Shi given by the then Central government in 2007.

The IIT-K authorities said that demise of Giriraj Kishore is a huge loss not only to the literary world but also for the institute.

Among those who were present at the meet were IIT-K director Prof Abhay Karandikar, deputy director Prof Manindra Agarwal and others. A two minute silence was observed for the departed soul.

Meanwhile, mortal remains of Giriraj Kishore were, on Monday, handed over to GSVM medical College by his family, as per his last wish.

Armed with “additional facts” to strengthen his case against oil and gas exploration in the delta region, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Monday sought the Centre ’s support to declare the belt an “ecologically sensitive agricultural zone”. On Sunday, the CM sprung a surprise by announcing in Salem that the Cauvery delta would be declared a protected agriculture zone .A delegation of AIADMK MPs and senior officers, led by senior minister D Jayakumar, presented a letter from the chief minister to Union minister for environment, forests and climate change Prakash Javadekar in New Delhi. Ministers Dharmendra Pradhan (petroleum and natural gas) and Pralhad Joshi (parliamentary affairs) were also present.In the letter, a copy of which is available with TOI, EPS requested the Centre to stop future plans for exploration and mining of hydrocarbons in the delta. “It is our strong view that the ecologically sensitive Cauvery delta region should be excluded from any exploration, development and production of hydrocarbons in future,” the CM said. The Centre is requested to add a provison excluding the region from the purview of the January 16 amendment notification, he said.“The negative aspect of hydrocarbon projects outweigh advantages claimed by the proponents. Pipeline failures, accidents, spills and explosions can lead to property and ecological damage, loss of life and adversely impact health and habitat in a densely populated agrarian belt,”The delta region is known for its rich archaeological and cultural heritage, with famous monuments like Brihadeshwarar temple of Thanjavur, the Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple, the Navagraha temples, the Velankanni church and the Nagore Dargah dotting the region. EPS said it was apprehended that hydrocarbon exploration will destroy the cultural heritage of the country.“There will be a good response from the Centre in four days,” Jayakumar told reporters later. Agriculture department sources said discussions on legal aspects were on.In the letter, the CM pointed to additional facts (based on empirical reports) and said it would “clearly reinforce the need to preserve the ecologically sensitive agricultural zone of delta region”, which contributed more than 32% of state’s food production. Based on an expert committee report, the state had observed in 2015 that exploration of coal bed methane (CBM) would cause the risk of sea-water intrusion in the delta. “The exploration of hydrocarbons would detrimentally affect the livelihood and food security of the state… It is apprehended that the exploration of hydrocarbons will adversely affect sub-surface water, including causing possible damage to borewell shafts. Further, criss-crossing of gas and waste water pipelines will detrimentally affect the natural surface and sub-surface features now existing in the delta,” the CM said.",madurai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74080696,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-788488,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/eps-writes-to-centre-seeks-support-for-protecting-cauvery-zone/articleshow/74080733.cms

Chandigarh: Haryana health and medical education minister Anil Vij on Monday said a medical college each will be opened in Yamunanagar, Kaithal and Sirsa districts at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore. With this, he said, the number of medical colleges opened during the tenure of BJP government in Haryana would go up to 13.

Vij said the construction of colleges would begin soon. He said the central and state governments had already given approval to this and more than Rs 325 crore would be spent on each of these medical colleges.

The state government, he said, had been making efforts to activate the working of these medical colleges by 2023. He said these colleges would be constructed on 20 acres each and with the arrangement of around 200 beds. He said this step will help the state produce more doctors and improve medical care.

The minister said government medical colleges, which had been approved by the BJP government during its last tenure, were already underway. These colleges include Government Medical College and Hospital, Koriyawas, Mahendragarh; Government Medical Colleges and Hospital in Jind; Government Medical College and Hospital in Gurgaon; and Government Medical College in Bhiwani.

Besides, his government had already started six other medical colleges over the last five years, Vij said.

Kannur: Alleging that the government has not kept its promises and the authorities are ignoring and side-lining them, the endosulfan victims in Kasaragod have announced yet another round of agitation, and they are planning an indefinite sit-in at Kasaragod collectorate from March 25.

There were many promises that CM Pinarayi Vijayan had made during a discussion with them last year, but till date many of the promises have not been kept and this has forced them to launch this agitation, said Muneesa Ambalathara, who is an endosulfan victim and the president of the Endosulfan Peeditha Janakeeya Munnani, which fights for the cause of the affected people.

“We are not getting pension regularly and when we raise our voice, some dues are cleared but it accumulates again,” she said.

When they raise their issues, the government says everything is handled by the district collector, but when the collector is of the stand that endosulfan is not the culprit for their tragedy, how they could expect justice, she asked.“The collector claims that endosulfan has no such problems, but till date they have not removed the barrels of the killer pesticide kept in the warehouse of the Plantation Corporation, and the claim is that it needs over Rs 40 lakh to dispose of it safely, which underscores the irony,” she said.

The chief minister had also promised that over 500 affected people under the age of 18, identified as the victims through medical camps in 2017, would be included in the list without further medical check-up, and those above 18 would be included after medical check-up, but nothing has append so far, said Muneesa.

There is concern that the government is going back from the promises and the benefits announced for the victims would be stopped one by one, said Munnani convenor Ambalathara Kunhikrishnan.

“Though it is said that Rs 19 crore has been earmarked for the victims, there is no clarity about it and even if the fund has been earmarked, how it will be utilized by the administration is also a question,” he said.

The victims have no other way than continuing agitation to call the attention of the authorities, he added.

Nashik: The civic body will hire a private agency for scientifically uprooting and transplanting over 50 trees that are located either in the middle or edges of different roads in the city.

“These trees have to be carefully uprooted and transplanted to ensure their survival. Hence, the Nashik Municipal Corporation has decided to engage a private agency to carry out the task,” said NMC officials.

The civic body is in the process of inviting bids from interested parties for the work.

“The party winning the bid would have to carry out the task in a time-bound the manner and they have to ensure that these trees survive at the new location,” said NMC officials.

The private agency would be given about two years to complete the task.

The city police last year had written to NMC drawing its attention to accidents caused due to those trees. NMC’s tree authority committee in November had approved the civic administration’s plan to relocate these trees elsewhere following its proposal on the issue.

According to the police, these trees pose danger to motorists, especially at night. There have been accidents where motorists have dashed against the trees sustaining injuries, some have even lost their lives. A couple of policemen were injured while returning home during wee hours.

NMC sources said these trees cannot be chopped off as the tree authority has asked the civic administration to transplant them. According to some traffic police officials, the relocation of these trees is imperative to make the roads safer.

The environmentalists have demanded that NMC must direct the private agency to seek the guidance of experts about the transplantation for the survival of the trees.

Coimbatore: Residents of Pillayarpuram near Kuniyamuthur in the city on Monday urged the district administration to convert the aided elementary school in their locality into a government school, instead of shutting it down. They also petitioned district collector K Rajamani in this regard.

Set up in 1986, Bethel Livesey Memorial aided school initially had a strength of close to 1,000 students, said M Arun Kumar, one of the petitioners.

Pointing out that the school education department had not been renewing the school’s recognition for the past few years, he said as a result the student strength has plunged to 14 presently.

Arun said there were 2,000 families in the locality and that parents would admit their wards to the school, if it was turned into a government school. “It will help the school regain its recognition. While there are two government schools within 3km radius, residents are scared to send their children to those schools as they have to cross two highway roads to reach there.”

The school education department had sent a notice to the school management in 2018, directing them to get building stability certificate for the school. It had subsequently issued a final notice in July 2019, directing them to close the school by the end of the academic year.

Following this, the school management decided to handover the school to the government and has submitted a letter stating the same to the school education department.

When contacted, an official with the office of district educational officer (Perur) said the school was constructed on government poramboke land and that the school management had not paid the lease amount for more than 10 years. “The pending lease amount will come around Rs 1 crore. Now that only 14 students are there, we have sent a notice to the school directing them to close it by the end of the academic year.”

When asked about the possibility of converting it into a government school, the official said a final decision was yet to be taken. “The decision would have to be taken by the directorate of school education.”

Jaipur: Thousands, including politicians, ministers and locals on Monday bid a tearful adieu to Rajiv Singh (36) who was killed during the unprovoked firing at Poonch sector of J&K. As the mortal remains of Singh were consigned to flames by his son Adhiraj Singh people shouted patriotic and anti-Pakistan slogans at Luhakana Khurd village near Viratnagar on the city outskirts.

Singh joined the Indian Army in 2002 and had joined his duty on January 8 after a long vacation. Family members including father Shankar Singh, mother Pushpa Kanwar and wife Usha Kanwar have been inconsolable ever since they got the tragic news.

Everyone had tears in their eyes when Singh’s sister Seema Kanwar tied Rakhi on his wrist prior to consigning the mortal remains to flames. “I have lost my father because of Pakistan. I too will join the Indian Army to teach a lesson to Pakistan,” said Adhiraj Singh.

When the funeral procession was taken from the village lanes people shouted, ‘Rajiv Singh Amar Rahey’ ‘Pakistan Murdabad’ ‘Rajiv Tera Yeh Balidan Yaad Karega Hindustan’. People went to the terraces of houses, shops and schools to bid adieu.

Some of the youths also organised a tri-colour rally on bikes across the village.

“My grandson is also willing to join Indian army to serve the country and to teach a lesson to Pakistan. Though I lost my son but I’m proud of the fact that he sacrificed his life for the country,” said Shankar Singh, the deceased’s father.

274,['11/02/2020'],I have limited time to deliver today and dream for tomorrow: CM,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Vijayawada: Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy , in his first media interaction since coming to power in May last year, said he has limited time to “deliver today and dream for tomorrow” to ensure that the state meets its welfare and development goals. The CM spoke on a range of issues, including his government’s achievements in the last eight months, bifurcation of capital, abolition of legislative council and his plans for the rest of his term. Excerpts:

You have brought in a number of welfare schemes . But how do you plan to bring in investments?

Welfare schemes are my commitment to people. Every scheme is the result of my interaction with them, be it Rythu Bharosa or Amma Vodi or any other scheme. This government is committed to ensure industrial growth in the state. We are giving corruption-free governance, we are offering land, water and electricity to investors. Applications are being cleared fast, the investors do not have to run around offices for permissions. We are inviting some, some are coming in on their own. The previous government had promised Rs 4,000 crore worth incentives and we have to honour it. Before setting up new industries, we should retain the existing ones. We can’t offer more incentives merely for the sake of inviting new industries and fail to deliver as my predecessor did.

The state’s finances are not in good shape. How do you plan to raise revenue?

It is true that the state’s fiscal position is poor. My predecessor had not only emptied the exchequer but also left a huge burden on me. He ( Chandrababu Naidu ) went for maximum borrowing at high rates of interest. But we have still been able to manage welfare schemes and development with limited sources. If we can balance it in the first year, we can do it in the remaining four years. I am confident God will help us.

Some of your decisions are under judicial review...

Nothing can stop us from doing what we are planning. I have invited judicial review on some of my decisions like tenders. My government has no hidden agenda. Things will fall in line when they are planned for people’s welfare and the state’s development.

Your father revived the legislative council. Why did you decide to abolish it?

The council was created by the legislative assembly to be a guiding force. When that spirit is defeated, and rules are flouted for political benefit, why should the assembly accept the council? The council should have understood people’s mandate and honoured the assembly’s decisions. Moreover, I could have got majority in the council by next year. But I don’t have that much time.

But the reason and timing of your decision is being criticised...

No, it was the right time and right reason. The council can delay a decision by maximum three to four months. They can’t stop the assembly’s work (Bills) for more than that stipulated period. But three to four months is too long a time for me. I have to dream and deliver whatever I promised and whatever people want in five years. I can’t waste precious time for political interests that the council members have. Take for example, the English medium issue. It can’t wait as the academic year starts in June and we have to prepare teachers and schools by then. If one party wants us to stop our work at every step for its political interests, we can’t wait.

What is your biggest challenge as chief minister?

Planning for future generations is important. I have taken up modernization of schools, hospitals and farming. ‘Nadu-Nedu’ for schools and hospitals is a big challenge. You will see the difference when basic infrastructure is provided to schools and hospitals. Even agriculture is going to get a facelift. Rythu Bharosa kendras in every village, soil testing centres in every assembly constituency and market yards are going to change the scene. This government plans to give tough competition to private buyers in the market.

Visakhapatnam is cyclone-prone. Is it safe to have the capital there?

Of the 13 districts in the state, nine are along the coast and cyclone threat is everywhere. Diviseema in Krishna district was badly hit in 1977. Why only Visakhapatnam? Machilipatnam, Nizampatnam are equally prone to cyclones. Even Kakinada. But we have to live with that. Chennai is along the coast like Visakhapatnam and there is no problem. Moreover, we are not going to disturb the existing city. We would be adding to this city a little away from the sea shore.

What is the reason behind selecting Visakhapatnam as executive capital when Amaravati was decided by the previous government?

AP is a new state and we have big capital cities in the neighbourhood to compete with. We should select an existing city to develop and join the competition and not invest on building a new capital. Amaravati is still a village and it will take decades to compete with Chennai, Bengaluru or Hyderabad, whereas Visakhapatnam is an existing city and it will be ready for competition with any of these three capitals in less than 10 years. I don’t want the youth of AP to look at other cities for opportunities. Their capital should be able to live up to their expectations soon. We don’t have to wait for 50 years for Amaravati to become a city and then compete with other capitals. Visakhapatnam would start challenging Chennai in no time, with less investment.

Your police have found a major land scam in Amaravati land pooling scheme. Who is behind this?

The previous government committed several such mistakes. The CID had conducted an initial investigation and handed over the details to the enforcement directorate (ED). We are also thinking of constituting a special investigating team (SIT) as requested by assembly speaker Thammineni Sitaram. Those who have indulged in insider trading will be punished as per the law of the land.

What are you going to do with Amaravati and its 33,000 acres of land taken from farmers?

Amaravati will continue to be the legislative capital of the state. The chief minister, ministers, MLAs and officials will be here for 60 to 70 days in a year. The assembly will remain here. We have increased the annuity period from 10 years to 15 years. We have enhanced agriculture labourers’ pension from Rs 2,500 to Rs 5,000 per month. We have promised to give equal share to ‘B’ form lands on par with patta lands. We are promising proper utilisation of land collected from farmers. The development will take its due course.

Is special category status demand still in your agenda?

It’s very much there in our agenda. There is no going back on it. Special category status for AP was promised on the floor of the Parliament. But, they (BJP) should have the same commitment to fulfil it. BJP leaders may say SCS is a closed chapter, but it is very much alive for us and for the people of AP. We thought the BJP would fall short of numbers (in Parliament) and would require our support. It did not happen and they have full majority. But we will not give up and keep asking for SCS.

What about Polavaram project?

It took us some time to correct the mistakes of the previous government. They constructed the cofferdam without completing the spill channel, which caused inundation of the project site and the new contractor could not take up the works. But I am confident of completing the irrigation component of the project as per schedule, by June 2021.

Your plans for the remaining four-and-a-half years of your government?

I have to take care of every part of the state, not just one place. Amaravati, as it is, and as estimated by the previous government, would require Rs 1.09 lakh crore. The previous government had spent only Rs 6,000 crore or a little more. But we can’t think of spending Rs 1.09 lakh crore in one place. For head of the family, every person in the family is important. Likewise, for the head of the state, every part of the state is important. Health, education, agriculture and industries are my priorities. We will plan and spend accordingly.

Tarapur police said the teens are out of danger. The friends, all aged 18, sustained injuries when their car turned turtle.

Tarapur police have booked driver Hritik Sharma (18) for the death of Laxman Wavre (30) who worked as a garden contractor with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre Colony in Tarapur. Sharma does not have a driving licence.

The incident took place around 7.20am when Sharma and his four friends, including two girls, all Class XI students of a junior college in Boisar, decided to bunk lectures and go for a drive to Chinchani, a beach destination at Boisar.

They were in their college uniform when the accident took place.

Sharma, who is believed to have borrowed the car from a friend—who was not travelling with them—was speeding down the road. When he reached Kurgaon village, he rammed into the bike. Wavre, the biker who was wearing a helmet, was thrown at a distance and died on the spot.

A resident of Popharan village in Boisar, Wavre was on his way to work. He was identified based on his identity card found in his pocket. His family was informed by locals. Sharma tried to control his vehicle but it turned turtle and rammed into a tree. Eyewitnesses said the teens were pulled out of the car by locals.

Sharma and his two male friends sustained head and body injuries. The two girls, on rear seats, suffered minor injuries. All five are being treated at Boisar’s Anand Hospital. API Santosh Jadhav said Sharma is booked under IPC and Motor Vehicles Act. He will be arrested after his release from hospital. The car owner was summoned.

276,['11/02/2020'],"Three BBMP staffers, 2 others siphon off Rs 4.2 crore from agency","This story is from February 11, 2020

BBMP employees allegedly colluded with two individuals to divert the civic agency’s payment of Rs 4.2 crore.

BENGALURU: Three BBMP employees allegedly colluded with two individuals to divert the civic agency’s payment of Rs 4.2 crore to a contractor towards execution of road work in KR Puram, according to an FIR registered with the Bengaluru Metropolitan Task Force police station. The amount was allegedly transferred to the account of an unrelated individual.

Acting on the complaint lodged on February 12 by BBMP chief accounts officer Govindaraju R, BMTF police have named accounts superintendents Anitha M, 48, and Ramamurthy R, 50, second division clerk Raghavendra, and two others, Gangadhar, 38, and Nagesh, 36, as the accused. All three Palike employees worked in the agency’s headquarters and have been suspended.

The complaint was lodged in the wake of the letter from contractor CG Chandrappa, director, CGC Infra Project Pvt Ltd, to BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar.

Chandrappa’s firm had won the tender for executing road improvement and resurfacing work worth Rs 4.4 crore in several localities of KR Puram. Two work orders were issued to the firm on September 15, 2018.

“I finished the project in time and as per the standards and specification mentioned in the tender,” said Chandrappa. He had provided a cancelled cheque of his firm to the BBMP executive engineer for transfer of payments.

“After audit and deduction, the BBMP executive engineer said I would receive Rs 4.2 crore towards the two work orders,” Chandrappa said.

“I was to get the money earlier this February. But I got suspicious when it didn’t arrive in my account for over a week. I went to the head office and learnt the money for the work had been transferred to another account in Janatha Seva Cooperative Bank, Vijayanagar,” said Chandrappa.

A senior BBMP official said the accused opened an account in the bank using fake documents and transferred the money to it instead of the account of Chandrappa’s firm.

BMTF police said they have arrested the four accused. A special team headed by Obalesh, SP, is investigating the case. “We have recovered Rs 3.9 crore and it will be handed over to Chandrappa. We will recover the remaining amount soon,” said mayor M Goutham Kumar.

HYDERABAD : The Telangana high court on Monday issued notices to the state, its higher education secretary, the University Grants Commission (UGC) and to vice-chancellors of several universities in the state asking them to explain their stand on a public interest petition that questioned the state’s decision to appoint IAS officers as in-charge vice chancellors of various universities.The petitioner, Dr S Karunakar Reddy — an assistant professor of Osmania University , also questioned an office note issued by the chief minister’s office (CMO) on July 24, 2019 that facilitated the entry of IAS officers as in-charge VCs of scores of universities in the state.The petitioner sought the suspension of this CMO note and make senior faculty members of respective universities as in-charge VCs till permanent VCs are appointed as per UGC norms.“Universities are supposed to function independently and maintain high academic standards. But governmental intervention would prove to be detrimental to the autonomy of the varsities,” the petitioner said.“The only way available to the authorities to make these appointments is through UGC regulations 2010 and 2018 as was directed by the Supreme Court and was also adopted by the state government,” he added.The petitioner contended that in several universities, executive coucils have not been in place for the last five years. “The annual budget for these universities are getting cut and areas of teaching and research are being adversely affected,” he said and added that though the state has sanctioned a thousand teaching posts — 600 assistant professors and 400 associate professor posts — three years ago, the notification to fill them has not yet been given.“This is because the IAS officers who are working as in-charge VCs do not have enough time to deal with these important tasks,” he said.The bench gave the state four weeks to explain its case.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74074837,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-156693,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/plea-in-hc-seeks-removal-of-ias-officers-from-vc-posts/articleshow/74071765.cms

279,['11/02/2020'],Savadi’s push for Hungarian firm’s electric buses raises eyebrows,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Bengaluru: The controversy over expensive electric buses seems to be never-ending in Karnataka.

After the previous coalition government and then transport minister DC Thamanna landed in soup over purchasing electric buses rather than leasing them on long-term basis, incumbent deputy chief minister and transport minister Laxman Savadi ’s hope to induct electric buses from a Hungarian firm — bypassing the tender process — has raised eyebrows.

Last month, Savadi said the Hungarian company had pitched an “attractive” proposal for the Karnataka government after having successfully sold it to Assam, Harayana and Maharashtra in the last one year when they were under the BJP regime.

“We are quite impressed with the Hungarian firm’s proposal of leasing buses to us. However, they are outside the tendering process and we are considering their proposal,” Savadi had said, claiming the company was on the verge of signing an MoU with Maharashtra and had presented a letter of intent to Assam.

Recent reports suggest Assam State Transport Corporation will induct 1,000 such buses shortly.

Accordingly, transport department sources say they are planning to do away with floating tenders by seeking 4G exemption under the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement Act. “There is a pressure to induct e-buses from the Hungarian company without floating tenders. The firm is not eligible to participate in tenders since it has no prior experience in operating e-buses in India. If the minister is convinced, then he could induct buses on lease basis without any tender,” said a senior transport department official.

But 4G exemption can be used only under extraneous circumstances (see box).

The firm has reportedly proposed different slab rates: Rs 6,500 per bus per day (32 seater), Rs 13,000 per bus/day (53) and Rs 14,000 per bus/day (88). It also offered buses on inter-city routes: Rs 21,000 (36-sleeper) and Rs 25,000 (42-sleeper). All buses will be air-conditioned.

Unlike other firms, the Hungarian company quoted the rate on per bus per day basis. Normally, firms quote rates on a per kilometre basis.

However, an addition which the firm brings to the table is that of investments to set up its manufacturing unit in Mangaluru. It has already identified 250 acres of land near Mangaluru airport for the purpose.

What does 4G exemption entail?

Exceptions to applicability of KTPP Act, clause 4 (exemption from tender process)

* During natural calamity or if emergency goods or services are available from a single source

* Where additional goods must be procured from same supplier for reasons of standardisation and compatibility

* Where value of goods or services does not exceed Rs 1 lakh

* Where goods or services are procured under rate contracts from the director-general of supplies and disposals

* In respect of specific procurements as may be notified by the government from time to time

281,['11/02/2020'],Karnataka: Doubling of 2 railway lines hits hurdle,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Representative image

BENGALURU: The long-pending doubling of two crucial railway lines — Byappanahalli-Hosur (48km) and Yeshwantpur-Channasandra (21km) — has once again hit a hurdle. Sources say the railways now wants to rework the cost-sharing.

After the state government refused to shoulder 50% of the cost burden, the railways agreed to take up the projects under the 20:20 model, where the remaining 60% was to be raised through loans.

However, the railways again began insisting on a 50:50 cost-sharing model but the state said it’s ready for a 20:20 formula as the projects will only help railways operate long-distance trains.

Sources said the railways and state government are yet to reach a consensus, which may further delay the project.

The railways in 2018 invited bids for civil work on doubling of the Byappanahalli-Hosur line . With the state government insisting that these projects be taken up through a special purpose vehicle, the railways in 2019 handed over the two projects to Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises, which is recruiting 37 officials to execute them.

“The source of revenue from these two projects is not clear so it’s difficult to quantify the rate of returns. In this scenario, financial institutions are unlikely to be keen on these projects. We are hoping the railways and state agree on a 50:50 cost-sharing model and resolve this issue in a month,” said a K-RIDE official.

A senior state government official said: “After agreeing to the 20:20 model, we don’t know why railways did a U-turn. In fact, the Rs 18,600 crore dedicated suburban rail system is also under the same model and we wanted the same SPV to take up these projects too. The projects largely help the railways operate long-distance trains since the extends till Hosur in Tamil Nadu.”

Once the railways and state are on the same page, it will take another three-four months to float new tenders. It will take three or four years to complete the doubling work.

While doubling of these two lines was proposed several years ago, it remained on paper even though the lines pass through high-density corridors like Outer Ring Road and tech hubs like Electronics City. Doubling could help the railways operate more trains, including suburban services, particularly between Byappanahalli and Heelalige stations, which would spell relief for techies working along Hosur Road, ORR, Sarjapur Road and Electronics City who battle road traffic every day. Traffic congestion on ORR is likely to worsen once BMRCL commences the construction of Metro corridors. The railways has allocated only Rs 5 crore each to the two projects in its Pink Book.

Will reduce traffic

Doubling of these two lines will significantly reduce traffic along ORR from Silk Board to Hebbal. It would be a big achievement if the railways is able to double these lines in three years. It was announced in the 2018 budget but there’s been no progress for two years

BENGALURU: Sri Gururaghavendra Sahakara Bank Niyamitha (SGRSBN), a co-operative bank in Basavanagudi, has filed a complaint against its chief adviser for disbursing loans worth several crores of rupees in violation of norms. It hit the headlines after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed a cap on withdrawals of its customers.

SGRSBN chief executive officer (CEO) Santosh Kumar A filed the complaint against Vasudev Maiya, chief advisor, at Banaswadi police station, accusing him of lending loans by violating bank norms. According to the complaint, RBI during its auditing said loans for five people were given in violation of norms, which led to the crisis. Banaswadi police registered an FIR on Friday.

Maiya, who’s been working with the bank since 2000, was elevated as CEO in 2012 and retired in 2018. He continued to work as chief adviser. Sources said the case was registered on RBI’s directive. On January 10, RBI had capped withdrawals from SGRSBN at Rs 35,000 for six months over non-performing assets (NPAs).

The complaint said, “Maiya has caused a loss of several crores of rupees to the bank and is in syndicate with a few borrowers like Jaswanth Reddy, Ashok Reddy, Ranjith Reddy, M/s Megatex and Naveen DP/Geetha Naveen.”

Santosh added in the complaint: “As per the recent inspection by RBI, it was found that Maiya illegally sanctioned and disbursed loans to several people to cheat the bank and its depositors. He misused his position in the bank with the criminal intention of siphoning off several crores of rupees of depositors’ money. Maiya committed breach of trust and routed the funds fraudulently by dodging the bank accounts.”

Banaswadi police have registered a case under sections of Karnataka Protection of Interest Depositors Exorbitant Act and IPC. Santosh chose not to comment as police probe is under way.

284,['11/02/2020'],VC aspirants await government call as panel sits on applications,"This story is from February 11, 2020

HYDERABAD: Even after four months of constituting search committees, the Telangana government is yet to commence screening of applications for appointment of vice-chancellors (VCs) for the nine state universities. On July 24, 2019, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had appointed senior bureaucrats as in-charge VCs of the universities after seven academicians had retired from the post. The term of the ninth VC at Prof Jayashankar Telangana State University was extended by three years.

The government had constituted search committees for appointment of VCs in September last year and had received nearly 984 applications from 273 candidates for the nine VC posts. Subsequently, the search committees were expected to screen all the applications and recommend three names for each post to the Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, who is also chancellor of all the state universities. The governor will have final call on appointment of VCs.

However, sources said that the search committees are yet to commence screening of applications as they have not received any communication from the state government following its constitution. “A meeting of all search committees was expected to be held around the end of 2019. While a meeting was organised in October-November, the same was subsequently postponed without giving us any reason,” said a member of a search committee.

Search committee members claimed that the government has not informed them on the number of applications it had received. “The government was expected to conduct preliminary screening following which they were supposed to hand over the applications to us. Ever since the constitution of the committee, not even a single meeting has been convened to discuss the time-line and other modalities of scrutinising applications,” said the search committee member.

Top bureaucrats have attributed the delay to the model code of conduct due to municipal elections in Telangana. On the other hand, teachers claim that the state universities are yet again lying headless due to the state government’s delay in appointing the VCs. Even in 2015, the government had appointed regular VCs after a gap of over two years. The varsities were headed by IAS officers for almost two years until the government appointed VCs in 2015.

“For the past two to three months, every time we question the authorities, they inform us that the process will be completed in a month. However, till date, there has been no progress on the matter,” said Battu Satyanarayana , retired professor of the OU.

HYDERABAD: Diploma courses have gained increasing popularity in Telangana with the state seeing 65% rise in enrolments over the last five years. According to figures from the All India Survey on Higher Education, 72,123 students had enrolled for diploma courses in academic year 2014-15 which increased to 1.28 lakh in 2017-18.

There are total 47 diploma courses offered by Telangana State Board of Technical Education and Training ( TSBET ). These courses offer students education and expertise in fields such as textiles, packaging, hotel management among others. Officials have attributed the rise in number of students pursuing diploma courses to industry-relevance and employment opportunities.

Students from across boards—CBSE, ISC and the state— with a focus on engineering and other competitive exams are now opting for these diploma programmes since most of them have focused courses on engineering. “While majority students pursue computer, mechanical and other engineering-based diploma courses to secure lateral entry into BTech/BE, there are also others who opt for footwear technology, hotel management and catering, packaging technology, textile technology among others,” said TSBET secretary, UVSN Murthy .

Rising demand for diploma courses has also been attributed to a decreasing popularity of degree courses. Changes in the diploma curriculum by TSBET last year has also contributed to its growing popularity.

BENGALURU: The owner of the Lamborghini Gallardo, who posed for a photograph at the accident site a few hours after he ploughed his green car into a traffic police kiosk, was arrested on Monday.

The accused is Sunny Sabharwal, 28, one of the directors of city-based Fun World and Resorts India Private Limited. Cubbon Park police booked him for rash and negligent driving and slapped a penalty of Rs 2,000 on him.

Sunny, a resident of RT Nagar, had taken the car (PY05 B4345) for a spin in central business district (CBD) on Sunday evening. He had come from the MG Road side and was proceeding towards Raj Bhavan around 5pm when he lost control while drifting. The car rammed the concrete traffic police kiosk.

The impact of the crash was such that it created a 2x3 feet gaping hole in the kiosk and left the car’s front portion completely damaged. The furniture inside the kiosk was also broken. Fortunately, no constable was present in the kiosk when the crash happened. With fellow motorists and passersby rushing to the spot, the Lamborghini driver was lost in the crowd and police struggled to establish his identity.

Following the incident, joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda set up a special team led by DCP (traffic-east) M Narayana to trace the errant driver. The cops collected CCTV footage and other evidence pertaining to the case when they learnt about a man having uploaded a photo in which he’s seen standing in front of the damaged kiosk and showing a thumbs-up. Based on the information, police identified him as Sunny Sabharwal.

“Sunny is a member of a WhatsAapp group with young businessmen and entrepreneurs from across the country. With pictures and videos of the post-crash scene going viral, Sunny started receiving queries from his friends who were eager to know if he was fine. He decided to answer them by visiting the kiosk and taking a picture, which he posted on social media,” police said.

On Monday morning, a police team visited Sunny’s residence in RT Nagar and the family members reportedly tried to convince the cops that he wasn’t behind the wheel when the accident occurred. However, the team showed them the CCTV footage and Sunny’s photograph. He appeared before Cubbon Park traffic police in the afternoon and was arrested.

287,['11/02/2020'],Poor frequency discourages many from taking public transport: B.Pac survey,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Bengaluru: As many as 33% of respondents in a survey said lack of frequent public transport services in the city is the reason they use private vehicles .

The Bangalore Political Action Committee (B.Pac) online survey was on first-and last-mile connectivity to public transport in Bengaluru

Poor first-and last-mile connectivity was why 24% of the respondents said they used private transport. Other factors discouraging people from travelling in public transport included accessibility (22%), convenience (19%) and affordability (3%).

Alternative modes of transport of those not using public transport are 83% (personal mobility), 16% (shared mobility) and 1% (rental mobility).

The survey revealed 88% men use personal mobility compared to 63% women, reflecting that more men hold driving licences in the city. In fact, more women (37%) use shared mobility than men (11%). Among public transport users, 51% use shared mobility, 44% personal mobility and 5% rental mobility for first-mile connectivity. For last-mile connectivity, 68% used shared mobility and 6% rental mobility.

“Differences were observed in the travel pattern of men and women in choosing modes for first- mile connectivity: 65% of the women said they prefer shared mobility – auto, cabs, shared cabs to access public transport whereas 50% of the men preferred private vehicles for first-mile connectivity,” said the report.

“Connecting Transit Stations (bus/Metro/suburban rail) to high footfall locations emerged as another urgent and immediate priority. New-age mobility service providers in the city have been working on solutions to address this first-and last-mile gap. At present, app-based bike taxis, rental bikes/cycles, shared cabs and carpooling are options to cover the first and last leg of the journey. However, not all public transit stations at present have parking facilities for app-based rental vehicles,” the report released by B.PAC read, proposing to allow shared autos.

Multimodal integration of all public transit modes in the city would enable service providers to build solutions to close the first-and last-mile gap, it said.

Times View

These statistics are interesting and they reinforce the importance of managing end-point connectivity to decongest Bengaluru. While startups in the mobility service space have been tackling this problem, the government can’t expect them to do everything. Mobility providers need to be encouraged and usage of public transport should be incentivised further. Most importantly, there’s a need for reliability — in terms of frequent services, priority bus lanes and more Metro coaches. Piecemeal approaches will not work any longer; a comprehensive plan that takes into account the city’s past and future growth needs to be drawn up and implemented.

CEO of the Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) Prakash Thavil said that securing a high rank among 100 cities under Smart City Mission is praiseworthy. “It will give boost to the entire team involved in the implementation of the projects related to Smart City,” he added.

Some other cities that have found place in the top-20 performing smart cities include Ahmedabad, Nagpur, Tiruppur, Ranchi, Bhopal, Surat, Kanpur, Indore, Visakhapatnam, Vellore, Vadodara, Agra, Varanasi, Indore and Pune.

MoHUA sources said the ministry had undertaken internal assessment of the overall performances about implementation of projects based on the weekly progress of the projects over a period of time.

“Based on these assessments the ministry has ranked the cities in the manner the projects are planned, tenders & work orders issued, status of projects, among others.”

The ministry has decided that each of these top-20 cities would pair with the worst performing 20 cities.

“We have been given the responsibility of guiding the Jammu municipal body for implementing projects. Initially a team of officials from the Jammu civic body would visit Nashik so that we can explain to them the manner in which projects are planned and implemented,” Thavil said.

The ranking of Nashik among the top-20 cities come at a time when the NMSCDCL has received flak from various quarters about the implementation of the city’s maiden smart road.

Karnal: The first case of yellow rust on the wheat crop this season has been detected in Karnal district, confirmed an official of the state agriculture department on Monday.

Soon after getting information, the district agriculture and farmers’ welfare department swung into action and a team comprising assistant plant protection officer (APPO) Suresh and agriculture development officer (ADO) Rakesh Kumar inspected the affected fields in Nalvikhurd village, Indri sub-division, on Sunday and confirmed the fungal disease on wheat.

“We got information about the disease on Sunday morning. We visited the fields and found around four acres of wheat crop of farmers Amit and Sandeep Kumar affected. The disease has been identified at an initial stage and under control. The farmers have sprayed propiconazole,” APPO Suresh said.

The farmers, he said, had sown HD-2851 variety of wheat. “We have already launched an awareness campaign among farmers and intensified surveys to identify more areas. It will be controlled in time,” he said. The district agriculture department has issued an advisory to farmers too.

Farm department’s sub-divisional officer Sunil Kumar Bazad advised farmers to inspect their fields every day. He said if they find yellow rust, farmers should spray 200 ml of propiconazole in 200 litres of water in the affected fields. Cases of yellow rust attack have been reported in Ambala, Panchkula, Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar districts too.

HYDERABAD: The latest to be hit by the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019 n-CoV) in China is Telangana ’s thriving granite industry. Industry sources said sales of at least 15,000 cubic metres of granite had been put on hold. This has resulted in a loss of around Rs 100 crore.With Chinese businessmen who othewise frequent granite quarrying units in Karimnagar, Warangal and Khammam in January and February confined in their country, trading took a beating. “Chinese traders come to these districts every month. In March, China conducts a big international exhibition where their businessmen buy more granite from us in January and February alone. We sold 15,000 cubic metres of granite for which they paid up to Rs 20,000 per cubic metre this season. The loss is estimated to be around Rs 100 crore,” Telangana Smallscale Granite Industries’ Association president R Nageswara Rao told TOI.Industry sources said Telangana along with Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka exports quality granite to several countries, including China and Taiwan. A major chunk of exports from Telangana go to China, while Rajasthan, Mumbai and Delhi are leading importers of granite. “Around 20% of our business depends on exports to China. We can manage with (revenues) through the domestic market for some time but our main profits accrue from exports to China,” said a trader from Karimnagar.Adding to traders’ woes, the Centre has also prohibited Chinese traders from coming to Bengaluru where an international exhibition took place recently.With granite quarry owners losing business, the industry is also suffering from lack of movement between the two countries with import of many tools used in the granite making stopped as a result of the coronavirus outbreak . This is likely to hit several small-scale industries in the state.“There won’t be any improvement in the situation for at least a year. If this persists, only 10% of the industry will survive. This is a big threat as the granite industry survices on exports. There is a possibility that many of them may become non-performing assets (NPAs),” said Yerram Raju of the Telangana Industrial Health Clinic Limited.“For instance, the Hyderabad international airport has been built using furnished granite from China but the raw stone had gone from here,” he added.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74072975,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-264085,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/granite-biz-hits-corona-bump-down-by-rs-100cr/articleshow/74071816.cms

KRISHNAGIRI: A 39-year-old man murdered his wife by slitting her throat near Veppanahalli here in the early hours of Monday over a family dispute .

Police identified the deceased as N Priya, 35, of Gangojikothur village. She was a homemaker.

An investigation officer said Priya was a native of Chennai and that she had been married to V Natarajan, a car driver, for more than five years. The couple have a five-year-old son.

“They had been moving around Chennai, Bengaluru and Hosur as part of their works, before settling down in Hosur along with Natarajan’s parents,” the officer said.

Priya, the officer said, was employed with a private hospital in Hosur. “She lost her job in January. Her husband too was not doing well at work. Some 15 days ago, Priya and Natarajan had picked up a quarrel over remaining jobless and after that she had left for Chennai to live with her mother.”

However, Natarajan managed to pacify her and brought her back home on Sunday morning. But they entered into another big fight the same night. “At one stage, Natarajan slit Priya’s throat using a knife, killing her on the spot,” the officer said.

Natarajan then told his parents that he had murdered his wife and they alerted the neighbours, who called in the Veppanahalli police.

Police held inquiry with Natarajan, who confessed to the crime. They registered a case based on his confessional statement and arrested him. He was subsequently lodged in the Salem Central Prison under judicial custody in the evening.

The Veppanahalli police, meanwhile, sent the dead body to the Krishnagiri government hospital for postmortem.

Times News Network

Jaipur: The health department has decided to generate awareness on organ donation at the gram panchayat level, the move coming barely a month after the SMS Hospital conducted its first cadaver heart transplant on January 16.

The state plans to rope in swasthya mitras under Nirogi Rajasthan scheme to spread awareness on organ donation. There are 40,000-odd villages in the state with each having two swasthya mitras — a man and a woman.

“We will deploy 80,000 swasthya mitras at all the gram panchayats under Nirogi Rajasthan. For each village, we will identify a man and a woman. We are planning to promote organ donation at the grassroots level,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary, health department.

These swasthya mitras will be deployed in every village with a purpose to bridge the gap between the health department and patients and to promote health schemes.

Apart from the existing fleet of auxiliary nurse midwives, ASHA and anganwadi workers in every village, the health department is gearing up to deploy a different sort of ‘force’ in the village.

The swasthya mitras, who will be trained in national and state’s health programmes, should have the knowledge of health and medical policies launched by the state government.

Palakkad: The soft drink giant , Pepsi Cola closed its bottling plant at Kanjikode industrial area from Friday due to the strike by nearly 200 contract labourers of a Labour supply company.

The company management has moved the Kerala High Court for police protection as the striking contract workers had allegedly attacked a manager and a driver of the company and prevented the movement of products and stopped the management and staff from entering the company.

The sources in the company management said that the workers did not allow the management staff to come out of the company after their shift.

The management is seriously thinking of closing the unit and bringing the products to Kerala from its plants in the neighbouring Tamil Nadu, the sources said. They said that Pepsi Cola India Limited that was running the company gave the plant to Varun Breweries to run, due to the loss it’s units were facing in different parts of the country.

The management sources said that the contract workers went on strike because the wage revision issue was pending with the regional labour commissioner.

Many major industrial units were closed despite industries minister E P Jayarajan announcing that an Industrial Felicitation Centre would be set up at Kanjikode and declaring that all those industrial units that had shifted its units to the neighbouring states will be brought back during his visit to Kanjikode on January 27, 2020. While inaugurating the adalat at Palakkad collectorate on January 26 the minister said, “the LDF government is trying to attract industries to Kerala to prove that the state is industrial friendly.”

Because of the picketing and strike by the contract workers more than 250 permanent workers are not allowed to enter the company for work. The company provides direct and indirect employment to nearly 1,000 persons. The contract workers are on strike demanding wage hike. They are paid Rs 605 daily plus PF and ESI benefits. The contracting company offered to hike Rs 25 per day but the workers are demanding a hike of Rs 200 per day. But in other plants of the company in the neighbouring states the contract workers are paid Rs 250 to Rs 300 per day.

Salem: Ten organs of a brain-dead man were harvested at the Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital (SGMKMCH) in the city on Monday. The organs were donated to hospitals in Salem, Coimbatore and Chennai.

Hospital dean Dr Balajinathan said, “We have harvested 10 organs from J Surendar, 20, of Perumangalam village in Kallakurichi district.”

He said the victim had met with an accident on February 8 at Yethapur near Vazhapadi in Salem district and admitted to the hospital.

P Jayakumar, father of the victim, told reporters that doctors at the hospital had declared his son brain-dead on Sunday.

“The family members immediately agreed to donate the victim’s organs to the needy,” Dr Balajinathan said.

A team of doctors harvested eyes, kidneys, lungs, liver, heart, spinal bones and skins from the victim’s body.

He said heart and lungs were donated to a private hospital in Chennai, while the kidneys were given to private hospitals in Salem and Coimbatore. “Bone and skins were given to another private hospital in Coimbatore and the lungs were given to a private hospital in Salem,” he said.

After completing the organ harvesting procedure, the doctors handed over the body to Jayakumar.

Meanwhile, the Salem city police made elaborated arrangements to transport lungs and heart to the airport at Kamalapuram near Omalur from Salem city to be taken to Chennai.

“The airport is 22km away from the government hospital and the team of doctors reached the airport within 15 minutes,” T Senthil Kumar, Salem city police commissioner, told TOI.

The commissioner said they had deployed police personnel for governor’s security to make arrangements. “So, it was easy for us to transport the vital organs to the airport,” he said, adding that the traffic was halted between the stretch for a while.

Chennai: The state election commission is likely to hold elections to the urban local bodies in Tamil Nadu in April, sources said.

The AIADMK leaders chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam on Monday convened a meeting of party functionaries, including ministers and MLAs, and issued a stern directive about putting an end to internal squabbles for the forthcoming civic polls to the urban local bodies.

The party leadership took serious note of the factional feud taking a toll on the party’s poll prospects. “The election to urban local bodies will take place in April, while the newly-constituted nine districts will go to polls after delimitation. So the party is gearing up for polls,” said a source.

The four-day long meeting began in the morning at the AIADMK headquarters in Chennai. EPS and OPS met functionaries led by their secretaries, district-wise. Most of the district secretaries are ministers. Among the first batch were the delta districts, including Karur, Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Pudukkottai and Perambalur. Barring Karur, the party fared poorly in the delta belt in the rural local body elections.

The secretaries of the districts that put up a poor show in the civic polls and where the DMK and its allies scored handsomely were pulled up. “Thanjavur functionaries pointed to AMMK denting their prospects in many areas,” said a party functionary.

The functionaries pointed to the party’s stand on the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act and National Population Register as one of the reasons for losing minority votes, even as the opposition was exerting pressure on the government to pass a resolution in the assembly against it.

“The leadership also tried to pep up morale of the functionaries and ready them for the 2021 polls. They said losses and gains were part of life and that we should strive for future victories. Announcements in the upcoming budget session will give the party a boost,” said a minister, seeking anonymity. Later in the evening, the party announced that the meeting scheduled on Thursday, a day before the start of Budget session, would be postponed to Saturday.

301,['11/02/2020'],‘Heading finance dept a new experience’,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar says handling the finance department is a new experience for him. Busy holding various rounds of meetings with stakeholders ahead of the state budget, he tells Manvir Saini that the document would have something for everybody

For the first time, Haryana will have a CM present the budget. What prompted you to keep the finance department with you?

This is certainly a new and lifetime experience for me. I am able to understand the technicalities behind finance management. As I had to keep one important or major department, I chose to keep this. Last time, I had the home department etc.

We have seen an extraordinary exercise ahead of the presentation of the budget. What do you have in store for the state?

There are two categories of people in the state — haves and have nots... both require equal attention. I’ve travelled across the state to know the pulse of businessmen, traders, industrialists, farmers and common man. Now, we shall have a session for interaction with elected representatives -- MLAs and MPs -- to know their feedback and finalise the document. Yes, we shall have something for everybody, especially the youth.

In your last term as CM, BJP had come to power on its own. This time, you have a coalition government.

There’s not much of a difference. We all are a team. During the last term, we had our cabinet colleagues and we used to organise small official and unofficial meetings. It is the same now. I, deputy chief minister and other ministers speak to each other on regular basis. Our main focus is to ensure an early completion of public interest projects.

What kind of issues come up regarding manifestoes of two parties (BJP & JJP). How do you deal with it?

Both the parties released their manifestoes in public interest. BJP’s manifesto (regarding social benefits) would put a burden of Rs 30,000 crore on the exchequer, and JJP’s Rs 36,000 crore. As the difference of financial allocation is not much and most promises are common, we don’t face any problem. We are moving ahead with the common minimum programme.

How does the government plan to ensure that 75% unskilled jobs go to local youth?

This issue is right at the top of the common minimum programme with our coalition partner. Labour and industry cannot work without each other. We intend to bring in legislation to make it a reality. But, one thing is for sure, this system will not be forced upon industries or businessmen. They will have at least a three-year period to decide whether they want to go with it or not. We have this kind of provision in the town and country department. While applying for CLU, an entrepreneur has to ensure at least 75% jobs for locals. But, this has not become workable. It will be done now in a systematic manner.

As CM, what are your achievements in getting projects in the general budget this time?

One, we have managed to get the museum at Rakhirgarhi. Second, orbital rail corridor and state getting special attention in allocation for tourism. Orbital is a major project wherein cost will be shared by state and Union governments and private stakeholders. It will help in transportation ease in Haryana and NCR. Similarly, there’s Kurukshetra circuit for promoting tourism.

Despite your claims of achievement in 100 days (of governance), the opposition continues to target the coalition, especially while referring to law and order unemployment.

Our projects and development are for masses, not the opposition. We are the ones who increased social security pension schemes, started the concept of setting up examination centres within a 50km radius and so on. More than 100 small and big works have been done.

You count the number of criminals arrested and the cases solved. Look at the conviction rate. The opposition is looking for issues to disturb communal harmony by provocation. In other words, the opposition is jobless these days. It is not necessary that we reply their every question.

Be it the CID issue or paddy, the opposition has grabbed the opportunity to take on government.

There was no such controversy or issue. Anil Vij ji is a senior MLA and a very good friend of mine. Our party as well as the democratic system allows us to speak up. The issue was technical in nature. It now stands resolved and we continue to work as good friends and team. As for scam, let the Congress count the number of vigilance or CBI probes ordered during its tenure. Now they should count ours.

DCP Patil said, “It is yet to be ascertained how the woman set herself on fire and whether she had come with a bottle/container of petrol or kerosene with her. We are investigating the case further.”

The displays state that trucks are not allowed on the stretch between 8am and 11am as well as between 4pm and 8pm. If trucks were found using the stretch, police will impose a fine of Rs 20,000 under Section 115 and Section 194 of the Motor Vehicles Act. tnn

304,['11/02/2020'],Teachers hold Save Agra University yajna to protest alleged scam by VC,"This story is from February 11, 2020

AGRA: Instructors of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University on Monday organised a “Save Agra University” yajna to register their protest against vice-chancellor Arvind Kumar Dixit, for allegedly withdrawing Rs 1.5 crore from the account of teacher’s welfare fund (TWF), in violation of norms.

Under the banner of Agra University Teachers Association (AUTA), teachers of 39 government-aided colleges in Agra and seven nearby districts organised the yajna. Association leaders accused the VC of financial irregularities and demanded strict action against him, besides immediate transfer of the amount he had allegedly withdrawn back to the TWF account.

Protestors said the VC on January 3 transferred Rs 1.5 crore from the TWF account to the university's main account, in violation of norms. AUTA demanded that the state government should investigate the matter, and that the fund, mandated for use only on welfare of teachers, be deposited back in its account. They also demanded action be taken against the VC for financial malpractice.

AUTA general secretary Nishant Chauhan said, “Until the VC reimburses the TWF funds, he will not be invited to any programme organised by government-aided colleges. If he still visits for any other purpose, teachers will protest with black flags, he said. From Tuesday onwards, teachers will also boycott work between 11am- 2pm.”

Earlier on January 20, AUTA had handed over a memorandum to varsity administration, demanding return of the fund withdrawn from TWF within three days. However, the VC did not take any action.

BAU public relations officer, G S Sharma , said, “The claims and allegations of AUTA leaders are baseless and part of a tactic to put pressure on the university administration. TWF is generated from the fee provided to teachers for evaluation of answer sheets. We had Rs 2.5 crore in its account, of which, the contribution of teachers of government-aided colleges in Agra is around 9%. Presently, Rs 1 crore is available in the TWF account. The remaining Rs 1.5 crore has been utilised to build a guest house for teachers on Khandari campus. Standard procedure was followed in utilisation of the fund, and on construction work.”

MUMBAI: A district consumer forum has ordered Coffee Day Global to pay a compensation of Rs 13,000 to two Navi Mumbai residents after one of them found a cockroach in her cold coffee. The patrons had paid Rs 224 for the coffee and some eatables. The forum held that the company was negligent in maintaining basic hygiene standards and had to compensate the patrons for it.

Prachi Patil and Rameshchandra Kumawat submitted a complaint before the additional Mumbai suburban district consumer disputes redressal forum on January 16, 2018. They said they had visited the Café Coffee Day outlet at a Kurla mall, where after consuming the coffee, at the bottom of the glass, they found a cockroach. They further stated that after seeing the insect, they felt nauseous, giddy and had chills. The patrons said they immediately complained to the coffee shop and subsequently even sent an email to the customer care. They said since they got no favourable response, they lodged a complaint with the forum.

Patil and Kumawat also submitted pictures of the insect, a copy of the bill and the emailed complaint copy.

The company responded to the complaint and denied the allegations.

They said the complaint was filed with a mala fide intention to extort money from them. The company also submitted that the complainants were lawyers and they were misusing the law. It said the duo had themselves got the dead cockroach and planted in the coffee. The company further submitted it was not plausible that the patrons would come all the way from Navi Mumbai to have coffee at their outlet at Kurla.

It said that all these circumstances showed that the duo had submitted a false complaint.

The forum, though, refuted the company’s submissions. It said the company had not submitted any evidence to back its claims that the patrons had themselves brought the dead cockroach and planted it.

It also observed that the company had not brought anything on record to show how it maintained hygiene at its outlets.

The forum said the company had not brought any evidence to counter photographs given by the complainants.

309,['11/02/2020'],Push credit to MSMEs: RBI to banks,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Panaji: Concerned about the survival of Goa’s MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) sector, the Reserve Bank of India on Monday urged private and public sector banks to enhance lending to entrepreneurs in a proactive manner.

RBI General Manager for Goa N J Nampoothiri said that lack of basic understanding of the financial products, banking procedures and risk-return framework were some of the challenges that inhibit the progress of MSME units.

“This (MSME sector) is where the GDP will come from so this is something that needs to concern all of us. Unfortunately, the sensitisation or awareness that we try to do for bankers through financial literacy centres, much more needs to be done,” Nampoothiri said.

Candidly admitting that entrepreneurs often face problems while sourcing funds, Nampoothiri encouraged banks to appraise MSME projects in a different manner.

“We need to move away from collateral and look at proposals which are inherently good,” he said. His suggestion was supported by Nabard general manager Kamakshi Pai. “Bankers need to appraise the entrepreneur along with the project. Appraise the attitude of the entrepreneur,” she said.

Addressing bankers while launching the financial literacy week, Nampoothiri said that MSMEs play a significant role in economic development of the country. At the same time, knowledge of financial norms and compliances is missing.

“The sector contributes about 45% of the manufacturing output of the whole country. More than 40% of the exports comes from sector and nearly one third of the GDP is accounted for by MSMEs. It employs 11 crore people,” the RBI official said.

Nampoothiri, who took over as Goa officer-in-charge just a week earlier, said that all stakeholders need to work together. “Many MSMEs have not been brought into the formal fold which is why it makes banks reluctant to lend. Only if the credibility of the MSME is there, will the banker come forward. This is where the government should play a helping hand in trying to bring the MSMEs into the formal fold,” he said.

Coimbatore: The forest department on Monday deployed anti-poaching watchers and set up cameras in and around Chittepalayam village near the Sirumugai forest after a four-month-old calf was killed in a suspected leopard attack.

Forest officers said the calf, reared by N Murugan, 48, of Chittepalayam, was found dead with bite marks near his house on Monday morning.

“On Sunday night, Murugan had let his cattle graze on his farmland at the foothills of Thenkalkaradu, which is just 50m from the forest. As the calf did not return, he launched a search in the morning and its carcass was found near his field,” a forest officer said.

When alerted, Sirumugai forest range officer E N Manoharan and his team reached the spot. Villagers complained that a leopard had been roaming in the area and urged him to capture it immediately. They also threatened to stage a protest if the incident were to be repeated.

Following this, the forest department deployed anti-poaching watchers and fixed four cameras to monitor and capture the movement of wild animals in the area. “We installed camera traps to find out which animal killed the calf. If leopard is roaming in the area, we will immediately place traps to capture it,” Manoharan said. tnn

312,['11/02/2020'],SC issue notice in Agra defence property scam,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Supreme Court

AGRA: The Supreme Court has issued notice to the government of India, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and headquarters of Army’s Central Command seeking their response in the alleged defence property scam in Agra.

According to the petitioner and local RTI activist Bir Bahadur Singh , CBI even after four and a half years of delay has not been able to complete investigation in the case which involved a Rs 20 crore defence property illegally acquired by Agra cantonment board vice-president in 1996 in connivance with the defence estate officials.

The activist who is also an ex-serviceman has been pursuing the matter since 2011. On basis of response to RTI queries filled by the activist, in 2012, four members of Parliament, including the then minister of state for human resource development Ramshankar Katheria and incumbent Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari , had recommended a CBI probe into the defence property scam.

According to the defence estate records, 1.36 acres of defence land was given on lease to one Mitthan Lal for 30 years on March 2, 1936. After Lal’s death, the property was transferred to his wife Anara Devi. In 1966, the lease of the property was extended for another 30 years. On July 7, 1972, Anara Devi died. Mitthan Lal and Anara Devi had no son or daughter.

According to the petitioner, taking advantage of the situation, two women, Prakash Singh and Kalawati Devi , claiming to be relatives of Mitthan Lal and Anara Devi came forward to take hold of the property. Later, the high court found papers provided by the two women to be fake. The quarter was taken back by the defence estate department.

According to the petitioner, in 1984, one KS Bhatnagar, son on Kalawati Devi, got the property transferred in his name from defence estate. In the entire process, no approval was taken from the defence ministry.

According to the petitioner, incumbent Agra cantonment board vice-president Pankaj Mahendru in conveyance with the defence estate officials got the property transferred from Kalawati’s son to Mohammad Nasim and Raisuddin in 1996. Later, he on basis of fake documents got the property registered in his name, the petitioner alleged.

Petitioner Bir Bahadur Singh said, “It is surprising that CBI has not been able to come to any conclusion in the case. Now, after the court notice, they will have to submit the probe report. The ministry of defence should immediately attach the property. Besides, FIR should be registered against all those involved in the scam.”

When contacted, ACB vice-president Pankaj Mahendru said, “The allegations are completely baseless and politically motivated. I have all the valid documents related to the property. The property was transferred to me after approval from the ministry of defence. Later, the lease was also extended.”

Mahendru has been the vice-president of ACB since 1998. His father, OP Mahendru, held the same post for around 25 years till 1991.

Poinguinim: Peeved by the lack of basic amenities, nearly 200 residents of Nadkem and Keri in Cotigao have resolved to boycott the upcoming zilla panchayat polls.

Residents of these hamlets that are located in forested areas, have lamented that even after 59 years of Liberation, they have been deprived of a motorable road among other facilities.

Reshma Gaonkar, a local of Nadkem, lamented the lack of a primary school for children who walk long distances.

Former Cotigao sarpanch Rajesh Gaonkar said the people are forest dwellers, many of whom have submitted land claims under the Forest Rights Act.

Though some residents have obtained sanads, they have to endure a lot of hardship to carry out maintenance work of their homes, said sarpanch Umesh Gaonkar. “When they want to expand their homes, obtaining necessary approvals is cumbersome,” he said.

Meanwhile, the residents of Keri, Nadkem, Kuskem, Yedda and Bhutpal have submitted a petition to the government through Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes to exclude their areas from the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary.

Panaji: Keeping up the attack on health minister Vishwajit Rane, Congress on Monday challenged him to reveal the rate at which Goa Medical College and hospital, Bambolim, procures medicines and medical equipment from a private pharmacy.

Accepting Rane’s challenge to a public debate, state Congress president Girish Chodankar said it should be held in front of the Pharma Traders’ Association and the media. He said Rane’s veiled threats were an indication that the minister wanted to “cover his medicine purchase scam”.

“What kind of special rate contract for special discount was signed between the pharmacy and the government? What exorbitant cost is he (Rane) procuring the medicines to give them free to patients at GMC?” Chodankar asked.

Chodankar wants the health minister to specify if the private pharmacy in question offers discounts to patients who purchase medicines directly, if other government hospitals in India purchase medicines at maximum retail price (MRP), and why GMC does not have sufficient stocks of medicines.

“Are Vishwajit and Goa FDA aware that the pharmacy supplies medicines to GMC at MRP using a wholesale licence? Is this legal and allowed ?” Chodankar asked.

Nashik: A five-year-old girl was killed while two others suffered serious injuries after the two-wheeler they were travelling on was hit by a speeding pick-up vehicle on the Shinde-Naygaon road in the Nashik Road area on Sunday evening.

According to the police, the driver of the pick-up vehicle fled the scene after the accident. The deceased girl has been identified as Ashlesha Shamrao Pagare, a resident of Mohagaon in Jakhori.

The victim was travelling on the bike with her 40-year-old aunt and one more relative. At 6.30 pm, when the three were near the Uni Deritend company, their vehicle was hit by an unidentified pick-up vehicle coming from the opposite direction.

The girl’s father, who was working in his farm, got a call from his sister’s cellphone by an unidentified person informing him about the accident.

The caller also told Ashlesha’s father that the pick-up vehicle driver had fled the scene after the accident.

“By the time Ashlesha’s father reached the spot, the injured trio had been taken to a private hospital,” a police officer said.

“When the father reached the hospital, the doctors admitted the injured and referred the girl to NMC’s Bytco hospital. Later, Ashlesha was declared brought dead at the civic hospital. She had suffered injuries on her head and face,” a police officer said.

“We have registered an offence of causing death by negligence against the unidentified driver. So far, we have not received any clue about the motorist who caused the accident.

Nashik: Illegal hawkers have returned and reoccupied the M G Road-Shalimar stretch — from where they were removed just 10 days ago. As a result, traffic problems and congestion have also returned to the area.

On January 31, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and the city police had undertaken a special anti-encroachment drive in the area to clear the congestion on roads. Before that, senior police officials had also conducted a meeting with the hawkers to inform them about the anti-encroachment drive. The hawkers were given the choice of relocating to the area behind the Regional Referral Hospital. However, many of the hawkers had objected to the proposal. Nonetheless, the anti-encroachment department went ahead with its drive and cleared the MG Road-Shalimar area known as the Nepali Corner.

Over the past few days, one of two hawkers started returning to the stretch. However, on Monday, the entire stretch was again filled with hawkers. Many commuters said the situation is back to square one. They said they would again start facing traffic congestions.

Amit Kawale, a salesman at a shop in the MG Road area, said, “Riding a bike becomes difficult during the evening hours. The hawkers don’t just occupy one side of the road. They sit on both sides.”

Kawale added that the police and the NMC should continue the drives regularly.

Sajan Sonawane, senior PI of the Bhadrakali police station, said that the police are driving away the hawkers on a regular basis. However, soon after the police are gone, the hawkers return. He said that the vehicle of the NMC’s anti-encroachment department should be visiting the place on a regular basis as they seize the articles of the hawkers, which is a great deterrent. “We would communicate the problem to the NMC officials,” he said.

The encroachers also occupy space near the Shalimar bus stand leaving very little space for the movement of vehicles, especially city buses.

Shimla: The Himachal Pradesh government will import apple saplings this year from the US instead of Italy for distribution among farmers under Rs 1,134-crore World Bank-funded project. The decision came following complaints about the saplings imported from Italy, including 3.05 lakh drying up before their distribution to farmers.

However, under pressure from the state, the Italian nursery, which had supplied the saplings in wrong season, has now agreed to replace the same. In the first round, 75,000 plants will be replaced. Under the Rs 1,134-crore horticulture development project, the state government had imported 7,55,250 apple plants from Italy in 2015-16 and 2016-17 at a cost of Rs 400 per plant. Later, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur had decided to give relief to apple producers and provided 50% subsidy on these plants at the rate of Rs 200 per plant.

Horticulture minister Mahender Singh Thakur said that the apple plants imported from Italy in past had complaints, including 3.05 lakh plants going dry before their distribution among the farmers, as plants were sent from Italy in the months of April and May.

NEW DELHI: The population of vultures, which are carrion-eaters and considered quite useful for ecosystem services such as scavenging, has declined sharply in India from four crore to less than four lakh in three decades, environment minister Prakash Javadekar said on Monday.

""In India, vultures died after consuming dead cattle, which were given 'diclofenac' drug, and their population reduced from four crore to less than four lakh. We are taking efforts to revive the population,"" said Javadekar while addressing a press conference on the upcoming 13th Conference of Parties (COP13) of the UN Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).

'Diclofenac' is a veterinary drug used to treat cattle. It leads to death of vultures who feed on dead animals.

""Representatives from 130 countries, eminent conservationists and international NGOs working in the field of wildlife conservation will be attending COP13,"" said Javadekar, adding that the issue of decline in population of vultures would also be discussed.

Though wild life conservationists have long been demanding complete ban on 'diclofenac', it has not yet been banned across the country. The drug has only been banned in Tamil Nadu.

320,['11/02/2020'],Ramsar site may get more sluice gates,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Nashik: The district water resources department (WRD) is planning to install more sluice gates at the Nandur Madhmeshwar pickup weir in the Niphad taluka to tackle the issue of inundation of villages during floods.

The WRD is consulting the Central Water Power Research Station (CPWRS) to chalk out the number of sluice gates that can be installed at the weir, which was constructed by the British to ensure drinking water supply for the parched regions of Aurangabad and Ahmednagar districts in 1902.

“There are seven gates in bunches of four and three on each end of the weir, which take up more than half-a-kilometre width of the Godavari river. A few more gates will have to be installed to tackle the issue of inundation of villages during the floods,” said executive engineer of the Nashik irrigation division, Sagar Shinde.

The need to install more sluice gates was felt after Chandori and Saikheda villages were inundated due to heavy flooding last year, added Shinde.

In 2005-06, a few villages, including Chandori and Saikheda, had completely submerged due to the floods. The magnitude of the flood was such that water from Godavari river had submerged the road leading from Nashik to Aurangabad near Odha village and the road had to be kept shut till the flood water subsided. This was because the weir did not have sluice gates and sedimentation had eaten away a major portion of the weir.

“Because of the weir, the river always swelled and inundated the villages. The flood in 2005-06 was the worst. It was then that district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal decided to install gates for the weir, took up the matter with the government and had the gates installed in 2010,” said Shinde.

Once installed, the gates at the weir addressed the problem of inundation of the villages, but not completely.

“The additional gates will ensure quick discharge of water coming from the upstream areas. Just as the seven gates reduced the risk of inundation by more than 70%, chances are that the additional gates will fully combat the risk. This will definitely have huge an impact on the lives of the people and even on the economy of the region,” he said.

321,['11/02/2020'],Grievance meetings in corpn turn damp squib,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Trichy: In the absence of an elected council in Trichy Corporation, the weekly grievance meet on Mondays plays a crucial role for locals to get their grievances redressed. But, with the corporation undermining the significance of meet by not letting the petitioners meet the corporation commissioner and also his frequent unavailability, the number of petitioners coming there has declined over the past few months.

Every Monday, the chamber of the commissioner and special officer, S Sivasubramanian witnesses residents waiting to submit grievances. But, for the past few months, as the civic body chief is mostly unavailable, people were told to submit the complaints to second-level officers which yielded no solution.

Meanwhile, on Monday, petitioners from Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) approached the commissioner’s chamber to demand basic needs. But, officials told them that Sivasubramanian is away for an inspection and insisted them to submit the grievance to the city engineer. But, they decided to wait and meet the commissioner. “This is not the first time. We could not meet the commissioner twice earlier too. As we decided to wait, it took around three hours to meet him. Not all petitioners can afford to wait for long hours,” petitioner S R Kishore Kumar said.

Since petitioners are repeatedly told to submit the complaints to their respective assistant commissioners which are not materialising, residents said the purpose of grievance meets is diluted. “We tried to meet the commissioner twice last month for discussing the needs of street vendors. Till now, we could not meet him,” K Suresh, general secretary, Trichy district AITUC said.

The corporation has also cancelled the conduct of zonal-level grievance meet that was underway every Saturdays since July 2019. Efforts to seek a response from the corporation commissioner S Sivasubramanian went in vain.

When contacted, an official in the main office said, “If the district collector is absent, people submit grievances to the district revenue officer. Similarly, residents can submit their grievances to the city engineer.”

322,['11/02/2020'],Farmers stop digging of new ONGC oil well,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Trichy: A section of farmers of Alivalam village in Tiruvarur district on Monday opposed the digging of a new ONGC oil well on a piece of land owned by two farmers. Both had handed over their land to ONGC on lease for oil extraction two decades ago and two wells were completed. When ONGC workers were preparing to dig a third well on their land, both registered stiff opposition, alleging that operations had already depleted groundwater table.

ONGC authorities, who did not wish to be named, told TOI that as per the contract entered into with the farmers, they had begun work to dig a third well. Both the farmers had already received the monetary compensation as per the agreement. “So, they have no right to object,” they said. On Sunday, DMK’s principal secretary K N Nehru had dubbed the state government’s move to give a protection tag to delta districts as “double standards”.

Meanwhile, farmers’ leaders and activists have demanded that chief minister Edappadi Palaniswamy’s announcement to make the delta a protected zone be made the government’s policy decision. It should spell out that exploration or extraction process of hydrocarbon will not be allowed in the delta region anymore.

“There are some apprehensions about the manner in which the Union government and the oil companies will react to the CM’s announcement,” Anti-methane Project Movement coordinator T Jayaraman said. “There are several instances where the courts have nullified decisions taken by the governments. However, if the government would make it clear that it has decided to implement the plan as a policy decision, even judiciary cannot intervene in it”, he added. Moreover, the state government should adopt a resolution unanimously in the assembly and get it notified in the gazette by the Union government, he added.

323,['11/02/2020'],Pak kabaddi cup row: ‘Indian’ players being adjusted in other teams,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Amritsar: Participation of a group of circle kabaddi players, suspected to be mostly from Punjab, in Pakistan’s first kabaddi world cup 2020 has led to a new controversy as Pakistan Amateur Circle Kabaddi Federation (PACKF) has claimed many ‘Indian’ kabaddi players were being adjusted in the teams of other countries such as Australia, England and Canada.

The players, estimated to be 45 in number and accompanied by a group of some 12 officials and coaches, are in the neighbouring country without any official permission or clearance.

The Pakistan federation also demanded an investigation into why the unauthorized players from India were being treated as an official Indian team.

PACKF secretary general Muhammad Sarwar Bhatt told TOI on phone that Indian passport holders have been included in the teams of England, Canada and Australia as kabaddi players. He said only a few players from these countries had arrived in Pakistan and their teams had been completed by including kabaddi players from India.

Sierra Leone, Azerbaijan and Iran also have send their teams for the eight-day tournament. “Iran’s team is somewhat a serious contender but Sierra Leone and Azerbaijan are non-kabaddi playing nations and do not have much at stake. USA, Canada and Kenya did not send their teams to participate,” Bhatt said.

Highlighting the issue of invitation, a letter dated November 28, 2019 and written on the letterhead of Punjab Kabaddi Association surfaced on Monday, purportedly shows that the body had been informed by Pakistan about the kabaddi world cup. The authenticity of the letter, which carries reference number 1151, could not be confirmed but it includes signature of its secretary Amanpreet Singh Malhi.

In the letter, the association expressed gratitude towards Pakistan Kabaddi Association secretary general Muhammad Sarwar Rana for extending invitation for kabaddi world cup and confirmed participation of a team representing India.

Punjab Kabaddi Association Sikander Singh Maluka and Malhi were not available for any comment on Monday.

Justice S P Garg (Retd), administrator of the Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India (AKFI), the governing body of the sport in India, said it was up to the central government to take action against the unofficial kabaddi team. The AKFI, he added, would ask Punjab Kabaddi Association whether it had any role in sending the players to Pakistan and would take action accordingly.

BOX: Jakhar demands inquiry

Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar has demanded an inquiry into ‘Indian’ kabaddi players playing in Pakistan. Jakhar said the BJP at the Centre and Akalis in Punjab preach nationalism, but at the same time they allowed as many as 60 players to cross over without due permissions. “It is a matter of serious concern and it needs to be investigated if these players have gone there as couriers. They may not be Indian citizens and only Indian passport holders and one wonders if there is a Referendum 2020 angle to it. What is the ulterior motive?” he asked.

“Obviously, they are not there to migrate to Pakistan. The episode reminds one of the ‘kabootarbazi’ incidents in the state. The intent behind sending the players needs to be probed and I would request the union home minister to put NSA on the job,” said Jakhar, adding, “I want to ask (SAD president) Sukhbir Singh Badal, whose close aide were involved in sending the team to issue a clarification,” he said. “Since they did not have the necessary permissions, it is being speculated that someone powerful might have recommended their names and Union ministers from Punjab are from BJP and Akali Dal,” he said.

324,['11/02/2020'],"Fomento gets mine in Odisha, ops to begin next year","This story is from February 11, 2020

Panaji: With no signs of mining activities resuming soon in Goa, mining firm Fomento had decided to expand its footprint outside the state. The Centre has allotted iron ore mine in an area of 7,50,00 sqm to Fomento in Odisha with a production limit of 5 million tonnes per annum.

Before mining came to a halt in Goa in September 2012, the production at Fomento mines was around 15 million tonnes per annum. The Odisha mine is set to be the biggest in the company’s portfolio. Mining activities in Odisha are likely to commence next year, director Partho Banerjee told TOI.

“This mine will be an additional asset for the company and it is our first footprint in Odisha,” he said. Ore extracted at Odisha would mostly be used for domestic consumption, he said.

He said that if there is domestic requirement, and given the high export duty on high-grade iron, it would be better that the ore is sold for domestic consumption. Iron ore in Odisha is of the 62-64 grade.

Banerjee said that the mine allotted in Odisha was being operated by Bonai Industrial Company Ltd (BICO). The lease was to expire in March 2020 and the Union government decided to e-auction all mines expiring in 2020.

The director said that the total reserve at mining leases is estimated at around 35 million tonnes, and the environmental clearance was for the extraction of 5 million tonnes per annum. “If we are able to extract at least 80% of the EC limit, the company would extract around 4 million tonne per annum,” he said.

. “It will take six to eight months to complete the paperwork. We will be able to start operating the mine from next year,” he said.

Presently, Fomento operates iron ore and bauxite mines in Maharashtra and Karnataka. The director said that the total extraction limit of iron ore mine in Maharashtra is 4 lakh tonne per annum and for bauxite, around 3 lakh tonnes per annum. In Karnataka, the total production limit of three iron ore mines touches 3.5 million tonne per annum.

He also said that Fomento is developing mines in Brazil and Australia.

Nashik: The Ambad police have arrested a director of a group of finance companies, who has multiple cases registered against him in different parts of the state, for cheating an investor. He has been remanded in police custody till February 13.

A person approached the Ambad police recently alleging that the director, Vishnu Ramchandra Bhagwat, had cheated him of Rs 2.10 lakh. The complainant has told the police that he had not only invested money in one of the schemes floated by Bhagwat, but had also worked as an agent for the same group of companies. He alleged that the director also did not pay him his commission.

The Ambad police have registered a case of criminal breach of trust under section 406 of the Indian Penal Code, criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent (section 409) and cheating (section 420). Sections of the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act, 1978 have also been invoked.

The police said the suspect started one scheme in October 2018 and by January 2019, he collected crores of rupees from thousands of investors. The Mumbai Naka police station in Nashik had registered a case against Bhagwat in May last year, in which he had secured anticipatory bail.

The case at Mumbai Naka police station against the director has been registered under the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act, 1978. So far, eight agents appointed by the suspect to collect deposits have been arrested by the Mumbai Naka police station.

The police said the suspect has cases with the Alephata police in Pune, Jaikheda police in Nashik rural, Bhandup police station in Mumbai and even in Himachal Pradesh.

The police have advised investors to conduct all checks of the companies and business houses before investing in any scheme.

326,['11/02/2020'],"Cops come across another illegal adoption for Rs 7,000","This story is from February 11, 2020

Trichy: The anti-child trafficking unit (ACTU) attached to rural police came across another case of baby sale at Badharkottai in Trichy recently. A couple from Vaalaiyur had a fourth child on January 13, a one-month-old baby boy. The couple already had two sons and one daughter. Bogged down by poor economic conditions, they gave the baby to their relative, a childless couple, at Badharkudi on February 1, in a case of illegal adoption.

While the ‘illegal adoptive parents’ were happy with the entry of a newborn into their life, ACTU got a tip recently about the illegal sale of the baby. A team led by inspector of police P Azeem of ACTU probed the matter and found that a woman engineer was involved in the case. Police said the engineer had already approached the baby’s parents before birth and struck a deal to sell their fourth baby. The buyer couple also allegedly accepted the deal.

However, when the baby was born, they changed their mind and gave the baby to a relative couple who have been childless for eight years after marriage. It was alleged that they sold the baby for Rs 7,000. In the wake of the change of mind, an anonymous caller tipped the police about the illegal adoption, following which the police recovered the baby from the couple in Badharkudi and produced it before the child welfare committee (CWC) on Saturday.

CWC sources said that the woman engineer with the connivance of a woman staff nurse of a primary health centre (PHC) in Trichy doctored the birth record of the baby boy by changing the name of the parents who were initially promised the child by the woman engineer. On Monday, ACTU filed a case in this connection and process of including the accused is under way. Meanwhile, CWC gave the child’s custody to a specialized adoption agency in Ariyalur on Monday. The police were on the lookout for the woman engineer and staff nurse.

327,['11/02/2020'],Twist in proposal to set up govt medical college,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Nashik: The state government is contemplating on starting the postgraduate and undergraduate medical courses at the same facility in Nashik to reduce expenses.

District collector Suraj Mandhare said a video conference was held on Monday with chief secretary Ajoy Mehta to follow up on issues discussed with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray during his recent visit here.

It may be recalled that the earlier BJP government had announced setting up of the first undergraduate and postgraduate medical college in Nashik district. Unlike other big cities in Maharashtra like Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur, Nashik does not have a government medical college.

The state government’s plan was to run the medical college at the civil hospital for three years, by which time it would have set up a new campus that would house the medical college and a 700-bed hospital in Nashik district on about 25 acres. The district administration was to identify the land.

“The government is now contemplating to club both the medical colleges,” the collector said. The Nashik civil hospital has 600 beds, six operation theatres and other facilities like blood bank. The hospital treats about 1,200 patients on an outpatient basis daily. The norm of the Medical Council of India is to have at least 300 beds at a hospital to start a medical college with intake capacity of 100 students.

The officers further added the government has sought a report about the Vinchur Wine Park, where only four establishments were working and 19 of the 22 plots were sold out over the past decade. The Maharashtra Industries Development Corporation has been asked to present a report about the park. The government would then decide about raising of the food park in the region.

The chief secretary also took up the issue of ‘Metro Neo’ project – the proposal of which is pending with the Union government. The chief secretary has asked the Maha Metro authorities to present a report of executing the project.

The BJP government had planned for the ‘Metro Neo’ project for Nashik city and Thackeray requested the European Investment Bank (EIB) to fund the project. Both the state and the Union governments are to contribute Rs 307 crore for the Rs 2,100-crore project.

The board recently held a meeting for the public exam conductors and observers in view of the Class XII board exam which is scheduled from February 26.

The board also informed the conductors and observers that now invigilators will have to upload the exam attendance online every day after the examination.

Before entering examination hall, students will be checked for any gadgets including bluetooth and smart watches, which are banned from the exam hall.

A notice warning against malpractice should be displayed prominently at the main entrance and at the entry of each block of the examination hall, the board said. The exam conductors were also informed to not permit any additional time to any candidate for answering the paper on grounds of illness, accident or any personal reason, except when such loss of time is caused to any candidate by an act of omission on part of the board or its agent.

The board has also directed conductors to ensure the cleanliness of toilets at all examination centres.

The house at Hindustan Park where the theft had taken place; (right) the booty recovered from Murshidabad

KOLKATA: A 55-year-old woman, who has been working as a domestic help-cum-caregiver in a business family for six years, has been arrested for stealing diamond and gold ornaments worth several lakhs from the residence.

The accused, Anjali Das (55) — who acted in connivance with her entire family — has been arrested along with her husband Imran Sk (57) and son Laltu Sk (38). The family of the complainant, Shivangi Agarwal (33), owns an iron-and-steel business.

The incident was reported from Hindustan Park on February 6. A joint team from Gariahat police and the burglary section of the detective department nabbed all the three accused within three days of receiving the complaint and recovered the booty. The theft, once again, has put to test the question of trust on helps, who spend several years with the employers but suddenly fall to momentary greed. The cops though said they were investigating if she had been habitually stealing from the household.

Agarwal on February 6 reported that gold and diamond ornaments and cash more than Rs 1 lakh, which were kept in her second-floor room, were missing. “There were five domestic helps. With all the security guards and drivers employed there, we had more than a dozen suspects. Since no almirah was broken, we knew it had to be an insider job,” said an investigator.

Das was asked to look after the elderly member of the family since she had won their trust. She also cooked food and was in charge of the kitchen for the joint family comprising of two brothers, their mother, their wives and children.

“When we probed Das’ whereabouts — where she had travelled lately, the calls made and her actions just before the theft — we found her son had returned to their Lalgola residence barely a few days before the theft,” said an investigator. But a confident Das continued working in the household and faced police questioning, trying to put the blame on the newly inducted employees.

A four-member team went to Murshibad even as cops asked Das to join a second round of questioning. “They broke down subsequently. We arrested the accused from Pirtala near Upar Fatepur at Lalgola in Murshidabad and all the stolen diamond-studded ornaments was recovered. We found the items concealed buried in the courtyard of their home,” said DC (southeast) Debasmita Das .

“We do not want to speak about the incident,” said a family member. Cops though said that even after five years, her employers had not verified the maid’s background local police.

Panaji: Work on sewerage treatment plants (STP) at Ponda, Colva and Sakhali is in advanced stages and they can be expected to be commissioned this year, Sewerage and Infrastructural Development Corporation of Goa Ltd (SIDCGL) managing director PB Seldarkar said.

The Sakhali plant, which has the capacity to treat 0.8MLD of waste, is receiving final touches and will be the first to be commissioned. “To start with, 150 houses will be connected to the plant,” Seldarkar said.

The larger and much-awaited 15MLD Ponda STP is expected to be ready by May or June this year, officials said. Nearly 4,500 houses will be connected to this plant.

“The structure is almost ready and only electrical and mechanical work is left. This plant will cover Ponda municipal area and Kavlem area. Over 90% of the network has already been laid. Presently, work on a main 400m link is on, where we had to use micro-tunneling method. We have hit hard basaltic rock and are finding ways to break it,” Seldarkar said. This 400m stretch is from the mamlatdar’s office up to the Dhavali bypass, he said.

Once these remaining works are completed, the STP can be expected to become functional by mid-2020, he said.

The Colva STP is 95% complete and over 70% of the sewerage line is already laid out, Seldarkar said.

“A PIL was filed in the high court of Bombay at Goa and the court has directed that the plant must be completed within a year’s time. Accordingly, we have to meet the October 2020 deadline. We had a meeting with panchayat officials and are confident of making the plant functional by the given deadline,” Seldarkar said.

Panaji, Vasco and Margao municipal areas are the only ones in the state where around 80% of the households are connected to STPs.

Seldarkar said that in the case of the Porvorim and Curti plants, while over 90% of the sewerage treatment lines have been laid, the process of finalising land for the plant is still on.

Trichy: Acting on a directive from the child welfare committee (CWC), the anti-child trafficking unit (ACTU) attached to Trichy rural police registered a case on Monday in connection with the illegal adoption of a three-month-old baby boy by a couple in Thiruverumbur recently. The unit is in the process of implicating those involved including a woman broker and the biological mother of the baby born from an illegitimate relationship.

The illegal adoption was exposed after neighbours of the couple, Ashwini and Govindhan, grew suspicious over a newborn baby in their house for the past three months. Acting on the tip, ACTU inspector P Azeem enquired with the couple and found that the baby was sold to them for Rs 1 lakh by its 42-year-old mother through a woman broker on November 2. Further interrogation brought to light that the couple had seven-year-old and four-year-old daughters. They had tried for legal adoption of a baby boy. Sensing their longing, a woman named Velammal approached the couple with an offer to get them a baby boy for Rs 1 lakh through illegal means.

In their statement to district child protection unit (DCPU) officials, Ashwini said they decided to take the offer from the woman as legal adoption will have lengthy processes lasting two or more years. Accepting the deal, the couple also gave her the money and took over the baby. CWC officials summoned the couple Ashwini and Govindhan following the information received from their neighbours. They appeared before CWC with the baby on Saturday. The committee ordered temporary stay of the baby with the buyer mother at a home in Mannarpuram on Sunday. On Monday, CWC gave temporary custody order of the child to a specialized adoption agency in Ariyalur district following which the baby was being taken to the home in the evening.

The biological mother and broker Velammal evaded the inquiry by CWC and ACTU. Superintendent of police Zia Ul Haq said that a case has been registered while inspector Azeem said that further inquiry will be conducted with the biological mother and the broker woman.

Trichy: Trichy farmers have alleged that those in their neighbouring districts are misusing Mettur reservoir water meant for them by taking it away to irrigate their farmlands during summer. Farmers have urged the district collector to take necessary action to stop the practice.

Farmers said banana and black gram crops cultivated on hundreds of acres are in the hope that they will get water for irrigation from the river. However, farmers in Namakkal, Karur and Erode districts are stealing the water using pumps for irrigation.

They urged the district collector to take steps to disconnect the power supply of hundreds of motors used to pump water from river Cauvery. As the Mettur reservoir has been downed its shutters on January 28, only a small quantum of water – 1000 cusecs to 2000 cusecs – is released from Mettur reservoir for drinking purpose.

Farmers from Trichy district are usually using the water in Cauvery to irrigate their banana and black gram cultivation, said Puliyur A Nagarajan, state organizer of farmers’ wing of Tamil Manila Congress.

“However, farmers from the upstream districts pump huge quantum of water from the river using giant motors from Cauvery to raise cash crops like sugarcane, turmeric, leaving Trichy farmers in a lurch”, he alleged.

Dehradun: The body of a 30-year-old man from Noida, who was missing since January 26, was found near a local temple in ski town of Auli in Chamoli district on Monday.

The man, identified as Mayank Gupta, is a resident of sector 77, Noida. He had left his home after an alleged altercation with his family on January 21, police said. Police have also recovered a suicide note from his pocket stating that no one should be blamed for his act as he had “come here to attain peace.”

Jaipal Singh, in-charge of Joshimath police station, said, “Gupta left home on his bike, reached Joshimath on January 22 and checked into a hotel here. On January 26, he left for Auli in a ropeway and had been missing since then. He last spoke to his friend in Delhi on the same day.”

Police added that his family had filed a missing complaint in Noida and had approached Uttarakhand police on February 7 after Mayank remained inaccessible for over 10 days. “He was unemployed and the family told police that he was also under depression,” said inspector Singh.

Chamoli SP Yashwant Singh said, “The family contacted us and said that their son had been missing since January 26. I took his mobile number from them and gave it to our district surveillance team. His phone was switched off for the past many days.”

During investigation, police found that Mayank Gupta stayed in a hotel in Joshimath for three-four days before heading for Auli on January 26. “After reaching Auli, he informed the hotel in Joshimath that he would stay in Auli for a few days,” the SP said.

Author Meena Vaishampayan delivering a lecture ‘Durga Bhagwat: Vyaktitva ani sanshodhan parv’ at Vidarbha Sahi... Read More

NAGPUR: Durga Bhagwat was devoted to literature until her last breath. A prolific author, she wrote across genres. She raised her voice while doing research work as she was a staunch proponent of freedom of expression, said author Meena Vaishampayan from Asiatic Society of Mumbai .

Vaishampayan was delivering a lecture ‘Durga Bhagwat: Vyaktitva ani sanshodhan parv’ organized on Saturday at Vidarbha Sahitya Sangh (VSS), Sitabuldi, to mark Bhagwat’s birth anniversary.

Senior writers Asha Bagge, Vamanrao Telang, Ravindra Shobhane , Ulhas Vaisayan, Shubhada Fadnavis and others were present.

Addressing Bhagwat fondly as ‘Bai’, Vaishampayan said, “With extreme perseverance, she translated 547 Jatak Tales and paved the way for Buddhist literature’s entry into mainstream. In a way, Bai laid the foundation stone for building Buddhist literature into one framework from the disorderly fashion it was in earlier.”

Throwing more light on Bhagwat’s contribution, Vaishampayan said Bai was a scholarly figure who has written about diverse themes dealing with society, tribal education, nature and humanity in depth. “Besides being a writer and thinker, she will be remembered in the annals of Marathi literature for her knowledge and curiosity that formed the core of research as she travelled alone across the country to prepare a thesis on tribals.

“She also studied the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana to a great depth. Bai decided to study Early Buddhist Jurisprudence and undertook the path of research,” said Vaishampayan.

Vaishampayan also spoke on Bhagwat’s stand taken during Emergency. “Bai’s firebrand opposition to Emergency and attempts to curb free expression inspired dissent all over Maharashtra. She was arrested and sent to Arthur Road Jail where she continued her work of translating texts,” said Vaishampayan.

Bhagwat also found out that Hindu culture is one without divisions, added Vaishampayan and pointed out that she is popular even today for her contribution to folk literature. “Bai's writing style of unfolding life truths was laid out in simple language by her for everyone to understand,” said Vaishampayan.

At the outset, Fadnavis informed the audience about various activities carried out by Granthsahwas of VSS. Madhuri Wadibhasme conducted the programme.

337,['11/02/2020'],"Now, BJP asks if rights under Art 30 are not discriminatory","This story is from February 11, 2020

Panaji: State BJP spokesperson Narendra Sawaikar continued hitting out at the archbishop of Goa and Daman, Filipe Neri Ferrao, for the second day in a row on Monday, when he said that if the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was discriminatory, Article 30 of the Constitution was even more so. He said if that was the case, religious minorities should stop claiming benefits at the cost of taxpayers.

Article 30 promises all linguistic and religious minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. It also restricts the state from discriminating while providing help to any educational institution on the ground that it is managed by a linguistic or religious minority.

“If #CAA is discriminatory for Goa #Archbishop, then Article 30 of Constitution of India is more discriminatory. Don’t claim benefits at taxpayers’ money by claiming minority status! #CAA,” Sawaikar tweeted.

Ferrao on Saturday had appealed to the Centre to “immediately and unconditionally” revoke the CAA.

Stating that the archbishop should not “misguide and misinform”, Sawaikar, in another tweet on Monday, said, “#Archbishop’s statement is based on ifs and buts. Without any logic, reasoning & rationale. In fact #CAA is not #divisive but the #statement is.” He was also referring to Ferrao’s opposition to the NRC and NPR.

“Let Archbishop be informed that #CAA is a law and that any law can be repealed or rescinded. 1. by act of legislature OR 2. the Court striking it down. In present case challenge is already before the SC,” Sawaikar tweeted.

Power minister Nilesh Cabral said he did not think the CAA was wrong and that if the Church thought so, he was ready to discuss it. “Church, temple, mosque, all this is a different issue. We are Indians first. It is a democratic country. Anyone can say anything. But I have to use my knowledge and think. As per my knowledge, what has been done is not wrong. If it is wrong, I have to be convinced that what I think is wrong. If anyone calls me, I am ready to sit across the table and talk. If you convince me this is wrong, I will also back the statement,” he said.

Health minister Vishwajit Rane said the archbishop had the right to express his view while the government had the right to make the laws it thought necessary. “The archbishop holds such a high position in the state. He has the right to express his views. Our party has the right to do what it has to do. Ultimately we have to respect each other’s view. It is a democratic society,” he said.

Nashik: A high-tech water purifier, to be installed for free at the Nashik Road railway station, is ready with a city-based NGO, but the railway authorities are yet to identify the spot for it.

Anjuman-e-Hakimi Dawoodi Bohra Jamaat had proposed to install the ultra-violet (UV) water purifier that treats micro-biologically unsafe water with germicidal UV light and the railway divisional headquarters at Bhusawal gave the go-ahead for it late last year.

Asked why the delay in finding a spot for the purifier, a railway official said a survey is under way to identify the right spot for the water purifier. “We have to place the device at a location where water from the overhead tank will be purified and linked to the taps at proper pressure. We are working on the different spots where the device can be installed.”

Mufaddil Parvez, a functionary of the NGO, said passengers face problems due to a lack of drinking water at the station because of the water dispenser over there is non-functional.

“We want to provide clean drinking water to passengers at the station for free. The water filtration plant will have a capacity to filter 500 litres of water per hour. It will be fully automatic and function 24x7. It will be connected to several taps at the station.”

According to him, a cooler in the filtration plant would be made functional during summer, so that passengers can get cold water.

The organisation’s initiative will be a boon for thousands of passengers as the only water ATM at the station has been lying defunct for several months. The machine used to dispense clean water to passengers at a low cost, thereby reducing the need to buy bottled water.

“The responsibility for maintaining the device, like changing the filter every three months, will be borne by the trust,” said Parvez.

KOLKATA: Come May, the streets, lanes and by-lanes of Kolkata will wear a cleaner look, thanks to a garbage collection-&-disposal modernization plan adopted by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation solid waste management department. Under the project, the civic body will press into service 500 battery-operated vehicles in three months that will do rounds in the city to collect garbage.This will replace the rickety handcarts that are now being used for collection of waste from households. By the end of this year, such handcarts will be phased out as the civic body rolls out similar machines, a senior official in the KMC solid waste management department said.The official said that the KMC has bought over 200 such battery-powered machines in past three years in phases and put them to use in different wards. “However, this time when we get delivery of a fleet of 500 such machines, the city’s garbage collection and disposal system will see a major change,” he said.According to Debabrata Majumdar , the member, mayor-in-council overseeing the KMC solid waste management department, 500 battery-operated vehicles will be brought into Kolkata from Maharashtra by May and pressed into service.Majumdar said, “We shall improve the garbage collection by pressing into service the battery-operated vehicles that will be able to collect ten times more garbage compared to the handcarts. Moreover, unlike handcarts, the new vehicles will not cause spillover of garbage on the streets,” Majumdar said.Another official said the new vehicles will be commissioned in areas where the civic body has set up garbage compactors. These are stationed in localities for the whole day, taking in garbage and squeezing it for easy transportation. Besides this, the new machines will have facilities for taking segregated waste that will make it very useful in areas where the civic body has introduced garbage segregation at source.“We shall take help of the new fleet of vehicles to collect segregated wastes from households,” said a KMC solid waste management department official. Currently, the civic body has made waste segregation at source mandatory in 20 wards.A section of the KMC conservancy staffers who collect garbage from households using handcarts was happy with the decision. They said the new fleet will not only reduce their burden, but also reduce health hazards. “I am glad that now I will drive a car and collect garbage instead of pushing a heavy hand cart full of waste that made us prone to diseases,” said Manab Biswas a KMC conservancy staffer.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74073322,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-202613,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/e-cart-fleet-to-take-full-control-of-citys-garbage-collection-by-end-of-2020/articleshow/74070874.cms

Amit Ray (left) and Subrata Chakraborty

KOLKATA: When Bong Joon Ho became the first Korean director to win the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival for his film ‘ Parasite ’, little did Asian cinema fans realize that it was just the beginning of rewriting records. The 92 years of Academy history were rewritten when ‘Parasite’ became the first non-English language film to win the Oscar for best picture. Back in India, it gave reasons for two Bengali production designers, who were invited by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences to be its member in 2019, to feel a tad happier than others who rooted for Joon Ho. The Bengali duo had voted in the technical category of this year’s Academy awards and are happy to be a part of history.

At this year’s Golden Globes , Joon Ho had made headlines, saying, “Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films”. His big Oscar win, both 43-year-old Subrata Chakraborty and 44-year-old Amit Ray insist, is only going to help other Asian films get more global recognition. Chakraborty and Ray have done the production design of 36 Bollywood films, including ‘Rangoon’, ‘Project 24’, ‘Udta Punjab’, ‘Padmaavat’ and ‘Bajirao Mastani’, and are now busy with ‘Prithviraj’ and ‘Gangubai Kathiawadi’.

The duo was asked to vote for this year’s Oscars between January 30 and February 4. Chakraborty, who hails from Jhargram, said he was pleasantly surprised on being invited to be a member of the Academy in 2018. “I was told that Indian films have become very strong in terms of production design. Though I voted only in the technical category, I am sure the decision to include members like us has also contributed towards giving a non-English film such recognition,” said Chakraborty, who studied at Rabindra Bharati.

Ray is equally happy with the four wins of ‘Parasite’. “This is a big achievement. Earlier, English movies had complete monopoly at the Oscars. Though the monopoly hasn’t gone, one can feel the winds of changes. We have jury members from other parts of the world. Joon Ho’s Oscar win has opened new avenues for films from this subcontinent,” added Ray, who hails from New Barrackpore and is an alumnus of The Indian College of Arts and Draftsmanship.

In 2017, directors Buddhadeb Dasgupta and Goutam Ghose were in the list of Indian personalities to have been extended such invitation to be a part of the Academy committee. Though neither Ghose nor Dasgupta voted this year, both are happy with the Oscar story of ‘Parasite’. “It feels good to know that a Korean film has won at Cannes and the Oscars,” Dasgupta said. Ghose had once sent a note to the Academy as the jury chairman of the Indian entry for the Oscars. “For all the non-English speaking films, the Academy had instituted only one award. In my note, I had said that there should be more entries. Parasite is a fascinating film with many layers. I do not define it as just a thriller. The structure of the script is so interesting. It is a great gesture of the Academy to consider a non-English language film for the top award,” Ghose said.

Incidentally, “Parasite” also had a nomination in the technical category of the Oscars this year. However, the award went to Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon A Time… in Hollywood where the production design was done by Barbara Ling and Set Decoration by Nancy Haigh. On being asked why “Parasite” lost out in this category, Chakraborty described the production design of Tarantino’s film as “rich”. According to Chakraborty, who along with Ray personally voted for this category, “Apart from excellent set design, I really liked the choice of colour palette. Instead of opting for a contrast colour, this film uses a dilute palette. That’s why it was chosen as the Best Picture. Technically, Parasite is also very strong. It is just that one has to come and another second.”

341,['11/02/2020'],U’khand to witness rapid rise in mercury in next few days,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Dehradun: The maximum temperatures in Uttarakhand are likely to rise sharply in the next few days as dry weather is going to prevail over the Himalayan state, the regional meteorological centre said on Monday.

According to the Met office, the maximum temperatures will rise rapidly in the state reaching up to 6 to 8 degrees Celsius above normal, while the minimum temperatures are expected to hover around normal levels.

Bikram Singh, director of regional meteorological centre, said, “Dry weather will prevail in Uttarakhand for at least 8-10 days. As a result, temperatures will sharply rise, especially the maximum temperatures, in both hills and plains. The temperature will remain significantly higher from February 11 to 14.”

The plains and foothills, including Dehradun and Haldwani, might witness maximum temperature touching 28 degrees Celsius during the current week, Met officials said.

Due to the expected rise in days temperatures, the diurnal variation in the day and night temperature is likely to go above 22 degrees Celsius in plains and 15-18 degrees Celsius in the hills.

The Met office has also issued an advisory on the likely weather conditions in Uttarakhand. “Due to the prevalence of dry weather conditions and increase in diurnal temperature variability in plains, especially from February 11 to 14, conditions are becoming conducive for spread of flu and cold,” Singh said.

The increase in maximum temperature in the hills is also likely to trigger snow melting and thereby making conditions favourable for avalanche at isolated places in higher reaches of Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Pithoragarh and Bageshwar districts.

Trichy: A PhD research scholar from National Institute of Technology (NIT), Trichy, who developed the mechanism to prevent combat aircraft radar from getting detected by enemy radar, received much attention at the Defence expo 2020 - a gathering of defence equipment manufacturing companies in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.

V Krushna Kanth, along with his research guide, S Raghavan, former professor, NIT-Trichy, participated in the event while exhibiting his work on ‘Frequency RADOME technology’ at Defexpo 2020, organized by the department of defence production, Ministry of defence that concluded on Sunday.

Kanth’s project was awarded commendation last year and a cash prize of Rs 5 lakh from defence minister Rajnath Singh in the 41st DRDO directors’ conference in New Delhi on ‘Technology Leadership for Empowering India’.

His invention on frequency selective Radome, for which he is also awaiting patent, will help hide radar in combat aircrafts from getting detected by enemy radars. The front nose cone point of the aircraft accommodates radar for scanning and identification of target for bombing. This needs to be protected from enemy radar from identification.

“The Radome is designed in such a way that it will allow only certain electro-magnetic frequency from radar. That basically means, we should see others, but enemies should not see us. Our Radome works in specific frequency, which will be known only to us,” said Kanth.

“It was a great opportunity for us to exhibit our work to the national and international delegates and our product was seen by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself,” he said.

We received very good response from the defence chiefs from India and abroad. The proposed frequency selective Radome technology is the game changer of modern stealth technology for aircrafts, which helps in protecting the aircraft radar systems from enemy radars, Kanth added.

The scientist and former associate director at Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE), Bengaluru, D C Pande said in DRDO not much research was carried in this area. There have been papers published in this area, but no product was developed so far.

“Such technology is not shared by other countries, even those from whom we purchase aircrafts, so it was pivotal for us to develop our own technology,” said Pande, who is also a Dr Rajaramanna DRDO distinguished fellow.

Nashik: The city will host a drama competition for children with disabilities at the Kalidas Kala Mandir from February 13 to 15.

The event, organised by the state culture department, is being held for the second time in the state.

Writer-director Dhananjay Wable said “There is no stage fright among these children. The state government has given us an opportunity to portray the social challenges on the stage.”

Although the children cannot hear or speak, they understand expressions very well and express themselves effectively, he added.

A total of 12 plays of about 40 minutes will be performed in the three days. Day 1 will see five plays, following six plays on day 2 and one play on the final day.

Of the 12 plays, four are from Nashik, two each from Mumbai and Igatpuri, and one each from Latur, Solapur, Nagpur and Amravati.

Child actors in the play ‘Home Arrest’ belong to the 8-15 years age group and are from a school in the Cidco area for hearing-and-speech impaired children.

Pallavi Patvardhan, the writer and director of the play, said “We are performing a mime act with 12 children. These children enjoyed a lot while rehearsing for the act.”

As many as 13 children with learning disabilities, who are aged between 10 and 16 years, have been practising for three months. They will present a play to show how the environment is being harmed due to changes brought in the modern days.

“The children will showcase the ill effects of technology and other changes that have caused a decrease in the number of birds,” said Manisha Nalge, writer of the play ‘Kav Kav’.

E-W Metro will be thrown open to public on Valentine's Day

KOLKATA: Salt Lake residents, who have been looking forward to a rapid transit service all their lives, are happy that East-West Metro will finally start rolling but they are not sure if they can use it for daily use. It will be more like a joyride as of now and be helpful when the full stretch becomes operational, they feel.

“I can’t think of taking a Metro ride for some work along the short route between Sector V and Salt Lake. But I will certainly take rides on and off just for the feel of the Metro in my neighbourhood,” P N Saha, a retired IPS officer and resident of AJ Block, said on Tuesday. “Bus services in Salt Lake are erratic and auto drivers are rude. Salt Lake has always been a subject of ridicule when it comes to connectivity because rickshaws are the safest bet. We will be able to make most of Metro services when the full stretch becomes operational,” Saha added.

Senior bureaucrat and Hidco chairman Debashis Sen sounded optimistic. “It’s a great beginning,” the CF Block resident for 40 years said. “The East-West Metro’s purpose will be met when it runs till Howrah Maidan. It will be a fine value addition to Salt Lake’s infrastructure. Metro, after all, is the most environment-friendly way to commute.” Sen is eager for the Metro project to get over. “When fully operational, the new Metro will connect Sealdah and Howrah stations. This means, I can travel straight to Howrah station through river Hooghly and board a long-distance train and go on a holiday. That’s a very comforting thought,” he laughed.

CF Block resident Sonali Mundhra , who was born in Salt Lake, said, “The new Metro will only be a symbolic service for now. It’ll boost Salt Lake’s connectivity and be of enormous use when the project is completed. When Phoolbagan is added, it will certainly curtail people’s dependence on autos.”

Will the Metro ever emerge as the backbone of Salt Lake’s transportation, wondered Mehul Agarwal , a second-year student of St Xavier’s College. “The ground reality is that people will continue to wait for hours at key bus stops like Karumamoyee, PNB crossing, College More or City Centre like they do now. I don’t think Metro will emerge as an alternative to these missing buses,” Agarwal said.

Photo for representative purpose only

KOLKATA: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday asked the state government to file an affidavit on the action it had taken and what it proposed to do on encroachment in the East Kolkata Wetlands ( EKW ) while expressing concern over the absence of any measure to demarcate the boundary.

NGT has also asked Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and Bidhannagar Commissionerate to expedite the proper management of their respective municipal solid waste dumpsites in the EKW area.

Though the actual number of encroachments in EKW number in thousands, of the 357 FIRs that have been registered in EKW, action had been taken in only five cases, said Subhas Datta, the green activist who had moved NGT on the grave condition of the internationally recognised Ramsar site. A state environment official present at the hearing said it had been unable to act in several instances as the cases were pending in Calcutta high court.

On legacy sites like Dhapa, where KMC has been dumping Kolkata’s municipal solid waste for decades, NGT had called for removal of the garbage mound by segregating bio-degradable and non-degradable waste and then use the former in compost and latter in road construction.

KMC has in recent years attempted to scientifically cap a section of the garbage dump and convert it into a green mound with trees. The project has been funded by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board. NGT also asked Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation to exploit all possible tools to expedite the remediation of Mollar Bheri where the civic body dumps municipal solid waste from Salt Lake . The civic body had earlier been penalised by NGT for continuing to dump waste at Mollar Bheri.

Cleared

Chennai: Last Friday, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami welcomed a delegation from Haldia Petrochemicals and held initial parleys for establishing a Rs 50,000 crore petrochemical complex at Cuddalore. Two days later, he took everyone by surprise by announcing on Sunday his government’s intent to declare all the eight districts, including Cuddalore, of the Cauvery delta region as Protected Agriculture Zone.

For long CM Palaniswami has been accused by the opposition of running a 'slave' government of the BJP in the state . In one stroke, EPS has not only taken the wind out of the opposition sail over issues affecting the delta farmers, but is also seemingly taking on the Centre, which is keen to drive hydrocarbon exploration more aggressively in that region. He will need the support of the Centre to implement his intent.

Recently, when the Centre exempted hydrocarbon exploration projects from the need to hold public hearings and obtaining environmental clearances, a miffed Palaniswami shot off a letter to PM Modi and Union Environment minister Prakash Javadekar - questioning the Centre for skipping consultations with the state, before arriving at such a decision.

On Monday, the CM wrote to the Centre again, explaining the rationale behind his announcement to protect the Cauvery delta region. But, he ensured that it was hand delivered by his senior cabinet colleague D Jayakumar. It looks like EPS is keen to be a different person to different people and issues.

Saligao: The Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC) approved a surplus budget for the 2020-2021 financial year at a special council meeting held on Monday.

The consolidated budget has an opening balance of Rs 33.1 crore. Total receipts for 2020-21 have been pegged at Rs 79.7 crore and total expenditure at Rs 72.4 crore. The total closing balance for the current financial year stand at Rs 40.3 crore.

Reacting to the budget, councillor Sandeep Falari said, “We have not been serious in terms of recovery and implementation, either from receipts side or payment side. We are putting these figures on paper, but we have to see that those figures are actually realised.”

Acknowledging that the municipality is lacking as far as recovery is concerned, MMC chairperson Ryan Braganza said the civic body plans to strengthen its recovery team to ensure payments.

Further, stressing that the civic body does not intend on hiking taxes for the financial year, he elaborated on plans to tie-up with a private bank to make it easier for citizens and vendors to pay their taxes and dues

350,['11/02/2020'],BDU running distance courses sans UGC nod for five years,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Trichy: Bharathidasan University (BDU) has been running distance education programmes for the last five years without the mandatory approval of the distance education bureau (DEB) of University Grants Commission. It has come to light that the university was unsuccessful in its attempts to secure the DEB nod, but chose to offer the programmes without it.

The university became eligible to offer programmes through distance mode after being accredited with A+ grade in April last year in the third cycle of national accreditation and assessment council (NAAC). It is also likely to secure DEB approval for offering such programmes in future. However, questions are now being raised about the validity of certificates issued over the last five years by the university without getting due approval. Roughly 50,000 students have graduated in various distance education programmes with degree certificates.

Asked if institutions can offer distance education programmes without getting approval from DEB, New Delhi, its joint secretary, Avichal Kapur, told TOI over phone that only category – 1 institutions can do so and BDU doesn’t come under it. This has put the candidates who secured distance education degrees from the university in trouble. “We have been trying to get everything under the legal framework and NAAC score will enable us to get approval for the course,” said A Ilangovan, director in-charge of the centre for distance education, BDU. He said they have approached the ministry of human resource development seeking retrospective approval for the programmes apart from writing to DEB. “We only wish that the university gets DEB approval retrospectively for courses offered over the last five years. But we are sceptical if DEB will do so as the university was disqualified for not being eligible to run these courses,” said K Pandiyan, former president, Association of University Teachers (AUT).

Another senior faculty member said DEB had asked to suspend some of the programmes offered by many universities. “BDU too has suspended those courses from this year as seen in its admission notification released recently,” asked the faculty member. Questions are also being raised about the university not mentioning the status of DEB approval in the admission notification issued on January 26. “The university managed to sweep under the carpet the status of its approval from DEB. If the university is sure about getting DEB approval in the next few weeks, what prevented it from mentioning the same in the admission notification,” said another faculty member.

Panaji: Congress slammed state BJP spokesperson Narendra Sawaikar for condemning archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao’s statements on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Congress media cell convener, Trajano D’Mello said on Monday that Sawaikar’s statements proved that the BJP was trying to crush not only minorities but the underprivileged as well.

“By questioning why the archbishop does not criticise Article 30 of the Constitution, Sawaikar has further exposed his ignorance of the secular fabric of our Constitution,” D’Mello said.

Congress said that if Sawaikar could not accept the archbishop’s appeal for better sense on the CAA, National Population Register and National register of Citizens, then the former South Goa MP should “put on earplugs”.

“Sawaikar has exposed his autocratic DNA,” said the Congressman.

D’Mello said that Article 30 of the Constitution acts as a safeguard for minorities to run their institutions, where several Hindus also study.

“Sawaikar should also know that the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of Article 30 that was challenged,” D’Mello said.

KOLKATA: KMRC , the implementing agency of East-West Metro, on Monday told Calcutta high court that it has validation from experts of IIT-Chennai to resume tunnelling at Bowbazar.

While hearing a PIL filed by residents of Bowbazar on December 21, the division bench of chief Justice TBN Radhakrishnan and justice Arijit Banerjee asked KMRC to seek opinion of National Disaster Management Authority’s (NDMA) before resuming the tunnel-boring work between Bowbazarand Sealdah . The division bench had asked KMRC to submit the experts’ report to the court.

On Monday, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya , counsel appearing for KMRC, told the court that the report was ready: “We have taken the opinion of experts from IIT-Chennai. According to them, there are no difficulties in resuming tunnelling operations.” But the petitioners said they hadn’t gone through the experts’ opinion. The court then directed the petitioners to read the report within next 24 hours. The matter will be heard again on Tuesday.

East-West Metro’s tunneling operations has remained suspended since August 31 when one of the two tunnel boring machines (TBMs) hit an aquifer, leading to subsidence.

A vertical garden on a Metro pillar in Salt Lake

KOLKATA: Prodded by the urban development department, the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) will set up vertical gardens on the pillars of Maa flyover. The initiative will start on the EM Bypass stretch. This will act not only as a beautification drive but will also increase the green cover.

KMDA sources said it has been asked to prepare a project proposal for the vertical gardens on the pillars of Maa flyover. “Initially, about 10 to 15 pillars from EM Bypass end will be selected to host the vertical gardens. If the first phase is successful, the initiative would be extended on the Maa flyover pillars towards Park Circus,” a KMDA official said.

Structural engineers have welcomed the initiative, saying that it will help to increase greenery and boost the oxygen levels on stretches where pollution is high. “The additional load of the vertical gardens on flyover or bridge pillars is negligible. Such initiative is highly appreciated,” said construction engineer Anjan Kumar Dutta .

The vertical garden concept has become very popular in cities across the globe.

In New Town , Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) has already developed vertical gardens on several of the Metro rail pillars on the main arterial road. Hidco now plans to use internet-of-things (IoT) to facilitate watering the plants. The authorities have planted creepers such as bougainvillea and madhabilata to develop the vertical gardens on the Metro pillars.

More such gardens are coming up on Metro pillars, on which flower pots will be placed with jute or tin covers. An IoT device with a sensor will also be fixed on the pillars that would send an alert to the gardens’ control room whenever the plants need watering. Water pipes will be fixed with the vertical garden as it would automatically start watering the garden after receiving the signal.

Puducherry: As the ruling Congress party is planning to become the fourth state to pass a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi on Monday wrote to chief minister V Narayanasamy pointing out that the legislative power of the Puducherry legislative assembly does not extend to discuss or deliberate on citizenship matter as it falls squarely within the domain of Parliament and the Centre.

She said CAA is already under the adjudication before Supreme Court and cited relevant rules to declare that resolution of any matter which is under adjudication by a court of law is 'not admissible'.

Bedi in the letter said three members nominated by the Centre to Puducherry legislative assembly - V Saminathan, K G Shankar and S Selvaganabathy - called on her on Monday and submitted a memorandum.

She said the nominated MLAs in the memorandum said the ruling party proposes to bring a resolution in the legislative assembly against the CAA passed by the Centre on February 12. Bedi said they had given a representation to the Speaker of the legislative assembly V P Sivakolundhu urging him not to permit any discussion or resolution on CAA as it 'exceeds the power of legislative assembly under Section 18 (1) and 18 (2) of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963.

""In this regard, I would like to bring to your kind notice that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (No 47 of 2019) has been passed by both the Houses of Parliament and been assented by Hon'ble President of India and notified in the Extraordinary Gazette of India No 71 dated December 12, 2019,"" Bedi said in the letter to Narayanasamy.

She cited the Section 18 (2) of the Government of Union Territories Act, which read, ""nothing in sub-section (1) shall derogate from the powers conferred on Parliament by the Constitution to make laws with respect to any matter for (the Union territory) or any part thereof.""

Bedi said the law passed by Parliament (CAA) is applicable to Puducherry Union territory as well, which cannot be questioned or deliberated in any manner.

The three nominated MLAs in the memorandum to Bedi said any discussion on CAA violates the Constitution of India and infringes the rights of the Parliament. They cited reference (3) and (4) of Section 5 of the Administrators rules for the Puducherry legislative assembly. The rule empowers the administrator (lieutenant governor) to direct the Speaker of the legislative assembly to decline any resolution prohibited under it. The administrator can communication his decision to the Speaker and the administrator's decision will be the final.

""If any doubt arises whether any resolution of which notice has been given or any part thereof is or is not within the prohibition imposed by sub-rule (1) the administrator shall act in his discretion, decide the point and his decision shall e final,"" the nominated MLAs said in the memorandum while quoting reference (4) of the Section 5 of the rules.

Lt Cdr Jha at the Chandigarh run

VISAKHAPATNAM: Armyman and sprinter Milkha Singh was popularly known as ‘The Flying Sikh’ for his athletic accomplishments. What would one call the Navyman from Visakhapatnam who completed a 100-km run without rest in 8 hours 17 minutes to become the fastest 100-km runner on Indian soil?

Meet Lieutenant Commander Abhinav Jha , an officer of the Indian Navy based in Visakhapatnam, who recently completed the 100-km Tuffman competition in 8 hours 17 minutes 2 seconds in Chandigarh. He beat 22 other contestants. The cut off time for the competition was 15 hours. Lt Cdr Jha said he is self-training to participate in the world 100-km championships, which is scheduled in the Netherlands in September 2020.

Lt Cdr Jha achieved this feat during a stadium run by looping around 250 times on a fixed track. He didn’t take any walking breaks or relax during the run. “I had prepared several bottles of energy drinks beforehand and a friend handed me a bottle every four kilometres to keep me hydrated during the run. The only times I slowed down were to finish a drink. I, more or less, maintained an even pace through the run,” the officer said, giving credit to the Indian Navy and the Marine Commandos (Marcos) unit in Vizag for encouraging him and providing him the platform to participate in such activities.

Running on tough terrains is not new for this marine commando, but sprinting 111 km in the La Ultra - The High at an altitude of 11,000 feet in Leh, or in the Rann of Kutchh is no cakewalk. In 2018, Lt Cdr Jha also was the first of the Indian participants in the 100-km World Championship held in Croatia. However, his stint with long endurance running began only three years ago.

“Being a commando and training for it has definitely helped build my physical and mental fitness and the strength to go on for several hours,” said the 34-year-old Jha. He added that his fascination of the bright white uniform of Navymen and the Navy’s multi-dimensional (all terrain – water, air, land) charter of duties prompted him to join the Indian Navy.

As part of his self-coaching, Lt Cdr Jha walks 12-15 kms daily, runs 20-25 kms twice a week—some days he runs even 30-40 kms. He says prefers a balanced natural vegetarian or vegan diet and avoids packaged food. Lt Cdr Jha is gearing up to participate in the 12-hour stadium run in Gurgaon on March 1.

Panaji: The directorate of panchayats, through the Goa Solid Waste Management Corporation (GWMC), has constructed over 500 individual household latrines (IHHL) in rural areas as of January 31. The initiative is part of the government’s move to install bio-toilets for citizens who don’t have a basic household latrine.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the open defecation free (ODF) programme on October 2, 2014 under the Swachh Bharat Mission–Gramin. All states were affixed an October 2, 2019 deadline to eradicate open defecation. To ensure that Goa achieves the status of an ODF state, former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had said that the state government would install 60,000 bio-toilets, costing Rs 280 crore.

In a bid to achieve this, the state government planned to erect these toilets in rural and urban areas last year. However, while areas have been declared as ODF, installation of IHHLs as well as community toilets continues even in 2020.

After applications were opened in 2019, the state government received a total of 17,150 applications for installation of bio-toilets. GWMC then started issuing work orders to about five selected firms to supply the bio-digestor toilets.After installation started in September 2019, till date, a total of 472 IHHL toilets have been completed. In addition, 514 community toilets have been built in densely populated areas where houses are built very close to one another.

So far, the highest number of completed projects has been in Bicholim, with 155 bio-toilets erected. The region, however, showed a requirement of 1,710 units. The Ponda jurisdiction showed the highest requirement for bio-toilets with 4,143 units. Of these, 61 bio-toilets are in the process of being installed. The least requirement was in Sanguem with 622 units. So far, no bio-toilets have been installed there.

Panaji: The mercury rose by nearly three degrees to 20.9 degrees Celsius on Monday, disrupting the onset of mild winter chill that saw the minimum temperature drop to 18.1 degrees Celsius on Sunday — the lowest of the season so far.

It was the cool winds blowing in the evening that triggered the drop in temperature with the last few days seeing the mercury slide below 20 degrees Celsius. Sunday morning was the coldest due to the combined effect of the cyclonic circulation over Marathwada region of Maharashtra and the north-easterly winds.

All last week, the nip in the air could be felt after dusk . However, in contrast, the peak winter month of December witnessed the warmest nights in five decades and the minimum temperature did not fall below 21 degrees Celsius, causing farmer sof cashew and mango crops to worry.

India Meteorological Department ), Panaji, has forecast a slight rise in minimum temperature due to the dispersal of the cyclonic circulation. Within a day, the mercury rose by nearly three degrees.

The winds have been mostly northerly to north-easterly during the last few days. The day temperatures have been normal or near normal. Maximum temperatures recorded during the last few days have hovered around 31 to 32 degrees Celsius.

KOLKATA: ‘Timetable’ trials were repeated along the 5km Salt Lake tracks of East-West Metro’s first phase on Monday. Railway minister Piyush Goyal is due to flag off the section on Thursday.

The three-hour ‘timetable’ trials were conducted independently by Metro Railway personnel in a mock service in which the display boards flashed train timings and the public address system (PAS) announced arrivals and departures. A train took 13 minutes to complete the 5km ride between the terminals — Sector V and Salt Lake Stadium — stopping for 20 seconds at each of the six stations.

During the services, a rake will take three minutes for the changeover. All these specifications were fed into the system as the timetable software was loaded into the operations control centre (OCC), which is the control room that will automatically run trains from the Central Park depot in Salt Lake.

East-West Metro is equipped with the communication-based train control and signaling system that uses advanced telecommunication technology to run trains. The software has been prepared by Ansaldo, the company that has provided software integration between the trains, signaling system, tracks and platform screen doors.

365,['11/02/2020'],Uppal success spurs HMDA to go for land pooling in 3 more villages,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Representative Image

HYDERABAD: Buoyed with the response to land pooling scheme implemented at Uppal Bhagat near Nagole, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) has decided to implement land pooling schemes (LPS) at more places in the metropolitan region. The authority has decided to take up the scheme in Malkaram in Choutuppal mandal of Yadadri-Bhongir district, Bhogaram village in Ghatkesar mandal of Medchal-Malkajgiri district and Lemuru village in Kandukur village of Ranga Reddy district.

“On pilot basis the scheme will be taken up in three villages, where farmers have come forward voluntarily. It will be taken up in a major scale in later phases,” Sista Vishwanth, heading the land pooling wing of HMDA told TOI on Monday.

Under the LPS, if farmers come forward to give their land to the HMDA, it develops the land as per the norms and gives them the developed plots depending on their land. It became a huge success at Uppal Bhgat where the authority also got nearly Rs 1,000 crore in land auctions conducted in two phases.

Officials said it would be a win-win situation for both the farmers and authority. While the development gives developed land (minimum 30% of their land) to the land owners back, it gets some revenue by way of its share (including development cost). Land owners get good value for their share of the land.

Official sources said farmers of Malkaram have expressed their readiness to hand over 160 acres —100 acres in Bhogaram and 60 acres in Lemuru village. While Lemuru village is close to the proposed Pharma city at Mucherla in Rangareddy district , Malakaram is close to Apparel park and Vijayawada highway. Bhogarama is near IT corridor on Warangal highway.

HMDA has issued a GO and guidelines on LPS in December, 2017 where the minimum extent of the land should be minimum 50 acres to implement the scheme. A notification was issued by HMDA in November, 2019 for the scheme at Pratap Singaram and Mokila villages. It has announced survey numbers in both the schemes and conducted stakeholder consultation meeting.

The authority is waiting for the response from the farmers. The government says if more farmers come forward and HMDA develops it, it can arrest haphazard growth of the city.

366,['11/02/2020'],Large stretches of S Goa beaches witness untimely sand erosion,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Colva: In an unusual occurrence, huge stretches of the beach at Benaulim and Sernabatim are facing sand erosion again, at this time of the year, leaving fishermen, environmentalists and shack owners worried.

Villagers say that at this time of the year the sea usually brings sand that was eroded during the monsoon, back to the shore.

The coastal belt in Salcete shows erosion at Vaddy beach in Benaulim and at Sernabatim. At Vaddy beach, erosion has hollowed out cavities in the sand over half a metre tall along the shore.

The erosion is visible on the water line so that's less alarming, an expert said, pointing out that it would have been worse had it happened along the dune.

Retired NIO scientist Antonio Mascarenhas said that irrespective of where it has occured, erosion of this magnitude was quite significant and was definitely unusual at this time of the year.

“I strongly suspect the erosion took place due to winds from north which induce a littoral current towards the south. Human interference is also responsible for this. Beaches should be free of any interference, so sand can move freely”, he told TOI.

Beach restoration needs to be carried out, where lost sand needs to be dumped where it belongs, he said.

An environmentalist pointed out that Goa’s coastline took an unusual beating last year from various cyclones and other weather conditions. “The government is not paying attention to the eroding shoreline and it should put in more money to study this, and find a long-term solution to stop sand erosion,” the environmentalist said.

Shack owners are worried about the erosion, pointing to the space between their shacks and the water line of the sea, which they say is reducing every year.

A shack-owner said that in the last two years, sea water rushed into their shacks and in some cases, even destroyed their shacks, causing losses.

Fisherman Caitan Rodrigues pointed to the Casuarina trees at Betalbatim which have fallen and some whose roots are exposed, said, “These trees help in maintaining sand dunes. The government has not even bothered to undertake planting of more trees to replace these, and this has resulted in sand erosion.”

367,['11/02/2020'],Goa: Sugarcane farmers to hold back protest for 15 days,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Representative image

PONDA: After getting assuarance of an amicable solution in the next ten days, the sugarcane farmers have decided to hold back their protest for another 15 days.

Vice-chairman of the Goa Sugarcane Cultivators’ Association Harshad Prabhudesai said that chief minister Pramod Sawant has assured them that he will find a solution to the payment of canes and also starting crushing at Sanjivani Cooperative Sugar Factory.

Prabhudesai further said, “The chief minister has said that their payments have been delayed as the Laila Sugar Factory in Khanapur in Karnataka has failed to make payments on time.”

The farmers are demanding that their canes be crushed at Sanjivani plant either with modernisation or by setting up a new plant.

Presently, Sanjivani factory is shut for production, so the canes are sent to Laila Sugar Factory.

“The chief minister, during his visit to the factory on January 8, had promised to pay 70% of the cane price within 15 days of the supply, however, only 30% payment has been done,” Prabhudesai said.

“Since the payments are not on time, the farmers could not muster capital to cultivate new seedlings as it needs a sizeable amount to begin with land preparation and sowing the seeds,” the association vice president said.

Stating that late payments discourage farmers, he said, “Some years ago, there were over 1,500 farmers cultivating canes, but now the number has declined to around 940 farmers and if the situation continues, the number of farmers would decline further,” Prabhudesai said.

368,['11/02/2020'],"Counting to start at 8am, trends to start pouring in 3 hours later","This story is from February 11, 2020

New Delhi: Counting for the 70 assembly seats in Delhi will begin at 8am on Tuesday and trends will start pouring in around 11am. Officials said the votes will be counted at 21 locations in 11 districts. About 2,600 administrative officials will be involved in the process.

Though the official announcement of results will be done only in the evening, Election Commission officials said the winning candidate and the estimated margin of votes will be known by the afternoon. The smaller the size of the constituency, the sooner the result will be announced.

East Delhi district election officer Arun Kumar Mishra said the counting centres have a three-tier security involving the local police, CAPF and paramilitary forces. “The outermost ring will have Delhi Police personnel, while the second ring will have local police and CAPF. The innermost security ring will have paramilitary forces,” he added.

The counting centre at Commonwealth Games Village has been set up as a model centre with state-of-the-art facilities, Mishra said.

In all, 33 counting observers have been appointed to oversee the process. The counting of votes will start with postal ballots. Votes polled in EVMs will begin only after that. The EVM votes will be counted simultaneously at 10-14 tables set up for each assembly segment. Depending on the size of the constituency, the votes will be counted in 10-16 rounds.

After each round, the results will be uploaded on the “Suvidha” mobile app. Once all votes are counted, election officials will randomly pick VVPAT slips from five polling stations in each assembly segment and match the results with those generated by EVMs.

Paper chits with the number of each polling station in an assembly constituency will be put in a container and shuffled in presence of all candidates or their agents. The returning officer will then pick up five slips to tally with the EVM results.

“The paper trail of votes will be kept in separate bundles and then matched with the EVM results. The tabulation of paper trails will be carried out simultaneously. The result will be declared after completing the entire exercise,” said an official.

Meanwhile, Uttarakhand Congress unit’s vice president Suryakant Dhasmana strongly reacted to the statement saying, “Things trickle from top to bottom, and when the top-most BJP leaders make such baseless and meaningless statement against opposition party leaders, what can one expect from Rawat.

NAGPUR: Critically acclaimed Marathi play ‘ Ek Zunj Varyashi ’ tries to convey a message that a common man should fearlessly seek answers from his leaders. The play written by legendary playwright PL Deshpande is an adaptation of Russian writer Vladlen Dozortsev’s ‘ The Last Appointment ’.

The play was staged at Sai Sabhagruh , Shankar Nagar , on the first day of 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav’s Parallel Theatre Festival organized by National School of Drama , Delhi. The seven-day festival will continue till February 15, simultaneously in other cities like Delhi, Dehradun, Puducherry, etc. Seven plays — two foreign and five Indian — will be staged in Nagpur.

Shriniwas Narwekar is director of ‘Ek Zunj Varyashi’. It’s the story of a man who seeks an appointment with a minister (a former doctor) and when he gets the chance to meet him, he bluntly asks him to resign from his post.

Baffled, the minister and his colleague try to kick him out taking him for a bibber. But the man is adamant and attempts to seek justice for some other man wronged by the minister. A slew of arguments ensues which characterizes the body of the classic play.

The play depicts the pursuit of a common man for justice, accountability and transparency from his leaders. The nameless common man, played by Narwekar himself, is raw, unapologetic and fearless. Narwekar embodies him brilliantly.

Minister Dr Deshmukh is played quite convincingly by Deepak Karanjikar. Shobhna Mayekar plays wife Chitra to the common man and Ashutosh Ghorpade plays the minister’s colleague.

The thought-provoking play is a comment on the political situation witnessed by the country over the last many years. As the play progresses, the audience is forced to think are we really choosing the right leaders for us? The two-and-a-half hour play manages to keep the audience glued to their seats till the end.

371,['11/02/2020'],Touts continue to hound passengers at Central bus stand,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Trichy: There is a gag going rounds among the city folk that a visit to Trichy’s Central bus stand may land you either in Chennai or a hospital. It clearly indicates how the touts and agents, who sell tickets at the bus stand for Chennai-bound private buses, torment the passengers. IN a recent incident, a 39-year-old man was repeatedly assaulted by touts for refusing to board a private bus to Chennai after enquiring about the ticket fare.

Weekends at Trichy central bus stand are busy with people arriving from various parts of the state looking to board buses to Chennai. As the number of State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) buses is limited, passengers mostly depend on private buses. However, during weekdays, touts are deployed by private bus operators to sell bus tickets as passenger turnout is low.

On February 7, R Karthik, a native of Pudukottai, enquired about the ticket fare to Chennai with a tout. It is alleged that the touts identified as V Srirangam and M Venkatesh abused and assaulted Karthik for not buying tickets. ""I was told that such assaults are quite common near the Central bus stand but nobody complains. Since I registered a complaint, the issue has come out,"" Karthik told TOI. Two touts were arrested and remanded by the Cantonment police for assaulting the individual.

Police said that many touts work under a supervisor appointed by private bus operators to sell tickets. The touts are paid Rs 20 to Rs 50 for each of the tickets they sell. Since they will be paid only for the sold tickets, police said that the touts tend to harass passengers while pushing them to buy tickets. Sources said that around 75 touts on rotation operate at the Central bus stand.

Though it is an offence to forcibly sell tickets to passengers who prefer SETC buses, the touts were never questioned by the authorities. In the wake of the assault on a passenger, people urged the city police to take steps to prevent such incidents. ""We have already requested police to stop the touts form harassing passengers. But the practice is still continuing even after a man was assaulted last week,"" an official with SETC said.

Chandigarh: Justice Ranjit Singh, former chairman of the inquiry commission probing sacrilege incidents, has written to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, calling for action against all police and administrative officers who had either harassed or failed to attend to deceased witness Surjit Singh’s grievances.

Surjit (56) was a key witness in Behbal Kalan police firing incident of October 2015, and died of a heart attack on January 15. Family members of Surjit, former sarpanch of Behbal Khurd village in Faridkot district, have alleged that Surjit was under stress because of continuous harassment by Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) officials and others. “We can now bless his soul by taking action against all those who had harassed him no ends, against those whom he had filed a complaint against, and those who failed to listen to him and attend to his grievances,” reads the letter written by Justice Singh. “I think we are all responsible for failing the cause of justice (by) being insensitive to the plight of this person who suffered at the hands of police because he had helped the cause of justice.”

Justice Singh informed the chief minister that Surjit's wife had told him over phone that Surjit was harassed by some persons and agencies for making statement before the commission about police firing incident. “He (Surjit) had carried a serious grudge against one Manjinder Singh of his village and the electricity department had imposed a fine on him on the asking of influential persons,” reads the letter.

Surjit had approached Justice Singh on more than one occasion to highlight these issues. “I remember that I (Justice Singh) had spoken to SSP Faridkot and the electricity department in this regard. Remaining dissatisfied, Surjit had turned back to me again and again,” Justice Singh has written.

The former judge finally advised Surjit to file a petition before the high court. For this, the former judge had even arranged legal help for Surjit, states the letter.

Justice Singh had earlier written to the chief minister, the home secretary and the DGP to ensure that witnesses were not harassed for appearing before the commission. “To ensure this, there is a need to issue directions to SSP, Faridkot, making him personally responsible for security of this (Surjit) witness and to see that the complaint made by the witness to the police is attended to in accordance with law, and justice is done to him,” Justice Singh had directed.

The inquiry commission had also written to the human rights commission as well as the Lokpal for taking action against police officials responsible for acting against the witness. Justice Singh has now informed the chief minister,

“The concern expressed by the commission apparently has not received requisite attention. The police and the administration seem to have continued with their tirade against Surjit Singh without taking action on his complaints.”

Panaji: The Human Rights Commission, which was rendered defunct without any member or chairperson for more than six months, will soon be operational again. Last week the government issued a notification reconstituting the commission with retired high court judge U V Bakre as the chairman.

Retired principal district judge Desmond D’Costa has taken over as member of the commission. Retired judge and former law secretary Pramod Kamat, who has given his resignation as member of RERA, will join as member shortly.

The commission had 325 complaints pending with it as of July 26, 2019, when its only member, retired district court judge A D Salkar, completed his term.

With no member since July 2019, the commission has only been inwarding new complaints but not registering them. “The commission has to follow the procedure of scrutinising the complaints before registering them,” an official said.

In a number of cases, replies by parties have already been filed, but hearings have not been held. Parties will be given new dates soon, the official added.

The body hasn’t had a full fledged commission for many years now. It has been headless for close to four years after its chairperson and former chief justice of the Patna high court P K Misra retired in March 2016.

It was functioning with only a single member since September 2018 after J A Keny expired.

The commission would receive an average of five complaints each week and hear up to 12 cases each day on various human rights violations ranging from police assault, ill treatment of jail inmates, denial of pension and salaries, pollution of waterbodies, and , lack of common burial spaces for people across faiths and disrobing of women before cremation among others.

Agra: Ten days after a 24-year-old woman’s body was found in a nullah in Firozabad district, police arrested her husband.

The accused was identified as Jipender Singh, alias Bhupinder of Laduapura village under Basai Arela police jurisdiction in Agra district. He claimed that he strangled his wife for spending his money on her relatives.

Police said the accused had a love marriage with Lakhi Jaatav, who belonged to another caste, in 2015. The couple has a four-year-old daughter.

According to police, due to their inter-caste marriage, the couple and their families could not get along with one another. After their marriage, they shifted to a rented accommodation in Gokuleshpuram colony under Quarsi police jurisdiction, Aligarh, where accused, Jipender, worked in a private finance company.

Rajesh Kumar, superintendent of police (rural), said, “During interrogation, the accused claimed that the couple had problems from the initial days of their marriage. After their marriage, his wife constantly badgered him to shift to Aligarh permanently after selling off his ancestral property. After a while, Jipender came to know that his wife was spending his salary on her relatives and this infuriated him. Then, he plotted to get rid of her. On the night of January 29, he drove his wife and daughter to his ancestral village. After reaching home, at around 1 am on January 30, he allegedly strangled his wife to death. Later, he drove to Nai Tor village in Firozabad district and dumped her body in a nullah,”

Kumar said, “It was a pre-planned murder which he executed alone. But to dispose of the body, we believe, the accused took help of his relatives.”

Deceased Lakhi Jaatav hailed from Khandari Gadi village of Hathras district. Based on her father’s written complaint, Jipender was charged under IPC section 302 (murder) and ST/SC Act.

377,['11/02/2020'],Dilapidated Cortalim road raises risk for commuters,"Though tankers water the dusty road, the uneven surface is a death trap

TimesView The Cortalim stretch has been posing problems regularly due to the bridge construction work, yet the authorities never act proactively to ensure its upkeep. Knowing it is a narrow stretch and that too one that sees a huge traffic load, it is the responsibility of both the government and the bridge contractor to ensure the stretch is motorable and risk factors are mitigated.

PANAJI: It’s a rough ride for motorists, especially two wheelers, on the Cortalim road on NH 66 along which the new Zuari bridge is being built. Although steps were taken after the monsoon to level out the pothole-ridden road, it has deteriorated now, making riding a bumpy and back breaking experience.Although tankers water the dusty road, its uneven surface is a death trap. The lack of consideration for the common man can be seen in many stretches that are unsurfaced and full of rubble, resembling a dirt track, commuters said. On other stretches only a very fine narrow strip in the middle of the road remains intact, clearly not enough for the two and four wheelers who jostle for space on it. Slowing down and manoeuvring the uneven road, puts lives of two wheelers in danger.Excuses in the name of bridge work are not acceptable, motorists said. “This cannot be an excuse to damage old roads and leave them in this state for so long. Clearly contracts have been given out without proper planning. In certain parts, there’s a steep decent with no warning and suddenly there’s no road at all,” motorist L Godinho said.“If I don’t slow down, my car takes a battering. It’s very bad and unsafe for bikes. It’s just a question of PWD delivering better quality roads to commuters,” he said.Another citizen says public should not be made to suffer considering its their money being used for infrastructure works. “How long do we have to wait for the bridge to get ready. Earlier the excuse was the heavy monsoon. There is no excuse now,” businessman Blaise Cotta said.Principal chief engineer Uttam Parsekar said traffic cannot entirely be diverted on the newly-built concrete road alongside until work on the bridge overhead is completed. “This is temporary. After work is complete the traffic will be entirely diverted on the concrete road,” he said.PWD began taking the issue of dangerous potholed and uneven roads seriously and patched up stretches after the monsoon.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74077251,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-625769,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dilapidated-cortalim-road-raises-risk-for-commuters/articleshow/74071860.cms
378,['11/02/2020'],Kerala high court dismisses plea against Ramesh Chennithala,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Ramesh Chennithala

KOCHI: The high court on Monday dismissed a petition seeking registration of case against opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala for realizing damages during a UDF hartal against fuel price hike in 2017.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly considered a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Sojan Paviyanose, panchayat member of Madappally in Kottayam.

Chennithala had allegedly exhorted for conducting the hartal as chairman of UDF. As the leader of the opposition has cabinet rank and associated facilities, he should be considered as a public servant and a case should be registered against him, the petitioner had demanded.

Citing a full bench decision of 2007 (S Sudin vs Union of India and Others), the court pointed out that there is no ban against hartal as there is no legislation for it. Through the judgment, the court had directed the government to take necessary action to prevent violence on the basis of the reports filed by the district administration and police. The government is liable to prevent violence and damage to property during hartals and action can be taken against violators. The court’s judgment is applicable in the case of Chennithala also, the court pointed out.

Advocate T Asaf Ali had argued on behalf of Chennithala that the hartal was exhorted against the anti-people activities of the central and state governments and that only a peaceful hartal was called. Citizens have the right to protest peacefully and it cannot be prevented, the court said while dismissing the plea.

It was alleged by the petitioner that exhortation for hartal is in violation of Section 166 of Indian Penal Code (public servant disobeying law, with intent to cause injury to any person). Hartal was declared illegal and unconstitutional by a division bench in 2000 (Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi vs State of Kerala), the petition had stated.

380,['11/02/2020'],300 tribal people trying to stage a protest arrested by police in Valparai,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Coimbatore: The rural police detained 300 people from 16 tribal settlements who were trying to stage a novel protest by walking from Valparai to the district collectorate in the city – 120km on Monday morning. The protesters were let off in the evening. The protesters claimed that if the government fails to fulfill the demands of the tribal people, they would get legal permission from the court to conduct the protest.

On Monday morning, the 300 people started their walk and they were stopped by the Valparai police. Police detained the protesters and lodged them in a marriage hall. Later, they were let off.

S Thanaraj, tribal rights activist, said the tribal people gave authorities 15 days to fulfill their demands. If the government fails to fulfill, then they would get permission from the court to conduct the protest to walk to the district collectorate from Valparai for a stretch of 120 km.

As per the Forest Rights Act, the respective district administration should issue patta to the tribal people who are residing at various settlements in the hilly terrain. The tribal community people were also engaged with the agriculture inside the reserve forest. But they were not given any patta to enjoy the agricultural lands. Though many people from 16 tribal settlements from Valparai approached the revenue department and forest department to get patta for their residential areas and agricultural fields, their pleas were long pending.

The tribes demanded the district administration to provide alternate lands for the people of Kallarkadar settlement as earlier the settlement was completely damaged due to landslide and heavy rainfall. They also demanded the district administration to change all tribal settlements to revenue villages in the Anaimalai tiger reserve. Then only they would get drinking water, roads, toilets electricity, medical, education facilities and opportunities.

They also demanded the district administration to hand over the houses to people of Nagarooth tribal settlement near Sarkkarpathy.

Meanwhile, the forest department and revenue officials convened a meeting with the people of the 16 tribal settlements at Valparai on Saturday. Valparai AIADMK MLA Kasturi Vasu had sought 15 days’ time to fulfill their demands. But the tribes did not give any time. Each settlement has more than 20-30 tribal families and the district administration is expected a crowd of more than 600 people.

Valparai forest officer Senthil Kumar, Valparai tahsildar P Venkatachalam and officials from other department participated in the meeting.

381,['11/02/2020'],MP condemns slashing of annual funds for Jipmer,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Villupuram: Villupuram MP D Ravikumar condemned the Centre for slashing the annual budget for Jawaharlal institute of postgraduate medical education and research (Jipmer) in Puducherry for 2020-21 by Rs 100 crore when compared to that of the previous financial year.

In a statement, Ravikumar said the Centre allotted Rs 1,100 crore for Jipmer in 2019-20 financial year and the institute spent Rs 1,053.48 crore during the fiscal year well within its budgetary allocation. However, for the present fiscal year, the Centre allotted Rs 1,000 crore, which is Rs 100 less than the last fiscal year, he said.

""The institute spent 95.77% of its allocation in the last fiscal year. It did not overspend like a few other institutes in the country,"" Ravikumar said pointing out that Postgraduate institute of medical education and research (PGIMER), Chandigarh spent Rs 260 crore more than the budget allotted for the institute in the last fiscal year.

He said the Centre in the last budget allotted Rs 1,426.53 crore for PGIMER but the institute spent Rs 1,760 crore in the last fiscal year, which is Rs 260 crore more.

""It is unfortunate to note that the Centre is sidelining and ignoring Jipmer year after year. Jipmer does not only cater to the medical needs of the people in Puducherry but also a major number of people from different parts of Tamil Nadu besides attending patients from other states. Slashing the funds for the institute every year reveals the Centre's glaring partisan attitude towards Jipmer,"" Ravikumar said.

He urged the Puducherry government to take up the issue with the Centre and ensure adequate budget allocation for the institute.

Coimbatore: The issue of daily wage and domestic labourers being lured abroad with promises of fat salary packages, but facing exploitation and torture and being unable to return came to the fore again on Monday. Thenmozhi, a resident of Kavundampalayam, submitted a petition with the district collectorate to help her 26-year-old daughter Priya return safely from Riyadh. She said her daughter who flew to Riyadh three months ago to be a babysitter is being overworked.

Thenmozhi said her daughter was promised a salary of nearly Rs 25,000 a month to work as a babysitter for a family in Riyadh. “She was sent through two agents from Thanjavur and one from Dubai. My daughter agreed to go as it would help us financially,” said Thenmozhi.

In Riyadh, Priya was shocked to find that she was being used as a domestic maid and was made to work in three houses, Thenmozhi said. “She is also suffering because they make her work from before daybreak till late in the night, making her do all the housework, leaving her with less sleep. She is also falling often sick. Now the agents who took her there are demanding Rs 2 lakh to bring her back. They spent as much in arranging to send her to Saudi Arabia,” said Thenmozhi. “I request the collector to take action and bring back my daughter,” she added. tnn

Madurai: Former chief secretary of Tamil Nadu P Rama Mohana Rao hinted at starting a political forum involving various communities and unorganized workers, who have been left out by the political parties in the state.

He was in the city on Saturday to take part in the 437th birth anniversary celebrations of King Thirumalai Naicker organized by the Tamil Nadu Naidu Mahajana Sangam. Co-operative minister Sellur K Raju, revenue and disaster management minister R B Udayakumar, information and publicity minister Kadambur C Raju and Madurai district collector T G Vinay garlanded the king’s statue in Mannar Thirumalai Nayak Mahal in the city. Various outfits, leaders and people from public paid their respects. Cultural events too were conducted by Naicker and Naidu community outfits.

Talking to TOI, Rama Mohana Rao said that he is already in the political process and has been meeting people from various groups, communities and workers from unorganized sectors. Although launching a political forum may not happen immediately, it may happen later, he said. He categorically denied of starting any political party as of now. However, he said people around him and the situation will decide whether it would turn into a political party or not, he said. There are several communities who are missing in the political process. Each may be having 5 lakh or 10 lakh population, but no political party bothers about them. He would be taking up their issues as they do not have representation in the political parties, he said.

“I want to develop new leadership among every community by taking up leadership programs, which I have already started a few months ago. I wanted to create a space in the political spectrum for the unrepresented and under-represented in the political process. I will be doing social as well political service for them in the process,” he said.

There are already 5,000 cadres solidly working towards the political process and 5000 more will come into the fold in a few months, he said.

386,['11/02/2020'],"Go to Pakistan, BJP MP tells poet Munawwar Rana’s daughter","This story is from February 11, 2020

AGRA: BJP MP from Aligarh Satish Gautam has asked social activist Sumaiya Rana , daughter of leading Urdu poet Munawwar Rana , to go to Pakistan since she claims to be “feeling suffocated in today’s India”.

Sumaiya Rana visited Aligarh on Saturday and addressed anti-CAA protesters of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and accused the police of using “coercive measures” to crush protests against the amended Citizenship Law and said such measures are “very suffocating” for the people. “Strategies to polarise are being formed every time in today’s India which is creating a suffocating atmosphere. Though every community, including Dalits, Christians, is involved in anti-CAA protests, government is blaming only the Muslims,” she said.

Talking to reporters in Aligarh, Gautam said that if Sumaiya is feeling suffocated in India, where she can take liberties to say such things then she should go to Pakistan. He said, “It is unfortunate that she speaks such language in a country where she lives with full freedom. This would not be possible in Pakistan.”

Gautam questioned as to why Sumaiya did not speak when women from her community were feeling suffocated due to “triple talaq”. “BJP government was the one which gave justice to the victims of triple talaq by enacting a law against it, but she never said anything in this regard,” he said, adding that she is supporting only JNU, Shaheen Bagh and AMU.

The BJP MP claimed that she had given this statement solely to vitiate the peaceful atmosphere of the campus, where a few students have been protesting against the CAA since December 16. “I was not expecting this from her as she belongs to a very cultured family. She should have taught good things to students, who are raising slogans against the country,” said Gautam.

He also warned of action against students protesting against the CAA on the AMU campus. He said, “Those who are protesting on the campus will be out from the varsity from the next academic session as they have all been identified by the police.”

“Government’s aim is to guide students first and if they don’t understand then they will face action like Dr Kafeel Khan , who addressed anti-CAA protesters here and was later arrested by police from Bihar,” said the MP.

Sumaiya visited the university with student leader Maskoor Ahmah Usmani, former president of AMU students’ union. The social activist told reporters, “We are holding all-women protests which are completely peaceful and as per the democratic rights, but as we have seen in Lucknow, the UP police is using coercive measures to crush our protests.” She tried to address women protesters at Shahjamal Eidgah, but was denied permission by the police.

The jubilant supporters of AAP reflected a middle India in all its exuberance and none of the machismo

With the temperature soaring alongside Aam Aadmi Party’s seat tally , euphoria met exhaustion at the small AAP headquarters on Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Marg. As the results came in, party members and volunteers erupted in joyous abandon. And why not, it was the third straight victory for AAP since 2013 and perhaps the most difficult given the bitter counter-campaign by BJP. “Delhi voted for vikas, simple,” said Vimlesh Kohli, an AAP municipal councillor, adding, “This is a vote against galat soch (bad intention).”

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

“I have never seen them so happy,” said Shivani, a volunteer with a US-based consultancy and who has worked for AAP for six years now. “They are always stressed — cases are being slapped, offices sealed, something or the other.”

“We fought the first campaign on sachai (honesty), this one on kaam,” said Sanjay Gupta, offering kachori and bread pakoda.

This was middle India in all its exuberance and none of the machismo. Daily struggles don’t leave time for curled moustaches or manicured hands. No Ray-Bans and no fancy totes. Just a sea of Gandhi topis etched with ‘AAP’ and a broom.

“The party stays with the ordinary man. It thinks for the ordinary man,” gushed an ex-BJP, ex-Congress and now “confirmed AAP” well-wisher.

The frenzied dancing was to a party song booming on loop over the small lawn — ‘Saari Dilli bole dil se lage raho Kejriwal’ (Delhi’s own song, keep at it Kejriwal). The quintessential Dilliwala slipped into the baraat mode of dance as the Hari Om band and the dholakwallas joined in. Groups of men, headgear showing their faith — Muslim, Sikh and others in the AAP topi — posed for cameras and selfies. Women in hijabs with babies wearing AAP caps posed for the multiple media swarming the party campus. For every TV camera, a group would splinter off to do a special jig. Everyone was happy to strike a pose, no matter that the media bandobast took up so much ground. At the gate, a party man handed out caps and managed the constant stream of people — “Topi lo, aage badho”. A rare nano in the portico stood almost like a symbol to the ordinariness of the space.

Suresh, in his 60s, quietly watched the revelry from a shaded area. Steady of voice, his weathered face wore no joy, only relief. “This is the ordinary man’s victory. This is precious. The patriwala (street vendor), the cleaner, the repair-wala.”

He stood with a phalanx of party associates, their brows at times furrowed as performance on some seats caused heartbeats to quicken. “It’s a win, but 10 seats are too many to give away (the projected tally was at the time 60-10). Many rounds are still left, but…,” smiled Monce Abraham who campaigned for the party from Chandni Chowk to Nehru Place, Kalkaji to Karol Bagh.

The revelry was peppered with digs at BJP, which had used the Shaheen Bagh protest against the controversial citizenship law to polarise the election on communal lines. One poster read ‘Current laga kya’ with Amit Shah’s face on it while another co-opted Ram into the AAP campaign saying, ‘Ram’s rule has beat the rakshas’.

Some AAP members belted out Bharat Mata ki Jai and Vande Mataram, albeit to a tepid response from the rest of the crowd which just couldn’t get enough of the Kejriwal song. AAP netas asked revellers to take ‘Bajrang Bali’s prashad’, it being Tuesday. Inquilab Zindabad was thrown in for good measure.

The gleeful jabs were reserved for BJP’s Manoj Tiwari — “Hope he doesn’t suffer a heart attack” — and Tajinder Bagga — “He will not be able to show his face, he is so full of hate”.

Sanjay Singh said Amit Shah put in his muscle, money and scorn into the campaign, but “the results were on the work done”.

Not ceding an inch, he reiterated to the crowd, “Your son was called a terrorist. Now Delhi’s family of 2 crore has shown the country that her son is a ‘kattar deshbhakt’. It was said it would be a Hindustan vs Pakistan match, so Hindustan has squarely won.”

Everyone had their own ideas about Kejriwal’s priorities going into the third term. But what about Shaheen Bagh? “It can be resolved in a day. Take back the law. At least the Union government must speak to the protesters. Baat toh karo,” said Kohli.

“Elections are over, let us see now. I can speak for Seelampur. We will now see what steps to take to address the protesters’ issues,” said Shahbuddin Ansari of Vidhan Sabha 65.

“The fight is on.”

To a question if a separate place for isolation, rather than a ward in a hospital, would have been safer, Rane replied that the state was following WHO guidelines as well directions issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare.

A ward each in Goa Medical College and hospital, Bambolim and Cottage Hospital at Chicalim, have been earmarked to quarantine and treat suspected cases of nCoV.

Coimbatore: The city corporation is gearing up to widen Sathy Road in north zone to reduce traffic congestion. The plan is to widen the road from Velan theatre to Ganapthy bus stop for about 300 metres.

A source with the city corporation said they had submitted a proposal to the state government to widen the road at a cost of Rs 7.18 crore and sought fund under the infrastructure an amenities fund. “We are waiting for the approval.”

The source said the project would require land acquisition. “We need to acquire 10ft land each on both sides of the road. Upon widening the road, which sees heavy traffic movement, traffic congestion would come down to a larger extent.”

The city corporation has also made a proposal to the government to widen Nallampalayam Road that connects Mettupalayam Road and Sathy Road for about 5.2km at a cost of Rs 27.88 crore.

Pointing out that the plan was to widen the road anywhere between 50ft and 80ft, the source said the project wouldn’t be possible without acquiring land, which would cost around Rs 4.24 crore.

The move is expected to reduce traffic congestion on 100ft Road and Thudiyalur-Saravanampatti stretch in the city as a lot of commuters would use Nallampalayam Road.

The proposal to widen Nallampalayam Road was first made in 2014 and a year later a landowner had donated the city corporation 13 cents land along the road for the project. But the project has not taken off till date.

Thiruvananthapuram: In view of effectively managing the increasing influx of devotees to Sabarimala temple every pilgrim season, the state police have mooted utilizing the Virtual Q system of the police to regulate the movement of pilgrims to Sannidhanam.

The idea was mooted at a high-level meeting of police officers convened at police headquarters on Monday to review the performance of the police in the pilgrim season that just concluded.

One of the main concerns that came up in the meeting was the increasing number of pilgrims every year, making crowd management a difficult task for the police. It was suggested that if all pilgrims used the Virtual Q system to book darshans, then the police would know the number of pilgrims that might turn up at Sannidhanam each day and thereby make necessary arrangements to ensure their smooth movement. Presently police are often forced to restrict pilgrims at Pamba to prevent Sannidhanam becoming overcrowded, which in turn might lead to a stampede.

It was decided in the meeting to put forward this suggestion before the state government for their consideration.

State police chief Loknath Behera, in a statement released here, said if the government approved the suggestion, the upgraded Virtual Q system could be made functional by March 15. A five-member team of top officers led by Thiruvananthapuram city police commissioner had also been formed to visit all the south Indian states and sensitize the authorities about the new system.

Gandhinagar: Four BJP members of Parliament (MPs) met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and handed over a written representation, demanding removal of three communities from the list of communities included in scheduled tribes (ST) in Gujarat.

MPs Jasvantsinh Bhabhor, Prabhu Vasava, Geeta Rathva and Mansukh Vasava met the PM and requested him to direct the state government to remove the Rabari, Charan and Bharwad communities from the list of STs. The MPs contended that members of these communities are not tribals.

The representation by the MPs could cause further worry for the Vijay Rupani government, which is facing the heat because of protests being held by different communities over the reservation policy of the government in its Lok Rakshak Dal recruitment process.

Speaking to reporters, the MPs claimed that a few families of the Rabari, Charan and Bharwad communities living in the Gir, Barda and Alech forest areas were originally granted ST status. However, in 1972, the Baxi commission included these communities within the OBC quota. The MPs contended that even while enjoying reservation under the OBC quota, members of these communities are seeking benefits under the ST quota as well.

Calangute: The medical facilities at government health centres and hospitals in Goa are the best amongst all states, said chief minister Pramod Sawant.

Talking at a ceremony held to lay the foundation stone of the Candolim primary health centre’s (PHC) new wing on Monday, Sawant said that Goa was the only state where government hospitals provide free facilities and medicines, and even specialised treatments like angiography and angioplasty.

Sawant, who is an Ayurveda doctor, recalled that he had spent a year practising ayurveda at the Candolim PHC around 15 years ago.

“Once the new building is ready, it will become a community health centre, with emergency treatment facilities,” health minister Vishwajit Rane said, adding, “It will be a showpiece PHC with international quality facilities,” Rane added.

Calangute MLA Michael Lobo said the state government has sanctioned Rs 20 crore for the new wing of the PHC. “When Manohar Parrikar was chief minister, he had sanctioned Rs 10 crore and now Pramod Sawant has sanctioned another Rs 10 crore. It has been our dream to have a modern medical facility in Calangute-Candolim, and now that dream is coming true,” he said, saying that the existing PHC was built 48 years ago, when Shashikala Kakodkar was CM.

The new wing is being constructed by the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation.

Coimbatore: A day after chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami announced the Cauvery delta as a ‘protected agriculture zone’ and said the state would not give its nod for hydrocarbon projects there, CPI state secretary R Mutharasan on Monday asked the CM to clarify whether the state would enact a law in this direction.

“The Centre has already given permission to Vedanta and ONGC to extract hydrocarbon from the region. The CM should clarify whether these permissions would be revoked,” said Mutharasan, who was speaking to reporters in the city. Terming that the announcement was long due, he said the state should enact a law in this regard in the assembly session that begins on February 14.

Speaking of IT searches, he alleged that the income tax department was acting as a wing of BJP and accused the party for using I-T to intimidate its adversaries. “In the recent searches on the premises belonging to film financier G N Anbu Chezhiyan and others, Rs 77 crore cash and documents were seized. There have been talks that this money belongs to prominent politicians. The I-T department should unearth whose money it was and should identify them,” he said.

On the TNPSC scam, he said it has rocked the state and has undermined the faith of the public, parents and students on the commission. “Around 14 people have been arrested in connection with the scam. They are all low-level employees. There should be a thorough inquiry as to who were the high-level people who were involved in the scam. We seek a CBI probe under the supervision of the Supreme Court.”

Ahmedabad: With the Union government remaining firm on phasing out sales of BS-IV vehicles from April 1, two-wheeler dealers across the city are jittery over clearing inventory of BS-IV compliant vehicles. Estimates by dealers suggest that inventory worth Rs 100-120 crore of BS-IV-compliant two-wheelers has piled up in Ahmedabad alone. This amounts to a stock of vehicles that lasts up to a month and a half.

“Despite discounts, sales have remained muted, owing to the impact of slowdown. Customer footfalls are also significantly low at showrooms and discounts as high as Rs 10,000 on vehicles priced around Rs 65,000 are not proving enough to convince customers into buying. The demand is still good for popular models but for others, it continues to remain low-key,” said Rajesh Patel, a city-based two-wheeler dealer.

Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA) had also made a representation to the Union government, urging to defer the date for stopping sale of BS-IV-compliant vehicles. However, since the decision was taken by the Supreme Court, the government denied the request.

With barely a month and a half to complete phasing out of sale of BS-IV compliant vehicles, dealers are not just concerned over clearing pending inventory but are also struggling to get finance. “Dealers keep the vehicle inventory on finance because not all have deeper pockets. However, Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) have tightened norms and as a result, dealers are not getting funding for BS-IV-compliant vehicles,” said Pranav Shah, director, FADA – Gujarat.

Vehicle sales have overall remained muted in Gujarat due to the slowdown. According to data furnished by the Union ministry of transport, 1.10 lakh vehicles were registered in January 2020 in Gujarat, declining by 14.18% against December 2019, when 1.2 lakh vehicles were registered in the state. In fact, vehicle registrations showed a consistent de-growth for three months in a row since November 2019.

Kozhikode: CPM politburo member Nilotpal Basu said that the most important factor in the ongoing battle to protect the Constitution of the country is to forge the broadest possible unity between various sections of people, irrespective of ideological differences.

Speaking after inaugurating the golden jubilee celebration of the Calicut University employees union at the varsity campus at Tenhipalam on Monday, he said that all sections of people, castes, communities, identities and genders cannot be brought together in the fight to uphold the legacy of the country without forging such a broad unity.

“What we need the most today is unity. Our ideologies, we will defend to our last breath. But beyond ideology there are sections of people with whom we have our differences, with whom we have had very bitter battles in the past. But unless we salvage India and the Indian Constitution, what remains?” he said.

He said that the unified fight against the policies that are undermining education and employment will create a common platform for the larger struggle for the defence of the Constitution.

“Modi want to take us to a new India. But in the struggles that we are witnessing, another new India is born and that is the hope for the future,” he added.

He said that the country was going through a critical juncture as right-wing forces and the central government were trying to divide people and to systematically weaken and politicize all institutions, including higher education sector, election commission and the armed forces.

402,['11/02/2020'],High court upholds legality of VACB,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Kochi: The high court has upheld the legality of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) as a wing of police empowered to investigate and prosecute offenders in corruption cases.

A division bench of Justice A Hariprasad and Justice N Anil Kumar considered two petitions by K Karunanidhi of Edava and K T Mohanan of Idukki, challenging their prosecution by Vigilance on corruption charges.

Only a police officer not below the rank of a DSP can investigate corruption cases as per Section 17 of Prevention of Corruption Act. The petitioners argued that the police officers deputed to Vigilance department ceases to be ‘police’. The government had set up an anti-corruption machinery named ‘X-Branch Police’ through a government order in 1960 (Ext.P3). In 1964, home department issued an order constituting a separate department named ‘Vigilance Department’, separated ‘X-Branch Police’ from police department, and placed it under the administrative control of a director. In 1997, ‘Vigilance Department’ was renamed as ‘Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau’. As police personnel were deputed to VACB, they cease to be part of ‘police’, the petitioners argued.

Senior public prosecutor Suman Chakravarthy argued on behalf of the government that VACB is nothing but a unit or branch of the police force. Police officers working in VACB remained to be police officers and the challenge against the 1964 order (Ext.P4) is devoid of any factual or legal basis, he contended.

In the judgment, the HC held, “On a thorough consideration of the pleadings, records placed before us and arguments advanced, we are of the view that various challenges raised against Ext.P4 in these cases are legally unsustainable…. Intent and purport of Ext.P4... is only to streamline the working of X-Branch created as per Ext.P3…. We have no hesitation to hold that the source of power for issuing Ext.P4 can be traced to the Police Act, 1960.”

The judgment further said, “…VACB is only a continuation of X-Branch… Later, it was transformed into vigilance department… Police officers working in VACB cannot be said to be officiating after their powers are denuded. Petitioners’ contention that VACB is only a government department formed for conducting a preliminary investigation and after completing such preliminary investigation the case ought to be handed over to the DSP functioning in the law and order stream cannot be accepted.”

Finally, the court said, “... we hold that the Police Act, 1960, which itself was enacted in accordance with the authority under List II in the 7th Schedule to the Constitution of India, confers power on the State Government to issue Ext.P4. Contentions raised by the petitioners, that the registration of crimes, conduct of investigations, arrest of accused persons, filing of final reports and prosecution of cases in accordance with Ext.P4 are illegal, cannot be sustained...”

403,['11/02/2020'],"Maharashtra: Green cess up to Rs 10 likely on every bottle of IMFL, country liquor, beer","This story is from February 11, 2020

The state is looking to make an additional Rs 1,000 crore in 2020-21

MUMBAI: A government official said on Monday that the state was likely to levy up to Rs 10 green cess on each of the 350 crore bottles of IMFL and country liquor and 125 crore bottles of beer sold annually in the state to generate additional revenue. “Instead of enhancing the excise duty, it was proposed to levy green cess per bottle. Exact quantum of green cess will be decided later, but it will be up to Rs 10 per bottle,” the official said.

On lowering excise duty on premium brands of imported liquor, the official said that excise duty in the state is the highest in the country. The official said the imbalance encourages large-scale smuggling of imported liquor from neighbouring states, leading to loss of revenue.

“We found that for a bottle of premium brand of imported liquor, Maharashtra was levying an excise duty ranging between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000, whereas in most states it was below Rs 1,000. We have proposed rationalisation of the duty structure on imported liquors. We expect that we will continue to garner the same amount of excise duty owing to more consumption of liquor,” the official said.

The official said excise on premium brands of imported liquor is much lower in Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and New Delhi. “It was always believed that Maharashtra is charging the highest excise duty on imported liquor. We will reduce it suitably, so that our revenue mobilisation is not affected adversely,” the official said.

The official said that compared to Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the state target for excise duty is much lower owing to it having fewer shops. In UP, the number of country liquor shops is 14,000 and the excise duty target is Rs 29,000 crore.

In TN, the target is Rs 31,000 crore. In Andhra and Telangana, the target is Rs 38,000 crore. “In Maharashtra, there are 4,000 country liquor shops and 1,400 IMFL shops. We have not given new licences after 1974. We have imposed total ban on liquor in three districts — Wardha, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli,” the official said

Kochi: The President on Monday appointed advocate P V Kunhikrishnan as a judge of the Kerala high court. Swearing-in ceremony is expected to be on Thursday.

A notification regarding the appointment as an additional judge for two years was issued by ministry of law and justice on Monday afternoon. Judges are appointed as additional judges initially and are then appointed as permanent judges later on.

The Supreme Court collegium’s recommendation for appointing high court lawyer Kunhikrishnan as a judge was originally issued in October 2018. In February last year, the collegium led by CJI Ranjan Gogoi had reiterated its recommendation for appointing Kunhikrishnan as a judge of the Kerala HC after the central government objected to its initial proposal.

After completing schooling at Payyannur, Kunhikrishnan graduated in law from Kerala Law Academy at Thiruvananthapuram. He had enrolled as an advocate on December 17, 1989. Practising at Kozhikode district and sessions court and other subordinate courts from January 1990, he shifted practice to the high court in October 1993. TNN

Panaji: A total of five fishing boats from neighbouring states were impounded in the financial year 2019-20 for illegally fishing in Goa’s territorial waters and the exclusive economic zone.

The exclusive economic zone comes under the jurisdiction of the government of India.

With LED fishing banned in Karnataka and Maharashtra, trawlers from these states are coming into Goan waters to fish, ports minister Michael Lobo had said in November 2019. As a result, the state government was in the process of notifying rules to impose stringent fines on bull trawling and LED fishing.

Currently, the fisheries department conducts routine sea patrolling up to 12 nautical miles along the Mandovi-Zuari coast to curb illegal fishing and showcause notices are issued to owners of fishing vessels caught.

The authorised officer appointed under Section 3 of the Goa Daman and Diu Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1980, impounds vessels caught fishing in the territorial waters of the state under Section 18 and Section 19 of the act.

If the state’s fishermen are caught carrying out LED fishing the, their fisheries subsidies are withheld and fishing licences suspended for a duration depending on the gravity of the offence.

In 2017, officials from the department were deputed to inspect fishing vessels twice a week at the Cutbona jetty to check if they were using LED lights, fish light attractors or any other light equipment.

Coimbatore: The school education department would issue the third and final show-cause notices within March to unrecognized schools in the district, officials said.

Last year, the department had said there were 205 unrecognized play schools and 40 unrecognized nursery and primary schools in the district.

Following this, block education officers visited the schools, took notice of the violations, and had issued first show-cause notices to these schools.

“As there was no reply for first show-cause notices, the department had issued notices for the second time. If there is no reply to these notices as well, the department would send a final show cause notice before March. If there is no reply and if the schools don’t comply, the schools would be sealed through the district administration,” a school education official said.

Following the show-cause notices, of all the unrecognized play schools, only around 10% had submitted documents for approval, the official said. Documents such as building plan approval and land documents among others must be submitted for the approval.

“Of those play schools which submitted the documents, only a few had proper documents. In some cases, even if they complied to all norms in their infrastructure, they did not show proper documents,” the official said. “Several of these play schools are run in rented residential buildings. They don’t have proper safety facilities such as safety exits,” the official added.

Last year, the directorate of school education had directed chief educational offices to crack the whip on unrecognized schools. It had asked CEOs to identify such schools, make their status public by putting up public notices and shut the schools with the aid of the district collector.

Coimbatore: Around 1,900 teachers in the district, who teach Class IX to XII in government high and higher secondary schools, will be trained to handle differently abled students. The training sessions, which are conducted by Samagra Shiksha under the Inclusive Education of the Disabled at Secondary Stage (IEDSS) scheme, will be held from Wednesday to Friday in four educational districts in Coimbatore.

Officials said subject teachers along with special educators who exclusively handle differently abled students will be trained in the programme. “They will be made to understand the psychology of differently abled students, how to teach them and how to make them mingle with their classmates,” said a Samagra Shiksha official.

With the most of the differently abled students in the secondary level are in Class IX and X, the training will mainly focus on teachers from those classes, the official said.

Under the IEDSS scheme, differently abled students were brought to mainstream classrooms from special centres. “There are 659 differently abled students from Class IX to XII in government high and higher secondary schools in the district. We would train teachers to be sensitive and to understand their issues. We held such training sessions previous years too,” the official said.

The teachers will be trained on handling children with various kinds of disabilities such as visual disability, hearing impairment, orthopedic disability and psychological disabilities. Special educators who handle differently abled children would be the resource persons for the training sessions, which would be held in three batches.

Earlier this year, 221 disabled students were given aid equipment such as hearing aids, walkers, multi-sensory inclusive educational (MSIED) kits and cerebral palsy chairs, through a subsidy from Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India (Alimco). They will also receive exemptions and aid in board exams such as scribes, extra time and exemption from language papers, depending on their ability.

Representative Image

AGRA: Paediatrician Dr Kafeel Khan , who was accused of making an inflammatory speech at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), was granted bail by an Aligarh court on Monday. Chief judicial magistrate Karuna Singh granted relief to Khan on a bail bond of Rs 60,000. Two surety bonds of Rs 60,000 each would also be furnished by the guarantors.

Khan’s lawyer Mohammad Irfan Gazi told TOI, “The court was told that Khan was falsely implicated by police under political pressure. After hearing the arguments, the court granted him bail.” Khan will be released on Tuesday as his papers are under process, he said.

The suspended doctor was arrested by UP police’s special task force (STF) from Mumbai on January 29, when he reached the city to attend a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. He was arrested in connection with a case registered against him in Aligarh under section 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion) of IPC at Civil Lines police station on December 13. The case was filed after his speech at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU).

Khan was remanded to judicial custody for 14 days in Aligarh on January 31 and was later transferred from Aligarh to Mathura jail.

According to the FIR, while addressing students, without naming anyone, Dr Kafeel said that ‘Mota Bhai’ is teaching everyone to become Hindu or Muslim but not a human being. “This is a fight for our existence. We have to fight,” said Kafeel as per the FIR.

He said through CAA , the government “has shown that India is not our country”.

The FIR also states that Dr Kafeel made an attempt to vitiate the peaceful atmosphere and disturb the communal harmony with his speech.

Dr Kafeel was in the news in 2017 when he figured as one of the nine accused in a case involving deaths of several children due to alleged disruption in supply of oxygen at the BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur .

Ahmedabad: Former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi said on Monday that people must trust judges. He was speaking at Gujarat National Law University ( GNLU ) as part of ‘We, The People’ lecture series. “The matter [CAA] is pending before the Supreme Court. Trust your judges. They will decide according to the Constitution,” he said.

Justice Gogoi said that everyone might have a view on the CAA and have the right to express it. “Protests have been held, viewpoints have been expressed. Enough,” he said. “You can’t have two parallel forums,” he said, referring to the issue pending at the Supreme Court.

This was Justice Gogoi’s first public lecture after he retired from the Supreme Court in November 2019. “I thank Gujarat for giving me freedom — the first smell of freedom of speech,” he said. “Judges don’t have the freedom of speech.”

Justice Gogoi also referred to students in his home state who called off protests after sundown to prevent any violence. He said that this constructive role played by the students helped improve the law and order situation ‘overnight’. “Perhaps the most important fundamental duty is to the respect the unity and integrity of the country,” he said. Assam was the first state where protests broke out after the CAA was passed by the Parliament in December last year.

In his lecture on ‘Rebuilding the Judiciary: Nation Building’, Gogoi said that many don’t want to become judges today. “Good people are backing out, saying sorry sir, we don’t want to get into this,” he said. “Look at our appointments system — the day a name is recommended, 100 letters are sent against him, alleging from A to Z. He doesn’t get appointed. He doesn’t become a judge and his professional and personal lives are shattered.” He appealed to the law students to address the problem.

Justice Gogoi also praised the role of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and said that if Patel had been around for 10 years after India’s independence, the country would have been different. He later called for rebuilding the judiciary, ‘the way Sardar Patel built the nation.’

411,['11/02/2020'],Centre wants report on MP’s missing Swachh toilets,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Bhopal: A day after TOI reported that 4.5 lakh Swachh toilets across Madhya Pradesh have gone missing, the Union government sought a report from the state government.

Sources told TOI that the Centre has sought a reply from Swachh Bharat Mission in Madhya Pradesh on the report. Confirming it, state programme officer of Swachh Bharat Mission (rural), Anurag Verma said, “We have informed (the Centre) that 4.51 lakh toilets were found to be missing in the primary survey we carried out. We ourselves found the discrepancy. An exhaustive second verification by district-level officials is going on. Actual figures will be available then.”

Several political leaders of the state also raised the issue on social media. State Congress chief spokesperson Shobha Oza hit out at the erstwhile BJP government (the irregularities took place between 2012 and 2018), saying: “Apart from Vyapam, dumper, illegal mining, Simhastha, e-tendering, mid-day meal and other scams, Rs 540 crore worth Swachh scam also happened in which 4.5 lakh toilets went missing with the connivance of government and officials.”

Calling the tenure of former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan as ‘andhkar yug (dark age) of scams’, Oza said a preliminary probe pegs the scam at Rs 540 crore, and a detailed probe will unearth more.

Minister Jaivardhan Singh said, “Respectable Prime Minister, you could also make Shivraj Singh Chouhan the brand ambassador of Swachhta Abhiyan”. Former MP Arun Yadav wrote, “When I was state Congress president, I had raised the issue of scam in toilet construction. Now, I demand that the chief minister order a detailed probe and take action against the accused.”

Another senior Congress leader, former minister Sajjan Singh Verma, said, “As many as 4.5 lakh toilets worth Rs 540 crore have gone missing. Shivraj Singh Chouhan should say who did this and under whose patronage.”

State Congress shared it on its Twitter handle and took a dig at Chouhan, urging him to “sometimes tweet on his own actions”.

On February 1, TOI reported that 4.5 lakh Swachh loos have vanished in Madhya Pradesh, along with the Rs 540 crore it took to build them. Pictures of the toilets, taken as proof of money spend, were geo-tagged but the scamsters found a way to dodge technology. Officials who have investigated it believe the photos of toilets were taken within 6 metres of the site where the loos were supposed to be built. In most cases, pictures were taken in front of neighbours’ toilets, officials say.

It’s a reminder of the toilet door scam unearthed in Guna district in 2017, where the iron doors of 42,000 toilets were built 10kg lighter, leading to siphoning of crores.

Kottayam: In a rare incident, police have sent a social background report against four minor students, including three girls, in a cyber-related case to juvenile justice board.

The report was prepared after their classmate, a girl, gave a statement against them to the police. Police said the students had gone for a study tour recently and the complainant girl had lost her mobile phone during the trip. The girl who grew anxious over this suspected that the phone was in the custody of the other four students.

Fearing that the other students will misuse the photos in her phone and circulate morphed photos of her along with another boy, the girl later attempted suicide. She is recovering in a hospital now. When police recorded her statement at the hospital, she named the four students, based on which the police prepared the social background report against them.

Meanwhile, her lost phone was found from the school and the principal handed over it to police on Monday. Cyber cell will examine the phone and further probe will be based on the cyber cell report, said police. Police said that no case was charged against them as they are minors. TNN

Vijayawada: Untimely rains have pulled the rug from under the feet of farmers across Krishna district.

Scattered rains from Sunday morning have particularly affected farmers cultivating black gram and paddy this Rabi season. The weather across the district changed all of a sudden on Saturday night. Black gram grown across thousands of acres in Kankipadu, Gudivada, Vuyyuru and Machilipatnam were ruined in the rains.

“Black gram is one of the main crops in Krishna district after the completion of Kharif season. It needs very less water. We have noticed good flowering and hoped a good yield this year, but unseasonal rains are worrying. The rain will increase chances of viral infections and pests,” said K Rama Narayana a farmer from Komatigunta Lakulu.

Untimely rains have damaged flowering of mango crop in Nuzivid. “It is the third consecutive year that rains have affected mango farmers. Crops damaged during the flowering stage will affect the quality of fruit,” said K Narasanna, a farmer from Edhara village.

Benz Circle, Patamata, Gundala, Ramavarappadu areas received scattered rain on Monday evening. Devotees attending Gunadala Mary Matha festival were inconvenienced. Day temperatures have come down to 28 degrees Celsius and relative humidity levels touched 78 percent on Monday. Potholes on the city roads were filled with rainwater and a few drains overflowed. Sanitation workers swung into action and desilted the drains at problematic locations. The mosquito menace has increased in colonies adjacent to irrigation canals across the city. Authorities of Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) said they are making special arrangements to repair roads damaged by untimely rains.

Officials were using advanced technology to repair potholes.

Meanwhile, a medical student who had returned from China and put in home quarantine complained that her parents, who ran a shop, were unable to open the shop as neighbours objected to it.Despite only three confirmed cases of coronavirus in Kerala and state government’s best effort to control the spread of the globally-hit disease, there seems to be an underlying prejudice against those who are quarantined.Data from health department’s mental health rapid response team that was set up on February 3 to deal with issues faced by those who are quarantined at home and in isolation ward points towards this. Of the 2,600 people contacted till Sunday evening, around 200 complained of some sort of mental concern, with majority — 77 persons — complaining of some or the other form of stigma that they or family members faced after being quarantined.Incidentally, these experiences are not just limited to families and individuals. “Recently, we received a call from a child on our helpline who complained that his classmates were teasing him as his father had visited China in the recent past. They asked others to stay away from him, calling him coronavirus,” said a health official.To check this, the health department has taken proactive steps to sensitize people by creating awareness about the infection. “Due to our robust district mental health programme, we have been able to connect with people and provide them support. If we learn any quarantined person is facing any kind of stigma, we immediately ensure that the community is made aware of the service the person is doing to the society by strictly agreeing to be home quarantined,” said Dr Kiran P S, who is heading the mental health rapid response team.If the stigma is limited to a specific area, then the health officer from that area is informed about the same to conduct sensitisation and awareness programme, with a message to support those who have agreed to go for home quarantine. Till Sunday evening, the 215-member team had reached out to 2,600 persons.“While the major concern for those home quarantined was social stigma, those admitted to the isolation ward had anxiety issues and loneliness,” added Dr Kiran. Their main worry was whether they would test positive and once tested negative, their concern was whether they would be infected by another person admitted in the isolation ward or a health provider who interacts with an affected patient.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/alone-they-fight-the-stigma-too/articleshow/74071033.cms
415,['11/02/2020'],Discrepancy in UIDs of 2.5L students,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: With the second-round cross-checking of UID details of students in government , aided and unaided schools getting over, unique IDs of more than 2.5 lakh students have been rendered either fake or unavailable.

State government ventured into the second round of UID verification exercise after UID details of more than five lakh students were identified as wrong or missing. School authorities who offer state syllabus are supposed to share details of student UIDs with the government using a web portal hosted by the education department.

As against the questionable details of over five lakh students received on the web portal at the start of the 2019-20 academic year, the second-round stock-taking exercise has identified the details of as many as 2,51, 544 students as unavailable or incorrect. This, however, shows that 2.28 lakh students whose UID credential were under a cloud have come clean.

Following the mismatch in student strength, the government had given school authorities more time to correct the UID details and had warned of strict action against those who fail to do so.

The government claims a huge spike in the number of students joining government and aided schools in the state in recent years as a result of the public education rejuvenation mission. Without touching upon the fudging of student strength, identified after two verification drives, finance minister T M Thomas Isaac, in his budget, proposed measures to stop the practice of aided school managements making teacher appointments by bending rules which are directly linked with the number of students in each class.

In its report submitted to director of general education on January 25, 2020, Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education, the government agency entrusted with the task of UID verification, said schools have not even filled up the UID column against more than 1,13,537 students. Since the central and state agencies claim almost 100% UID enrolment in Kerala, the government should take seriously the claims about so many students having no UID at all.

Close to 50,000 UID details shared with the government through Sampoorna portal don’t even match with the UID format. KITE report said such mistakes, despite schools given an additional chance to correct the UID details, call for urgent attention.

More than 90 lakh UIDs uploaded in the Sampoorna portal did not match the UID database. This could happen in the case of even minute difference in the details such as name, birth date and gender of the students in school records and UID.

Meanwhile, reports say glaring mismatch has been identified in the number of students registered with the state Pareeksha Bhavan for the 2019-2020 SSLC examination as against the student details schools had shared with the government at the beginning of the academic year. Since the mismatch continues in glaring proportions, the government would have to carry out manual verification in each school to find out the real strength of students.

Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh government would withdraw the exemption granted to women and children riding two-wheelers from wearing helmets. This was stated by deputy advocate general, Praveen Dubey before the division bench of M P High Court headed by the Chief Justice AK Mittal during hearing of a PIL challenging the exemptions extended by the government.

The state government amending the MP Motor Vehicles’ Act, had exempted women from wearing helmets while riding a two-wheeler. A student of National Law Institute University (NLIU), Himanshu Dixit, has filed a PIL challenging the exemptions.

Dubey told the high court that state government would revoke the exemption of compulsory helmet clause for women driving a two-wheeler or women and children below 12 years of age riding pillion.

Following this, the bench comprising chief justice, Justice AK Miital and Justice V K Shukla fixed the case for hearing on March 2, giving two-week time to the state government to do the needful.

Presenting his argument on the plea, Dixit said it was against fundamental right of equality. Besides, it does not do them (women and children) any good and only jeopardize their safety, he said.

In the previous hearing, Dixit had presented fatal road accidents involving women before the judges following which the court issued notices to the state government and other respondents seeking their response on the issue.

Gaur underwent a refresher course at the Uber office in Mumbai before his suspension was revoked.

“I am disappointed by the Uber advice and have decided to follow my judgment, continue to remain alert and do what needs to be done as an alert citizen,” Gaur told TOI. He began plying cabs from Tuesday night. “Uber officials told me to ensure that every trip should be completed. While this sounds good from business point of view, what about national security and the whole idea of alert citizens helping cops?” he said.

An Uber source said safety of riders is the top priority, and passengers’ complete details could be provided to cops after a passenger is dropped. ""If a similar incident recurs, there is a risk of riders lodging a case of abduction if forcibly taken to a police stations,” the source said.

The 23-year-old poet Bappadittya Sarkar said, “I don’t have anything personal against the driver , which is why I did not press charges against him. I did not want him to lose his job. My only problem was my personal safety was threatened. What if tomorrow this happens to a girl?”

Gaur said he was law abiding and would always ensure the safety of passengers.

A statement from Uber on Tuesday said, “High-quality service is something we strive for every day. Following our internal review and to meet our standards, we enrolled the driver for re-sensitisation of our policies and community guidelines.""

Sources said during the refresher course, the driver was informed about the things to follow and avoid, Last Saturday, Gaur was felicitated by BJP MLA Mangal Prabhat Lodha in Mumbai for being an “alert citizen”.

Sanjay Hegde, a Supreme Court lawyer, said, “Uber refusing to take action means it endorses its driver’s behaviour.” On February 5, Gaur had taken the Jaipur poet to a police station after overhearing his participation in CAA protests. The driver allegedly told him to be grateful he was not taken “anywhere else”.

Calangute: Health minister Vishwajit Rane on Monday said he has no plans to start a new political party or destabilise the government as is being rumoured. “I want the chief minister to know that I am not going to run away from this government. I am going to stay with BJP and will continue with it for the next assembly election and we will form the next government,” he said at Candolim in the presence of chief minister Pramod Sawant.

Speculations arose in political circles after the Sattari Yuva Morcha, backed by Rane, figured in the list of political parties registered with the Election Commission. It was registered in 2016.

Sawant said some politicians were trying to create confusion. “There are some who have nothing to talk about and have become insecure because they’re not part of the government. This government has been working to improve and complete numerous projects,” he said, citing the completion of the Canacona Manohar Parrikar bypass road among other works. tnn

Vijayawada: A private school teacher was sacked by the school management on Monday for misbehaving with students during a trip to Kondaveedu fort.

The teacher was identified as Jargumalli Venkateswara Rao who also works as a village volunteer.

According to sources, Rao is a teacher at a private school in Pamidipadu village. During the weekend, the students were taken to a field trip to Kondaveedu Fort where Rao allegedly misbehaved with girl students. Sources said he sought sexual favours from some of the students and used sexually explicit abuses against some of them.

The students then informed their parents about the teacher’s antics. A few parents wrote to the school headmaster about their wards’ ordeal and the school management dismissed Rao based on a internal inquiry report.

The city has seen a rise in crimes against women and children in the recent past. Though authorities have introduced a slew of measures for their safety, a lot more needs to be done.

Guntur: The Forest department has decided to revamp the ecological park in Kotappakonda, the abode of the famous Shiva Temple near Narasaraopet. The department is planning to complete a few of the works before Maha Shivarathri. District forest officer (DFO) N Ramachandra Rao visited the ecological park atop Kotappakonda and reviewed ongoing works with officials.

He directed officials to set the focus on providing amenities to pilgrims coming for Maha Shivarathri. “We are completing maintenance works on a war footing as the festival is fast approaching,” the DFO told TOI.

He said they were planning to construct a nature walk facility, souvenier shop and Mokka Prasadam on Kotappakonda before the festival. He said that the department would offer different medicinal plants to the pilgrms as mokka prasadam to encourage them to grow plants after returning home. He said the nature walk track would also create awareness among pilgrims about the importance of growing plants, particularly medicinal plants. “It is expected that 4-5 lakh pilgrims will visit Kotappakonda during the two-day long Maha Shivarathri festivities. It will be a big occasion for the department to create awareness among such a big crowd at a single destination,” said Ramachandra Rao.

He said they were also contemplating to set up terracota artefacts and utensils at Kotappakonda, Uppalapadu and Perecherla Nagaravaan to attract more tourists and pilgrims. He said the artefacts museum would become a big attraction as it would draw tourists from different parts of the country. He said they would provide employment to artisans. “We will ready a comprehensive blue-print for taking up developmental works on Kotappakonda shortly,” said Ramachandra Rao.

He explained that they were also planning to take up a slew of works on Kondaveedu fort for the facility of the tourists.

425,['11/02/2020'],Muslim shift to AAP complete,"This story is from February 11, 2020

New Delhi: Delhi’s Muslims have traditionally voted for Congress but shifted allegiance to the fledgling AAP in 2013 . The support, which became more pronounced in 2015, appears to have become absolute now. On Tuesday, as results of the 2020 Delhi Assembly elections were announced, this was most glaringly evident at Okhla .

AAP’s Amanatullah Khan, who received more than 1.3 lakh votes, defeated BJP’s Braham Singh by a margin of 71,827 votes, one of the biggest in this election. In the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, Khan had defeated Singh by a margin of 64,532. While the margin by which Khan had won last time was also huge, the biggest difference has been in the fortunes of Congress.

In 2015, Asif Mohd Khan of Congress had garnered 20,135 votes but this time three-time Congress MLA Parvez Hashmi got just 5,107 votes. In the Muslim-dominated Okhla constituency, Khan got 66% vote share, while the once popular Congress got just 2.5%!

Okhla is important as Shaheen Bagh, epicentre of the protests against the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act, is part of the constituency. While AAP focused on the development plank, Shaheen Bagh was used as a polarising poll plank by BJP across the city. AAP didn’t take a clear stand on the anti-CAA protests and kept a safe distance from Shaheen Bagh while Congress was vocal against CAA and NRC. In its manifesto, Congress had promised to pass a resolution in Delhi Assembly against CAA and ask the central government to withdraw it. It had also promised that if it came to power, it would not implement NRC and will not implement NPR in its current form. But the community didn’t see it as capable of keeping BJP at bay.

“AAP did not take a stand on Shaheen Bagh, which was very disappointing, but this was very carefully calibrated and Muslims still voted for them,” pointed out Neera Chandhoke, former professor of political science at Delhi University. “This was because Congress was just not mounting its campaign and the party was visible only in the last few days before polling. It is a party without direction with wrong people at the top and voters do judge the efficacy of people at the top,” said Chandhoke.

AAP performed very well in other Muslim-dominated constituencies of the city too. At Seelampur, which too has been witnessing anti-CAA protests, AAP’s Abdul Rehman defeated BJP’s Kaushal Kumar Mishra by 36,992 votes and Congress stalwart Chaudhary Mateen Ahmed came a close third. At Ballimaran, AAP’s Imran Hussain won by a margin of 36,178 votes, while Congress bigwig Haroon Yusuf could garner only 4,797 votes. At Matial Mahal, AAP’s Shoaib Iqbal won by a margin of 50,226 votes, while Congress candidate Mirza Javed Ali received only 3,403 votes.

“It is wrong to think the minority votes in a bloc...However, the community is not economically well off. Kejriwal has helped them,” said Ravi Ranjan, assistant professor, Zakir Hussan Delhi College, Delhi University.

Kozhikode: The special investigation team (SIT) probing the Koodathayi multiple murder case, filed a chargesheet in the sixth and final case on Monday. The SIT filed the chargesheet in the murder of Annamma Thomas , wife of Ponnamattam Tom Thomas, before the Thamarassery magistrate court naming Jolly Joseph as the accused in the case.

Jolly murdered Annamma by mixing ‘Dog Kill’, a poison to kill dogs, in mutton soup, said K G Simon, Kozhikode Rural district police chief. According to police, except Annamma, the five other victims were killed using cyanide. The chargesheet has 1,061 pages and contains 79 documents to prove Jolly’s involvement in the murder. This is the only case in which Jolly is the lone accused. Two others who provided cyanide to Jolly are the accused in other five cases.

Annamma was murdered on August 22, 2002. The poison was mixed in the soup a day before it was served to avoid foul smell and bad taste, police said. “She decided to serve the poison-laced soup as Annamma had the habit of having mutton soup every day,” Simon said.

Police also claimed to have recovered the prescription collected by Jolly from Kozhikode veterinary hospital to purchase dog kill. The prescription is one of the major documents presented by the police in the chargesheet.

Annamma was the mother of Roy Thomas, Jolly’s first husband. “It was Annamma’s persistence to send Jolly for work that forced her to commit the murder,” Simon said. Jolly had completed only pre-degree. But she lied to Roy’s family that she was a post graduate.

According to the chargesheet, Jolly was afraid that she would be caught red handed if she wass forced to go for work. “Besides, she was hopeful of gaining control over the Ponnamattam family by murdering Annamma,” Simon said.

The case was probed by a team led by K K Biju, inspector of Perambra.

Munesh Godara

GURUGRAM: Haryana BJP Kisan Morcha leader Munesh Godara, who was allegedly shot dead on Saturday night by her husband Sunil — a private security officer and a former Armyman — had suffered domestic violence and abuse for several years, her family alleged on Monday.

Sunil Jhakkar, brother of 35-year-old Munesh, told TOI that after Munesh wed Sunil Godara at the age of 15, she never managed to lead a ‘normal married life’ as her husband often used to beat her.

In 2013, Jhakkar added, Munesh had tried to kill herself by consuming poison after she was thrashed and locked inside the house by Sunil. This was the same year Munesh was appointed as the BJP Mahila Morcha chief in Haryana, a post she held till 2016. “We filed complaints against Sunil at least 15 times for domestic violence,” said Jhakkar.

Sunil Godara’s father Dalip Singh, who was the original complainant in the case, had accused his son, along with two others, Bunty Gujjar and his Anu, of murder. Singh had told police that the couple often had arguments because Sunil suspected Munesh had an affair with Gujjar.

On Monday, Jhakkar submitted a complaint to the police commissioner accusing Sunil and Dalip Singh of conspiracy for murder. Jhakkar, who was accompanied by Gujjar, dismissed all allegations against the latter, saying, “Claims of my sister having an affair are rumours.”

According to his complaint, “Sunil Godara and his father had made a plan to kill my sister. He had been beating her ever since they got married.” He also alleged that the father-son duo had been eyeing the property that was in Munesh’s name.

Jhakkar said on Saturday, he dropped his sister to her Spaze Privy house in Sector 93 around 9:20 pm. “My younger sister Manisha was speaking to Munesh on the phone when she heard her saying that she has been shot,” he said.

At the time of the incident, Munesh had been working in the kitchen. The couple’s children — a son and a daughter — were also present in the house. Dalip had said in his complaint that after their argument escalated, Sunil took out his revolver and shot Munesh.

Sources said Sunil had then put the gun to his head, but was stopped by his son. He fled thereafter. Police, which formed teams for the investigation, are trying to locate him, said ACP Prit Pal.

Sunil was earlier employed with the Army and had been forced to take voluntary retirement due to his conduct.

Bhopal: Answering to sensitivities of millions, Madhya Pradesh Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has been equipped with a microbiology laboratory, that can detect animal fats or ‘pashu charbi’ in food as well as milk products.

The new lab worth Rs 17 crore was inaugurated by health minister, Tulsi Silawat, in Bhopal on Monday.

It is the first microbiological laboratory of the state at the FDA office at Idgah Hills in Bhopal. “Things are going to change now . Those involved in food adulteration will not go scot-free,” said Silawat.

Until now, state FDA could only conduct simple chemical tests, like level of content of nutrients in food. With microbiological tests, the lab technicians will be able to conduct detailed tests. “Animal fat can now be detected. Contaminants that can cause food poisoning can also be identified in the new lab,” said MPFDA nodal officer, Arvind Kumar Pathrol.

Presence of pesticide including urea, detergents, heavy metals added in food can also be diagnosed, in the high tech lab. Initially four machines, each costing about Rs 4 crore each has been installed. Equipment worth Rs 80 lakh is expected to installed in the Idgah Hills lab, in the next few days.

Amaravati: Sparing commoners, Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) has increased power tariff for high-end consumers in the state. APERC chairman justice CV Nagarjuna Reddy released the retail supply tariff order at a media conference on Monday.

According to the new tariff, consumers using more than 500 units per month are required to take an additional burden of Rs 0.90 per unit. The tariff for 500-plus-units consumers has been fixed at Rs 9.95 per unit. It was Rs 9.05 per unit in the previous tariff order. APERC chairman said his team had carefully studied the proposals of AP Southern Power Distribution Company Limited and AP Eastern Distribution Company Limited and went through objections filed by the general public before proposing the new tariff.

Justice Reddy said about 1.35 lakh domestic and industrial consumers would have to pay additional charges due to the increased tariff. He added that they had taken every care to avoid burdening the poor and commoners, and so have proposed the hike only for those consuming more than 500 units per month. He pointed out that both discoms would require Rs 44,840.97 crore for the purchase and transmission of power during the coming fiscal while their revenues stand at Rs 30491.90 crore, leaving a deficit of Rs 14,349.07 crore. He explained that increased tariff would reduce the burden to the tune of Rs 1,394.97 crore. The commission had determined the revenue gap of both the discoms to be Rs 10,060.63 crore after taking purchase and sale values into account.

He said the commission had reduced the gap by Rs 2,893 crore after making a detailed study of the proposals filed by the discoms.

He said the commission had agreed to the state government’s offer of paying Rs 8,353.58 crore to meet the subsidy costs for supplying 9 hours of free power to the agriculture sector. He said they have readied a fool-proof action plan for interruption-free supply to agriculture pump sets.

He said the government subsidy amount was increased due to the increase in the supply hours and they have directed discoms to find-out ways to reduce the burden on the government without levying burden on farmers. Interestingly, the commission had turned down the discoms’ proposal to increase tariff for the railways and directed to supply power at the present rate of Rs 5.50 per unit.

The commission took the decision after taking the objections filed by SCR into consideration. The commission, however, said that the tariff for railways was relatively less in AP when compared to the other states. The commission had also rejected the requests of big farmers to extend free supply to corporate farmers saying there was no justification in their contention.

MUMBAI: To ease the stress on state coffers, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has decided to levy a green cess on Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL), beer and country liquor. If that comes as a downer, there is good news too, as excise duty on premium brands of imported liquor will be “rationalised” to make them more affordable, a move expected to increase revenue by generating higher sales.

This way the government aims to mobilise an additional Rs 1,000 crore in the next financial year, said an official. The official said the green tax would be up to Rs 10 per bottle on all IMFL, beer and country liquor. “We may not be able to achieve the target of Rs 17,477 crore for the current year. There may be a shortfall of Rs 800 crore. In such circumstances, it was felt a new strategy was required to mobilise an additional Rs 1,000 crore.”

DARODA ( WARDHA ): A pall of gloom descended on Daroda village after Ankita Pisudde ’s death spread like wild fire. There was anger and grief everywhere.

“After we got the news of Ankita’s death, no one from our village went to work,” said Gopal Hatwar.

Ankita’s relative, Kumud Shegukar of Sewagram village, said, “I want to request the government to protect women from such incidents. This is a serious issue.”

Another relative, Umesh Chaudhari from Sastabad village, said, “We lost our bright daughter who was intelligent and had a bright future. What was her fault? The government must take stringent action.”

The whole village has demanded capital punishment for the accused. Ankita’s body reached the village at 12.30pm. Villagers stopped the ambulance. They wanted the accused, Vikesh Nagrale , in their custody to set him ablaze. Some villagers pelted stones to vent their anger. The police had to resort to lathicharge to control the emotional crowd.

Ankita’s mother Sangita blamed the society. “Ankita would have been alive had we discouraged her from becoming a postgraduate. Whenever we brought up the topic of her marriage, she didn’t show any kind of interest as she wanted to do PhD. She was a leading light of our family.”

Social activist Ragini Shende said “There is fear in other villages as parents do not wish to give their daughters in marriage to grooms from our village.”

NAGPUR: Ankita Pisudde , 24, a college teacher from Hinganghat in Wardha , who had been set afire near her college on February 3 by a stalker, died in a hospital at Nagpur in the early hours of Monday.

Her attacker, Vikesh Nagrale , had been arrested shortly after the attack by MIDC Bori police of Nagpur rural, and booked by Hinganghat police for attempt to murder by setting Pisudde afire with petrol. After her death, Nagrale, who is now in Wardha jail, has been charged with murder.

Pisudde’s death triggered outrage and protests in Wardha district, especially at Hinganghat, where a bandh was observed. Police had to cane charge unruly mobs at Daroda, Pisudde’s native place, where her body was taken in an ambulance for last rites. The protesters pelted stones and smashed the windshield of the ambulance. Cops were also targeted with stones, after which they lathi charged the agitators.

A candle march was also organized at Wardha city on Monday evening.

Senior PI Satyaveer Bandiwar of Hinganghat police station said three platoons of State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) and Riot Control Police (RCP) have been pressed into action.

Earlier, there was drama outside the mortuary at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) too, as Pisudde’s family members and friends were reluctant to allow the post mortem, and receive the body. They first wanted the government to give in writing that Pisudde’s brother Prajwal would get compensatory employment.

Led by Pisudde’s maternal uncle Prashant Kohle, the protesters raised a demand to hand over Nagrale to them. “Even if for 10 minutes, hand him over so we can make him feel how it pains to get burned,” he said during an impromptu sit-in outside the mortuary at GMCH.

Amid the agitation, a four-member forensic team comprising associate professor HV Pathak, assistant professors Dr Deepak Sangle and Dr Priyanka Patil , under head of the department Dr AA Mukherjee completed the post mortem in less than an hour.

Wardha guardian minister Sunil Kedar, who was present to expedite the post mortem, managed to convince agitators to allow the ambulance to roll out of the hospital with the body after the procedure. Kedar and the outnumbered police physically pushed agitators out of the way of the ambulance. Former city guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule too had reached the place.

Earlier, Pisudde, a post graduate in botany, was declared dead at 6.55am by the team of doctors attending on her at Orange City Hospital and Research Institute (OCHRI). The hospital bulletin cited the cause of death as ‘septicaemic shock in patient of 35% Grade III deep dermal burns with inhalation injury’.

Already on ventilator since February 7, Pisudde’s health had started deteriorating in the last couple of days. In the wee hours of Monday, a team of five doctors; Dr Rajesh Atal, Dr Darshan Rewanwar, Dr Ninad Gawande, Dr Ritesh and Dr Anup Marar, struggled for nearly two hours to revive Pisudde after her condition deteriorated at 4am. The doctors were able to maintain her blood pressure, but the highly fluctuating oxygen level in the blood could not be improved. Her family too was alerted about the deteriorating condition.

At 6.30am, Pisudde’s health deteriorated for the second time. This time, she suffered ‘bradycardia’ or slower heart rate along with the other complications. She was administered a prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Despite efforts, Pisudde sank beyond any revival attempts and was declared dead.

435,['11/02/2020'],Electricity panel junks discoms’ bid to nix deal with pvt plants,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Amaravati: In what could be a setback to the state government, AP Electricity Regulatory Commission ( APERC ) has turned down the power discoms’ proposal to not purchase power from private renewable energy plants. Making a guarded review of the issue keeping in view the pending writ petitions before the high court, the commission observed that ignoring power purchases from plants is unwise.

The YS Jaganmohan Reddy government has been trying to scrap power purchase agreements (PPAs) made by the previous TDP government with renewable energy plants since it came into power. APERC while readying the tariff order for 2020-21 took power produced by renewable energy plants into account. Curiously, APERC had advised discoms not to entertain request of Lanco Kondapalli for renewal of PPA and directed it to take over the plant as per guidelines. Lanco Kondapalli is owned by former MP Lagadapati Rajagopal’s family.

The discoms have been arguing that the power from these plants is not dependable and variable.

However, APERC observed that non-inclusion of energy from wind and solar sources in the power purchase estimates would not only be unwise but also legally unsustainable. “Therefore, the Commission has decided to include wind and solar energy in the availability and despatch as per its own estimates based on the data furnished by the discoms and power purchase cost calculations for FY2020-21 are done accordingly,” said the commission chairman Justice CV Nagarjuna Reddy.

The commission pointed out that AP State Load Desptach Centre (APSLDC) has not placed any material to prove that these sources are causing grid instability and security problems during the last two years. “Since the aspect is subjudice before this commission and also before the High Court, any expression of views at this stage is likely to prejudice interests of either party in the pending litigation,” said commission.

The explosion, which the police claimed was caused due to leakage of gas from an LPG cylinder, left two houses... Read More

PATNA: Altogether seven people, including six members of a family, were injured in an explosion inside a two-room flat on the first floor of a four-storey building at Salimpur Ahra under Gandhi Maidan police station in the state capital on Monday. The condition of one of the seriously injured, Gangajali Devi (70), is stated to be critical.

The injured have been admitted to the PMCH with burn injuries. The explosion, which the police claimed was caused due to leakage of gas from an LPG cylinder, left two houses badly damaged. A joint team of the state FSL and the ATS later visited the site and collected evidences from there.

The incident took place around 8am in the densely populated locality, which is hardly 200 metres from the Gandhi Maidan police station. The debris and damaged articles scattered all around bore testimony to the intensity of the explosion. The locals said they heard the explosion sound in a radius of one kilometre.

A police team led by City SP D Amarkesh first reached the spot and inquired about the incident. Later, Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma visited the spot and subsequently went to the PMCH to know about the health condition of the seven injured.

“A small sized LPG cylinder kept in a room yesterday got leaked due to damage in the connecting pipe. The accumulated gas in the room having no ventilation created a shock wave leading to explosion,” the SSP told the media.

He said the cylinder couldn’t explode as it had emptied by the time one of the family members tried to lit fire in the kitchen. In addition, two other empty cylinders kept in the room were found to be intact. “There is no evidence of explosion due to any explosive. This has been confirmed by the forensic experts,” he said, adding that the 2x5 inches thick brick walls erected without use of any ‘saria’ (iron rods) collapsed due to the impact of the explosion.

House owner Nitu Devi said she had rented out the flat to one Baidyanath Mahto, an autorickshaw driver, about three months back. “We had asked him several times to provide the photocopy of his Aadhaar Card or any identity proof, which he deliberated delayed. As he was living in the flat with his family, we couldn’t suspect any foul play,” she added.

Nitu stays with her family in another house and reached there after being informed about the incident.

The injured were identified as Baidyanath Mahto (50), his wife Rekha Devi (45), mother Gangajali Devi (70) and three children, including Tolu, Mahi and Manisha. Rekha told the police that she caught the fire when she had gone to boil the water in a pot in the morning. “What happened later is not known to me as I fell unconscious,” a police officer quoted Rekha as saying.

A tenant, Tarkeshwar Pandey, who lived in an adjacent room, also received injuries in the incident. Pandey’s relative Sandeep said he helped the injured get admitted to the PMCH for treatment.

The neighbouring house of Anil Kumar Singh was also damaged in the incident. His tenant S K Singh said, “The door of the room, in which he was sleeping at the time of the incident, was completely damaged. Even iron grills in the balcony were uprooted and the wall collapsed causing damage to other household articles in the flat.”

However, the local residents gathered there were not ready to buy the police theory of LPG cylinder leakage. “Police officials are hiding the fact and trying to give it a different colour. Many buildings in the neighbourhood felt the tremor caused due to explosion and windowpanes were damaged,” said a local resident Ganga Prasad.

Another building in the same locality was earlier damaged in a similar explosion a few months ago.

Nagpur: “Budget 2020 has given taxpayers an option to continue with the existing tax regime or opt for the new proposed tax regime. Assessees today are confused as to which regime they should really opt for. While under the old tax regime, individuals can continue paying taxes as they had been doing till now. Under the new regime, they will be liable to pay lower taxes if they forego the deductions and exemptions available under the old system. One has to choose wisely after taking all factors into consideration as to which tax regime has to be chosen,” said chartered accountant Julfesh Shah.

He was speaking at a programme — Critical Analysis of Budget 2020 organized by Chamber of Small Industry Associations (COSIA) in Nagpur.

The exemptions that taxpayers will have to forego if they opt for the new regime are — standard deduction of Rs. 50,000 for the salaried, house rent allowance for individuals staying in rented accommodation, interest towards housing loan for self-occupied property, leave travel allowance twice in blocks of four years. The most commonly claimed deduction under section 80C towards provident fund contribution, life insurance premium, school tuition fee, ELSS, PPF will also have to be forgone, explained Shah.

439,['11/02/2020'],Bail-seekers to pay Rs 7.5k each to engage workers for govt home,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Madurai: Granting anticipatory bail to two people, who were apprehending arrest in a case registered against them for illegal sand mining, the Madras high court has directed them to pay Rs 7,500 each to engage two sanitary workers for the government observation home at Madurai after taking cognizance of the fact that the home lacked cleanliness.

Justice G R Swaminathan passed the order while hearing the anticipatory bail plea of Karthik and Senthil. After the petitioners’ counsel informed the court that they were first time offenders and they were willing to abide by any condition imposed by the court, the judge granted bail to the petitioners.

The judge observed, “I would have directed the petitioners to deposit a sum of Rs 7,500 each to the concerned District Mineral Foundation Trust. But, I consciously decided to make a departure and direct the petitioners to deposit a sum of Rs 7,500 each to the credit of the observation home at Madurai.”

Explaining about the reason for giving such a direction, the judge noted that after the Supreme Court had mandated that the implementation of the Juvenile Justice Act must be monitored by the respective high courts, a committee was constituted by the Chief Justice of this court. Justice Swaminathan, who was part of the committee headed by Justice T Raja inspected the government observation home at Madurai recently and noticed that the premises lacked cleanliness.

When the committee inquired in this regard, the superintendent of the home informed that due to lack sanitary workers’ posts, they have outsourced the work to two people who would clean the premises once in 15 days. The superintendent also mentioned that they would require Rs 16,000 per month to engage two full time sanitary workers. The judge observed that by this arrangement and directing the petitioners in similar cases to pay the sum to the observation home, a total of Rs 5.76lakh could be raised in three years which would be sufficient to engage two full time sanitary workers. “Hope the state government would sanction two posts of sweepers in the meanwhile,” observed the judge.

Justice Swaminathan also observed that the jurisdictional magistrate/ chairperson of Juvenile Justice Board shall monitor the attendance and work of the sanitary workers and should send a certificate indicating their attendance, standard of work and salary received by the workers to the registrar (judicial) of the court every month.

More than 10 days after World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a ‘Public Health Emergency of International Concern’ on January 30, around two dozen suspected people have been tested for the deadly virus in MP. It includes people from Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior, Mandsaur, Jabalpur and Khargone.

For the past four days, MP health department task force to deal with virus spread has on-record decreased the suspected samples sent for testing to NIV Pune. Health department officials neither confirmed nor denied if any more test samples were sent to NIV Pune on Monday.

One-third of health department officials at the front line of surveillance and control of diseases like Coronavirus, Zika, H1N1 have missed their scheduled training for the second time. A health department circular identified 11 epidemiologists who did not attend the training programme in Bhopal.

Epidemiology is the area of healthcare that deals with the incidence, distribution, and possible control of diseases, illnesses and other factors. The epidemiologists are from Betul, Agar-Malwa, Mandsaur, Rewa, Shahjapur, Chhindwara, Panna, Harda, Sidhi, Annuppur and Ratlam. The training under Ayushman Bharat for district nodal officer (Epidemiologist) was scheduled for January 17 and 20.

Earlier in 2014, a health department proposal inviting doctors to apply for a two-year post doctoral training — India Epidemic Intelligence Service Programme (EIS) — was missed by many in the health department.

Thiruvananthapuram: The state assembly on Monday witnessed heated arguments between the ruling and the opposition members on the ‘ crisis in the farming sector in the state’ before the latter staged a walkout, alleging that the LDF government was making hollow promises instead of helping farmers ‘who were on the verge of committing suicide’.

Though speaker P Sreeramakrishnan, after nod from agriculture minister V S Sunilkumar, allowed discussion on an adjournment motion moved by Congress MLA Sunny Joseph. The rare gesture of treasury benches accepting notice for adjournment motion couldn’t prevent the usual walkout by the opposition.

The intention of the treasury bench was clear from the beginning of the discussion — to corner Congress for the Asean agreement India signed in August 2009, during the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government, which according to them triggered the crisis in the agriculture sector.

“After cheating the rubber farmers to help tyre companies, the UDF and the Congress is now shedding crocodile tears for them,” said Sunilkumar, concluding the discussions, and his remarks triggered a commotion which went on for a few minutes. The minister also urged the UDF to join the LDF in opposing and defeating the move to import dairy and other agricultural produces from the US, a matter under consideration in the ongoing Indo-US discussions.

“The Kerala government is doing nothing for the farmers who are in deep financial crisis and the number of farmer suicides under the LDF tenure now stands at 22,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, while leading the walkout after the speaker rejected the resolution. But the minister retorted that the number of farmers who committed suicide during the previous government’s tenure was 69.

UDF members including K C Joseph, P J Joseph, Anoop Jacob and Shafi Parambil alleged that farmers were not the priority of the state government, ‘which was evident in the hollow promises and low plan fund expenditure’. CPM MLA Raju Abraham hit back, demanding the UDF to apologize to farmers for all the global agreements signed and wrong polices, ‘which now the BJP-led government is following in a more aggressive manner’.

Taking part in the discussions, former minister Mullakkara Ratnakaran stressed the need for a central debt relief act, ‘a long-pending demand’, while Congress MLA Shafi Parambil demanded waving off all agricultural loans to prevent farmer suicides.

Dismissing allegations that the government remained insensitive to farmers’ issues, as P J Joseph tried to convey through an old Malayalam film song ‘Kannu thurakkatha daivangale...’, the minister said that the farming sector was witnessing a speedy revival under the LDF government.

The other officers put under suspension are Birendra Kumar Tarun (executive officer, Bankipur circle of Patna Municipal Corporation), Poonam Kumari, (then EO of Kankarbagh circle, PMC) Shailesh Kumar (EO, new capital circle, PMC), Bhawani Nandan, (then chief engineer), Om Prakash Singh (superintending engineer), Suryakant (superintending engineer in-charge), Sanjiv Choudhary and Yogendra Kumar (both executive engineers), Ram Chandra Prasad (SE-HQ), Santosh Kumar (then executive engineer), Daya Shankar Prasad (EE), Sudarshan Prasad (EE-Mechanical), Anil Kumar Mahto and Vijay Singh (both junior engineers) in BUIDCO.

Besides suspension, the government would also initiate departmental proceedings against all these 15 officers.

The action against them were taken on the basis of findings of the high-level committee headed by development commissioner Arun Kumar Singh.

The then PMC commissioner Anupam Kumar Suman (an officer of Indian Revenue Service) was also found negligent in his duty by the high-level committee. Since Suman has now returned to his parent cadre-controlling department under the Union Ministry of Finance, the state government also decided to write a letter to the Union ministry concerned for taking “appropriate action” against Suman on the basis of findings of the high-level committee.

Earlier in October last year, the state government had removed Urban Development and Housing Department’s principal secretary Chaitanya Prasad and Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor from their positions in the wake of prolonged waterlogging. Then BUIDCO MD Singh was shifted to Bihar State Road Transport Corporation as administrator.

445,['11/02/2020'],Data of school students being sold for Rs 2-5 per head,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Representative Image

NAGPUR: Getting access to lakhs of names, contact numbers of school students and their parents apart from the financial status is apparently an extremely easy and cheap exercise. By paying merely Rs 2 to Rs 5, private firms are buying the data from school employees and using it to target prospective customers to sell services like coaching facilities, educational loans , insurance etc.

One such buyer confirmed to TOI that this is extremely common in Nagpur and is usually done without the management’s knowledge.

Speaking on the condition of anonymity, he said, “Staffers in the administration department have details of all students in the school. It’s usually in an excel sheet or can be downloaded in an excel sheet from the proprietary software.” The price paid for the data depends on the school in question. “Depending on the school’s reputation and financial strata of students attending that institute etc, data is sold for anywhere between Rs2 to Rs5 per student. And, usually this is sold to multiple buyers.”

With majority of private schools having enrollment of over a thousand, this has become an easy “business proposition”.

Since this buyer had never dealt directly with a principal, there is no evidence of higher-ups being involved. TOI reached out to a few schools to get their views, but all denied the same. One such principal said this does not even make financial sense. “For a school of thousand students, it comes to maximum Rs 5,000. So, even if one’s ethical sense was questionable, the financial part too is not lucrative for any principal or management to get lured,” said the principal.

The security in schools revolves mostly in checking for pilferage of cash or tangible items by staff, hence it is unlikely that theft of such data can ever be detected. A small pen drive is more than sufficient to store the data even though Internet usage is monitored in schools.

SC Kedia, honorary secretary of Unaided Schools Forum, said, “This is a serious issue and schools must ensure that no infringement of privacy happens in their institutes.”

Lawyer Mahendra Limaye, who recently did his doctorate in the field of cyber law, said theft of such data attracts provisions of Information & Technology Act. “The data is being stolen in electronic mode and calls to prospective customers are also being done through a tech device, hence the law is applicable. Parents should question all callers from coaching classes or policy agents about where they got the data from. File a complaint and it can be traced back to the original source,” said Limaye.

NAGPUR: RB Goenka , the director of MSEB Holding Company Limited (MSEBHCL), has resigned slamming the power officials and charging them with ignoring most of the resolutions passed.

In his resignation letter (dated January 29) addressed to principal secretary (energy), Goenka stated, “On a number of issues raised by me and directions issued by MSEBHCL, the subsidiary companies (MSEDCL, Mahatransco and Mahagenco) did not follow the directions.”

Citing the issues, Goenka stated that one of them was taking prior approval for tariff petitions before filing with Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC). MSEBHCL resolved that any petition or appeal relating with or affecting consumers’ tariff may be submitted to the Board of MSEBHCL for information. In spite of the above resolutions and directives, all the three subsidiary companies filed tariff petitions to MERC without any discussions in MSEBHCL.

Goenka pointed out that two tariff hike petitions were filed by MSEDCL after discussion in MSEBHCL and suggestions were given by the directors which were implemented and the tariff was within control. But the last tariff petition was filed with MERC and post facto approval was asked from MSEBHCL without any discussions on the tariff.

MERC allowed an increase of Rs8268 crores only in ARR in spite of the fact that MSEDCL has requested for a huge deficit of Rs. 34,646 crores.

The power expert further stated that he had many suggestions for rationalization of tariff but they were not discussed at all. “I suggested in the past meeting that special MSEBHCL board meeting should be called for discussing the tariff and amended petition be filed with MERC by incorporating suggestions of board of directors of MSEBHCL,” he added.

MSEDCL suppressed the facts in the case of converting consumer tariff from continuous to non-continuous in which there was a loss of revenue to the tune of more than 800 crores. This issue was regularly raised by Goenka for three years. “MSEDCL did not submit a proper reply and did not fill up the format issued by me as per directives of MSEBHCL,” he said.

The holding company board had resolved that the report of the committee formed by the board of directors in relation to the conversion of MSEDCL’s consumers’ tariff from HT continuous to HT non-continuous be submitted to the Government of Maharashtra. However, MSEDCL did not comply with this directive.

The Board had also directed to examine feasibility of creating a dedicated position in the Holding Company for regular monitoring of the pendency of court cases and for submission of a periodic action taken report to the Board. Even after this resolution was passed, MSEDCL filed a tariff review petition with MERC on the issue of approving non continuous tariff to some selected consumers and MERC did not allow about Rs. 180 crore in annual revenue requirement (ARR) to MSEDCL because of such illegal change of tariff category.

Goenka had also pointed out in the Board meetings that compliance of order issued by consumer grievance redressal forums (CGRFs) and ombudsman were kept pending. He had demanded that a time frame should be fixed for completion of infrastructure projects of power companies.

According to the power expert, decentralization of power and restructuring of MSEDCL in four regions had not provided any benefit since the regional directors were powerless and powers are centralized at the head office only.

447,['11/02/2020'],PWD min: Will accept SC verdict,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: PWD minister G Sudhakaran told the assembly on Monday that the state government will accept whatever verdict the Supreme Court might issue on conducting a load test on the Palarivattom flyover .

The state government had earned a stay order from the apex court last Friday against the Kerala high court’s interim order directing the government to conduct a load test on the Palarivattom flyover to determine its structural stability and load-bearing capacity before demolition.

“The government will accept the SC verdict and will not go for an appeal even if the court directs to carry out the load test,” the minister said, while replying to a submission by senior Congress MLA P T Thomas demanding a speedy opening of the flyover ‘to solve the severe traffic congestion in Ernakulam town’.

Thomas, in his submission, demanded the LDF government not to delay the load test, ‘eyeing the forthcoming elections’. “The government’s stand against the load test has created suspicion about the argument that the flyover lacks structural stability,” he said.

The minister, meanwhile, said the court cases were delaying the demolition and reconstruction of the flyover.

The government had opposed the load test as demanded by the associations of contractors and engineers. They had argued that it was the government’s discretion to decide on such a load test, and had cited expert opinions that such a test would serve no purpose at this juncture as the flyover was already in a distressed condition.

448,['11/02/2020'],"No lobbying for top posts, CM’s decision final, says govt","This story is from February 11, 2020

Bhopal: The Madhya Pradesh government on Monday rejected reports of intense lobbying among IPS officers for the posts of director general of police (DGP) or chief secretary, amid speculation that the incumbent DGP V K Singh may be shifted. Chief secretary S R Mohanty retires on March 31.

The government’s denial came a day after special DG-police reforms Maithili Sharan Gupta took the unprecedented step of pitching himself publicly for the post of DGP. Gupta, an officer of the 1984 batch, is on the UPSC list among three other top cops that the state government has rejected. In a social media message on Sunday, Gupta claimed that he has the capacity to turn around policing in the state, taking the government by surprise.

The state government rejected Gupta’s claims and asked him to follow procedure. “Maithili Sharan Gupta is a senior police officer and he knows the appointment procedure. In case of appointments of DGP or chief secretary, the chief minister takes the final decision after administrative procedure are followed,” said public relations minister P C Sharma.

“One cannot stake claim to a post on the basis of assumptions. The chief minister has the prerogative to assess officers as per their performance. He can take a decision after procedural exercise. In all such cases, the chief minister takes the decision according to requirement and time for the best results. If necessary, he can effect changes any time, but at this time there is no such process going on,” the minister added.

Controversy over DGP’s post erupted on February 8 after the MP government rejected the UPSC panel that had the names of incumbent DGP V K Singh, BSF DG Vivek Kumar Johri and Maithili Sharan Gupta. The government argued that the ‘willingness’ of Johri had not been taken in writing. The next day, DGP V K Singh had a lengthy closed-door meeting with chief minister Kamal Nath.

A day after that, speculation grew that the government would decide a name for DGP and chief secretary. On Monday, minister Sharma did not comment on any imminent change in the administration.

Gupta’s social media post, which went viral on Sunday, said: “I feel others (esteemed journalists and good public personalities) should come forward to convey my point of view and potential to make a difference in delivery to public and transforming police as real saviour and helper. I would not like to project myself as victim or aggrieved. Government should realise I have the capacity to turn around policing in the state.”

Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan called this a sign of “chaos in the MP administration”. “Officials themselves are demanding that they need such a post. It’s a mockery of the state,” Chouhan tweeted.

449,['11/02/2020'],SC seeks response from governments on infant’s death at Shaheen Bagh,"This story is from February 11, 2020

MAKING A POINT: Whether a child was called Pakistani in school was not related at all to the issue of an infan... Read More

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday sought responses from the Centre and Delhi government after taking cognizance of a letter from a 12-year-old bravery award winner who sought to prevent infants and children from being taken to protests citing the death of a four-month-old at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi.

Immediately after a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant took cognizance of Mumbai student Zen Gunratan Sadavarte ’s letter, a large number of advocates representing some women protesters at Shaheen Bagh said under the UN Convention of Child Rights, children had a right to protest.

One advocate, representing three such protesters, said their children faced a tough time as they were being called “Pakistani” in schools. Another went on to claim the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens had resulted in detention of many children, which also violated their rights. Yet another said even Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg was a minor and had been protesting against global warming.

Taken aback by women advocates vociferously pitching against scrutiny of an important issue — whether children and infants could be part of agitations and protests — CJI Bobde said, “We do not want people to use this platform (Supreme Court) to create more problems. Whether a child was called Pakistani in school is not related at all to the issue here.”

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta asked, “Can that be a ground to take a four-month-old child to the protest site?” Referring to the argument that children had a right to protest, the CJI asked, “Did that four-month-old child go to the protest site? Mothers should support this scrutiny.”

This did not deter women counsel from raising CAA and NRC issues, the mainstay of the nearly two-month-long protests at Shaheen Bagh. The CJI did not buy the arguments and said, We will stop those from arguing in the court if they raise such irrelevant issues. We have highest regard for motherhood and societal peace. But do not make general arguments. We are only considering the death of the child and the issue of stopping children and infants being taken to protest sites.”

A woman lawyer came to the defence of the couple who had taken the infant to the protest site regularly despite the extreme cold weather which eventually led to the baby’s death. “The child’s mother lived in a place which cannot be called home. It is an enclosure made of mere plastic sheets,” she said.

Sadavarte’s mother said she had researched the issue and would like to place it before the court. The bench remained firm on dealing only with the issue at hand and said, “We are not stifling anyone, but do not disturb the proceedings by making irrelevant arguments.”

RAMPUR: A resident of Kheda Tanda village in Rampur was arrested for allegedly setting his wife afire after giving her triple talaq for not meeting his dowry demands.

The woman, who suffered 75% burn injuries, was admitted to the trauma centre of Teerthanker Mahaveer Medical College in Moradabad, where she is stated to be critical.

The woman’s father in his complaint alleged, “My son-in-law first pronounced talaq thrice to my daughter and then set her afire as I could not fulfil his demand of a car.”

According to police, the couple got married two years ago and have a one-year-old daughter.

Speaking with TOI, Azeemnagar police station SHO Amrish Kumar said, “The woman’s statement has been recorded. We are investigating the matter after registering an FIR against her husband and his relatives under sections 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and under relevant sections of the Dowry Prohibition Act and the Muslim Women Protection Act.”

451,['11/02/2020'],Maharashtra: Slow traffic flow at Satara toll plazas despite FASTag,"PUNE: The rollout of FASTag across the country from December 15 last year has failed to streamline traffic and reduce travel time on the Pune-Satara highway.Long queues of vehicles can be seen on both flanks of the road at the two toll plazas on the stretch — Khed Shivapur and Anewadi. The introduction of 10 toll collection lanes on each side at Khed Shivapur toll plaza has also failed in streamlining traffic movement. Regular commuters claimed that it takes nearly 20 minutes to cross the Khed Shivapur toll plaza at any time of the day.Pavanjit Mane, a Satara resident working in Pune, said, “Cash and FASTag lanes have not been marked clearly on the toll nakas, which creates confusion. Vehicles enter any lanes, slowing down the progress of queues. Many drivers get into arguments with the toll plaza attendants over various issues.”Mane said a new argument that sparked off recently was lack of concession for return toll. “Arguments over lack of provision for a lesser return toll increases the wait time at toll plazas.”The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), through a policy circular on January 15, clarified, “In order to promote digital payment, it has been decided that discount for users who make return journey within 24 hours shall be provided only if the toll payments have been made via FASTag. No return journey discount shall be provided to toll payments made in cash or any other mode with effect from January 15.”Mane said no such information was shared by the toll plaza attendants, who stated that they were unaware as to why the concession on return toll was withdrawn.Another Satara resident, Virat Raje Ghadge, who regularly commutes on the stretch, said, “There is no specific cash lane at both the toll plazas between Satara and Pune. According to the rules, 25% of the toll gates must be cash or hybrid lanes. But the toll attendants accept cash in all the lanes. They are also not charging double toll for vehicles that don’t have FASTag. The management at the toll plazas, especially at Khed Shivapur, is bad,” he said.Pune resident Yash Jalan, who recently travelled to Kolhapur , said, “The situation at Khed Shivapur and Anewadi is quite chaotic. The authorities have made 10 toll gates for vehicles commuting in either direction, which leads to chaos. The situation is a complete contrast at the two toll plazas between Satara and Kolhapur. Cash and hybrid lanes have been marked and only vehicles with FASTag are permitted to enter the FASTag or Express lanes. I cannot understand why this cannot be adopted at Anewadi and Khed Shivapur.”An official from the NHAI confirmed that concessions had been withdrawn for those paying toll in cash. B K Singh, the project director for Pune-Satara highway, said, “If those paying by FASTag are also not getting the concession on return fares, there could be a technical glitch in the system. We are also working on easing the chaos at the toll plazas.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74071137,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39310,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/slow-traffic-flow-at-satara-toll-plazas-despite-fastag/articleshow/74071136.cms

NAGPUR: Having assumed charge as municipal commissioner 14 days ago, Tukaram Mundhe is yet to meet mayor Sandip Joshi . Mundhe did not find time to meet Joshi even after the latter sent notices thrice for a meeting to finalize shifting of private travel operators outside city limits. The word in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) corridors is that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is virtually taking control of the BJP-led NMC.

On Monday, chief secretary Ajoy Mehta held a meeting to review NMC’s working. Earlier, the state government, including chief secretaries, used to hold meetings of NMC or any other urban local bodies for review of projects etc. This is probably the first time the top state officer is reviewing NMC’s working.

Mundhe along with deputy commissioner Rajesh Mohite, chief engineer Ulhas Debadwar, and superintending engineers Manoj Talewar and Shweta Banerjee were present. None of the NMC office bearers, including mayor or corporators or local legislators were invited for the meeting. Even the three ministers from the district were not present. All officials were tight-lipped about the meeting.

Sources from Mantralaya and NMC said Mehta has never convened a meeting to review working of other municipal corporations.

The government, all of a sudden, replaced Abhijit Bangar with Mundhe despite the former having completed only 14 months, and an IAS official’s tenure here considered as minimum 36 months. Mundhe assumed charge on January 28.

As per protocol and common practice, the civic chief meets the mayor immediately after joining. In the last 14 days, Mundhe and Joshi have not met each other or even held any joint meeting with officials or corporators.

Joshi said, “Mundhe might be busy so could not meet me. I hope he will meet me soon so that we can plan and take forward the development of city.”

Joshi pointed he was not in city from January 28 to 31 while Mundhe left for Mumbai on February 1 for meetings. “We both were in NMC for only two days over last 14 days. Now, he is again at Mumbai for last couple of days for meetings,” he said.

Joshi said, “The plan to develop infrastructure and shift private travels buses out is a very crucial issue. I have sent notices three times to Mundhe but he seems to be busy. I hope he gives time between February 11 and 14, so the policy can be finalized.”

Joshi held a general body meeting on February 4 to discuss Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) issues but it was postponed due to Mundhe’s absence. Then, Joshi postponed the meeting to February 20. On Monday, Joshi preponed the meeting to February 13.

Mundhe said, “Our meeting will happen soon and there should be no miscommunication. I called the mayor right on the first day and discussed two issues. I could not meet Joshi as we were not at NMC on same days. Joshi was busy with his janata durbar on the two days we both were present at NMC. I am here to ensure Nagpur’s development and ensure availability of all types of civic amenities to the people. My job is to work for Nagpur,” he said.

Despite the mayor’s ongoing janata durbar, Mundhe has launched his own campaign to meet people and resolve some issues. He also held a series of meetings with officials.

Sources also said Mundhe did not attend meetings of standing committee, consultative committees etc. “Mundhe also directed additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi not to attend meetings of consultative committees, and instead send deputy commissioners etc,” said sources.

Earlier, MVA cabinet had constituted a committee of ministers to execute and monitor Nag River Pollution Abatement Project despite NMC being the nodal agency. None of the BJP legislators, leaders or office bearers in NMC are in the committee.

On Monday, Mundhe and his team gave a presentation on NMC’s financial condition for decision on 7th Pay Commission to employees at urban development department, which will take a final decision soon.

The duo was detained while trying to board a Malaysia-bound flight on Saturday. Akel Barua Roy Tanmoy, 28, of Lohagara and Tiul Barua Das Arnab, 21, told police they had come to India in October 2019 by sneaking in through the West Bengal border. Catching a train from Kolkata, they arrived in Bengaluru later.

“In Bengaluru, the duo approached an agent who helped them get an Indian passport with fake documents. In December 2019, they went to Nagpur and became monks. Stating they were visiting Malaysia for spiritual purposes, they got visa,” police said. “The address and other details in the passports were not clear. When questioned about their citizenship, they failed to provide proper answers,” sources said.

The duo has been sent to Central Jail, Bengaluru.

Nainital: For decades, tourists from across India and even abroad would visit Nainital to buy its famous locally-made scented candles. However, in the past few years, the market has been on a downslide. Traders and shopkeepers say that till a few years ago, there were over 60 to 70 candle shops in Nainital but now there are barely a dozen of them left and even they are moving to other businesses.

“People have started taking to other businesses and the shops that used to only manufacture and sell candles have taken to other gift items as well,” said Amit Virmani, a candle manufacturer and one of the oldest traders in the town.

Virmani said that his father had started the business in Nainital in the 1960s, adding that the trade which was booming till a decade ago has almost collapsed now. “There was a time when even tourists from foreign countries would come to Nainital in search of candles, However, now even the locals are not interested in them,” he added.

The candle business in Nainital has supported hundreds of people and dozens of families who settled in the lake town after the British left. Over the years, the entire Mall Road and the Bara Bazaar area were lined with dozens of shops selling aromatic candles.

Gaurav, another manufacturer of the aromatic candles, said that there are barely half a dozen manufacturers left in the business now. “Earlier, I used to have 15 workers working for me but now I am left with only six because the demand has decreased,” he said.

Those in the candle business put the blame of the falling demand on the abundance of Chinese candles in the market. “There are some tourists who demand the locally-made candles, but many just need a souvenir and they are content with buying cheap alternatives. Therefore, they prefer the Chinese candles which barely cost Rs 100 while the locally-made ones range between Rs 250 and Rs 10,000,” Gaurav said.

Virmani added that excessive taxation under GST on the candles has resulted in the increased prices and therefore the government should revise the rates. “Before GST, there was no tax on handmade candles, but now it’s as high as 12%. The government should revise the GST rate and bring it down to around 5% so that the local businesses can be saved from dying.”

NAGPUR: Cases of honour killings are reported often. From Gadchiroli, a case of honour suicides has come to fore. A couple and their son killed themselves by jumping into a well at their farm in Anand Nagar of Semana-Navegaon locality in Gadchiroli on Monday because their daughter had eloped with her lover.

The daughter and her newly wed husband too jumped into a river after consuming poison after hearing of tragic end of her family but both were rescued by cops and are being treated at the Gadchiroli’s civil hospital.

Ravindra Wargantiwar, 56, his wife Vaishali, 47 took the drastic decision to end their lives along with their son Sairam, 19. Police sources stated that Wargantiwars were devastated when daughter got married on Friday. Having eloped, the two had tied knot at Markanda temple and were staying together. It is learnt the family was were vehemently opposed to the marriage as their daughter’s boyfriend was from another caste.

The newly wed couple are learnt to have recorded their decision to end life in an audio clip before sending it to their friends, families and also in social media groups. The message also reached cops from Gadchiroli town who started looking for them.

Gadchiroli SP Shailesh Balkawade said police started collecting information about the couple in order to prevent their suicide. “Two of our constables risked their life by jumping into the river near Chamorshi and dragging out the couple from the water. They were rushed to the Civil hospital. Our primary concern is now to save their life,” said the SP.

Photo fore representative purpose only

NEW DELHI: Eleven students of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication on Monday were served a show-cause notice and placed under suspension for five days for “concerted acts of indiscipline” within the IIMC campus.

The protests, a public talk on affordable education, were held on IIMC campus despite repeated counselling by the administration and faculty members. The February 10 order gave time to the 11 students until 5pm on Tuesday to explain why “further disciplinary action” should not be taken against them for violating the code of conduct for students. On humanitarian grounds, however, the order said suspended students would not be asked to vacate their hostel rooms.

Protest against hostel fee hike on the neighbouring JNU campus spread to IIMC in December last year, when students protested against the “unaffordable fee structure”. Some IIMC students also staged a strike on campus against the high tuition fee and hostel and mess charges.

Malappuram: Demanding the repeal of CAA , a local unit of Ayyappa Dharma Sena ( ADS ) organized hunger strike in Changaramkulam in the district on Monday.

Former state president of the organization Rahul Easwar inaugurated the hunger strike organized by Sunil Valayamkulam, a local leader of the organization. Earlier, the Khateeb of Changaramkulam Juma Masjid handed over national flag to Sunil prior to beginning of the one-day-long hunger strike at 10am.

After Rahul announced the hunger strike two days ago, Ayyappa Dharma Sena trustee board had clarified that the ADS had no link with the protest to be held at Changaramkulam. The board meeting held at Thrissur had also decided to remove Rahul from the post of state president of the organsiation. However, the programme was held at Changaramkulam under the local unit of Ayyappa Dharma Sena.

While inaugurating the protest, Rahul said the CAA will divide people based on religion and the protest is being organized to express solidarity with Muslims who have raised serious concern over the implementation of the act.

Rahul said he is sticking to his earlier stand that Indian Muslims are more important than Hindus in Pakistan. “We should respect each other irrespective of religion. Our country upholds the philosophy of secularism and we cannot divide people on the basis of religion,” he said.

Rahul welcomed the SC decision to refer questions of law in Sabarimala case to a larger bench. Rahul said the hearing by larger bench will give a clarity on issues related to freedom of religion under the Constitution and faith.

Pune: A timely response to an alert relayed by the police control room foiled an attempted heist at an ATM of a nationalised bank in Yeolewadi in the early hours of Sunday.

The Kondhwa police had received a call from the control room around 2.50am in this regard. The call specified that some men were in the process of stealing money from the cash dispensing unit of an unmanned ATM kiosk at Digamber House near Sinhagad College.

Responding to the alert, a night patrol police team from the nearby Khadi Machine chowkey rushed to the spot and nabbed the two men inside the ATM kiosk.

The bank’s Kondhwa branch manager, Rakesh Nagendranath Sahay, was informed of the attempted theft at 10am on Monday, following which he filed an FIR with the Kondhwa police.

“The duo — Shriram Vikas Hanvate (26) and Rameshwar Baliram Deshmukh (24) — are from Parali taluka of Beed district. While Hanvate is a criminal on the records of Pimpri Chinchwad police, Deshmukh has no criminal history,” the FIR stated.

“By the time the night patrol team reached the spot, the duo had managed to remove the cash box’s cover, snapped the cash dispensing unit wire and damaged the smoke alarm installed inside the kiosk. They, however, failed to steal the cash,” the FIR further read.

The branch manager said the police had recovered a grinder machine, screwdriver, crowbar, wire cutter, spanner, hacksaw and a motorcycle from the possession of Hanvate and Deshmukh.

“The ATM unit did not have an armed security guard or an emergency alarm. A CCTV camera installed in the kiosk captured the images of the duo, while they were breaking the cash dispensing unit. Investigations revealed that Hanvate and Deshumukh targeted the machine as they were well-versed with the area. Hanvate had earlier worked for a private firm in Khadi Machine Chowk,” said assistant inspector Chetan More from the Kondhwa police.

Sub-inspector and investigating officer Santosh Shinde said the duo decided to steal cash from the ATM as Hanvate was in dire need of money. “He roped in Deshmukh, who had come to Pune only last week. They decided to break into the kiosk in the wee hours of Sunday to escape detection,” Shinde said.

“We are questioning the duo to find out if they had visited the spot earlier. We are also trying to ascertain if they had sought help from someone else. Investigations are on to establish if they had targeted any ATMs in the city earlier,” Shinde added.

The Pune Cantonment court on Monday sent the duo in police custody remand till February 12.

461,['11/02/2020'],Cops say more CCTVs helped curb chain-snatching incidents in city,"This story is from February 11, 2020

Madurai: The number of chain-snatching incidents in the city, which has gradually witnessed a slowdown over the years, saw a sudden decline in 2019 compared to its previous year. While 132 incidents were reported in 2018, the number dropped to just 66 in 2019, an RTI pettion filed by TOI has revealed.

Police officers attributed it to the increase in CCTV camera installation and increased visible policing for the last couple of years. Recently, city police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham told TOI that all sorts of crime incidents have come down in 2019 due to the increasing number of CCTV cameras being installed by the police, private and commercial establishments. The work taken up by the police to install CCTV installations in all major junctions in each station and providing link to the respective station has been progressing well. More than 12 stations have already been covered and work is underway in the rest, he had said. In 2017, as many as 173 snatching incidents were reported. Since then, the number has been coming down. The quantity of jewellery lost in snatching incidents has also been coming down rapidly. While gold jewellery weighing 6.7kg were lost in 2017, it was 3.6kg in 2018 and 2.4kg in 2019.

However, detection cases and recovery of lost gold jewellery has been a challenge task to the city police. Only 30% of the lost jewellery in 2019 was recovered. A higher official said that they have been working in this area as well.

“We are facing challenge mainly because, most of the snatching cases involved new offenders. When youths with no prior criminal record enters a crime incident suddenly, it becomes hard to detect. Moreover, often stolen bikes are used in such incidents, which makes it hard to trace them using the number plate details,” he said.

462,['11/02/2020'],K Chandrasekhar Rao: Revenue reforms; Telangana government scraps joint collector posts,"This story is from February 11, 2020

K Chandrasekhar Rao

HYDERABAD: After bringing in amendments to the Panchayat Raj Act and Municipalities Act with more responsibilities and accountability to both officials and elected representatives, the Telangana government is gearing up for overhaul of the revenue administration.

Two days before the collectors’ conference, the government transferred 49 cadre and non-cadre officers and created two new additional collector posts in each district. An additional collector would be incharge of local bodies, likely to supervise panchayats and municipalities on day to day basis. “Additional collector will be made incharge for overseeing Palle Pragati and Pattana Pragati programmes,” a senior official said.

Official sources said creation of new additional collector posts was part of revenue reforms, which would be brought in the form of a new revenue legislation. CM K Chandrasekhar Rao has been expressing his unhappiness over present revenue administration, especially land administration issues, and vowed to revamp the revenue system. The government was also mulling either to merge the revenue department with panchayat raj department or transfer some powers to other departments.

The CM might unveil his ideas on revenue reforms and job chart of collectors and additional collectors during collectors’ conference on February 11. As of now, joint collectors take care of revenue, civil supplies and education etc, but joint collector post was being scrapped in district administration set-up.

“Since the government is focussing on transparency in land transactions, where registration and mutation of land should be done immediately, and also ensure corruption-free and hassle-free registration at revenue offices, special provisions are being made in the new revenue legislation. It is likely that the registration and stamps department will become part of revenue administration,” a senior bureaucrat said. He said the exercise on the new revenue law has already begun and might be placed in the Assembly in the upcoming budget session.

Presently, the revenue department was being handled by chief secretary Somesh Kumar. Since he has too much on his hand, the government might appoint a secretary to take care of commercial taxes, revenue and registration and stamps departments, the sources said.

In this direction, government offices in the state will become paper-free very soon. Already, we are conducting paperless cabinet meetings and soon, even the secretariat and governor office will become e-enabled.”

Pointing out that there was immense innovation potential in the state, the CM said, “I have seen a class 7 student make a model of a smart city which has solutions to all civic problems we face in our daily life. This shows that we have young talent in our state and they should not be deterred from pursuing their dreams because of financial difficulties. This is why, we have decided to have special funds to help these young innovators.”

Also present at the inauguration of the Uttarakhand Space Building was former chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) AS Kiran Kumar as well as MPS Bisht, director of Uttarakhand Space Application Centre (USAC) and RK Sudhanshu, secretary, science and technology among others.

He was responding to a calling attention motion by MLA T J Vinod, who pointed out that the government had failed to meet the six-month deadline for getting the central government’s approval for the state’s new CZMP as per the CRZ notification 2019.

Jayarajan said that the government had already entrusted the National Centre for Earth Science Studies to prepare the CZMP, taking into account of the special situation in the state.

Madurai: Farmers from Vellalur in Madurai submitted a petition to the Madurai district collector on Monday, alleging that the procurement centres were charging exorbitant rates for loading their paddy.

The petition submitted by Vellalur branch of the Tamil Nadu Farmers association, stated that paddy was being procured from their village by government-appointed procurement centres.

Last year, the workers at the procurement centre demanded Rs 42 for loading a 41-kilogram bag of paddy.

This was opposed by the farmers. K M Manickam, a farmer, said that last year they had demanded that the loading cost be brought down to Rs 30 and after negotiations it was fixed at Rs 38.

The farmers had hoped that the same would continue this year, but when procurement began on Feb 8, they were asked to pay Rs 47 for a 41-kilogram bag, which was way too expensive.

“It is known that agriculture is no more profitable, and farmers are facing high debts and many of them are being driven to commit suicide. The situation is already bad and now increased in the procurement cost has made things worse for us,’’ he said.

He said that the price should be fixed at Rs 30 and that the district administration should take the initiative for the same.

Thiruvananthapuram: Closely sticking to the age-old practice, members in the opposition and treasury benches shared their diametrically opposite views on the state budget presented by finance minister T M Thomas Issac on Monday, the first day of the general discussion on the budget for financial year 2020-2021 .

Members from the treasury benches found the budget a bold attempt which, according to them, showed how adept the finance minister was in devising alternative development plans and proposals at a time when the country was on the brink of recession. “The budget presented by Isaac adopts a proactive approach towards development. The proposals he made in the budget for the development of Wayanad would help the district to scale up new heights of sustainable development. It sends a strong message of alternative development,” he said.

However, Congress MLA V D Satheesan, who opened the discussion at the opposition end, said the budget underscored the ‘far right turn’ of the Left government. By undermining the plan process, Isaac was following the far right policies of the BJP government, he said. He accused the minister for reducing the plan outlay by Rs 3,000 crore, which he said was unprecedented. “Like the BJP government in the Centre, you too are proving to be more interested in projects than plans,” he said.

He said the Wayanad and Idukki packages were mere repetition of what Isaac had announced in his last budget. Satheesan said that there was no truth in the arguments that Isaac has set aside Rs 6,000 crore for the development of Kochi.

“The new projects offered to Kochi was worth just Rs 2.5 crore,” he said. He also questioned the rationale behind Isaac choosing to tax the ailing real estate and automobile sectors.
