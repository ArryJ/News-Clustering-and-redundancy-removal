The film will now be screened at the United National headquarters on World Wildlife Day , which is on March 3. Directed by Amoghavarsha JS and Kalyan Varma, Ricky Kej has worked on the music. Sir David Attenborough ’s commentary is one of the highlights of this film which also saw a one-of-its-kind theatrical release.“The UN Environment Programme is being kind enough to host this event, where they will screen our film and also have a panel discussion with Amoghavarsha and me,” says Ricky, who is an ambassador for various UN organisations working for the environment.Ricky adds that the show will not just have some of the big delegates from the UN, but there will be space for a few lucky members of the public who will get to experience being in the headquarters.Wild Karnataka captures the rich bio-diversity of Karnataka, especially in the Western Ghats , wherein a bunch of wildlife lensmen led by Amoghavarsha and Kalyan Varma have recorded rare animal behaviours.

1,['26/02/2020'],Upendra's dance inspires name for a species of dancing frogs,"We often hear of fans idolising film stars so much that they tend to name their children after them. Illustrator Rohan Chakravarty and researcher and scholar Madhushri Mudke, have named a rare species of dancing frogs Kappendra — after Kannada’s Real star Upendra . Find out why…The endangered species of dancing frogs — commonly known as the Kottigehar Dancing Frogs are also referred to as the true Kannadigas, owing to the fact that they are found only along the Western Ghats within Karnataka . “The species is endemic to the Western Ghats in our state and is found in primary streams and Myristica swamps (a type of freshwater swamp forest which are only found along the Western Ghats),” explains Madhushri. Since the species is now on the brink of extinction, Madhushri and her team have been studying the species and their habitats for over a year to understand how they can be protected.When illustrator Rohan, who was roped in to create posters to spread awareness of this species, spent time observing the species, he was reminded of a song from one of Upendra’s films — MTV Subbalakshmi ge. “These are a species of frogs that grow and live exclusively in Karnataka. They are also dancing frogs — and the only star that one can think of as far as great dance moves are concerned, is Upendra. The name Kappendra was therefore inspired by Upendra’s moves in that song. Though, he is not aware that we were inspired by him at all,” explains Rohan.This particular species of frogs live in areas with high background music (created from flowing water). They use visual signalling which involves alternate movements of their hind limbs to attract mates and show their presence in a particular territory, and in doing so, they look like they are dancing.EDGE species refers to animals that are Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (hence EDGE). And, sadly this beautiful amphibian is now an edge species. ""They do require a special habitat for breeding. And, One of the requirements for this amphibian is that it requires canopy cover and if there is no canopy cover, then with direct sunlight falling on the swamps might disturb their habitat. And, not just that temperature rise, polluted water streams, human disturbance affect their habitats and you cannot find them in such places. These are the reasons why we can't see them along the Ghats that much as they prefer less disturbed habitats."" On being asked whether global warming is one of the reasons for the shrinking numbers, she adds, ""To understand the impact of global warming on any species, we need years of study and data which we do not have in this case. But, yes globally, there is a decline in the amphibian population because of Global Warming.""Name of the species: Micrixalus KottigeharensisWhere they are found: Along the Western GhatsUnique trait: Their croak is rather feeble, so they depend on visual signalling which is also calledfoot-flagging— Inputs from Madhushri MudkeIn 2014, a team of researchers studied the diversity of frogs that belonged to the Micrixalidae family. They found 24 species of dancing frogs along the Western Ghats alone. The size of these dancing frogs (males) ranged from 1.46 to 2.88cm; with the Sali’s Dancing Frog being the smallest and the Kalakkad Dancing Frog being the largest. The Kottigehar Dancing Frog is among the larger members of this family, with the male measuring around 2.29cm.— Study done by Biju et al",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74300913,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1026852/74300913.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/upendras-dance-inspires-name-for-a-species-of-dancing-frogs/articleshow/74300901.cms

4,['26/02/2020'],When Bengaluru was treated to an evening of Indo-Korean music,"This story is from February 26, 2020

In a day and age when Gen Now is lapping up all things Korean, be it pop music, beauty products and trends, TV dramas, cinema, etc., it comes as no surprise that the city played host to a performance that was a mix of Indian classical music, traditional Korean music and contemporary dance. Called Same Same But Different , the event was organised by the InKo Centre, as part of their annual Indo-Korean performance series that attempts to put the spotlight on their cultural diversity. The title of the performance, for instance, was meant to denote the similarities between Indian and Korean cultures, especially in music.

This time around, they had Korean new wave music group Noreum Machi, Indian classical ensemble Trayam (consisting of vocalist and flautist Varijashree Venugopal , percussionists Manjunath and Praveen D Rao) and Padma Shri awardee and dancer-choreographer Astad Deboo.

“When the idea of this collaboration was pitched to me, I found the combination of music very interesting. The amalgamation of the beats is so unique and different that I knew that I wanted to contribute to this collaboration,” says Astad.

When asked about her experience of working with such a diverse group of artistes, Varijashree says, “The process was enriching and educational. We had performed together last year as well. We got to learn a lot about Korean culture and music through this performance and I was very impressed with the way we brought our music together. Korean music includes a wide range of instruments, some being slightly similar to ours, my personal favourite being piri, which sounds a little like the shenai. Teaching each other the little intricacies of our music was what made this performance really special.”

5,['26/02/2020'],TV show Jothe Jotheyalli inspires viewers to segregate waste,"The makers of the Kannada TV show Jothe Jotheyalli are setting an example of sorts. A twist in the tale, which is based on the love story of a 20-year-old girl Anu ( Megha Shetty ) and 45-year-old businessman Aryavardhan (Aniruddha Jatkar), touched upon the relevance of segregating waste at source to tackle the growing garbage menace in urban areas. What’s interesting to note is that watching this on air has had its impact on its viewers — as people across Karnataka have apparently adopted the practice. Confirming the same was a message from Mythri, an environmental engineer at the Mysuru City Corporation , to the lead actor of the show – Aniruddha . The corporation informed that the number of people who were mixing dry and wet waste has reduced by 20% ever since the show created awareness on waste segregation and management. Jagadish Arooru, the director of the TV show, tells us, “Every day, a huge quantum of waste is being generated, but there is no place to dump this. It is carried to landfills, where they segregate the waste, and that is a herculean task. Despite waste segregation at source being made mandatory, very few have actually been doing it. So we thought we should do our bit by including the idea of waste segregation as part of our show, which has proved fruitful.”The director adds that the TV show will also shed more light on the ways of making money from waste. “In the coming episodes, we will show how waste can be treated as manure, and, therefore, does not have to be disposed outside,” says the director.Buoyed by the response from the people, lead actor Aniruddha says, “We are glad that our show is changing the way people think about throwing garbage. TV shows are not just about entertainment alone, they can also be used as a tool to bring in change.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74300831,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-110393/74300831.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/kannada/tv-show-jothe-jotheyalli-inspires-viewers-to-segregate-waste/articleshow/74300817.cms

The organisers of Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival (DPIFF) have refuted her claims on her Instagram story that she received a certificate of appreciation for being the ‘Most Fashionable Contestant’ on the recently concluded reality show. They also issued an official statement on their Instagram stating that though she attended the ceremony, no such award was given to her. The organisers had sent the actress a notice asking her to take down all the misleading posts and demanded a written apology.Mahira issued a statement on Monday which read: “This is with regards to the statement issued by the social media team of Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival 2020. I would like to inform that the charges made against me for receiving and forging the award is untrue and totally uncalled for. In my defence, I would like to clarify with exact details on what happened that day.On Thursday, Feb 20, 2020, I was invited for the reputed Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival by Premal Mehta of Purple Fox Media along with Yash Naik, who is an artiste manager for the said award show. They informed us that they have been associated with Dadasaheb Awards for the past two years. My manager Abhinav Tanwar was informed by Mr Mehta that we will be gratified at the event with the title of ‘Most Fashionable Bigg Boss 13 contestant’. At the event, the team of Bigg Boss 13 was called on stage and gratified with a token of appreciation. On questioning about my solo award by my manager to Mr Mehta, he handed over the award to my manager stating that I cannot be called on stage owing to the huge hue and rush on stage. I did my media bytes at the event and later had put a social media story (on my personal Instagram account) to express my love and gratitude. Little did I know that this would turn against me within two days. Since Sunday night I was told that there has been some miscommunication and will be rectified as soon as possible.I would like to inform that I did not forge any award and would never intend to do so. The managing team of Premal Mehta and Yash Naik have taken the onus of this fiasco completely and have stated that I had nothing to do with it. For everyone’s clarity, I am attaching the mail signed by them which was sent to Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival 2020 management today morning. Also to add, I have all the required proofs and chats on me to prove myself not guilty. Post an amazing stint with Bigg Boss and having made it to the top seven list, I surely am not intending to look for any PR gimmick of this sort. In the wake of this scenario I would request the managing team of Dadasaheb Phalke International Film Festival 2020, to please look into the matter.”Following Mahira’s post, the authorities of DPIFF responded with an open letter saying, “To address Ms Mahira Sharma’s latest response on the forged DPIFF certification, it is really unappreciated that she still claims that the award has not been forged and is unapologetic about the same.We believe that being the only official authority of DPIFF award functions, we are in charge of confirming the authority of our awards and certificates. This, however, is unfortunately still unclear to Ms Mahira Sharma. Even now we are looking for an amicable resolution in this regard through an apology which we have asked for Ms Mahira Sharma to post. Even though she has called this incident to be ‘untrue’ we still stand by our claims in this matter and expect her to to share an apology. We shall be patiently waiting for the same.”So will Mahira issue an apology?

13,['26/02/2020'],Harvey Weinstein Case: Harvey Weinstein stays at hospital for 'chest pain' a day after his sexual assault conviction,"This story is from February 26, 2020

NEW YORK: Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein was receiving medical attention for chest pain at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan on Tuesday, his spokesman said, a day after a New York jury convicted him of sexual assault and rape in a stunning victory for the #MeToo movement.

Once one of Hollywood's most influential producers, Weinstein , 67, was found guilty on Monday of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping Jessica Mann , a onetime aspiring actress, in 2013.

More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual assault, and Weinstein has denied all of the accusations and said any sexual encounters were consensual. The allegations helped fuel the #MeToo movement on social media in 2017, which inspired more women to publicly accuse powerful men of misconduct.

Juda Engelmayer , a spokesman for Weinstein , said on Monday that the onetime movie mogul was taken to Bellevue Hospital, which has a unit that provides medical care for jail inmates, after he was led away from court in handcuffs. If not for his medical concerns, the former producer would have gone to New York City's Rikers Island jail complex.

Weinstein remained in the hospital on Tuesday as a ""precautionary measure"" because he had complained of chest pain, and he was expecting a visit from his legal team later in the day, Engelmayer said on Tuesday.

After the verdict on Monday Arthur Aidala, one of Weinstein 's lawyers, quoted his client as saying, ""I’m innocent. I’m innocent. How can this happen in America ?""

His sentencing hearing was set for March 11. The attorney vowed to appeal.

Weinstein , who produced acclaimed films like ""The English Patient"" and ""Shakespeare in Love,"" faces up to 25 years in prison on the sexual assault conviction. He was also convicted of third degree rape - sexual intercourse without consent - which carries a prison sentence of up to four years.

The jury of seven men and five women acquitted Weinstein on the most serious charges, which carried a potential life sentence.

A statement from the leaders of the #MeToo movement said: ""The jury worked with an incredibly narrow and unjust set of laws governing sexual assault, and though he was not convicted on all counts, Harvey Weinstein will have to answer for his crimes.""

A long legal battle in the appeals courts is likely to ensue. At the start of the trial, defense lawyers accused the judge of bias, the prosecutors of withholding evidence, and the media of turning the trial into a circus.

Weinstein still faces sexual assault charges in California, which were announced just hours after his New York trial began on Jan. 6. Dozens of women have also filed civil lawsuits against him.

""Just seeing someone so powerful taken down and being held accountable for his action - is a huge moment,"" Dawn Dunning , an actress-turned-costume designer who testified against Weinstein , told CNN on Tuesday. ""I don't look at this as the end of a trial, it's the beginning of something bigger.""

Isro is set to launch a new-age geo-imaging satellite Gisat-1 from Sriharikota on March 5.

NEW DELHI: Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) is set to launch a new-age geo-imaging satellite Gisat-1 from Sriharikota on March 5 with the capability to perform real-time and constant watch of the Indian subcontinent.

GSLV-F10 rocket will launch Gisat-1 from the second launchpad at 5.43 pm, subject to weather conditions.

Weighing 2,275 kg, Gisat-1 is a state-of-the-art agile earth observation satellite that will be placed in a geosynchronous transfer orbit at 36,000km altitude. Operating from the geostationary orbit, Gisat-1 will facilitate near real-time observation of the Indian subcontinent, under cloud-free condition, at frequent intervals. Gisat-1 will apparently be in a fixed spot looking over the Indian continent at all times.

“Gisat-1 will do a full rotation of the Earth and come to the same point after every 2 hours. It is really good for fast imaging of the Earth and can perform constant and rapid surveillance. If needed, the satellite can observe a point for a longer duration,” says a source in Isro. This will be the first satellite launch of this year from Indian soil.

A 4-metre diameter Ogive-shaped payload fairing is being flown for the first time in this GSLV flight. This is the 14th flight of the GSLV.

In all, Isro will launch an unprecedented 10 earth observation satellites with space surveillance feature during 2020-21 in order to boost the country’s space surveillance power in order to strengthen border security and check terrorist infiltration.

NEW YORK: Opera singer Placido Domingo apologized to the women who have accused him of sexual harassment on Tuesday after an investigation by the American Guild of Musical Artists concluded he had behaved inappropriately with female performers.

One of the most feted and powerful opera stars of the modern era, Domingo said in a statement he had spent several months reflecting on the allegations made by his musical colleagues.

""I respect that these women finally felt comfortable enough to speak out, and I want them to know that I am truly sorry for the hurt that I caused them,"" he said.

More than three dozen singers, dancers, musicians, voice teachers and backstage staff have said they witnessed or experienced inappropriate behaviour by the 79-year-old Spanish singer towards women at different opera houses over the last three decades.

A former prosecutor was hired to investigate the complaints last September by the American Guild of Musical Artists (AGMA), the labor union that represents performers and producers in opera houses and concert halls across the United States.

The union , of which Domingo is a member, announced its findings on Tuesday.

""The investigation concluded that Mr. Domingo had, in fact, engaged in ?inappropriate activity, ranging from flirtation to sexual advances, in and outside of the workplace,"" the statement said. ""Many of the witnesses expressed fear of retaliation in the industry as their reason for not coming forward sooner.""

Domingo said in his statement he now understood the women 's fear.

""While that was never my intention, no one should ever be made to feel that way,"" he said. ""I am committed to affecting positive change in the opera industry so that no one else has to have that same experience.""

The union declined to make public its full report. Its board of governors will take ""appropriate action,"" the union statement said. Union spokeswoman Alicia Cook declined to discuss what action it would take regarding Domingo.

Domingo had disputed the allegations when they were first reported by the Associated Press (AP) last year, forcing him to sever ties with some of the foremost musical institutions in the United States.

Women told the AP that Domingo, who is married, forced wet kisses on them, groped them and sought to pressure them into meeting him privately outside work for sex. They described it as a pattern of behavior stretching back to the 1980s that had long been an open secret in the opera world.

Following the report, Domingo resigned as general manager of the Los Angeles Opera and pulled out of performing the title role in Verdi's ""Macbeth"" at the Metropolitan Opera in New York .

LA Opera said it would comment once officials there had finished reviewing the union 's findings. The Met did not respond to a request for comment.

The allegations had less of an impact on his career in Europe, and he was still due to sing and conduct at performances in Vienna, Madrid, London, Moscow and Hamburg in the coming months, according to his website.

The Teatro Real in Madrid and the Royal Opera House in London confirmed that Domingo would still appear on their stages for ""La Traviata"" and ""Don Carlo"" this year. Milan's Teatro alla Scala, where Domingo is scheduled to sing in ""La Traviata"" in November, declined to comment.

The Hamburg State Opera , where Domingo is booked to sing in March, said it took the complaints about Domingo ""very seriously."" Michael Bellgardt, a spokesman for the opera house, said his colleagues ""will also exchange information with the other institutions in Europe and then go public.""

As one of the Three Tenors singing group, Domingo, Jose Carreras and the late Luciano Pavarotti helped bring opera to a wider audience with concerts around the world in the 1990s. Domingo took to singing baritone roles later in his career.

The union will announce plans in the coming weeks to prevent sexual harassment in the future, Leonard Egert, national executive director of AGMA, said in a statement.

""AGMA's efforts to protect its members will not end with this investigation,"" Egert said. ""AGMA is calling upon all companies in Opera , Dance, and Choral concert fields to join an industry-wide initiative to positively change the culture.""

16,['26/02/2020'],"After years of struggle, Goa’s blind cricketers see a brighter future","This story is from February 26, 2020

PANAJI: Having won a trophy for the first time, Yeshwant Nageshkar was putting together a list of people he should thank for making this possible. There was the Goa Cricket Association (GCA) who funds the team’s travel, a senior official who contributes towards their boarding and one well-wisher who transferred money into the account, sent an email and asked to let him know – through email – if they needed more.

“I don’t know his identity. I want to thank him personally,” said Yeshwant, coach-cum-captain of Goa’s blind cricket team and secretary of the Blind Cricket Association of Goa .

Yeshwant has had to wait for a really long time to see the trophy in his boys’ hands.

For four years, he has been dreaming about this. For four years, he has been coaching, playing and finding support for the blind cricketers. As coach-cum-captain and secretary, nobody has had a bigger role to play. But when Goa eventually won a trophy, he wasn’t around.

“I have to undergo an eye operation so couldn’t be part of the team. But I’m delighted that we have managed to win a trophy. This is definitely the start of something good,” he told TOI after personally handing a bouquet of flowers to all players who alighted at the Karmali railway station on Tuesday.

The Konkan Kanya Express train from Mumbai was delayed by more than two hours, so the wait was even longer for Yeshwant, the only official waiting for his boys at the station.

“This trophy could have so easily been a bigger and better one. We should have emerged champions but even a runners-up trophy is good for a start. We defeated teams who were better prepared than us and enjoyed better facilities,” said captain Tukaram Gaonkar.

Goa lost to Gujarat in the final of the Paras Mal Champions Trophy, an inter-state cricket tournament for the visually impaired that had Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh also taking part in Ajmer.

Goa secured two victories against Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh in the league stage and qualified for the final where they succumbed to the might of Gujarat, a team they had so easily defeated earlier in the tournament.

In the final, Goa were bundled out for 185 while chasing Gujarat’s score of 235 in 20 overs.

“We had restricted Gujarat to 177 in the league game but in the final they struck form and scored 235. We weren’t overawed by the score since 12 (runs) an over is achievable but our main players were unlucky to get out. It became a stiff chase,” said vice-captain Aftab Patel.

Despite the final defeat, Goa had so much to cheer. The two victories in the league stage was their first this season, particularly after tough outings against top-ranked teams in the Nagesh Trophy. There were individual success stories too, none more impressive than Asutosh Maraskar (B3, partially sighted) who walked away with the Man-of-the-Match and Man-of-the-Series awards.

Asutosh was the highest scorer all along with scores of 48, 66 and 88 in the league games, while he managed 70 runs in the final. No other player could match his consistency and he is now touted to find a place in the Indian team for a two-match series against South Africa on April 2 and April 3 in Goa.

Akshay Borikar (B1, totally blind) and Sandeep Ghudge (B3, partially sighted) were among the notable performers too, while captain Tukaram also had allround success, particularly with the ball in his hand.

“We now have to train harder than ever before. We know we can defeat the top teams, only if our preparations are thorough. Our training camps at Marcel, Kavlem and St Cruz helped us a great deal,” said Yeshwant.

Goa’s next challenge is another four-state tournament at home with Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana among the invitees. Having made it to their first final, they’ll want to do even better on home soil.

17,['26/02/2020'],Julian Assange: WikiLeaks did not put lives at risk;Julian Assange in UK court,"This story is from February 26, 2020

LONDON: WikiLeaks did not put lives at risk by leaking people’s names when publishing classified US diplomatic cables, a lawyer for Julian Assange told a court in London on Tuesday during a hearing on Assange’s extradition to the US.

The US is seeking Assange’s extradition from London for publishing classified US documents in 2011. During the trial, James Lewis , an attorney for the US, claimed Assange had put lives at risk by leaking unredacted files. Mark Summers , who represents Assange, however said WikiLeaks had redacted all names from the files and that the US government was even involved in the redaction process.

Summers said a retired Guardian journalist was responsible for the leak. “Someone published a book which enabled the world to publish the unredacted materials,” he said, naming David Leigh ’s book “WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange’s War on Secrecy” as the direct source of the “unredacted leak”. Another defence attorney claimed Assange was handcuffed 11 times and stripped naked coming and going from court.

19,['26/02/2020'],Ankit Tiwari: I have not done as much work as Arijit Singh; you can’t compare us,"The trend of recreating retro songs in Bollywood seems to be at its peak at present. While playback singer and music composer Ankit Tiwari isn’t averse to the idea, he has his own priorities straight – he wants to stick to the originals. This, however, has not often yielded results, Ankit says.He tells us that as he always stuck to the original compositions and stayed away from singing rehashed versions of old songs, a lot of his contemporaries went ahead in the race. He was in Jaipur to perform at a campus fest. Ankit Tiwari in Jaipur (Shalini Maheshwari/BCCL)“I am not against remakes. They help in selling a film or creating a buzz around it. But it’s my personal choice to stick to original music. After Aashiqui 2, I sang Galliyan. Then I sang Tu Hai Ke Nahi and a number of other songs in films, including Airlift, Rustom, Baaghi etc. Yahaan tak sab sahi chal raha tha,” he says.“Then suddenly, this trend of remaking old songs made its way into Bollywood and everybody went gaga over it. Almost every second film today has a rehashed version of an old song. In fact, even non-filmi songs are now being rehashed and used in Bollywood films, which is a good thing. But I don’t want to be a part of that trend, not as a composer or as a singer. I have always loved originality. I am trying my best, but maybe because of that, meri speed thodi kam ho gayi hai. But that’s how it is and I am at peace with it,” he adds.Ankit Tiwari and Arijit Singh There was a time when Ankit and Arijit Singh were sailing in the same boat. But now, Arijit has completely swept over the industry, overshadowing the likes of Shaan, Mohit Chauhan and Atif Aslam . Opening up about the comparisons with Arijit, Ankit replies, “I have not done as much work as Arijit. So, you can’t compare us. I might have been in the industry for a longer period of time than him but he has done a lot more work. In fact, if you look at our work, you will see that Arijit has sung for a lot of big stars; I am yet to do that.”“And then, I am also a composer. I understand that this comparison started after Aashiqui 2. It used to affect me initially. But over the years, I have realised that we are simply drops in this ocean and everybody is doing his or her work and trying to give their best shot. I have a long way to go,” he adds.While Ankit has performed in the Pink City before, this was the first time he was performing at a college fest. “Jaipur is a city with a lot of genuine people. They appreciate your work. I think Jaipur ka ek andaz hai milne ka. It pulls you towards the city,” he says.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74301779,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-207589/74301779.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/music/news/ankit-tiwari-i-have-not-done-as-much-work-as-arijit-singh-you-cant-compare-us/articleshow/74301770.cms
20,['26/02/2020'],"Richa Chadha: Ali Fazal proposed to Richa Chadha in Maldives, the two to tie the knot in April","You will not see this couple indulging in too much PDA or featuring regularly on each other’s Instagram posts, but that hasn’t kept our attention away from Ali Fazal and Richa Chadha . Putting speculation to rest, our sources have confirmed that the couple will tie the knot in the third week of April. We hear it was a romantic proposal. Ali proposed to Richa in the Maldives a few months back, and it was an instant “yes” from his lady love. The wedding dates will be locked in the next few days, and April 15 is one of the options for the big day.A source revealed, “The question was never ‘would they’ but ‘when would they’ get married? The two first met on the set of Fukrey in 2012 and have been friends ever since. They started dating in 2015, made their relationship public in 2017 and now, they are all set to take the big leap. The wedding will happen in Delhi among close family and friends. The festivities will go on for two days. There will also be a party for their Bollywood friends in Mumbai after that.”Apparently, the couple has opted for an unconventional venue for their shaadi festivities. “Ali and Richa are going to go quirky with their wedding, owing to their personalities. The duo is working round the clock with their teams for interesting, unconventional venues and celebration ideas. The party in Mumbai will most likely be at a venue by the sea or in an experiential venue, something like a performing centre, which is a break from the usual venues.”While the two have been vocal about their relationship, the wedding news has been kept under wraps. Speaking of Ali, Richa had told us, “Ali is extremely supportive, and I couldn’t have asked for a better man in my life.Our relationship is a great creative partnership. No one that sees us together feels like it’s a mismatch. it’s rare to find like-minded people who share certain core values and have similar interests like poetry, music, films and literature. Ali is also progressive and liberal. To find someone like that in your industry is rare. Also, we never expected to end up together. It happened organically.”Ali had told us, “I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think it’s beautiful. Somewhere, we all stumble upon it, I guess. And maybe, I have thought about marriage, but I won’t speak about it yet.""",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74302449,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-179215/74302449.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/ali-fazal-proposed-to-richa-chadha-in-maldives-the-two-to-tie-the-knot-in-april/articleshow/74302280.cms
21,['26/02/2020'],#MentalHealthAwareness: Celebs open up about struggles with depression,"The immense pressure to perform, not be bashed online and still score at the box-office takes a toll on celebrities in the entire showbiz circuit. For every success story, there seems to be a counterpoint in the number of suicide attempts being reported. The recent deaths of Kushal Punjabi and Sejal Sharma put the much-needed spotlight on depression and mental health again. The conversation around these issues, however, are no longer muted as over the years, actresses like Deepika Padukone and Anushka Sharma have opened up about their own struggles. This has helped others to talk about their struggle with depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder. We spoke to some celebs in recent times, who shared their breakdown stories and how they overcame it.“It took me over a year to realise that I was in depression,” says Shama Sikander, adding, “I’d cry for hours for no reason. I’d have no desire to go anywhere or do anything. All I wanted to do was sleep, but I couldn’t. It’s when a friend told me that I might be suffering from depression that I got myself checked. This was some seven years ago.” Shama says that she also attempted suicide around that time. “I can’t pinpoint what got me into that state. I thought the world was extremely selfish. It took me almost five years to come out of that state of mind. Having said that, I don’t think it ever goes away. The only difference is that I’m not threatened by it anymore. It has become my friend,” she says, adding, “The awareness towards depression and towards your own truth is the most important. I had to be friends with my darkness. I had to accept myself fully, I had to learn to love myself fully. It’s the only way to fight it.”Anjana Sukhani chose to take a two-year sabbatical from films when she found that she was clinically depressed. “I decided to open up about my depression, but I was warned against doing that. I was told that if I do that, I won’t get work. But I thought mere bolne se agar ek zindagi bach jaati hai ya ek zindagi badal jaati hai, then my job is done,” recalls the actress.” She continues, “The cost of counselling and treatment is another aspect that gets ignored. Counsellors and therapists are expensive and beyond the reach of a certain strata of society; everyone should be able to afford treatment.”For someone who saw immense popularity with TV, Sharad Malhotra found it hard to come to terms with the failure of his debut film. “There seemed to be no balance at what I was experiencing – my first TV show, Banu Main Teri Dulhann was super successful, but my debut in films with From Sydney With Love was just the opposite of it,” he looks back, adding, “I went through a low phase after the film didn’t work out. It even affected my personal life. I didn’t know where to look for help. Finally I took to spiritualism, which calmed me as a person.” He adds, “One must be vocal about one’s issues and emotions. Suppressing them can lead to depression.”She’s all bubbly and vivacious in her television shows, but Jasmin Bhasin admits to having been through a dark phase. “I had come to Mumbai and had no friends and family,” says the actress who made her acting debut in a Tamil film, Vaanam. “Things were not in my favour initially. I was so low that I started finding flaws in my own body and even, stopped going for auditions for some days. I felt hopeless. Over time, I made a few friends, who cheered me up and motivated me. Having the right people and environment is necessary to maintain your mental health,” she adds.Sahil Khattar is known for his funny streak, but he’s been through a meltdown, too. “I had everything going for me, but it all changed when my longtime girlfriend broke up with me,” recalls the actor, host and radio jockey. “Within a week my father fell ill and was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. I just took a flight to Chandigarh and left Mumbai without informing the radio station where I worked. I had crashed-out mentally.” However, that was just a beginning. “It’s when my dad returned home that my depression set in. I’d just sit on the couch at home, watch TV all day and eat only noodles and cereals. Finally, a friend, who was a psychologist, pulled me out of the house and took me to play snooker, which gave me the needed zest to come back to my life.” Sahil also says, “When you know that things are not going good, you have to occupy yourself doing what you love the most. That is how the happy hormones are generated.”is among the few from Bollywood who has openly spoken about her battle with depression, without mincing words. In an interview with Filmfare, she had shared, “My family and friends never let me feel as if something was wrong with me. They made me feel that what I was going through was okay. They supported my decision to take medication for depression.”has also been upfront about her issues with anxiety. In an interview with a magazine, she says,“I have anxiety. And I’m on medication for it. Why am I saying this? Because it’s a completely normal thing. I want to make this my mission, to take any shame out of this, to educate people about this.”spoke about his bipolar disorder in an interview with us last year. “It went on for 18 months, during which I changed four doctors.

Talking of sports biopics, there are at least two coming up, where we will see you being portrayed on screen – one of yours and one on PV Sindhu. Then there is the Saina biopic where reports say the coach’s character will be an amalgamation of all her coaches, which includes you, too. When these actors come and meet you or talk to you, apart from the mannerisms, what do you try and tell them so that they can understand your psyche and portray you better?

And you are ok with that dramatisation?

Coaching isn’t a straightforward thing. How a coach deals with a 12-year-old kid cannot be the same way you are with a senior

athlete

, particularly because senior athletes are more prone to rebelling or having their own viewpoints that may be divergent from those of the coach. How do you tackle that?

Manav Kaul will play Parineeti's coach in Saina Nehwal biopic

Pullela Gopichand doesn’t watch many films. He admits that the last film he watched was over a year ago, and it’s ironic that the celebrated coach will be portrayed in three mainstream movies over the next two years. In a freewheeling chat with us, the national badminton coach talks about the utility of sports biopics for sportspersons, how he would want to see himself on screen, and on his philosophies on coaching. Excerpts:I have two views on this. The first is that storytelling in sports is very important, as is creating those role models. That’s when people get inspired and take up a sport. Inspiration is important. When I see a sports movie, unfortunately, I say ‘this is not real’. When I see a regular movie and say, a fight takes place, I don’t say ‘this is unrealistic’ but in a sports story, I am thinking, ‘She is not playing the way she should’ or ‘This is not the way it happens on the field’. Yes, there will be instances where you see things that can happen but the dramatisation is probably what is too much. But I’m still okay with that.Yes, I agree. There are parts of a sportsperson’s life which would be dramatic but you just have to compress it to get it on screen. But yes, there are instances which will connect with people. Things like injuries, poverty, and pushing through family’s support, the wins and defeats, the last-minute thrills are all there. You just have to compress them.I have met Sonu Sood a few times (who portrays him in Sindhu’s biopic). But really it’s more about mannerisms. I think the movies that are being made are more about the athletes and the coach may not be the central figure. I’m sure there is a lot of dramatisation because of the way I am, I don’t think it’s going to make a very good script for an on-screen hero. I’m not so noisy or dramatic to portray something great. I don’t think there would be any interest in portraying me the way I am.Do I have a choice?My first coach was Hamid Hussain. He made me fall in love with the sport. I would want to go to the courts because he was there. He was a big Pathan and would address me as, ‘!’ But we’d love to be in the stadium. My next coach was Arif(Dronacharya awardee SM Arif) and he was a disciplinarian. Later I was at the Prakash Padukone Academy with Prakash sir. At each stage, I look back and see that when a kid starts, he should have a coach that makes him love the sport. When he loves it, you need to be disciplined and structured. Then once you are disciplined, you need to be someone who sets a goal and has an aspiration. That’s how Prakash sir was. And then in the later stages of your career, you need someone who is a co-pilot in your car, who sits next to you and you both navigate the vehicle together. That’s how the relationship between a senior athlete and a coach is. At every stage the situation is different. The coach who is able to mould himself and get to that stage is the most productive.I think we are living in a society that is changing. You can’t really equate all elite athletes. You have to take into account culture and upbringing, too. But yes, you have different challenges today. You have athlete managers coming into the picture as well as cultural norms at play. There is a culture in the society that asks you to question. We are moving in a zone that is changing. We are also not a country that has a specific culture. We have some roots in thesystem where theas the final authority is one thought. But on the other hand, we have a questioning mentality that has come from the west, where you feel this is my job. The athlete thinks you do your job and I’ll do mine. You are looking at a very mixed society so it is a challenging space to be in.I think it’s the upbringing. It’s the number of times you have fallen down in life and remembering that the ups and downs are not permanent. You kind of stay in the middle. As a coach, it’s about where you focus on. You want to look at the top two wins and think ‘I’m super successful’ or look at the entire scenario and try to reduce the percentage of the times you’ve been unsuccessful. It’s tricky, because you need to see the wins to stay positive but look at the failures to not get complacent. I go back to the Olympic finals (where Sindhu won the silver) and I think ‘superb!’, but I also think why my sub-junior players lost here. That night, I thought ‘This is over but what about the rest of them, whom I had left for six months’.

The resolution, virtually a copy of CM Nitish Kumar ’s response to the Centre’s letter seeking feedback on NPR , also states that “the National Register of Citizens (NRC) is not needed in Bihar”.None of the BJP members present in the assembly — the party has 54 MLAs — opposed the resolution when Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary sought to know if it had the consent of the ruling and opposition benches. “For the smooth functioning of the House, it was essential for this resolution to be unanimously adopted,” Choudhary later told TOI.Nitish clarified in the assembly that the Centre had sought feedback from all states on NPR, but he took the opportunity to also communicate his government’s stand on the NRC. “The Bihar government has communicated to the Centre that the NPR format should be the same as it was in 2010, and only the transgender column should be added to it. We have also communicated that the NRC is not needed in Bihar,” he said.Earlier in the day, there was a commotion in the assembly after RJD functionary Tejashwi Prasad Yadav moved an adjournment notice on NPR and CPI-ML legislator Mehboob Alam a separate one on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, NPR and NRC. Some BJP and RJD members almost came to blows when Tejashwi dubbed CAA a “black law”.Defending his party’s support to CAA in Parliament, Nitish cited previous statements of former PM Manmohan Singh and other Congress members demanding Indian citizenship for persecuted minorities from some neighbouring countries.Tejashwi claimed that the state government moved the resolution on NPR and NRC under pressure from RJD, a statement that was immediately contested by JD(U)’s ally BJP.State BJP vice-president and Baikunthpur MLA Mithilesh Tiwari told TOI: “The PM has clarified that there has been no discussion on NRC.

He said 400 police personnel were injured in stone-pelting by protesters while 61 cops suffered gunshot injuries.At least 21 people were killed in violence during anti-CAA protests across UP on December 19 and 20.

Yogi had earlier ordered issuance of recovery notices to the protesters who damaged public property during violence.

DELHI: In the past 10 days, Supreme Court judges and thousands of lawyers practising there have been spooked by H1N1 with five judges kept in isolation on being found infected with the virus. This derailed day-to-day hearing by a nine-judge bench to outline the ambit and scope of right to religion.The first to be struck down by H1N1 was a judge who is part of the nine-judge bench which on February 10 heard arguments for just two hours. The judge’s illness has derailed the hearing since then. He has almost recovered, brightening the chances of early resumption of hearing. After him, the flu spread quickly, catching four others.Of the four, three had a milder attack of H1N1. Though infected much later than the first judge, they have fully recovered and resumed court work on Tuesday.The sitting of many courts had to be cancelled as apart from these five, another judge slipped in the bathroom at his residence a fortnight ago and injured his spinal cord. He has been advised rest and will take weeks to recover. A woman judge had an attack of nausea on Monday and is expected to resume work on Wednesday.The health ministry said, “All the judges were provided treatment as per the protocol. Prophylactic treatment was also given to all who have come in contact with them including their family members. All five judges were kept in home isolation. Of these, three judges have already resumed their duty and two continue to be under home isolation/observation and are recovering.”Given the unprecedented situation, CJI S A Bobde met his colleagues Tuesday morning and discussed a plan of action to contain spread of the virus. The health ministry was also contacted. After a detailed discussion, the CJI asked the health department to take urgent measures — equipping the first aid post of CGHS in the SC complex and sanitising courtrooms and judges’ residences.According to SC sources, the health department has agreed to open a temporary medical dispensary that will help identify lawyers and court staff infected with H1N1 and inoculate on a chargeable basis.The effect of this unprecedented virus attack was evident on the judges. Justice D Y Chandrachud told lawyers in the morning that six judges were affected by H1N1 virus and that the SC was taking steps to make inoculation available to lawyers. Justice Arun Mishra was seen advising lawyers who were feeling unwell to stay home and rest. “It is a request to everyone.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court questioned aviation regulator DGCA Tuesday for “endorsing” the decision of three airlines other than IndiGo to ban comedian Kunal Kamra for allegedly heckling a journalist on board.The court asked the DGCA to clarify by Thursday why it “certified” the action of other airlines to penalise Kamra without any inquiry by the authorities. “Why did you (DGCA) give a certification on Twitter,” Justice Navin Chawla asked the counsel for the regulator while hearing a plea by Kamra challenging IndiGo’s decision to ban him from its flights for six months.Chawla asked DGCA’s lawyer to come prepared on the next date to explain how the action by these airlines was in tune with civil aviation requirements (CAR) rules.The HC also remarked that once Kamra had informed the DGCA of the violation of CAR by the airlines which had banned him, the regulator could not say it would not examine or look into it.Appearing for Kamra, senior advocates Vivek Tankha , Gopal Sankaranarayanan and Mohit Mathur underlined that for perhaps the first time in the history of Indian civil aviation, all airlines imposed a flying ban on him without there being a complaint as required under CAR.“Even more shocking is the fact that other airlines — Air India , GoAir and SpiceJet — on which the petitioner was not even travelling (and in respect of which there was never any allegation against the petitioner), also followed suit and banned him for an indefinite period,” the plea says, noting that even IndiGo handed down a six-month ban before it received a complaint.Tankha apprised the court that CAR lays down that it is the pilot of the flight who must receive a complaint, but no such complaint was made. Even then the airline set up an internal committee which has scheduled a final hearing of the matter on February 26.His plea argues that the other airlines — Air India, SpiceJet and GoAir — banned him for an indefinite period without even setting up an internal committee to enquire into the issue, prompting Justice Chawla to demand an explanation from the airlines on why they acted without a committee and put him on a no-fly list.The comedian has sought directions to the DGCA to direct the airlines to revoke the ban and also action against them for alleged violation of CAR.The DGCA said in its defence that it was only a regulator and the airlines had the freedom under CAR to take action against passengers for unruly or disruptive behaviour. “As per CAR, it is an internal decision of the airlines,” the DGCA told the court and added that the other carriers be also made a party in the matter as the regulator cannot answer for them.IndiGo said its internal committee was already looking into the matter and would give its decision soon.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74309683,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50881,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hc-pulls-up-dgca-over-kunal-kamra-flying-ban/articleshow/74309678.cms
35,['26/02/2020'],Donald Trump: CAA is up to India. I hope it’ll take the right decision for its people,"President Trump and PM Modi arrive for their joint news conference at Hyderabad House in New Delhi. (Reuters p... Read More

NEW DELHI: Even as violence over the Citizenship Amendment Act wracked the capital, US President Donald Trump said, “I want to leave that to India, hopefully they will make the right decision for the country.”Responding to questions at a press conference here on Tuesday, Trump refused to get drawn into a discussion over CAA as he wrapped up a high-octane two-day state visit, even as he said he had discussed the issue of religious freedom with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their official talks at Hyderabad House .The outcome of the Modi-Trump talks contained in the joint statement unequivocally reflected Indian concerns over Pakistan’s role as a terror sponsor. “Prime Minister Modi and President Trump denounced any use of terrorist proxies and strongly condemned cross-border terrorism in all its forms,” the statement said and asked Pakistan to ensure no territory under its control is used to launch terrorist attacks.The statement further called on Pakistan to expeditiously bring to justice perpetrators of such attacks, including 26/11 and Pathankot. “They called for concerted action against all terrorist groups including Al-Qaida, IS, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizb-ul Mujahideen, the Haqqani Network , TTP, D-Company and all their affiliates,” it said.In his media interaction, asked about incidents of violence in the national capital during his visit, Trump said he hadn’t discussed “individual attacks” with Modi. “That’s up to India. I hope it will take the right decision for its people,” he added.Replying to another question, Trump, who in his opening remarks had made it plain that he was not going to say anything “controversial” that might cast a shadow on the trip, said he was satisfied with what he’d heard from Modi about religious freedom in India.“We did talk about religious freedom. I will say that the PM was incredible and he told me that he wants people to have religious freedom. He told me that in India they have worked very hard to have great and open religious freedom,” he said.Asked about alleged discrimination against Muslims and rise in hate crimes against them under Modi, the president said, “Well, we discussed that and specifically Muslims and we also discussed Christians, I had a very powerful answer from the PM. We talked about religious liberty for a long period of time in front of a lot of people and I had a very, very powerful answer. And the PM said we have 200 million Muslims in India and a fairly short while ago they had 14 million and he said they have been working very closely with the community.”Trump’s disinclination to speak on CAA must come as a relief for the government, which had billed the visit as a big leap in India-US ties aimed at cementing and advancing a crucial strategic partnership spanning anti-terrorism cooperation to trade and commerce.On another tricky terrain, that of Kashmir, Trump repeated his favourite formulation that he could help or mediate and referred to there being “two sides to every story” but did so without any particular vehemence.“We talked a lot about Pakistan. I have very good relations with PM Imran Khan. We talked about it at length actually. No question that it’s a problem. But it’s a problem they have been working on. India is a brave nation and I have said I will do whatever I can do because my relations with both gentlemen (Modi and Khan) is so good. But there have been difficulties in Pakistan and we are seeing what we can do about it. Anything I can do to mediate, anything I can do to help, I will do,” Trump said.He also emphasised the convergence between the two countries as well as between him and Modi on terrorism. “We discussed terrorism and I think we have some very good ideas. I feel very strongly against terrorism. PM Modi is a very religious man as you know, he is a very calm man but actually he is a very very strong person. Very tough actually, I have seen him in action and he has got that foremost in his mind-terrorism,” he said.The tenor of Trump’s remarks reflected the Indian side’s view that India and the US are increasingly moving together on critical areas of national security, energy and technology with ties rebadged as a “comprehensive global strategic partnership” as the two leaders announced earlier in remarks to media.The president’s remarks were punctuated with strong praise for Modi and an implicit acknowledgement that he found the PM’s response to issues of religious freedom in India and on terrorism sourced from Pakistan convincing.In his briefing, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said Trump did not specifically bring up CAA. “You would have heard President Trump in his speech yesterday in Ahmedabad referring to religious diversity and harmony that is evident in India; discussions really to the extent possible were on these lines on this issue,'' he said. ""The issue of CAA did not come up; there was appreciation from both sides that pluralism and diversity are a common binding factor of both countries,"" he added.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74309664,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-512254,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/caa-is-up-to-india-i-hope-itll-take-the-right-decision-for-its-people-president-trump/articleshow/74309556.cms
36,['26/02/2020'],Unnao rape convict Kuldeep Singh Sengar disqualified from UP House,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Lucknow: Expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar has been disqualified from the membership of the UP assembly, following his conviction in a rape case . The development has necessitated a byelection in Bangarmau assembly seat in Unnao, represented by Senger.

According to a notification issued by the Vidhan Sabha on February 20, Sengar has been disqualified as per the rules following his conviction by a Delhi court which had awarded the life imprisonment to the MLA on December 20 last year. With this the Bangarmau seat has fallen vacant from that date itself, the notification said. A senior official in Vidhan Sabha secretariat said that it would soon be informing about the Sengar’s disqualification to the Election Commission of India which will decide on the date for bypoll.

Sengar is the second BJP MLA to be disqualified after getting convicted in a criminal case. Last year in June, BJP Hamirpur MLA Ashok Singh Chandel was convicted by Allahabad HC in a 22-year old murder case. He, too, had been sentenced to life imprisonment, necessitating a byelection, which was won by BJP candidate Yuvraj Singh in September last year.

A four-term MLA, Sengar was expelled by BJP in August 2019 following a furore over his alleged involvement in rape of a minor at his Makhi village in Unnao in June 2017. The case came to the limelight after the survivor attempted self-immolation outside the CM’s residence in April 2018 when the police did not take action on her complaint. A few days later, her father died in police custody.

The case was later handed over to the CBI, which said it had evidence against Sengar. It filed four FIRs against Sengar and his aides and he was arrested, along with his brother Atul .

NEW DELHI: Several Indians stuck in China's Wuhan are waiting with bags packed for their evacuation by India from the coronavirus-hit city, but said there was still no clarity on when they would be able to leave.A day after the Union health ministry said Indians stranded in Wuhan would likely to be brought home on February 26, many Indians told TOI that the anxiety is playing havoc with their minds. A majority of them have remained confined to their homes for a month now as the city has remained under complete lockdown.“Every morning I wake up hoping that this will be the day we are told we are being taken to India, but by evening I lose hope again,” said a senior scientist in Wuhan who hails from Saharanpur (UP).On Tuesday, a message from the Indian embassy in Beijing on a Wechat group — which has 100 members waiting to be evacuated — asked members to “prepare for departure tomorrow morning (Wednesday)” but added that the arrangements were “still subject to change”. Earlier, official sources had said China was delaying clearance to the military transport aircraft which was to fly to Wuhan on February 20.Meanwhile, the Indians in Wuhan had signed consent forms for evacuation on February 19 itself and have been waiting since then. Ready with their luggage, they had then informed their families they were coming home.“It’s been a week since then,” the scientist at an R&D firm who’s been in Wuhan for six years now said, adding that he is surviving on ready-to-eat soup sachets he brought from India when he last visited in October. “Until February 16, supermarkets were open but now gates of the apartment complex are closed. Only those with a special permit can enter or exit. I had run out of food two weeks ago but my Chinese neighbours contacted authorities who gave me rations free of charge. But now the stock is over. How many times can I bother my neighbours? I don'y have much left.”In another apartment, an Indian from Himachal Pradesh employed with a biopharma company, said he hasn’t seen a soul in over 30 days. “When we need something, we contact community leaders (similar to RWA presidents). Items are delivered to the doorstep and we receive a text alert. There is no human contact,” he said.At the Wuhan Textile University , associate professor Ashish Yadav and wife, Neha, have been stocking up masks, sanitisers and disinfectant sprays. The couple was not evacuated earlier as Neha was on bed rest following a surgery but their worries have grown since three hostel buildings in the varsity, a few metres away, have been turned into medical wards to keep suspected coronavirus patients in isolation.The coronavirus scare has prompted at least two Indians to hand in their resignations. Akshay Vats, who works with a two-wheeler manufacturing firm in Hubei , said the company has told him that quitting would be in violation of his contract. “I won’t get dues of 80,000 yuan (Rs 8 lakh approx) and I’m also being asked to forfeit my salary in lieu of notice period.” Vats, however, added that he was facing pressure from his concerned family to return.A sales agent with a Hong Kong-headquartered casino operator has also been told to pay back the money for medical insurance and housing loan that his company had offered as part of his salary component. “I can’t arrange so much money at a moment’s notice. Companies need to show more compassion in such cases.”The hardships have mounted. While the scientist is surviving on soup, another has been living in a hotel. At least two Indian professionals who decided to quit their jobs and leave China permanently now face penalties for violation of contracts.With evacuation delayed, other issues have cropped up. Several Chinese companies are slated to open on the second week of March and expat workers have been told that if they are not back when offices open, it will be counted as leave without pay.Many have even offered to pay for their tickets, if that helps speed things up.

The FSSAI recommends consumption of some items like rasgullas, badam milk, rasmalai and rajbhog within two day... Read More

NEW DELHI: Before buying laddoo, sandesh or rasmalai from your neighbourhood sweet shop, you may soon be able to check the manufacturing and ‘best before’ dates of such non-packaged sweet items.

The Food Safety and Standard Authority of India ( FSSAI ) has made it mandatory for sweet shops to display these details even on non-packaged or loose sweets from June 1. At present, it is mandatory to mention them on labels of packaged sweets.

The latest regulatory move comes in wake of FSSAI receiving complaints about sale of stale or expired non-packaged sweets posing potential health hazards to consumers.

“In public interest and to ensure food safety, it has been decided that in case of non-packaged/loose sweets, the container/tray holding sweets at the outlet should display the ‘date of manufacturing’ and ‘best before’ date of the product,” the food regulator said in its order.

The regulator said food business operators ( FBOs ) should decide and display the ‘best before’ date for non-packaged sweets depending upon the nature of the product and local conditions.

FSSAI has also issued an indicative list containing shelf life of various types of traditional sweets which can be referred to by FBOs for compliance. For instance, it recommends consumption of some items like rasgullas, badam milk, rasmalai and rajbhog within two days of manufacturing.

The regulator has asked state food safety commissioners to ensure compliance with these directions. However, traditional Indian sweet makers have expressed reservations over the order.

ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad high court on Tuesday directed the CBI to probe into the murder of mafia don Prem Prakash Singh alias Munna Bajrangi inside Baghpat district jail on July 9, 2018.

Hearing a writ petition filed by Bajrangi’s widow Seema Singh , a division bench comprising Justice Sudhir Agarwal and Justice Rajeev Mishra , directed the CBI to file a progress report of the investigation by April 20, the next date of hearing.

The petitioner’s contention was that there might be involvement of mafia elements behind the murder of her husband. Alleging that the role of jail officials was also doubtful, she pleaded that the investigation must be transferred to the CBI to unearth the conspiracy behind the killing .

Seema had held a press conference at Lucknow Press Club on June 29 in which she had also alleged that UP Police’s special task force (STF) was hatching a conspiracy to eliminate her husband.

PATNA: Trade, commerce and industry bodies gave a mixed response to the Rs 2,11,761 crore state budget for the 2020-21 fiscal presented by deputy CM-cum-finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi in the assembly on Tuesday.

Abhishek Kumar, secretary general of Bihar Entrepreneurs’ Association, said the state government should have focused more on small and micro enterprises as it contributes to the growth of the state.

“In a bid to encourage small industries and startups, the government should have created better marketing, funding and business ecosystem. Creation of incubation centres backed by experts of industries associations and entrepreneurs was the need of the hour. The state government should also have focused on establishment of food parks and jute clusters,” Abhishek said.

Sanjay Bhartiya, vice-president of Bihar Industries Association (BIA), said the allocation for industries sector slightly increased from previous year. “Last year, the industries department got Rs 585 crore under the scheme head. The allocation has increased to Rs 810 crore this time,” he said.

Bhartiya added, “It is only through industries that sustainable employment is created and the state government receives revenue in the form of tax.”

Bihar Industries Association president Ram Lal Khetan congratulated the state government for achieving 15.01% growth rate. “A large sum has been proposed for various schemes to strengthen the state’s economy,” he said.

Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries chairperson P K Agarwal also hailed the budget. “The budget is good if we consider the larger perspective. However, we were expecting allocation of Rs 2,000 crore for industries sector,” he added.

Bareilly: An adult leopard was killed on Monday night in Fatehganj West area of Bareilly after it was run over by a truck. The leopard which sustained head injuries died on the spot. The carcass was spotted by locals who alerted the forest department. It is suspected that big cat was the same leopard which had been living in defunct rubber factory and adjoining villages for the past two years.

This is the third case of leopard death in an accident in West UP in a month. Earlier this month, two big cats were killed in road and rail accidents, respectively, in Bijnor.

This is also the eighth case of leopard death in west UP this year. Three of them were killed by villagers in Bijnor, Moradabad and Badaun, respectively. While the fourth died of age–related issues in Bulandshahr’s Bawanpur village. These deaths took place in January. Another three-year-old succumbed to some disease in Bijnor earlier this month.

Divisional forest officer Bharat Lal said, “When the leopard was crossing the road around 10.30 pm on Monday, it was run over by an unidentified vehicle. The leopard sustained severe head injury as its skull was broken and its blood spilled all over the road. Some villagers who were passing by spotted the carcass of the big cat and moved it to roadside.”

Forest officials on Tuesday sent the leopard carcass to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) for post-mortem and the report is expected to arrive in a couple of days. “Forest range officer will give a police complaint against unidentified driver of the vehicle,” said Lal.

Forest officials suspect that the leopard which was killed on Monday was the same big cat which had been living in and round the defunct rubber factory for almost two years. “As the road accident happened in Fatehganj West, it is suspected that it was same leopard which has been spotted moving about in the area for almost two years. The leopard of the rubber factory often strayed into villages situated on the banks of Sanka river but never harmed any human,” said Lal.

Officials said the objective was to have better connectivity between Action Area I and III, and a synchronized transport system with the new Metro alignment.At present, the three Action Areas are connected to each other by four arterial roads. Hidco has introduced electric buses and the Metro construction is on parallel to the main arterial road. However, with the Metro alignment passing only through Action Areas I and II, Action Area III is yet to connected with the Metro and other public transport.“Action Area III is a huge place with several important institutions. There will be a huge surge of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in this area in the near future and keeping this in mind, we must have a plan in hand for an advanced urban public transport system which will be able to synchronize this traffic with the Metro alignment. This will ensure better and faster transportation from Action Area I and II to Action Area III,” said a Hidco official.“The new transport system will likely be in the form of a ropeway or a personalized transit system like podcars. It could also be a light rail transit system.

53,['26/02/2020'],"Coronavirus Update: Not just drugs, medical devices may go out of market","MUMBAI: It’s not just critical medicines that could witness potential shortages due to the coronavirus outbreak. Commonly used medical devices like digital thermometers, infrared thermometers, nebulizers, blood pressure monitors and glucometers could face the same risk soon.Manufacturers of med devices have started pressing the panic button as they are running out of key raw materials — mainly the electronic parts for these items, imported from regions like Hangzhou and Dongguan in China. With no sign of supplies being replenished anytime soon, their assembly lines could face closure from March-end or April onwards.At present, a majority of the demand for infrared thermometers (temperature gun) is from China itself, which is facing the worst-ever outbreak with cases still rising. There have been hundreds of enquiries, particularly for infrared & digital thermometers, from neighbouring countries too like South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong, and even African countries.As a result, a section of the industry wants the government to restrict exports of such critical items as infrared & digital thermometers, and three-layer surgical masks to build a stockpile to tackle the pandemic.Further, with the disruption in supply chain, increase in prices of raw materials & components and higher cost of shipments, margins for companies are getting squeezed, which could impact profitability. Worst hit are companies that import finished devices (from China) and market them in India, and those that assemble items after importing the raw materials/components from China.The $15-billion medical devices market is heavily import-dependent — at around 80%, with imaging equipment ( CT MRI scanners), cardiac stents, orthopaedic implants, syringes, glucometers, and critical care equipment cornering a large share (see graphic). For consumables and disposables like gloves, crepe bandages, IV sets, blood transfusion sets and syringes, there are several small to medium players, largely in the unorganised sector. Only 10-20% medical devices are manufactured in India, and even for these there’s a high dependence on input raw materials and components from China now.“The small to medium players will get impacted due to coronavirus as they are dependent on China for raw materials, components and packaging materials. Most companies have one-two months of stock. We may see some disruption in the coming weeks. Already domestic raw material suppliers have started increasing prices,” said Himanshu Baid , MD of Poly Medicure. The company is engaged in IV catheters, blood bags and dialyzers. Baid added the company is not impacted as it has minimal imports from China.The problem is acute for both infrared & digital thermometers with companies and wholesale distributors fast running out of stock. Infrared or non-contact forehead thermometers used at public places and airports are fully imported (with no indigenous manufacture). For digital thermometers, a few companies import electronic components from China, and assembly is done here.With the number of coronavirus cases rising, China is scrambling to import infrared thermometers from India, at even three-four times the earlier rate of Rs 800-900, according to a market player. For digital thermometers, wholesale rates have doubled to Rs 70. Earlier, rates of masks had skyrocketed amid the surge in demand following the outbreak.“We have 20,000 pieces of Infi digital thermometer which will end in a month, after which there are no stocks of electronic components,” said Tarun Arora, director of Infinity Mediquip. As for nebulizers, where the company is a significant player, he says the assembly line will have to be shut in April if shipments do not move from China soon. H C Gupta of Hicks Thermometers (India), a company which has a major share in digital thermometers and imports the finished product, said it is on the verge of zero stocks of both thermometers and BP instruments, due to supplies being indefinitely delayed.Companies assembling blood pressure monitors and glucometers are facing a glitch too. “We are facing problems in supply of raw materials for pregnancy kits, thermometers and nebulizers, and have stocks till April,” J S Kohli, who has an assembly unit in Delhi, said.Association of Indian Manufacturers of Medical Devices ( AiMeD ) forum coordinator Rajiv Nath says India needs to urgently create a stockpile of essential drugs and critical medical devices for disaster management. Dr G S K Velu of Trivitron Healthcare summed it up by saying that the real impact on industry will be visible only after April.

CHENNAI: Rising strife and damages caused is forcing companies to purchase liability insurance , which covers loss and damage caused due to natural disasters, burglary and riots. Some insurers are witnessing a 50% increase in policies sold.

“We have seen about 20% increase on yearly basis in the sales of our product — Public Liability Insurance (Industrial Risks) Policy — which provides coverage to accidental death, body injury or disease, loss or damage to property. It also covers legal costs and expenses incurred which is within the limit of indemnity. The loss claim ration is around 50%-60%,” says Sanjay Dutta, chief, Underwriting and Claims, ICICI Lombard General Insurance.

SBI General has seen an increase in both policies sold and premium earned. “Higher conversion rate of liability, from queries turning into sales, seen under directors and officers (D&O) liability policy, with 80% rise in sales. With the amendment of Companies Act, 2013, more companies are keen on insuring their officers, directors and independent directors. Even premium charged has increased up to Rs 2.5-Rs 2.8 crore, from Rs 1.4-Rs 1.5 crore for sum assured value in the range of Rs 5-Rs 25 crore in the past one year,” Vaidyanath Balasubramanian, Underwriting Manager, SBI General Insurance said.

Shreeraj Deshpande, COO, Future Generali India Insurance , said they have seen 30%-40% higher sales in public liability covers were driven by educational institutions, as compared to 50%-60% higher sales among product liability covers due to export requirements.

The insurance company said it does record more claims to cover damages from policyholders running businesses in the auto industry and pharmaceutical business. Deshpande said, “The overall loss claims ratio stands at 40%-50%, which is much better as litigations are lower in India. However, we so see higher awareness on liability insurance. Even the overall premium for this cover gone up by 10%-20% compared to previous year.”

AURANGABAD: Beed MP Pritam Munde on Tuesday took part in the state-wide stir called by the BJP against the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.

Munde, along with her supporters, staged a sit-in agitation outside the Beed district collectorate and criticised the state government on issues like women’s safety, farm loan waiver , among others.

With the ongoing budget session of the state assembly, the BJP, which is in the opposition, has launched the BJP Elgar campaign under which agitations will be held across the state against the coalition government of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.

A similar agitation was held in Aurangabad district and it was led by BJP city chief Sanjay Kenekar.

In Beed, the protestors held placards and raised slogans against the MVA government. Raising the recent incidents of violence against a woman in Hinganghat and rape of minors, Munde said that the instead of addressing the failure of the administration in ensuring women safety, the ministers of the Maha Vikas Aghadhi government are busy being felicitated in their constituencies.

In a memorandum submitted to the district collectorate, the agitators called for implementation of complete loan waiver for farmers and assistance of Rs 25,000 per hectare for crop loss and Rs 50,000 per hectare for fruit farms damaged due to unseasonal rains in October 2019, among other demands.

It was also stated in the memorandum that none of the insurance companies have signed an agreement with the state government for crop insurance for the current rabi season in Beed district and demanded help for loss of rabi crop.

“Cases of eve-teasing and crimes against women have increased so the government should contain such crimes by efficient police administration,” Munde said.

INDORE: Beware, Indore residents are being duped of lakhs by fraudsters , who ask them to download remote access applications by offering to update their ‘e-KYC’ for e-wallet applications. The company has also warned users recently by sending out alert texts against fake KYC update messages.

According to SP Jitendra Singh, over half-a-dozen similar cases have been reported in the city in past one week. “There is no age or education bar in such scams. They randomly send messages and whoever responds by calling is duped,” he said.

While explaining modus operandi, Singh said that customer gets a message for KYC verification and a warning that e-wallet account would be blocked if verification is not done.

The customer calls the number provided in message and is directed to a fraudulent customer care.

“A man, who has got extensive training in duping people over calls, asks the victim to download an app like Team viewer or quicksupport, which actually is a remote access application granting complete control to a device located elsewhere,” he said.

The ‘online KYC’ team makes the customer log on to the app to get the password details for their account.

The customer is then asked to make a token payment from their debit or credit card so that the e-wallet can get access to account details for transaction.

“Fraudsters can get full access to bank information through this so even if the victim clicks on the message, they can read the OTP and get information,” said investigating officer Pooja Muvel.

She said, “One of the elderly victims had called the number to update the KYC. The call went on for over three hours before the accused duped over Rs 1.5 lakh in different transactions. The accused also asked him for another number and he called on that such that he could direct the elderly man how to download the application on his phone.”

The complainant told TOI that the message looked real and by the time he could understand what was happening, he had already lost over Rs 1 lakh.

AURANGABAD: Around six years after two workers died while cleaning a drainage line in Nanded city, two people from the management of a Hyderabad-based firm — contracted by the Nanded Municipal Corporation — have been booked by the police for causing death due to negligence.

The duo has also been slapped with sections of Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013. An offence was registered with Itwara police station in Nanded after father of one of the deceased workers lodged a complaint on Monday.

The deceased — Shaikh Yusuf (24) and Mohammed Yasin (26) — were hired by the Hyderabad-based firm for carrying out the cleaning work. As per the complaint lodged by Yusuf’s father Shaikh Khajamiya (68), on May 22, 2014, the two workers drowned after inhaling the poisonous gas in the drainage line.

The work was being carried out in front of Eidgah Kaman at Deglur Naka. The complainant has stated that the contractor did not provide any safety gear to the workers before making them enter the drainage.

Investigation officer Arun Nagare said, “Records show that soon after the incident, a case of accidental death was registered, but as no one had come forward to lodge a complaint no offence was registered then.”

When contacted, complainant’s family claimed that they were not allowed to lodge a complaint by the representatives of the company. “We finally lodged a complaint in a hope of getting justice. We want the people at fault to be punished,” Tamiza Bi, Yusuf’s mother, said.

Police said they are not aware if the contractor is still catering to the civic body.

This includes 3.7% shares offloaded by SBI and 9.3% being sold by the Carlyle Group, which currently holds 24% stake in the company. Going by the price band and equity dilution, the post-issue valuation of the company ranges between Rs 70,425 crore and Rs 70,891 crore. This is the second SBI subsidiary to be listed after SBI Life, which is currently valued at Rs 90,095 crore.

The issue will have reservation of 1.3 crore shares for SBI shareholders and 18.6 lakh shares for employees. Eligible employees are entitled to a discount of Rs 75 per share.

According to SBI Card MD Hardayal Prasad , the company has a market share of 18% in terms of number of cards and spend. “We are the only card issuer that is not part of a bank. This gives us a tremendous advantage in issuing white-label cards on behalf of other banks,” said Prasad. He said there was a threefold growth opportunity with customers making more payments on the e-platform, increasing propensity to avail credit for consumption and low penetration of cards in India.

According to Dinesh Khara , MD, SBI while technically it was possible for the company to become the largest issuer in three months given SBI’s Card base, the focus was on ensuring that the base was profitable. He said that the bank did not charge the card company for issue of cards to its customers. “We are doing it as a mutually complementary exercise as we get to enlarge our product bouquet. We endeavour to do this by running algorithms on our customer database,” said Khara.

Kolkatans take refuge under umbrellas and in raincoats on Tuesday

KOLKATA: A thick cloud cover and intermittent drizzles brought the mercury down by five degrees in Kolkata on Tuesday. The maximum temperature plunged to 22.6°C, eight notches below normal. With a cyclonic circulation that triggered the rain still looming, the rain could continue till late Wednesday afternoon, predicted weathermen at the Met office.

However, the showers will never be intense since the circulation, which reached Bihar on Tuesday afternoon, is set to move towards north Bengal. On Tuesday, Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 18.8°C and received 1mm rain.

“The drizzles and the cloud brought the day temperature down. Since the cloud cover will persist, along with the occasional drizzle, the minimum temperature will not rise significantly. It could be around 20°C on Wednesday,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das, adding, “Till another system forms and leads to a cloud cover and rain, the mercury will keep rising.”

The north Bengal districts of Malda, South and North Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Siliguri and Darjeeling received moderate rain. With the circulation moving towards the region, the rain could intensify early on Wednesday. “But it will gradually lose intensity as the circulation moves away. The mercury will start rising on Thursday and will steadily climb towards the 30°C-mark,” added Das.

Last week, the city had turned warm with the maximum temperature crossing 30°C for the first time this season. It was attributed to the disappearance of the chilly northwesterly wind. The Met office had predicted the drop in temperature after it spotted the cyclonic circulation over Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

INDORE: Better late than never. Decade-old plan to streamline traffic at Jawahar Marg may soon make its way from shelved files of IMC storeroom to reality.

The project of building a flyover that could not see the light of day at that time due to objections by local traders and politicians has been taken up by Indore divisional commissioner Akash Tripathi, who exercising his power delegated as IMC administrator, ordered a survey for constructing flyover on Jawahar Marg connecting Bhagat Singh Square at Rajmohalla to Sardar Patel Bridge via Sanjay Setu.

Tripathi’s instruction is said to be very important to deal with congested traffic problems on this road by sidelining objections raised by senior BJP leaders including then education minister Laxman Singh Gaud. The divisional commissioner gave the instructions in a meeting held on Tuesday to review progress of ongoing development works and planning new projects.

To meet deadline of ongoing works, Tripathi appointed in charge official for each projects like completing a bridge at Kulkarni Ka Bhatta by June 15, Sarwate bus stand and Gandhi Hall restoration works by end of June. He also emphasized on restoration of Nehru Park and completing ongoing works of Vishram Bagh and Chhota Nehru Stadium as soon as possible. The commissioner set a deadline of completing ongoing cleaning and beautification of Kanh and Saraswati by March-end.

The commissioner also reviewed ongoing road widening works between Gangwal and Sarwate bus stands, MG Road and Subhash Marg and issued required instructions to complete them.

During the meet, he asked officials to explore possibilities to legalize illegal colonies and take appropriate actions on colonizers, who failed to deliver basic amenities to residents as per standard. He reiterated to start construction of a four-lane road between Bhawarkuan Square and Tejaji Nagar Square soon along with developing service road alongside bypass.

Sushil Kumar Modi

PATNA: The Budget speech by deputy CM and finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi in the state assembly on Tuesday set the NDA agenda of campaign for the assembly election scheduled in October-November this year.

Modi harped on 15 years of Lalu Prasad-Rabri Devi rule versus 15 years of Nitish Kumar-led NDA’s governance in the state. He highlighted the atrocities on Dalits with a special mention of mass massacres since 1990, before Nitish took the reins in 2005.

Reacting to the budget, the former principal of Patna College and retired professor of economics, Nawal Kishore Chaudhary, said, “It was a propaganda budget with little branding as green budget talking about environment and water resources.”

He told TOI: “The budget speech was like the government’s campaign manifesto. The state’s budget should be about the government’s vision and plans for the next fiscal. What is the purpose of enumerating the number of medical and polytechnic colleges when there are no teachers? The focus on Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Mission is a welcome move, but it also reflects the government’s failure on water resources front. The budget lacks vision.”

Modi, in his speech dwelt at length on the NDA government’s achievements such as 35% reservation for women in state jobs, 15 medical colleges in 15 years and revival of dying boards and corporations as opposed to the lack of development during the Lalu-Rabri rule.

Former state finance minister and senior RJD leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui termed it as a “copy and paste budget”. He said the Nitish government has been trumpeting the increased budget allocations every year and compares that to pre-2005 state budgets, but the finance minister never reveals how much funds lapse every year.

“They don’t mention the budget of other developed states of the country in the pre-2005 period. They also don’t tell that the budget size has been increased due to more central assistance over the years, as has been the case with other states as well. The present budget has neither vision nor road map or even proper homework,” he told TOI.

While presenting the Rs2,11,761.49 crore budget, SuMo said it has increased eight times compared to Rs 23,885 crore in 2004- 05.

Suresh Khanna

LUCKNOW: Parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna locked horns with Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary in assembly on Tuesday and questioned authenticity of the crime figures in last three years being mentioned by him.

Earlier, Samajwadi Party’s Ujjwal Raman Singh started reeling out figures to claim that crime against women had spiraled under Yogi government, and the data he was quoting was from a state government website.

He said crime cases against women, mainly dowry deaths, rapes and molestation, had gone up while they were much less in SP regime. Khanna presented figures saying crime against women was highest under SP government, and strict measures by Yogi government had brought a sharp decline.

Chaudhary challenged Khanna and said he had NCRB figures. Khanna countered saying he too had figures of same agency. “Your figures are not true and the Central government’s are correct,” Chaudhary responded, but Khanna replied saying, “Yours are photocopies while mine are original,” leaving the House in splits. He said, “We should submit our papers to the chair to verify whose claim is right,” and handed him papers to be given to Speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit. Chaudhary also handed the papers to speaker.

Earlier, SP alleged that fake encounters were increasing and staged a boycott demanding a judicial inquiry.

Times View There will be some amount of dislocation because of this unavoidable work. Good planning — and cooperation from motorists and pedestrians — will be essential to maintain a semblance of order in this zone, which tends to be chaotic even at the best of times.

KOLKATA: Pedestrians bound for BB Ganguly Street will get a new pathway out of Sealdah station soon while vehicles — especially those carrying goods — will have to take the longer route via BR Singh Hospital. The new traffic plan has been formed since the BB Ganguly Street stretch between Sealdah flyover and Sealdah court will remain shut for around two years to facilitate East-West Metro tunnelling.KMRCL has sought cops’ help to manage traffic here since the tunnel boring machine (TBM) is set to arrive within three-five months.The Sealdah traffic guard and KMRCL carried out a survey of the area after tunnelling restarted at Bowbazar. “For now, we have taken three important decisions. No vehicle or pedestrian will be allowed under the Sealdah flyover from the station and vice versa. From the station, cars will have to go via BR Singh Hospital and get on the flyover to approach BB Ganguly Street. The only exception will be the KMC conservancy trucks that enter the station complex early in the morning to clear garbage. “Given the importance of this operation, KMRCL will marshal these vehicles,” said a police source.The new pedestrian walkway is being created on the northern part of the station complex, close to the VIP parking. From there, the people can move towards Santosh Mitra Square and Muchipara police station,” said an officer.The traffic police are also worried about the dispersal of vehicles from the station. “There is a possibility that the Metro workers might need a deck span of around 45m to complete work near BR Singh Hospital. However, with KMRCL agreeing to complete work in two phases, cops are certain that traffic flow will not be affected too much.But there may be snarls near Sealdah flyover towards the approach to BR Singh Hospital. “With movement to Koley Market affected, it will be a logistical challenge. We are hoping none of the agencies decide to shut any part of the flyover at that point of time,” said an officer.“We will depute a dedicated team near Sealdah court to guide pedestrians and regulate vehicles entering the station premises. A new traffic signal is being put in place along with a temporary boom barrier,” said an officer from Sealdah traffic guard.Sources on the ground, though, said managing thousands of pedestrians will be a tough task. “We have already had people challenging the diversion. Several have claimed they will continue using BB Ganguly Street. Unless we can channel everyone on to dedicated lanes, our plan will not see success,” said an officer when TOI visited the spot on Tuesday.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74310217,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-745598,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/e-w-work-bb-ganguly-sealdah-stretch-to-stay-shut-for-2-years/articleshow/74309091.cms

Chennai: Coronavirus has brought down the yarn exports to China to almost nil. The country, which imports over a quarter (27%) of India’s cotton yarn appears shut for yarn business.

Exporters said that February so far has seen a 20%-30% drop in overall exports because of the inactivity in China.

“Compared to January, there is a 40% drop in overall exports and almost nil exports to China. However, there is demand from Bangladesh and Vietnam who usually import yarn from China. So the situation has been salvaged a bit,” said Arun Jhajaria, director of Salona Cotspin.

As a result of low demand, cotton yarn prices have fallen by 3%- 4% to Rs 185 to Rs 200 per kilogram, for export quality in the past 10 days. After the lunar new year, Chinese come forward to purchase the yarn but exporters add that business has not yet picked up.

In FY 2020, yarn exports were already down by 9% for the period April to Jan. The industry saw an improvement in exports from November after seeing a drop of upto 39%. “We saw a revival of exports in November and December and now, with the factories shut, we expect to see a drop in exports again,” said KV Srinivasan, chairman of industry body TEXPROCIL.

Adar Poonawalla (File photo)

MUMBAI: Billionaire vaccine maker Cyrus Poonawalla’s son Adar has made his maiden investment in India’s food service sector by acquiring a stake in Sweetish House Mafia , a cookie speciality cafe, founded by former investment banker Neha Sethi and her brother-in-law.

A few years ago, Adar, CEO of Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, had acquired a stake in Pune’s Ritz-Carlton hotel. He has invested about Rs 12 crore in Sweetish House Mafia, which was started in 2013 with Neha, a self-trained baker, selling cookies in a Tata Nano at pop-up locations in Mumbai.

A year-and-a-half later, the partners set up the first brick-and-mortar store in Lower Parel , a business district in Mumbai. Currently, there are 12 outlets across big cities.

“The funds will be used to strengthen our presence in existing geographies as well as to enter new cities,” said co-founder Akash Sethi . “Some part of the money will be also deployed to expand our range of gourmet cookies.” The cookie business in India, worth Rs 14,500 crore, is growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 10%.

The Sethis are also planning to launch an e-commerce platform. “The coming decade will be dominated by direct-to-consumer brands. And investors are looking for models that stay relevant to consumers,” said an industry observer.

The food service sector has attracted over $3 billion of venture capital (VC) and private equity money in 12 years, according to a 2019 report by National Restaurant Association of India. Recent months saw VC firm RB investing in homegrown QSR chain Burger Singh and Tiger Global in Wow! Momo Foods. In 2017, ICICI Ventures invested Rs 100 crore in Theobroma Foods, a patisserie chain and a competitor of Sweetish House Mafia.

PATNA: A debt-ridden couple committed suicide by hanging themselves from ceiling after killing their minor son at their rented accommodation in Katihar town on Tuesday.

The victims were identified as Manish Kumar (42), his wife Mona Kumari (35) and their three-year-old son Samrat.

Katihar SP (incharge) Aditya Kumar said Manish was a businessman and Mona a social worker. “The two have left a four-page suicide note stating that they took the extreme step after failing to repay a loan of Rs 30 lakh,” the SP said, adding the incident probably took place on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday.

The SP said preliminary investigations suggested that the couple poisoned their son and hanged themselves to death. “Manish and Mona were found hanging from a rope tied to a hook fixed in the ceiling,” he said, adding Manish had tried his luck in different businesses, including television and mobile sales. “He had taken loan from several people,” the SP said.

69,['26/02/2020'],Traffic jam: Vehicle numbers vroomed from 5 million to 303 million in 40 years,"This story is from February 26, 2020

CHENNAI: There’s a reason for the bumper-to-bumper traffic on Indian roads. The number of registered vehicles in the country has risen from a mere 5.4 million units in 1981 to a staggering nearly 303 million units in 2019, a rise of 5500%.

This includes cars, SUVs, taxies, tractors, buses, two and three-wheelers, trucks and people carriers. Just cars, SUVs and taxis on Indian roads has gone up by almost 40 times in nearly 40 years. Based on SIAM stats, estimates put the total number of registered passenger vehicles in 1981 at 1.2 million units. This went up to just over 10 million in 2005 and 40 million in 2019. The exponential increase in cars shows the impact a scrappage policy might have both on the environment as well as on the health of the auto industry, say auto consultants.

India’s two-wheeler population has gone from 2.6 million units to 228 million units in just under 40 years. Most of this spurt has happened in the last 15 years or so. The two wheeler park went from almost 59 million in 2005 to 169 million in 2016. In contrast, the number of buses plying on Indian roads have gone up from 0.2 million units to 1.5 million units in the last nearly 40 years. The number of goods vehicles have gone up too but not as much as personal vehicles — in 39 years the population has gone from 0.6 million units to 11.4 million units. Other categories which include tractors, trailers, three-wheelers etc have also gone up — from 0.9 million units to nearly 22 million units in the same period.

Currently, there are about 3 million registered commercial vehicles (buses and good vehicles) on the roads which are more than 15-years-old. According to a report by equity research firm Dart , the total registered vehicles between 1991 to 2005 include 7.37 million passenger vehicles, 45 million two wheelers, 0.56 million buses and 2.68 million trucks/goods vehicles. “While the government has been talking only of commercial vehicle scrappage, industry has been asking for scrappage of all older vehicles including cars and two wheelers. The extent to which the older vehicles will be weeded out will depend upon whether the scrappage will be mandatory or voluntary. If it is voluntary, the impact may not be that big.,” said Ashish Modani , VP, ICRA.

71,['26/02/2020'],‘Insufficient’ allocation draws flak from some,"This story is from February 26, 2020

PATNA: Even as the state government has given priority to education in its annual budget this year with the highest allocation of Rs 35,000 crore, the budget presented by finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Monday evoked mixed reactions from academics.

While some appreciated the government’s initiative for improving the academic scenario of the state, others criticized the budget, saying it “failed to meet the people’s aspirations”.

Patna University economics department former head Nawal Kishore Chaudhary said, “The budgetary allocation for higher education is not sufficient to ensure its proper growth and development. Although there is emphasis on ‘Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’, schoolteachers are not getting adequate salaries. Lakhs of them are already on strike to press their demand for better salaries in the state.”

Chaudhary further observed that there was no concrete proposal for developing the higher education system in the state. “The universities are suffering from acute scarcity of teachers and other ministerial staff, but the budget does not speak a word about their appointment. There is no talk of opening any new university or research centre. The government has not announced any new development proposal for 103-year-old Patna University even when the Centre has already turned down its request for its take over,” he added.

Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar working president Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha told this newspaper, “If the state’s GDP has increased to 15%, there should have been a corresponding increase in the budgetary allocation for higher education. How will the government fulfil its own commitment of enhancing the gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher education to 30% by 2030, if it does not provide for any new college or university in the state in the coming fiscal.”

Sinha also pointed out that more than three lakh students of the state, who had passed Intermediate examinations from the state last year could not get admission to graduation courses due to lack of colleges. “This year, even a greater number of youths will be deprived of higher education opportunities as the number of Inter examinees has increased. Neither has the government announced any new scheme for improving the system of higher education nor has it initiated any step for strengthening the state council for higher education,” he added.

However, Patna College sociology department head and Patna University Teachers’ Association president Randhir Kumar Singh hailed the state budget, which “aims at greater infrastructural development in the education sector”. “The government decision to set up at least one polytechnic for women in each district is praiseworthy as it will enhance job potential for them,” he said.

Patna Science College geology (honours) student Saurabh also welcomed the budget and hoped that with the strengthening of various student-centric measures initiated by the Nitish Kumar-government the higher education scenario would improve.

BHAGALPUR: People of Bhagalpur region have evoked mixed response to the state budget presented by finance minister and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi in the assembly on Tuesday for the financial year 20020-21.

Residents, however, hailed the announcement of free certification to promote ‘organic farming’ which may lend support to farmers opting for organic farming in the region. Teachers and students of the Bihar Agricultural University (BAU), Sabour, besides farmers expressed satisfaction over the announcement of ‘Pratibha Samman’ to promote quality researches in agriculture universities and institutions in the state.

The netizens also hailed the announcement for constructing new hostels in state-run engineering colleges, polytechniques etc besides announcement of free dialysis for patients suffering from kidney-related diseases under PM’s Free National Dialysis Programme at all the district hospitals and others.

General secretary of the Eastern Bihar Industries Association (EBIA) Alok Agarwal said that except for earlier announced Khadi Park, Handloom & Silk Bhavan, Software Park, Migratory Birds’ Ringing and Monitoring Station in Bhagalpur, which has been reiterated again, nothing specific for Bhagalpur region has been announced.

“Long-pending issues concerning Central University at Bhagalpur, archaeological excavations at Vikramshila and Karnagarh etc. do not find any mention in this budget,” lamented Agarwal adding, “Nothing much has been done to give an impetus to business of building construction and real estate. Allocation of 0.43% to industries speaks volumes about the state government’s apathy towards industrialization.”

“There are no schemes in the budget for industries related to maize, banana, sugarcane, tassar silk etc of Bhagalpur region. The state government should make region specific industrial planning and promote agro-industries besides others,” a trader associated with the silk industry said.

“Few of the locals told police that a woman suddenly started crossing the highway from the middle and the bus veered off the road while trying to save her. However, according to the passengers, the driver failed to control the speed of the bus which resulted in the accident,” he said adding, “The bus driver fled from the scene after the accident.”

By Chaitanya Sreenivas

Ever since ‘personnel administration’ came into being in the 1900s, it has continuously evolved, more so in the last decade. Now human resources (HR) no longer pertains to merely hiring, assessing & compensating employees, but is intrinsic in achieving the business goals of an organisation.

Emerging technologies that disrupted traditional business models have permeated HR too. Technology is becoming vital to HR as it moves closer to business and HR leaders expect it to play a strategic role. Among the emerging technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) signals an HR technology step change, as it can create an impact across the entire talent management life cycle.

AI across talent management life cycle

An organisation can apply AI in almost any area of HR, be it to attract & hire candidates or to engage, retain & develop skills of current employees.

AI tools can pinpoint high-potential candidates even before they apply for a job. With specialised chatbots, AI — powered by natural language processing — can help attract talent by enabling prospective candidates to learn more about the organisation and answer any other queries they have. Thus, enhancing the candidate’s experience during the ‘attract’ phase.

AI can enable efficient and effective recruitment by predicting the time taken to fill a vacancy by analysing historical data. So, recruiters can prioritise the open positions they need to fill and do not hastily hire the wrong candidates.

It can also predict the future performance of a candidate by analysing the data submitted in the job application, resume and job requisition. Moreover, AI can assist in putting together more inclusive job descriptions and filter candidates minimising unintended bias in the recruitment process.

During the ‘engage’ phase, AI offers two important use cases — talent alerts and engagement analysis. AI talent alerts are essentially notifications for first-line managers that provide insights about their team members by sifting through employee data available within the organisation. AI engagement analysis is a technology that analyses unstructured data from employee surveys and social media chatter within a corporate firewall. At the ‘retain’ phase, AI can aid in smarter compensation planning. HR teams need to consider several factors like market rate for different skill sets, the demand for these skills and the approach to reward performance in base pay or bonus.

Above all, AI can accelerate skill development at individual employee-level while optimising learning at the organisation-level. The most promising aspect of AI deployment is in the real-time inference of skills. AI-based skills inference can support organisations in spotting high-potential employees.

Today, most of the innovation-led organisations are using AI to mitigate biases and enhance diversity & inclusion (D&I).

AI as a tool to alleviate bias and bolster D&I

In any organisation, several types of biases tend to creep in due to a variety of reasons, whether consciously or subconsciously.

Cognitive biases happen when employees allow systematic irrational judgments into their thinking and reasoning. In such cases, they may indulge in stereotyping, confirmation bias (tendency to search or interpret information in a way that confirms one’s preconceptions) or self-serving bias (propensity to blame external factors for failure and claim credit for success).

Bias in everyday work life could manifest into micro-aggression where employees resort to verbal or non-verbal slights and hostile communication due to bias against gender, ethnicity or disability. Whatever be the reasons, biases prevent an organisation from building a truly diverse and inclusive workplace. Mitigating these biases is crucial for organisations to ensure compliance and foster an environment of innovation and healthy competition wherein employees can grow.

This is where AI plays a role. Unlike human beings, machines do not suffer from inherent biases, but are subject to the choices of data and algorithmic features chosen by the people building them.

AI can remove the attributes that lead to biases. It can also learn how to detect potential biases, particularly those unconscious ones that are unintentional and hard to uncover in the decision-making processes. AI can ensure the right-fit candidates have equal access to job opportunities and support HR in making fair hiring decisions.

Road map to imbue AI in HR

Before an organisation introduces AI into its HR system, it can start with identifying the business case. What are the business problems they intend to solve? Who are the people who need this problem solved, and will they commit to it in their profit & loss reporting? Then the business case should spell out the minimum viable product (MVP).

The next step is for the organisation to decide if it can build its own AI applications or procure them off-the-shelf. Irrespective of whether it decides to buy or build, deploying AI capability in the cloud is the best way forward. An organisation should remember that the faster it deploys the MVP, the sooner it can deliver the next improved iteration.

Finally, if the MVP rollout is successful, it should contemplate enterprise-wide adoption by leveraging design thinking and agile working models.

If an organisation wants to test the waters and not commit to using AI, chatbots can be a starting point. HR can choose a process that generates many questions from employees and deploy a chatbot based on a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs). Chatbots are inexpensive and non-technical HR staff can manage them.

The bottom line is that ‘strategic HR’ has to come into the play wherein the focus moves from administrative practices to high-performance HR practices concentrated on key jobs and groups of workers. AI has a substantial role to play in making HR strategic and, fortunately for CHROs, it has become more accessible.

75,['26/02/2020'],Binny Bansal backs online gold loan co Rupeek,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Bengaluru: Rupeek , a five-year-old startup that helps consumers get loans against gold, has raised another $35 million in funding from Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal , US and China-based venture capital firm GGV Capital, Korea’s KB Investments and Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy-backed Tanglin Venture Partners.

The investment will take the valuation of Rupeek, which operates through a branchless model of home pick-up and drop-off, to over $300 million. The latest round will take the total capital raised by Rupeek to about $70-75 million, with early backers including Sequoia Capital India and Accel India .

The startup is expected to disburse loans of about $28 million this month and plans to further accelerate this in 2020. The startup will use the capital to expand from 10 cities to 30, brand building, setting up data science team and invest in its hardware product which assesses the quality of gold. The startup was set up in 2015 by Sumit Maniyar, an IIT-Bombay alumnus, who had earlier co-founded ed-tech startup Function Space besides working at JP Morgan and Religare.

“Gold loans serve as overdraft or credit card for self-employed borrowers or even the salaried class, who can’t either get the quantum of loans or have the right credit score,” said Maniyar. The startup works with banks and NBFCs that are not active or don’t have the capabilities in the gold loan segment, leveraging their balance sheet to lend. This gives these financial institutes ability to expand into a market without opening own branches and network, while also allowing Rupeek to lend at a rate which is “25-40% lower as compared to NBFCs”, said Maniyar.

Rupeek also has its own NBFC, which it primarily uses to try new products or launch in new markets, while about 95% of the loan book is through its partners. India’s gold loan market is expected to reach Rs 4.6 lakh crore by 2022, growing at a compounded rate of 13.4%, according to a recent KPMG report.

The sector has seen several NBFCs like Muthoot and Manappuram Finance, which have built a loan book of billions of dollars. “I am excited about how Rupeek is opening up access to formal credit for a large base of users. Their strong customer proposition and approach of partnering with banks is truly a game-changer for the unorganised gold loans space in India,” said Bansal, who is also setting up a $300-400 million venture capital fund to invest in startups. Bansals other fintech investments include general insurance player Acko.

76,['26/02/2020'],Patna drenched in untimely downpour,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Passengers of e-rickshaw try to protects themselves from rainfall in Patna on Tuesday.

PATNA: An untimely downpour led to waterlogging and traffic jam in several localities of the city on Tuesday. Commuters were stuck in traffic jam for hours at several places.

Since several roads were dug up for laying underground water pipelines, electric and phone wires as well as construction of drains, it added to the woes of people. Rainwater inundated roads in several low-lying areas of the city, such as Rajendra Nagar, Kadamkuan, Patliputra, Patna Junction and Thakurbari.

Mukesh Kumar, a motorist, said parts of Ashok Rajpath and its approach roads were dug up for laying gas pipeline. “The rain complicated the situation. The traffic police personnel were nowhere to be seen when the motorists were trying to negotiate the waterlogged roads,” he added.

Ashwini Kunwer, a resident of Bank Road, said some motorists nearly met accident near Gandhi Market and Judges Court Road.

Surabhi, a resident of Rajendra Nagar road number 12, said the agencies concerned did not repair roads at several places after completing civic work.

Patna mayor Sita Sahu said the agencies concerned did not take permission from the municipal body before digging up the roads in the city. “The Patna commissioner had instructed the companies to take permission from Patna Municipal Corporation and road construction department before digging up roads. They, however, dug the roads at their will and filled the wholes with debris. Action will be taken against these agencies for causing inconvenience to people,” she added.

The mayor said the civic body was trying to pump out rainwater from the affected areas.

77,['26/02/2020'],"40,000 high school, higher secondary teachers go on indefinite strike in Bihar","This story is from February 26, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: Around 40,000 contractual teachers of government-run secondary and higher secondary schools in the state went on indefinite strike on Tuesday in support of their three-point charter of demands, including creation of service condition for them.

The strike, organised by Bihar State Secondary Teachers’ Association (BSSTA), means the teachers will boycott evaluation of Intermediate answer sheets. The Intermediate exams were conducted by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) between February 3 and 13 and the answer sheets are to be evaluated from Wednesday.

BSSTA president Kedarnath Pandey said the teachers selected for evaluation duty were supposed to collect the joining letter from their respective schools. “The contractual teachers, however, did not collect the letters. They also did not conduct academic activities on Tuesday,” he said.

Pandey said the BSSTA’s three key demands are sparing teachers from non-academic activities, removal of discrepancies in disbursement of salary and creation of service condition for contractual teachers. “The teachers will continue the strike till the government accepts their three demands,” he added.

Pandey said academic activities were not carried out at 6,200 secondary and higher secondary schools in state on Tuesday. At many schools, the teachers locked the gates.

Ashutosh, mathematics teacher at Patna-based Raghunath Balika High School, said he did not collect joining letter for evaluation work from Patna Collegiate.

Raghuvendra Kumar, a contractual teacher at B P High School in Begusarai, none joined work at four evaluation centres in the district. “Academic activities remained virtually suspended at 84 high schools in the district,” he claimed.

Mukesh Kumar, a teacher at K B Sahay School, Patna, said some regular teachers were trying to conduct regular activities in schools.

Education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma said the government would initiate action against agitating teachers if they boycott evaluation duty.

Thiruvananthapuram: The registrations department has launched mega adalat scheme wherein all the undervalued documents will be excluded from further legal action after giving an opportunity for a one-time settlement .

In the adalats, such documents will be excluded after remitting 30% of the undervalued sum. The adalats will be held at all the sub-registrar offices till March 5. Those who have not received the notice, can identify whether their documents have been categorized under undervalued documents from the website of the registrations department.

Jasti Krishna Kishore

HYDERABAD: Senior Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer Jasti Krishna Kishore got a relief on Tuesday when the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Hyderabad, set aside his suspension and sent him back to his parent wing of income-tax department.

The AP government suspended Kishore in December last year over allegations of irregularities during his tenure as CEO of the Andhra Pradesh Economic Development Board (APEDB).

A bench comprising tribunal chairman Justice L Narasimha Reddy and member BV Sudhakar gave this verdict after hearing a plea filed by Kishore. The bench, however, made it clear that the AP government was free to pursue the criminal cases it had filed against the IRS officer in accordance with law.

The bench said the suspension was illegal and set aside the order of Kishore’s suspension. The bench also agreed with the argument of senior counsel Neeraj Malhotra who said his client may not get any relief even if the tribunal directs the state government to repatriate Krishna to the Centre since the state may not implement such an order. The tribunal directed Kishore to join his parent wing and a direction was issued to the Centre to take him back.Kishore was an I-T commissioner and part of a team that assessed the accounts of Jagathi Publications, a firm owned by AP chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy. It was based on the findings of this team, CBI officials concluded that the share value of Jagathi was artificially inflated during 2008-09.

Kishore was made APEDB CEO in September 2015 by the then Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP government. Though his deputation from the Centre ended in 2018, it was extended for three more years.

In May 2019 when Jagan came to power, Kishore urged both the Centre and the state government to send him back to his parent wing. However, citing financial irregularities, the AP government refused to repatriate him and transferred him to the secretariat. It attached him to the general administration department (GAD) without giving him any posting. Apart from suspending Kishore, it ordered ACB and CID probes against him to enquire into the alleged deeds of financial misappropriation committed by him. It also asked him to not leave Amaravati without its permission. Following a plea, the tribunal had stayed the suspension order some time back and even found fault with the government’s decision to transfer him to GAD. “By making him an ex-officio secretary, you (government) brought him under your administrative control. Can you do this? Do you possess such powers? You did this only to suspend him,” the bench had fumed at the state counsel in one of the hearings.

82,['26/02/2020'],MSEDCL restores supply to Latur purification plants,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Representative image

AURANGABAD: Not scarcity, but power bill dues deprived Latur residents of water supply for the past 18 days.

Latur residents usually get water supply once in 10 days from the Manjara dam. The water levels in the dam have already hit dead storage, because of which the civic body is pumping water for supply. The Latur Municipal Corporation has not paid the electricity bills totalling Rs 1.8 crore to the irrigation department since September 2019.

Around 10 days back, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Corporation Ltd ( MSEDCL ) disconnected the power supply to the water purification plants at Harangul, Nagzari, Sai and Varvanti in Latur city in a bid to recover the dues.

MSEDCL superintending engineer N Mane said the Latur municipal corporation has not paid its power bills since September 2019. The disconnection of power was aimed at recovery of dues, he said.

On Tuesday, the Latur municipal corporation made partial payment to the power utility and the supply is expected to be restored.

Latur mayor Vikrant Gojamgunde said the power bills for two months (September and October 2019) have been paid to the MSEDCL. “The corporation has paid Rs 67 lakh to the power distribution company. The power connection to the water purification plants has resumed. We have started pumping water from Tuesday afternoon,” he said.

Gojamgunde added that the dam receives water only in October. So, in order to ensure that current stock lasts till October 2020, the water is being supplied to the city in a 10-day cycle, he said.

He added that the MSEDCL also has dues payable to the Latur civic body worth crores. “They had conducted underground cabling work in 2018 for which they have to pay us Rs 1 crore and they have outstanding property tax dues of Rs 30 lakh. They should avoid disconnecting power to essential services like water supply system,” he said.

The power supply disconnection took a political turn on Monday when BJP corporators and workers held a protest at the municipal corporation office. While the BJP is in the majority in the civic body, the mayor is from Congress. Gojamgunde said that he was elected as mayor only two months back, while the power bills are pending for the last six months. “The dues will be cleared soon,” he told TOI.

Indore: Madhya Pradesh government on Tuesday exempted state goods and service tax for three months on upcoming Taapasee Pannu-starrer film ‘ Thappad ’. The film delves in effects of domestic violence.

Commercial tax department issued a circular, asking single-screen cinemas and multiplexes to refrain from collecting SGST on tickets of the film directed by Anubhav Sinha scheduled to be released on February 28. The tax will be exempted till May 27.

At present, film tickets carry 18 percent GST -- SGST and central goods and services tax at nine per cen each.

Pannu has played the character of Amrita, an upper-middle class woman, who objects to domestic violence at early stage of her marriage and files for a divorce after she was slapped by her husband at a party. In January, the government had declared ‘Chhapaak’ featuring Deepika Padukone as tax free.

Nashik: The city units of the Congress and BJP on Tuesday staged dharnas in front of the district collectorate on different issues.

The Congress camp staged a protest against the alleged conspiracy by BJP to do away with reservations for SCs, STs and other backward classes. The party functionaries submitted a memorandum to the district authorities demanding that the BJP-led government at the Centre and different states continue with the reservation policy.

“The BJP government in Uttarakhand recently argued before the Supreme Court that reservations were not a fundamental right as per the Constitution. This led the apex court to give a verdict which could have a negative fallout of reservation rights of the deprived sections of society,” stated the Congress memorandum.

The Congress leaders alleged that when the issue was raised in the parliament the ruling-party misled the house on the issue. The party reminded BJP that it was imperative to continue with the reservation policy to ameliorate the plight of the oppressed class of the society.

On the other hand, BJP organised the agitation alleging that the present Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has failed to fulfill its promises to the farmers.

The party also submitted a memorandum to the district authorities on the issue. “The loan waiver scheme announced by the MVA government for farmers is not adequate. The government when it came to power had announced a total waiver of loans for all farmers. But the scheme that was announced will not solve the woes of the farmers,” alleged the BJP leader accusing Shiv Sena of deceiving BJP to form a government with Congress and NCP.

According to the BJP leaders, the MVA government has failed to fulfill the promises to the people of the state after it came to power.

86,['26/02/2020'],Several TRS leaders line up for RS berth,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Hyderabad: The Election Commission on Tuesday released an election schedule to fill Rajya Sabha seat vacancies across the country, including two in Telangana. Two MPs — KVP Ramachandra Rao and Garikapati Mohan Rao — are retiring in April.

The ruling TRS is likely to secure both the seats as the opposition parties do not have enough numbers. TRS secretary general K Keshava Rao is also retiring in April, but as a member of Andhra Pradesh since he was allotted to AP during bifurcation of the state.

TRS sources said party president K Chandrasekhar Rao will take a call on the candidates in the first week of March after Pattana Pragathi programme concludes on March 4.

While over a dozen leaders are vying for the MP seats, sources said one candidate who would go to the Upper House will be either former Nizamabad MP Kalvakuntla Kavitha or planning board vice-chairman B Vinod Kumar.

Presently, TRS has six MPs in the elders’ House. Though D Srinivas is still technically with TRS, he does not enjoy good relations with the party leadership.

A notification for the elections will be issued on March 6 and last date for receiving nominations is March 13. While polling will be held on March 26 between 9 am and 4 pm, counting will be taken up on the same day at 5 pm.

Bareilly: Live monitoring of the final exams of the colleges affiliated to Mahatma Jyotiba Phule (MJP) Rohilkhand University was affected on the very first day, on Tuesday, said sources here. They said slow speed of internet hindered monitoring through webcasting of nearly 40% of the exam centres at these colleges in the second shift.

The annual exams are being conducted in a total of 322 exam centres across nine districts of Bareilly and Moradabad divisions. The exams are being conducted in three shifts -- 7 am to 10 am, 11 am to 2 pm and 3 pm to 6 pm. To monitor live proceedings at these exam centres and to keep a check on use of unfair means, two control rooms have been set up in Bareilly -- on the campus of MJP Rohilkhand University and regional higher education office, respectively. The monitoring has to be done from 6.45 am to 8 pm.

However, officials said the monitoring of around 40% of centres was affected, when the internet speed slowed down in the second shift. However, after the staff deployed at the control room asked the incharge of these exam centres to improve internet connectivity for better monitoring, the internet speed increased in the third shift, said officials.

Regional higher education officer Rajesh Prakash said, “It has come to the fore that a few exam centres in Bareilly, Budaun and Moradabad did not share their IP address with us for monitoring the exam proceedings through webcasting. We have issued a warning to these centres and have decided to deploy an observer here to check use of unfair means during the exams.”

He added, “After it came to my notice that invigilators at a few centres were not carrying identity cards, which is against the guidelines, we have issued a warning to them.”

Exam controller Sanjeev Kumar said, “We will ask incharge of the exam centres to ensure proper internet speed throughout the exam time. Besides, no case of use of unfair means during the exams was reported.”

A total of 4.57 lakh students have been registered for appearing in the final exams of MJP Rohilkhand University. Of the total 4.57 lakh, 3.33 lakh are regular students while 1.23 lakh are private students. Besides, five teams of flying squads have been constituted.

Kozhikode: A delegation from the University of Calicut (CU) along with its officials from Lakshadweep will hold talks with the University Grants Commission (UGC) to ensure that the validity of certificates issued by the varsity to the students studying at three CU centres in the Union territory is not affected by the UGC rules regarding territorial jurisdiction of varsities.

The decision was taken at a meeting held by CU officials with its Lakshwadeep administration and MP Mohammad Faizal PP over the last two days.

Varsity registrar C L Joshy, who was also part of the delegation that held the meeting in Lakshwadeep said CU has been the main higher education provider of Lakshadweep for the last four decades and the islands have been the operational area of the varsity for all practical purposes. However, the varsity has not been formally included in the Lakshadweep islands under its geographical jurisdiction.

As per UGC policy, a university established or incorporated by or under a State Act shall operate only within the territorial jurisdiction allotted to it under its act and in no case beyond the territory of the state of its location. The Lakshadweep administration had recently written to the varsity about the UGC approval of the courses being conducted at the Calicut University centres in Lakshadweep over possible jurisdictional issues.

“We decided that a delegation from the varsity along with the MP of Lakshadweep would meet the UGC next month to apprise them that the varsity has been operating in the Union territory for the last four decades as its main higher education provider. Though there is no reason for concern at the moment, we want to make sure that the jurisdictional issues don’t pose any threat and want to establish that the islands have been part of the operational area of the varsity,” he added.

The Lakshwadeep officials also raised concern about low pass percentage in PG courses offered by the varsity centres but for MSc Aqua Culture. Varsity officials said they would rethink on whether to continue post graduate courses like MSc Mathematics, MA Arabic and MCom which have been witnessing low pass percentage. “We are planning to do a rethink on whether to continue the courses with low pass percentage from next year,” Joshy added. Also, the varsity authorities told the Lakshadweep officials that they would consider introducing integrated four-year B Ed courses.

The varsity delegation also comprised syndicate members K K Haneefa and Tom K Thomas.

Calicut university has been running three centres in Lakshadweep, located at the islands of Andrott, Kadamat and College of Education situated at Kavaratti where around 1,000 students are studying.

AHMEDABAD: After a sharp rise in gold prices that breached the Rs 45,000-mark on Monday, touching a new record high, the yellow metal prices fell once again on Tuesday. Pure gold price settled at Rs 44,100 per 10 gram on Tuesday in the Ahmedabad market, sliding by Rs 950 in just a day. Analysts said that gold prices declined in the international market, because of which they plunged in the local markets as well.

“Safe haven investments by global investors went up in the past few days, amid growing worries over coronavirus outbreak in other countries, due to which gold prices went up in the international markets, as they opened on Monday. However, owing to profit-booking by investors, prices showed a decline a day later on Tuesday,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).

Due to rising gold prices, the demand for physical gold has shown a sharp decline in the local markets, said bullion traders as well as jewellers.

“The market is in the worst possible condition at this point and even the ongoing wedding season has failed to revive demand for physical gold. High prices are hurting the customers and impacting purchases. The wedding season will soon be done with and it will further hit demand severely if prices remain at the same point,” said a city-based bullion trader.

Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan along with his wife and son appear before a team of SIT (File Photo)

RAMPUR: A day after rejecting anticipatory bail pleas of Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan , wife Tanzeen Fatimah and son Abdullah Azam , who are both MLAs, and declaring them “absconders”, a local court on Tuesday ordered “confiscation of their moveable and immovable properties” in connection with a forgery case.

The accused have been chargesheeted under various sections of IPC for allegedly helping their son obtain two fake birth certificates.

In a separate case related to an alleged encroachment over enemy property by Azam Khan, additional district and sessions judge Dhirendra Kumar Kamboj had granted anticipatory bail to Azam on Monday but ordered him to surrender his passport to police and seek court’s prior permission before embarking on a foreign trip.

In September 2019, the court had issued summons to all three lawmakers, after taking cognisance of the chargesheet filed by Rampur police, in which all three have been charged with forgery and cheating. The court had directed the SHO of Ganj Kotwali police station, under whose jurisdiction the family resides, to ensure compliance of its order.

Thereafter, the court had issued non-bailable warrants against the Khans after they had failed to present themselves before it.

After the prosecution claimed that the accused were clandestinely shifting valuables from their house, on the directions of the court, police carried out an inquiry and found the charges to be true.

Following this, the court invoked section 82 of CrPC to proclaim them “absconders”. The court directed the police to comply with the proclamation notice against Azam Khan and others into the matter.

The accused have been chargesheeted under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

On January 3, 2019, local BJP leader Akash Saxena had lodged a complaint alleging that Azam and his wife helped their son in obtaining two fake birth certificates – one from Lucknow and another from Rampur – following which an FIR was registered at Ganj Kotwali.

Additional district government counsel Ram Avtar Saini said, “The court rejected the anticipatory bail applications of Azam Khan, his wife and son in three separate cases related to Abdullah's date of birth certificates, PAN cards and passport.”

Bareilly/Agra/Meerut: Leaves of all policemen were cancelled and flag march was carried out in several sensitive cities of Uttar Pradesh as the state government tried to pre-empt any attempt to disturb peace after parts of neighbouring Delhi erupted in violence leaving at least 11 dead.

Aligarh, which witnessed clashes on Sunday leaving at least 10 injured, was virtually turned into a fortress with the deployment of 13 companies of RAF and PAC. In Meerut zone’s Hapur district, the administration invoked section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), barring assembly of five or more persons.

In Bareilly, additional director general of police (ADG) Avinash Chandra went a step further and warned of use of force against unauthorised protests. “I will not let the mistake of Delhi be repeated in the UP,” the police officer warned.

Sachindra Patel, superintendent of police (SP) of Firozabad, conducted a flag march with heavy police force in sensitive parts of the district.

“After violence in the national capital, we are on high alert. The district is divided into several zones and sectors. We are carrying out flag march in sensitive parts to send a message to locals that, at no cost, peace will be allowed to be compromised. Police presence is clear warning to anti-social elements,” SP Patel said.

Police are also keeping a close eye on social media platforms. Cyber cells of every district are scanning social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp groups.

“Any post which can trigger violence will be removed immediately and action will be taken against person sharing provocative content,” added SP Firozabad.

In December last year, at least seven residents of Firozabad were killed in violence which occurred during anti-CAA protest. Most of the victims died of bullet wounds. Police maintained that not a single bullet was fired by them.

Like Firozabad, flag marches by the security personnel were carried out in Bulandshahr, Sambhal and Baghpat also.

IG of Agra range, Satish Ganesh, who was on leave after overseeing security during US President Donal Trump’s visit to city, was asked to join immediately. ADG of Agra zone, Ajay Anand said, “DGP has asked everyone to remain alert at highest level.”

ADG of Bareilly zone, Chandra held a meeting with senior policemen. During the meeting, he said, “Any protest without permission will be dealt with immediate baton-charge. Rubber bullets and tear gas could be used if required.”

The ADG further said that he won’t let “mistake like Delhi to be repeated in the state and anybody trying to stage protest inside a police station will straightaway be charged by police.”

Chandra told TOI, “I would like send a message to the protesters. Irrespective of their religion, there will be zero tolerance for unapproved protests and especially people entering the police station for staging protest like Delhi. Police will welcome them with batons.”

After intelligence inputs from security agencies, home department has instructed ADGP-rank officials to stay in sensitive area like Rampur, Moradabad, Bijnor and Sambhal and keep a close eye on law and order situation. According to sources, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath is monitoring the situation and is in continuous contact with the ADGP-ranked officials across the state.

101,['26/02/2020'],On last legs at land’s end,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Chennai: Dhanushkodi is no longer a ‘ghost town’, almost entirely wiped out by the super-cyclone of December 1964. Overrun by tourists with little knowledge of its heritage status, the abandoned settlement is hurtling towards collapse. Mainly due to apathy of a government that has allowed shops to be set up next to the fragile structures.

While the vestiges of a majestic church, a temple, a railway station, a post office and some cocoon-shaped storm shelters tell the sombre story of the tragedy that struck 55 years ago, thatched huts selling shells, trinkets and fish fry spilling over from the road onto the sands speak of neglect. The eroded train tracks jutting out of the sand, are covered with wild vegetation and trash.

The slapdash conservation of the ruins of Dhanushkodi, devastated by giant tidal waves on the intervening night of December 22 and 23, 1964, will dispel all doubts about the government’s lack of sense of tragedy and contemporary relevance of historic events. Post the 1964 tragedy, the 5km stretch from Mukuntharayar Chathiram near Rameswaram to Dhanushkodi was declared unfit for human habitation. Now, barring 200 households, descendants of earliest settlers, no one is allowed to live there. Arichamunai (‘eroded tip’) is another 4.5km away, the farthest one can go on foot.

It was only in 2017 after a new road was laid by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) that accessing Dhanushkodi became easier. Now any vehicle can reach Arichamunai. The number of visitors eager to visit the ruins of Dhanushkodi and the tip of Arichamunai has increased exponentially in the past couple of years. But the lack of preservation efforts and vision to explore the heritage potential of the area has led to further decay.

A ramshackle board, put up by the Dhanushkodi-Ram Sethu Tourist, Vendors’ Welfare Association, cautions visitors against damaging the church wall. Let alone insulating the ruins from the elements, there are no public convenience facilities and the area has turned into an open urinal and dump yard for plastic and food waste. It is as if the state is only waiting for the remains to crumble.

Tamil Nadu must immediately barricade the ruins to protect them from vandals, vendors and disruptive visitors. The adjacent stalls need to be cleared and given a dedicated stretch to carry on business. A route should be chalked out for tourists along a stretch that is a couple of kilometres long covering all the majestic ruins. A fitting way in which the structures can tell their story.

Kozhikode: With nine persons testing positive for Kyasanur Forest Disease ( KFD ), commonly known as monkey fever , in Wayanad over the past two months, the Wayanad district administration has intensified the disease prevention and surveillance activities and has asked the people to maintain vigil.

District collector Dr Adeela Abdulla said that seven KFD cases were reported last year during the same period, including two deaths, and there have been nine positive cases this year. “We are asking people from tribal colonies and those living on forest fringes to maintain vigil. People have been advised to seek medical help if they have fever or other complications,” she said.

The district collector said a joint meeting of officials from the neighbouring district across the border in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu will be convened soon to strengthen preventive measures.

A control room has been opened to monitor the disease and help people with information and support (04936 204151, toll free 1077).

District medical officer Dr R Renuka said that disease surveillance and precautionary measures have been stepped up as the KFD season which normally coincides with the summer months could extend till May. She added that all the KFD cases reported this year has been from the Thirunelly panchayat which is surrounded by forests.

“All those venturing into forest for collection of minor forest produce, wood, etc, should get themselves vaccinated,” she said.

103,['26/02/2020'],Gujarat high court denies NRI custody of son despite Dallas court ruling,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Gujarat high court

AHMEDABAD: In a custody battle for a six-year-old son between an NRI couple, the Gujarat high court rejected the father’s habeas corpus petition seeking that he be handed over the child after taking his custody from the mother.

After returning from Dallas in US having obtained a divorce, the father is at present staying in Ahmedabad and the mother lives in Valsad with the boy. The father claimed before the HC that his wife was permitted to go to Australia for three months in 2017 with the child, but from Australia she applied for overseas citizenship of India for herself and son.

On the other hand, a court in Dallas, Texas, granted him the child’s custody while dissolving the marriage in July 2018, the father claimed. He has also filed a habeas corpus petition in the Dallas court for the child’s custody and the petition is pending.

The wife has also filed for the child’s custody in a Valsad court under the Guardians and Wards Act. She has also sued the husband under the Domestic Violence Act. Both applications are pending.

After hearing the petition, the high court denied the father custody saying that the custody with the mother cannot be termed illegal. The father’s habeas corpus petition was not maintainable because he had filed a similar petition in a foreign court. The HC further said that the father has got civil remedy to get custody of the child. The HC also noted that the habeas corpus petition was filed belatedly.

Besides, as the couple are Muslim, the HC said that according to Mohammedan law, the mother has a right to the child’s custody, if the child is male and below seven years of age.

The high court also took into consideration the allegation that the husband assaulted his wife and child in the USA at the instigation of a woman he was in an extramarital relationship with. “Now, taking into consideration this situation, we are satisfied that the child’s return may expose him to grave risk of harm. Therefore, it will be appropriate to refuse to issue directions to return the child to native state and more particularly in spite of a pre-existing order of the foreign court,” the HC said.

104,['26/02/2020'],Minister grants Haroon’s SSLC exam request,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: When Haroon Kareem T K , a blind Class X student of GVHSS Mankada in Malappuram, was writing his SSLC model exams last week, he was informed by school authorities that his application to write exams with the help of a computer was rejected by the director of general education (DGE). The district education officer of Malappuram received a directive that using a computer for SSLC exam is disallowed due to the lack of general guidelines.

Now, just weeks before his SSLC exam, education minister C Raveendranath has paved the way for Haroon to become the first blind student in Kerala to write the state board exam using a computer. Blind students use a combination of advanced software including screen readers and infty editor to listen to questions and answer them using a normal keyboard. Screen readers can then be used to check the answers.

Sources in the minister’s office said when the issue came up, Raveendranath took a proactive stand and approved the request. The GO will be released after a couple of days when DGE Jeevan Babu, who is in Dubai, returns. The delay is unlikely to affect Haroon as the first paper is a practical exam on computer applications on Saturday. Theory exams will begin on March 10, before which Haroon is expected to receive the GO.

Haroon, who was in Thiruvananthapuram to meet the minister and officials, said he was waiting for the special sanction when his friends were revising their lessons. “I have been using a computer to take notes and study for the past several years. It is difficult to communicate science and maths to scribes, who are junior students. For example, terms like sin in maths. I lost marks when the scribe misspelled Hindi words. I was hoping to write the exams using a computer when I learnt that I must choose a scribe or braille during my model exam (maths). That was the only model exam I fared badly,” said Haroon who usually scores 98% in maths.

Guidelines for conducting written exam for persons with benchmark disabilities 2018 states that such persons ‘will be given the option of choosing the mode of exam i.e. in braille or using a computer or in large print or even by recording the answers as examining bodies can easily make use of technology to convert question paper into e-large print, texts or braille’. Though other board exams made necessary changes to use assistive technologies, Kerala hadn’t taken a sensitive approach.

Ram Kamal Manoj, managing trustee of NGO Chakshumati that is engaged in the welfare of blind students, said SCERT often tries to discourage students from take the science stream.

“When students can use assistive technology independently, they are discouraged from using technology. Revised exam guidelines for persons with disabilities is still being processed at the office of DGE. Blind students shift to CBSE at the last minute to write exams using assistive technology. Haroon did not give up and now he is set to become the first students to write SSLC using computers,” he said.

105,['26/02/2020'],UP government begins probe against 5 mining officials for graft,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Yogi Adityanath

LUCKNOW: The Yogi Adityanath government on Tuesday initiated an inquiry against five mining officials, including one geologist, three assistant geologists and one mine inspector.

The three assistant geologist who will face inquiry are Adal Prasad, Arvind Kumar and Vijay Maurya, who were posted in Shamli, Kaushambi and Deoria respectively.

Likewise, geologist Moinuddin who was posted in Hamirpur and mine inspector Pankaj Singh who was posted in Deoria, will also be subjected to inquiry. Government sources said CBI had also registered an FIR against the five officials. The inquiry against the officials would be conducted by senior mining engineer Sudhir Dubey.

The five officials face charges of ignoring state government rules, allowing illegal mining and causing revenue loss to the state exchequer. The officials also face the charge of irregularities in renewing the licence of ‘patta’ (land lease).

The crackdown on mining officials comes in the backdrop of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report, which has highlighted irregularities in the mining of minerals in the state in 2017-18, after BJP came to power in UP, as well during the previous SP regime between 2012 and 2017.

The report, which was tabled in UP assembly on Monday had found irregularities in 148 land leases, amounting to Rs 226.65 crore in 2017-18.

The CAG indicted mining department of causing revenue loss of nearly Rs 900 crore to the state exchequer during the Akhilesh Yadav regime.

106,['26/02/2020'],No role in bank-staff disputes: RBI tells Gujarat high court on bank strikes,"This story is from February 26, 2020

RBI also asserted that it can issue directions to banks

AHMEDABAD: The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) on Tuesday told the Gujarat high court that though it has powers to take action against striking bank employees, the issue of ‘strikes’ does not fall in the ambit of banking policy and it has “no role in enforcement and implementation of regulations” framed by banks.

The RBI was responding to a PIL filed by trade federations of Gujarat seeking HC directions against employees of public sector banks saying that such strikes are against the public interest.

The HC asked the RBI whether it has any powers to act against striking bank employees.

The RBI has said, “Every bank has its own regulations on conduct and discipline of its employees and the RBI has no role in enforcement and implementation of such regulations. Even otherwise, there are separate labour laws to deal with the issue of strikes by employees.”

The RBI further said that it has supervisory and regulatory powers and powers to determine banking policy. It can act against employees of banks, if it feels that their actions are against the interest of monetary stability or sound economic growth. The RBI said that it has power under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act “to issue directions to banking companies generally or any banking company in particular, where it is satisfied that in public interest or in the interest of the banking policy or to prevent the affairs of the banking company being conducted in a manner prejudicial to the banking company or to secure the proper management of any banking company generally…but at the same time, it is relevant to state that disputes between the banks and their employees/union would not fall within the ambit of banking policy as defined in the Act.”

The RBI also asserted that it can issue directions to banks, but the trade federation cannot seek HC directions to RBI to exercise its discretion.

The hearing was adjourned by the court after it was submitted that the bank managements and employee unions are likely to hold meetings to resolve issues that were the cause for the strikes.

The house in Gundi Chowk where the slurry has been gushing out from beneath

AHMEDABAD: Panic broke out in the Gundi Chowk area in Saraspur when a cave-in was reported from a house near RC High School. The residents rushed out and found chemicals mixed with mud flowing out of their house.

This is the second such incident reported on the underground Metro route from Apparel Park to Saraspur. On January 4, a similar case occurred near Karimni Chawl behind Sarangpur Bridge.

In the Gundi Chowk case, Nitin Dataniya — a resident of the affected house — called the fire brigade. Firefighters found that the cave-in inside the house had been caused by the digging of the Metro authorities. Metro officials were informed that chemicals were gushing out of the house and the officials reached the area.

A team of the Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation (GMRC) Limited officials began the cleaning operation. Amit Gupta, the chief general manager of the GMRC, said: “When the tunnel boring machine was operated, a chemical was pushed with force to soften the soil.” The chemical flows out if there is a borewell or some other outlet, Gupta said. “In this case, an undetected well caused the foam to gush out.”

Gupta said that the family will be shifted to a hotel and it will be compensated for the damages. According to Gupta, the authorities will resume work after all safety measures are taken.

A senior official said that usually the Metro carries out a survey of every house before work begins, but in many cases, residents are not aware of borewells or wells on the premises. Dataniya said that the house belongs to his relative and he lives there with his mother, sister, and sister-in-law.

110,['26/02/2020'],Auto dealers offer discounts to clear BS-IV stock before March 31,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Nagpur: Following the Supreme Court’s order to impose a ban on sale and registration of Bharat Stage IV vehicles from April 1, 2020, 37 two-wheeler and 53 non-transport and transport vehicles’ dealers in the city are offering additional discounts to sell stocked vehicles.

“Though most of the automobile dealers have restricted orders of vehicles from the companies itself, now with the apex court’s order, many of us are offering additional discounts to clear the stock of BS-IV vehicles,” said AK Gandhi one of the top automobile dealers in the city. “We are not offering much discounts on vehicles which are in good demand,” he added.

Director of a city based four-wheeler dealer Himanshu Arya said that most of the four-wheeler dealers in the city too are offering stock clearing discounts ranging between Rs70,000 to Rs2 lakh. Buyers of two-wheelers are getting discounts between Rs5,000 and Rs10,000.

To a query, another automobile dealer said that they faced financial loss when BS-III vehicles were replaced by BS-IV. “We got very less time then but this time we have been preparing since early 2019 and most of the dealers had restricted their orders to the manufacturing companies itself,” the dealer said.

Transport commissioner Shekhar Channe told TOI that his office has received the apex court’s order and is preparing a notification stating BS-IV vehicles will not be registered after March 31, 2020. “After April 1, BS IV vehicles will neither be sold nor registered,” he said.

The order will be issued after the Supreme Court imposed a ban on sale and registration of BS IV, as BS-VI technology has already been introduced for cleaner fuel and environment safety.

Channe said all the regional transport officers in the state will be informed to give written instructions to vehicle dealers for submitting all registration approval cases of BS-IV vehicles before March end. So that its registration could be completed in time and the buyer gets all legal documents within the prescribed time frame.

He added that it has been noted that many a time customers wait till last moment hoping for discounts, so if the dealer wishes to provide discount then they must declare it before the deadline.

The commissioner has asked all RTOs to inform dealers about it and avail information about the available stock of BS-IV vehicles by end of this month. “Earlier, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) had amended section 115 of allowed for registration and sale out of chassis of BS-IV vehicles till June 30 and September 30, this year,” confirmed a senior official from the regional transport office here.

But the Supreme Court recently rejected the transport ministry’s stand to given extension for registration of BS-IV vehicles.

DEHRADUN: Dissatisfied with recent instance of cheating in the forest guard recruitment exam and alleged failure of state government to provide jobs, around 500 unemployed youth conducted a protest rally from Parade Ground to secretariat in the heart of the city on Tuesday. The protesters were still on a sit-in outside secretariat amid heavy rain till the time of filing of this report late at night.

The agitators kept on raising slogans against the state government and demanded cancellation of the forest guard examination. “In July 2018, chief minster Trivendra Singh Rawat had said that there are 18,000 vacant job posts. Why are those not being filled?"" Bobby Panwar, chairperson, Uttarkahand Unemployed Persons’ Union, told TOI.

The protesters also claimed that officials are accepting computer certificate, mandatory for certain posts, issued from select centres only. “Computer certificates from several valid institutions are not being considered. The government should make it clear certificates of which institutes will be valid. There should be clarity on this when the vacancy is announced,” added Panwar.

Another demand of protesters was that the government must release an annual calendar of upcoming recruitment examinations. “Other states publish their annual examinations calendar. Why can’t Uttarakhand publish such calendars? The state government must ensure fair play in regard to employment,” said Panwar.

Another agitator Kamlesh Bhatt, a member of Uttarakhand Berojgaar Sangh , told TOI: “Our cause is genuine. Most of us are either unemployed or contractual workers. We all want a stable job. But the state government is unable to provide us any opportunity.""

The protesters handed over a list of their demands to state government officials and also sought resignation of the officers who failed in conducting the forest guard examination properly.

Meanwhile, S Raju, chairman of Uttarakhand Subordinate Service Selection Commission (UKSSSC), assured the agitating youths of providing fair job opportunities to all. “Ever since its formation in 2015, UKSSSC has conducted over 66 examinations and all were aimed at providing jobs to the youths. Among these examinations, irregularities were found in only six examinations and five of those were caught by the UKSSSC itself. Stringent action was taken in every case,” added Raju.

Santosh Badoni, secretary of UKSSSC, added that ""all those who will be found guilty of committing or helping cheating in the forest guard recruitment examination will be barred from appearing in any of the UKSSSC examination in future.""

The warehouse facility will be built as part of the Smart City project. The site owned by TRIDA at Erumakuzhy has been chosen for the facility. Smart City Thiruvananthapuram Ltd CEO P Balakiran said that the project will be implemented at a cost of Rs 8.1 crore. It will cater to the needs of Chalai Market which extends from East Fort to Killipalam.

“The proposed warehouse will have six huge chambers for storage. One chamber will be used exclusively for cold storage and remaining chambers will be used for general warehouse purpose. The market is badly in need of an advanced warehousing facility and this will be a key step in ensuring scientific and proper storage,” said Balakiran.

Proposed to be built in over 2,500sq.m, the warehouse will also address grave concerns regarding use of chemicals to extend the storage life of perishables.

“If you look at Chalai Market, it is a place where majority of the products being sold are perishable goods. In the absence of a proper warehouse facility, people often resort to use of chemicals or any other method to ensure that they do not suffer loss. Once this new facility comes up at Erumakuzhy, merchants can make use of a scientific storage mechanism and consumers can look forward to purchasing healthy and safe food items. This will have multiple benefits for a place like Chalai,” said Balakiran.

While launching the revamped vegetable market at Chalai, minister Kadakampally Surendran spoke of the upcoming projects for city’s busiest commercial hub and also sought more co-operation from merchants. “In Kozhikode, the revamp of ‘Mittayi Theruvu’ was estimated to take 18 months, but the project could be finished in seven months. Here it took a long time to complete the project to revamp the vegetable market. The merchants should introspect as to who is going to benefit from this project,” he said.

The minister said that there have been attempts to torpedo this scheme and some of the merchants fell into the trap of those trying to topple the scheme. The revamp of meat market and fish market should be completed within a quicker time frame. “Every project requires some compromises. We will face some difficulties during relocation but with co-operation, the project could be completed within three-four months,” the minister said.

Architect G Sankar, who designed the Heritage project, also recalled the issues that the team had to deal especially with regard to relocation of vendors. A total of 225 vendors are being shifted to the new vegetable stalls. Sankar said that some of the area could be used for rehabilitating meat vendors till new meat and fish stalls are constructed.

Police clamp down on protesters from VRAS near Manish Nagar

NAGPUR: An attempted agitation in support of statehood for Vidarbha, christened ‘Rail Roko Andolan’, was quelled by city police at Manish Nagar Railway Crossing on Tuesday.

Close to 700 activists from Vidarbha Rajya Andolan Samiti (VRAS) tried to rush to the railway crossing, shouting slogans of ‘Jai Vidarbha’ from a nearby garden — where they had gathered in the morning from various parts of Vidarbha. They were stopped by Nagpur police ahead of the railway crossing.

A few activists who entered the railway crossing were rounded up by the railway protection force (RPF) and government railway police (GRP), before they could stop a passing train.

Ram Neole, the chief organizer of VRAS, said that it is “high time that the Central government creates a separate state for Vidarbha”. Neole added that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had already lost Maharashtra, and proponents of Vidarbha statehood could completely wipe out the party from Vidarbha too, if the demand is not heeded.

The Rail Roko agitation was carried out since railway is a Central subject, and creating a separate state for Vidarbha is also in the Prime Minster Narendra Modi-led Central government’s court.

Former MLA and VRAS senior leader Wamanrao Chatap said that the demand for Vidarbha statehood was “a 103 years old”, and that the Centre needs to take a decision in this regard. The farmers’ issue in the state is very serious and the government should take immediate steps to resolve them, he added.

Chatap also demanded 200 units of free power for the people of Vidarbha, along the lines of the Delhi government.

The RPF, Nagpur police force and GRP were alert to the situation as they knew about the planned protest in advance. Around 300 activists were detained and sent to Sonegaon police station, including Ram Neole and Wamanrao Chatap.

Ahmedabad: A 64-year-old man from New Ranip on Monday filed a complaint with the Sabarmati police stating that a man aged around 25 had cheated him by withdrawing Rs 45,000 with his ATM card.

The complainant said that the accused had swapped his card at an ATM centre in the New Ranip area on Sunday evening.

In his FIR filed with the Sabarmati police, Nikul Adhwaryu, a resident of Gold Apartments in New Ranip, said that he works as a supervisor with a private company and had gone to the ATM on Sunday evening to withdraw cash.

Adhwaryu said that the ATM had run out of cash. When he was about to leave, the accused entered and offered to help him. The man took Adhwaryu’s ATM card and tried to make transactions. After a while, he told Adhwaryu that the ATM had run out of cash and gave back a card.

Adhwaryu drove back home on his scooter and mid-way he received a message that Rs 45,000 had been deducted from his account. When he checked his bank statement, he found that the money had been withdrawn in three transactions from the same ATM. On checking his card, Adhwaryu found that it was not his.

The election for the four seats in Gujarat will be held on March 26.The term of office of four members of the Rajya Sabha elected from Gujarat — Chunibhai Gohel, Madhusudan Mistry, Lalsinh Vadodiya and Shambhuprasad Tundiya — ends on April 9. While Mistry represents the Congress, the other three represent the BJP.With the budget session of the state assembly starting on Wednesday, and RS elections scheduled for March 26, both BJP and Congress are in election mode. A candidate will need 37 first preference votes to get elected as a Rajya Sabha MP.Meanwhile, both BJP and Congress are facing pressure in finalizing candidates for the election. While sitting MPs are seeking re-nomination, a number of hopefuls are also demanding the nomination.If there is no cross voting or abstentions, the BJP will lose one seat to the Congress, as it does not have adequate numbers to get three candidates re-elected. On the other hand, assuming independent MLA Jignesh Mevani votes for Congress candidates, the Congress has enough MLAs to get two candidates elected.In the run-up to the 2017 Gujarat assembly election, more than a dozen Congress MLAs switched sides, while five more MLAs resigned after the 2017 election.

Thiruvananthapuram: The city saw one of the biggest protests in recent history when anti-CAA protesters laid siege to Raj Bhavan under the aegis of Welfare Party of India.

The 30-hour protest titled ‘Occupy Raj Bhavan’ was inaugurated by Asma Khatun (90) of Shaheen Bagh, one of the oldest women leading the protest there. She handed over a copy of the preamble of the Constitution to Aysha Renna of Jamia Millia Islamia University, who is one of the young faces of the protest.

Khatun said it was the brutality on their children at Jamia Millia Islamia that prompted mothers of Shaheen Bagh to launch the protest.

Congress leaders Adoor Prakash and MM Hassan, IUML general secretary KPA Majeed spoke at the event. Welfare Party of India state president Hameed Vaniyambalam delivered the keynote address.

On Wednesday, Bilkis (82) and Sarvari (75) of Shaheen Bagh will turn up at the protest venue to address the agitators.

Agitators have taken position in front of the main gate of Raj Bhavan, blocking the Vellayambalam–Kowdiar road.

Though the police started regulating vehicle movement by diverting traffic at Vellayambalam and Kowdiar junctions, it led to chaos on the road during peak hours. Many residents even vented their anguish on social media as the main road was blocked on a working day.

Traffic regulation will continue on Wednesday till the protest ends and traffic won’t be allowed from Vellayambalam-Kowdiar road. Police advised motorists coming from Nedumangad side to use alternative routes via Pippinmoodu-Sasthamangalam and Kuravankonam-Nanthancode.

Meanwhile, Sainuddeen (69) from Pathanapuram, who turned up to take part in the agitation, died after he collapsed under the scorching sun at 2pm. Though he was rushed to hospital, doctors declared him dead on arrival. His body was moved to medical college hospital’s mortuary. It will be handed over to the family after conducting autopsy.

KOLKATA: In a show of solidarity, Bangabasi College student and Habra resident Souvik had on Saturday put up Amulya Leona’s photo as his Facebook profile picture. The 19-year old girl was charged with sedition for raising ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ slogan at an anti-CAA protest in Bengaluru. Over the last 72 hours, Souvik has been labelled a traitor, jihadi and a Pakistan sympathiser by right-wing supporters.Souvik said he was trolled and warned by ABVP supporters SD Shan Das and Atanu Barai. “The trolling started from Monday and I was called a jihadi, a traitor, a Pakistan sympathizer by the right-wing supporters and groups. They threatened to visit my home and bash me up. They have even reported my Facebook profile to Kolkata Police’s Facebook page,” said the political science student.Souvik felt as a student and a sensible citizen, it was his responsibility to show support to the 19-year old girl who was not given a chance to complete her speech and explain her stand. “She has been booked with sedition for saying ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ but she also said ‘Hindustan Zindabad’. If someone sees her Facebook post, it will be clear what she meant to say. She wanted to hail every country and its people. At a time, when people all over the world, mostly minorities, are being deprived of their rights, it is our duty to work for the people,” said SouvikIn spite of facing wrath from several quarters, Souvik said he completely supported Amulya’s statement: “I don’t become a part of a different nation just because I say zindabad to that nation. As per law, I am an Indian citizen and it is my duty to respect my nation.” He wondered why saying ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ can be seditious but not ‘Long Live America’. “It is unfortunate that my post ‘Long Live America’ was not trolled but my act of putting Amulya’s picture didn’t go down well with a section. This makes the narrative of the right-wing groups clear. I will visit Lalbazar on Wednesday to make my stand clear and register a complaint, “ said Souvik.SFI leader Suvajit Sarkar felt: “Democracy is threatened when someone is trolled just for putting up a picture. Everyone has the right to express their views and should not be put on a trial using social media.

gangster Ravi Pujari

who was nabbed in South Africa

MANGALURU: The first lead on Udupi-born gangster Ravi Pujari was provided to Karnataka police by a man who lived with him in Burkina Faso but finked on him in return for money. The man provided details and pictures of the hotel run by Pujari in the African country and its outlets, a source privy to the gangster’s hunt revealed.This was the first piece of credible information that ADGP (law and order) Amar Kumar Pandey and ACP Venkatesh Prasanna , the two-man team hunting for Pujari since June 2018, got.Handpicked for the job, Pandey had summoned Prasanna asking him to join him in the probe. Only three years earlier, Prasanna had been part of the team that got back another fugitive don, Bannanje Raja, extradited to India from Morocco.The two officers had no lead on Pujari though he’d been booked in several cases of murder, attempt to murder and extortion. No agency in the country had a clue about his whereabouts, the source said.The first thing the officers got to know about the gangster was his refrain in every extortion call he made: “I am Ravi Pujari speaking from Australia,” the extortionist would say. The two officers knew Pujari was bluffing as no criminal would give such accurate details.Sifting through his dossiers, they came to know Pujari was first arrested for robbery in Mumbai in 1992. “They finally managed to get an informant, who agreed to help after a lot of persuasion. He connected police with a person living with Pujari, who allegedly agreed to give information in exchange for money. He told police the man they were looking for was in Burkina Faso and ran a hotel. He gave details about the hotel’s outlets. The informant even shared photos of the hotels from different angles. Police, by then, managed to find another ‘khabri’ (informant) who said there was no Ravi Pujari in Burkina Faso but a man by the name Fernandes,” the source said.The officers spent at least one month checking passports looking for Fernandes. They called the first informant every day. They got a tip off that his house was located near Cambodian English School and through another informant, got the location and a route map. At this point, they received information that he’d left the country by road.It took another 2-3 months for police to get back on track. One of the informants provided them a picture where Ravi Pujari was seen distributing a prize to a winner at a cricket match. Experts found out from the photograph that one of the men in it wore a T-shirt with the word, Cricketers Club, Senegal. Pandey and Prasanna were now sure that Pujari was holed up in Senegal and got in touch with central agencies about their findings.Soon, he was arrested in Senegal. But he claimed he was not Ravi Pujari and showed his Burkina Faso passport to identify himself as Anthony Fernandes from Mysuru. But Prasanna had a copy of his fingerprints collected by Mumbai police when he was arrested in 1992 .",mangaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74310670,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-666446,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/man-who-lived-with-pujari-was-first-to-snitch-on-him/articleshow/74308163.cms

Picture used for representational purpose only

AHMEDABAD: To monitor human-wildlife conflict, the Gujarat forest department has started building high towers called ‘machadas’ in Gir and Greater Gir landscape, the last habitat of Asiatic lions.

The towers are equipped with solar-powered mobile charger, and financial assistance of Rs 17,300 is given to farmers for the foundation work for the machadas, officials said.

“The scheme has been rolled out recently and 8,000 farmers have so far enlisted. With big cats increasingly moving out of protected areas, we aim to implement this scheme aggressively and cover new areas like Chotila,” said a forest official.

The scheme aims to protect people from being attacked by lions and the farmers can seek refuge on these machadas, where they can rest or even sleep to escape attacks from wild animals.

“Issues for conservation are changing, the lion is regaining its territory and moving out of the core area, hence it is important for the forest department to gear up for the new challenges, not just for lion but all species,” said D K Sharma, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) and head of forest force (HoFF), Gujarat.

He was speaking at a session on the conservation efforts by Gujarat forest department at the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS-COP13) held in Gandhinagar recently.

There are 523 lions in a 22,000 sq km area across eight districts of Gujarat, including the Gir sanctuary, according to the census carried out in 2015. Asiatic lions in Gujarat have seen a considerable rise in their numbers due to key management practices such as habitat management, wildlife monitoring, mitigating human-wildlife conflict, rescue operations, wildlife crime control, eco-tourism, people’s participation, awareness programs and research and training, he said.

Mohan Ram, deputy conservator of forests, Sasan, ascribed significance to research and training as they are the basis of all other practices. The Gir National Park area has camera traps for monitoring, radio-collaring of lions (world’s largest project), GPS monitoring, a wireless communication system, foot patrols and state of the art facilities with the wildlife rescue service.

KOLKATA: A group of visually impaired youths on Tuesday chose the platform of a fashion show and cultural event to voice their concerns over the countrywide protests against the CAA/NRC. They said that their physical inabilities prevented them from going to rallies but they felt the need to speak up against the “coercive” manner in which the citizenship issue was being handled by the Centre.

Most of the participants held posters decrying CAA/NRC, calling it an unnecessary evil. They stood on the stage of the Rabindra Okakura Bhawan, Salt Lake, that had been prepared for a fashion walk. “Unless all of us unite to take a stand against the issue, the message will never reach the Centre,” said Ilyas Molla, a visually impaired RBU student.

Bachchu Bera, who will be representing India as part of the visually impaired football team against Bangladesh on March 9, took part in Tuesday’s event. “Today, even students are not being spared. Though we are visually impaired, we are aware of the bloodshed,” added classical singer Arjun Sarkar.

The programme was jointly organised by Rotary Club of Kolkata South East, Lions Club of Kolkata Sunshine, Sapne and Indian Human Rights & Crime Control Organisation. “We hope other NGOs wil start giving them such protest spaces,” said Ashish Basak, spokesperson for the initiative.

Thiruvananthapuram: Attukal Bhagavathy Temple will witness congregation of lakhs of women to offer pongala on March 9. Attukal Pongala is held on the ninth day of festival which will begin on March 1.

The pongala, which has entered the Guinness World of Records as largest gathering of women in 1997 and 2009, will begin at 10.20am with the lighting of pongala hearths and ends by around 2.10pm with the sanctification. The festival will conclude with the ceremonial removal of ‘Kappu’ (kappu azhippu) and the ‘kuruthi tharppanam’ on March 10.

Thiruvananthapuram: A reading space for book worms among the techies will soon become a reality at Technopark . Prathidhwani, a socio-cultural organization of techies, has proposed to start a branch of State Central Library at the IT hub.

Prathidhwani has launched a survey to understand the needs of the readers. The plan is to start a library along the lines of the one functioning at Infopark in Kochi.

Dipin Varghese, who was among the people behind the initiative at Infopark and now works at Technopark, said that a meeting was held with Technopark officials and State Central Library authorities and they received positive response from them.

“A library in Technopark has been a long-time demand. We had sent a request in this regard to the higher education department and the State Central Library. The library at Kochi was started in association with Ernakulam Public Library a few years ago. The library is open on one day each week. People can select their books of choice online and library staff brings the books to Infopark. Here, we have planned a library with all infrastructure facilities,” said Dipin.

As a first step towards the initiative the survey was launched. A space near Technopark Club is proposed for the library. A library operating committee has been formed and techies Sabari and Kavitha were selected as its representatives.

“We received around 200 responses within two days of the survey. The survey will be completed in two weeks. Also, considering the demand we will have a separate section for children’s books,” said Dipin.

As of now they have also planned to start a small library by collecting books from the IT community, till the State Central Library branch starts functioning here. It will be open for one or two days in a week and will be managed by techies.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signalled immediate launch of negotiations for a free trade agreement with India with his administration expected to kick off the process through the mandated 90-day notice to the US Congress over the next few days.The move will come along with legal vetting of what is expected to be a $10 billion “limited trade deal” expected to see a restoration of generalised system of preferences (GSP) scheme for India in return for dismantling of “retaliatory tariffs” on American almonds, walnuts and pulses, apart from lowering import duties on high-end motorbikes like Harley Davidson and several farm and food products like cherries.The US too is expected to ease access of Indian food products such as pomegranates. Some of the products on the list may spill over into the free trade agreement, whose details will be thrashed out once negotiations start. Though different from trade issues under discussion, the FTA should signal closer cooperation on trade and commerce in keeping with the overall forward momentum in bilateral ties.“We will hopefully close the first end of the limited engagement that we have already discussed and nearly finalised, ambassador Robert Lighthizer (the US Trade Representative) and I. We’ll get into legal vetting and close that quickly,” commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said at an event.An announcement on finalising the ‘limited’ trade deal, which many believed was off the table for the moment due to divergent positions, came after bilateral talks at Hyderabad House in the capital. “As far as bilateral trade is concerned, our commerce ministers have had a positive dialogue. President Trump agreed the understanding between our commerce ministers should be given legal shape. We have agreed to launch negotiations for a large trade deal,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in remarks to the media along with Trump.India has also flagged the need for a ‘Totalisation Agreement’ which will allow Indian software professionals to get a refund of the social security contribution that they make while in the US.Once the US completes its internal domestic formalities, the Trade Policy Forum will set up a joint study group to work out the contours of the proposed FTA before actual negotiations kick off. India has focused its trade agreements on reducing import duties of goods in return for getting more visas for its software professionals, chartered accountants and nurses, apart from investment.The US, however, typically seeks a broader agreement, which also seeks to tackle what have been contentious issues such as intellectual property rights dealing with patents as well as regulation of state-owned enterprises. Besides, the US may also seek that its concerns on data flow and opening up FDI for retail and insurance are also addressed.The Indian government appears hopeful of clinching a deal quickly, while assuring interests of Indian industry are protected with Goyal promising comprehensive stakeholder consultations. “We can do a much larger trade deal much faster for two-three reasons... We are both transparent economies. We can trust each other, we can talk with openness and fairness and in the spirit the two nations have decided to engage on a fast-track basis. So, I certainly do not see that this will be like one of those free trade agreement negotiations going for decades and years,” he said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74309868,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-273359,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/big-trade-deal-elusive-india-us-eye-free-trade-agreement/articleshow/74309846.cms

Thiruvananthapuram: In case you are a chess buff, it won’t be long before you can enjoy a round of chess in the park with your friends or family.

For the first time in the city, open chess areas, selfie points and roller skating yards will come up in two parks. Roller skating yard and open chess areas will be the major attractions at Children’s Park at LMS-Vellayambalam Road, opposite the Kanakakkunnu Palace which will be developed under the Smart City project. Selfie point is one of the key components included under the redevelopment of the Sree Chithira Park.

The project will focus on revamping the parks into more active zones with craft stalls, open air theatre, selfie points, sculptural & landscape elements. SCTL issued tenders for both projects on Tuesday. Sree Chithira Park will be revamped at a cost of Rs 1.78 crore and the Children’s Park at Palayam will be revamped at a cost of Rs 1.72 crore.

Children’s Park, Palayam, will be revamped within nine months. Open chess and food kiosk have been envisaged. Entry ramps will be constructed which will lead to the activity hub. The entrance gate will be re-done and a plaza point will be made which will double up as an interactive space for pedestrians along footpath. A barrier-free pathway will also be constructed linking all the facilities of the park, starting from the entry point.

The open chess area shall have facilities both for children and adults. A roller skating yard will be constructed for children below 10 years of age. Two food kiosks will function near the open chess area. There will be three different seating provisions in the park. The park will also have an open gym.

SAAR president Mukesh Singh and ASI deputy superintending archaeologist (pre-history) Dr Manoj Kumar Kurmi in ... Read More

Chandigarh: In a first, a team from the Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) is carrying out an “exploration” of fossils around Masol to build on an Indo-French research team’s theory that the first intelligent ancestors of Homo sapiens roamed the hilly village in Mohali district nearly 2.8 million years ago.

An official of ASI confirmed that a four-member team from the central body’s pre-history branch was working at the site. “Our team is working in collaboration with researchers from ASI’s Chandigarh circle, in continuation of the study earlier conducted by the French team,” said Dr Manoj Kumar Kurmi, deputy superintending archaeologist of ASI’s pre-history branch and who is overseeing the entire exercise.

If ASI is able to find more evidence to back the Indo-French team’s study, which concluded that findings in Masol could change the way human evolution is looked at, it would deepen research into the prehistoric site. Dr Kurmi’s team has been issued an exploration and excavation licence from the ASI for carrying out the work till September 2020.

The team, according to a source, arrived for exploring the prehistoric site earlier this month. The source said area around Masol was large and they would be looking for a “suitable” site to carry out a detailed investigation. “If a suitable site is found, we will go for an excavation to establish a stratigraphic sequence,” said Dr Kurmi.

A stratigraphic sequence is a chronologic succession of sedimentary rocks from older below to younger above. Dr Kurmi said stratigraphic sequence, if they are right, would help strengthen claims made by the Indo-French team. “There are positive signs. We have found some tools. We are looking for a possible place where excavation could be carried out,” said another source in the ASI.

When contacted, Mukesh Singh, a member of the Indo-French team and president of Society for Archaeological and Anthropological Research, welcomed the development. Be it the Centre or the Punjab government, the protection of fossils in Masol has been poor. No steps have been taken so far to stop people from taking away fossils and stone tools found there.

Representative image

BHUBANESWAR: The Khurda district and sessions judge, Loknath Mohapatra, on Tuesday awarded life imprisonment to retired Army doctor Somnath Parida (78) after convicting him of killing his wife Ushashree and chopping her body into pieces in his bungalow in upscale Nayapalli here in June 2013.

Nayapalli Police had arrested Parida on June 22, 2013, after finding the body parts of Ushashree (62 at the time of death) stashed in 22 boxes in the couple’s house on June 21. They said he had killed her on June 3 and kept the body parts in the house, where the couple lived on their own, as he was confident they would not be discovered.

His crime would have gone unnoticed had Ushashree’s brother not visited the house on the evening of June 21. His suspicions were aroused by Parida’s furtive actions and the foul smell emanating from the house, and he informed police.

Police had conducted a polygraph test on Parida on June 29, 2013, and filed a charge-sheet in court on October 17, 2013. Since his arrest, Parida has been kept in the Jharpada Special Jail here.

Public prosecutor Sarad Chandra Samant said the sensational murder had been the result of prolonged bitterness between the couple. Parida was not on talking terms with his daughter, who then lived in the UAE. Ushashree, who would talk to their daughter on the phone regularly, had angered Parida by insisting on letting her visit the Bhubaneswar house. Matters between the couple soured further and he is believed to have killed her in a fit of rage.

“Ushashree died after being hit on the head with a blunt object,” the public prosecutor said. “I had sought capital punishment for Parida as the nature of the offence is barbaric,” he added.

Police sources said the couple’s daughter and son had both given statements against their father. They had also said Parida had planned to dispose of Ushashree’s mutilated corpse in Shirdi.

On Tuesday, Parida broke down in court after the pronouncement of the verdict. “I am innocent. I was an honest officer in the Army. I never took bribes,” he told reporters outside the court.

Parida had joined the Army as Second Lieutenant in 1970 and retired as Lieutenant Colonel in1992.

KOLKATA: A day after Kasturi Basu, who was campaigning in her Patuli neighbourhood against the amended citizenship law, claimed that she had received death threats and the pro-CAA camp retorted that she had allegedly misbehaved and even slapped one of them, the cops said they were investigating the conflicting versions.

A few of those cops have spoken to so far are “trying to mislead the probe”. “We are trying to develop on a few CCTV footage leads in this respect,” said an officer from the south suburban division.

Police said the neighbours of the woman, Basu, who is an independent documentary filmmaker, will be approached soon. “As for our prima facie investigation, the pro-CAA camp was unhappy that their posters were being taken down. They were trying to identify the person who did it when Basu came out and stated those posters were hurting sentiments of some people. She dared them and an argument ensued. The pro-CAA camp said it was then that she had slapped one of them,” said an investigating officer.

The men who confronted Basu were led by Tulshi Gharami, the district president of the BJP-affiliated Bharatiya Janata Mazdoor Trade Union . Basu has denied slapping Gharami. Gharami and Basu both lodged complaints with Patuli police station after the face-off. “We have slapped IPC charges on both sides based on specific complaints. We have warned them against any further escalation,” said an officer.

Hyderabad: Passengers travelling from major railway stations in the city – Secunderabad, Mancherial, Kacheguda, Hyderabad and Nampally – are complaining about not being able to hear train announcements due to loud audio advertisements being played at the stations.

“The advertisements continuously run at the stations. They are very loud. As I am a regular passenger, I know my train timings. But those travelling occasionally may find it hard to navigate amid the loud chaos,” Keerthi Kalyanam, who was at Secunderabad railway station , told TOI.

Passengers say that they are missing their trains as the unregulated advertisements are drowning out important announcements.

“Due to unregulated non-stop ads at Mancherial railway station by Kartikeya advertisements, we can't even hear the train announcements. People playing with government property as they want because no one is checking,"" tweeted a passenger on Monday tagging the rail ministry, South Central Railway (SCR) and the respective divisional railway managers on Twitter.

Staffers at the railway stations say that there has been no marked change in the advertisements or announcements, however passengers say the frequency of public service announcements have lowered in the past few months and advertisements have increased.

""Necessary railway announcements are being made regularly at all stations, and very few advertisements run throughout the day but we will definitely look into the matter raised by the passengers,"" said an official from SCR.

Railway union members have come in support of the passengers saying that the commercialisation of the railway station space is a major reason behind may issues.

""Most of the railway stations in the city, especially Secunderabad, Kacheguda and Nampally have become increasingly commercialised. Number of private stores in and around the station have increased and the authorities are thereby running their ads continuously to earn more revenue,"" said a member of South Central Railway Mazdur Union (SCRMU).

Hyderabad: The dirt road at New Colony, Miyapur X Road, is getting a cement concrete layer, and the area is also getting an underground drainage line after residents living in that area highlighted their plight on TOI Citizen Reporter app.

Residents said they had reported the grievance several times to authorities, but in vain. Half of the road has already been laid by Tuesday. The grievance was published on February 11 in TOI Citizen Reporter section.

The first representation to fix the road was given in 2012, after which the budget was sanctioned, but the works did not take off.

“I took up the problem with MLA, corporators and GHMC officials too, but the issue was not fixed for years,” said Anwar Akhtar, the citizen reporter. “I reported the complaint so many times that I even remember the names of GHMC engineers. I thank TOI for publishing the issue.”

P Chinna Reddy, GHMC executive engineer of the area, said: “We are also laying underground drainage line in that area.”

Another resident said that the bad stretch had turned into a parking lot for autos. Residents also lodged a police complain about the illegal parking previous year.

“The autos, with seating capacity of seven, used to be parked on this kachha road. Now, after the GHMC started laying the new road, auto drivers are not parking their vehicles. Our security concerns have also come to an end along with commuting woes,” said Srinivas Murty a resident of New Colony. “People living in Laxminivasam and Srinivasam along and Narayandri Building will be benefited the most,” he added.

The road, which is being restored, is close to NH-65. Even a brief spell of rain brings stagnant water, and mosquitoes. This besides the piled up garbage.

A pothole-filled road in Kochi city (File Photo)

KOCHI: Now, if residents come across potholes or bad stretches of road in the city they can bring them to the attention of the amici curiae appointed by the high court.

The public can click pictures of potholes and post them on the WhatsApp numbers of advocates S Krishna, Vinod Bhatt, and P Deepak who were appointed amici curiae in the case seeking repair and maintenance of bad roads in the city.

The three have been entrusted with the task of going around and identifying places within Kochi corporation limits with potholes. They have been doing the activity since the last three months. Speaking to TOI, advocate P Deepak said, “Initially, the WhatsApp numbers were circulated among advocates. Later, we discussed the matter with the Kerala high court advocates association. They took it up and posted them on their website. As a result, responses have started to trickle in. The whole process has just started.”

The amici curiae want to diversify the activity by taking this activity to the municipalities adjoining Kochi corporation, particularly Maradu, Tripunithura and Kalamasserry. As it is difficult for the three to go around in all these areas, they publicized the WhatsApp numbers. As of now, these municipalities are not a party to the case. They requested the HC to implead the local bodies in the adjoining areas. The intention is to spread the message to a larger region.

Meanwhile, the Edappally-Tripunithura Road, SRM Road, entry point to Ponnurunni ROB from Vyttila Junction, the exit and entry roads to Subhas Chandra Bose Road from Vyttila Junction, Santo Gopalan Road and Pandikudy Road are in bad shape with maintenance work being carried out by Kerala water authority (KWA) and Kerala state electricity board (KSEB).

“Residents are forced to rely on these roads, even in case of emergencies, and this is frustrating. The dust that is generated on bad stretches blows into houses and shops, casuing health issues and other inconveniences,” said Sreedharan Nair, whose resides along the Edappally-Tripunithrua Road. He said people are clueless on when the road owners would complete the work.

Moreover, people will stand to benefit only if the WhatsApp system really works.

Vijayawada: Even as the state government tries to introduce reforms in the education department to check the collection of exorbitant amounts of fees in private schools, many corporate institutions in the city expedited the 2020-21 admission process without permission in a bid to rake in large amounts in fees.

Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who promised to create a stress-free pocket-friendly education system in the state, constituted Andhra Pradesh School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APSERMC) to implement education reforms.

The state government conducted inspections in private and corporate schools collecting unreasonably high fees and barred them from conducting admissions till they were given grades fixing the fee pattern.

But the majority of corporate schools in the city are conducting admissions ignoring the directions. Parents were busy gathering reference letters of ministers and other VIPs to get admissions for their kids in corporate schools. “Marketing teams of corporate school managements were repeatedly contacting us for the admission of my son in high school. They are offering huge discounts if we take admission before the completion of the academic year,” said J Lakshmi Narasimha a private employee.

Student associations strongly condemned the early admissions.

“Many corporate schools in the city completed 50 per cent of admissions in their schools. They were trying to attract parents by offering huge discounts. The education department should take necessary measures to stop the admission process before regulating the fee structure,” said K Ramesh state secretary of the Student Federation of India. Krishna district education officer Rajya Lakshmi speaking with TOI requested parents not to take up early admissions in corporate schools.

“We have noticed that many private schools in Krishna district are running against rules. They are collecting exorbitant amounts in fees. We have started inspections as per the guidance of APSERMC and schools violating norms will lose their recognition soon. Parents will suffer if they got admission to such schools,” she pointed out. I have directed deputy education officers across the district to identify schools taking early admissions and initiate stringent action against them, Rajyalakshmi added.

142,['26/02/2020'],Eyes on SC relief to resume work at NGT bench,"This story is from February 26, 2020

NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel had issued an office order transferring expert member Siddhanta Das ... Read More

PUNE: The NGT Western Zone Bar Association will seek a judicial order from the Supreme Court at the hearing of their writ petition on March 3 after the green tribunal’s administration in Delhi on Tuesday extended, for the second time, the date of resumption of functioning of the NGT western zone bench in Pune to April 1 for want of a judicial member.

“The Centre has finalized names of six judicial members for appointment, but the cabinet committee of ministers has not yet approved them, despite assurances to the SC at the previous hearings,” lawyer Saurabh Kulkarni , the association’s president told TOI. “We will raise this issue at the impending hearing to seek a judicial order from the Supreme Court (SC),” he added.

Since an SC order on January 1, 2018, an elaborate recruitment process is on for the appointment of judicial and expert members at the NGT benches. “The NGT’s Chennai bench, which has lesser matters compared to Pune, has already benefited from the recruitment process as it has resumed operation with a two-member bench from December 2, 2019,” Kulkarni said.

On January 2, NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel had issued an office order transferring expert member Siddhanta Das from the green tribunal’s principal bench in New Delhi to the Pune bench. Following this, the NGT administration had issued a circular stating that the western zone bench will become functional from February 1, 2020, subject to joining of a judicial member.

The development gave hope to several environmental litigants from Maharashtra , Gujarat, Goa and the Union Territories (UTs) of Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli considering that after New Delhi, the green tribunal’s Pune bench draws maximum number of litigations concerning several key environmental issues in these states and UTs. “The pendency of cases at the Pune bench is around 600,” Kulkarni said.

The litigants have been waiting for over two years now after an SC order on January 1, 2018, (in the WZ bar association’s petition which remains pending) restrained NGT cases from being heard by one-member benches. Between February and August 2018, only filing of cases was allowed at the Pune bench. In case of urgent matters, the litigants were required to move the principal bench in New Delhi for relief. After August 2018, the matters filed at Pune bench are being heard via video conferencing on an average two days per week for two-hour session each.

However, in another circular on January 31, the NGT administration extended the date of resumption of work at NGT’s Pune bench to March 2, subject to joining of a judicial member. The latest circular on Tuesday, once again cited a similar reason and stated that the Pune bench will start from April 1.

143,['26/02/2020'],Narrow Yapral road leads to brawls,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Hyderabad: A narrow carriageway coupled with commuters travelling in the wrong direction have led to several heated arguments at Yapral junction . The most recent skirmish, involving a retired defence personnel, has left locals fuming.

Describing the incident, Col Krishna Mohan Poduri (retd), said, “A scooter rider coming from Hanuman temple had taken a wrong turn and almost hit a motorcycle-borne family coming from the Ammuguda side. Despite being in the wrong, the scooter driver got aggressive, and when I intervened, he began attacking me and even tried to choke me.” A FIR has been lodged in the case at the Jawaharnagar police station.

The assault is among many skirmishes being reported from the area as a result of a lack of planning at the junction, say locals. Though the junction appears small, the volume of traffic it caters to has been on the rise.

Speaking about the roundabout, Malcom Wolfe, a road safety expert who lives in the area, said, “Space restriction does not allow larger vehicles to travel around the roundabout, which means they are forced to break rules.” Besides a narrow carriageway, he says street vendors and shanties have eaten into the road, reducing its area.

Wolfe said persistent follow-ups with the GHMC about improvement works over three years have met a dead-end.

Responding to the issue, GHMC assistant city planner, Malkajgiri, Md Khaliluddin, said that the zonal commissioner along with the executive engineer and other officials had inspected the site.

“Notices were issued for a building that is suspected to be protruding on to the road. The electricity department has given an estimate to shift electric poles which are on the road. A junction improvement plan is under consideration.”

Besides the road itself, locals say the area faces several challenges. K M Rajesh, a resident, said, “We find a lot of youngsters hanging about the area and drinking. This has become a concern especially for women who travel through the area.”

Attributing the issues to the increasing population in the area, Air Vice Marshal Sagar Bharti (retd), said, “The influx of residents and commuters following the city’s expansion requires one to revisit planning. More awareness must also be created so that people follow the rules.”

144,['26/02/2020'],US firm’s bankruptcy to hit handicrafts exporters,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Jaipur: The Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of the Texas-based Pier 1 Imports has rattled the handicraft exporters in Rajasthan leaving them wondering if they could recover collective dues of Rs 400 crore. Additionally, they are also confronted with the challenge of finding another buyer like Pier 1, on which some exporters depended fully.

The handicrafts industry estimates that over 70 companies from Jodhpur and Jaipur supplied home furnishings, decor, particularly furniture, table-top items and decorative accessories to the New York Stock Exchange listed Pier 1 and the dues pending with the company could be around Rs 400 crore.

But some exporters from the state said Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows the company to restructure or sell out and it is not that the pending dues will not be honoured.

“As part of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Pier 1 has already raised $260 million to revive its business. It is now closing down 450 loss making stores and has announced that the rest of the 1000-odd stores will conduct routine business. For the time being, the payments are stuck but the exporters will get back the money once the retailer comes out of the proceedings,” said an exporter in Jaipur who has been working with the retailer for close to a decade.

When TOI contacted the company to know its payment obligations to Indian exporters, the Pier 1 replied with a note that detailed about the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process which is yet to ascertain the liabilities of the company.

Exporters also take insurance for their exports so that they don’t lose out the entire receivables in the event of any mishap or the company failing to pay up. When TOI contacted the Jaipur branch of Export Credit Guarantee Corporation, which provides insurance against the shipments, an official said that they are yet to receive any claims.

“The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy only last week. It will take time to ascertain the liabilities. But once the exporters submit us the bills for which payments have not been received, we will start the process,” said the official.

Not every exporter is taking ECGC cover because it needs them to pay a premium. But the ECG official said that exporters can get back 80-90% of money if they submit the details of their policy.

Shirdi airport

PUNE: Chief minister Uddhav Thackrey on Tuesday told the Maharashtra Airport Development Company Limited to go ahead with the proposed new Pune airport project while presiding over its board meeting for the first time after the new government was formed.

“We briefed him about the developments and the status of the new Pune airport project. He did not react and just instructed us to continue with the work which was started,” a source in the Maharashtra Airport Development Company Limited (MADC) said.

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had earlier said he would take a decision on the project soon. Speculations are rife about the site of the project being shifted.

Sources in the MADC said Thackeray told the officials to focus on the Shirdi airport in the meeting and develop it aesthetically.

“We briefed Thackeray about the developments at Shirdi and he said that the new terminal building of the airport should have aspects of the Sai Baba temple and the temple town. He said the best practices should be followed for the construction,” another source said.

“The tender for the construction of the new terminal building would be floated next month. New flights to Delhi, Chennai and Indore have started from the Shirdi airport and IndiGo is operating an Airbus A-321, which can carry 222 passengers. There are 34 flight movements at Shirdi now. The status of Amravati airport was also discussed. We informed the chief minister that the airport would be re-developed and commissioned early next year for flights under UDAN,” the MADC official said.

Restaurants along Balewadi High Street

PUNE: Nearly 70 restaurateurs attended a meeting with the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA) and the police commissioner on Tuesday to air their grievances over the police’s action on facilities against alleged flouting of noise norms in the last fortnight.

The owners said police personnel had entered multiple restaurants in Koregaon Park and the surrounding areas around 9.30pm on February 15 over flouting of noise regulations. “Resultantly, almost all the restaurants in Koregaon Park, Kalyaninagar and the surrounding areas had to be closed early on February 15,” a restaurateur said.

Another restaurant owner said, “We are being told there have been noise complaints. The police are confiscating the equipment without investigation. The noise levels were not even checked before the systems were confiscated. We have all the permits and are following the law.”

PRAHA president Ganesh Shetty said, “We received complaints from our members across the city. There were instances where the customers were told to leave while the staff members were taken to the police station. Why is the police doing this even when restaurants have all the permissions? The police say they have got orders from the top.”

He said all restaurants in Maharashtra were allowed to serve liquor till 1.30am. “According to the Supreme Court guidelines, establishments can play music outdoors till 10pm. Music can be played indoors till the late hours if it does not cause a nuisance,” a restaurant owner said.

Shetty said the police action was only leading to revenue loss for restaurants. “Customers will not visit restaurants if police are stationed outside from 9.30pm. We raised these issues with the police commissioner,” he said.

Another restaurateur said the meeting with the police commissioner remained inconclusive as they were still confused about the course of action for sound permissions.

When contacted, Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham said, “We have advised restaurateurs to put peer pressure on hoteliers not following rules. They stated that they were following rules. I told them if that was the case, we will deploy manpower elsewhere.”

147,['26/02/2020'],Making Delhi world-class government priority: LG Anil Baijal,"Anil Baijal

NEW DELHI: Making Delhi a “world-class” city and a “classic example” of good governance will be the priority of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in the next five years, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal said on Tuesday.Addressing the newly elected legislators on the second day of the seventh Delhi assembly’s first session, Baijal also appealed to people to maintain “peace, law and order, communal harmony” in view of the violence in north-east Delhi over the amended citizenship law and urged them to cooperate with security agencies.Outlining the government’s priorities, Baijal said the current dispensation would “focus on further consolidation of welfare activities” such as 200 units of free electricity, 20 kilolitres of free water, free bus ride for women, quality education and infrastructure, mohalla clinics, highest minimum wages in the country, doorstep delivery of services and the free pilgrimage scheme for senior citizens.The government’s commitment towards the welfare of people, Baijal pointed out, got reflected in the “10 guarantees” made in the run-up to February’s assembly elections. These include 24-hour electricity supply apart from undergrounding of cables; 24-hour clean piped water to every household; quality education to all till graduation; cheap, accessible and better healthcare; largest and cheapest transport system; pollution-free, clean and beautiful Delhi; women’s safety; basic infrastructure in unauthorised colonies; and pucca houses for slum dwellers. The government will also take “further action to make Delhi a world-class city”, he added.The government’s focus on getting “equal and fair” share in central taxes and funds for the municipal corporations as per the central finance commission’s recommendations also featured in the speech. The AAP government has repeatedly complained about Delhi’s share being stuck at Rs 325 crore since 2001 though the citizens of Delhi pay about Rs 1.5 lakh crore in taxes.“Equal and fair share for Delhi like other states in central taxes is essential for economic development. Prior to 2001, there was a system of sharing central taxes for the development of Delhi. To get it re-established and provide funds to the corporations... are among the priorities of my government,” the LG said.Baijal also sought cooperation of the newly elected members — a combination of veteran, experienced and first-timers — “to realise the dreams of the people of Delhi of living in a city, which is caring and productive, which embraces change and nurtures talent to make our life environmentally sustainable and prosperous”.The three-day session will conclude on Wednesday with the election of the deputy speaker and the motion of thanks on the LG’s address.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74314034,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-491021,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/making-delhi-world-class-govt-priority/articleshow/74308921.cms

Cooling heads: Safwan, a volunteer, sprays water on people sitting under the hot sun at the protest against CA... Read More

MANGALURU: A united political campaign should be launched against the BJP , which is trying to garner votes through divisive politics in the name of CAA , NRC and NPR , said activist B R Bhaskar Prasad .

In his keynote address at a protest rally organised by the Muslim Aikyatha Vedike at Kudroli on Tuesday, Prasad said the BJP has lost two major sources of their vote bank – Ayodhya and Gau Mata. Hence the BJP has devised CAA, NRC and NPR to divide people and thereby ensure their vote bank stays intact in the next Lok Sabha election, he said.

“For many years, the BJP used Ayodhya for their political mileage. However, they have lost it after the Supreme Court delivered a verdict. They were also playing politics in the name of cows, but their political motive behind it has already been exposed. They have been considering cows as gau mata, but they are silent about six major companies that are exporting 1.5 lakh tonnes of beef a day. None of those exporters are Muslims and Dalits. Now the BJP wants to create a burning issue to ensure their victory in future. Hence, they have devised CAA, NRC and NPR to divide people and ensure their victory in the next Lok Sabha election,” he said, and appealed to people to be cautious about the consequences of the implementation of it.

The proposed citizenship laws of the government will affect not only Muslims. It will have worse impact on Hindus, especially, Dalits, backward communities, tribals and all citizens, who are homeless, he said, adding, “Let Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah show their educational qualifications before asking us for our documents.”

The organisers had named the protest venue after Nauseen Kudroli and Jaleel Bengre, who died in the police firing during an anti-CAA protest in Mangaluru on December 19, 2019. On the police firing, Prasad said, “I apologise before the kin of Nauseen and Jaleel that our system killed them.”

Religious preacher H I Sufiyan Sakhafi said though India has many religions, castes and sub-castes, it was Dr B R Ambedkar who made the nation a sovereign socialist secular democratic republic. “We love the Constitution of India and we will protect it at any cost by dedicating our lives. In the history of India, we cannot find a government policy that offered citizenship to people on the basis of their religion. We will not allow this anti-constitutional rule,” he added. Former minister U T Khader spoke on the occasion.

Former Union minister Uma Bharti and BJP state chief VD Sharma

BHOPAL: Former Union minister Uma Bharti on Tuesday reached BJP state headquarters to meet newly-appointed BJP state chief V D Sharma .

“Promises made by the Congress-led state government to the people of Madhya Pradesh were not fulfilled. People feel betrayed and cheated. Law and order situation has also turned worse as crimes are being reported from places close to police stations. We have fought for the interests of the people without being in power for a long time, achieving the objectives and goals. We lost our government and pride after losing the last assembly election. We are not in power today, but will force the Congress government to fulfil promises it made to the people,” said Bharti.

A day before, Sharma had a close-door meeting with former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and former Rajya Sabha member Kailash Sarang. However, he could not meet Uma Bharti at her official residence.

Uma is happy with changes made in the state organisation and extended support to Sharma, said sources.

“The organisation, which was nurtured and nourished by our ideologues —Kushabhau Thakre and Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia —has made a right choice to preserve the culture and courage of the party. VD Sharma, being a capable grassroots worker, has all the qualities of a good leader and being a capable president. He won Lok Sabha election by a margin of 5 lakh votes. Under his leadership, we will see the BJP again in power,” Bharti said.

The BJP leader also added that she knew Sharma since 25 years and took the initiative for his marriage with Stuti (Sharma’s wife), who is daughter for her old friend. Sharma said that he was overwhelmed by Bharti’s gesture and always respected her as a senior party leader.

GUWAHATI: The panel set up by the ministry of home affairs ( MHA ) to recommend ways to implement Clause-6 of the Assam Accord to provide constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to the indigenous Assamese people submitted its report to chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal here on Tuesday.

Sonowal is expected to send the report to Union home minister Amit Shah soon but the recommendations, which are a result of the Assam Accord of 1985, will not be binding on the Centre without screening and ratification by the Assam Assembly.

For 34 years, Clause-6 of the Accord for protection of the identity of Assamese people has not been touched by any government in the absence of an official definition for ‘Assamese people’.

“MHA will examine and see if the recommendations are within the ambit of the Constitution or if there are any recommendations going against any judgment of the Supreme Court, which cannot be implemented. MHA also has to send back the recommended definition of the ‘Assamese people’ to the Assembly. The Assembly will then discuss the definition and give its approval before it can be implemented,” minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

Three leaders of All Assam Students’ Union (Aasu), who are members of the panel, did not attend the handing over function to register their protest against the report being submitted to the chief minister and not the Union home minister.

“The Union home minister had shown so much of interest when he announced the setting up of the panel, but now he has no time for the panel to accept its report,” Aasu chief advisor Samaujjal Bhattacharyya said.

Justice (retd) B K Sharma , who led the high-level committee, said: “The report was prepared in time, but as it has not been made public and is yet to be handed over to the Union home minister, it will not be prudent on my part to divulge anything.”

He said the panel deliberated on the various clauses of the Assam Accord, visited places in Assam, and received more than 1,200 representations and talked to various stakeholders for preparing the report.

Sharma said, “There were two things — to suggest ways for safeguards to Assamese people and give a definition of Assamese people, who will get the safeguards.”

He added, “We have also given a cut-off date for identifying an Assamese. Various suggestions were received… some wanted that it should be 1826, the year of the Treaty of Yandabo — when Burma agreed to cede to the British-Assam, Manipur, Rakhine (Arakan) and the Taninthayi (Tenasserim) coast south of the Salween River . Some others wanted it to be 1950 when India became a republic and some suggested 1971 (the cut-off date for determining an illegal migrant as per the Assam Accord). We examined all suggestions and arrived at a date we thought was right.”

Hyderabad: Plans to revamp the historic Monda Market have hit a roadblock. In spite of eviction notices being served to vendors multiple times, even in September last year, the vendors have stood their ground.

The Monda Market is a heritage structure which was constructed in 1880. All the shops, stalls were allotted during 1954 to persons on a lease basis for one year, subject to certain lease terms and conditions. In 2011, rents were enhanced for 384 units of the market.

Citing high court orders in 2009, officials state that, “No renewal of lease is permitted even with the sanction of government for a period beyond twenty-five years without conducting public auction.”

Terming the vendors as “unauthorized tenants”, the government directed that eviction notices be issued, but with the stall owners standing firm, the revamp of the market will take longer.

Yadagiri Rao, additional commissioner, estates, GHMC, however said, “Plans were going as per schedule and evictions will take another month.” He said engineers will be roped in for a design for the revamp once the eviction is completed.

Vendors however, have remained steadfast in their protest. Venkat Mohan, state president, Telangana Street Vendors and Hawkers Trade Union, said, “Section 3(3) of the Street Vendors (Protection Of Livelihood and Regulation Of Street Vending) Act 2014 clearly says that no street vendor can be evicted or relocated till two surveys are completed. An ID card and vending certificates have to be issued to them.”

He added that unless a suitable location is provided to the hawkers and benefits of various schemes are provided to them, any move would be illegal.

Vijayawada: The high court on Tuesday ordered Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct an inquiry into the alleged illegal detention of three persons by Guntur urban police and submit a report by June 17.

The high court had earlier ordered a judicial inquiry into the issue.

The police, however, had opposed the judicial inquiry report alleging that it had not taken facts into account. With the police opposing the judicial inquiry report, the high court said it will order a CBI inquiry, which the police did not object to.

The high court directed the CBI to conduct an inquiry and asked them to submit the report by June 17.

The Guntur urban CCS police allegedly took N Adinarayana, R Srinivasa Rao and T Srinivasa Rao into custody on charges of cricket betting in October, last year. However, after they did not return home, their wives lodged a missing complaint with Pattabhipuram police station and later also met Guntur urban SP P H D Ramakrishna.

After the police failed to respond, the wives of the missing persons filed habeas corpus petitions in the high court seeking directions to the police to present their husbands before the court.

The high court heard the matter on October 31 and the government pleader sought time to submit details.

On the same day, Chebrole police produced the three missing persons before Guntur court. The three accused deposed before the court that they have been in police custody since October 14 and the same was recorded by the magistrate.

Nimmagadda Venkateswarlu, the advocate for the petitioners submitted the statements of the accused to the high court and said that the police have put them under illegal detention without producing them before the court.

Taking a serious note of the issue, the high court directed the Guntur principal senior civil judge to conduct an inquiry and submit a report on the role of police officers connected to the matter. The judicial inquiry report was submitted to the high court on Tuesday.

156,['26/02/2020'],Quota above 50% in local bodies: HC to hold fresh hearing,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Vijayawada: The high court on Tuesday reserved orders on a batch of petitions challenging implementation of reservations in panchayat elections over and above 50 per cent.

Earlier, the high court had reserved the orders after hearing both sides. The high court, however, decided to conduct fresh hearing as the applicability and power under section 202-A of Andhra Pradesh Panchayat Raj Act 1994 and three other judgments given by the high court in similar matter were not covered in earlier arguments and needs to be verified to come to a conclusion.

Earlier, the petitioners argued that providing reservations more than 50% was a violation of Supreme Court judgments. They argued that the providing reservations beyond the set limit would violate the rights of others and would deny them equal rights given under the Constitution. On Tuesday, the high court bench headed by the Chief Justice J K Maheswari and Ninala Jayasurya held a fresh hearing on the matters related to section 202-A of Panchayat Raj Act.

The bench asked about the basis for reaching at a little over 59% reservations in local bodies. The HC also asked about Section 202-A of Andhra Pradesh Panchayat Raj Act which says the reservations to backward castes should be provided based on socio economic survey by Andhra Pradesh Backward Classes Co-operative Finance Corporation Limited.

Replying to the bench, advocate general S Sriram said that the reservations were based on 2011 census and the population of backward classes in the state is more than what is being given by the state government. He argued that in special circumstances the state government can provide reservations over and above 50% for equal representation of all.

157,['26/02/2020'],Kerala: Arooja’s school functioned ignoring shutdown notice,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Illustration used for representational purpose

KOCHI: Arooja’s Little Stars School (ALSS), Mattancherry, which landed in a controversy after 29 Class X students of the school missed the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) board exam this year due to lack of affiliation, has not met any of the requirements mentioned in the CBSE Affiliation Bye Law 2018, said district education officials.

The district education officer (DEO) has rejected the school’s application for government recognition and no objection certificate (NOC) multiple times citing the lack of basic infrastructure prescribed by the CBSE. The latest rejection letter was issued in May 2019. Moreover, the school had been reportedly operating illegally after ignoring a shutdown notice issued by the deputy director of education (DDE) in October 2017 due to the lack of recognition and affiliation.

According to the rejection order issued by the DEO Ernakulam, which was accessed by TOI, the school failed to meet 11 requirements considered mandatory for the affiliation. “ALSS is situated on less than seven cents whereas the CBSE affiliation requirement is two acres. Also, the school does not have its own road and is using the paths used by the nearby residents. Playground is necessary for CBSE affiliation and the school lacks one,” the order said.

The school authorities did not mention the dimensions of the classrooms while submitting the application and a few classes were conducted on the two floors of a residential building. There is no building plan submitted by the management. Also, it has not submitted the fire safety certificate from fire and rescue department.

“Above all, the teachers in the school must have to be qualified as per the National Council for Teacher Education standards and ALSS could not provide any proof for the same qualifications of teachers. Also, the teaching or non-teaching staff should have the same remuneration as those working in corresponding government schools. ALSS failed to submit proofs for this too,” said the order.

A traffic policeman wears a face mask to protect from pollution (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Delhi topped the list of most polluted capital cities in the world in 2019, according to a new report, which also revealed that 21 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities were in India. Ghaziabad , meanwhile, had the dubious distinction of being the most polluted city in the world.

According to the World Air Quality Report 2019, compiled by IQAir Air Visual, Ghaziabad was followed by Hotan in China, and then Gujran-wala and Faisalabad in Pakistan. Delhi took the fifth place.

Track the pollution level in your city

The 21 Indian cities named in the list in the order of their ranking were Ghaziabad, Delhi, Noida, Gurugram, Greater Noida, Bandhwari, Lucknow, Bulandshahr, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Jind, Faridabad, Coraut, Bhiwadi, Patna, Palwal, Muzaffarpur, Hisar, Kutail, Jodhpur and Moradabad.

As per the country-wise data, India ranked fifth in the world’s most polluted countries with Bangladesh taking the top spot, followed by Pakistan, Mongolia and Afghanistan.

The report, however, also mentions that Indian cities have shown improvement compared with last year. “Whilst cities in India, on average, exceed the World Health Organisation target for annual PM2.5 exposure by 500%, national air pollution decreased by 20% from 2018 to 2019 with 98% of the cities experiencing improvement,” the report stated.

Frank Hammes, IQAir CEO said, “While coronavirus is dominating international headlines, a silent killer is contributing to nearly seven million more deaths a year that is air pollution. The gap in air quality data in large parts of the world poses a serious problem, as what is not measured cannot be managed.”

Avinash Chanchal, senior campaigner at Greenpeace India, said the steps being taken to control pollution were not sufficient. “In Delhi, be it bypass roads, shutting down of Badarpur power plant, shifting industries to PNG and BS-VI mandate have had result in reduction of pollution levels on an annual average basis, but the latest World Air Quality Report is an indication that the steps taken are not sufficient,” he said.

Jaipur: The forest department is in the process of digitizing all the wildlife and forest offences that were until now registered manually.

The digitization will be done only for the pending cases up to 2016, and from 2017 till now, all the cases irrespective of their status will be uploaded. The department will do the same for forest areas where there is encroachment.

G V Reddy, principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF) told TOI, “Till now, all the cases of forest and wildlife offences were maintained in a register manually at the district level. However, we are now in the process of digitizing them, in order to analyse the type of offences and the number which is pending along with the reasons for the same. With one click, we will be able to see all the cases, which was not possible till now. We are very serious about curbing such offences and this would help us in doing so,” Reddy said.

The matter was discussed during a video conference meeting of officials on forest protection held on Tuesday.

The data will be uploaded for the last ten years, though only the pending cases till 2016 will be digitised. “After 2016, all the cases whether the investigation has been completed or pending will be uploaded. This would help us in identifying the repeat offenders as well so that we can take the needful action,” added Reddy.

The department will also identify the areas where forest has been encroached upon, as well as have a digital record of the same. Elaborating further, the top forest official said, “Forest encroachment is also an offence and till now, the data was only on register. We will make it digital and also mark the encroached areas so they are visible on Google so that we can see them virtually. Up till now, they are not visible in this manner.”

DEHRADUN: Images of more than a dozen snow leopards have been captured in the cameras installed in the hill areas of the state by the forest department last year. These pictures are of great significance, say forest officials, considering that the snow leopard is an extremely elusive animal.

“We have spotted around four snow leopards in Malari; two each in the valley of flowers, Gorso, and Alaknanda forest division; and around three outside valley of flowers. The movement of these snow leopards was captured in the cameras last year. The evidence of their presence in these areas had also been confirmed by our patrolling team this year,” said Kishan Chand, divisional forest officer (DFO) of Chamoli.

A World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) team, which had installed cameras in Pithoragarh’s Gori Valley, has also claimed to have found the presence of a few snow leopards in the area. Rishi Kumar Sharma, head of WWF’s Snow Leopard Conservation Programme, told TOI, “We sighted six snow leopards in a 150 square kilometre long area in Pithoragarh’s Gori valley. We are confident that their numbers are higher as only 10 camera traps were installed and that, too, in a small area. Our focus was on conservation planing and examining opportunities for continued co-existence between people and snow leopards in that region.”

He added that government of India has embarked on an ambitious national snow leopard population estimation program using camera traps and genetic surveys which are widely accepted scientific tools to reliably estimate snow leoaprd population. ""The current natioanl estimates of snow leoaprd numbers are gudestimates and the curent thrust on sing accepted scientific methods will help us determine snow leopard numbers with confidence.” said Sharma.

Notably, Uttarakhand has already trained its DFOs in implementation of snow leopard estimation project in February and has become the first state in the country to spearhead the programme.

He added that estimating the number of snow leopards through camera traps is not really a scientific method. “Their population count, estimated on the basis of camera traps, is just guesswork,” said Sharma.

Notably, Uttarakhand has already trained its DFOs in implementation of snow leopard estimation project in February and has become the first state in the country to spearhead the programme. At Wildlife Institute of India , officials were recently given insights on camera estimation works. “We will be engaging local youths and non-government organisations for the estimation works. But we will first educate our officers so that they further dispense the knowledge,” said RK Mishra, chief conservator of forests, Uttarkhand forest department.

S Sathyakumar, senior scientist at Wildlife Institute of India, told TOI that Uttarakhand has a significant population of snow leopards. Kumar, who has been working in the snow-leopard belts of the country for several years, told TOI, “We estimate there are around 500-700 snow leopards in the country roughly. Out of this, about 85 would be in Uttarakhand. WII worked intensively for four years in areas above Bhagirathi and captured evidence of presence of snow leopards. A protocol for snow leopard number estimation has also been developed now.”

Kumbhalgarh fort.

JAIPUR: The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has written to the chief wildlife warden of Rajasthan to look into the possibility of upgrading Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary into a tiger reserve. The letter dated February 10 asked the forest department to explore the possibility keeping in view the core buffer strategy and landscape approach towards tiger conservation. NTCA has sought a detailed report in this regard.

The letter read that in the 17th meeting of NTCA held on January 6, Dungarpur MP Harshvardhan Singh had expressed his opinion that the sanctuary be notified as tiger reserve to accommodate the rising population of the big cat in the state.

Rajasthan forest department had already initiated the process to upgrade the sanctuary in Rajsamand district into another tiger reserve.

A final proposal had been submitted to chief wildlife warden for the same. Following the state government’s direction, assessment report on the potential for relocation of the big cats at the sanctuary was prepared by the department. “We are already working on the possibility of upgrading the sanctuary and will reply to NTCA with the detailed report. A draft proposal has been ready for a while,” said Arindam Tomar, chief wildlife warden.

According to the draft, the name of the area is proposed to be Kumbhalgarh Tiger Reserve which will constitute Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, Todgarh-Raoli Wildlife Sanctuary and adjoining forest areas. The area of the proposed reserve is 1280.49 square km, out of which 355.25 square km will be the core area and 925 square km as buffer area in phase I.

The highlight of the proposed tiger reserve is that there are no revenue village in the core area. The proposed reserve lies in the districts of Pali, Rajsamand, Udaipur and Ajmer and is located in the oldest range of Aravallis spreading over the tract starting from Khulbrahora (Gujarat) and culminating on Delhi ridge. Once, tigers used to roam in the natural forests of Kumbhalgarh and Raoli-Todgarh. The habitat of both the sanctuaries is suitable to tigers, other predators and its prey base. Also, a corridor connects both the sanctuaries.

Vijayawada: Residents of Bharati Nagar and surrounding colonies have demanded that the district administration and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) restore the service road adjacent to Benz Circle Flyover at its starting point near Vinayak Theatre junction. Locals urged the government to implement the high court’s order to restore the service road immediately.

Benz Circle Flyover reduces traffic on the busy ring road from Ramavarappadu junction to Skew Bridge. The flyover’s construction, however, congested the service road from Novotel Hotel to Gunrunanal College Centre. After a trial run was done on the flyover, officials built a wall blocking traffic through the congested service road. Officials who initially proposed to acquire land from around 25 building owners to expand the service road for a stretch of 800 meters, dropped the idea given the cost of land.

“We have lost direct connectivity with the road. We are travelling double the distance to reach a place which is just 500 meters away from our place. Officials were hesitating to come forward for the construction of the service road as the market value of land in the area is around Rs 1 lakh per square yard. But the government should solve our problem,” said K Narayana Kumar a local. Krishna administration clarified the court directed them to restore road within three months and the works would begin soon.

The NGT had earlier asked to submit details about the project after two petitions were moved opposing the proposed lift irrigation project. While the state government argued that it is part of the Polavaram project to supply drinking water, the petitioners argued that the Detailed Project Report (DPR) says that it is an irrigation project.

The NGT had also directed all works of the project be halted following the show cause notice issued by MoEF for non-compliance of environmental norms. The NGT found fault with the state government for submiting a report with misleading facts.

The National Green Tribunal further stated in its order that as it was clear that the said project was an irrigation project, it needs to be examined whether an independent EC is required or an amendment to the earlier EC given to the Polavaram project has to be obtained. The Central Pollution Control Board will act as the nodal agency of the committee constituted to determine the same.

NEW DELHI: “Agar mere saamne koi mar jaata, toh bahut dukh hota hamesha... (had anyone died in front of me, it would have hurt me forever),” head constable Deepak Dahiya (31) told TOI on Tuesday. A day earlier, Dahiya had come face to face with a rioter, who pointed a pistol at him even as he himself stood defiant with just a lathi in hand.Dahiya hails from Sonepat and was inducted into Delhi Police in 2010 as a constable. He cleared the exam for the post of head constable and is currently undergoing training at Wazirabad.Recalling the events of Monday that catapulted him to front page of newspapers, Dahiya said: “I was deployed at Maujpur Chowk. Things suddenly took an extremely violent turn and people started pelting stones at each other. As I moved towards the scene of violence, I heard a gunshot. I saw a man wearing a red sweatshirt... he was wielding a pistol. I immediately jumped to the other carriageway to divert his attention.”Live: Army should be called in, Kejriwal saysDahiya explained that in such situations, a cop is trained to put the lives of civilians above his own. “He was charging ahead... I walked up to him to divert his attention.. I could not have allowed anyone else to come in his way. My priority was to ensure that there was no casualty,” he said. Asked what was going in his mind at that particular moment, Dahiya said: “Kaam hain mera, karna hi hai... (it is my job and I have to do it).”Dahiya’s wife and two daughters reside in Sonepat, along with the rest of his family. Till Tuesday morning, they were unaware that he had come this close to death. “I did not tell them anything, but my photograph went viral on the social media. My wife called me up all worried. I tried to dodge her questions, but even though my face wasn’t visible in the photographs, she recognised me from the blue stripes on the jacket... I kept quiet as I know that she has full confidence in me,” he said.Dahiya hails from a family of men in uniform. His father retired from Indian Coast Guard. He has two younger brothers: one is with Delhi Police and the other is with the coast guard.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74310842,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-187893,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/couldnt-have-let-anyone-come-in-his-way-cop-who-faced-the-barrel/articleshow/74308959.cms

Visakhapatnam: The state women and child welfare minister Taneti Vanitha said her department would arrange CCTV cameras in Anganwadi centers. Even though the state government has been implementing many schemes to provide nutritious food, 100% services are not reaching the public due to loopholes in the system, she said.

After holding a review meet with north Andhra districts officials of her department here on Tuesday, the minister asked the officials to find out the loopholes and take proper action to address the needs of the beneficiaries. She instructed the officials to distribute rewards to efficient workers as incentives and send warnings and counseling officers negligent towards its duties. The minister ordered the RJDs and PDs to monitor and conduct surprise checks at the centers.

The minister also reviewed the vacancies, promotions and appointments in the department and reviewed ongoing constructions and condition of basic amenities at the centers.

175,['26/02/2020'],Hushed up! Kidnapping cases in Kochi drop as parents cop out,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Illustration used for representational purpose

KOCHI: Ernakulam Rural police has recorded a steady rise in the number of kidnappings and abductions over the past five years even as Kochi city police numbers show a decline.

According to the latest report of the District Crime Records Bureau, a total of 37 kidnapping cases were reported in rural areas of the district 2019. Of these, 27 involved a woman or girl victim. In 2016, the total number of cases stood at 11.

The city police registered 13 cases in 2015. This dropped to six in 2019, after rising to 19 in 2017.

According to police officials, the majority of such abductions involve sexual abuse. “We invoke IPC sections 370 (trafficking) and 363 (kidnapping) along with offences like rape and child abuse. This is actually a graver offence as the victim is not in a position to give consent or is tricked into being taken somewhere,” said M J Sojan, additional superintendent of police, Ernakulam.

Experts say the higher numbers in rural areas is because it is difficult to hush up such cases in such neighbourhoods. Fr Jenson Varyath, director of Ernakulam Childline, said city parents are less likely to come out and report such an offence than those in rural areas. “Now, due to various awareness drives, more cases of sexual abuse are getting reported in rural areas. It is difficult to keep things quiet in a rural neighbourhood as compared to the city where things can be kept under wraps. Also, parents are not that forthcoming in reporting such crimes in the city,” said Fr Varyath.

Police say most of the kidnapping cases in the district involve either minor girls cheated on the pretext of love or women given false promises, including of marriage, and are taken to various locations where they are sexually assaulted.

ASP Sojan added that officers realizing the need for adding the charge of abduction to sexual abuse cases due to the efforts of police wings like the anti-human trafficking unit is also another reason for the spike in rural areas. P S Muhammed Ashraf, a police official who works with the special juvenile police unit (SJPU), said there have been instances where child labourers were rescued, only to reveal a kidnapping or abduction angle.

“In many cases, follow-up investigations would suggest that the children were trafficked from other states or other districts. In such cases too, FIRs are registered for kidnapping and abduction,” said Ashraf.

Moreover, Bindu P A, special public prosecutor with the Ernakulam Pocso court, said that about 40% of abuse cases get settled due to various reasons, such as the victim refusing to go forward with the complaint.

“At least in Ernakulam, most cases with enough evidence lead to conviction. In fact, around six in 10 cases lead to conviction. However, due to the vast area that comes under the Ernakulam court, there are around 450 cases which are pending,” said Bindu.

Hyderabad: A week after a bid was made on the lives of two siblings at Gandimaisamma in Quthbullapur , four persons were arrested on Tuesday. A manhunt is on to apprehend five other assailants in the attempt to murder case.

The arrested persons were K Shiva, S Rajkumar, K Srisailam and K Balaraj of Gandipet. Narsingi police said following the orders of Ashok Yadav , who lost in the recent municipal elections from ward No. 17 in Narsingi municipality, the four accused along with their associates — Gowtham, Srikanth, Sateesh Yadav and Mahesh Yadav — attacked K Anand and his brother Raj Kumar with an axe, beer bottles and sticks.

After losing the elections, Ashok met the winning TRS candidate Venkatesh Yadav. Venkatesh’s followers — Anand and Raj Kumar — roughed up Ashok and a case was registered at Komuravelli police station, Madhapur ACP N Shyam Prasad Rao said.

Ashok hatched a plan with his associates and attacked Anand when the latter was travelling from Gandimaisamma to Kokapet on February 18.

“Upon hearing from his brother about the attack, Raj came to his rescue. The assailants targeted Raj also. He fell unconscious. The attackers fled from the scene thinking that he had died. Anand and Raj are out of danger. Based on their complaint, we arrested the four accused,” the ACP said. A hunt is on to nab the other accused, including Ashok.

Hyderabad: Even as the row over providing MSP for turmeric farmers is refusing to die down, procurement of red gram has become a headache for the state government and Markfed.

Currently, 24,000 metric tonnes of red gram procured by Markfed last year at a cost of Rs 200 crore is lying in the godowns. But the state government is yet to give permission to sell the produce in the market.

As 1.5 lakh MTs of red gram remained unsold by the farmers this year, the state government is worried about disposal of the produce. The Centre was ready to procure 47,000 MTs only.

“One lakh MTs of red gram will still be with farmers. We are already under pressure from the farmers to procure the produce,” a highly-placed official said. Farmers have been assured Rs 5,000 per qunital.

Markfed is also worried, with traders quoting only Rs 4,200 per quintal. It had purchased the produce from farmers at Rs 5,675 per quintal. Overall, Markfed spent Rs 7,000 on each quintal, factoring in the transport charges.

Though the state government has written to the Centre on additional purchase of red gram, there no response has been received yet.

This has left the farmers worried. “Private buyers quote much lesser price. The state government does not allow the traders to directly buy from us. We are caught between the devil and the deep sea,” A Srikanth Reddy, a farmer from Yadadri district said.

Irate farmers burnt several bags of red gram at Mothkuru market on Monday.

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy released a promotional video on Tuesday featuring Sindhu, where she exhorts the public to lodge complaints against any form of corruption.

“Corruption-free Andhra Pradesh is the vision of our chief minister. If anybody seeks bribe or indulges in graft, please call toll-free number 14400,” she says in the video.

Jagan said the menace of corruption has to be rooted out completely. “Whether it is a small work or real-time insurance, only graft seems to be working.

179,['26/02/2020'],Kadavumbhagam synagogue: More funds sanctioned for restoration work,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Kadavumbhagam synagogue

KOCHI: A major hurdle for restoration of the 600-year-old Kadavumbhagam synagogue at Mattancherry, which collapsed partially during the rains in September 2019, has been overcome with the cultural affairs department sanctioning the additional amount required for acquiring 0.0351 hectares lying adjacent to the monument.

Though the state archaeology department had provided administrative sanction for Rs 91.45 lakh for land acquisition and credited the amount to the account of Ernakulam district collector, the process could not be completed because the total cost was estimated to be Rs 1,67,22,956 after adding five percentage contingency charge of Rs 7,96,331.

The cultural affairs department has now sanctioned Rs 75,77,956 after subtracting the Rs 91.45 lakh sanctioned earlier. The synagogue was the historical place of worship of Malabari Jews.

The ownership of the synagogue changed hands after Malabari Jews, who took care of the building, immigrated to Israel. The ownership of the monument was with Vanaja Traders, a coir trading company for a while. The property adjacent to the monument is currently owned by Regina Tharyan, but under the possession of Punjab National Bank as it was mortgaged for loan.

“We have already declared it as a monument but the final notification is yet to be made. We would be able to do the restoration work only after the final notification is made,” said archaeology department director K R Sona. The structure’s front portion collapsed in heavy rain on September 10, 2019. A portion of the synagogue was pulled down overnight by some unknown persons in 2015. Heritage conservationists had long been demanding that authorities take measures for the upkeep of the structure.

180,['26/02/2020'],Machines spearhead Chennai corporation’s Swachh Bharat mission,"Proposals worth Rs 200 crore are in the pipeline to procure mini amphibians which clean smaller waterbodies.

CHENNAI: If you are a regular visitor to the Marina beach , you might have noticed that the sand has been levelled with a machine. In the northern part of the city, sanitary workers collecting garbage from homes in narrow streets feel more dignified because they are no longer ‘kuppa vandi’ drivers, but move around in battery-operated vehicles.Both are part of Greater Chennai Corporation big push towards mechanisation of its core activities of cleaning and maintaining hygiene.Proposals worth Rs 200 crore are in the pipeline to procure mini amphibians which clean smaller waterbodies, robotic excavators which will dig deep into canals and bring out waste buried for years, and high pressure jet-rodding machines which will de-silt choked drains. Funds have been obtained from the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), with a small contribution from the corporation’s own reserves.The work where machines will replace humans ranges from pruning of tree branches that are at a height of 30 feet to sweeping roads, picking up finer waste particles from the road and converting non-biodegradable waste into saleable items. The beach-cleaning machine, six of which are deployed at the Marina and two at Elliot’s Beach, can sweep three acres of wet and dry beach sand every hour and comes equipped with a tipper lorry to dump the collected waste.Officials said in three years, Chennai would see a marked improvement in nationwide cleanliness rankings, while markers on health and hygiene would also show a considerable improvement as machines will dig out dirt from places hitherto unexplored.“A human sweeper is paid Rs 300 to clean 500 metres of a road. A mechanical sweeper will do it in a more efficient manner and cover a larger area,” an official said.A robotic excavator will get into a canal and dig out garbage dumped many years ago. The earlier practice was to send men in catamarans.“Not only is this hazardous to the men, they would not be able to plumb the depths that an excavator can. Also, while desilting water bodies, we will be able to quantify the amount of silt that has been dug out,” said another official.Apart from safety of workers, some machines support recycling of waste. Vehicle-mounted suction-cum-jet-rodding machines, seven of which have been procured at a cost of Rs 5.2 crore each, recycles water and sludge removed from a drain. The earlier model of this vehicle uses 90,000 litres of water per hour to create the water jet that will pierce the sludge. The recyclable machine uses 2,000 litres of water.P Nakkeeran, treasurer of anti-corruption NGO Arappor Iyakkam, welcomed the move towards mechanisation. “But as far as cleanliness of waterbodies is concerned, officials should also focus on removal of encroachments and cutting down on illegal sewage inflow. There should be transparency in how much these machines can be used,” he said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74310994,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-687184,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/machines-spearhead-corpns-swachh-bharat-mission/articleshow/74308968.cms

KT Rama Rao

HYDERABAD: Municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao said the government will soon issue orders to municipalities to stop collecting garbage if residents and house owners do not segregate waste.

Urging people to cooperate with the municipal authorities in keeping the towns clean, the minister said though the authorities had introduced a two-bin system for wet and dry waste and distributed bins, they are not being used by the residents.

The minister said the citizens will have to segregate waste so that sanitation workers could process the waste.

The minister, who took part in Pattana Pragathi programme at Devarakonda and Kalwakurthy towns on Tuesday, asked the officials to identify problems and address them immediately.

The minister had a word of advice for the local elected representatives. “There are no elections in the next four years. All we have to do is work hard to find a permanent place in the hearts of people,” he said and instructed councillors and ward committee members to identify the problems and start addressing them right away.

He asked the people to not pay bribes for getting building permissions from April 2 as the government is coming up with a new mechanism for building permissions.

“If you don’t get building permisssion within 21 days, the permission is deemed to be granted,” he said.

He laid the foundation stone for various development works in Devarakonda. These include construction of an underground drainage network, STP, roads and a park at a cost of Rs 48 crore.

The minister undertook a padayatra in the town. KTR later inaugurated a 32/11 KV sub-station in Kalwakurthy.

Meanwhile, finance minister Harish Rao also spoke about segregation of waste while interacting with councillors and residents in Sadasivpet in Sangareddy district. He asked the authorities to impose a fine of Rs 500 if people do not cooperate with the authorities in segregating waste.

He urged people to not dump garbage in open places and directed the officials to identify problems pertaining to electricity poles, roads and other civic issues in the town.

Vijayawada: World Bank has evinced interest in partnering with the state government in health and education sectors.

A team of officials from World Bank, led by Lynne Sherburne-Benz, regional director, Human Development, South Asia, held discussions with chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy on Tuesday, on the state government’s initiatives in various sectors besides administration decentralisation.

The team complimented the initiatives of the chief minister in health and education sector and showed interest in partnering with the government. The chief minister briefed them about the government’s plans in English medium education, skill development centers and renovation and strengthening of schools and hospitals under Naadu-Nedu scheme. He also told them that the government would soon start YSR Village Clinics across the state shortly where 24x7 medical and health services would be made available. He also told them that schools would get digital class rooms. The students would also get tabs with internet provision for e-learning, he said.

The chief minister briefed the team on village and ward secretariats and his plans to connect them with the state secretariat and the district collectorates. The village and ward secretariats would soon start registration activity so that people need not go to the offices of sub-registrars.

The skill development centers would come up in all Lok Sabha constituencies and they would be kept under one skill development university. These centers would upgrade the skills of the people according to the requirement of the industry, he told the team.

The CM explained to them the reasons to take up decentralisation of administration. He told them that the government would require at least Rs 2 crore to provide basic infrastructure of roads, drains, electricity and drinking water for every one acre of land in Amaravati. He said that this would mean concentration of development in one place, while the rest of the state is ignored. He had taken the decision to decentralise the administration to distribute the fruits of development to various places, he said.

The World Bank team was impressed with the initiatives of the government. The team members said that they were aware of the padayatra by Jaganmohan Reddy before the elections.

184,['26/02/2020'],A trip to Thailand proved that age is just a number,"This story is from February 26, 2020

It was always my dream to take my parents on a trip abroad. However, my dad passed away years ago, when I was quite young, and my dream took a backseat as I got busy with the challenges of life. But it was always there at the back of my mind, and I was determined to take my mother and show her a slice of the world. After much deliberation, I decided on Thailand and surprised my mother. I will never forget the look on her face when we reached Pattaya and she saw the speed boats scattered near the sea shore and the multi-coloured hot air balloons dotting the azure blue sky. My mum has always been scared of boats, but she managed beautifully on the speed boat that took us to Coral Island, even though we had to change multiple boats.

The years lifted off my mum’s face as we giggled and licked ice-creams of exotic flavours as we made our way through the mind-boggling malls of Bangkok. My mom forgot her knee-pain and laughed like an excited school-girl as we soaked in the sights and smells of Bangkok. She pointed out Kashmiri shawl sellers and Sardarji’s excitedly as they brought forth the familiarity of home in a strange country. She looked in amazement at the sky-scrapers of Bangkok and the huge bill boards and sky-walks. We often tend to think of old people as fixed in their view-points and unwilling to experiment, but my mum proved all that wrong. She sportingly tried the local Thai cuisine and even managed to fold her arthritic leg into a Tuk-Tuk that went so fast that we literally had to cling on to for life, since we were almost slipping off.

My mum loved the Bangkok city trip in which we visited monasteries and saw the Grand Palace of the Thai monarch. She listened eagerly to everything our guide told us and looked left and right to view all that there was to see. She encouraged me to talk to the local people and know about their life and habits. She felt that there was a lot of similarity with India and yet it was as abroad as abroad can be. Our short and sweet trip to Thailand is one of my most memorable trips that brought us closer and proved to me that age is just a number.

Visakhapatnam: The state prisons department is set to adopt the Tamil Nadu model of reforms to prevent convicted criminals from committing crimes.

Director General of Prisons and Correctional Services, Md. Ahsan Reza said the department would take care of convicts who have finished their jail term and rehabilitate them in various trades they have acquired at the correctional service centre and with the support of their families.

“Our teams will visit prisons in Tamil Nadu to observe their model before implement it in Andhra Pradesh. We chalking out plans to allow the family members to interact with the convicts and to organize a mela at the central prisons premises on August 15 or January 26 and invite the family members to interact with inmates in all the central jails,” said Reza.

On the increasing number of remand prisoners in jails and they going back to old days after released on bails, Reza said the majority of the remand prisoners stay only for a short time in prisons and the department have little time to correct them.

“Our priority is to study the convicts for their reform and rehabilitation. We will monitor the released convicts with the support of a few other departments,” Reza said.

IG Prisons G Jayavardhan, DIG of Prisons, Coastal Andhra Range Dr Indla Sreenivasa Rao and Superintendent of Vizag Central Prison, S Rahul said the AP Prisons Department has been providing skill development training for convicts under Skill India programme to increase revenue. They said these measures ensure that the convicted get some money during their time in jails and are able to find employment once they are released.

Reza inaugurated the spices processing unit at Vizag Central Prison. The unit has been set up with a cost of Rs 38 lakh to produce quality red chilli powder and turmeric powder. Plans are on to produce cumin, coriander, pepper and a few other spice powders.

Some convicts have been trained to operate the unit. The red chilli and turmeric powders produced in Vizag Central Prison will be used in all the prisons in the state and the remaining will be sold in retail markets in Vizag and other parts of the state under the brand name of Sudhar, Reza added.

Vijayawada: Even as the state government tries to introduce reforms in the education department to check the collection of exorbitant amounts of fees in private schools, many corporate institutions in the city expedited the 2020-21 admission process without permission in a bid to rake in large amounts in fees.

Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who promised to create a stress-free pocket-friendly education system in the state, constituted Andhra Pradesh School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APSERMC) to implement education reforms.

The state government conducted inspections in private and corporate schools collecting unreasonably high fees and barred them from conducting admissions till they were given grades fixing the fee pattern.

But the majority of corporate schools in the city are conducting admissions ignoring the directions. Parents were busy gathering reference letters of ministers and other VIPs to get admissions for their kids in corporate schools. “Marketing teams of corporate school managements were repeatedly contacting us for the admission of my son in high school. They are offering huge discounts if we take admission before the completion of the academic year,” said J Lakshmi Narasimha a private employee.

Student associations strongly condemned the early admissions.

“Many corporate schools in the city completed 50 per cent of admissions in their schools. They were trying to attract parents by offering huge discounts. The education department should take necessary measures to stop the admission process before regulating the fee structure,” said K Ramesh state secretary of the Student Federation of India. Krishna district education officer Rajya Lakshmi speaking with TOI requested parents not to take up early admissions in corporate schools.

“We have noticed that many private schools in Krishna district are running against rules. They are collecting exorbitant amounts in fees. We have started inspections as per the guidance of APSERMC and schools violating norms will lose their recognition soon. Parents will suffer if they got admission to such schools,” she pointed out. I have directed deputy education officers across the district to identify schools taking early admissions and initiate stringent action against them, Rajyalakshmi added.

Visakhapatnam: The state women and child welfare minister Taneti Vanitha said her department would arrange CCTV cameras in Anganwadi centers. Even though the state government has been implementing many schemes to provide nutritious food, 100% services are not reaching the public due to loopholes in the system, she said.

NEW DELHI: The scare over swine flu isn’t limited to the Supreme Court, where five judges are said to be infected with the viral illness.Across Delhi, at least 152 positive cases of the influenza virus — which took to epidemic proportions in 2009 and has since become a part of seasonal influenza — have been reported in the last two months.There are no deaths reported though, as per the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) — a central health body.Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, internal medicine at Indraprastha Apollo hospital said the sudden upsurge in cases could be due to a mutation of the virus. “All viruses change or mutate to adapt. We don’t know for sure but it’s possible that the H1N1 influenza virus has mutated, leading to higher rates of transmission,” he said.In the last two weeks, Chatterjee added, the hospital has admitted at least four to five persons suffering from severe symptoms of swine flu. “Most patients have mild symptoms like running nose, sore throat and fever. Admission is required in case of breathlessness or persons in extremes of age who need regular monitoring,” the doctor said.According to Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis C-Doc, those with existing illnesses such as diabetes are being advised to take preventive vaccination.Another doctor said symptoms of swine flu are similar to common flu and even the novel coronavirus infection, increasing the fear in the public.Last year, Delhi had reported 3,627 cases of H1N1 of which 31 persons had died. The death toll across the country was 1,218 in 2019, the NCDC data revealed.The latest update on H1N1 situation in the country shows 884 people have been diagnosed positive for H1N1 over the last one-and-a-half-months in the country and there have been 14 deaths. Tamil Nadu reported the maximum cases (172), followed by Delhi (152), Karnataka (151) and Telangana (148).The union health ministry issued a statement in the wake of five SC judges testing positive for swine flu. It stated that the court roons and residences of the judges were being sanitised.The ministry said H1N1 is a seasonal infection, which usually occurs every year with two peaks: once in January to March and the other between July to September. It advised people to maintain hand hygiene and avoid crowded places.“The symptoms of swine flu are similar to common viral illnesses. Patients feel lethargic, have high-grade fever and sore throat, among other symptoms. The treatment is mostly symptomatic,” said a doctor. He added that maintaining hygiene was the most important. “People should wash their hands at regular intervals with disinfectants. If there is prolonged fever, one must see a doctor and not ignore symptoms such as difficulty in breathing,” he said",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74313286,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-155316,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-150-swine-flu-cases-in-just-two-months/articleshow/74308974.cms

NEW DELHI: Though early on Tuesday, police forced back pro-CAA protesters from the temple on the main Maujpur-Jafrabad Road — the epicentre of the violence that has now engulfed entire northeast Delhi — the violence shifted to the inner lanes and across the Shahdara drain dividing the region both geographically and demographically.The situation remained tense through the day, with the confrontationists pelting stones at each other as early as 8am near the Maujpur-Babarpur metro station.When TOI reached the spot, it saw cops under attack from stone throwers on the rooftops in Kabir Nagar. While the bridge there was a no-man’s land, there were plumes of smoke above the houses on the inner lanes.TOI heard regular gunshots being fired. Dipak, his forehead bearing a vermillion tilak, had an injured hand wrapped up in a handkerchief. “They are shooting at us from the rooftops. Four people have been injured,” he claimed. Shantanu Mittal, who resides next to the metro station, was recording the scene from the terrace when the mob banged on his door. “I was scared and deleted all the videos,” he said.TOI saw another group preparing petrol bombs. They also used slings to attack those on the roofs. Journalists were warned not to film the scenes, and there was no security from the grossly inadequate police presence. Around 1.45pm, joint commissioner Alok Kumar arrived with four buses of personnel. Half an hour later, security personnel fired teargas shells at the pro-CAA protesters to push them back and relative calm prevailed for almost an hour.The road from Shani temple going to Ghonda was black with the ashes of goods looted from shops. Identifying himself as Gupta, one footwear seller, muttered, “They mistook my shop as belonging to the other community. I had only taken this on rent recently.” TOI saw elderly women guarding the shops while urging stick-wielding youngsters to spare them. “If we go away, we will lose our life savings,” remarked one of them.The rioters were targeting CCTV cameras to evade identification later. The owner of Shubham Collection store pleaded with them not to touch the shop as it belonged to “someone like you”. He, his wife and son chanted “Jai Shri Ram” to prove their credentials, but the cameras were nevertheless pulled down.Back near the temple, BJP functionary Jai Bhagwan Goyal arrived to placate the crowd. “People from the other community want to show us in poor light during President Trump’s visit. So let us have peace,” he implored, but the mob taunted him to come back and say such things when the other community was on the attack.Around 3.30pm Rapid Action Force contingents came, and used teargas to disperse the mob. A flag march from Kardampuri to Jafrabad followed amid reports of a quick-response team van set alight in Jafrabad. TOI also saw a Gramin Sewa vehicle and several motorcycles burning on the 100ft Road near Chhajupur.A senior police officer disclosed late at night that the arterial road, including the sit-in site of women at Jafrabad metro station, had been cleared and Section 144 of CrPC imposed in the area.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74310629,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-239737,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fire-spreads-as-cops-fail-to-stem-riot/articleshow/74308998.cms

Gautam Gambhir

NEW DELHI: As violence continued unabated in northeast Delhi on Tuesday, with the toll climbing steadily, BJP’s East Delhi lawmaker Gautam Gambhir demanded strict action against anyone who made “provocative” speeches. “Whoever, no matter which party he belongs to, whether he is Kapil Mishra or anyone else, who gives speeches to provoke people, should face action,” Gambhir told reporters after visiting injured policemen admitted at a private hospital in east Delhi.

Violence had erupted in parts of northeast Delhi soon after former MLA Kapil Mishra led a march near Maujpur on Sunday, protesting against blockage of two roads by anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protesters since Saturday night. Mishra had given a three-day ultimatum to Delhi Police to get the Jafrabad and Chand Bagh roads cleared, adding that those favouring CAA would otherwise take to the streets.

There was a strong backlash against Mishra on social media and elsewhere with many blaming him for the violence.

Mishra said on Tuesday that he had been getting threat calls from abroad. “Friends, I have been getting constant calls from the country and abroad and people are threatening to kill me. Asking to open closed roads is not a crime, supporting CAA is not an offence, speaking truth is not a crime. I don’t fear this massive hate campaign against me,” he tweeted on Tuesday.

Mishra had unsuccessfully contested the recent assembly polls on a BJP ticket from Model Town. He was debarred by the Election Commission for three days for making incendiary statements.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari had said last week that those who make such hate speeches should lose their legal right to contest elections. Seeking strict action against rioters on Tuesday, Tiwari said no leader should do something that “causes confusion” and sends the wrong message among people. “Everyone should refrain from making inflammatory statements,” he said.

Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta, however, has come out in defence of Mishra, saying that those blaming his party colleague keep quiet when leaders of other parties make provocative statements. “Some media friends and so-called intellectuals are saying that @KapilMishra_IND is responsible for violence in Delhi but keep quiet on statements made by people like Waris Pathan (of AIMIM). These people do not want to stop the violence but try to run their agenda in its fire,” said Gupta.

The leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, however, said home minister Amit Shah had already asked party leaders not to make provocative statements. Without naming Mishra, Bidhuri said every leader of BJP will have to follow Shah’s directions. After Gambhir’s statement, the BJP leadership issued directions to party functionaries against making statements on violence or participate in TV debates on the subject.

A senior party functionary, however, said what Gambhir had said was “correct”. He added: “Whoever makes such inflammatory statements should face the music.”

An under-construction building under the RAY project in Kochi

KOCHI: The apartment complex of 199 units being constructed for rehabilitating slum dwellers in the city is now estimated to cost Rs 21 crore more.

The original cost of the project, being implemented under Raji Awas Yojana (RAY), was Rs 14.73 crore. The work was awarded to a contractor in 2018 for Rs 18.6 crore.

With the latest revision the project cost has been pegged at Rs 39 crore. Now, the cost of an individual apartment with 300sq.ft built-up area would be around Rs 19.5 lakh. “We have revised the estimate to Rs 39 crore. We have sent the revised estimate to the government for its approval. The administrative sanction is also awiated,” an official with Kochi corporation said.

At the same time, works standing committee chairman P M Harris said officials with the local body are revising the estimates. “No project of the corporation has been initiated without a revised estimate. Officials keep revising estimates. We are laymen as far as the engineering side is concerned,” Harris said. “We designed the project so that many homeless families will have a roof over their heads. Kochi corporation authorities have approached Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML), the agency which is implementing the Smart City project in Kochi, for providing the additional funding of Rs 21 crore. But, CSML authorities said that they would allot the funds only if the state government approves the revised estimate.

The land where the project is coming up is owned by the corporation. “Average cost of construction excluding cost of land is around Rs 2,500 per sqft. Add to this Rs 500 per sqft for promotion,” an office-bearer of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) said. Even then, the cost of 300sq.ft apartments comes to just Rs 7.5 lakh. When asked about the break-up, the official said, “The cost includes facilities like sewage treatment plant, escalator etc.”

Corporation authorities have already identified 194 families living in the slums of Thuruthi colony in Mattancherry as beneficiaries. There is also a plan for constructing another apartment complex with 199 units at Mehboob colony in Mattancherry. Cochin Smart Mission Ltd is expected to fund construction of the second complex from its slum alleviation scheme.

According to deputy commissioner of police (crime and traffic) S Senthil, the murder came to light after a stray dog was found with a mutilated human arm that was in a decomposed state.

Local residents, who saw this, alerted the Alagapuram police, who retrieved a beheaded body. “The right arm was also chopped off. The person could have been murdered at least five days ago,” the officer said.

Police sent the body to the Salem government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital for postmortem and registered a case under Section 174 (unnatural death) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Police are yet to trace the head and arm. “The body was found with a khaki shirt. We suspect that the victim could have been an auto or a heavy vehicle driver. The murderer beheaded the body, which was set on fire, with an intention not to identify the deceased,” the officer said.

Hyderabad: Day’s after party leaders Shashi Tharoor and Sandeep Dikshit raised concerns over a leadership vaccum, senior Congress leaders in Telangana have expressed their loyalty with Rahul Gandhi and said that only he can arrest the grand old party’s political descent.

Party leaders from the state, under the banner of Congress Loyalists Forum, on Tuesday wrote a letter to party interim president Sonia Gandhi to hold an All India Congress Committee (AICC) meeting at the earliest and entrust party leadership to Rahul Gandhi.

“It is our sincere belief that the strengthening and revival of the party would only be possible under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi. A session of the AICC may be convened at the earliest to entrust the party leadership to Rahul Gandhi. We are writing this letter to echo the sentiments and views of the rank and file of the Congress party besides the people in general,” stated the loyalists in the letter.

The forum comprises of former ministers Marri Shashidhar Reddy and S Chandrasekhar, AICC secretary V Hanumanth Rao, All India Kisan Congress vice-president M Kodanda Reddy, AICC OBC cell vice-chairman P Vinay Kumar among others.

Rahul Gandhi had resigned as the AICC president after the party’s defeat in Lok Sabha elections of 2019. Sonia Gandhi was made interim president in August 2019.

NDMA former vice-chairman Marri Shashidhar Reddy told TOI that Nehru-Gandhi family members have pan India accessibility. Though the party has several good leaders, the charisma and acceptability of Gandhi family members is unparalleled, he said.

A protester holding a stick walks on a deserted road after clashes erupted in Delhi's Karawal Nagar

NEW DELHI: “If the firemen hadn’t fled, they would have been burnt alive along with their vehicles.” This startling revelation was made by a senior fire officer overseeing the firefighting operation at Gokulpuri market on Monday night.

Three fire tenders had been sent to douse several vehicles that had been set afire, but were stopped mid-way near Brahmpuri. The rioters not only set the tenders ablaze, but also attacked three firemen.

A fire officer was injured in the stone-pelting on Tuesday. Delhi Fire Service (DFS) teams responding to distress calls of arson were asked to abandon their vehicles in case of violence. Till Tuesday afternoon, the fire department had received 70 calls of vehicles or shops being set on fire across northeast Delhi.

DFS chief Atul Garg said more than 100 teams have been kept on standby. “The biggest challenge for us to reach the affected areas is violence. We have asked police to ensure the safety of our men before we send fire tenders,” he added.

Officials said they received the first call around 8.30pm on Monday about a fire at Gokulpuri tyre market . This was followed by several distress calls from Brahmpuri. “When our teams reached the road heading towards the market, they saw thick smoke billowing at many places. They were soon surrounded by a mob and dragged out of the fire engines. Some of them were thrashed,” said a fire officer managing the control room.

Through the night, DFS kept receiving calls about fires at Brahmpuri, Maujpur and Chand Bagh. “We informed police about our location, but at some places even they were outnumbered by the rioters,” said the officer.

The fire department has asked police to ensure that gas depots and fuel stations are made inaccessible to the rioters. “If any of them is set on fire, it will end in calamity as northeast Delhi is highly congested,” Garg said.

The fire stations in Bhajanpura, Karawal Nagar and adjoining areas have been shut down and the fire tenders shifted to another base.

Eluru: An 11-year-old girl was raped in Undrajavaram mandal in West Godavari .

Though the incident took place about four days back, it came to light on Tuesday after the child related the incident to the parents.

The accused is a distant relative of the minor girl.

The police, which have booked the accused under the POCSO act, said 30-year-old Durga Prasad had lured the girl and sexually assaulted her four days back when there was no one at home. Her father is a rickshaw-puller and her mother works in a spinning mill. As both of her parents stay away from home for a considerable period of time, she spends about four hours alone in the house after returning from school.

The accused had taken advantage of that.

The incident came to light as Prasad started to call the girl’s father regularly on the phone. Suspecting that something might be up, the parents questioned the girl, who, in turn, revealed the ordeal. They immediately lodged a complaint with the police. tnn

68-year-old Pramod Mahajan reached the city from Pune on Tuesday.

VISAKHAPATNAM: To spread awareness about the importance of organ donation, a 68-year-old farmer , who has already donated one of his kidneys , Pramod Mahajan has undertaken a solo motorbike ride across India, as part of Bharat Organ Yatra (BOY) - II. By May-end, Mahajan, who is from Dhavali village of Sangli district of Maharashtra, intends to cover 94 cities in 25 states — about 17,500 kms.

The biker and volunteer for Rebirth Foundation, who started from Pune on January 18, reached Visakhapatnam on Tuesday evening after covering over 4,000 kms across eight states.

In October 2000, he had donated his kidney to an army jawan in a Mumbai hospital. Speaking to TOI, Mahajan said, “Despite efforts of doctors and counsellors, people are still not aware about the necessity of donating organs. After I donated my kidney to an ailing ex-army man nearly 20 years ago, he became father of two children after 13 years of marriage. I realized I have not just saved his life, but two more beings got new life as well. That was a turning point in my life.”

During his first solo ride, Mahajan’s encouragement and awareness creation had resulted in around 250 police personnel in Bhopal pledging to donate organs in case of brain death. “In Indore, around 600 students had filled the form. I also record my journey through social media for more people to know. My tour featured in the Limca Book of Records,” said Mahajan.

The Jagannath temple in Puri

BHUBANESWAR: Even as Puri is getting a makeover as part of the government’s heritage corridor project surrounding the Jagannath temple, the shrine administration seems to have failed to safeguard hundreds of acres of land that belongs to the sibling deities.

In a written reply, law minister Pratap Jena told the assembly on Tuesday that the Jagannath temple administration owns 60,426.943 acres of land in 24 districts in Odisha. However, the shrine body possessed ownership records of only 34,803.013 acres. According to the minister’s reply, the temple administration is yet to take control of 25,623 acres. Temple sources said the 25,623 acres have been encroached upon.

“We (temple administration) have so far registered a total of 864 encroachment cases in different tehsils under the Jagannath Temple Act-1955, Section 16-A (1). Steps are being taken to get the 25,623 acres of land back,” Jena said.

The minister said Jagannath temple owns 395.282 acres of land in six states (West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra, Bihar and Chhattisgarh) with the bulk of the property (322.930 acres) located in West Bengal . The minister’s reply, however, has no mention about the status of the land use. According to Jena’s reply, the Jagannath temple has 17 acres in Andhra Pradesh, 28 acres in Maharashtra, 25 acres in Madhya Pradesh, 1.7 acres in Chhattisgarh and 0.274 acre in Bihar.

On November 4, 2019, the Supreme Court had sought information from the temple administration on the immovable property and quarries owned by the deities in Odisha and other states. The temple body had sought more time from the apex court to furnish the details.

Temple sources said land sharks in connivance with some corrupt temple officers had created forged documents and transferred hundreds of acres of land in their names in the state.

NEW DELHI: Amid thick plumes of smoke and shops being ransacked, people trapped in Karawal Nagar frantically started making distress calls on Tuesday. Those living in the internal parts of Karawal Nagar and Khajuri Khas had no escape route with the main road being “captured” by rioters and stone-pelters.

Vikram Pandey, a resident of Karawal Nagar, said, “A mob was outside my house and even policemen weren’t allowed entry. We were stuck at home for two days. I could hear firing. I gave first aid to a man who was hurt in stone-pelting.”

In fact, a family of four had packed its bags to leave for its hometown of Patna. “I don’t think the situation is going to change. I’m not going to put myself or my family in harm’s way. I have applied for leave and I’d rather give my resignation than remain here,” said the family head.

The situation was the same at Bhajanpura with locals standing outside protecting their shops. Delhi Police fired tear gas at the mob in Chand Bagh, which has been on the boil for the last two days.

A woman at Bhajanpura was seen carrying a stick to “simply protect herself and her family”. “Many of us are trapped here. We have to protect ourselves when we go out. Those who are not part of the riots have the most to lose,” she said, while calling police for help.

At Chand Bagh and Yamuna Vihar, the situation was worse. A convoy of at least 25 police vehicles reached Karawal Nagar at 3.40pm. The mob there kept hitting the ground with sticks while sloganeering. Within the next 15 minutes, the mob was contained and the protesters started running towards the narrow lanes of 3-Foota Road. A loud cheer of “Delhi Police Zindabad” was soon heard.

A flag march was conducted at Chand Bagh around 4.15pm. The condition seemed to get normal there, but as soon as security forces passed the mob went berserk. The protesters broke the barriers and pelted stones towards the other side of the road.

Nagma, a resident of Chand Bagh, couldn’t sleep through the night as her son hadn’t returned home. “I had told him to get some items from a shop nearby on Monday. Later, I heard about the clashes. People kept pelting stones in the lane and didn’t let anyone enter. I was awake the entire night worried for his safety. If I had stepped out, then I could have been hurt or killed. I breathed a sigh of relief when he returned in the morning,” she added.

The anger against media personnel was quite evident as the crowd started throwing stones at the journalists. The situation remained tense till late at night, but there was no letup in police cover.

NASHIK/HYDERABAD: A jeweller from Nashik ended his life by jumping to death from the fourth floor of a government guesthouse where he was being questioned by Cyberabad police in relation to purchase of stolen gold on Tuesday.

A team of Cyberabad police along with their counterparts from Mahbubnagar of Telanagana and Guntur of Andhra Pradesh, went to Nashik on Monday to question jeweller, Vijay Birare, about allegedly purchasing stolen gold from a burglar Santosh alias Prakash Shinde Shinde.

Cyberabad police launched a man hunt for Shinde and Shamshabad police arrested him on 15, February after they found his finger prints at a crime scene.

“Shinde was involved in burglaries since late 1990s and was imprisoned also. However Shinde managed to procure a bogus death certificate to close all his pending cases in different cities,” a police official from Nashik said.

Cyberabad commissioner VC Sajjanar said that Shinde is an accused in 24 night burglary cases registered in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

“After his arrest, Shinde confessed that he disposed over two kilos of stolen gold with Vijay Birare and our team went to Nashik with Shinde to recover the stolen property from Vijay. When he was being questioned at a government guest house in Nashik, Vijay made an excuse saying that he had to drink water and committed suicide by jumping from the building,” Cyberabad commissioner said.

While the Cyberabad police told their Nashik counterparts that the jeweller ended his life, his family members accused that police excesses led to his death.

“We apprehend that the victim could have managed to give the Cyberabad police team a slip at the guest house and jumped from the fourth floor to end his life,” said Nashik police sources.

The bereaved family and relatives of the jeweller created a ruckus at Nashik Civil Hospital refusing the authorities to carry out the autopsy. They demanded that Cyberabad police should be booked for Vijay Birare’s death.

Nashik police commissioner, Vishwas Nangare Patil met the bereaved family and assured them of a fair probe into the death.

“The case has been handed over to the state Crime Investigation Department for investigation as victim had died under Cyberabad police detention,” the Nashik city police commissioner told TOI.

NASHIK: The Nashik Rural police on Tuesday conducted a meeting with petrol pump dealers across the rural district to sensitise them about the illegal selling of petrol and diesel in loose on the backdrop of the recent incident in Lasalgaon where the woman accidentally caught fire and died.

Over 100 petrol pump dealers across the rural district were present for the meeting, where the superintendent of police Arti Singh warned the dealers of strict action if they are found selling petrol or fuel in bottles.

There are over 350 petrol pumps across the rural district. While it is legally not allowed to sell the petrol in loose, these rules are often neglected by a large number of petrol pumps.

A good section of motorists is in the habit of carrying additional petrol in bottles or cans so that when their vehicle runs out of petrol, they have the fuel in reserve in the bottle or can. According to police officials, petrol cannot be sold in bottles given the hazards involved while handling highly inflammable fuel.

A few days back, a woman carrying a petrol-filled bottle had an altercation with her paramour and threatened to kill herself by dousing petrol all over her body. The woman accidentally caught fire and got killed.

NEW DELHI: Almost two years after it stayed further construction, Delhi high court on Tuesday gave its nod to the Nauroji Nagar redevelopment project in south Delhi.

The project envisages a commercial hub including a World Trade Centre and was challenged by activists for lacking crucial clearances.

A bench of justices G S Sistani and Jyoti Singh, in its decision, lifted the August 30, 2018 stay by which National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) was restrained from any further construction at the project.

The court held that once the issues of water and traffic congestion have been dealt with and no objection certificates (NOCs) procured from departments concerned, it need not enforce the stay on completion of the redevelopment projects.

Earlier, the court had questioned the Centre on how a residential area could be converted into a commercial zone without change of land use. However, NBCC had maintained that the project was approved as a package by the government and had all clearances from relevant agencies.

“There is no violation of Delhi Preservation of Trees Act and there is adequate compensatory plantation in lieu of felling of trees at Nauroji Nagar,” the bench added, disposing of the petition filed by one Kaushal Kant Mishra, where he had challenged the environment clearance granted to Nauroji Nagar project claiming a large number of trees had to be cut.

“We have no hesitation in saying that the NOCs have been issued by the respective departments and they would have been issued only after a careful analysis of ground realities and provisions of law,” the bench further noted, while relying on an affidavit filed by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) that revealed final sanctions are still awaited from the authorities.

“While we see no violation of the Master Plan Delhi (MPD)-2021 and are also of the view that the environmental clearances (EC) have been correctly given for the Nauroji Nagar project, however, since the NDMC is still seized of the matter, we may only observe that while granting the final sanction, the concerns of the petitioner may be taken into account,” the bench said while disposing of the petition.

It clarified that in case the NDMC is of the opinion it needs to revisit any of the issues flagged by the petitioner in his plea, especially those relating to the grant of ECs, the civic body is free to seek clarifications or reports from the authorities.

223,['26/02/2020'],Morbi relieved after GCC holds back duty,"This story is from February 26, 2020

RAJKOT: In a big respite to Morbi ceramic makers , the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the political and economic union of six Gulf countries, has put in abeyance its interim order to impose anti-dumping duty on tiles imported from India.

GCC had proposed duty ranging between 40% and 106%. The final order was expected a month after the interim order was passed, which was during Diwali last year.

According to the sources, GCC may be reluctant to impose the duty on Indian tiles immediately due as ceramic production in China, the biggest exporter, has come to standstill due to the deadly coronavirus epidemic.

GCC consists of members from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and United Arab Emirates (UAE). The countries had reduced its orders beginning August last year fearing the anti-dumping duty.

Talking to TOI, Nilesh Jetparia president of Morbi’s Ceramic Association said, “We expected GCC’s final order a month ago. But we are getting good orders from Saudi Arabia currently. It’s possible that the local government is not in position to take a final decision because of coronavirus crisis in China.”

Echoing Jetparia’s view, sources in Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) said, “Currently, there is no movement in GCC regarding the anti-dumping duty on Indian tiles. It seems it has been put in abeyance for now.”

According to the data, the export of tiles from Mundra port to the Saudi Arabia was Rs 161 crore in April 2019, which increased to Rs 329 crore in December and Rs 274 crore in January 2020.

Saudi Arabia was the biggest importer of Morbi’s ceramic products during the current financial year. The export is also increased in USA and Europe countries.

“The export orders increased by nearly 10% in the last one month. We are getting benefits in those countries who were importing tiles from India and China,” Jetparia added.

According to reports, Shandong province of China is the biggest ceramic production hub, but manufacturing has not resumed because of the epidemic. It is learnt that labourers have not turned up at the factories and there is lack of logistic and transportation for ceramic products. Sources in ceramic industry said Shandong is not in the position to restart normal production before the end of March.

The Foshan International Ceramic and Bathroom Fair (CeramBath) which was scheduled to be organized from April 18-21 in Gangdong province has also bee postponed.

NEW DELHI: Eight people injured in the riots in northeast Delhi on Tuesday were rushed to Lok Nayak Hospital. Among the injured were four security personnel, who were attacked with acid while they were controlling a mob in Karawal Nagar.

The security personnel suffered burns in the eye and face.

According to hospital sources, the victims of acid attack were aged between 24 years and 37 years. While one of the security personnel, who suffered acid burn in his eye, was referred to Guru Nanak Eye Centre, another acid injury victim was referred to the ENT department of the hospital.

Two others were referred to the burns department for further examination of the injury and treatment.

Coimbatore: The highways department on Tuesday assured the commuters on Mettupalayam Road to restore the width of road after the construction of flyovers at Kavundampalayam and GN Mills. The officials said the flyover pillars would occupy only 2m of the 23m-22m wide road.

It would now take at least 15-18 minutes to cross the Sanganoor Canal-Vellakinar Pirivu stretch, where flyover construction is taking place, during peak hours. Kirubashankar, a resident of Periyanaickenpalayam, said, “The stretch, which is hardly 5km long, is nightmarish between 5pm and 7.30pm and again from 9am to 10.30pm. The road has become too narrow in Kavundampalayam Junction area and hardly a car and a two-wheeler could drive side by side.”

T Shankar, a driver, said the road was not only too narrow but also bumpy with potholes.

The highways department told TOI that the situation would improve once the flyover work was over. An official said the flyovers would occupy only 2m of road space at the centre, leaving 20m of the 22m to 23m wide road for vehicles.

Selvakumar, divisional engineer, national highways, said “It will be like the Gandhipuram flyovers, where cars can drive beneath them comfortably. With the flyover carrying a sizeable portion of the traffic, the road below can accommodate its traffic.”

A section of residents and activists in the area said the service road on either side of the upcoming flyover could be extended by at least 15ft. Mariappan, a resident of Kavundampalayam, said, “This will be beneficial. Even now it plays a major role in easing traffic congestion to a large extent. However, the space is being encroached by some shops.”

230,['26/02/2020'],HC directs state to grant pension to centenarian who worked as Tamil pandit,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Madurai: Directing the state government to disburse pension to a centenarian who worked as a Tamil pandit in various government aided schools, the Madras high court has observed that the authorities concerned should bear in mind that he could enjoy the fruits of this order in his lifetime only based on their swift action in letter and spirit.

The petitioner, K Srinivasan was working between 1944 and 1964 for which he was paid salary by the government. Due to the abolition of the Tamil pandit post, he was relieved from service on December 31, 1964. Since the petitioner was eligible for pension he submitted several representations to the authorities concerned, but no steps were taken.

In 2012, Srinivasan moved the high court Madurai bench, which directed the authorities to pass orders in this regard within eight weeks. However, the director of elementary education passed an order on June 1, 2015, rejecting the petitioner’s claim of pension on the ground that the documents relating to his service was not available.

Hence, he moved the high court Madurai bench in 2015, seeking to quash the rejection order and sought to grant relaxation for not having the relieving order and disburse pension for his service for 15 years two months and three days.

R Subramanian, counsel for the petitioner submitted that an aided school at Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar district in which the petitioner worked lastly had certified that when the petitioner was relieved from service, he was receiving Rs 90 as pay, Rs 25.50 as dearness allowance from the government and Rs 5 as house rent allowance from the management. He stated that the authorities had erroneously rejected the petitioner’s claim.

The special government pleader N Shanmugaselvan submitted that an employee who is retired on attaining the age of superannuation or voluntarily are alone entitled for pension. He further submitted that the petitioner has not produced any documents to show the reason for which he was relieved from service and no document had been produced for his service particulars.

On perusal of the submissions, justice J Nisha Banu observed that the authorities concerned were not able to produce any documents to show that the petitioner was not paid salary by the government and there was no such abolition of posts of Tamil pandit during the relevant point of time. The judge noted that on contrary, the petitioner has produced an appointment order by the then Ramanathapuram district collector and had also produced certificates issued by the schools where he worked.

The judge the set aside the rejection order and directed the state to release pension to the petitioner by considering his case sympathetically and based on the documents produced by him.

231,['26/02/2020'],Farming practices in 4 blocks to be surveyed,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Coimbatore: The district’s agriculture technology management agency (ATMA) plans to survey four blocks—Pollachi, Karamadai, Annur and Periyanaickenpalayam, to understand the exact requirement of farmers and ensure their land and resources are optimally used.

The project to improve their livelihoods and revenue will be a five-year plan. Farmers will be advised on more suitable crops, cultivation practices, varieties and use of machines.

ATMA was launched by the Centre to achieve sustainable agriculture development. It plans to select specific areas, or a few villages, study their soil type, weather, rainfall pattern, labour availability among others and use this data to understand the gap in yield that farmers experience.

The areas selected for the study are Pollachi—which is primarily a coconut-based cropping system, Karamadai which like Thondamuthur is a vegetable cultivation belt, Annur which like Sulthanpet and S Kulam is a millet cultivation belt and Periyanaickenpalayam which is an integrated farming belt, said Tom P Silus, the deputy director in charge of central government schemes, agriculture department.

From mid-March till April-end, ATMA workers will be visiting the four villages and going door to door covering almost every farmer and getting them to fill four surveys. “The four surveys will basically assess the crops they cultivate, variety they cultivate, their water resources like tanks, bores etc., irrigation method, availability of labour, cost of labour, revenue, fertilizers being used, among others. With this, we will identify what they lack and what they need and try providing it for them, and advising them on better options like alternate crops, better varieties available or advising them to add a few milch cows etc.,” Sylus said.

ATMA consists of seven government agencies, including agriculture department, horticulture department, agriculture marketing and business department, agriculture business department, sericulture department, fisheries department and animal husbandry. “We believe that the data we get from these four villages, will be adequate for us to come up with a plan for the entire district, because all four villages have not only different cropping patterns but rainfall and water availability patterns too,” Sylus said.

ATMA conducted a two-day orientation workshop including a few model farmers and panchayat presidents from the four blocks, to draft questions for the survey at TNAU on Monday and Tuesday. “Our plan is to get at least 100 farmers from each block to participate in our survey,” Sylus said.

On Tuesday, some of them breathed their last, raising the death toll to 13.Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital was swamped with relatives of the deceased. Among them were the inconsolable family members of Shahid Khan (22), who came in the line of fire while returning home along with his brother after offering prayers.While his brother managed to dodge the bullets, Khan collapsed in a pool of blood after being shot. He and his wife were planning to go on vacation next month. They had got married in September last year.“His wife is three months pregnant. Their future plans died along with him,” said Khan’s grieving elder brother, Imran.When Khan didn’t return on the fateful day, the family members started to panic. When they heard a knock on the door, they thought he had finally reached. “But it was a stranger who showed us a picture of Shahid lying in a pool of blood in Bhajanpura. We were told that two men had taken him to GTB Hospital. We rushed there and found him dead,” Imran said. Khan was the youngest of four brothers.Like Khan, 32-year-old Furqan was shot dead when he ventured out to buy food. Mohammad Imran, his elder brother, said that Furqan, who had a handicraft business, wanted to buy essential food items to store in the house. Mohammed said the street was relatively clear when he went outside. He had only walked a few hundred metres when a stray bullet hit him.“I was at work when a relative called me saying that Furqan had been shot. I rushed home and we took him to the hospital. He was bleeding profusely and succumbed to his injuries,” said Mohammed.Furqan got married in 2014 and had two children, a four-year-old girl and a two-year-old boy.

Though things were tense in the area, we never expected this to happen,” he added. The autopsy was carried out at GTB Hospital.Another victim, Rahul Solanki (26), a civil engineer by profession, was at home till 5pm. He had assured his colleagues at 4.30pm that all was well and he would meet them the next day.

The bus was to start its trip on the Katraj-Lohegaon route when the incident occurred.“The driver had parked the bus at the main bus stand in Katraj at 6.30pm. However, he did not apply the hand brake. When he was reporting to the controller at the bus stop as per the norm, the vehicle started rolling down a slope. The vehicle belongs to a private contractor and the driver was not directly employed with the PMPML,” a PMPML official said.He said as the bus started rolling down the slope, it gathered speed and hit two autorickshaws, injuring one auto driver, who was later identified as Javed Belge (29) of Katraj.“The bus did not have any passengers. Once it slowed down, a middle-aged man, ran towards the bus and somehow managed to get inside it before applying the brakes, bringing the vehicle to a halt. It is a minor incident and further investigations are on. The Bhartiya Vidyapeeth police are also investigating and a first information report (FIR) has been lodged against the driver,” the official added.When contacted, a PMPML spokesperson said, “An inquiry is still going on. Things will be clear by Wednesday.”Acting on the complaint lodged by the injured, Belge, the Bharati Vidyapeeth police booked the PMPML bus driver on the charge of neglecting safety of road users by keeping his bus engine on at the busy Katraj Chowk.Inspector Vishnu Tamhane of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police said the driver should have switched off the engine before leaving the bus cabin. “He also didn’t apply the hand brakes,” he said.The PMPML official terming the incident “minor” drew flak from commuters and activists alike.“How can this (incident) be termed minor? If the man not reacted on time, the bus could have hit more vehicles and people on the road. How can the PMPML be so casual about it? This again exposes the PMPML and shows that things are far from fine in the transport utility. This incident, like many others, would deter new commuters from using the service,” PMP Pravasi Manch activist Sanjay Shitole said.Questioning the “casual approach” of the PMPML, he said, “Have they (PMPML authorities) still not understood that all buses, whether owned by PMPML or private contractors, run under as PMPML vehicles?”Akshay Datre, a commuter, said, “This is so scary. If the bus had passengers, they would have panicked, leading to a major accident. The casual approach of the PMPML should end at once.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74314278,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-782672,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/one-injured-as-parked-pmpml-bus-rolls-down-slope-in-katraj/articleshow/74309060.cms

DEHRADUN: The 28-year-old son of former transport commissioner of Haryana shot dead his mother before killing himself in Sahaspur area of Dehradun on Tuesday morning.

Jai Pandit, son of late Subhash Sharma who was the former transport commissioner of Haryana, shot dead his 70-year-old mother, identified as Sushila Devi, inside his residence before committing suicide .

According to police , Jai, believed to be a drug addict, was running a dairy and a students' hostel at his farmhouse in Bhauwala area of Sahaspur, on the outskirts of Dehradun.

“Around 8.30am on Tuesday, Jai asked his servant to go out of the house saying that he wanted to talk to his mother. Within minutes, according to the eyewitnesses, sounds of multiple gunshots were heard. On entering the room, the servant saw both son and mother lying in a pool of blood,” said inspector Rajiv Rauthan, in charge of Sahaspur police station.

Jai, who originally hailed from Rewari district of Haryana, was supposed to take his mother to Chandigarh on Tuesday to check the issue of non-disbursement of family pension for the past four months. He had even booked a taxi for Chandigarh, police said.

One of his friends, identified as Ankit Srivastav, who had come from Varanasi and was staying on the first floor of the house, was also supposed to accompany the mother-son duo to Chandigarh.

Jai’s father had retired from service in 2009, after which he made a farmhouse in Bhauwala area of Dehradun. He died in 2012 and since then his son has been looking after the property.

Rauthan added, “The neighbours told police that Jai was addicted to drugs and had an erratic behaviour. Preliminary investigation didn’t point towards any property or family feud.”

NEW DELHI: Journalists are being attacked by both sides involved in the Citizenship Amendment Act-related violence in northeast Delhi, with six of them roughed up on Tuesday at the riot sites. Akash Napa, a correspondent for JK24*7 news channel, was shot while reporting from Maujpur in the afternoon and had to be admitted to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, where, according to the latest medical report, his condition was serious.

Three NDTV reporters and cameraperson were beaten by the mob. In the assault, Arvind Gunasekar lost three teeth. Saurabh Shukla was hit on his back with lathis when he intervened to save Gunasekar. At a separate location, Mariyam Alvi was hit on her back. NDTV claimed there were no police personnel present in the areas where its journalists were attacked.

Parvina Purkayastha, a reporter for Times Now, tweeted about being cornered by a group armed with sticks and bricks. “I pleaded with them and ran for my life,” she said on Twitter. The mobile phone of another Times Now journalist was snatched and reformatted. Incidents of phones of journalists filming arson and violence being grabbed and broken are becoming common now.

On Monday, TOI reported on how two of its journalists were heckled by rioters in Maujpur-Jafrabad while a photojournalist was even threatened with the removal of his trousers to ascertain his religion.

Both Press Club of India and Indian Women’s Press Corps expressed serious concern at journalists coming under attack in northeast Delhi since Sunday. The statement issued by the journalists’ bodies reads: “Several journalists have been hospitalised. They have been punched and attacked by communal mobs, and police were either absent or did not come to help. Shockingly, the mobs were checking the religious credentials of journalists.”

The statement of the two bodies said, “We have little doubt the attackers actively sought to prevent videography or photography that may lead to them being identified.” Condemning both police and politicians, the statement added, “A lethargic police and politicians instigating communal violence cannot escape blame for the attacks on the media… We expect the authorities, particularly police and the Union home ministry, to be alive to democratic sensibilities and ensure that the media are not brought under physical assault.”

Coimbatore: Making it clear that unrecognised schools will be dealt with legally, if they did not get approvals, chief education officer (CEO) P Usha, who took charge last week, said the district school education department will be strict in dealing with them.

The CEO said the department has already sent two show-cause notices to unrecognised schools. “We are in the process of sending the third show-cause notices.

The schools have been clearly told that they have to get necessary approvals or else have to face legal action. If they don’t comply, as per the directions of the district collector, we will proceed with action,” she said, adding that schools should submit their proposal documents within this month and should get approvals within May.

To help parents who want to join their wards in schools, the department will come up with the list of recognised schools before the upcoming academic year in June. “We will prepare the final list of recognised schools and publicise it,” she said.

According to data released by the school education department in July 2019, 205 private play schools and 40 private nursery and primary schools in the district were functioning without recognition.

Block education officers have been inspecting the schools and serving them with show-cause notices.

Nearly 300 women shifted to Seelampur, a kilometre away from Jafrabad metro station (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The stretch below Jafrabad Metro Station, which was occupied by women protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act, was vacated around 7.30pm on Tuesday. As surrounding areas went up in flames and mobs unleashed fury on common people just a few hundred metres away, a call for clearing the place went out.

“Local leaders, clerics and activists appealed to us to move for our own safety. A similar call was made from the mosque before the evening prayer in the neighbourhood,” said one of the protesters. Police, too, asked the people to vacate the site.

The dialogue between the community elders and the women concluded around 7pm with everyone reaching a consensus that it was “in the interest of the movement” to shift to another site. “The movement against CAA/NRC/NPR will continue. But we have to send the message across that this is not a communal issue. Therefore, for larger good, we have decided to move,” said Sania.

Nearly 300 women shifted to Seelampur , a kilometre away from Jafrabad metro station, and joined the sit-in there. By 8.30pm, several men from the neighbourhood joined to ensure nothing went amiss.

One of the volunteers, Amir, told TOI that the issue was to ensure people’s safety as they navigated between the two sites. “There was violence everywhere. Teargas shells were being fired. Some volunteers were seriously injured. To ensure women reach the other site safely was a challenge,” he said.

Amidst smoke-filled air, stones and glass shards littered on the road, the volunteers, forming human chains around the women, managed to cover the distance between the two sites.

“The area leading to Maujpur has to be monitored constantly to ensure no anti-social elements attack women. This night will be very long,” said Sania, assuring that the spirit of the movement will prevail.

At Shaheen Bagh, which became the inspiration behind the Jafrabad protest site, things were calm. The protesters in the neighbourhood said they heard that the women at Jafrabad were asked to “leave” and condemned the violence. “Our protests have been peaceful and so has theirs,” one of the women told TOI.

Madurai: The state government has been directed to look into the issue of establishing homes for destitute women and victims of heinous crimes above 18 years.

Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana of the Madras high court passed the order while allowing the pregnancy termination of a 17-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted in Tuticorin district.

Observing that there is no rehabilitation home for women above the age of 18 years in the state, the judge directed the secretary of the social welfare department to formulate policies in consultation with the other secretaries concerned, to address this issue within a period of eight weeks.

Since the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which seeks to extend the termination of pregnancy period from 20 to 24 weeks is pending before the Parliament for approval, the judge reiterated that there should be a permanent committee constituted for setting up a protocol procedure or permanent mechanism for expediting the termination of pregnancy involving rape victims and abnormal foetus. The judge also directed the principal secretary of the health and family welfare department to look in this issue and take appropriate action.

“Even though the victim is a minor under the care and protection of her mother, this kind of unfortunate event happened. Therefore, there is no guarantee that even after this medical termination of pregnancy is performed, she will get relieved of such kind of risk in the future,” observed the judge.

Hence, the judge observed that the minor girl is admitted in a home and the mother and the family are suffering in penury and hence, post-natal care is to be extended to this girl. The judge directed the Tuticorin principal district judge to follow up the matter right till the complete recovery of the girl. The judge further directed the principal district judge to submit a report to this court once in two weeks in this regard and adjourned the case to the first week of March.

The judge allowed the pregnancy termination of the girl after taking note of the report submitted by the team of medical experts. The judge also directed to preserve the DNA of the foetus for criminal trial and further directed the police to expedite the process of criminal trial at the earliest as the victim’s mother who moved court is awaiting compensation.

Vadodara: She may not have seen Prime Minister Narendra Modi or US President Donald Trump or even the mammoth gathering for the ‘Namaste Trump’ event at Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad, but what she experienced at the event will be memories for life for this 14-year-old blind girl from Godhra.

Happy Desai sang the famous song ‘Teri laadki main’ with celebrated folk music icon Kirtidan Gadhavi on the stage at the Namaste Trump event ahead of the arrival of Modi and Trump at the stadium. Happy was roped in for the performance only on Saturday.

Happy, who is blind from birth, had started learning music as a five-year-old. She sang at a major event for the first time earlier this year at the Panchmahotsav in Pavagadh here she performed with Parthiv Gohil where she had rendered ‘Teri laadki main’.

Happy’s father Vinod Kumar said that he got a call in the early hours on Saturday asking him if his daughter would perform at Motera Stadium. “I agreed and at around 8.30am, I was asked to reach Ahmedabad by 3pm on Saturday itself,” said Vinod who is a teacher at a government primary school. He added that a rehearsal took place on the same day in the night.

The girl said that she did feel nervous while performing at the event. “I could feel the crowd. I had never expected to sing at such an event. It seemed as if I was having a dream,” said Happy.

Seeing her interest in music, her father is planning to support her and encourage her. “I wish she does a PhD in vocal music,” he said.

Vadodara: The district primary education officer (DPEO) of Chhota Udepur has come under fire after a surprise visit by primary and secondary education secretary Dr Vinod Rao on Monday.

During Rao’s visit it came to light that DPEO B D Bariya was reportedly absent without taking prior permission of senior officers and also ignorant of Rao’s instructions. Rao had also visited schools and went through books during which he reportedly learned that as a class I supervising and monitoring officer, Bariya was completely negligent.

Due to Bariya’s lethargic work, the education department served him a show-cause notice on Monday evening asking him to respond within three days about why action should not be initiated against him.

The show-cause notice also mentioned that the education department has taken several initiatives in the past one year to bring changes in quality of primary and secondary education in the state.

However, during Rao’s visit, it came to light that Bariya was unaware of any of these initiatives, sources said.

Chhota Udepur district has consistently remained at the bottom in performance during class X and class XII examinations in the past few years.

DEHRADUN/NAINITAL: Angry at the Char Dham Devsthanam Management Act that the state assembly recently passed and which gives control of around 50 temples including the four Char Dham shrines to the Uttarakhand government , priests of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri have warned pilgrims not to visit the holy sites as they “might witness something worse than the 2013 tragedy”. Seven years ago, massive floods had ravaged the hill state.

The priests' warning came during the annual practice of Char Dham priests travelling across the country to visit devotees when portals of the temples are closed during winter.

The priests have alleged that the state government is playing with people’s faith. On Tuesday, Shiv Prakash, chief priest (rawal) of the Gangotri temple in Uttarkashi, told TOI, “By taking over the temples through this law, the state government is playing with religion and people’s faith. If they don’t quash the law, something worse than the 2013 floods will happen.” He has already visited Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Delhi to persuade people to not visit Char Dham shrines this year in protest against the shrine board law. He will be travelling to Assam next.

Rajesh Semwal, another priest from the Gangotri shrine, told TOI that if the state government doesn’t retract the law, the priests will boycott temple rituals this year and pilgrims won’t be able to offer prayers. “If the priests boycott rituals, the yatra of pilgrims will remain incomplete,” he said, adding that the government’s move doesn’t send a positive message to pilgrims.

This came even as senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy moved the Uttarakhand high court on Tuesday against the newly passed Act. Following this, the HC has given the state government three weeks’ time to respond to Swamy’s PIL.

“The division bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma heard arguments from both sides and directed the government to file their responses within three weeks,” Swamy said. He also demanded that the court put a stay on the Act.

Lawyers appearing for the government, including advocate general SN Babulkar and chief standing counsel Paresh Tripathi, have defended the Act and said it has been passed following the country’s Constitution and that the petition is based on a ""political stunt"" and therefore should be quashed.

The Char Dham Yatra this year will start from the last week of April with the portals of Gangotri and Yamunotri opening on April 26, followed by those of Kedarnath and Badrinath subsequently.

249,['26/02/2020'],‘Renewed’ status for only 9 out of 65 leased Cantonment properties,"This story is from February 26, 2020

PUNE: The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) continues to grapple with the renewal of long-term lease of properties under its jurisdiction two months after the lapse of the December 2019 deadline set by the ministry of defence (MoD).

As of now, barely nine of the total 65 leased properties in the PCB limits, for which renewal proposals were under process, have got their renewals.

“Of the remaining 56, five lease holders neither applied for lease renewal nor did they respond to our correspondence. We have since recommended to the Principal Director of Defence Estates (PDDE) for termination of their lease,” said Amit Kumar , the PCB’s chief executive officer.

The proposals of 51 properties are pending at various stages. Kumar said, “Almost 90% of the leased properties are residential in nature. The rest are either commercial or residential-cum-commercial units.”

The lease holder normally applies to the PCB for (lease) renewal at the end of the earlier (lease) term. The PCB does an on-site verification of the property, including instances of any violation of the lease terms and conditions, and prepares a report with its recommendation.

The report is then sent to the office of the PDDE, which has certain powers to act on the PCB’s recommendations. In cases where the matter is beyond its power, it is referred to the Director General of Defence Estate and the MoD in Delhi. Action is taken as per the MoD’s final word.

Kumar said, “The lease renewal is a time-consuming process and this should explain why we have got nine renewal proposals sanctioned so far. We will wait for the MoD’s further directives on the issue. In cases where there is clear recommendation from the higher authorities and as per the procedure, we will send legal notices to the lease holders seeking their explanation for not having a valid lease agreement.”

He said, “If someone misuses a leased property, like using a residential unit for commercial purpose, the board is authorized to take legal action against such person under the Cantonment Act, 2006.”

A property owner said requesting anonymity, “Despite submitting relevant documents, the authorities take months to complete the procedure. We had to wait for two years to get the renewal for the property.”

A senior Director General Defence Estates (DGDE) official in New Delhi told TOI over the phone that over 40 cantonments across the country have not finished their lease renewal process within the deadline. “Considering the situation, the MoD may extend the deadline once again,” he said.

Another senior DGDE official said, “The MoD has delegated administrative power to the PDDE and, hence, many of the cases have been processed and renewed across the cantonments.”

Traders clashed with police on the first day of the protest in Rajkot

RAJKOT: The ongoing traders’ strike of Rajkot market yard entered the 9th day on Tuesday without any solution emerging to end the stalemate between the traders and the police.

Meanwhile, after the directors failed to solve the impasse, a board meeting of the market yard was called on Tuesday where the traders, commission agents and the directors met to resolve the ongoing issue. The meet decided to suspend licenses of traders and commission agents if the strike isn’t called off within three days.

The BJP-ruled market yard board has come under the pressure from both farmers ’ body as well as the state government to end the strike at the earliest.

The traders and commission agents of the market yard went on strike over the issue of mosquito menace, demanding a permanent solution to the age-old problem. The mosquito breeding is rampant in the backside of the market as the city’s sewage gets accumulated in the Aji riverbed.

On Tuesday, the farmers too protested at the market yard demanding resumption of auction. When contacted, the president of commission agents, Atul Kamani said, “We are also exploring options to challenge the order in the high court if the authorities suspend our licenses.”

Protesting traders last week clashed with the police who detained the traders and also booked 32 other people along with traders, a few farmers, and labourers on charges of rioting. Looking at the grievousness of the matter, the chief minister’s office has issued order to immediately solve the problem.

According to rough estimate the daily turn over of the yard is Rs 7-8 crore. Rajkot market yard is Saurashtra ’s biggest market yard. The traders are demanding chief minister’s intervention to solve this stalemate.

Talking to TOI, chairman of Rajkot market yard, D K Sakhia said, “We cannot allow them to take the market yard into their hands. The farmers are facing massive trouble for the past nine days. We have decided to suspend licenses if the strike isn’t called off within three days.”

Coimbatore: In the backdrop of violence and arson over CAA protests in New Delhi, top police officials of the city met with representatives of Coimbatore’s Shaheen Bagh at Aathupalam Junction and asked them to conduct the sit-in without causing inconvenience to traffic and the public and cooperate with police for safety and security reasons.

Representatives assured police officials that such incidents would not happen in the city. K Raja Hussain, district president of Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and the organiser of the federation of all Jamaaths and Muslim organisations, said people of all faiths are living in harmony in the city. “People from other faiths are also taking part in the protest,” he said.

The sit-in against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Registry of Citizens (NRC) and the National People’s register (NPR) entered seventh day on Tuesday.

Protesters said they were careful to conduct the protest peacefully and not allow even a small untoward incident to take place till CAA is repealed. Meanwhile, central committee member of CPM U Vasuki addressed the protesters.

Many of the protesters were working and businesspeople. They have given up their pay and have been taking part in what many of them term the ‘second struggle for Indian Independence’.

Ibrahim, an organiser at the protest site, said he had two readymade garment retail outlets in the city and had not visited them in seven days. “I went to the shops for half an hour to see accounts. I would head back to the protest site soon.”

Considering security reasons, women protesters are sent home at night and they come back to the protest site after they finish their household chores and sending their children to schools and colleges in the morning. Shameema Habeeb, a protester, said women were ready to sit in protest in night. “But considering security, we come home. We are strong in our idea that we would not allow even a small untoward incident to happen,” she said.

There were also views among protesters that the sit-in was getting monotonous and they were looking to engage in other forms of civil protests. Mujibur Rahman, an organiser, said they would not let go the Shaheen Bagh protest, but simultaneously look for other means of protests too.

Many workers have left the area as the riots have left behind a trail of destruction in northeast Delhi

NEW DELHI: With northeast Delhi in the grip of violence for close to three days, local residents are a worried lot.

The area is a hub of migrant labourers who have come to the capital to earn a livelihood from Bihar and various parts of Uttar Pradesh and mostly work in local factories.

Around Seelampur, eight of them were waiting on a footpath for stone-pelting to stop. Most of them were even scared to talk, but one of them said, “We work here as artisans. But since Monday night, the roads are on fire. I do not want to die as I am not part of any protest. We have come here to work and earn money. I am now going back to Muzaffarngar.” Another interrupted him, saying his family had called and asked him to return to Moradabad.

In Bhajanpura, the situation is not much different. Raj Kumar, the owner of a liquor shop, said, “People broke my store open and took beer and wine bottles in the wee hours. Over 100 cartons of alcohol worth around Rs 80 lakh are missing. I have informed police.”

A footwear shop was vandalised in Ghonda and the shoes and other items were distributed among rioters. But as the owner rushed in to save whatever was left, the rioters realised that they had mistakenly attacked the shop of a “known” person and asked people to return the looted items.

With the situation remaining tense, many families are moving out of Karawal Nagar for now. A family of four has decided to return to Patna. “I am not going to put myself or my family in harm’s way. I have applied for leave from my office and I’d rather submit my resignation if the situation does not get better,” said one of them.

The man pointed out that hundreds of others were also living in fear. Recalling Monday night, he said they had never experienced anything as scary when they felt they could be attacked any time. “We do not want to live in constant fear. It’s better to be away till the situation normalises.”

Anand, who stays on 66 Foota Road where violence has been going on, was looking for a way to reach a metro station along with two women and three children. With bags on his shoulder, Anand said he was trying to reach a relative’s home in Faridabad.

Visakhapatnam: Tension flared between two groups during a religious procession at Visalakshi Nagar under Arilova police station limits in the city on Tuesday. The tiff reportedly started over the use of loudspeakers by the organisers of the procession near a college in the area, but nearly spiralled into a violent fight before the timely intervention of police brought things under control.

A community elder said a group of youngsters came on bikes and shouted at them to stop the procession and disperse from the locality. “It was a peaceful rally which is held regularly. The group also attacked our woman members,” he alleged.

Dismissing the claims, the other group said they only asked to reduce the volume of the loudspeaker during the rally as it was passing close to a college and classes were on. “When they ignored our plea, we asked them to produce the permission letter from the police for using the loudspeaker. We neither chased nor attacked them, we only asked them to not use loudspeakers,” a member of the other group said.

MVP Colony police station inspector Ch Shanmukha Rao said loudspeakers were being used in the rally without obtaining police permission. “When some youngsters asked the organisers not to use loudspeakers near a college, there was some argument between the two groups. We prevented a possible clash by reaching the spot and pacified both the groups. We also told them to obtain prior permission before holding any rally in future,” Rao said, adding that they didn’t register any case as there were no clashes or attacks as is being claimed by one group.

Coimbatore: A 29-year-old woman from Ondipudur on Tuesday submitted a petition with the superintendent of police office claiming that her husband was charged with a false case and arrested by Andhra Pradesh police about a week ago. She sought the SP’s intervention in releasing her husband from prison.

In her complaint, Vaneeshwari said the Rajahmundry police charged her husband Ravichandran, who is in transport business, with stealing bags of rice that had to be delivered to a customer in Kollam. An FIR was registered against him under sections 407 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and was arrested.

Vaneeshwari said her husband had leased a lorry on November 1 and was transporting goods within the state. “On February 4, the Rajahmundry police called him and questioned him about whereabouts of sacks of rice that went missing within their limit on January 29,” she said, adding, “We did not have a clue. The last trip the lorry had was on January 27. We parked the lorry in front of our house at Ondipudur for the next couple of days and then it was left in a private parking lot.”

The Rajahmundry police visited us on February 11 and told my husband to accompany them to Andhra Pradesh for inquiry purpose and drove away the lorry too, she said. “We submitted toll gate tickets and parking lot tickets to prove that the lorry was in Coimbatore. However, they arrested my husband and lodged him in prison,” she said.

She alleged that police were thrashing her husband to make him admit to the crime that he did not commit. Instead of arresting the culprits who stole the rice using a vehicle with fake registration plate, the police had arrested my husband, she said.

Receiving the petition, police officials assured to look into it.

Madurai: Construction of a permanent structure at Alwarpuram to enable the grand entry of Lord Kallalagar into the river Vaigai during the Chithirai festival, which was taken up recently will be completed in a month’s time, officials from the Madurai Corporation have said.

In the absence of a permanent structure, the corporation used to construct a temporary ramp. The civic body used to shell out more than Rs 40 lakh for construction the ramp alone, officials said.

An official from the engineering wing said the permanent concrete structure taken up under the Smart City scheme is taking shape rapidly. It is a part of the Vaigai River Front development work and construction is expected to be completed by the end of March. The Chithirai festival takes place in April or May, he said.“Unlike the temporary ramp, the proposed structure will have bigger hollow beneath, which will allow water to pass freely. In the past, a boy, who was washed away got stuck in a smaller pipe. The new structure will be safer,” he said.

Corporation commissioner S Visakan visited the construction area and instructed the contractor to finish the work at the earliest.

VADODARA: The goods and services tax (GST) department on Tuesday arrested a businessman for fraudulently availing input tax credit and duping the government of Rs 15 crore.

Manoj Agrawal, who is into scrap business, was nabbed after CGST, Vadodara II commissionerate investigated his firm’s transactions over last few months.

GST officials said that Agrawal had been issuing fake invoices without the actual movement of goods to generate fraudulent input tax credit. “Investigations revealed that the accused had created eight firms located in Vadodara, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore. They were receiving fake invoices from other firms and, in turn, were passing on the input tax credit using their firms,” GST officials said.

“The investigation further revealed that the fake firms utilized the input tax credit in tax payment of goods purchased from registered/unregistered tax payers. Further, to validate the receipt and supply, they had generated e-way bills using seven trucks which were stationed at a single place and had not moved,” GST officials added.

Investigation has so far revealed that the accused issued and received fake invoices to the tune of Rs 100 crore and fraudulently availed input tax credit worth Rs 15 crore.

GST officials said that the accused has been sent to judicial custody. “He (Agarwal) began availing input tax credit fraudulently soon after GST was introduced,” a GST official said.

NEW DELHI: Among the more than 200 victims of stone-pelting and shooting in northeast Delhi is a 13-year-old boy. He was shot in his back. Victims like him include two men who were returning home when they were attacked by a mob. Police also confirmed four acid attack cases.Faizi Hussain, 13, was on his way home from school on Monday when he learnt about riots breaking out in his neighbourhood of Vijay Park near Maujpur. He reached home safely, but the curious youngster ventured out for a look at what was happening. A few minutes later, a bullet fired from somewhere on the main road hit him in his lower back and he collapsed.Doctors have told the family it’s wiser not to remove the bullet lodged in his lower spine — so the boy will have to live with it for the rest of his life. At Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, where Hussain is undergoing treatment, his family recalled how saving the teenager’s proved difficult. “It would have been almost impossible to get him to hospital if our family hadn’t owned an autorickshaw,” Hussain’s father, Munna, said.“We were pelted with stones on the way. He was bleeding profusely. I feared that I was going to lose him,” Munna said. “The doctors have told us the bullet is lodged deep inside near the spinal cord. They said surgery poses a risk to his life.” The father also worries that his son, who is an enthusiastic sports lover, will now be unable to fulfil his wish of becoming a national sportsperson with a bullet lodged in his body for life.On Tuesday evening, hospitals in east and northeast Delhi were taking in more victims. More than 150 people had been admitted to GTB Hospital, around 20 at Jag Pravesh Hospital, 10 in Max Patparganj and 15 in Lok Nayak Hospital.Shah Alam, 45, is one of them. The tailor was hurrying back home in the Mustafabad area, when he saw a group of rioters marching down the road towards him with lathis, stones and other weapons. From behind him, a couple of stones flew in his direction. A jittery Alam took cover against the wall, but a stone hit him on the right side of his neck, opening up a deep gash. Alam, who has since undergone surgery, disclosed that he might have to remain in the hospital for at least a week to recover.Shahir, 25, found himself in a similar situation barely a few hundred metres from where Alam was targeted. “I was returning home from work when I heard gun shots ring out close to me. I was scared and started looking for cover, but before I could find a safe spot, I was shot twice on my upper thigh,” Shahir said. “I fell unconscious and when I regained my senses, I found myself in the hospital. I am so grateful to God that I am alive. In riots like these, what can people like me do? I had nothing to do with the protest yet am facing the brunt of it.”Among those who have been hospitalised with injuries sustained in the mob attacks is Aakash, a journalist was in Maujpur to report on the riots.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74310125,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-319479,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/innocence-lost-teenager-shot-at-on-way-home-from-school-among-scores-injured/articleshow/74309144.cms

CM Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath on Tuesday said none of the communities and religions in India produce terrorists . Those involved in terrorist activities in Kashmir are not Indians, but outsiders, he said.

“Has any regional terrorism been born in India? There is regional terrorism in Holland, in America. We, people of every society and every religion (in India) do not produce terrorists. Those in Kashmir are not Indian terrorists, they are outsiders. We cannot say that terrorists in Kashmir are Indians,” Nath said at the inauguration of a new building of Masajid Committee near Taj-ul-Masajid in Bhopal .

India’s strength is in its multiculturalism and the times call for the elderly to “advise” youngsters, the CM said. “Our country’s culture is brotherhood. For thousands of years, from the times of (Emperor) Chandragupta and Ashoka, what a culture (of peace and unity)! Our civilization is the biggest strength of India. The thought of today’s youth is different. Sometimes, they become excited but it is the responsibility of the elders to provide the right direction and vision to future generations,” said Nath.

The chief minister also praised harmony and unity being propagated by all religions, and said, “Our country, our culture is great because it has the characteristic of being united with a sense of honour and respect for each other. This culture of unity in diversity is intact because people of the old generation were dedicated to protecting it. The biggest challenge before us today is that we should bring the origin, civilization and diversity of our great culture closer to the younger generation and they should imbibe it, so that our country always remains safe and united.”

The CM okayed minority welfare minister Arif Aqueel’s proposal to hike the honorarium of Imams from Rs 2,200 to Rs 5,000 per month and that of their deputies, moijjans, from Rs 1,900 to Rs 4,500 a month. This will benefit 4,534 persons and cost the exchequer Rs 43.52 crore a year, said Aqueel.

Jaipur: The Opposition on Tuesday created ruckus in the House during Question Hour demanding compensation for kin of farmers who died while working in agriculture field.

Minister Shanti Dhariwal, while replying to a question by Madan Dilawar on the number of farmers who died from October 2019 to February 2020 during agriculture work in Kota division and the compensation paid, said the number of farmers died is eight but only five were given compensation of Rs 2 lakh as others died due to non-agriculture reasons like extreme cold.

The minister said the compensation was paid from the Rajiv Gandhi Krushak Sathi Yogana. “As per the provisions of the scheme, only those farmers who had met with some accidents while working in the field were eligible for compensation. Three of the farmers’ families could not be given compensation as one of them died due to biting cold and others have neither conducted post-mortem nor applied for compensation.”

He said if someone dies of cold while working in the field is not accident. The person should have covered well before venturing out to the field. This led to ruckus in the House as the Opposition demanded that compensation be paid to all farmers.

265,['26/02/2020'],VMRDA begins work on ‘realistic’ budget,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) has begun preparing the budget for the 2020-21 fiscal. VMRDA officials are keen on creating a realistic budget in tandem with the urban development authority’s financial position, instead of inflating proposals.

Even though the VMRDA wanted to limit the budget to around Rs 1,100 crore, it was learnt that budgetary proposals would be around Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,300 crore in tune with its priorities.

A major chunk of the expenditure is expected to go towards preparation of the master plan, NAD Flyover project, master plan roads , development of pooled land and the development of Yarada Hills.

Over the last few months, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy laid foundation stones for nearly Rs 380 crore worth of works of the VMRDA. All these works will feature in this year’s budget with allocations worth Rs 200 crore devoted to the works over two fiscals.

Some of these works include: Kailasagiri Hill-top Park development which has been allocated Rs 56.5 crore, planetarium of Kailasagiri Hill-top Park allocated Rs 37 crore, integrated museum allocated Rs 40 crore, multi-level car parking allocated Rs 80 crore, commercial complex at Ram Nagar allocated Rs 13.5 crore, master plan road at APSEZ entrance in Pudimadaka allocated Rs 27.13 crore.

According to a source in VMRDA, final touches are being made right now. “The budget is likely to be ready in the next two weeks,” the source said.

In 2019-20, the VMRDA had pegged its budget at Rs 1,286.5 crore. The budget had earmarked Rs 100 crore for the development of an ‘information technology city’ in Madhurawada. However, the project did not make any headway over the last one year.

Now, VMRDA officials are mulling over how to work on the project by getting rental assurance from IT giants as it involves nearly 20 acres prime land and investment of nearly Rs 100 crore.

Meanwhile, the VMRDA might also drop some projects proposed in the earlier budget like the construction of a cycling and jogging tract from Kailasagiri to Bheemili (allocated Rs 2 crore), Masala Bazaar and Vuda Park (allocated Rs 5 crore). VMRDA is expected to allocate some money to civil and greenery works in Vizianagaram district.

267,['26/02/2020'],CRPF officer moved in to control Delhi riots,"This story is from February 26, 2020

SN Shrivastava was the anti-terror chief in Delhi Police till 2015 (File photo)

NEW DELHI: In a surprise move, the ministry of home affairs on Tuesday evening posted 1985-batch IPS officer SN Shrivastava as the chief of law & order in Delhi. He was serving as special director general in Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).

Shrivastava was repatriated to his parent AGMUT-cadre around noon after which lieutenant governor Anil Baijal posted him as special commissioner (law & order) with clear directives to restore order and security in the capital. Shrivastava is also the senior-most person in line for Delhi Police commissioner.

Known for his integrity and no-nonsense attitude, Shrivastava was the anti-terror chief in Delhi Police till 2015. He was also handling terror operations in Kashmir during his stint in CRPF. Officers who worked with him said he was a hard taskmaster with an eye for detail. He had headed several departments in Delhi Police before being sent on deputation to CRPF.

Sources said Shrivastava assumed charge immediately and took stock of the situation in the capital. He was also reportedly part of a two-hour meeting held by Union home minister Amit Shah late in the evening. In another meeting held around midnight, Shrivastava and other Delhi Police officers chalked out a strategy to bring down violence in the riot-hit areas.

During Shrivastava’s tenure in Delhi Police, Special Cell had wiped out the Indian Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba network from the capital. Brought in the aftermath of the Delhi high court blasts in 2011, he played a crucial role in strengthening Special Cell. While preventing terror attacks for over three years, the cell went on to arrest 37 terrorists, including 22 from IM and 7 from LeT.

“IM’s deputy chief Tehsin Akhtar, Pak bomb-maker Waqas, Abdul Qarim Tunda and IM’s shadow techie Ajaj Shaikh landed behind bars due to his team’s efforts. His team also solved the 2012 Pune serial blasts and the Jama Masjid blast,” said a senior officer.

The post of law & order chief was last held by well-known IPS officer Deepak Mishra. After Mishra, the post was divided into two parts with an objective to achieve better security and order in the capital. However, the move backfired with law and order hitting rock bottom in the last four years during which Delhi Police had two commissioners, Alok Verma and Amulya Patnaik.

PUNE: A jobless man was booked on Monday for attacking a 31-year-old constable outside Kasewadi police chowkey on Sunday night following a dispute over registering the complaint of a handcart operator accusing him of vandalising vehicles at Kasewadi slums.

The constable, Amol Uttam Patekar from the Khadak police, lodged an FIR under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code after he was discharged from the Sassoon General Hospital.

Police said the handcart operator, Imran Shaikh from Kasewadi slums, called the city police control room stating that the suspect had barged into his house, attacked him and vandalised vehicles. After the control room relayed the message to the Kasewadi police chowkey, a police team reached the spot. The police personnel brought Shaikh and the suspect to the chowkey and started questioning them before lodging Shaikh’s FIR.

The suspect picked up a dispute with constable Patekar for questioning him in the presence of his 10-15 supporters. He then abused Patekar and instructed a woman to tear her clothes for teaching the policeman a lesson, police said.

A police officer said, “Patekar called a superior officer and gave the information of the incident, following which he was instructed to escort Shaikh and the suspect to the police station.”

The officer said, “The suspect sat on a policeman’s bike after he was requested to go to the police station, but he later alighted fearing that a case would be registered against him and again abused Patekar. In a fit of anger, he pushed the constable down.”

The other policeman tried to overpower the suspect, but he created ruckus and fled. A police team has been fanned for arresting him, the officer added.

Madurai: The measures taken by the Madurai Corporation to prevent misuse and pilferage of water meant for distribution to residents through vehicles has helped the civic body save around Rs 60 lakh a month. The money can be used for various other public amenities by fund started Madurai corporation.

Last year, the corporation installed global positioning System (GPS) and pressure sensors in all the 34 trucks and 33 tractors used for water supply. GPS tracking helps locate vehicles real time and to ensure they are reaching the assigned locations. Whereas, pressure sensors help officials to check remaining water in each vehicle and to make sure that vehicles reach filling station only after entire water gets emptied. Earlier, trucks make a beeline at the filling station without supplying entire water to show that they have made more trips in a shorter time, thus burning a hole in the corporation’s coffers. GPS has also brought in greater transparency and accountability in water supply as a vehicle cannot be diverted as per whims and fancies of certain influential people. Corporation commissioner S Visakan said, “Earlier corporation spending used to be around Rs 1.5 crore. It has come down to Rs 90 lakh. Apart from curbing water diversion and theft, accountability has also been brought in. Even if a load of water is required for commissioner’s bungalow, I have to make a request to the assistant engineer concerned, who will approve through the system.”

CM Kamal Nath

INDORE: Congress MLA from Chachoda assembly seat Laxman Singh on Tuesday said that chief minister Kamal Nath should decentralise power to get good results in government as well as in the organisation.

“When Digvijaya Singhji was chief minister, he had taken a big decision of decentralisation of power to empower civic bodies, gram panchayats…..and it had yielded good results,” Laxman told mediapersons.

Urging Nath for decentralisation of power, Laxman, who is brother of Digvijaya said, “Kamal Nathji is a good administrator and has years of political experience. He has served in as minister in UPA rule at the Centre and knows how to run a government. He asks MLAs and party workers for problems and tells them that he is capable of resolving them…. But somewhere, you need to decentralize the power.”

Nath is probably waiting for panchayat and civic body elections to get over before taking a step in this regard, he added.

When asked about appointment of MPCC chief Laxman said, “There are many capable party leaders, including women, who can be assigned the post of MPCC chief. But he/she should visit across the state , stay at nights in villages and take required steps to strengthen the party’s base.”

Responding to a query on much-hyped meeting of senior Congress leaders Jyotiraditya Scindia and Digvijaya Singh ending in few minutes, Laxman said, “Both the leaders happened to meet. It was a courtesy meeting but media made it as much-hyped one.”

Speaking about Burhanpur MLA Surendra Singh Shera accusing Congress of showing apathy towards the party workers, Laxman said, “Shera is an independent MLA and has given support to the state government. If he is concerned about Congress workers, he should first join the party”.

NEW DELHI: Outside the Burari home of Ratan Lal , the Delhi Police head constable who got killed on Monday in the violence that has engulfed parts of the capital, locals have put up a poster saluting him.

It features photos of Lal and Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured by Pakistan last year, both sporting handlebar moustaches. Locals at Amrit Vihar rued while Abhinandan could return alive from Pakistan, Lal died on duty.

A relative described Lal as a quiet man who was always kind to his family and friends. Originally from Rajasthan’s Sikar, Lal came to Delhi in 1998 when “he got a job here. He had always wanted to join the police force and was passionate about it”, said his cousin, Dalip Bari, who lives in Sarai Rohilla and runs a small socks manufacturing unit.

The 42-year-old has left behind his wife and three children aged 13, 11 and 6 years. “He never even raised his voice against anyone.

INDORE: Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board has found sound pollution due to boats operating on Narmada water in Omkareshwar .

A two-member team visiting the pilgrimage found that boats were generating 75-80 decibel noise. The team’s visit was prompted after a Spanish tourist on a visit to Omkareshwar filed a complaint with the Central Pollution Control Board about noise and water pollution caused by diesel engine boats in the water body.

The tourist urged the authorities to introduce battery-operated boats and take pro-active steps in regulating noise pollution.

Taking cognizance of the complaint, Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi directed officials in the state board to introduce battery-operated boats at Omkareshwar to eliminate noise and water pollution.

Dr DK Wagela, chief chemist and lab head at regional PCB said, “Acting on a complaint from a Spanish tourist in Omkareshwar, we inspected the ghat and found that boats were generating high noise. We have suggested preventive measures to curb noise and water pollution as battery-driven boats are not workable here looking at high flow of the water.”

Around 350 diesel engine boats operate at Omkareshwar, of which just 169 are registered with the municipal council.

PCB suggested boat operators to use silencers and upgrade outdated models to minimize noise and water pollution.

The state government in 2017 had announced a trade centre in Trichy and 9.42 acres was identified in Panchapur. As the total cost of the project is estimated to be Rs 12 crore, the SPV will have to mobilise Rs 7 crore as their contribution. The state government has provided Rs 5 crore as a grant.

“We have to add new members to the SPV for mobilising the required funds. Trichy trade convention centre is just a step away from becoming a reality,” said N Kanagasabapathy, former president, Tiditssia. The SPV members have approached NIT Trichy seeking architectural support for designing the convention centre.

The convention centre at Panchapur is likely to accommodate at least 2,500 people at a time. Construction work for Trichy trade centre can be launched in the next six months, according to SPV members. Once the proposed design is approved by Tamil Nadu Small Industries Development Corporation (Sidco), sources said that civil work will complete in a year.

Fresh violence erupted on Tuesday after a public gathering was organized near Tower Bazaar

Vadodara/ Anand: Fresh violence broke out in coastal town of Khambhat in Anand district on Tuesday as a mob set a house and a shop ablaze in Mochiwad area of the town. There were however no reports of any person getting hurt due to the riots.

Following the rioting, state home department transferred Anand superintendent of police Makrand Chauhan and Khambhat’s deputy SP Reema Munshi. Three police inspectors were also shunted with immediate effect by the state DGP’s office.

Theviolence broke out after a public gathering organised by the ‘Hindu Samaj’ near Tower Bazaar in the heart of Khambhat. The ‘Hindu samaj’ had given a bandh call on Monday following which shops and businesses in all markets of the town remained closed during the day. The public gathering however witnessed a massive presence.

“The public gathering was not called by any social or political organisation. Residents of Bhavsarwad area, where rioters from the minority community had looted around 25 households apart from damaging their vehicles, had appealed their community members to express solidarity and support them. We did that,” said Khambhat’s former BJP MLA Sanjay Patel, who along with Khambhat’s city unit head of BJP, Pinakin Brahmbhatt, was among those who addressed the gathering at Tower Bazaar.

The political leaders later submitted a memorandum to Anand district collector demanding action against those responsible for the riots.

“The bandh was voluntary. Nobody has enforced the bandh. It was successful as the shops, whether owned by Muslims or Hindus, remained close during the day,” Patel said.

The town has been on the boil since Sunday following communal clash between members of minority and Chunara community in Akbarpura area. As violence that started in Akbarpura spread to other parts of the town, around 30 houses and shops were set ablaze and dozen-odd vehicles were damaged by rioters.

Late on Monday evening toom the town witnessed violence when a police party had raided Lal Darwaja area to arrest residents wanted for Sunday’s communal clash. Around 15 cops were injured after a mob attacked them. One of the constables fractured his hand.

Police have arrested 86 people in connection with the Sunday’s rioting which had left 13 persons injured. The rioters had also damaged a masjid and a temple.

The police has registered four offences at Khambhat police station in which 95 persons along with a mob of 1,000 persons belonging to both the communities were booked for rioting and arson.

Ahmedabad Range IG A K Jadeja told TOI, “The situation was under control and investigation into the riots is on.” On Tuesday, Gujarat DGP Shivanand Jha visited Khambat town to take stock of the situation in the town that has been on edge since past few months.

Trichy: A peace talk held at the Srirangam tahsildar’s office on Tuesday to persuade residents to allow digging a borewell in the Cauvery for Thiruverumbur Water Supply Improvement Scheme ended without any consensus as residents vehemently opposed it.

The water project aims to provide piped water supply to residents in the added areas of wards 61 to 65 in Thiruverumbur. To pump water, the local body has proposed digging a borewell in the Cauvery at Settithoppu near Melur in Srirangam.

While the pipeline installation is complete, the corporation has not launched work on the borewell owing to opposition from Srirangam residents, as they say it would lower the groundwater table in their locality and adjoining cultivations. To appease the residents, a peace talk was held by the district administration on Tuesday.

“The groundwater table has already declined due to the presence of numerous borewells in the Cauvery. Further, the corporation is planning to source 27 MLD of water, it will be a disaster for us if implemented,” said B Hemanathan, a Srirangam resident at the meeting.

Residents urged the local body to dig the borewell near the Grand Anicut by stating that the venue is closer to Thiruverumbur. But the civic body officials said that 95% of the water project work is already accomplished, and the project cannot be shifted to another location.

The explanations put forward by the civic body failed to convince the residents. Officials said that they are interested to implement the project only with the support of locals. “We will discuss with the district administration further to take a decision on implementing Thiruverumbur water project,” an official source said.

Visakhapatnam: The residents’ welfare association of Jagannadharaju Nagar (JR Nagar) near Old Venkojipalem has brought out a booklet on the role of RWAs in rainwater conservation and harvesting. The 30-page booklet describes the different approaches followed by JR Nagar to augment the colony’s water resources.

“It consists of details pertaining to the creation of rainwater harvesting structures, the technicalities involved, and the quantum of water that can be saved by following the guidelines,” KSR Murthy, president of JR Nagar RWA , said. JR Nagar was adjudged the third best resident welfare association in the country in the 2018 National Water Awards. The awards, instituted by the ministry of water resources, carries a cash prize of Rs 1 lakh and a citation.

JR Nagar also won an award for its rainwater harvesting system at the seventh national conference of RWAs in November last year. It is considered a model colony due to its greenery, garbage segregation and solid waste management initiatives and use of solar energy.

The colony has taken up several initiatives, such as systematic pruning of trees, which served two purposes — the trees did not suffer any major damage, and second, there was no power interruption due to overgrown trees criss-crossing power lines in the colony.

Dr Prashant Upadhyay

Vadodara: A local court remanded Dr Prashant Upadhyay, accused in a fraud case, in police custody for four days on Tuesday. Upadhyay had been on the run for the past 12 days after a police complaint of cheating was registered against him at Warasia police station.

Later, another FIR of threatening a woman too was registered against Upadhyay whose activities and lifestyle had become a subject of discussion on social media. “We sought his remand for recovering the money that he has been accused of siphoning off by the complainant apart from gathering other evidences,” said S Anand, police sub-inspector, Waghodia.

Upadhyay was nabbed from a restaurant on the highway at Chikhli in south Gujarat. Police said they tracked down Upadhyay from information received from his followers as well as their intelligence. Upadhyay was nabbed when he stopped at a restaurant on NH-48 near Chikhli on Monday.

Upadhyay is accused of cheating Devraj Pandya of Rs21.8 lakh. Pandya had approached Upadhyay as his business was suffering losses and he needed some solution. Upadhyay took Rs15 lakh from Pandya for some rituals and later Rs6.8 lakh over a period of time for some or the other reasons. When Pandya’s business did not recover, he asked for refund of his money. Upadhyay didn’t give the money back so Pandya lodged a complaint at Warasia police station.

Police had made several efforts to arrest him, but he managed to keep them at bay. Upadhyay had also sought anticipatory bail which a sessions court here denied.

Bhopal has hundreds of heritage structures that need conservation

BHOPAL: The draft 2031 masterplan for Bhopal could give a nod to transfer of development rights (TDR) or tradable floor space index (FSI) available to more than 500 private heritage structures in Bhopal, said sources.

Trading FSI aims to help heritage properties owners carry out much needed repair and restoration works. The cumulative net value of TDR and FSI of these properties is pegged at Rs 2,000 crore.

“TDR and FSI have spurted heritage restoration in many other cities. The move lays the foundation for heritage protection and incentivising it,” said a senior urban development official.

According to Indian National Trust for Art and Culture Heritage (INTACH) listing of heritage in Bhopal, there are 374 structures of importance which are under immediate threat and need conservation. The issue of TDR would be for private property owners who undertake restoration of their heritage. In turn, the private owners would be issued TDR, a certificate to give FSI as compensation or benefit. Heritage property owner can encash the certificate that will allow him or a third party to construct additional built-up area anywhere else in the city.

Bhopal has hundreds of heritage structures that need conservation. Most of these properties are in the walled city. The owners do not have the money to undertake restoration. TDR allows for heritage conservation and at the same time incentivises the heritage owner, according to experts. Similar interventions have taken place in Ahmedabad, which became India’s first world heritage city in 2018.

“Issue of TDR certificates is going to be a complicated deal. The property ownership is not a single ownership in many instances. Government needs to find direct ways to fund and support heritage restoration,” said author and conservationist, Rizwanuddin Ansari.

The TDR policy will reduce the burden on the civic body, besides reducing the project’s cost. It includes interventions like road widening and acquiring of land.

Private builders could also be roped in for development of proper housing along 700 plus slums in the state capital. A similar draft has been proposed for Indore , said sources.

Visakhapatnam: The Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) and Coffee Board are planning to increase coffee cultivation in the agency areas of Visakhapatnam district. Coffee cultivation was increased by roughly 42,000 acres in the last five years and the government now wants to add another 58,000 acres by 2025-26.

Coffee cultivation in the state is mainly done in Visakha agency area, which is known for its very own Araku coffee brand. The weather conditions in the high-altitude tribal belt is suitable for coffee plantation.

The focus now is to increase the area under cultivation and facilitate the export of Araku coffee.

ITDA project officer DK Balaji said their focus is to bring more area under coffee cultivation. “AP today stands third in the country in coffee cultivation behind Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. By 2025, we expect to become second in the country in terms of coffee cultivation. The branding of Araku coffee has helped us gain a foothold in the export market, which was not there earlier,” he said.

ITDA and Coffee Board officials said coffee has become the main driving force of the agency area’s economy and is the single largest employer, with over 1.34 lakh families directly dependent on coffee cultivation, which accounts to nearly 80% of their income source.

“Coffee cultivation has changed the economy of the agency areas. Today, the tribals are able to live with dignity and have financial security. We welcome the state government’s move to increase coffee cultivation area further,” G Rama Gopal, state president of Indian Confederation of Indigenous and Tribal People, said.

They activists also asked the government to slot a space for protests and demonstrations in Jaipur and district headquarters.

Taking on the government, Roy reminded Gehlot that enactment of the accountability Act had been listed by the Congress in its manifesto before the assembly elections in 2018. “By not introducing the Act, the government is not doing good with the people,” said Roy, who said till the Act is introduced, the protest will continue across the state.

Sivaganga: A special public prosecutor (SPP) of the Sivaganga mahila court has been booked by the Sivaganga district police on charges of colluding with a Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offence) Act case accused to make the victims turn hostile in the case during its trial in 2016.

The special public prosecutor has been identified as V Indra Gandhi. Apart from the SPP, the accused in the Pocso case identified as Murugan, headmaster of a primary school in Sivaganga district, was also booked under IPC Section – 195 A (threatening any person to give false evidence) based on a complaint from one of the victims.

Initially, only Murugan’s name was mentioned in the February 8 first information report (FIR). Sivaganga district superintendent of police Rohit Nathan, however, told TOI that the SPP’s name has been added in the case through further statement.

The incident came to light when the SP Nathan reviewed pending cases in 2019. He had written to the district collector in November, to replace the SPP stating that the accused will escape from the clutches of law if she continued in the post. It was forwarded to the additional chief secretary of the state government.

Meanwhile, the victim, who is 13 years now, lodged a complaint with the Sivaganga all women police station stating that Murugan visited her and her grandmother during the course of trial in 2016 and pleaded with them to turn hostile. He told them that he was ready to offer money also.

Murugan took her to the woman public prosecutor, who tutored her to say that the headmaster did not involve in the sexual assault case. Two more victims have also made complaints to the police stating that the public prosecutor tutored them to turn hostile. Meanwhile, Indra Gandhi on Thursday moved the Madurai bench of Madras high court, seeking anticipatory bail.

It maybe recalled that Murugan sexually abused six girl students studying in Class IV in 2015. The incident came to light when one of the students, who was staying in the hostel, narrated the incident to her grandmother in July 2015 when she had gone to her place. Noticing something wrong with the child, the grandmother inquired with her. The girl then told her that she was sexually assaulted by Murugan inside the school bathroom.

When she came to know about the shocking incident, the grandmother took the girl to the police station to lodge a complaint. The case came up for trial in 2016.

Bhopal: Intense lobby has begun in ruling Congress and opposition BJP after announcement of schedule for Rajya Sabha elections. Three seats of the Upper House from Madhya Pradesh are falling vacant and the Congress and BJP are eyeing a clean sweep. Given the strength of parties in MP Assembly the Congress with a strength of 114 MLAs and support of 2 BSP members and a Samajwadi Party MLA must comfortably win two seats.

However, BJP is eyeing two seats and is making all-out efforts to win two seats. The seats falling vacant include those of Digvijaya Singh (Congrees), Prabhat Jha and Satyanarayan Jatia (BJP). Govind Singh Rajput, a minister in Kamal Nath cabinet has raked up the issue of RS ticket and demanded that party must field Jyotiraditya Scindia.

If BJP sources are to be believed party is unlikely to field two-time MP Prabhat Jha as he is a brahmin. Party has already appointed a brahmin, VD Sharma, as state chief while the leader of Opposition in MP Gopal Bhargava and chief whip in assembly Narottam Mishra also both are brahmins. Likewise, Jatia, a senior leader, will have to make way for a young leader.

State Congress leaders claim that Digvijaya Singh being a senior leader could get a second term in the Upper House as he has also been active and vocal during his first tenure. Singh was fielded from Bhopal Parliamentary seat in 2019 by lost against BJP’s Pragya Singh Thakur. If Digvijaya Singh gets repeated, there will be just one seat with many leaders vying for the same.

In the race are former Union ministers Jyotiraditya Scindia who lost Guna, Arun Yadav who lost Khandwa to BJP’s Nandkumar Singh Chouhan, former LOP Ajay Singh who was defeated from Sidhi, former deputy speaker of the assembly Rajendra Singh defeated from Satna and veteran leader Ram Niwas Rawat who also faced defeat from Morena Parliamentary constituency.

Minister Govind Singh Rajput on Tuesday said, “Jyotiraditya Scindia is a capable candidate for both post of state Congress president and the Rajya Sabha.” Rajput is considered close to Scindia and argued that both the positions should be given to the former Union minister of state. “This is my personal opinion and demand from the entire state,” the minister said.

293,['26/02/2020'],Should tax rates be hiked for commercial properties located on main roads?,"This story is from February 26, 2020

With SCB looking to hike commercial property tax , TOI asked readers what the criteria should be to set a tax slab.

While revising the property tax for commercial buildings on the main road will be a wise decision by the authorities, along with it, they must also ensure that adequate facilities are provided in these establishments. Numerous commercial complexes near the main road lack a parking space, washrooms and drinking water facilities. In this case, it becomes immensely difficult for people to enjoy these spaces. With summer already setting in, the situation will only worsen. Hence, the authorities should see to it that these facilities are provided as the tax is hiked. There will be no point in collecting more tax without it being used sincerely. The cause will be lost.

- G. Vijay Kumar

The commercial establishments on main roads should be taxed higher in comparison to the ones in by-lanes as rates of all properties are subjected to their location. A slab system for taxation of the buildings based on their location would generate higher revenues, that can consequently be used to develop and maintain other areas, like the cantonment. It is sort of a domino effect. The government gets more revenue and the people, better facilities. Having said that, the civic authorities should also relax the laws governing the construction of buildings. The main reason that people cite to move out of the cantonment are the medieval rules that still apply there and do not deem fit for the current times. Hence, the areas of main roads should be examined by the authorities and the dwellers should be informed beforehand about the hike in the tax so that the move does not come as a shock to them. This would only help better the procedure of governance in the area.

Property tax should be based on a variety of factors such as the location, value and area of the property in question. The parameters should dictate the tax contribution being made by citizens. In this context, it makes more sense for the owner of land in a prime area to pay more than her counterpart who lives in interior areas. This is based on the logic that the person living in the prime area has more access to various facilities being provided by the government through the taxpayers money, when compared to someone living in a interior location. To make this system really work, the government should conduct regular surveys to access the land values and the appreciation or depreciation of assets.

- Sai Charan

There are several factors that must be taken into account in setting the property tax. For instance, in the Cantonment areas, there are several restrictions on the kind of construction that one can indulge in. Are these restrictions being taken into account when deciding a tax amount? Moreover, there are several ‘commercial’ areas that have been for long ignored by the civic body. When the government cannot do its bit, it is not fair to charge exorbitant amounts just by virtue of the location of the property.

294,['26/02/2020'],Rajinikanth fails to appear before panel probing Tuticorin violence,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Madurai: Actor Rajinikanth, who was summoned by the retired Justice Aruna Jagadeesan Commission probing the anti-Sterlite protest and police firing in Tuticorin, failed to appear before it on Tuesday, and sought exemption citing possible inconvenience to the public due to his visit and prior commitments. However, the commission refused to accept the first reason and said that fresh summons will be served based on the actor’s convenience.

The commission summoned Rajinikanth on February 4, to appear for questioning in Tuticorin at 10am on February 25 for the 19th sitting into the May 22, 2018, incident. He was summoned for his remarks to journalists in Tuticorin on May 30, 2018, that ‘intrusion of anti-social elements’ was the reason for the mob turning violent and eventually ended with the police resorting to firing at them.

On Tuesday morning, the actor’s counsel Ilambarathi appeared before the commission and submitted an affidavit that Rajinikanth could not appear for the above mentioned reasons. On the actor’s request, the commission sent a sealed cover with the possible questions he will be asked. “He will answer them and submit a written affidavit. If summoned, he will appear,” the counsel told reporters.

Counsel for the commission, Vadivel Murugan told reporters that the panel had not accepted Rajinikanth’s reason citing inconvenience to public. “Many political leaders and cine personalities have testified before the commission. Police made proper security measures and there were no inconveniences to the public,” he said.

However, the commission accepted the second reason cited by Rajinikanth that he has shooting commitments and exempted him from appearing on Tuesday. Stating that many witnesses in the past have asked exemption for a particular date, following which they were summoned on a later date, he added that the commission may ask his convenience for the next date and serve fresh summons.

“We have not summoned everyone. His testimony is important in the probe as some of his remarks are of utmost importance for the commission. So we summoned him and asked him to appear,” he said. Murugan added that the commission is confident that he will appear because he is in a responsible position in the society and a law-abiding citizen.

He recalled that the actor on February 4 told reporters that he will extend full cooperation to the commission.

Delhi high court

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court said it would examine on Wednesday a plea demanding an independent judicial inquiry, compensation for deceased and arrest of political leaders for inciting violence in Delhi’s northeast area.

The plea was mentioned before a bench of Justices G S Sistani and A J Bhambhani for an urgent hearing on Tuesday but the court posted it for next day.

Filed by human rights activist Harsh Mander and activist Farah Naqvi, the petition sought setting up of an SIT to inquire into the incident prosecution of individuals who were inciting masses and making hate speeches.

It also urged the court to direct the Centre to deploy Army for maintaining law and order in the national capital and areas where the “communal attack on people are most ferocious.” The plea said that on February 22, around 500 people reached Jafrabad metro station where women were holding peaceful protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The plea also sought directions to the authorities to register an FIR against Kapil Mishra, Union minister Anurag Thakur and BJP MP Parvesh Verma and others who were allegedly “engaged in criminal activities, including rioting and inciting hatred among classes.”

Arguing that the authorities must declare on their website the full list with names of persons who were detained by police and paramilitary forces, the plea asked high court to intervene so that detained persons were provided access to their family members and legal counsel.

A key to ensuing that a proper probe was carried out was that police preserve evidence and CCTV footage of all cameras in and around the protest sites. The plea said the authorities should be directed to ensure the safety and protection of all the protest sites, especially women and children.

“After provocative speech were given by the three prominent politicians liked by the assailants, the assailants carried out multiple brutal attacks against unarmed persons who were protesting against CAA,” the plea claimed.

297,['26/02/2020'],‘Kasturba Gandhi helped steer path of her husband’,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Tushar Gandhi, great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, spoke on ‘Kasturba: A remarkable life’ during SGR Knowledge o... Read More

Nagpur: Kasturba Gandhi put in a lot of efforts to steer her husband’s path, right from his career to freedom struggle. But the biggest injustice towards Kasturba is that she is always seen through the lens of a wife, mother and grandmother and not as a solitary person, said Tushar Gandhi, a thinker and great grandson of the Mahatma, on Monday.

He was delivering a lecture in the 26th edition of knowledge series organized by SGR Knowledge Foundation and Chitnavis Centre on ‘Kasturba: A remarkable life’, at Banyan Hall.

Gandhi brought to light Kasturba’s essence which is often lost in her husband’s shadow. He said, “Like others, even I made the mistake of not recognizing Kastur’s contribution. It is time to take corrective measures and take notice of her role in Mohandas’s life so that future generations know about her real personality.”

Speaking about the earlier days of their life, Gandhi said, “Kastur and Mohandas shared a long journey. Married at the age of 13, they got to know each other from a tender age. They grew up in neighbouring societies and it is possible that they even played together as kids.”

“According to tradition, she had to leave her parents’ home in Porbandar and settle with her husband’s family in Rajkot after marriage. She learnt how to be a wife while living in the confines of the house. On the other hand, Mohandas bought a manual that had instructions on how to be a husband,” he said.

“He used to read a chapter everyday and implement the tenets on Kastur. One lesson in the manual taught him that a wife cannot do anything without seeking permission from her husband. He told Kastur to not step out of the house unless he permitted her for the same. This order bore no fruit as Kastur resisted and walked out anyway,” he added.

“There were a number of failed attempts of controlling her by asking her to seek permission relentlessly and directing her to return to her parents’ home, as instructed by the manual, since she stood her ground,” Gandhi said.

He said, “In his autobiography, Mohandas hails Kastur as his role model for non-violence principles.”

Gandhi said his life goal is to break away Mohandas from the grasp of the Mahatma title and portray him as a common man in the public eye. “When we think of Mahatma, it entails a sense of devotion and we detach ourselves from the thought that his ideologies can be inculcated by common man,” he said.

He held back tears while narrating about what Kasturba might have gone through when Mohandas was in Johannesburg prison.

The silver trophy that was first given in 1942 to the winners

Vadodara: It was in 1942 that the first Maharani Shantadevi Inter-School Tournament first took off in the city under the royal Gaekwadi rule. The Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) has now launched this tournament to tap the talent from schools in the city. The idea is to catch them young and nourish their talent for higher level of the sport, said BCA officials.

“From former test cricketer D K Gaekwad, who played the first tournament in 19 42 to Kiran More, Nayan Mongia, Anshuman Gaekwad, Atul Bedade to Rakesh and Tushar Arothe, every Baroda cricketer has played in this inter-school tourney,” said Milind Pradhan, member, BCA tours and technical committee.

BCA officials had said earlier that there was no club cricket and selection of talented players for Cooch Behar Trophy was done on the basis of Maharani Shantadevi Inter-School Tournament. This tournament was organized every year from 1942 to 2015 when it was suddenly stopped. The then BCA management said that it couldn’t fit this tournament in their annual calendar due to several other tourneys but some accused the association of side-lining school tournament for promoting club cricket.

BCA president, Pranav Amin, however, stepped in this year and decided to re-launch the tournament. “Junior and school cricket are very important for us so we decided to start this tournament again. We will now fix a schedule for this tournament in our annual calendar so that the schools can begin preparations in advance,” Amin said.

Trichy: Desludging operators in the city have been told not to deploy manual scavengers in feacal sludge apart from ensuring necessary safety gear for their workers, during the advocacy meeting organised for desludging vehicle owners and their employees here on Tuesday.

Addressing the gathering, I Ambalavanan, project director of People’s Development Initiatives, urged the owners to purchase safety gears such as boots, mask and hand gloves for all their labourers cleaning septic tanks. “Owners should also ensure that their employees are using the safety gears while on duty,” Ambalavanan added.

Organised jointly by NGOs working in solid waste management, the event saw representatives of desludging operators in various parts of the city participating in an interactive session to explain the hardships they face. There are around 55 desludging operators and 200 workers in the city, organisers said.

“Even if the property owner ask the desludging labourers to enter the septic tanks, the labourers should resist and avoid entering the tanks containing faecal waste. Similarly, cleaning the septic tanks during night should be prohibited,” said Sugantha Priscilla L, senior consultant, CWIS-IIHS.

The desludging operators were also told not to dump the faecal waste in public places but only at the decanting stations of the corporation. Workers that participated in the meeting were encouraged to check their health on a regular basis.

302,['26/02/2020'],Bengaluru: Woman working out in park gets advice on dress code,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Representative image

BENGALURU: A 30-year-old woman who was warming up at a Mathikere park where her husband was jogging on Sunday morning was in for a rude shock: a middle-aged man not only gave her a piece of unsolicited advice on dress code but also filmed her on his mobile.

The man showed the video to other women in the park and they too joined him in telling her what she should be wearing in a park meant for families.

The woman approached a relative working with the police department, and after a few hours, DCP (north) N Shashikumar called her and apologised for the inconvenience caused.

According to the woman, the incident happened around 10.30am at JP Park in Mathikere. While she began to warm up, her husband went for a 30-minute jog. After she finished warming up, the woman removed her sweater and got ready for the workout, and her husband, who returned from the jog, wanted to film her exercising. The woman is a fitness instructor.

Meanwhile, a stranger who was moving around on his two-wheeler inside the park, stopped a few metres away from the couple, parked his vehicle and walked towards her.

“He said, ‘Wearing such clothes is not allowed in this park. This is a family place and not like Cubbon Park or Lalbagh’. He took out his mobile and started filming me,” the woman told TOI.

The woman was startled and her husband told the stranger his wife was not wearing anything objectionable. When the husband tried to reason it out with the stranger, the latter began speaking rudely. The husband promptly filmed the stranger’s uncouth conduct.

The man walked towards a few middle-aged women taking a stroll in the park and spoke to them about the couple. “He told us he showed my video to the women and they also objected to the way I had dressed. One of the women questioned me in a very low tone why I was doing such a thing when I was clearly not doing anything wrong,” she said.

The shocked couple went back to their house in the same area, where they have been living for a year. They are regulars at the park on weekends but Sunday was the first time they were in for the humiliating experience. “I contacted my relative who works with police’s Parihar women’s helpline. A few hours later, I received a call from a DCP who apologised,” she said. “It is a family park, which is why I felt safe to wear what I wore,” she said.

“There was an argument between two parties over dress code. However, the situation was brought under control by locals who intervened. No police complaint was filed,” Yeshwantpur police said.

Representative image

BENGALURU: Cybercriminals targeted the bank account of a Bengaluru hospital and siphoned off Rs 17 lakh after cloning the official sim card attached to it and adding unknown members as online banking beneficiaries.

Spandana Nursing Home authorities have lodged a police complaint and an investigation by cybercrime sleuths is under way.

Hospital sources said the online banking fraud came to light on February 19 after an official postpaid cellphone number attached to a bank account of the hospital chain went defunct. “On February 14, the Airtel sim was suddenly inactive with incoming and outgoing calls being barred. We desperately contacted the Airtel helpline requesting the service be restored, but in vain. After repeated efforts from us — a representative even visited the Airtel kiosk — the sim was finally functional on February 20,” a senior executive from Spandana told TOI.

While the sim was defunct, fraudsters had managed to make 12 online transactions from Spandana Pharma’s Central Bank of India (CBI) account (Rajajinagar branch). They diverted Rs 17 lakh to various unknown bank accounts through IMPS and NEFT.

“We realised the money had been transferred only after the mobile number was restored. We got to know that the culprits had cloned the mobile number attached to the CBI account and had also managed to hack the account and add numerous beneficiaries to it,” added the executive.

Dr S Preeti, chief medical director of Spandana Pharma, lodged the complaint with Yeshwantpur police last week, urging them to track down the fraudsters and retrieve the stolen money.

Investigators suspect that a person well aware of the mobile number being attached to the hospital’s bank account had illegally obtained a duplicate of the Airtel sim card after possibly reporting the original as stolen or lost. The person then used the new sim to operate the bank account and obtain OTPs. The fraudsters also managed to access the CBI account, add six beneficiaries and transfer Rs 15 lakh on February 19 and Rs 2 lakh on February 20. Two more bank accounts of Spandana attached to the same number remained untouched, sources said.

MADURAI: The Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamaath has decided to conduct a statewide protest on February 29 and a prison filling protest on March 18 against the CAA.

Decided at the general body meeting of the TNTJ presided by its state president Shamsullah Rahmani on Tuesday, the event saw a participation of hundreds of members from all over the state. They said that 11 chief ministers have raised their voice against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Tamil Nadu government should pass a resolution against the CAA.

They also condemned the attack on the anti-CAA protestors using weapons including guns who were protesting peacefully in New Delhi. Only those who did not believe in the law would act in this undemocratic manner which was highly condemnable they said.

Home minister Amit Shah who is in charge of the Delhi police should take stern action against the officials who are responsible for these attacks, they said.

TNTJ state general secretary Mohamed, state treasurer Raheem, state vice president Abdul Rehman and others participated.

Meanwhile, the anti-CAA protest at Mahaboobpalayam entered into 12th day on Tuesday which saw a participation of a large number of men and women. The protest was launched soon after the Chennai police used force against the protestors who staged a peaceful protest in Vannarapettai recently. A posse of police was deployed there to make sure the protest did not go out of control.

Students trained under the New-collar Employability Skills Program attend a workshop in Bengaluru on Tuesday

BENGALURU: Last year, BSc student Sona J, 20, signed up for employability skill classes where programming languages, coding, data analysis and cloud computing were taught, skipping her regular classes.

A year later, she says it was the best decision of her life. The girl has been showered with job offers as an analyst in three IT companies, including Wipro and Mphasis.

Sona is among the 2,537 non-engineering students who attended science and cloud computing courses under the New-collar Employability Skills Program late last year. The training was imparted in 23 colleges across Karnataka, NCR and Haryana, jointly by IBM and Nasscom Foundation, and ran up to 250 hours. Almost 1,000 students have landed jobs that were earlier thought to be the domain of engineers.

Bharath Baladhanvi, BCA student of National College, Basavanagudi, comes from a family of priests. His family wanted him to specialise in Sanskrit, but after attending the programme, he plans to enhance the value of Sanskrit through technology. “I have already presented a paper on how Sanskrit can be used as an analytical language,” said the 20-year-old who got offers from four MNCs. “I plan to accept Deloitte’s offer as an analyst,” he beamed.

Prathibha, 19, originally from Hubballi, lost her adoptive parents when she was in high school. She was then forced to go from pillar to post until she ended up at Vijaya College’s Hostel in Bengaluru two years ago. Soon, a relative who supported her education also backed out.

Her computer science HOD got her admitted to an orphanage — Abalashrama in Basavanagudi — two years ago. With a job offer from an MNC, Prathibha, a BSc student, is hoping for a better placement. “If I start working, I can’t stay at the ashram any more. So, I am looking for an offer that can support me well,” she explained.

Box: Few women in IT workforce at higher levels

Geetha Kannan of Wequity revealed the percentage of women in the IT workforce goes down from 34% at the entry level to just 2% at higher levels. She called it ‘leaking pipeline’ and blamed it on the mindset regarding work culture. “It starts from an individual’s mindset. Women are clear about their education but not so much about their career. This needs to change. Organisations must come up with more family-friendly policies,” she explained.

Santhosh Abraham, VP of Nasscom Foundation, said there was a gap in the workforce and women’s visibility in the fields of AI and technology. “Women comprise only 22% of the workforce,” he said.

However, Girish Kamath, VP and MD of Scientific Games, said they do find a lot of women in technical fields but don’t come across as much talent for the positions of artists and designers.

Surat: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has secured the crucial World Bank funding for its ambitious Tapi riverfront project.

The civic body is expected to get Rs 1,500 crore for the project, which is expected to be face changer for the Diamond City’s landscape.

Recently, the WB bank team had visited Surat in January and held series of meetings to discuss the project and funding technicalities.

“Our meetings with the WB have been fruitful and they are satisfied. We are hopeful of getting Rs 1,500 crore for the riverfront development project. This will give a major push to city’s infrastructure,’’ Banchhanidhi Pani, municipal commissioner, told TOI.

According to SMC officials, the total project cost is pegged at Rs 3,904 crore.

“Besides WB funding, we will be raising funds by monetising the land on the riverfront for commercial purpose. Our aim is to expedite the project within the next few months,’’ Pani added.

The first phase of the project is being clubbed with Tapi Shuddhikaran project and work for dredging the river to increase its carrying capacity and construction of embankment on both sides will also be taken up along with the recreational centres and creation of green space.

Surat Urban Development Authority (SUDA) and state government is also involved in the riverfront project as some parts fall in their jurisdiction.

Led by state youth Congress general secretary Charmesh Sharma, a 27-member delegation of youths from Rajasthan, who returned to India on February 18 from Najaf city in Iraq where they were sent to work and were robbed of their visa and passport, met Gehlot at his official residence in Jaipur on Monday and narrated their plight demanding immediate action against the tour and travel agents. The tour agents extorted nearly Rs 1,20 lakh from each of the 27 youths and sent them to Iraq on tour visa instead of work visa, the delegation told CM. Taking a note of the grievances, CM directed SOG to lodge a case against the travel agents and initiate probe, Sharma said. TNN

Yash Chauhan during one of his ‘humourous’ sessions in a city school

Vadodara: Knowing that his funny bones work overtime, Yash Chauhan, a post-graduate student of physics at MS University, wanted to make a career in stand-up comedy. But it all changed when he hit a eureka moment while teaching physics to a friend’s brother in Class X. When his experiments with infusing a little humour to make learning easier hit the jackpot, Chauhan turned into a writer!

Now, Chauhan has written a book for Class X students after getting inspired by his own experiments. The book titled ‘Science in 24 hours’ contains same old lessons but in concise format which help students grasp all the important concepts, and score well too.

“The book contains important points in different colours to identify the complex and easy concepts,” explained Chauhan, who has made videos of these concepts and shared on YouTube where he tries to explain these though jokes.

“There are guides and digest books available in the market. But these only help students learn questions and answers by heart without really understanding the concepts. My book summarizes these in the comic form,” Chauhan said.

The young author claims that one concept which can take 15 hours of teaching in a school can be understood in 40 minutes through his book. To test its applicability, Chauhan also conducted workshops in several schools in Vadodara and got tremendous response from students as well as the school management.

“As I did stand-up shows, so I don’t have stage anxiety and science gives me enough content to make puns and jokes. I cracked jokes during the workshops which attracted students who found the learning easy,” he said.

Chauhan has been approached by publishers and concept schools for publishing the book and teach, but he has turned down all requests. “MSU has shown interest in publishing the book so it is better that a government body publishes the book,” said Chauhan. He now plans to take up research in physics after finishing his MSc course.

Meanwhile, Chauhan is also working on a science book for Class IX students and a physics books for Class XI and XII students.

NEW DELHI: As news of arson and violence poured in from different parts of northeast Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal hit the ground on Tuesday, urging people to refrain from rioting. After a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah, the CM — accompanied by his deputy Manish Sisodia and several other MLAs — went to Rajghat with a prayer for restoring peace.

Kejriwal, Sisodia and others also visited the injured policemen and other victims of the violence at various hospitals. He instructed the authorities to ensure the best-possible treatment for them. “I met the people hurt in the violence, including those who had bullet injuries. I have instructed (hospital authorities) that special care be given to the injured, more beds arranged and doctors roped in,” Kejriwal said.

He later visited the Burari residence of slain policeman, Ratan Lal. “This mad violence should be stopped immediately. Everyone should work for peace. I met home minister Amit Shah and he assured me that, if required, additional forces will be sent to contain the violence. I am continuously tracking the developments,” Kejriwal said. The CM appreciated the role of police officers whom he met at a private hospital. “I met many police officers who were injured in the violence. There was a DCP and an ACP among them. The DCP was severely injured and had to undergo brain surgery. These police personnel risked their own lives to protect others,” he said.

Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, too, visited various hospitals to meet the victims.

Earlier in the day, Kejriwal directed district magistrates and sub-divisional magistrates posted in the riot-affected areas to organise peace marches and meetings with people of all faiths. The CM chaired a high-level meeting at his residence that was attended by AAP and BJP MLAs from the affected areas as well as chief secretary Vijay Dev and officials from fire services and other departments. The fire department was asked to coordinate with Delhi Police and respond quickly to situations that needed intervention. “All issues can be sorted out amicably. Violence will not provide any solution,” Kejriwal stated after the meeting.

“One policeman has died, apart from some civilians. All of them were citizens of the country. Many people have lost shops, houses and vehicles in the violence. This is not a good thing. It is a loss for everyone... someone has suffered loss today... someone will suffer tomorrow,” Kejriwal said. The MLAs told the CM that, in most places, the deployment of police force was far lower than required. “They also complained that police don’t have orders to take action. Unless police get order to fire in the air or conduct lathicharge, they would not be able to take action,” Kejriwal said.

He suggested that the borders of Delhi be sealed to contain the violence. “MLAs from the border areas have complained that people from outside are coming in. There is a need to seal the borders. Those found acting suspiciously must be arrested immediately,” Kejriwal said. He instructed district authorities to ensure that local MLAs were present at the peace committee meetings. The CM also stressed on the need to make announcements for peace from temples and mosques.

Just before midnight on Monday, several AAP functionaries sat on a dharna outside LG Anil Baijal’s office, demanding a meeting with him and action against the rioters. The dharna continued for several hours. They claimed that the rioters were moving around unchecked by police. Through the night, violence was reported from different parts of northeast Delhi. “We were forced to sit on dharna because we were getting distress calls from different areas. Police were not taking calls,” Burari MLA Sanjeev Jha, who was among the MLAs on dharna, said.

317,['26/02/2020'],DHFL News: DHFL assets don’t seem to be proceeds of crime,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Representative image

MUMBAI: A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court observed that the assets of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) did not appear to be the “proceeds of crime” when it recently granted bail to its promoter Kapil Wadhawan in a money laundering case that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is investigating against deceased drug smuggler Iqbal Memon alias Mirchi.

In the detailed order that became available on Tuesday, the court said there did not appear to be a direct relation between the amalgamation of the five dummy companies of the Wadhawans which received loans from DHFL into an entity called Sunblink and the purchase of Mirchi’s three properties in Worli.

Dheeraj Wadhawan, who is Kapil’s brother, controlled Sunblink, which bought the three Mirchi properties in 2010.

The ED had alleged that a part of Rs 1,500 crore received from DHFL by the five dummy companies controlled by Kapil Wadhawan were diverted to Mirchi.

The ED had alleged that DHFL had given a Rs 50 crore loan to Sunblink to purchase Mirchi’s property though there was no property in the name of the company. Apart from that, it said DHFL diverted a loan of Rs 1,500 crore — with interest it is Rs 2,186 crore — to five shell companies in 2011-12 “without any legal authority and under the garb of housing loan etc to individual customers”.

The ED said that while clearing loans to the five entities, procedure was not followed as security for the loan was not created and the issue was not cleared by the board’s finance committee but signed only by the promoters, Dheeraj and Kapil Wadhawan.

Later, the five dummy companies were merged with Sunblink to cover alleged diversions of loans acquired from DHFL.

The court said it did not appear that Wadhawan had played any role in the transactions that had taken place before 2010 in respect of these properties. “There is material to show that those three properties were purchased from Iqbal Mirchi in the name of Sunblink, which was opened in the name of accused Sunny Bhatija by accused Dheeraj Wadhawan and not by the applicant (Kapil Wadhawan),” the court said.

The court said that even while granting bail to other accused Ranjeet Bindra and Rinku Deshpande , it had held that they had not played any role in respect of the transactions that had taken place before year 2010. “Same is the fact situation so far as accused is concerned as allegations against him are that he advanced loan from DHFL to Sunblink in the year 2010 due to which rule of parity can be applied in his favour …” the court said.

Mirchi allegedly used proceeds of crime — money generated from his crimes — to purchase the three Worli properties. The court stated that the ED prima facie established that the three properties are the proceeds of crime.

Pointing to the statements of Bindra and a witness, the court said that it showed that Wadhawan had not participated in the meeting held in London with Iqbal Mirchi in respect of the transactions for those three properties. The court said that this conduct of Wadhawan was a relevant factor while deciding his bail plea.

“It does not appear that any other offence is registered against accused previously, which means that he is not having criminal past due to which, contention of respondent (ED) is not acceptable that if enlarged on bail he may tip off the other suspected persons to evade further investigation and he will tamper with the evidence by pressurising the witnesses,” the court said.

The court said that having regards to these aspects, the nature of allegations available against the accused and the fact that he does not have criminal past, it was of the opinion that he was entitled to bail.

VADODARA: Eight persons of a family living in Chhani were booked for cruelty, dowry and Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Acts after a 22-year-old woman consumed unprescribed medicines to end her life.

Shabnam Pathan, who is currently living with her parents, had consumed medicines after her sister-in-law allegedly called and abused her on February 22. Pathan was asked by her in-laws to leave the house last month as she had not brought any dowry at the time of marriage. Pathan had married Noor Ahmed in 2017 and the couple was blessed with a son last year.

In her complaint, Pathan told police that after their son’s birth, Noor Ahmed did not behave properly with her. He used to fight with her over petty reasons and harass her. Last month, following a heated argument, Noor Ahmed said ‘talaq’ thrice to Pathan to divorce her and left from the house. After her husband left, Pathan’s father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law and sisters-in-law allegedly harassed and asked her to leave their house.

After consuming medicines on February 22, her family members rushed her to SSG Hospital where she is currently undergoing treatment. On Monday, as her health improved, she gave a statement to police based on which an offence was registered at the Fatehgunj police station.

320,['26/02/2020'],Goa seeks Supreme Court stay on Mhadei project,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Supreme Court

PANAJI: The state government on Tuesday filed an application before the Supreme Court seeking an interim relief to restrain Karnataka from carrying out construction or any other activity on the Mhadei .

The chief minister’s office said after senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi pleaded before the bench presided by justice D Y Chandrachud for urgent hearing, the court posted the matter for March 2.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant said by seeking a stay from the Supreme Court against construction activities by Karnataka, the state government has sent out a clear signal that it was serious in protecting the Mhadei.

Sawant also said the opposition’s demand for a white paper on the Mhadei was pure hogwash.

“These are the same people who were in power at that time (when the tribunal announced the award) and should be held responsible for the Mhadei issue. Instead of demanding a white paper, they should support government morally and politically to win the Mhadei battle,” Sawant told TOI.

The state approached the Supreme Court in view of reports that Karnataka will move to start work on its Kalasa-Bhandura water drinking projects on the Mhadei river following interim order of the court.

Last week, the Supreme Court, in an interim order, directed the Centre to notify the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal’s award of August 14, 2018, but said it was subject to the outcome of the petitions filed by the riparian states—Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra—against the award.

The Supreme Court also admitted Goa government’s special leave petition challenging the award and posted it for final hearing on July 15, 16 and 24.

After TOI pointed out how the Centre cannot notify the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal award of August 14, 2018 for another six months as the tribunal had been granted an extension till August 19 for giving the final award, Sawant had said that his government would approach the Supreme Court to “recall” its interim order asking the Union government to notify the tribunal order.

In August 2018, the three-decade-old dispute between the three states over sharing of the Mhadei waters ended with the tribunal rejecting Karnataka’s demand for 36.5tmc ft, and allotted it only 13.4tmc ft, including 3.9 tmc ft for drinking purposes through diversions, against its demand for 7.5tmc ft

Sawant had said that during the hearings in the apex court on July 15, 16 and 24, the state government will furnish enough evidence to prove that Karnataka has diverted water illegally from the Mhadei basin.

The state government, in the special leave petition, wants the tribunal award allotting 3.9tmc ft to Karnataka for drinking quashed.

JAIPUR: Police raided two fake call centres here on Monday and arrested 23 employees for duping people in the US, China and Hong Kong on the pretext of giving them loans.

Police arrested 16 people from the call centre at Shyam Nagar, while seven were held from the hub operating out of Shipra Path. All the accused are well educated, police said.

Vimal Singh Nehra, additional DCP (Jaipur South) said, “We got to know that fake call centres, targeting foreigners, are operating in the city. We began surveillance and after confirming the activities, raided two places and arrested the accused.”

Explaining the modus operandi of the gang in Shyam Nagar, Nehra said: “The accused would gather contact details of Americans using websites like Yellow Page directories. They would then either generate voice calls or email their victims saying their loans have been approved or that they can apply for loans. They would explain the American loan process to their unwary targets and, once a person bought into this, the accused asked them to give a security deposit.”

The accused, however, did not accept cash or cheque. “They asked their victims to buy gift cards from various online shopping sites and then ask them to scratch the number printed on the back of the card. Following th0is, they would sell this number either virtually, or in person, in return for bitcoins. They would then get the bitcoins encashed in places like Ahmedabad,” Nehra said.

The Shipra Path gang adopted a variant model, though the common factor was that they also duped people in the name of loan sanction.

“In this case, the accused got the foreign citizens' data online. They called them giving the same story about loans as the other gang. They made a fake link of a real American finance company and ask the person to give a security deposit of $200 to $500 into that account. Once they got the person’s account details, they sold it to others in exchange for commission. The buyers of this gang were usually based in China and Hong Kong,” Nehra said.

Police are also looking out for other such call centres operating in Jaipur and are questioning the accused for information on this score.

323,['26/02/2020'],Delhi: Plea in SC for ensuring safety of anti-CAA protesters,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Alleging that people are being provoked to attack those holding ‘peaceful’ protests against CAA, former Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad on Tuesday moved the Supreme Court for protection of protesters and sought that an FIR be lodged against those responsible for violence in northeast Delhi.

A day before a bench of Justices S K Kaul and K M Joseph is scheduled to hear plea on removal of protesters from Shaheen Bagh, they pleaded the court that their application be also heard along with other petitions. Agreeing with their plea, the court listed the application for Wednesday.

Referring to the violent incidents in northeast Delhi in which nine people including a head constable were killed, they contended that antisocial elements from nearby villages of Uttar Pradesh had entered Delhi in buses and trucks and were attacking the residents and “peaceful” protesters.

They also said BJP functionary Kapil Mishra had made provocative statements as reported in the media and alleged that he was responsible for inciting and orchestrating the attack. They said police refused to register FIR against the attackers.

“Open threats are now being given to the protesters at Shaheen Bagh that they will meet the same fate as that meted out to peaceful women protesters at Jafrabad, Chandbagh etc. It is therefore imperative that appropriate orders are passed to put a stop to this violence on peaceful protesters and that the guilty are brought to book,” the petition said.

The apex court will examine on Wednesday a report filed by senior advocates Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran who were asked by the court to talk to protesters at Shaheen Bagh to persuade them to shift the site of the agitation. They filed the report after holding talks with the protesters.

324,['26/02/2020'],Giving dropouts one more chance to education,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Hyderabad: Nineteen-year-old Yadamma is engaged to an autorickshaw driver. But despite opposition from home, she is determined to complete her Class X before tying the knot.

Yadamma is one among 20 students, mostly school dropouts, living in a slum near the Miyapur Metro station, who study in a one-room school run by Chottu Ki Education (CKE), a NGO that has been working here for four years now.

When TOI visited the place, it found students — aged from eight to 19 — sitting on mats and loudly reading out Hindi alphabets from the blackboard. Parents of most children are either beggars or do odd jobs.

Founded by Yuvaneshwari K, CKE provides a one-year bridge course to dropouts, and helps them join school again. A scientist with a Hyderabad-based generic pharma company, 33-year-old Yuvaneshwari started the NGO after moving here from Chennai in 2016. Initially, she started teaching child beggars near KPHB Metro station on weekends, along with colleagues and friends. Eventually, with the help of a charitable organisation, she managed to get those children into residential schools. Thus, was born the desire to help more child beggars join mainstream.

“Our first hurdle was convincing parents to let their children study and not beg — that meant a dent in their income. The second challenge was to develop a basic curriculum, which would suit a mixed group. We also had to ensure that when admitted to schools, the students they stayed there and did not return to their old ways,” she said.

So far, CKE has worked with 55 children, of which 28 are now enrolled in mainstream schools. Her team includes about 50 people, including those who provide funds, clothes, guidance on how to help the children, and draw up the curriculum, etc.

“I dropped out in Class VI,” said 15-year-old Raju. “I used to collect garbage for money. But now I enjoy studying here. I love photography and Akka (Yuva) has said if I complete my education she will enrol me in a multimedia course.”

Yuvaneshwari’s efforts have given these children and teenagers a chance to dream of a secure future. “After learning to sew and embroider here, I stitch my own clothes,” Yadamma beams.

Vadodara: Rajveer Jadhav played a captain’s unbeaten knock of 125 runs to help Shreyas High School thrash Baroda High School (BHS), ONGC by 220 runs in the finals of Maharani Shantadevi U-19 Inter-School Tournament here on Tuesday.

Shreyas won the toss and chose to bat first at F B Colony Ground. Openers gave a flying start to Shreyas by gathering 58 runs in 51 balls. Spinner Harsh Dave brought BHS back into the game by claiming two quick wickets but their joy was short-lived.

Jadhav and Devdas Patre came together to stitch a partnership of 156 runs in just 111 balls for the fourth wicket. The duo literally toyed around with BHS bowlers and hit boundaries as well as sixes regularly. Devdas smashed 20 runs in the 32nd over of Krish Prajapati, to reach his 50 in 31 balls. While Rajveer reached his 50 in the 35th over.

BHS bowler Krish Prajapati, leading wicket taker of the tourney, finally broke the record stand, as Devdas was trapped in front of the wicket on 88, with 240 runs on board in 40 overs.

But Rajveer continued with his onslaught by scoring a century in 48th over of the game. Shreyas mounted a mammoth total of 337 runs for BHS boys who displayed poor fielding.

BHS seemed to be under pressure from the word go by losing their first wicket with just one run on board in the second over. Their batsman played too cautiously and scored a mere 21 runs in 19 overs.

BHS skipper Harsh Dave and Jenil Shah tried to salvage their team’s image by putting together 67 runs for the seventh wicket, but it was too little too late. BHS was bundled out for a paltry 117 runs as Shreyas boys erupted in celebrations. Shreyas spinner Hrushikesh ended up with a five-wicket haul.

Rajveer was awarded the man of the match for his unbeaten knock of 125.

The road contracts were put on hold in wake of the row and cleared only later

VADODARA: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is set to take up a series of road works in the city amounting to Rs 56.8crore. Work on 14 new projects have been put up before the standing committee.

The civic body had not taken up any new road works since the last couple of months as a major row had been raked up regarding awarding of road contracts. The issue was raised in letters by the opposition Congress party that also raked it up in the general board.

It was alleged that even state highways that saw heavy vehicle movement had a 45mm surfacing, but the VMC was insisting on 65mm surfacing on roads. The condition for contractors to have a hot mix plant within 30km of the periphery of the city was also questioned by the opposition alleging that this eliminated competition and only a select few bid for road works. The opposition also alleged that contractors who bid below the schedule of rates (SOR) for highways or in rural areas, bid 18% over SOR in VMC.

The road contracts were put on hold in wake of the row and cleared only later. As many as 14 works including those of new roads as well as those of road widening have now been taken up by the civic body. The contractors have been identified and works will be allotted once the standing committee gives a nod.

A source said that the civic body had eventually decided to go with a 65mm carpeting for a better life of the roads. VMC had also inquired with other corporations in the city and was informed that even they were making roads with similar carpeting.

VMC is also in a hurry to take up the works at the earliest as it wants to finish them before monsoon. Officials said that roads that were laid before summer had better a better life due to the heat in summer.

JODHPUR: A TikTok video showing a Dalit schoolboy in Sirohi being pinned against a wall and repeatedly beaten with a stick by another student in the presence of other boys in school uniform has led police to file an FIR under the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

This is the third instance in less than two weeks of alleged attacks on Dalits coming to light through videos circulating on social media.

The latest incident was reported to Barloot police station in Sirohi after the TikTok video went viral on Monday.

Station house officer Manish Soni said on Tuesday that the attack possibly took place outside a school in Jhadoli Veer village and the victim was a Dalit boy. ""We immediately registered a case, but we have yet to identify the culprits and ascertain the reason for the assault ,"" Soni said.

In another case, this one involving four stone quarry workers being stripped, tied and beaten up on Friday night, Jodhpur rural police on Tuesday arrested five men for assault and robbery. SP (rural) Rahul Barhat said the accused snatched Rs 68,000 from the workers, all of them Muslims, after assaulting them through the night.

A Muslim youth suspected of stealing a mobile phone had been allegedly stripped, thrashed and sodomised with an iron rod in Barmer district around three weeks ago. While the victim didn't tell anyone about it, his brother filed an FIR last Thursday after a video of the assault surfaced on social media.

On February 16, two Dalit youths were brutally assaulted by a group of men in Nagaur after being accused of stealing money from a motorbike servicing centre.

331,['26/02/2020'],Government rail police help pregnant woman stranded at station,"This story is from February 26, 2020

The woman delivered a baby girl near the gate of the rural hospital

NASHIK: When a pregnant woman — stranded at the Nandgaon railway station along with her family members — went into labour early on Saturday morning, an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of the Government Railway Police ( GRP ) came to her aid.

Along with his 23-year-old son Chetan, ASI Shivaji Ighe helped look for an available vehicle to shift the woman to a hospital. The patrolling team of the Nandgaon police came forward to transport the woman, who eventually delivered in the police van itself. However, within minutes, the woman was handed over to the Nandgaon rural hospital for further treatment.

Ighe also revalidated the train tickets of the woman and her family so that they don’t have to spend again on tickets to Gonda in UP.

Shivaji and Chetan have received praise from all quarters.

Adityaprasad Jaiswal, his pregnant wife Sumitadevi and their 7-year-old daughter had taken the Kushinagar Express (11015) for Gonda on Friday. Sumitadevi went into labour during the journey. When the labour pains became unbearable, the Jaiswal family got off the train at the Nandgaon railway station at 3.45 am.

Running from one place to another seeking help, Adityaprasad met the personnel of the Railway Protection Force (RPF). The doctor available at the railway station could not help as he did not have the necessary equipment for the delivery. Subsequently, the RPF personnel called up ASI Ighe on his cellphone at 4 pm. Ighe, who was patrolling around the railway station, got there within a couple of minutes. Seeing the condition of the woman, he started checking for an ambulance.

The GRP police said that there were no ambulances around. They even called up the 108 ambulance, but the one in Nandgaon was not available. Officials of the 108 ambulance said that they were rushing an ambulance from Manmad. However, it would have taken more than an hour to reach Nandgaon.

Ighe then called up his son Chetan and asked him to scout for a vehicle to take the woman to the Nandgaon rural hospital. The woman had already started bleeding at the railway station. Chetan came across a patrolling van of the Nandgaon police. The patrolling team rushed to the railway station. The police personnel and the railway doctor arranged for four bedsheets and made the woman lie down in the police van.

While the woman, her husband and daughter, two police personnel and Chetan were in the police van, Ighe said he and the railway doctor followed the van on his two-wheeler. The woman delivered a baby girl near the gate of the rural hospital. Ighe said the family left for Gonda on Monday.

Rohan Borse, the medical superintendent of the Nandgaon rural hospital, said, “Ighe did a great job. Had the police not made haste in rushing the woman to the hospital, the bleeding after the delivery could have been more profuse and that could have put the woman’s life at risk.”

VADODARA: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) had to spend Rs 76 lakh on the repair of four major breaches in drainage lines in the city. The roads had developed cave-ins due to breaches in the western parts of the city.

The cave-ins had taken place near Vasna Jakat Naka on Vasna Road, Malhar Point on Old Padra Road, ABS Towers on Old Padra Road and Shivam Apartment on the Subhanpura-Gorwa Road in the same period. It is believed that settlement of earth below the drainage lines due to the heavy rains this year may have led to the situation. The area has witnessed similar issues in the past too, due to the nature of the soil.

The VMC spent Rs 11.28 lakh to repair the drainage line near Vasna Jakatnaka, Rs 4.63 lakh on the line near Malhar Point, Rs 42.9 lakh for the leakage near ABS Towers and Rs 17.19 lakh on the line near Shivam Apartment.

The expenses had to be done using the provisions to take up works without the standing committee’s nod in wake of the emergency situation. While the expenses have already been made, the works have been put before the standing committee for its formal approval.

334,['26/02/2020'],Demand to release draft on action plan to tackle climate change in Tamil,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Trichy: As the last date to give public opinion and suggestions on the draft prepared by the state on action plan to tackle climate change (TN-SAPCC) got over on Sunday (February 23), environmentalists have sought extension apart from releasing the draft in Tamil.

The state had released its previous action plan in 2013, which the union government has asked to update. While the revised draft was prepared by the state department of environment, it was released a couple of weeks back.

While the union government had given a format on preparing the revised draft, G Sundarrajan of NGO Poovulagin Nanbargal said the state government should have consulted every stake holder including farmers, activists, water experts and local bodies. “It should have been released in Tamil and English, but it was not done and the draft was released in English,” he said.

Nanbargal, who has carried deliberations on the draft, said that apart from identifying vulnerable places in the coastal region, the action plan is silent on many of vital details that should have been part of the draft. “For instance, there was no mention about data on basic carbon emission in the state. Also, dividing the state into seven agro-climatic zones is a flawed concept,” he said.

Stressing on the need to release the draft in Tamil so that it reaches more people, Thaneer – a Trichy based environmental organisation - said the time given to give opinion was very less. “The draft needs to reach farmers who are major stakeholders. Not many people have come to know about the draft as there wasn’t much efforts on publicising the action plan,” said K C Neelamegam, Thaneer secretary.

C Ravichandran, associate professor from Bishop Heber College, said that the draft could have been shared with the academia for opinion. It would have ensured that the state government got varied opinions.

Asked on the demand to release the draft in Tamil, he said not many are aware of climatic changes and the science behind it, which could have limited the state to release the draft in English.

Trichy: A 29-member musical troop of Indian Naval Band from Eastern Naval Command left the audience at National College Trichy ( NCT ) spellbound with its performance on Friday.

The programme, first time in a city college, was organised by the chief inspector of Naval Armament, Trichy, to inspire students.

Considered one of the finest in Asia, Indian Naval band played some diverse music starting with the theme music of ‘Captain America: The First Avenger’.

The troop led by commander Sathish K Champion also played Michael Jackson’s ‘Thriller’ and ‘Cornfield Rock’ before enthralling the crowd with ‘Marana Mass’ song from Rajnikanth-starrer ‘Petta’.

The band also played Ilayaraja’s ‘Ooru vittu ooru vanthu’ from Tamil film ‘Karagattakaran’.

Lauding their performance, chief guest of the event and film composer Karthik Raja held them on a par with Jazz ambassadors – a group of leading musicians which helped the US improve its public image.

He requested the band to perform popular Captain America’s theme once again after asking the children in the last row to come close to the stage so that they can experience music direct from the instruments.

Commander Anup Thomas of Naval Armament, Trichy, said that the event was to inspire youngsters towards armed forces. This was a platform to make youngsters have a glimpse of Indian Navy and the way of the life of the people in the service so that they aspire to take up jobs in armed forces, he said.

She was invited by the Symbiosis Institute of Operations Management ( SIOM ) in the city to deliver the ‘last lecture’ which is a custom of the college to invite a personality to deliver the last lecture for the passing out students as part of their farewell programme — Adyant 2020.

A number of 136 students from the 2018-2020 batch attended the lecture. “Learning should never stop. There are ample of things that you can learn all your life. I had started with a small restaurant in Ahmednagar despite my disability. The journey of a restaurateur to a sportsperson achieving multiple awards was only due to my quest of learning,” she said.

Mother of two daughters, Malik said that she never felt that her life is dull and boring. “My daughters always said, Mom! Your life is so cool. One should never be afraid to fail and keep learning new things in life. Getting the president’s awards four times, making three Limca world records, getting Arjuna Award, Khel Ratna and Padmashri, achieving two honorary doctorates, etc. are all due to my quest of learning,” said Malik.

During the session, Deepa also introduced the other guest of the event. International swimmer and Eklavya awardee, Hansraj Patil, who is also the Naib Tehsildar in Nashik collector office, sang a song despite suffering from cerebral palsy.

The college awarded the top scorers of last three semesters with certificates and announced the name of the best student of the batch.

Sana Rai, who was declared the best student, told TOI “I did not see this coming. I hail from Bengaluru and I have spent the best time in past two years. I have got the job offer from a multinational company in Bengaluru and I am going to miss college.”

Vinay Tawani, another final year student, said “The two hardest things to say in life are hello for the first time and goodbye for the last. It was a beautiful gesture by the college to give us the last lecture.”

The day for the students had much more to follow. They unveiled their year book and the college graffiti wall, enjoyed dance, drama, poetry and band performance, distributed committee certificates and had the last dance.

Picture used for representational purpose only

AHMEDABAD: The high profile visit of US President Donald Trump had the cattle nuisance department running from pillar to post to impound stray cattle and dogs. The exercise will not mean much the long run, as these impounded animals will be back on the roads.

In the last week, AMC workers caught 48 cows and buffaloes and 55 dogs from the area around Motera and the airport. Officials said that according to policy, the dogs will be sterilized and released from wherever they were caught.

“We have a policy that the owner has to pay a fine and to get their cattle back and this will be done,” said deputy municipal commissioner Mukesh Gadhvi.

Officials at the zone-level said that the AMC has in many cases lodged police complaints against such cattle owners, but in this case no complaints have been registered. The officer said that it was also noticed that not all dogs had been caught but most of the cattle on the roads were caught.

The Gujarat high court had last May directed that “the concerned authorities enforce appropriate laws in connection with stray animals. Appropriate preventive as well as curative measures will be taken by the concerned authorities to prevent this problem more effectively during the monsoon period. It is also directed that appropriate authorities shall take appropriate action against the owners or persons leaving their cattle to stray on the roads so that such persons are not tempted to repeat the same again.”

The officer said that it has been noted in many cases that the cattle impounded are caught again and again and in each time the owner gets them released after paying the fine.

Accused in police custody

SURAT: Daman police nabbed former Daman District Panchayat president and BJP leader Suresh Jagu Patel alias Sukho in Mohali in Punjab on Monday. He will be soon brought to Daman on a transfer warrant, police said. Cops were in search of Patel, who was on the run for several months after his name cropped up during investigation in a double murder case.

Police arrested Patel and his aide Sajidali alias Salim Chaudhary from Mohali on the basis of specific information. The accused tried to snatch gun from a cop leading to one round being fired accidentally. The bullet hit one person who was accompanying the accused.

A separate offence of firing has been registered in Mohali. ""Patel and his associate have been arrested by police in Mohali. The local police are investigating yesterday's incident. Daman police will take custody of the accused on transfer warrant once their custody with local police ends,"" said a police officer of Nani Daman police station.

In April 2018, Ajay Raman Patel and Dhirendra alias Dhiru alias Dhiriya Durlabh Patel were shot dead by some assailants and an offence was registered at Nani Daman police station. The complaint in this connection was lodged by Chhotu Patel. Police have so far nabbed Noon Majam, Mohammad Hasan Abdul Aziz Siddiqui, Rashid Murtaza and a couple of other accused in the case.

""Our investigation revealed that Patel was the mastermind of the murders and his name was later added in the complaint. Police went to register his statement on October 21, 2019 at his office, but he managed to escape. He has been on the run since then,” police said.

His elder brother Ramesh Patel alias Michael is a bootlegging kingpin. Michael had earlier been arrested in multiple cases by cops of different police stations of south Gujarat . Ramesh was controlling the entire bootlegging network of IMFL that was being pumped into Gujarat. Enforcement directorate had initiated action against Ramesh under Prevention of Money Laundering Act and seized his properties and cash worth several crores.

Patel and his wife were also booked in the past in a few offences of bootlegging after seizure of liquor by Valsad police.

342,['26/02/2020'],State stays appointment of 8 new standing panel members,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Nashik: The state government on Tuesday stayed the appointment of eight new members of the Nashik Municipal Corporation’s ( NMC ) standing committee following complaints by Shiv Sena group leader Vilas Shinde.

Mayor Satish Kulkarni had on Monday declared the names of eight new members of the standing committee — four from BJP, two from Shiv Sena and one each from Congress and NCP — after the term of eight former standing committee members came to an end.

In the 16-member standing committee, the BJP has got nine seats, while Sena has four and Congress, NCP and MNS have one member each. The quota of standing committee members to the political parties is decided on the basis of their strength of corporators .

During the 2017 civic elections, the BJP had won 66 seats and Shiv Sena got 34. Accordingly, the comparative strength of both BJP and Shiv Sena was 8.65 and 4.45, respectively. Hence, BJP had got a quota of nine members, while Sena had got a quota of four members.

The total number of BJP corporators later reduced from 66 to 64 and Sena’s number increased to 35. Owing to this the comparative strength of BJP reduced from previous 8.65 to 8.39, while Sena’s increased from 4.45 to 4.59.

After the drop in comparative strength of BJP, Sena had demanded the mayor to reduce the BJP’s quota to eight members and increase Sena’s quota from four to five members. The proposal, however, was rejected by the mayor.

Vilas Shinde, hence, complained to the urban development department of state government. Accordingly, the urban development department stayed the appointments of new eight members on standing committee. The stay will continue until the municipal commissioner takes decision on the issue.

A two-day All India Railway Time Table conference, to be held on February 27 and 28 in Bengaluru, will discuss changes in the new railway timetable.

One of the suggestions include diverting train 16231/16232 Mayiladuthurai – Mysore express, which is operated with a full capacity between Trichy and KSR Bengaluru, via Namakkal to save running time and eliminating an engine train reversal at Erode.

As there is a huge demand for the train service to Bengaluru and Hubli from delta districts, a new daily express train service between Belagavi and Kumbakonam, Thanjavur via Hubli, KR Puram, Banaswadi, Salem may be introduced.

There exist a long-pending demand for a direct train between Thanjavur and Mumbai CST. Hence a new bi-weekly express train service between Thanjavur and Mumbai CST via Kumbakonam, Villupuram, Arakkonam, Renigunda, Mantralayam Road, Pune may be introduced.

Frequency of the well-patronised trains 16779/16780 Rameswaram – Tirupathi Express may be increased to daily. This will be the restoration of erstwhile daily express train operated during the meter gauge era. Arrival time at Tirupathi may be advanced to reach around 7am.

Timings of train 56113 Mayiladuthurai-Trichy passenger may be suitably changed to connect train 76833 Trichy-Salem DEMU at Trichy.

A new daily day express train to connect Mayiladuthurai, Kumbakonam and Thanjavur with Palani, Pollachi may also be introduced.

AHMEDABAD: A teenage boy, who put in the lockup at Kagdapith police station, fashioned a noose from his shawl and hanged himself from the top bars of the lockup gate. CCTV footage shows it took nearly 10 minutes till he finally succumbed, at 10.20pm on Monday. Surprisingly, his action did not draw the attention of a single cop in the police station at a relatively busy hour, 10.20pm.The family of the deceased said their son was just 17, but the cops insisted that he was an adult.The suicide has raised serious questions about the functioning and attitude of the police. The foremost question is why was he locked up despite the boy and his family insisting that he was a minor.He was detained under Section 151 of the CrPC after allegedly getting into a scuffle with a resident of Hiralal Chawl in the Raipur area of city.Section 151 allows a police officer to arrest, without orders from a magistrate and without a warrant, a person, if it appears that the commission of an offence cannot be otherwise prevented.“The youth was sitting in an autorickshaw and talking on his phone late on Monday night when the auto-owner objected and they got into a heated argument. The two, then, allegedly assaulted each other but as the auto driver called the police, the cops caught the boy and took him to the police station,” said a police official.Sources in the police said that the cops did not make a station diary entry about his arrest and put him in the lockup. They reportedly threatened to book him under grave charges, which scared him, after which he took the extreme step.As the youth’s family staged angry protests, police suspended the police station officer (PSO) of Kagdapith. “The youth committed suicide by hanging himself from the top bar of the lockup gate. He tore a shawl, which he was allowed for the night, to make a noose and hanged himself,” said Inspector U D Jadeja of Kagdapith police.Jadeja said the deceased was “19 or 20 years” and had been caught for first time, after he fought a neighbour. “We have CCTV footage of the lockup which shows him committing suicide,” said Jadeja.Prakash Jhala, a distant relative of the deceased, said that the youth was born on May 20, 2002.“Even as the youth and his family told the police he was a minor, four cops had first thrashed him near his home. He was again beaten up inside the police station. The cops also threatened to book him under serious charges. The young boy could not bear such humiliation and committed suicide,” said Jhala.The family was informed of the incident half an hour after the youth had hanged himself. The deceased’s family and relatives protested at Kagdapith police station for a day and later at VS Hospital, where the postmortem was conducted.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74310319,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-234064,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/youth-hangs-self-on-lockup-bars-in-presence-of-cops/articleshow/74309390.cms

Nashik: The civic body, in order to effectively deal with pollution of river Godavari and other environment issues, has increased the budget allocation from Rs 1.20 crore allocated for financial year (FY) 2019-20 to over Rs 8 crore for the FY 2020-21.

Bulk of the amount would be used for cleaning Godavari and making it pollution free. The NMC has already set up Godavari conservation cell to deal with river pollution. The civic administration has also proposed monetary fines on erring residents found throwing garbage, washing clothes and vehicles, dumping nirmalya (puja waste) into the river.

While presenting the budget, municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game said special attention is being given on cleaning the river on the stretch between Holkar bridge and Talkuteshwar bridge.

The NMC has also proposed robotic excavator to clean the river and remove silt. The monetary provision has been made in the budget under the Godavari conservation cell. A trash skimmer machine has already been deployed by the civic body for cleaning the river.

Apart from this, another robotic excavator is to be procured to clean Godavari and its three tributaries — Nandini, Waldevei and Wagahdi.

Earlier, the civic administration would clean Godavari manually through a contractor who would remove water hyacinth, filth and other waste from the river.

The one-year term of the contractor is ending on February 29 and the civic administration is not willing to continue with him after the contract ends. Now, mechanical cleaning of Godavari and its tributaries will be carried out.

The NMC has also proposed buying new machines to clean the drainage lines. For this necessary financial provision has been made in the budget.

The cattle squad picked up a stray cow from outside the residential society at about 10 pm. The cow had delivered a calf 15-days-old back. The cattle owner had sought Kachadiya to help release the cow.

“I called the officer to release the cow as it had a 15-days-old calf. Despite of repeated calls, the officers did not released the cow. In the last call, I was so frustrated that I used abusive language,” admitted Kachadiya.

A senior officer of the cattle squad of SMC told TOI, “We have been getting complaints from Varachha and many parts of the city regarding stray cattle. It was a routine work of the squad members. But the councillor used abusive language with our staff member. He did not know about the calf.”

351,['26/02/2020'],Roadshow diplomacy with world leaders is new trend,"This story is from February 26, 2020

On Monday, Ahmedabad wore a festive look to host a massive rally in honour of US President Donald Trump

AHMEDABAD: Roadshows by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to honour foreign counterparts has emerged as a new trend in political diplomacy. On Monday, Ahmedabad wore a festive look, its streets all decked with up lights and posters of ‘Namaste Trump’, to host a massive rally in honour of US President Donald Trump .

“The roadshow diplomacy is something new. It speaks of the showmanship of both Trump and Modi. Both believe in hype,” said Ghanshyam Shah, a political expert. The 22km roadshow on Monday by Trump and Modi from Ahmedabad airport to the Motera stadium saw people flocking in large numbers to catch a glimpse of the two world leaders.

Dance groups and singers from several states of India performed on stages dotting the route. Soon after the roadshow, Trump announced that the two countries will soon enter into a $3 billion deal in the defence sector. He said this at the Namaste Trump event at the Motera stadium.

This is not the first time that a world leader has accompanied Modi in a roadshow. In September 2017, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was with Modi on a roadshow that showcased the culture of Indian states.

They had travelled 8.5km to the Sabarmati Ashram in an open vehicle decorated with garlands. Soon after the roadshow, the two prime ministers set the foundation stone for the multi-billion dollar bullet train project, to be undertaken with the financial assistance of Japan.

In January 2018, Modi along with his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu embarked on a roadshow from the airport to the Sabarmati Ashram. The Israeli prime minister’s six-day visit has boosted trade ties between the two countries. All the three roadshows by Modi with world leaders were held in Ahmedabad in his home state. Also, two of them were held in an election year. While US goes to polls this year with Trump’s re-election a possibility, the 2017 roadshow with Abe was held in the assembly election year for Gujarat. Also, Japan was up for elections, and Abe won the polls.

352,['26/02/2020'],MVA govt orders probe into BJP-ruled NMC’s project,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Nagpur: The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Tuesday ordered inquiry into BJP-ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s garbage-to-compost project at Bhandewadi dumping yard. Urban development department minister Eknath Shinde assured action against NMC office-bearers and officials, if found guilty.

On the second day of budget session of the state legislature in Mumbai on Tuesday, West Nagpur MLA and Congress city president Vikas Thakre raised the issue and alleged Rs250 crore loan scam by the project operator Hanjer Biotech Energies Private Ltd and various irregularities by NMC office-bearers and officials.

BJP MLA from Central Nagpur Vikas Kumbhare and six others have also signed the question raised by Thakre.

Replying to the query, Shinde said, “Inquiry will be conducted at the level of divisional commissioner and responsibility will be fixed. Those found guilty will be brought to book, be it office-bearers or officials.”

Thakre claimed that Hanjer has duped Punjab National Bank of Rs250 crore and CBI has already started an inquiry. The project operator availed loans citing garbage projects in Nagpur and other cities. However, it utilized most of the loan amount for other purposes, he claimed.

“Hanjer took a loan of Rs50 crore for Nagpur project though the value of the existing plant at Bhandewadi dumping yard is less than Rs50 lakh. NMC had paid Rs18.89 crore to Hanjer ignoring the fact that the operator could not process even 200 metric tonne (MT) garbage of the total capacity of 600 MT,” he said.

Thakre also said that NMC was supposed to get entire plant free of cost in March this year, but Hanjer, in nexus with NMC officials, removed all machineries from the yard.

“NMC has deposited its share of compensation with the NGT, but Hanjer has not,” he pointed out.

In written reply to the query, Shinde said, “Hanjer had submitted fraud bills of Rs18.89 crore to the NMC and received money. The Nagpur municipal commissioner has informed that the operator has even dismantled the plant and took away all machineries without the permission of the civic body and sold the scrap.”

Shinde also revealed that Hanjer did not operate the plant for 544 days between October 29, 2013 and June 21, 2018, for which the NMC levied a fine of Rs2.11 crore on the operator. “NMC has stopped paying tipping charges of Rs330 per MT to the operator from October 2016 and the civic body has not disbursed Rs1.10 crore to Hanjer,” Shinde said.

Thakre pointed out that NMC general body had constituted a committee to probe the matter. “Even after five months, the committee has not submitted the report. Action including suspension and registration of FIR should be taken against the then mayor, office-bearers and officials,” he demanded.

Nagapattinam: A wooden box which washed ashore near Velankanni created a flutter among fishermen on Sunday evening.

The Coastal Security Group (CSG) authorities received information from fishermen that a wooden box had washed ashore at the Seruthur coast.

A team rushed to the spot and retrieved it. They suspected it to contain heroin and informed customs officials in Nagapattinam.

A team from the customs department headed by superintendent S Prem Babu took custody of the box which was partially burned. The powder was sent to Anna University in Nagapattinam for lab test. However, the tests turned negative, officials said. The box contained seashell powder.

Seashell powder costs Rs 4,000 per kilogram and can be used for medicinal purposes, said Prem Babu.

“The powder may have been used to cheat smugglers,” he said.

“This wooden box looks like a hoax. It may have been used to cheat a gang which then threw it away,” another official said.

Smuggling narcotics, particularly ganja to Sri Lanka via Kodiyakarai near Vedaranyam, is not uncommon, official sources said.

Narcotic Control Bureau officials have foiled several bids to smuggle narcotics in and around Kodiyakarai and have detained Sri Lankan nationals.

Representative image

NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) has increased its annual budget for the financial year 2020-21 by Rs 75.43 crore.

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game on Tuesday submitted a draft budget of Rs 2,161.79 crore to the standing committee of the NMC for approval.

The standing committee will now discuss the proposal during a special meeting to be held on Wednesday. The annual budget of the NMC for the financial year 2019-20 was Rs 2,086.36 crore, and it has been increased by 3.5% for the upcoming fiscal.

“There was a total demand of Rs 3,000 crore from various departments. But we have finalised the budget considering our revenue generation and liabilities. We have projected income of Rs 2,161.79 crore and outlay of Rs 2,160.48 crore, with surplus amount of Rs 1.31 crore during the financial year 2020-21,” Game said.

The major thrust for revenue generation would be on property tax collection and the target has been raised to Rs 148.86 crore. Moreover, the NMC has also increased the water tax collection target to Rs 65 crore.

The draft budget has also increased the outlay for the city bus service by making an allocation of Rs 70 crore — an increase of Rs 48 crore as compared to the present fiscal.

The NMC has planned to deploy 400 CNG, electric and diesel buses in phases and the service is expected to begin from April. The civic body has also formed a special purpose vehicle, Nashik Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd, to monitor the operations of the city bus service.

Presenting the budget, Game said that the budget for the financial year 2020-21 has been prepared based on the necessity of the works, availability of funds and technical approval. “The liabilities of the works already undertaken and expected revenue generation have been considered while preparing the outlay budget,” he said.

“Focus has been given to improve city’s road connectivity. The missing links on ring roads and major roads are to be developed. Moreover, tarring of macadamised roads is to be done,” he added.

The budget also includes necessary provisions for constructing bridges on nullahs and canals in 22 villages falling under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation. These villages were included in NMC’s development plan for the city over two decade ago.

The budget includes provision of buying two road sweeping machines, developing new bus depot at Adgaon Naka and Tapovan at a cost of Rs 40 crore, provision of Rs 135.33 crore to improve sewage treatment network and build new sewer lines, Rs 35 crore to develop new sports grounds in all six divisions along with other sports-related activities.

The budget also includes provision of Rs 24.23 crore for the garden department. The civic body has also proposed renovation of projects like Dadasaheb Phalke Smarak.

356,['26/02/2020'],NMC begins razing Ambekar’s famed ‘Rs10 crore bungalow’,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Nagpur: The sprawling 10,000 square feet land at Darodkar chowk on which tea boy-turned-don Santosh Ambekar’s constructed a mansion valued at Rs10 crore was partially demolished by the enforcement wing of the Nagpur municipal corporation (NMC) on Tuesday.

The demolition of the remaining part of the structure will continue on Wednesday. Nearly 8,640 sq feet of the don’s den was constructed illegally.

This is round two of the demolition process carried out by NMC.

In the first leg that took place on December 4 last year, the top storey and a shop on the ground floor of Ambekar’s another four-storeyed property, ‘Athawan’, also at Darodkar chowk, were demolished.

Ambekar and his close aides were arrested in October last year for duping and threatening a Gujarat-based businessman. At least 13 offences were registered against Ambekar following various complaints since October last year. He was also booked for the fifth time under Maharashtra control of organized crime Act (MCOCA).

NMC sources told TOI that Ambekar constructed the bungalow on the lines of Rajput-style architecture. He illegally amalgamated three plots and also took unauthorized possession of a part of a garden as well as a portion of the land meant for a gymnasium.

As per the records, Ambekar had clubbed the plots owned by him, his wife Neha and one Amarchand Mehta to construct the bungalow. The don had carried out illegal construction on 7,766 sq feet land owned by Mehta, 651 sq feet of construction on Neha’s plot and more than 226 sq feet construction on the plot owned by him. The three plots were earmarked for demolition.

Asst municipal commissioner of NMC’s enforcement department, Ashok Patil, stated that a notice was served to Ambekar on December 16 last year under relevant sections of the Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance And Redevelopment) Act, 1971. “The notice of demolition was challenged and an appeal was filed but it was subsequently vacated on February 24 this year. The occupants had claimed that there was a second appeal but no documents were produced,” he said.

Earlier in the day, Ambekar’s family feebly tried to convince Patil that there was an appeal filed by their advocate. Ambekar’s son Sanchit, who is in his early 20s, showed Patil some documents but had to relent later as the NMC officer said they lacked substance to halt action. Patil was accompanied by enforcement inspector Sanjay Kamble and other staffers from NMC’s Gandhibagh Zone.

Senior PI Narendra Hiware of Lakadganj police station, API Pankaj Dharge of crime branch and other officials were present with sizeable manpower. Women cops had to be deployed as Ambekar’s wife Neha and other relatives were present.

Hiware said that adequate time was given to the Ambekar family to produce documents to stop the NMC action but nothing concrete was produced.

Two JCB excavators and a poclaine machine were pressed into action after a delay of around one-and-half hours. Till sunset, a substantial portion of the bungalow was demolished from the northern side.

357,['26/02/2020'],Duo held after 2 yrs for killing couple,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Trichy: A probe into the double murder of a couple brought to light the role of two youngsters in the murder for gain incident nearly two years ago. The duo was also involved in the murder of one of their younger brothers in 2017.

A special team from the Siruganur police station attached to the Trichy district police arrested S Kishanth, 21, an engineering graduate from Chathiramanai in Perambalur district and K Palaniasamy, 21, from Vaalaiyur in Trichy district for murdering A Ramesh, 37, and his wife R Latha, 38 on April 23, 2018. A two-wheeler, a gold chain, ring and Rs 3,000 cash were stolen from the house.

Though six police teams carried out the probe, the case remained untraceable for nearly two years. Deputy inspector general of police, Trichy range V Balakrishnan and superintendent of police, Trichy Zia Ul Haq insisted the investigation officers on cracking the case at the earliest.

Accordingly, deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Samayapuram A Rajasekar, Siruganur inspector Manivannan and their team took up the probe. A three-member team visited police stations in several districts to check if there was any trace of Ramesh’s stolen bike. A probe by a constable of the special team at Veppur police station in Cuddalore district found that a bike involved in a road accident was seized there. The constable found the number plate mentioned in Tamil and he checked the chassis and engine numbers with that of Ramesh’s stolen bike. Further inquiry revealed that Kishanth and his friend P Manikandan, 21 of Sengunam in Perambalur had met with the accident when they were travelling from Puducherry to Perambalur few months after murdering the couple.

The special team picked up Kishanth and inquired with him. During inquiry, Kishanth revealed that his craving for a new bike prompted him to conspire with Palanisamy to steal Ramesh’s new vehicle. As planned, the duo went to Ramesh’s house and attempted to enter the house. Ramesh and Latha woke up but the duo clobbered them on their head with a steel rod. They took the valuables and the bike.

“Their intention was to just lift the bike and not to murder them. The accused were under the impression that couple were unconscious. They came to know about their deaths later and absconded after changing the number plate in Tamil. The police teams probed from several angles but there was no headway until the bike was identified,” DSP Rajasekar told TOI.

While Palanisamy enrolled in a degree course, Kishanth was working in Puducherry. Inquiry with Palanisamy revealed that he had also murdered his younger brother K Perumal, 18, in 2017. Kishanth had aided Palanisamy in the murder. The Siruganur police had closed the case as suspicious death as his decomposed body was found floating in a water body and the postmortem also could not establish anything. Now, police arrested the duo in this case also.

Police produced the accused in the Lalgudi court on Tuesday, which remanded them in judicial custody. The stolen valuables were recovered.

Madurai: Expedite the ongoing smart city works or put it on hold till the Chithirai festival concludes, urge city merchants and traders to the Madurai corporation.

Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association, Ashraf Yusuf said that the four Masi Streets, and Mahal Vadampokki Streets near the Meenakshi temple had been dug up for various works. “The unplanned and slow pace at which the work is undertaken is causing heavy loss to the traders, especially the textile traders,” he said.

The pits and holes dug up are so deep in the Masi Streets that the people are afraid of walking on those streets. “A fall in these roads could prove fatal for elderly people,” said Kumaran S a resident of Vadampokki Street. It was also because UGD, rainwater harvesting systems and road laying works are being carried out simultaneously.

Yusuf said that the dust particles are settling on their goods, making it difficult for the traders to even showcase their goods. “The four Masi Streets is the go-to place for the denizens for all their needs be it grocery, notebooks, electrical gadgets, electronics, hardware, paints, textiles, garments and jewellery. Now all these shops are facing a loss due to the ongoing works.

The four Masi Streets around Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple, frequented by tourists is now full of iron rods and cement slabs, posing danger especially in the evenings. Thousands of hawkers and roadside vendors are also affected by the dust from these works and their livelihood has been badly affected for the past 75 days, he said.

Traders say that the corporation should take steps to complete at least the road works before the Chittirai festival which will begin in the month of April. Lakhs of people come to the temple during these 15 to 20 days and they would be inconvenienced. Also, the car festival would also be held on these streets. TNN

Representative image

NASHIK: In a bid to release the stress of teachers and students of the Nashik Municipal (NMC) schools, mayor Satish Kulkarni came up with a laughter yoga initiative. The NMC organised a laughter yoga workshop for its school teachers at the Kalidas Kala Mandir and it was attended by nearly 300 teachers.

In the two-hour workshop, the teachers were told about the importance of laughing and how it can make them free of stress, which, in turn, can improve teacher-student interaction.

“Teacher-student relationship has a life-long impact on a child. We want this relationship to be healthy. If the teachers are stress-free, they will be able to help the students better. Laughing plays a vital role. A happy teacher will make a happy student,” said Devidas Mahajan, the NMC education officer.

The civic body is planning to hold more such workshops. A plan to gather 10,000 students in a big school ground and conduct a laughter yoga workshop with them is also afoot, said Mahajan.

After learning laughter yoga at the workshop, the teachers will be able to squeeze in a 10-minute session for the students in their daily school schedule.

Nitin Nandkar, a teacher at NMC School No. 49, said, “The students cannot sit down and listen even for 15 minutes. We learnt today that if they laugh out the carbon dioxide, their minds will be able to concentrate effectively and their capacity to be attentive in the class will increase.”

Manisha Chaudhary, a teacher from NMC School No. 10, said, “We are always in some or the other sort of stress. If we laugh, our body releases happy hormones (endorphins). We need to tell this to our students also that laughter is the best medicines.”

SMC officials said that transplantation of the trees was not possible

SURAT: Dozens of trees were chopped off by the Surat Municipal Corporation ’s (SMC) town planning department for the widening of the main road connecting the upcoming Pal-Umara river bridge in Umara on Tuesday.

The road alignment work was taken up a week back. The road is being widened to 80-feet till the approach end of the bridge in Umara.

On Tuesday, dozens of full-grown trees lined up on both the side of the main road opposite Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) were chopped off by SMC workers for road widening.

Sources said there are more than 150 trees that would be chopped off under the road widening project.

Talking with TOI, garden superintendent, Dr S J Gautam said, “There is no other alternative but to chop the trees. We will be removing all the trees falling under the road alignment.”

Dr Gautam added, “The transplantation of the trees is not possible as there are lot of underground utility lines including water, natural gas, electricity etc. We will be taking up massive tree plantation drive on both the sides of the road once the widening project is completed.”

An environment activist asking anonymity said, “The civic body is doing work hastily to take up the construction of the Pal-Umara bridge at the cost of hundreds of trees.”

Kerala high court (File Photo)

KOCHI: A high court judge, on Tuesday, said he had received a letter, threatening to burn him alive if he ordered to hand over the Kothamangalam church to the Orthodox faction.

Justice P B Suresh Kumar revealed the receipt of the threat while pulling up Ernakulam district collector for not implementing the court’s order.

Justice Kumar said he won’t mind being burnt alive, but the court’s order should be implemented. The court registry has handed over the letter to the police.

Earlier, the court summoned district collector S Suhas and criticized him for not implementing its order to take over Kothamangalam church and hand it over to the Orthodox faction.

Justice Kumar criticized the collector after noticing his absence despite a directive on a contempt of court case filed by the Orthodox faction. The contempt case was filed by Orthodox priest Thomas Paul Ramban through advocate Roshen D Alexander.

During the morning session, the contempt of court case was listed as the first one to be heard. On noticing the collector’s absence, the judge directed that he must be present within five minutes.

The collector reached the court after around 15 minutes, and explained that earnest efforts were taken to implement the order but it failed as one of the factions opposed and some of them threatened to commit suicide if it was implemented. He also sought two more months to implement the order.

Pointing out that there was no stay on the order, the court said it could not allow the time the collector had sought.

The court also criticized that even though the collector was liable to implement the order, he was not viewing the matter seriously. Delaying the implementation of the court’s order by referring to suicide threats was equal to showing disrespect to the court. Though many days had passed since the order was issued, the state government had not done anything to implement it, the court said.

Further, the court said physical strength of some had become successful now and the inability to implement the court’s order was a shame for the state police. It shows the breakdown of law and order machinery.

Non-implementation of the court’s orders would result in people losing faith in the judiciary and would lead to collapse of the justice-delivery system, the court said. As the state government and the police had failed to implement the order, the court could direct central forces to carry out the order. It could also jail the collector as part of contempt of court proceedings, the judge said, while reserving the contempt of court case for pronouncing orders.

NAGPUR: District and sessions judge SA Ali on Tuesday sentenced four of a family to life imprisonment for the murder of Imrat Rana and his brother Puranlal in Samta Nagar in June 2016.

The murder had triggered a law and order problem in North Nagpur , including crowd chaos at Jaripatka police station. Police had to resort to lathicharge to disperse the dissenters.

The foursome convicted for the murders under section 302 and rioting under section 149 of the Indian penal code (IPC) were identified as Prashant Chamke, Zanak Tomaskar, his son Ankush and son-in-law Shivmohan Malik. They will also face an additional one year of imprisonment if they fail to pay the Rs2,000 fine.

The court also convicted them under section 304 (II) for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and also 149 sentencing them to imprisonment for up to five years and also a fine of Rs1,000. In case of a default, they would face an additional jail term.

Under section 143 of the IPC for unlawful assembly, the four have been slapped with three months of imprisonment and a fine of Rs500. Another one year of imprisonment and a fine of Rs100 was slapped on the foursome under section 148 of the IPC for rioting armed with deadly weapons.

Zanak’s wife Meena and her aide, Vandana Jais, too have been convicted under section 323 of the IPC for simple assault with an imprisonment of one month and fine Rs500.

Additional public prosecutor Nitin Telgote, who is also the government pleader, said there were 18 witnesses in the case who were examined during the trial. “A seven-year-old girl from the neighbourhood and Imrat’s wife Sunita were the prime witnesses who deposed before the court. These eyewitnesses proved to be the turning points in the case,” he said.

Telgote added that the case had plenty of evidence which led to the conviction.

The court also stated that the period of the life imprisonment would be adjusted against the span of time which the convicts have already spent in prison following the method of set-off under criminal procedure code (CrPC). The convicts were arrested by Jaripatka police immediately after the murder.

Vandana and Sunita had been asked by the court to surrender their bail bonds.

364,['26/02/2020'],"Vidarbha loan waiver bill may be over Rs 6,300 crore","This story is from February 26, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: As the exercise begins to implement loan waiver scheme of the MVA government, the initial data shows that defaults in Vidarbha may easily exceed Rs 6300 crore. This relates to over 9 lakh loan accounts that have turned NPAs.

The MVA waiver scheme, named after social reformer Jyotiba Phule, covers loans that have been granted between April 2015 and March 31, 2019, and are overdue as on September 30, 2019.

A compilation of figures from banks shows that farm loans to the tune of Rs5,520 crore have been defaulted in the six districts that have been declared as farm crisis hit. On account of high farmers’ suicides, the districts of Akola, Amravati , Yavatmal, Buldhana, Washim, and Wardha are under special watch and have the crisis-hit tag.

The number of defaults in terms of amount is highest in Buldhana which has even surpassed Yavatmal — the district that has otherwise topped farm crisis list. In Buldhana, over 1.98 lakh farmers’ accounts have turned NPAs for loans worth more than Rs1,412 crore. The number of accounts and farmers can vary because each farmer can have more than one farm account.

This is followed by Amravati where 1.39 lakh farmers’ accounts are under defaulters’ list for loans to the tune of Rs1,250 crore. Yavatmal ranks fourth in the list with 1.08 lakh farmers’ accounts and Rs754 crore of defaults.

Gadchiroli has the lowest number with defaults worth Rs81 crore from over 16,600 loan accounts. Nagpur, on the other hand, has 4,900 NPA accounts having loans to the tune of over Rs300 crore.

The numbers will vary as the amounts will have to be confirmed by the farmers. In case of a dispute, the case will be referred to a committee.

The first list from two villages from each district of the state was released on Monday. These villages have been taken on pilot basis. “If no hassles are found in the initial list, then work would start on a full-scale bass by this month end,” said sources.

The current waiver scheme covers loans till an upper limit of Rs2 lakh. The scheme, named after Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and launched during BJP-led government, had covered loans up to Rs1.50 lakh. For a higher amount, a one-time settlement (OTS) scheme was put in place. Under this, the farmer had to pay an additional amount and get a waiver for up to Rs1.5 lakh.

A number of farmers with loans more than Rs1.5 lakh could not avail of the OTS. Some of those farmers can now directly avail the new waiver scheme.

While the current scheme covers loans granted from April 2015 to March 2019, the earlier scheme covered loans from 2002 till March 2016 that have been overdue as on June 2017.

“The farmers who had availed loans from 2015 to 2019 but could not avail the OTS can now be directly covered under the fresh waiver plan if their loans are within Rs2 lakh,” said a source..

366,['26/02/2020'],Nagpur: Released convicts to soon get help setting up industries,"This story is from February 26, 2020

NAGPUR: In a small beginning towards rehabilitating convicts who have served their jail terms, the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Institute (MSME-DI), Nagpur, is planning a scheme to help such persons set up industries after being released from jails.

The MSME-DI, which comes under the Union ministry of MSMEs, has written to the director general (DG) prisons in the state to share data of inmates who have been released in last one year and are living in Nagpur and nearby places.

“Usually, it is very difficult for former prisoners to get back into the main stream after they complete the sentence. The stigma means they cannot get jobs, and they are also susceptible to commit crimes again due to that. Self-employment can be the best option in such cases,” said MM Parlewar, director of MSME-DI. This would be the first ever scheme from an industry related department purely for rehabilitation of former prisoners.

“The idea was conceived in Nagpur and simultaneously I have also registered for PhD research on the subject — rehabilitating inmates by helping them set up industries. There are plans to start the initiative in Nagpur as a pilot project. Once it succeeds, the model may be put forward for implementation in other parts of the country too,” said Parlewar.

Parlewar plans to put up the research thesis itself as a proposal document before the ministry for adopting the model elsewhere in the country once it succeeds in Nagpur.

MSME-DI will select potential candidates from lists provided by the prisons department. Initially, it may be a limited number of inmates, but that number would increase eventually, he said.

There are some prisoners who may have taken up work involving specific skills during the sentence. For them, the process can start immediately. Others would be imparted skill development training too, he said.

Funds may be arranged through banks or other government schemes. In case the promoter has to bring in some initial capital, there are plans to arrange it through sponsors, he said.

The idea is to begin with cottage industries for inmates, as it would not require much capital investment. Moreover, the skills acquired during the prison term can also be utilized in such industries, he said.

KOLLAM: The anti-terror squad ( ATS ) probing the incident involving the finding of Pakistan-made cartridges at Muppathadi bridge, Kulathupuzha, have questioned a Tamil Nadu-based Malayali poultry farm owner who is residing at Kulathupuzha on Tuesday.

The ATS team led by DIG Anoop Kuruvilla John interrogated the poultry farm owner in view of finding a Tamil Nadu state electricity board’s consumer bill from near the abandoned cartridges. The poultry farm owner told investigators that the bill might have fallen there when he came out of his vehicle to take a break. After a detailed interrogation, he was let go.

Police have collected several CCTV footages of the road where the bullets were found and several other places on the Thiruvananthapuram-Shenkottai road.

The TN Q branch is also investigating the incident in view of the murder of Wilson, a sub-inspector of TN police on the Kerala border near Kaliyikkavila by terror elements on January 9. The investigators have come to the conclusion that the cartridges must have been dropped at Muppathadi after February 4.

The investigating team has decided to collect information on ex-servicemen to ascertain whether they have links with terrorist organizations. The investigators held an evaluation meeting at Kulathupuzha. Senior officers who attended the meeting expressed confidence that they could zero in on the culprits soon.

Panaji: The state government has directed the department of settlement and land records (DSLR) to map all bunds and sluice gates across the state and furnish the details to the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) to prepare the draft coastal zone management plan (CZMP).

The environment department issued the direction to the DSLR, after the National Coastal Zone Management Authority (NCZMA) recently accepted the state government’s request to demarcate the high tide line (HTL) along bunds and not around mangroves in khazan lands for the coastal plan.

A senior officer said that though a time limit has not been set to complete the work, mapping of bunds will be done soon.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed NCSCM, the Chennai-based agency entrusted with drawing up the plan, to submit the final draft to the Union environment ministry by March 31 after a public hearing. It added that the final notification must be issued before April 30, an official said.

The senior officer said that the environment department has written to the agriculture department’s soil division and to the water resources department to support DSLR with maps and other documents required to map bunds and sluice gates. The officer said the suggestions made by village panchayats and municipalities have been forwarded to NCSCM, but as the government has convinced the NCZMA to demarcate the high tide line (HTL) along bunds, these suggestions become null and void.

As per official sources, the circuit bench will have jurisdiction on all appeals and application in the field of direct taxes from Uttarakhand.

City-based finance and taxation professionals welcomed the move of starting the bench. “The circuit bench will go a long way in helping litigants to settle their cases right here in the city instead of traveling far,” said Shishir Gupta, a city-based charted accountant.

Traders and businesspersons also termed the initiative as one which was long pending.

“The setting up of ITAT will help traders and also benefit the students of accountancy and finances as they will be able to get more job opportunities. People would not need to hire Delhi-based CAs anymore,” said Dinesh Semwal, a city-based trader.

DEHRADUN: The state health department confirmed eight swine flu cases on Tuesday. Among these cases, three patients are from the neighboring districts of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and the rest are from Haridwar and Dehradun districts in Uttarakhand.

Dr Pankaj Singh, who works in the office of director general (DG) health, told TOI that the state had sent 44 samples for diagnosis of swine flu to a laboratory in New Delhi. ""We have received the reports of 26 patients. Among these, eight patients were diagnosed with the disease. Five of them are from Uttarakhand and the other three are from UP. These cases were reported from January first week to February second week,"" he said while adding that an advisory for the hospitals was already sent by the DG health which includes formation of isolation wards and ensuring proper stock of medicines.

Talking about preventive measures to check the spread of the disease, Dr Singh said that people must cover their nose as the H1N1 virus spreads by droplet infection. “Swine flu is a form of influenza which is curable but the virus can prove fatal in case of diabetics, children and the elderly. We advise people to opt for early treatment and avoid contact with people when its symptoms are detected. One should immediately consult a doctor in case of consistent fever and breathlessness,” he added.

AGRA: Mobile Internet services remained suspended in Aligarh on second day running on Tuesday and parts of the city were manned by a large number of security personnel in the wake of Sunday’s clash, and violence in Delhi. Sunday night’s clashes between anti-CAA protesters and policemen had left eight injured.

Superintendent of police (crime) Arvind Kumar said, “Nine companies of PAC and four companies of RAF along with three additional SPs, eight deputy SPs and eight station house officers (SHO) of neighbouring districts have been deployed in the city as a precautionary measure.”

Internet services are shut in the city since Sunday night and will remain suspended till the situation improves. However, administrative officials said that it may be restored by Wednesday morning, if all goes well.

Nearly 2,000 women sat on ‘dharna’ in Aligarh’s Kawarsi bypass and blocked the traffic to protest against CAA and NRC on Tuesday. Anti-CAA protesters at Shahjamal, Jamalpur area and Chungi Gate of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) have already been protesting for the past many days.

The protesting women threatened to continue their protest till the CAA is withdrawn by the government.

In view of tense situation in the city, ADG (Agra zone) Ajay Anand is camping in the city. Anand told TOI that in view of the violent incidents in Delhi and Aligarh, he will be monitoring the situation and will hold a dialogue with leaders of both the communities to develop confidence and restore normalcy in the city.

“Miscreants are being identified and legal action will be taken against them. Besides, flag marches were conducted by police in the sensitive areas of the city. We will also dispel fear about CAA and educate them,” he added.

Most shops in the minority-dominated localities, including Upper Kot and Jiwangarh, remained closed on Tuesday. But, shops in other parts of the city reopened. Police have booked more than 350 people in connection with the arson and group clashes that took place in the city on Sunday evening.

FIRs were registered under various sections of IPC including section 153 A (Promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion), 307 (attempt to murder). About 100 people have been identified and 40 of them are named in the FIRs, said police.

DEHRADUN/NANITAL: Angry at the Char Dham Devsthanam Management Act that the state assembly recently passed and which gives control of around 50 temples including the four Char Dham shrines to the Uttarakhand government, priests of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri have warned pilgrims not to visit the holy sites as they “might witness something worse than the 2013 tragedy”. Seven years ago, massive floods had ravaged the hill state.

The priests' warning came during the annual practice of Char Dham priests travelling across the country to visit devotees when portals of the temples are closed during winter.

The priests have alleged that the state government is playing with people’s faith. On Tuesday, Shiv Prakash, chief priest (rawal) of the Gangotri temple in Uttarkashi , told TOI, “By taking over the temples through this law, the state government is playing with religion and people’s faith. If they don’t quash the law, something worse than the 2013 floods will happen.” He has already visited Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Delhi to persuade people to not visit Char Dham shrines this year in protest against the shrine board law. He will be travelling to Assam next.

Rajesh Semwal, another priest from the Gangotri shrine, told TOI that if the state government doesn’t retract the law, the priests will boycott temple rituals this year and pilgrims won’t be able to offer prayers. “If the priests boycott rituals, the yatra of pilgrims will remain incomplete,” he said, adding that the government’s move doesn’t send a positive message to pilgrims.

This came even as senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy moved the Uttarakhand high court on Tuesday against the newly passed Act. Following this, the HC has given the state government three weeks’ time to respond to Swamy’s PIL.

“The division bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma heard arguments from both sides and directed the government to file their responses within three weeks,” Swamy said. He also demanded that the court put a stay on the Act.

Lawyers appearing for the government, including advocate general SN Babulkar and chief standing counsel Paresh Tripathi, have defended the Act and said it has been passed following the country’s Constitution and that the petition is based on a ""political stunt"" and therefore should be quashed.

The Char Dham Yatra this year will start from the last week of April with the portals of Gangotri and Yamunotri opening on April 26, followed by those of Kedarnath and Badrinath subsequently.

NEW DELHI: While the India-US joint statement seemed to carry an abridged version of the condemnation of cross-border terrorism when the leaders met in 2017, it was unequivocal in condemning the menace as PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump denounced any use of terrorist proxies and called on Pakistan to ensure no territory under its control is used to launch terror attacks.While the statement slammed “cross-border terrorism’’ in all its forms and also named terror groups like Jaish-e- Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Toiba supported by Pakistan against India, it also noted concerns regarding China. India and the US spoke of efforts towards a meaningful Code of Conduct in the South China Sea and “solemnly urged that it not prejudice the legitimate rights and interests of all nations according to international law’’.Soon after Modi assumed office in 2014, after his first summit with then president Barack Obama, India for the first time mentioned the South China Sea dispute in a bilateral document with the US. This happened again after Obama’s visit to India in early 2015. In 2017 though, the countries dropped the mention even though they reiterated the importance of respecting freedom of navigation, overflight and commerce throughout the region.The joint statement called on Pakistan to ensure that no territory under its control is used to launch terrorist attacks and to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of such attacks, including 26/11 and Pathankot. It also called for concerted action against all terrorist groups including al-Qaida, IS, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Lashkar-e-Toiba, Hizb-ul Mujahideen, the Haqqani Network , TTP, D-Company and all their affiliates.This is significant for India as it has sought similar condemnation from all world leaders, particularly the mention of cross-border terrorism, after high-level talks.

He also added that his country enjoyed a very good relationship with Pakistan.Unlike last time though, the leaders did not affirm their support for a UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that, as they said in 2017, will advance and strengthen the framework for global cooperation and reinforce the message that no cause or grievance justifies terrorism.Also missing was the pledge as was done last time to work together to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems and to deny access to such weapons to terrorists and non-state actors.In his speech at the Hyderabad House, where he hosted Trump, Modi said cooperation between India and the US at the global level was founded on democratic values and objectives, especially in the Indo-Pacific region and other global commons. In a dig at China, he also said India and the US agreed on the importance of “sustainable and transparent financing’’ in the development of connectivity infrastructure across the world.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74309912,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-297320,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stern-line-on-islamabad-ensure-no-terror-activity-in-territory/articleshow/74309908.cms

Agra: Just two days after deputy CM Dinesh Sharma, who also holds the education portfolio, had visited Firozabad and claimed that UP is now free from rigged board examination, six impersonators were caught on Tuesday while writing the mathematics paper.

Ritu Goyal, district inspector of school, said, “The invigilators appointed for the board examination have been given clear instructions to verify the admit card with available photo and Aadhaar card of the student. If there is any discrepancy, the student won’t be allowed to write the examination. The impersonators caught have to be booked and handed over to the police.”

Picture used for representational purpose only

GHAZIABAD: Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) plans to install double power meters for 15,000 small factories across Ghaziabad in an attempt to track irregularities.

Apart from the existing meter, another one would be installed at an electric pole where a factory’s supply feeder is set up. The readings of both would be tallied every month. An agency has been hired to monitor the meters.

PVVNL chief engineer Rakesh Kumar said: “We’ve implemented the system in 5,000 factories having load of over 25 kW. Now, we’re going to focus on 15,000 factories with load between 10 and 25 kW.” He said the step was taken after several cases of power theft came. “Detecting thefts manually or through surprise raids is a cumbersome process. So, the scheme of double metering has been introduced,” he said.

Aligarh Muslim University (File Photo)

AGRA: Complying with Allahabad high court directive, the ADG ( Agra zone) held a meeting of senior police officers in Aligarh on Tuesday and started the process of identifying the policemen who had allegedly smashed motorcycles and caned apprehended students on Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) campus on the night of December 15 last year.

Talking with TOI, ADG (Agra zone) Ajay Anand said a meeting of senior officials in Aligarh, including DIG and SSP, was conducted on Tuesday to decide on action to be taken against policemen involved in campus violence.

Welcoming the court’s directions, AMU students said finally it has been proved that students were subjected to brutal violence. The court directed the UP government to compensate students.

“It is time for police to accept the responsibility and take stringent action against those policemen who brutalized AMU students,” said Salman Imtiaz, former president of the AMU Students’ Union. He said, now, UP Police and RAF officers must be taken to task in accordance with the law.

“The court’s directive has proved that UP police behaved in an unprofessional manner and must be trained for good policing. It is now clear that police have abused the law, therefore all charges against AMU students in multiple farcical FIRs must be immediately withdrawn,” said Imtiaz.

The former student leader said the court’s verdict has exposed the lies of UP chief minister who recently accused students of violence on the campus. He alleged, “It was not students but the Yogi’s forces who vandalized the properties and injured innocent students. His statement in the assembly must be expunged from the records and he must apologize for misleading the nation and lying from a constitutional post.”

Demanding the resignations of AMU vice-chancellor and registrar, the students, who are protesting against CAA/NRC/NPR on the campus, said they two should take responsibility and quit immediately. They said they would intensify their stir in case the two did not resign on their own.

AMU spokesperson Rahat Abrar said the varsity welcomes the court’s order and added all evidence, including CCTV footage, will be provided to the high court and the compliance report will be submitted in the court.

A day earlier, the court had directed all concerned to adhere to the recommendations of the National Human Right Commission (NHRC). On January 8, 2020, the high court had asked NHRC to conduct an inquiry into the matter. Thereafter, a six-member team conducted a probe and the commission accepted the report. Later, a copy of the report was sent to the high court.

The bench asked the NHRC to ensure that its recommendations were followed by the Uttar Pradesh and central governments. The high court has sought a compliance report and listed the the next hearing on March 25.

He said the complainant contacted the customer care number of the website the next day as he did not get the delivery of the free pair of shoes. “The caller told the complainant that the latter had to transfer Rs10 from his Unified Payments Interface (UPI) application to receive the free shoes . The person on the other end of the call sent him a link to transfer the amount,” the officer said.

He said the complainant filled up his UPI details on the link and even provided his PIN. “Rs61,330 was immediately debited from two of the complainant’s bank accounts. Both the accounts were linked to his UPI,” the officer said.

According to police, Orthopedician Dr Nirvikalp Agarwal was allegedly abducted by a group of four persons on December 10 and was released after a ransom amount of Rs 52 lakh was given to them. On January 19, Agarwal again received a call by the abductors demanding another Rs 50 lakh.

Agarwal, who had initially refused to lodge a complaint, called the police and informed them about the extortion call. Highway police worked out the case and nabbed one of the abductors from Meerut. They also recovered of Rs 15 lakh from him which they reportedly handed over to the doctor.

However, police released the abductor after three days of detention without showing his arrest or registering an FIR. Senior officials inquired the matter and during the course of inquiry, action was taken against the cops who allowed the kidnapper to go scot-free.

MEERUT: At least six men allegedly thrashed a college student brutally, leaving him with a fractured arm and dislocated fingers after he refused to pay extortion money to them. The alleged incident took place in Hapur about 10 days ago, and was brought to the fore due a video recorded by the accused.

Police on Tuesday filed an FIR and booked the accused for attempt to murder. The youth , Lucky, 20 , has now threatened suicide if “police doesn’t take swift action against attackers”.

“These goons used to demand money from me. When I refused, they kidnapped me while I was returning from college. They took me to a secluded field and brutally attacked me with rods. I am now left with a fractured arm, leg and dislocated finger bones. I don’t know for how long I was lying unconscious there. I was saved when a passerby spotted me and informed my relatives. Now I have filed a police complaint. If police does not act against my tormentors, I will commit suicide,” he said.

The video, made by one of the attackers, purportedly shows the brutality of the attackers as they thrashed the youth, who lay half naked in the field.

Additional superintendent of police (ASP) of Hapur Sarvesh Mishra said, “We have filed FIR under IPC section 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (unlawful assembly). Efforts are on to arrest the culprits.”

Flag march was carried out in several sensitive cities of Uttar Pradesh

AGRA: Leaves of all policemen were cancelled and flag march was carried out in several sensitive cities of Uttar Pradesh as the state government tried to pre-empt any attempt to disturb peace after parts of neighbouring Delhi erupted in violence leaving at least 13 dead.

Aligarh, which witnessed clashes on Sunday leaving at least 10 injured, was virtually turned into a fortress with the deployment of 13 companies of RAF and PAC. In Meerut zone’s Hapur district, the administration invoked section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), barring assembly of five or more persons.

In Bareilly, additional director general of police (ADG) Avinash Chandra went a step further and warned of use of force against unauthorised protests. “I will not let the mistake of Delhi be repeated in the UP,” the police officer warned.

Sachindra Patel, superintendent of police (SP) of Firozabad, conducted a flag march with heavy police force in sensitive parts of the district.

“After violence in the national capital, we are on high alert. The district is divided into several zones and sectors. We are carrying out flag march in sensitive parts to send a message to locals that, at no cost, peace will be allowed to be compromised. Police presence is clear warning to anti-social elements,” SP Patel said.

Police are also keeping a close eye on social media platforms. Cyber cells of every district are scanning social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp groups.

“Any post which can trigger violence will be removed immediately and action will be taken against person sharing provocative content,” added SP Firozabad.

In December last year, at least seven residents of Firozabad were killed in violence which occurred during anti-CAA protest. Most of the victims died of bullet wounds. Police maintained that not a single bullet was fired by them.

Like Firozabad, flag marches by the security personnel were carried out in Bulandshahr, Sambhal and Baghpat also.

IG of Agra range, Satish Ganesh, who was on leave after overseeing security during US President Donal Trump’s visit to city, was asked to join immediately. ADG of Agra zone, Ajay Anand said, “DGP has asked everyone to remain alert at highest level.”

ADG of Bareilly zone, Chandra held a meeting with senior policemen. During the meeting, he said, “Any protest without permission will be dealt with immediate baton-charge. Rubber bullets and tear gas could be used if required.”

The ADG further said that he won’t let “mistake like Delhi to be repeated in the state and anybody trying to stage protest inside a police station will straightaway be charged by police.”

Chandra told TOI, “I would like send a message to the protesters. Irrespective of their religion, there will be zero tolerance for unapproved protests and especially people entering the police station for staging protest like Delhi. Police will welcome them with batons.”

After intelligence inputs from security agencies, home department has instructed ADGP-rank officials to stay in sensitive area like Rampur, Moradabad, Bijnor and Sambhal and keep a close eye on law and order situation. According to sources, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath is monitoring the situation and is in continuous contact with the ADGP-ranked officials across the state.

The water level of the dam needs to come down to resume the work halted since a year

KOLHAPUR: The water resources department (WRD) on Tuesday claimed that water level at the site of jack-well and pumping station in Kalammawadi dam will recede in the first week of March.

The area has been under water from last monsoon. The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC), through a private contractor, is carrying out the work of the jack-well to bring in the dam water to the pumping station. The total cost of the project is around Rs 488 crore and it was supposed to be completed two years ago.

MLA Chandrakant Jadhav met WRD minister Jayant Patil on Monday and demanded to direct the divisional office of the WRD to release water from the dam to get the site cleared for resuming the construction work.

A WRD official claimed that they are releasing water at the rate of 1,300 cusec whenever there is demand from the farmers. The farmers also have their electric pumps along the banks of the river from where the water is pumped for irrigation.

Rohit Bandivdekar, executive engineer of WRD, said, “Based on demand, water is released from Kalammawadi and Radhanagari dams. We have to ensure that adequate water level is maintained in the dams for supply during season. We expect that the water level at the site where the works of pipeline project has been stalled will reduce by the first week of March.”

Currently, the water level at Kalammawadi dam is at 639.75 feet. A civic official said that water level needs to be reduced further by 10 feet. “When the work resumes the contractor will get just three months to complete the work which is impossible with the current strength of the workers,” he said.

A senior KMC official said, “Most of the works related to laying the pipelines and setting up of water treatment plant have been completed. We have asked the contractor to increase the number of workers to complete the work at the dam site in the three months that we have. Once the monsoon arrives, it will be not possible to carry out the work.”

Nashik: The Poultry Farmers and Breeders Association (PFBA) has said that the poultry and egg business in Maharashtra has witnessed a Rs 600-crore loss in the past one month due to panic among consumers sparked by misinformation on social media about the coronavirus.

Uddhav Ahire, a senior office-bearer of PFBA, on Monday claimed that the poultry and egg industry in the state had incurred heavy losses due to fear-mongering on social media. “Misinformation has gone viral and the poultry and egg businesses have been badly hit since the outbreak,” said Uddhav Ahire.

The annual turnover of the poultry industry in Maharashtra is estimated to be around Rs 14,000 crore. Of which, the annual turnover of the poultry industry in Nashik district alone is Rs 2,000 crore. But the industry has been badly affected in the past month.

In a bid to create awareness and remove false information, the association has organised a two-day chicken festival in Nashik, beginning from Tuesday. The festival is to be held at Dongre Hostel grounds, along the Gangapur Road, between 4 pm and 10 pm.

Various dishes like chicken biryani, boiled eggs and other delicacies are will be available at 50 stalls at marginal rates, said Ahire. The association has appealed to the people to visit and taste various dishes at the chicken festival.

390,['26/02/2020'],"16 years on, 250 flat owners in Vyankatesh Nagar await mutation","This story is from February 26, 2020

Nagpur: Over 250 flats owners in Vyankatesh Nagar, one of the biggest residential colonies in East Nagpur, are running from pillar to post for mutation of their flats in City Survey records despite no fault of theirs.

According to secretary of Vyankatesh Nagar Owners Association Suraj Singh Thakur, who is also BJP city vice-president, “Over 250 families are facing several hardships because of “irregularities” by the developer and red-tapism on part of concerned government departments.”

Thakur said the state government had acquired over 38 acres land in Nandanwan under ULC Act, but the same as returned to land owners under Talegaon Dabhade scheme. A developer decided to construct a housing scheme there with 26 towers comprising 416 flats and 110 twin-house bungalows in 2003 on the basis of power of attorney from all 29 land owners.

The Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) sanctioned layout and building plan of the scheme in 2003. Several citizens booked flats/ bungalows after verifying the sanctioned plan and inked agreement to sale with the developer which was duly registered with the registrar’s office. Most of the flat buyers availed home loan from banks, which verified the documents through their surveyors and legal experts before sanctioning the amount. The buyers were handed over the possession by 2004.

In the meanwhile, the land was brought under the Nagpur Municipal Corporation jurisdiction, which sanctioned the revised plan in 2006.

By 2009, nearly 50% of the buyers got their sale deeds executed followed by mutation. After some delay, sale deed of the remaining properties were also executed.

However, in 2017, one of the land owners lodged a complaint with the authorities alleging forgery in power of attorney documents. Following the complaint, City Survey department refused to execute mutations citing the objection from one of land owners.

In March 2017, crime branch’s special investigation team (SIT) registered a case against the developer on charges of forgery.

“The NIT or NMC are duty-bound to verify each and every document before sanctioning a layout and building plan,” said Thakur, who is also one of the aggrieved buyers. “The buyers are unnecessarily facing the brunt of the “misdeeds” of a developer and government departments,” he alleged.

As the mutation proceedings were halted, aggrieved buyers approached revenue minister in Devendra Fadnavis cabinet Chandrakant Patil in August 2018 and apprised him of their plight. Accordingly, state’s revenue department on September 25, 2018, directed collector’s office to investigate the matter and submit a report. However, the collector’s office has not submitted the report even after 17 months.

As nothing has moved since then, over 250 buyers are unable to mortgage the property for availing loan nor they are able to sell it in the absence of mutation. They, however, have to repay the home loan and also pay property tax to the civic body.

Superintendent of land records GB Daberao, under whom the City Survey offices comes, told TOI that he was not aware of the case. “I will go through the details and do the needful,” he said.

Collector Ravindra Thakre did not respond to TOI’s call and message.

MEERUT: Piyush Vashist, the 29-year-old who boarded the coronavirus-infected Diamond Princess cruise on January 25, will finally be returning to India in a chartered flight arranged by the Indian government to bring back all the Indians on board on Wednesday.Vashist along with other Indians on board have been given instructions to wear a mask all the time so as to prevent any spread of the infection. They will then be kept at the coronavirus health facility in Haryana’s Manesar for a 14-day quarantine period and then would be allowed to go home.Piyush’s family is ecstatic and awaits his safe and quick return.“This was an extraordinary situation.

NAGPUR: The coronavirus outbreak in China has delayed Nagpur Municipal Corporation ’s ( NMC ) plan to install seven full-bore electromagnetic flow meters on the pipeline bringing raw drinking water from Pench dam to the city in February. Now, the civic body is purchasing the meters from Aurangabad , but they can be installed only by May. The procedure will require shut down of water supply for a few days for 70% areas of the city in peak summer time, when water demand is huge.Chairman of NMC water works consultative committee Vijay Zalke told TOI all efforts will be taken to minimize the impact in May. NMC had issued work order to a private company for purchase and installation of flow meters last year. The contractor placed the order with a China-based company. But the meters will not be available this month since the company cited disruptions due to coronavirus.“Now, the contractor has placed order with a company in Aurangabad. We have given a deadline of May. Earlier, we have taken shut down in May for crucial works. We will take shut down of 1-2 days in intervals to minimize the impact,” he said.To put an end to carriage of raw water through open canals, NMC had laid 31km giant-sized pipeline of 2,300mm diameter between Pench dam and Mahadula pumping station in 2015. Leakages were noticed in the pipeline due to some natural causes and also due to sabotage by unidentified persons. Over 30 million litres per day (MLD) water, sufficient for around two lakh people, was going waste for over one year due to the leaks.NMC repaired some leaks on temporary basis and reduced loss. Also, it planned to shut water supply from pipeline and bring water through canal. During shut down, NMC planned repairs of leaks and installation of flow meters. NMC will then be able to know exact point and cause of leakage.All this activity was planned in July last year. There would have been no effect to people had works been completed in the winter, as water demand is low. But NMC delayed the works for various reasons.NMC was confident of executing the works in February, which is pre-summer days. Now, people will have to suffer due to NMC’s delays. The demand for water is high during summer, especially in May. Also, NMC cannot bring water through open canal in May as losses will be high and there are chances of breach in canal.Zalke said works to repair leaks on the pipeline have started. “NMC took shut down for two days on February 13 and 14 for electric work. On these two days, some leaks were repaired. Remaining leaks will be repaired with shut down on March 1 and some more days,” he said.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74317602,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110634,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coronavirus-effect-pipeline-works-delayed-to-peak-summer/articleshow/74308639.cms

<p>Traders further claimed that they were being harassed by the employees of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation<br... Read More

KOLHAPUR: The apex body of traders— Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI)—has alleged that the civic administration’s implementation of the plastic ban was not in line with the law passed by the state government.

Traders further claimed that they were being harassed by the employees of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation ’s (KMC) health department, who were seizing their plastic stock and imposing fines without making them about the rules of the blanket plastic ban.

President of KCCI Sanjay Shete said, “The KMC has slapped a fine of Rs 5,000 each on 190 traders in the last couple of months. Many still do not know the rules of the ban and which types of plastic are exempted. We have received complaints from 40 traders who alleged that they were fined despite using the plastic type exempted by law.”

Shete further said that action had also been taken against bakery shops. “The bakery products cannot be stored in the open for long. They have to be packed in plastic material. Small vendors of industry suppliers and cloth merchants are also fined despite the name of the manufacturer and the buy-back message being printed on the plastic material. KMC is implementing the plastic ban without considering the practical constraints of the traders. We are going to protest in the next few days if they dont stop taking unnecesary action.”

He added that the civic body should hold programmes for the traders and small vendors to make them aware of the types of plastic banned and exempted under law. The KCCI has recently demanded that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) act against the suppliers of plastic carry bags and packaging materials supplied from Gandhinagar market town. However, no action has not been taken so far.

Officials from the civic administration said that plastic material with size less than 50 micron were totally banned and that a few types more than 50 microns in size were not permitted.

KMC’s chief health officer Dilip Patil said that although they have taken a note of the concerns of the traders, the action against those hoarding plastic for packaging could not stop as the civic body had pledged to make the city free by March 31.

“Some of the plastic material used for packaging the food grains and bakery products are exempted. We have provided a list of the plastic material allowed and exempted. As far as action against suppliers is concerned, traders must ensure that they do not buy the plastic carry bags from them,” said Patil. He refuted the claim that owners of bakery shops had been fined.

DEHRADUN: The former students of Shivanand Saraswati , chief of Matri Sadan , are up in arms against Haridwar district adminstration and police for removing his and ashram’s security cover. Seer Saraswati was earlier a chemistry teacher at an intermediate college in Kolkata.

On February 19th, Saraswati’s security cover which included two gunners was withdrawn by Haridwar SSP . This angered the seers of Matri Sadan. Now, students from various parts of country are reaching Matri Sadan to oppose the move.

On Tuesday, one of his students interacted with media persons and urged the state government to reinstate the security cover of Matri Sadan and its head. “We are all former students of Shivanand Saraswati. So far, we haven’t joined protest for clean Ganga but now, his security has been removed. We all urge you to kindly help him get back the security cover so that he is safe from mining mafias,” said Yogendera Singh, one of his former students from Uttar Pradesh, who is currently at Matri Sadan.

Notably, Haridwar SSP Senthil Avoodai K Raj has already told the seers to approach the state government for security cover as their duration to avail the privilege was exhausted long back.

Meanwhile, seers Padmavati and Aatmabodhanand are undergoing treatment in AIIMS-Delhi. Padamavati has been kept on ventilator and Aatmabodhanand is being given intravenous fluid.

KOLHAPUR: Civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti on Tuesday issued a show-cause notice to system manager Yashpal Rajput for finding several technical glitches in the system of citizen felicitation centre (CFC) at Tarani Market.

The CFC’s are meant for the citizens to pay taxes and avail various other civic services. The systems department handles the digital network of the CFC’s.

Kalshetti on Tuesday visited the Tararani Market CFC and found that the system was down due to several technical glitches and power supply issues. Unhappy with the developments, the civic chief gave a show-cause notice which read, “There is no back-up mechanism functioning at the CFC. In the case of a power cut, the data of the citizens may be lost and further pose a challenge in accounting. Since such things amount to negligence, I prescribe a fine of Rs 2000 which you have to pay if I did not get the reply to the show-cause notice within three days.”

Kalshetti stated in the notice that the system manager position holds importance as the e-governance system is operated through the respective department.

Every day, the staff has to ensure that the tax collection system applied for various civic services through the digital systems run efficiently. Kalshetti said that he observed that the battery back-up system located at another CFC located at Gandhi Maidan ward office is also not functioning properly and the required repair works have not been taken for the last some days. “The dire negligence towards the systems has been reported prima facie. The negligence amounts to a violation of service rules,” stated the notice.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The special committee, under local self-government department ( LSGD ), has recommended renewal of permits beyond 10 years for a few commercial and residential highrises in state disregarding the grave violations reported against these constructions.

A meeting of the committee was chaired by former additional chief secretary (LSGD) T K Jose on February 12, the day cabinet decided to shift him.

Sources confirmed that officials were forced to prepare a draft of the minutes of the meeting, clearing the buildings for renewal of permits, that night itself. On February 14, the government issued an order transferring Jose to PWD . The minutes of the meeting carry the signature of additional chief secretary dated February 17.

It is also learnt that the agenda for the meeting was revised to insert an item regarding extension of permit of a building, reportedly at the behest of another top official. The five-member committee, which includes LSGD principal secretary, director of urban affairs, chief town planner, district officer of town planning department and secretary of civic body concerned, considered applications for renewal of permits beyond 10 years. The secretary of a civic body grants extension for a period less than 10 years.

The minutes of the meeting showed that a commercial-cum-residential building (7,471.24 sq m) in Kozhikode corporation, a residential flat (3,832.75 sq m) in Tripunithura municipality, a residential-cum-apartment building in Thrikkakara municipality (1,21,049.18 sq m), a commercial building (869.54 sq m) in Perumbavoor municipality and a special residential and commercial building in Irinjalakuda municipality (3,373.17 sq m) were cleared for renewal of permits. This was cleared though district town planner and chief town planner enlisted major violations from approved plan for each construction. The rule says that any deviation from approved permit should lead to revocation of permit, following a hearing process.

For the building in Thrikkakara, senior town planner recommended against extension of building permit, citing rule violations regarding access, height, environmental clearance and violation of Kochi structure plan. The chief town planner remarked that NOC issued to the building was regularized in 2015 despite major rule and scheme violations and it was a major fault by the officials concerned. The government was also ordered to stop construction activities and to take action after investigation by LSGD (vigilance wing).

The minutes also showed that the construction was not even permissible as the site came under agriculture zone as per the structure plan for the city. Despite these remarks, LSG recommended renewal of permit, forcing the committee to recommend extension of permit for two years for two towers and the municipality was asked to issue permit extension immediately.

Jose did not respond to request for comment via call and message. The officials with town planning department refused to comment on the decisions.

KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) will undertake the leakage repair work on a major pipeline at Aptenagar pumping station passing along Phulewadi Ring Road on Wednesday owing to which ward A of the city will not receive water for a day.

According to a civic official, the supply will resume on Thursday but at low pressure. The pipeline pumps water into elevated tank located at Aptenagar from where the water is supplied to Phulewadi, Saneguruji Vasahat, Rajopadhyenagar, Kanerkar Nagar, Krantisinha Nana Patil Nagar, Tuljabhavani Colony, Cursher Chowk, Devkar Panand, nearby suburbs and rural fringe areas.

Ramdas Gaikwad, deputy hydraulic engineer of KMC, said, “Water loss is taking place through the main pipeline and elevated tank is not getting filled to its adequate capacity. Citizens are reporting inadequate water supply and at low pressure. Hence, we expect to complete the work on Wednesday, but it may take few more hours for tests and filling up the tank. Supply to affected areas will resume from Thursday afternoon onwards.”

He added that water tankers will be deployed to cater to the demand of the colonies and housing societies. “The pipeline passing along Phulewadi ring road has several leakages — both minor and major.

KOLHAPUR: The regional transport office (RTO) took action against two motorcycle dealers in the city for violating rules.

According to RTO officials, the dealers were selling motorcycles without registering the vehicles with the RTO. Also, the dealers sold the vehicles without helmets. According to Supreme Court, it is mandatory for dealers to provide two helmets to the customers along with new motorcycles.

Taking action against the dealers, the RTO suspended their trade certificates.

S T Alwaris, RTO, Kolhapur division, said, “In one case, the dealer had submitted an affidavit of a motorcycle buyer to the RTO in which the customer had mentioned that he already possessed two helmets which he use while riding the new motorcycle. When we enquired with the motorcycle owner, he told us that he has not submitted any affidavit and that there was discrepancy in his signature on the affidavit. We, therefore, sent a notice to the concerned dealer and suspended his trade certificate.”

“In another incident, we received a complaint from a vehicle owner stating that the dealer gave him all the documents after purchasing the vehicle, but failed to register it with the RTO. Based on this, we checked all the documents submitted by the complainant and found that the dealer had not applied for the said vehicle’s registration . This was in violation with our rule and, therefore, we suspended the concerned dealer’s trade certificate,” he said.

Alwaris said that as per the directives of Supreme Court, it is mandatory for any motorcycle dealer to provide two helmets to the customer while selling the vehicle. “We have issued instructions to the dealers from time to time to follow these norms and had warned them of action if they fail to abide by the rules,” he said.

“We have already initiated action against two traders and are checking documents to verify that other dealers are following all rules. We will intensify our drive against such defaulters,” he added.

LUCKNOW: Revellers hoping to buy Chinese water guns for Holi may be in for acute disappointment. Most city markets are left with limited stock of fun accessories for the festival, courtesy the novel coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak that has its epicentre in Wuhan, China.Not just the Holi market, the toy and electronics industries are facing a crunch situation too owing to strict curbs on imports from China, as Covid-19 (the disease caused by the virus) has claimed more than 2,000 lives in that country.Pawan Manocha, the president of Lucknow Traders’ Association, warned that shortage of new products was expected to push up prices of existing stock by 30-40% compared to 2019. “Every year, the Chinese market remains shut for a month on the account of New Year’s celebrations.

405,['26/02/2020'],Maharashtra: Auction notice issued to owner regularly paying property tax,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: The functioning of Mangalwari zone’s assistant municipal commissioner Harish Raut has once again come under scanner. This time, for issuing auction notice to a property owner who has been regularly paying property tax for an open plot in Zingabai Takli .

Senior Shiv Sena corporator Kishore Kumeriya said that apart from the affected resident, Vasantrao Gotmare, he too has submitted a written complaint to municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe and demanded an inquiry into the matter.

Gotmare, who stays in east Nagpur, owns a 216 sq m plot in front of Mankapur police station in Zingabai Takli. “Since purchase of the plot, I have never defaulted on property tax,” claimed 80-year-old and retired ZP official Gotmare.

For the current fiscal, Gotmare paid the property tax on May 30, 2019 itself and despite this, on December 12, the Mangalwari zone’s assistant municipal commissioner Harish Raut through an advertisement published Gotmare’s name along with other property owners’ names to auction their properties for defaulting NMC’s property tax. The advertisement shows that Gotmare has defaulted tax to the tune of Rs1.47 lakh. The advertisement also had some errors in Gotmare’s address.

Actually, it was not for the first time that the zone had carried out blunder. In November 2017 Raut did the same mistake.

Raut was not available for comments, while deputy municipal commissioner Mahesh Moroney assured to look into the matter.

Bihar deputy CM and finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi on way to present the state budget 2020-21 at Bihar Ass... Read More

PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi presented a revenue-surplus state budget of Rs 2,11,761 crore for the 2020-21 fiscal in the assembly with a fiscal deficit of Rs 20,374 crore. It was the last budget of the Nitish Kumar government’s 2015-20 term ahead of the assembly elections to be held later this year.

With no new schemes announced, the budget estimate for the 2020-21 fiscal is Rs 11,260.48 crore more than the previous budget that was slightly over Rs 2 lakh crore. While revenue surplus worth Rs 19,172.80 crore is 2.80% of the estimated gross state domestic product (GSDP) at Rs 6,85,797 crore for the 2020-21 fiscal, the fiscal deficit is 2.97% of the same.

In an interaction later, Modi clarified that no new schemes were announced as a lot of ambitious schemes such as the five-year Jal Jeevan Hariyali campaign worth Rs 24,500 crore had already come into force since October last year, apart from the Rs 10 lakh loan scheme with the provision of subsidy payment to those among the extremely backward castes (EBCs) who wanted to start business or trade activity.

“The Jal Jeevan Hariyali campaign is the first of its kind in the country. For another first, the state government would table the budget on environmental conservation called Green Budget next month, along with the separate gender and child budgets,” Modi said.

Otherwise, of the Rs 2.11 lakh crore worth of proposed budgeted expenditure during the 2020-21 fiscal, Rs 1,05,766.35 crore is for the scheme (or plan) expenditure, and the remaining Rs 1,05,995.14 crore for the non-plan expenditure to be spent on meeting the establishment costs, salary, pension, interest payment and repayment of public debt.

The budget envisages total receipts of Rs 2,11,961 crore, with Rs 1.83,923 crore coming as revenue receipts, and another chunk of capital receipts worth Rs 28,037.50 crore. The revenue receipts incorporate receipts from the Centre by way of state’s share in the divisible pool of central taxes to the tune of Rs 91,180.60 crore and grants-in-aid worth Rs 52,754.10 crore.

To add to the revenue receipts, Rs 39,989.28 crore would come from the state’s own tax revenue worth Rs 34,750 crore and the non-tax revenue of Rs 5,239.28 crore coming from Jharkhand against pension share liabilities, mines, interest receipts, irrigation and other non-taxes. For capital receipts, the government would raise Rs 27,609.27 crore through borrowings and another chunk of Rs 428.23 crore would come by way of recoveries of loans.

The capital expenditure is Rs 47,010.30 crore -- that is, Rs 1,739.94 crore more than Rs 45,270.36 crore pertaining to the 2019-20 financial year.

Modi said on the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission, the state’s share is 10.061% of the divisible pool of central taxes. While the estimate regarding the state’s receipt from the central pool of taxes fell to Rs 63,406.33 crore due to fall in the Centre’s tax receipts during 2019-20, the estimate of the state’s receipt from the same pool is Rs 91,180 crore during 2020-21.

Modi also said Bihar has suffered for abiding by the norms of Fiscal Responsibility and Business management (FRBM) Act, by which the fiscal deficit is kept at 3% of the GSDP. In contrast, the 15th Finance Commission has recommended payment of Rs 74,340 crore to the nine states as revenue deficit grant.

Belagavi: NRC and CAA is a conspiracy hatched by the BJP to get Hindu votes, said CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury here on Tuesday.

He said the CPM will conduct door to door campaigns across the nation from March 1 to 23.

“We oppose the NRC and CAA as they are harmful to our Constitution. He said the citizenship law will continue to face opposition. Other Left-wing parties too will participate in the awareness campaign against NRC and CAA,” he said.

He said that they will tell people to answer questions on census bit not those rewlated to NRC and CAA.

NRC and CAA is a threat to Dalits,and Adivasis, he claimed.

He held the Centre responsible for the violence that has erupted in Delhi over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and appealed to all to maintain peace.

Yechury said US President Donald Trump's visit will not benefit India, but is aimed at boosting the American economy.

He has come to boost his economy and not ours. So I do not see any benefit to our country.. The US President is coming to draw concessions for US farmers,” he added.

HUBBALLI: Fearmongering on social media about spread of coronavirus from chickens had led to a 60% drop in sales and nearly halved prices, sellers said, while poultry farmers don’t know what to do with the piling stock.“A video about the spread of coronavirus from chicken went viral on Whatsapp and sales which used to peak in the weekends has dropped for a month now,” said Faizal Khan, who owns a shop in Keshwapur. “Many are believing rumours that chicken is the main reason for spread of COVID-19 . Nobody wants to take a chance.”Fake photos and videos are being circulated online, erroneously claiming that the virus passes from chickens to humans. The government stepped in to quell the rumours and clarify that chicken was safe for consumption but to no avail.Hubballi has more than 15 dealers who own poultry farms and nearly 300 chicken shops in the city alone. During winter, a kilo of chicken sold for Rs 220 while it has fallen to Rs 150-180 now. In the wholesale market, chicken prices have halved – from Rs 80-90 per kilo to Rs 45-60.“We are trying to convince people but those who used to buy a kilo are buying half a kilo at best. All sellers are reporting about a 60% fall in sales,” said Asif Khatib of AS Poultry.“I used to buy more than 3kg of chicken on Sundays but now, family members are scared of the coronavirus outbreak and reluctant to eat chicken,” said Rayan D'Souza, a businessman in Keshwapur.“Although prices will fall with demand, farmers cannot keep the bird for more than 40 days. They cannot keep feeding the birds and it will become a huge burden. Farmers are selling, even at a loss, to prevent the stock from piling up,” said Khatib.Sellers recalled that they faced a similar crisis during the H1N1 more than a decade ago but it’s worse this time due to the fearmongering on social media. “H1N1 pushed poultry into trouble.

410,['26/02/2020'],"Govt ‘no’ to pubs, micro-breweries","This story is from February 26, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The government has cleared the excise policy for the upcoming financial year, taking a cautious approach without giving any room for criticism. The policy does not have any new announcements including micro-breweries or pubs , that have been the demands from the tourism and IT sectors.

Instead, the government focused on minor increase of licence fees for the bar hotels, clubs and distilleries, that will only fetch a meagre Rs 5 crore additionally to the state exchequer. The existing fee for bar hotel licence (FL-3 licence) has been increased from Rs 28 lakh to Rs 30 lakh, while the liquor licence fee for clubs (FL-4) has been raised from Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh. The licence fee for bar in the airport lounge (FL-7) has been increased from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh.

For distilleries and warehouses, the government has decided to double the fee in various categories, that will together fetch Rs 5 lakh additionally per distillery and warehouse. It has also been decided in the new excise policy to charge Rs 2 lakh from each of those distilleries from outside the state that have tie-ups with those within the state to manufacture liquor. The comptroller and auditor general (CAG) had pointed out that the government is losing revenue from such distilleries from outside the state that are manufacturing their products here.

In the toddy sector, the new excise policy has decided that the toddy shops will continue to function and sell toddy for three years or till the toddy board comes into force. The government has decided to set up toddy board in the state and it has been the long pending demand from the sector. The excise policy also decided to fix the quantity of toddy tapped from a coconut tree at two litres per day, which at present is only 1.5 litres per day.

The excise policy has also decided to legalize selling food in toddy shops and also not to make applicable the minimum distance factor for the toddy shops, unlike in the case of IMFL selling shops. However, the excise policy has not made any changes for the licence fee for beer and wine parlours (FL-9) which is now Rs 4 lakh. There are 595 bar hotels and 42 clubs in the state at present.

The government has not considered the long pending demand from IT and tourism sectors that the state needs to provide pubs and micro-breweries as part of improving its social infrastructure. The government has also not considered the proposal for allowing serving liquor in boutique restaurants, especially in major tourism centres. Since the assembly elections in the state will be held next year, the excise policy is expected to be the last one of the current LDF government.

Lucknow: Nearly a third of the total 1.42 million tourists from India who visited Singapore in 2019 were from Uttar Pradesh.

The remarkable figure was revealed by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) on Tuesday during a mini-roadshow to apprise travel agents in UP of different packages it can offer and ways to promote the country to people who have already travelled there once.

As a part of STB’s initiatives to boost its tourism revenue in secondary cities of India, STB area director (India) Raymond Lim said the tourism board was also planning to hold commercial events in UP to promote Singapore and expose the country to people of this state in terms of food and high-street fashion.

“UP has a lot of potential and we saw a decent demand of 28% in 2019 too,” Lim told TOI, stressing that there should be direct air connectivity between UP and Singapore.

India is currently the third largest country in terms of visitors to Singapore.

LUCKNOW: The idols of Ram Lalla are set to be shifted to a fibre structure during Navaratra, which will begin on March 25 and conclude with Ram Navami on April 2. The final date on which the idols will be shifted is yet to be decided.

Ram temple trust member Mahant Dinendra Das told TOI that the dates for shifting of idols would be finalised at the meeting of Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust to be held shortly.

The idols of Ram Lalla were first placed during the intervening night of December 22-23, 1949. After 43 years, the idols were removed when the disputed structure was demolished and placed at a safe location for 24 hours before being put in the makeshift temple.

Now, 28 years later, the idols will again be shifted, though temporarily, from the makeshift structure in Ayodhya when construction of temple begins.

NAGPUR: Nagpur tops the chart in people getting killed while crossing the tracks and also in railway thefts . Trespassing across railway tracks is a punishable offence with a penalty or imprisonment up to 6 months and or fine up to Rs1,000 under Section 147 of the Indian Railways Act.

Information received under RTI Act by activist Abhay Kolarkar from Government Railway Police (GRP) reveals that in the last three years (2017-2019), 59 people died while crossing the tracks under its 126km jurisdiction. Besides, 2,770 cases of thefts were recorded during the same period.

Despite having less kilometrage area under it, Nagpur tops the chart in the region in both the offences in GRP jurisdiction of 1,640km spread across Gondia, Itwari, Nagpur, Wardha , Badnera, and Akola for which information was sought.

In the last three years, overall, 533 passengers met with railway accidental deaths in the above six areas under GRP, while 170 died while crossing the tracks. Besides, 8,086 cases of thefts were recorded in which the stolen material valued over Rs14.89 crore. Of this, valuables in possession of GRP has been valued at over Rs1.89 crore.

KOTTAYAM: On the 50th death anniversary of Mannathu Padmanabhan , the founder of Nair Service Society ( NSS ), chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan , on Tuesday, showered praise on him through a Facebook post.

Vijayan and G Sukumaran Nair, the current NSS chief, were at loggerheads during the Sabarimala women entry issue where Vijayan had slammed the NSS indirectly for standing against renaissance while Nair said that Mannam was the person who was instrumental in bringing renaissance to state.

In the post, Vijayan said the social reforms brought by Mannam have contributed to the formation of the present-day Kerala . The efforts by the NSS under the leadership of Mannam to resist the evil customs based on Manusmrithi is a glorious chapter in the history of Travancore.

Mannam inspired the community members to end bad customs like ‘Pula’, ‘Kettu kalyanam’, ‘Thirandukali’, etc. He led the Nairs to demand temple entry for all castes and to put an end to untouchability. Vijayan also acknowledged the role played by Mannam in the Vaikom and Guruvayur satygraha which were movements against untouchability and caste discrimination in the Hindu society of Kerala. He also acknowledged the lead role taken by Mannam in leading a march by the upper caste men from Vaikom to Thiruvananthapuram asking to allow lower caste people to use the roads on the premises of the Vaikom temple.

Meanwhile, the death anniversary was observed at NSS headquarters at Perunna on Tuesday. Hundreds of delegates from the different Karayogam units across the state queued up at the Mannam Samadhi here to offer floral tributes.

MEERUT: A special court here on Tuesday granted bail to Meerut MP Rajender Agarwal in connection with a case lodged against him eight years ago for allegedly halting a train during a protest over a separate bench of high court in western UP. The BJP MP also got bail in another case-- that of poll code violation-- from the same court.

After coming out of the court, Agarwal said, “I had participated in an agitation in 2012 because of which a train was stopped for around 20 minutes. The case is going on and the court had issued summons for my personal appearance. I got the bail now.”

Sirajuddin Alvi, additional district government counsel (ADGC), said, “Both the cases pertain to 2012. The one that concerns with stopping of train was filed by Railway Police Force of Meerut and the second one was in relation to violation of Model Code of Conduct in which the current MP had given speech without permission.”

This comes days after the court kept into custody BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Pal Tomar and former SP MP Tabassum Hasan for five hours before granting them bail in a 13 year old case of violation of poll code.

The court appears to be getting strict in cases in which senior politicians have not appeared in the court for years. On January 29, SP MLA from Meerut Rafiq Ansari was also served non-bailable warrant in a 13-year-old assault case.

Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan (File Photo)

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Tuesday that UDF has stooped to a low level to accommodate all kinds of communal terrorist ideologies .

Referring to the ‘Occupy Raj Bhavan’ protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) that began on Tuesday, Vijayan said senior UDF leaders had addressed the Jama’at-e-Islami-sponsored protest.

“UDF had direct and indirect alliance with RSS . Now, they are associating with Jama’at-e-Islami and SDPI”, the CM said, while inaugurating the workshop organised for CPM local leaders as part of preparations for local body polls.

Vijayan said efforts are on to mobilize a grand alliance of right-wing forces against the LDF. “The forces which are champions of anti-Left ideals are at the forefront of that alliance. There is a peculiar situation in the state now where the Left-wing extremists and right-wing extremists are joining hands and they oppose the LDF together,” he told over 450 CPM local leaders representing different district committees, area committees and local committees in the state.

The CM said only a secular alliance can defeat the communal agenda propagated by the RSS. “We can’t take on one form of communalism with another one. SDPI and Jama’ath-e-Islami won’t be part of the secular fight against RSS. They need to be kept out of the joint protest by believers and secularists. We should also note that majority of people in Kerala are secular,” he said.

The CM also analyzed the functioning of local bodies in the state.

“There are serious criticisms against the local bodies. The criticisms are mainly about the negative approach of the local bodies. There is no justification for this. The common approach seems to be to put hurdles on all files,” he said. According to Vijayan, unhealthy practices like nokkukooli still exist in some parts of the state and that needs to be addressed.

CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and other senior CPM leaders addressed the daylong session.

Buildings wear different shades of pink at Chaura Rasta.

JAIPUR: The government will issue notices to owners of around 1,200 heritage buildings in Walled City for allegedly altering the facade of the structures. The buildings were identified during a survey by drones which came to an end recently.

Since the Walled City has been included in the UNESCO world heritage list, the government has been given the task to restore it in its original form to keep the tag.

The survey which started in October 2019 has a 3D mapping of the Walled City.

Jaipur chief town planner RK Vijayvargiya said that with the completion of drone survey they will start sending the notices.

“Owners have installed aluminium windows, AC duct and painted different shades of pink colour which are violations of building norms. Along with the notices, we will provide the owners alternate solution to rectify the violation. We have divided the alteration of facade into three categories like minor, moderate and severe. Notices will be sent on that basis,” said Vijayvargiya.

To supervise the heritage issues, a ‘heritage cell’ will be constituted in Jaipur that will send the notices. Two experts and a government official will be member of this cell. The members have already been identified.

Sources in the department, however, said that it is not possible for the government to send notices right before the urban body elections in Jaipur. “Elections will be held in April. So it will not be possible for the government to lay hands on their vote banks. So, any action will be taken after the elections are over or will take at least four months,” said a source.

Meanwhile, town planning department has decided to conduct another drone survey for the areas adjacent to the Walled City that also have heritage structures. “Drone survey of areas like MI Road, Amber, Moti Doongri, Ghat ki Ghooni and many other will start soon. These are buffer zones outside the walled city where heritage structures are established,” said Vijayvargiya. The drone survey is a part of the Heritage Management Plan which will be a composite document of traffic, sewage, parking, encroachment. At present drone survey is done for the buildings situated on the main road. To preserve buildings situated inside, another plan is functioning.

BHOPAL: Central bench of National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Tuesday ordered Bhopal Smart City Corporation Ltd to maintain status quo in terms of green belt in the smart city coming up in Bhopal — which involves cutting of more than 6,000 trees in Tatya Tope Nagar.

In a petition, an NGO Green & Green, contended that Bhopal Smart City Corporation Limited was not leaving community open spaces in the smart city, which are developed in green belts, a mandatory provision in the National Forest Policy -1988.

Counsel for the petitioner, Sachin Verma, told NGT judges that in the Environment Impact Assessment Report submitted by the Bhopal Smart City Corporation, TT Nagar Stadium and T T Nagar Dussehra ground have been shown as “green belt” areas and argued that there could not be any plantation in a stadium or a Dussehra maidan, then how does Smart City Corporation Ltd proposes to develop them as green belt areas.

Referring to the apex court judgements in a number of cases, he said that the Supreme Court has described community open spaces as “lungs of the society” necessary for people in residential areas to breath clean air.

He said that 1,500 trees have already been felled in the areas under Smart City project and another 45,000 would be felled as the project progresses but due to lack of open spaces, compensatory afforestation is not happening in the area.

Verma referred to media reports that the compensatory afforestation against the trees felled in the areas under Smart City would take place in Kaliasot area and asked whether people from Smart City would go to Kaliasot for breathing clean air.

Following preliminary arguments on the issue, the central bench of NGT ordered Smart City Corporation Limited to maintain status quo in the area under its jurisdiction in terms of green belts. When asked what does the tribunal’s interim order signify, Verma said “There can be different interpretations of the order but for me, the NGT has directed for stopping of all construction activities in the Smart City areas”.

“We have yet to receive details of the NGT case. All environmental norms would be complied with,” said BSCDCL official after the NGT order. There are seven smart city projects underway including development of commercial space along TT Nagar stadium and they could be impacted as a result of the case. Smart city development area is predominantly residential in nature with 46% residential share, 11% mixed use development, about 7% commercial, 6.5% educational, 11% open Space/ Parks/ Sports and 2% utilities.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Dismissing the allegations raised by senior Congress leader P T Thomas that Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) plagiarized Pakistan’s 2001 civil service exams while setting questions for Kerala administrative service ( KAS ) preliminary exams held recently, as a substandard allegation, PSC chairman M K Sakeer said it was deliberate attempt to discredit PSC.

“PSC’s procedures while conducting recruitment tests are foolproof, including those for KAS. Such allegations are part of a false campaign against an examination which received accolades from all quarters for its conduct and standard of questions,” Sakeer said on Tuesday. The questions in question were theory-based under subject of public administration, which could figure in similar tests in the world, he pointed out.

In a Facebook post, Thomas alleged that questions 63, 64, 66, 67, 69 and 70 were copied from Pakistan’s 2001 civil service exam, and urged the government to conduct a comprehensive inquiry. “This is serious lapse on the part of the state government and PSC. Action should be initiated against the guilty,” he said. Asserting that KAS preliminary exams maintained a high standard as it was required for an efficient shortlisting from over three lakh candidates, the PSC chairman said the final exams too will maintain a similar standard and will have quality questions.

Sakeer also said that PSC’s directive to block the profile of registered candidates who fail to appear for the exams (which means they will not be able to apply for the recruitment tests to follow) had its desired result of bringing down such tendencies among candidates.

On the PSC’s demand to the government and police to initiate action against coaching centres which misuse the name of the commission, Sakeer said advertising as PSC coaching centre can mislead the public to believe that these centres are either run by PSC or affiliated to it.

LUCKNOW: The alleged mastermind of last Thursday’s fatal attack on a 20-year-old engineering dropout in Gomtinagar Extension surrendered in Lakhimpur Kheri district court on Tuesday. Arpan Shukla (25), the son of a kanungo (court clerk), was later taken into police custody.

Lucknow police commissioner Sujeet Pandey told TOI that they would seek Shukla’s transit remand. “He was on the run since the murder and was forced to surrender following police pressure. We will take him into remand to recover the murder weapon,” Pandey said. A case against him was pending in Kheri.

Last Thursday afternoon, victim Prashant Singh was stabbed at least 10 times at Gate 1 of Alaknanda Apartment in posh Gomtinagar area in front of guards. He bled to death. An FIR was lodged against Shukla and his aides. DCP (East) Somen Barma had announced a reward of Rs 15,000 on Shukla.

Police investigations revealed that Prashant and his friends had had a clash with Shukla and his group at a Barabanki restaurant last Wednesday night. The brawl triggered the attack.

Based on CCTV camera footage from the restaurant and the apartment complex, police identified Aman Bahadur, Abhishek Pandey, Vimal Singh, Abdul Ghani Khan, Tarun Singh and Anjani Yadav as accomplices.

Three of them — son of a former BSP MLA Aman, astrologer’s son Abhishek and Tarun whose father is a businessman — are already in police net.

Jaipur: Rajasthan education department has issued orders to open government schools which were closed during previous government’s tenure due to Right to Education (RTE) violations and school mergers.

About 495 primary schools were closed due to merger of schools and 483 secondary schools were closed due to RTE violations have been identified. School education minister Govind Singh Dotasra on Tuesday announced it in assembly session that all the mergers were done at the time of BJP government’s tenure were against the rules which is being rectified now. These schools will start functioning from this session.

Dotasra said, “BJP government closed and merged 22,200 schools due to which 19,754 school buildings are lying empty. As per the RTE rules, we have decided to open schools with more than 15 students and a distance of more than one km from this session. If the empty school building is now being used for some other purpose, then it will be again allotted to the school. If further budget is required for the schools, we will provide that as well.”

The merger of these schools in 2014 had an adverse effect on the enrolment as well. A research report by an advocacy group, Accountability Initiate (AI), says 22,200 schools were merged for better governance and transparency. Later, 2,500 consolidated schools were reopened due to decline in enrolments by the same government.

The merger of schools in 2014-16 by the previous BJP government has reduced enrolments across social groups (ST, SC and OBC) by around 6 per cent. The decline was higher than the average decline of 1.4% registered across the state during the same period in non-merged schools.

The report says overall enrolment of students with disability declined by 4% between 2015-16 and 2016-17. “The rate of decline was much higher among consolidated schools at 22%,” reads the report.

Thiruvananthapuram: Congress will take the Kuttanad seat from Kerala Congress (Mani) as there is a lack of consensus between PJ Joseph and Jose K Mani factions within the party. This was communicated to both leaders by Congress and IUML leadership at the UDF meet on Tuesday.

IUML and Congress leaders met both leaders separately and said that UDF cannot afford to lose the seat and hence there is no point in having a difference of opinion or internal bickering. Pala result must not reflect in Kuttanad, they said. “We informed them about the seriousness of the issue and stressed on the need to win the seat at any cost,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala after the meeting.

Congress will have a final talk with Joseph and Jose on Saturday in Kochi before taking a final decision. IUML leader PK Kunhalikutty, who was part of the discussion, said no decision was taken and discussions were going on.

It is also learnt that Joseph has almost made up his mind to give Kuttanad seat to Congress. However, Congress leadership is adamant that both factions in the party will not be allowed to select separate candidates. Instead, Congress will declare the candidate by the second week of March.

Meanwhile at the meeting, IUML leaders wanted to settle the differences that had erupted within Congress which they said is affecting the unity of the front. Congress and IUML leaders also met Anoop Jacob and Johnny Nellore separately and urged them to settle their differences.

However, Jacob urged to remove Nellore from the secretary post of UDF since the post was given to Kerala Congress (Jacob) and he has left the party.

LUCKNOW: A young woman who worked as an accountant at a luxury hotel on Rana Pratap Marg allegedly had to quit her job because she was routinely stalked and harassed by another employee. Although the incident took place in August last year, the mother of the woman lodged an FIR at Ghazipur police station on Sunday. A sexual harassment case has been lodged against the accused who is a front desk employee.

According to the FIR, the accused sent the woman smut texts and when she protested, he allegedly threatened to morph her pictures and upload them on social media. “He (the accused) had secretly taken pictures of my daughter while she was at work and had also been stalking her,” the mother said in her complaint. The young woman apparently went into depression after quitting her job and hadn’t confided in her family members until recently. “My daughter shared her ordeal after much persuasion. When we heard why she had left her job, we decided to approach police,” the complainant said.

Ghazipur SHO Brijesh Singh confirmed the FIR. “The accused has been charged with sexual harassment and we are probing the case,” he said.

The petition, filed by M Naveen Kumar , charged them with inaction even in the face of encroachment of lake bed area in survey number 221 of Gajularamaram village.

In his plea, Naveen Kumar said that the encroachers have not spared even the full tank level area and the buffer zone area of a lake in the village and the officials are maintaining stoic silence.

Thiruvananthapuram: As part of Kerala State Nutrition Mission (Sampushta Keralam) project, launched by the department of women and child development (WCD), a two-day national meet will be organized at Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology from February 27. Health minister K K Shailaja said the meet will focus on Hidden Hunger: Challenges and way forward. Governor Arif Mohammed Khan will inaugurate the two-day event that will see the participation of experts within and outside the state.

Though Kerala has made advances in the health sector, it should view the issue of nutrition deficiency among infants and pregnant women as this is causing health problems among children. The event will find a solution to the issue, she said, adding that state’s nutrition policy will be reviewed and a new action plan will be formulated.

The government is trying to implement new and better indices in the sector and Sampushta Keralam was launched for this purpose.

Replying to a query by Singh, agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi said both minimum support price and yield per acre had gone up over last three years but there was no department in the state which had data on farmers’ incomes. “There is no scientific system with the agriculture department to collect this information.

Nagpur: RD Burman and Laxmikant Pyarelal made a lot of experiments while scoring music for films. The magic of their creations was on full display at a programme titled ‘Dosti Suron Ki’, organized by Dande Foundation at Suresh Bhat Sabhagruh, on Tuesday.

The programme, presented by Awesome Musical Group, kept the audience glued to seats as singers excelled in their performances.

The programme started with ‘Kya yehi pyar hai’, sung by Sagar Madhumatke, who specializes in Kishore Kumar’s songs. Vijay Chiwande was the next who sang ‘Gulabi aankhen’.

Isha Ranade was at her best singing ‘Aaj tal paon zameen par nahi rehte mere’, a rather slow song, difficult to sing. Duet ‘Lekar hum deewana dil’, a duet by Sagar Madhumatke and Shruti Choudhari warmed up many a heart.

‘Ek din bik jaayega mati ke mol’, made immortal by Raj Kapoor, was presented by Arvind Patil. Chiwande then came up with ‘Mehbooba’,

Racy song ‘Jaane ja dhoondta phir raha’ by Madhumatke and Shruti Choudhary was greeted with repeated applause.

Shruti’s romantic songs “Kya janu sajan’ and ‘Aao na gale laga lo na’ were a hit.

It was Prashant Khandare whose saxophone did all the talking when he presented ‘Tum aa gaye ho noor aa gaya hai’ and made the atmosphere electrifying.

Isha rendered ‘Sheesha ho ya dil ho’ while Mukul Pande came up with ‘Chahunga main tujhe saanjh savere’.

Sagar took the audience to the heydays of Rajesh Khanna with evergreen ‘Mere dil mein aaj kya hai tu kahe to main’.

Mukul’s qawwali ‘Parda hai parda’ while Isha and Akansha’s rendition of folk song ‘Choli ke pichhe kya hai’ added a dash of colour to the programme.

‘Taro me saj ke’ by Arvind and ‘Bhor bhaye pan ghatpe’ by Isha were nice. ‘Ek pyar ka nagma hai’ by Arvind and Vina Ukunde impressed.

Jyoti Bhagat shared many tid-bits about the origin of songs and singers during the course of the musical.

The programme was conceptualized by Prashant and Prakash Khandare.

The accompanying artistes were Prashant Khandare (saxophone), Prakash (brass), Mahendra Dhole and Raja Rathod (keyboard), Prakash Chauhan (guitar) and Rakesh Wankhede (base guitar).

HYDERABAD: National Cyber Research, Innovation, and Capacity Centre was inaugurated at Central Detective Training Institute (CDTI) at Ramanthapur on Monday with an aim to face cyber threats .

“There is no doubt that such a centre is the need of the hour as with proliferation of information technology life has become easier. But technology itself is a double-edged weapon and therefore criminals misuse it for ulterior purposes,” said Union minister of state for home affairs, G Kishan Reddy, who inaugurated the centre.

“The world in general and India in particular has witnessed a rise in cyber crimes during the last decade and fighting cyber menace is increasingly becoming a global challenge. Our dependence on technology coupled with the government’s intention for digitalisation has created a demand for cyberspace,” he added.

He also informed that ministry of home affairs was also working on setting up regional cyber crime coordination centres (R4Cs) in states. It would be in collaboration with the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) to further strengthen the cyber combat capabilities of the nation, he said.

Talking about CDTI, he said: “It will prove to be central hub for entire south India.”

Representative image

AURANGABAD: The water supply from Cidco N-5 elevated storage reservoir (ESR) to Cidco N-5, N-6 and N-8 areas was delayed by 16 hours after the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation ’s (AMC) water works department failed to repair a broken pipeline on time.

Activists and residents met municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey on Tuesday requesting SMS alerts regarding water supply timings.

The fault in pipeline was detected on Tuesday after the residents of the Cidco N-8 area waited for water supply at 6 am. The residents were getting water after a long wait of five days. However, the taps remained dry until 7 am. The agitated residents then made several calls to the staff at the water works department as well as local corporators. It was only after making several calls did they realise that a pipeline at Avishkar Chowk was damaged and repairs had to be initiated.

At first, the water works department said that water will be supplied at 5 or 6 pm depending on the completion of repair work. When the supply did not resume even after 6 pm, the staff said that the repair work was underway and that the supply will only be restored by 10 pm. Homemakers, especially working couples, faced a lot of problems due to the ineptness of the civic administration.

The repair works had not completed until late on Tuesday evening. Meanwhile, the disruption in supply compelled the residents to buy drinking water from private suppliers.

In Cidco N-3, N-4 and Jai Bhawani Nagar, which are also supplied water from the Cidco N-5 ESR, the disruption in water timings is a common affair. The civic body does not have any mechanism to inform residents about the changes in water supply timings.

Subsequently, on Tuesday, a delegation of residents met municipal commissioner and reiterated the demand for issuing SMS or Whatsapp alerts about water timings. According to Rahul Ingle of Shahar Parivartan Aghadi, the residents pay whopping Rs 4,050 towards water tax annually and that too they get water once in 6 to 7 days.

440,['26/02/2020'],"Want old NPR, no NRC, says Bihar House in one voice","This story is from February 26, 2020

CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Bihar became the first NDA-ruled state on Tuesday to unanimously adopt a resolution to implement the National Population Register (NPR) in the state in its 2010 format, including only the transgender column from the new format. The assembly also adopted a resolution that the “National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) is not needed in Bihar”.

The resolution on the NPR and the NRC, put up by Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary with the consent of the ruling and opposition parties, was adopted unanimously much to the discomfiture of the BJP members, who failed to oppose it.

“It was essential for the smooth functioning of the House. If a resolution is adopted unanimously that means it’s the common view of all the members and this situation is always desirable,” Choudhary later told TOI.

Speaking on the resolution, CM Nitish Kumar clarified in the assembly that the Centre had sought the opinion on NPR from all states and his government had sent a letter communicating its position on both NPR and NRC. It was this letter that was adopted as the resolution in the assembly.

“The Bihar government has already communicated to the Centre that NPR format should be the same as it was in 2010 and only the transgender column should be added to it. The state government’s letter should be considered as the resolution,” Nitish told the House and added: “We have also communicated that NRC is not needed in Bihar.”

Earlier in the day, the assembly witnessed an ugly scene after RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav moved an adjournment notice on NPR and CPI-ML MLA Mehboob Alam on CAA, NPR and NRC. Some BJP and RJD members almost came to blows when Tejashwi dubbed CAA as a “black law”.

Defending his party’s support to CAA in Parliament, Nitish cited statements of former PM Manmohan Singh and other Congress leaders in Parliament demanding Indian citizenship for the persecuted minorities in the neighbouring countries.

The “unanimous” resolution, however, was used as a tool of political one-upmanship as Tejashwi claimed that the government bowed to RJD pressure and JD (U) ally BJP, which failed to oppose the resolution, denied that the government bowed to RJD pressure.

BJP state vice-president and Baikunthpur MLA Mithilesh Tiwari told TOI, “PM has himself clarified that there has been no discussion on NRC, as of now. So, discussing the issue is like celebrating the ‘mundan’ of a baby before birth. Tejashwi should not feel elated as BJP never deviates from its principles and it is the party which has forced a country like Pakistan to kneel down.”

Political observers feel that the opposition fell in the government’s trap over the resolution, which suits Nitish, who was under pressure from the minority community to re-establish his secular credentials after joining hands with BJP again.

It is also seen as a masterstroke to blunt the sharp attack from RJD-led opposition and the likes of CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar, who is on a state-wide yatra against NRC, were trying to make NPR and NRC major issues in the coming assembly election.

Students of MMPS Chitkul, a school in Medak, browse through their new books

HYDERABAD: The children of Dogra Nagar in Jammu often wake up to sounds of shelling. On days like these, they gingerly find their way to the house of an elderly couple because it means escape in more ways than one.The house, which doubles as a community library , is stacked with books that tell stories about children like them in lands away from theirs. And the books had been brought from homes of children their age, living over 2,000 kilometers away in Hyderabad.The books made the journey from Hyderabad to Jammu thanks to the efforts of city based couple, Srinivas Rao and Shefali Rao.The duo that run a consultancy firm in Banjara Hills, are book-lovers who wanted to revive the dying art of reading. In less than four years, the couple and their team of volunteers have managed to spread the reading bug to villages and semi-urban areas in 22 states. With 303 libraries, Food4Thought Foundation has reached prisons, schools and hospitals across India.“Stories deserve to be heard more than once. We source books through donations or buy them, segregate them into genres and identify locations that need books but have no access to them,” says Srinivas, founder of Food4Thought.Shefali says that they work like a corporate, with pie-charts to record their progress, a tracker to gauge the reception of books by readers and an extended network of volunteers who are committed to story-telling.“There are areas such as Nongshken Village in Meghalaya that courier companies refuse to deliver packages to. So we have volunteers who carry books on their backs and scale hilly terrains to deliver books,” Shefali says, stressing that the spine of the foundation is its well-connected bunch of volunteers.The curation of each library by founders and volunteers takes into account the age of the reader, the setting of the library and readers’ exposure to the language.The foundation also receives monthly feedback from all 303 libraries to assess progress being made by readers. Strategies are developed for libraries that record lesser footfall.“For instance, in a school in Khammam, children were scared to touch the new books. So the principal hung the books on a clothesline, to make books less intimidating,” says Madhavi Sharma, co-founder of Food4Thought.The economics of running the foundation has been a constant challenge, says the team. The foundation sends books to five libraries every week, costing them close to half a lakh per month in courier charges alone. Established four years ago, the organization only recently qualified for CSR status. But over 70% of funds come from the founders’ pockets. The rest is collected through donations.“Team members, including co-founders, draw almost no salary. The money we make through our firm is routed to meet the foundation’s demand,” says Srinivas.To the proverbial ‘what next’ question, the team says, “We hope to set up 500 libraries by December. We want to create a network to connect book-lovers across the country. We also plan to develop Braille and audio books to make storytelling more inclusive.”Rushing to pack the next bundle of books, Shefali says, “We want the country to know that for every child there is a story waiting to be discovered, enjoyed and retold.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74317864,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-78401,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-couple-has-a-story-for-every-child/articleshow/74309509.cms

Swamy who was in Nainital was responding to questions when he was asked about the clashes between the pro and anti-CAA protesters in Northeast Delhi. Swamy said that the CAA will not affect any Muslim in the country and that since there have been no discussions on the National Register of Citizens, the people are protesting against something that hasn’t even been proposed yet. “The protesters are protesting for something that hasn’t even happened yet. The CAA will not affect Muslims and the NRC hasn’t even come into effect, therefore, there is no need to protest,” Swamy said.

When asked what effect the protests will have on the visit of the US President Donald Trump, Swamy said, “Trump came to India with good intent. Therefore the protests will not have any impact on his visit,” he said.

AURANGABAD: After local businessmen raised concerns about the hawker menace in the market areas of Paithan Gate, Gulmandi and Tilak Path, municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey agreed to deploy guards to ensure that the markets are free of illegal hawkers .

The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is yet to work upon its hawkers’ zone policy.

A delegation of businessmen representing Aurangabad Jilha Vyapari Mahasangh and Paithan Gate-Tilak Path Vyapari Association met the municipal commissioner on Tuesday against the backdrop of parking policy and hawkers’ zone policy approved by the general body of the AMC recently.

According to the hawkers’ zone policy, the AMC had said that it would issue licences to street vendors in market areas of Paithan Gate, Gulmandi and Tilak Path. The AMC had planned to charge the vendors on a daily basis for plying their business in the market areas. However, the businessmen who have their shops in these areas, said that they are already facing inconvenience due to hawkers as they occupy space in front of their shops and prevent customers from parking or entering the shops.

They also said that the new policy of the civic body would authorise the hawkers further increasing the problems of the shopkeepers.

Pandey told the businessmen that the municipal corporation is in process of identifying spaces for specifying hawkers’ zones in the city. However, the hawkers are not allowed to conduct business in the ‘no hawkers’ zone.’

Jagannath Kale, president of Aurangabad Jilha Vyapari Mahasangh, said that after insistence of the delegation, the municipal commissioner said that the AMC would put up ‘no hawker zone’ signboards in market areas. The businessmen also demanded that AMC’s vigilance squad must be deployed in market areas to ensure that hawkers comply with the directive.

“My grandfather Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan Bahadur was the prime example and epitome of a religiously tolerant and benevolent ruler. Most of the services developed under his guidance and rule are still in use and remembered by the common people. His compassionate services and achievements have not been highlighted by any of the governments, which hurts our sentiments,” Najaf Ali Khan said.

He added that the tradition of secularism followed by the Asaf Jahi rulers was maintained by Nizam VII during his reign. “There are scores of examples of the secular nature of the Nizam VII. One such example is that he always extended financial help equally to Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Sikhs for religious and educational institutions and did not discriminate,” Najaf Ali Khan added.

On Tuesday, jal shakti minister Mahendra Singh remarked there was no stray cattle here as the Yogi government had built cow shelters all over the state.The comment drew criticism from the Opposition.

“The jal shakti minister’s claim that there are no stray cattle in the state is ridiculous. It also contradicts the answer by Suresh Khanna, who had informed the House that the adjoining states were pushing their animals into UP,” said Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary as leader of Congress legislature party Aradhana Mishra joined him.

Commission To Be Fully Staffed After Four Years

PANAJI: The Goa State Human Rights Commission, which has been non-functional for the past six months, began functioning again on Wednesday after former high court judge U V Bakre took over as chairperson.

“Notices have been sent to parties and regular hearings will commence in March,” an official told TOI.

For the first time in almost four years, the commission will function at full strength, with former principal district judge Desmon D’Costa and former law secretary and judge Pramod Kamat as members.

There are over 300 cases pending before the commission. Besides, there are 100 complaints that were inwarded over the past six months but could not be registered as the commission was memberless. Former judge A D Salkar completed his term in July last year.

“The procedure has now started. The commission has begun checking the complaints and where it finds there is a violation of human rights, it has been directing that these be registered and that reports called for,” an official told TOI.

The rights panel never had a full-fledged commission after 2016, when former Patna high court chief justice P K Mishra completed his term as the commission’s first chairperson. The commission has been headless for almost four years, and, since member J A Keny died in September 2018, functioned with only Salkar as member.

Among the first cases the commission will hear, on directions of the high court, is the complaint of unhygienic food allegedly provided to police personnel during the the BRICS summit in 2016.

The hearing will commence on March 2.

The high court last week quashed the April 2019 inquiry report/order of the commission which had recommended that the director general of police impose appropriate penalty on the caterer, and the subsequent show cause notice issued by the police, and directed the commission to decide the matter afresh after offering opportunity to both advocate Aires Rodrigues and Amoncar classic caterers.

Complaints of human rights violations ranging from police assault, and denial of pension and salaries to pollution of waterbodies and poor condition of roads and bridges, have been filed before the commission.

453,['26/02/2020'],Dip in GST cess mop-up to hit states hard: Mitra,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Kolkata: West Bengal finance and industries minister Amit Mitra who also was the head of the empowered committee of state finance ministers for GST rollout was worried about the slow growth of GST cess collection in the last few months. This would leave the finances of the states in serious jeopardy, feels Mitra.

The Bengal FM was deeply concerned that whether the Centre can pay GST compensation to states following the massive fall in growth of GST cess collection. While speaking at a conference on ‘West Bengal, Poised to Lead, Business & Beyond’ organised by CII, Mitra indicated that the growth of cess collection has gone down to just 1.5% from targeted 21%.

Describing the current situation as grim, Mitra explained that GST cess was meant for giving the compensation to the states as was decided by GST Council during the rollout of the new indirect tax regime. Taking 2015-16 as the base year, the states are supposed to get a compensation if the growth of tax collection falls below 14% level on year-on-year basis.

However, the Bengal finance minister feels that as GST cess has failed to achieve targeted growth figure, and the Centre cannot pay the compensations either. “My concern is whether at all we shall get the GST compensations for February and March,” he added.

West Bengal has not received the compensation for January either. “The finances of all the states would be in deep trouble if the Centre does not pay the compensation. Several states as far as we know have resorted to overdraft and ‘ways and means’ funds to meet the commitment,” he added.

Mitra also criticised centre for increasing various cess and surcharges which are not part of state devolution. “In last 2-3 years, we have observed that cess and surcharge has gone up many fold. Centre should have done this by raising taxes and duties then states would have got the benefit but here only centre is getting the money,” he added.

The Bengal FM explained that besides GST cess, there was an increase in cess and surcharge on customs duty, excise duty as well, which are not part of GST compensation formula either. Mitra came down heavily on GST network as well as overall financial corruption by added that there has been 14 times increase in suspicious transactions from 62,000 to 14.36 lakh in the last few years. There has been Rs 46,000-crore penal interest as well as in GST, which was not recovered. “There has been a sharp increase in cost of compliance as well post GST,” he added.

Later, commenting on West Bengal growth story, Mitra claimed that as per revised estimate of the Centre, West Bengal has achieved a GSDP growth of 10.4% in the current fiscal, which is double that of the country’s GDP of 5%.

Last year, too, the state had achieved a 12.5% growth compared to 6-6.5% nationally.

(File photo of Samajwadi party MP Azam Khan)

RAMPUR: A day after rejecting anticipatory bail pleas of Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan , wife Tanzeen Fatimah and son Abdullah Azam, who are both MLAs, and declaring them “absconders”, a local court on Tuesday ordered “confiscation of their moveable and immovable properties” in connection with a forgery case. The accused have been chargesheeted under various sections of IPC for allegedly helping their son obtain two fake birth certificates.

In a separate case related to an alleged encroachment over enemy property by Azam Khan, additional district and sessions judge Dhirendra Kumar Kamboj had granted anticipatory bail to Azam on Monday but ordered him to surrender his passport to police and seek court’s prior permission before embarking on a foreign trip.

In September 2019, the court had issued summons to all three lawmakers, after taking cognisance of the chargesheet filed by Rampur police, in which all three have been charged with forgery and cheating. The court had directed the SHO of Ganj Kotwali police station, under whose jurisdiction the family resides, to ensure compliance of its order.

Thereafter, the court had issued non-bailable warrants against the Khans after they had failed to present themselves before it.

After the prosecution claimed that the accused were clandestinely shifting valuables from their house, on the directions of the court, police carried out an inquiry and found the charges to be true.

Following this, the court invoked section 82 of CrPC to proclaim them “absconders”. The court directed the police to comply with the proclamation notice against Azam Khan and others into the matter.

The accused have been chargesheeted under sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

On January 3, 2019, local BJP leader Akash Saxena had lodged a complaint alleging that Azam and his wife helped their son in obtaining two fake birth certificates – one from Lucknow and another from Rampur – following which an FIR was registered at Ganj Kotwali.

Additional district government counsel Ram Avtar Saini said, “The court rejected the anticipatory bail applications of Azam Khan, his wife and son in three separate cases related to Abdullah's date of birth certificates, PAN cards and passport.”

Fully AC coach local train at Churchgate railway station

MUMBAI: In a sign of things to come, the Central Railway has proposed having two classes in AC trains-first and second-and tweaking the fare structure to draw passengers towards the air-conditioned service.

The proposal comes against the backdrop of poor response to its first AC local introduced on the transharbour corridor last month. CR runs only 12 AC services a day. These services have caused lot of resentment as they were introduced by replacing non-AC trains. Subsequently, CR has not introduced any more AC trains though it has three AC rakes and the fourth is on its way to its carshed -rolling out AC services means removing non-AC ones due to lack of path.

CR's principal chief operating manager DK Singh has written to the railway board member (traffic) to make a case for rationalisation of fare structure. In a letter dated February 17, Singh wrote, ""The patronisation of AC rakes is not encouraging. The reasons are excessive fare compared to second class non-AC travel, skeleton AC services being run on certain identified routes, thus depriving complete migration from non-AC to AC.""

Singh also submitted a detailed note to justify the proposal. ""Fare of AC EMU is 1.3 to 2.6 times that of first class fare. 10% of the total suburban travel is first class and 90% by second class. For 90% of second class passengers, the difference in fare between second class fare and AC class is prohibitive. Thus migration to AC is not forthcoming.""

Singh suggested that existing AC rakes be modified with earmarked first class and second classes. ""With this combination, migration of second class passengers can be made possible... Second AC fare will be higher than non-AC but lower than existing first class non-AC or present AC class. This reasonable increase will be acceptable to passengers as compensation to better AC and risk-free environment of safe travel. First class will be provided with cushioned seats, mobile charging points.""

Regarding the fare, he suggested that Delhi Metro fare structures with a minimum of Rs 10 and maximum of Rs 60 be made applicable for second class AC . For first class AC, he suggested the present fare structure be retained. He also suggested the second AC fare be increased gradually as more rakes are introduced.

Candlelight protest in Marine Drive against Monday night Delhi violence

MUMBAI: The Marine Drive police on Tuesday filed a case of unlawful assembly against a group of at least 30 people for gathering at Marine Drive. The group carried out a candlelight protest against the Monday night violence in Delhi.

A few of the people in the group gave speeches against the violence that took place in some parts of Delhi on Monday. Those supporting the CAA and NRC clashed with the protesters. Stones were pelted, properties were set ablaze, and bullets were fired in Delhi, and 13 people, including a policeman, were killed.

No arrest has been made yet. The only notified area for protest in Mumbai is Azad Maidan. ""We have registered a case and are probing it further,"" said zonal DCP S Nishandaar. ""We have booked them for conducting protest without permission and assembling unalwfully,"" said a senior officer.

On several occasions in the past, police detained protestors and let them go after taking their details. Recently, police said they should be aware about who is gathering to protest to avoid confusion or untoward incidents.

Indrani Mukerjea

MUMBAI: During arguments on her fifth bail plea, Sheena Bora murder accused Indrani Mukerjea told the special CBI court on Tuesday that the victim was alive six months after her alleged murder on April 24, 2012 and was with her fiance Rahul Mukerjea . Citing Rahul's call data records, Indrani pointed to a text message exchange allegedly between him and Sheena from September 2012.

""The evidence that they have relied upon to charge me with the murder of Sheena establishes that she was alive and with Rahul on September 26, 27 and 28, 2012,"" Indrani said. She read out the alleged messages from September 27, 2012. One from Rahul, she said, was: ""Baba am in the car park. Come na.""

Indrani said Sheena replied ""5 mins, bubs"" and then Rahultexted, ""Eh chalo jaldi"".

Indrani said, ""This is happening six months after her alleged murder. This explains why none of the bodies (two sets of remains that CBI purported were Sheena's) match with Sheena's."" Indrani pointed this out to contradict the CBI's claims that she was last seen with Sheena on the night she was murdered.

Indrani submitted that no one could say she had sent these messages to Rahul as she was in England at that time. ""And also, it will be very odd if Rahul in the entire message is talking about coming there in ten minutes, sitting in the car park and then Indrani walks down (instead of Sheena). It is not possible,"" Indrani said. She said she had go through 4,000 messages before she found these.

One of the helicopters sealed by the BMC in Juhu on Tuesday to recover Rs 1.6 crore

MUMBAI: With just a little more than a month left for the BMC to meet its property collection target for the financial year, the municipal corporation on Tuesday cracked the whip on two tax defaulters. It disconnected the water supply of a commercial building in Kalina, the Wadhwa Trade Centre, and sealed two helicopters of Mesco airlines in Juhu .

An official said it was the first time that action by the BMC involved movable property as well.

Municipal officials said the Wadhwa property owed the BMC Rs 13.3 crore, of which only around Rs 2 crore was paid. The payment has been pending since 2013. ""Water supply will be restored after the remaining amount is paid,"" a municipal official from the assessment and collection department said.

A Wadhwa Group spokesperson said it had challenged the property tax assessment, claiming that the amount owed was not more than Rs 6 crore. ""Of this, half the amount is to be paid by the building society. We will clear our share within the next few weeks,"" the spokesperson said. He said the BMC levied its building property tax rate applicable in the Bandra-Kurla Complex when its building is in Kalina.

The BMC claimed it was still to issue bills to individual establishments in the building and that the unpaid amount ws for the entire structure that the owner had to pay.

In Juhu, the BMC sealed two helicopters of Mesco airlines to recover over Rs 1.6 crore for 2019-2020. ""The company cannot move the helicopters as it was decided to seal them at the site,"" a municipal official said.

The BMC property tax collection target for the year is over Rs 5,000 crore and so far around Rs 3,152 crore has been collected.

Deputy municipal commissioner Ramesh Pawar said the BMC always follows the requisite process before taking harsh action.

""We first raise a demand notice, after which awareness is created by asking people to come and pay their taxes, and if the same is still not paid then water connection is disconnected, following which an attachment-cum-distress-warrant is issued and, lastly, the property is auctioned. This is the first time we are cracking down on movable properties as well. We have also decided to publish the names of the top 10 defaulters in the newspapers if they continue to evade paying taxes,"" Pawar said.

459,['26/02/2020'],Two passengers allotted same berth in Duronto Exp,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Nagpur: A woman with a confirmed train ticket booked three months ago had to suffer severe humiliation when her berth was allotted to a RAC passenger recently. She was also forced to pay Rs 1,150 penalty for travelling ‘without ticket’, and ended up sleeping on the floor.

The railways claimed the woman’s ticket would be ‘deemed cancelled’ if it was booked by an agent using an individual’s login ID. However, the woman’s return ticket booked using the same ID was not cancelled.

In a complaint to Central Railway’s Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) at Nagpur, R Sridevi claimed she booked e-ticket (PNR 8126631992) on November 2, 2019, for travel by 12290 Nagpur-CSMT Duronto Express to Mumbai on February 14, using her personal ID.

Sridevi had been allotted seat number 57 in S-7 coach. “When the train was nearing Wardha, during ticket checking, I showed my e-ticket to the TTE. But he told me the berth was in some other passenger’s name, and my name did not figure in the list of confirmed passengers,” she said.

“The TTE asked me to vacate the seat I had booked three months ago, and threatened to offload me at Bhusawal and hand me over to RPF. However, since travelling to Mumbai was urgent, I proceeded with the journey, for which TTE charged Rs 1,150 as excess fare ticket (EFT). The EFT was prepared near Wardha, but it mentioned Ajni. I had to sleep on the floor and went through severe mental stress,” Sridevi said.

She added, “In Duronto, there is flexi fare system. I paid Rs 530 while booking berth and the RAC passenger who was allotted my berth paid Rs 705. This indicates I was the first to book the berth. So, how was the berth given to another passenger? My ticket also clearly mentions it was booked on a personal ID.”

“A bonafide woman passenger travelling alone in the night was deprived of her right for no fault. The treatment I was meted out by the TTE was very shabby. From one single berth the railways collected Rs 2,385 (Rs 530 original fare, Rs 705 from RAC passenger, and Rs 1,150 as penalty) against normal fare of Rs 490,” she said.

In the same journey, two passengers travelling in AC-III compartment to CSMT also did not find their names in the chart and paid a penalty of over Rs 7,000.

Assistant commercial manager (ACM) & Central Railway spokesperson SG Rao said, “On February 11, RPF personnel had seized a bunch of 11 tickets from an unauthorized agent. These tickets were booked with the user ID from which Sridevi had booked her ticket. Such tickets are deemed to be cancelled, and hence passenger names don’t appear in the chart.”

Rao added, “RPF officials are investigating cases related to these seized tickets. Only after completion of probe can we confirm genuineness of Sridevi’s ticket.”

However, Sridevi argued, “How can two user IDs and passwords be the same? Also, if this was the case, why was my return ticket of February 16 from Mumbai, booked at the same time, not blocked?”

President Donald Trump addresses a news conference in New Delhi. (Picture credit: NYT)

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that he had brought up the issue of religious freedom in India with PM Narendra Modi . “We did talk about religious freedom. I will say that the PM was incredible and he told me that he wants people to have religious freedom. He told me that in India they have worked very hard to have great and open religious freedom,” he said.

Asked about alleged discrimination against Muslims and rise in hate crimes against them under Modi, the president said, “Well, we discussed that and specifically Muslims and we also discussed Christians, I had a very powerful answer from the PM. We talked about religious liberty for a long period of time in front of a lot of people and I had a very, very powerful answer. And the PM said we have 200 million Muslims in India and a fairly short while ago they had 14 million and he said they have been working very closely with the community.”

Trump’s disinclination to speak on CAA must come as a relief for the government, which had billed the visit as a big leap in India-US ties aimed at cementing and advancing a crucial strategic partnership spanning antiterrorism cooperation to trade and commerce.

On another tricky terrain, that of Kashmir , Trump repeated his favourite formulation that he could help or mediate and referred to there being “two sides to every story” but did so without any particular vehemence.

“We talked a lot about Pakistan. I have very good relations with PM Imran Khan . We talked about it at length actually. No question that it’s a problem. But it’s a problem they have been working on. India is a brave nation and I have said I will do whatever I can do because my relations with both gentlemen (Modi and Khan) is so good. But there have been difficulties in Pakistan and we are seeing what we can do about it. Anything I can do to mediate, anything I can do to help, I will do,” Trump said.

He emphasised the convergence between the two nations as well as between him and Modi on terrorism. “We discussed terrorism and I think we have some very good ideas. I feel very strongly against terrorism.PM Modi is a very religious man as you know, he is a very calm man but actually he is a very very strong person. Very tough actually, I have seen him in action and he has got that foremost in his mind — terrorism,” he said.

The tenor of Trump’s remarks reflected the Indian side’s view that India and the US are increasingly moving together on critical areas of national security, energy and technology with ties rebadged as a “comprehensive global strategic partnership” as the two leaders announced earlier in remarks to media.

The president’s remarks were punctuated with strong praise for Modi and an implicit acknowledgement that he found the PM’s response to issues of religious freedom in India and on terrorism sourced from Pakistan convincing.

In his briefing, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said Trump didn’t specifically bring up CAA. “You would have heard President Trump in his speech yesterday in Ahmedabad referring to religious diversity and harmony that is evident in India; discussions really to the extent possible were on these lines on this issue,” he said. “The issue of CAA did not come up; there was appreciation from both sides that pluralism and diversity are a common binding factor of both countries,” he said.

Vijayawada: Chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy on Tuesday said that the distribution of house-site pattas for the poor on March 25 will make it a red-letter day in the history of Andhra Pradesh.

Reviewing the progress of Spandana programme here on Tuesday, the CM said accountability should be the hallmark of the programme while receiving grievances from people and clearing them in a week.

He said alerts are a must to make the programme a success.

All collectors were advised to take the help of the officials if need be and complete land acquisition, marking of plots by March 1. The marked plots should be developed at the earliest and beneficiaries decided on the basis of a lottery and the collectors should be liberal in allocation of plots, the CM said. He added that there should be a thorough supervision of requisitions from people for plots from ward and village secretariats.

The CM directed the officials to ensure the completion of the house-to-house survey and mapping at the earliest by volunteers at ward and village secretariats as it would enable them to deliver the schemes at the door-steps easily. He said maintaining attendance register for the staff at the secretariats should be made mandatory.

DGP Gowtham Sawang informed the CM that an early verdict in the rape-and-murder case in Chittoor was possible with the immediate charge-sheet filed by police and providing concrete evidence in the court. The CM congratulated Chittoor SP Senthil on the occasion. He directed chief secretary to take immediate action to set up special courts.

With reference to complaints of power cuts from Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and East Godavari districts and water problem in Krishna, West Godavari and Kurnool districts the CM directed the officials to take immediate action on the issues.

Vijayawada: The four vacant seats from the state to Rajya Sabha are likely to go in favour of YSRC once the elections take place by the first week of April.

On Tuesday, the Commission issued the notification for Rajya Sabha elections to be held on March 26. YSRC already have two RS members.

The term of Rajya Sabha members K Kesava Rao (TRS), M A Khan and T Subbarami Reddy (Congress) and Thota Sitarama Lakshmi (TDP) will get over on April 9.

TDP lost three MPs--Y S Chowdary, T G Venkatesh and C M Ramesh--to BJP earlier in 2019. With the retirement of Sitarama Lakshmi, TDP would have only one member in the Upper House from the state.

With the retirement of Khan and Subbarami Reddy, Congress would be without any members from the state in the Upper House of Parliament.

K V P Ramachandra Rao, who represents Telangana, too would retire on April 9.

With six members in Rajya Sabha, YSRC may get to play a bigger role as NDA does not have a majority in Rajya Sabha.

463,['26/02/2020'],Naidu questions CM Jagan’s absence from Trump dinner hosted by Prez,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Tirupati: TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday alleged that chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy was not invited to the dinner hosted by President Ramnath Kovind in honour of visiting US President Donald Trump in New Delhi “as the USA does not like dealing with leaders involved in cases”.

Naidu made the remarks at a press conference in his native Kuppam in Chittoor district. ‘‘US laws are very strict and generally the US government does not deal with anyone who is involved in criminal or economic offences of any kind. That’s why they didn’t entertain an economic offender like Jagan ,” alleged Naidu.

The YSRC reacted sharply to Naidu’s allegation. “Naidu is only degrading himself with such comments. The Union government invited only eight chief ministers for the dinner. Naidu is trying to link it with the disproportionate assets cases on Jagan for political gains. Naidu is the biggest financial offender in the country. He is facing allegations in the vote-for-note scam, ESI scam, insider trading in Amaravati lands and other cases. He should respect the mandate given by people before making such comments,” fumed Malladi Vishnu Vardhan, Vijayawada Central MLA, who is also the chairman of AP Brahmin Corporation.

Earlier, Naidu addressed rallies as part of his Praja Chaitanya Yatra at Kangundi, Govindapalli, Vijalapuram and Dandikuppam on the second day of his Kuppam tour. Flaying Jagan for “disillusioning the future of the state by adopting flawed policies”, Naidu said all good work done by his government has come to a standstill.

464,['26/02/2020'],YSRC leaders slam TDP’s Praja Chaitanya Yatra,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Vijayawada: Responding to the ongoing Praja Chaitanya Yatra, which has been undertaken by the TDP to sensitise people on the ‘failures’ of the YSRC government, several prominent YSRC leaders held press conferences across the state on Tuesday.

Across the state, they strongly advocated for decentralisation of development and rejected Chandrababu Naidu idea of concentrating development in one place. Referring to the Amaravati unrest, the YSRC leaders alleged that Naidu has been trying to damage the image of Andhra Pradesh by creating unrest through sponsored agitations. He is using the media to propagate a distorted and false versions of the incidents and engineering attacks on Nandigam Suresh, Vidathala Rajini and others as he is nervous about the SIT probing the irregularities in land pooling, they alleged.

In Kadapa, deputy chief minister Amzadh Basha reiterated that an all-round development can only take place through decentralisation and the government is committed to it.

“Naidu started Praja Chaitanya Yatra for his benefit and to protect his benamis. He will be sent to jail soon for the corruption during his regime” Basha said.

In Srikakulam Dharmana Prasada Rao, minister for roads and buildings, told the media that Amaravati is an example of Naidu’s business model. He was concentrating only on one region even after he lost Hyderabad.

“The difference between Jaganmohan Reddy and Naidu is very clear. While Naidu has given sops before the elections, Jaganmohan Reddy has launched numerous schemes during his first six months in office. While Naidu wanted to develop only one region and concentrate on one place, our leader wants to decentralise development,’’ he asserted.

Speaking on similar lines, MLA Kakani Govardhan Reddy in Nellore said Naidu was trying to create unrest in the state to send false signals. The concept of self-financing is nothing but real estate business and is aimed at only creating wealth to his coterie. MLA Kotamreddy Sridhar Reddy accused Naidu of using the media to damaging AP’s brand image by spreading false rumours.

Chief advisor (public affairs), Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy while addressing the state trade union working committee in Tadepalli said decentralisation is the only option for a uniform development of all regions. “We have brought in village secretariats for the convenience of the people,” he said.

465,['26/02/2020'],"Hindi theatre stages comeback in city, needs more promotion","This story is from February 26, 2020

Nagpur: In an indication of the growing popularity of Hindi plays, the ongoing 51st Maharashtra State Hindi Theatre competition is drawing a decent response from city theatre aficionados. The audience has grown as the number of Hindi plays being staged has increased. However, a ‘houseful’ tag for a Hindi play still seems to be a distant dream.

Directors, writers and theatre artistes, all agree that Hindi theatre is finding its feet in Nagpur, where Marathi theatre is dominant. They feel, though, that Hindi theatre still lacks in good promotion skills.

Vaidehi Chawre, coordinator of the theatre fest, said that though the response is decent, the plays haven’t been able to garner a full house yet. She adds, “The ongoing Hindi theatre competition is not attracting expected audience. Maybe because of show slots. For instance, not everyone is OK with morning shows on weekdays.”

Salim Sheikh, a well-known writer and director, predominantly works in Marathi theatre but also dabbles in Hindi theatre, is happy to see the increase in number of good Hindi plays being staged in Nagpur. “I believe love and respect for Hindi theatre has increased in the city, and Vidarbha at large, since the last few years. There were times when hunting for a handful of good Hindi plays was a task. Yet, now there are plenty of well written plays,” he said.

Agreeing with Sheikh, Lalit Ghavghave, a theatre actor, believes that there are a select few good Hindi plays that are staged, maybe once a month or so. “Here, people's Hindi also carries an essence of Marathi. I believe there should be equal promotion of Hindi plays, so the beauty of quality theatre is enjoyed by audience in both language,” he said.

However, Virendra Ganvir, whose play was also staged in the theatre competition, feels that there is an equal set of audience for both Hindi and Marathi plays. “Number of people showing up for Hindi plays is less than the Marathi ones, but if any play carries a good story and acting, it will always outshine,” he said.

As for promoting Hindi theatre in the city, there are more factors at play than just the language. “Before planning any state-level Hindi competition, government must chose appropriate timings. Nobody will take leave to watch a play at 12 noon, during office hours,” added Salim Sheikh.

Writer-director Shital Dodke feels that choosing appropriate centres will also facilitate smooth staging of these plays, “Usually, the plays are held at different centres. Even though the audience has increased, are we attracting enough audience? It needs more promotion and appropriate season for such contests,” he said.

The agitation was in full swing at six places in Nagpur and 13 locations in the district

NAGPUR: BJP workers on Tuesday upped their ante against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government by kick-starting a statewide agitation to highlight various issues, including injustice to farmers, spanner in the wheels of developmental works and atrocities against women.

The agitation was in full swing at six places in Nagpur and 13 locations in the district. BJP leaders like Vijay Puranik, Mayor Sandip Joshi, ex-mayor Pravin Datke and ex-guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule slammed the Uddhav Thackarey-led MVA government. The murder of Ankita Pisudde in Hinganghat and the acid attack in Gondia were among the prominent issues raised.

Party MLAs Krishna Khopde , Mohan Mate, Vikas Kumbhare and ex-MLAs Dr Milind Mane, Sudhakar Kohale, Sudhakar Deshmukh, Sudhir Parwe and other leaders were present at different locations where demonstrators raised slogan against Thackeray’s decisions of stalling projects started by the BJP government under former CM Devendra Fadnavis.

Bawankule, who led the agitation in rural Nagpur, said at a press conference that the MVA coalition failed to keep its promise of compensation up to Rs 25,000 per hectare to farmers hit by untimely rains and another Rs 50,000 per hectare to owners of orchards due to crop failure. He pointed out that the BJP government had disbursed Rs 19,000 crore to 43 lakh account holders through ryot compensation schemes.

Bawankule also came down heavily on the government for reversing many decisions of the previous BJP-led government. He also said that it would a challenging task for the incumbent leaders of the MVA coalition to retain the allocated district planning funds.

Anusaya Gupta, women president of South-East Nagpur unit of BJP and also member of the state women’s commission, said there were demands for stringent laws against assaults on women. She was present at the agitation held at Chhatrapati chowk.

Nagpur: Forgetting their opposition to the proposed national exit test ( NEXT ) for MBBS graduates before they start their practice, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Tuesday organized a workshop for them about the test. Junior doctors’ network and medical students’ network — two important wings of the IMA — invited Dr Rajat Jain from New Delhi to do the task.

“IMA has objections about many provisions in the National Medical Commission (NMC) bill. Exist examination for MBBS graduates used to be one of them. But now the medical body has decided to go along with the exit test. First NEXT is scheduled to be held in 2022,” said Dr Jain, who is recognized as a great guide by medical students across the country.

As a student, Dr Jain had cracked PG-NEET entrance with Rank I and he is known for providing key insights to passing entrance tests with flying colours. The workshop organized by IMA Nagpur and witnessed jam-packed attendance of students.

“Students who started their MBBS in 2017 will appear for NEXT for the first time. The score in NEXT will also serve as their score in entrance examination for PG courses (PG-NEET). The format of NEXT is broader than existing PG-NEET and it will test their clinical knowledge thoroughly,” he said.

Dr Jain suggested MBBS students to start attending their classes seriously and understand the concepts. “Take your clinical postings very seriously and complete internship honestly. Try to gather as much of practical knowledge as you can as the pattern is drastically changing and you can expect a lot of weight given to such clinical oriented pattern of questions,” he added.

IMA Nagpur branch organized this workshop for the first time in the city. Former president of IMA Nagpur Dr Ashish Disawal, who is now national vice-chairman of IMA students’ activity wing, was the coordinator.

IMA Nagpur President Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala said the workshop was of great benefit for the MBBS students preparing for PG-NEET and to those who are waiting to fill admission forms for PG after clearing their PG-NEET. “Doctors received great guidance in this workshop about their preference filling process, and entire PG admission process,” he said.

NAGPUR: Enraged over denial of a blanket for sleeping at night, a dhaba worker allegedly killed the eatery owner in the early hours of Tuesday.

The deceased has been identified as Prakash Jaiswal, 53, owner of a dhaba at Wadamba village on Pauni-Navegaon road. The police have arrested accused Kara Bawan, who was allegedly left angry after Jaiswal had denied him a blanket after two guests had walked in at the dhaba for a night stay.

It’s learnt that Jaiswal was fast asleep when Bawan assaulted him with a stick on his head, face and neck.

Bawan, allegedly a short-tempered vagabond, was sheltered at the dabha by Jaiswal. Though Bawan was learnt to be working at the dhaba without any fixed salary, Jaiswal ensured that he got his meals and also a place to sleep apart from some pocket money on a daily basis.

According to sources, two persons from Madhya Pradesh Mahesh Iwnatey and Adharsingh Iwnatey , who worked till late at a brick-kiln in the vicinity and could not return home, had stayed at the dhaba for the night. While they and others were asleep, they woke up on hearing sudden commotion and witnessed Bawan hitting Jaiswal with a stick. They rushed to rescue Jaiswal but had to retreat as Bawan hit them also.

One of the guests fled the place and reached Deolapar police station, under Nagpur rural police, where Rameshwar Vithole, another worker at the dhaba, had also reached and narrated the incident.

The police rushed to the spot and found Jaiswal dead. They sent the body for post mortem and took Bawan into custody. Further investigations are on.

MUMBAI: In a reversal of a key decision it had taken recently, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government led by Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday scrapped the appointments of Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant and Sena MLA Ravindra Waikar to the posts of chairman of the Maharashtra state parliamentary coordination committee and chief coordinator in the Chief Minister’s Office respectively.The reversal came amid controversy that the appointments might get mired in an ‘office of profit’ row as both Waikar and Sawant had been given the rank of cabinet minister and would be entitled to a salary and perks. An elected representative cannot hold any other office of profit, so Waikar and Sawant could not really draw perks or salary as they are members of the state assembly and the Lok Sabha respectively, it was argued.The scrapping nullifies the Sena’s attempt to pacify the two senior party leaders (see graphic). The twin posts were in fact created in order to accommodate the two.According to a government resolution of February 20, the state has scrapped their appointments as they were not willing to take up the roles. TOI contacted Sawant and Waikar but both declined comment. Sources said BJP had decided to raise the issue, forcing the government to reverse its move to avoid embarrassment.Sena sources said a revised decision might be taken in Waikar’s case as there was not question of ‘office of profit’ in his case. “Waikar is an MLA, so there was no question of receiving a salary by the state.

Fresh violence erupted on Tuesday after a public gathering was organized near Tower Bazaar

VADODARA: Fresh violence broke out in the coastal town of Khambhat in Gujarat’s Anand district on Tuesday as a mob set a house and a shop ablaze in Mochiwad area of the town. No injuries were reported.

The fresh round of violence broke out after a public gathering was organised by ‘Hindu Samaj’ near Tower Bazaar area in the heart of Khambhat town.

Following the rioting, state home department transferred Anand superintendent of police Makrand Chauhan and Khambhat’s deputy SP Reema Munshi. Three police inspectors were also shunted with immediate effect by the DGP’s office.

‘Hindu Samaj’ had called a bandh on Monday following which shops and businesses in all markets of the town remained closed. A large number of people, however, joined the public gathering.

“The gathering was not organised by a social or political organisation. Residents of Bhavsarwad area, where rioters had looted around 25 households apart from damaging vehicles, had appealed to people to come out in support of those affected in the rioting,” said former BJP MLA from Khambhat Sanjay Patel. Patel, along with Khambhat city unit head of the BJP, Pinakin Brahmbhatt, was among those who addressed the gathering at Tower Bazaar.

“The bandh was voluntary. It was successful as shops, whether owned by Muslims or Hindus, remained close during the day,” said Patel.

The town has been on the boil since Sunday following communal clash between members of minority and Chunara communities in Akbarpura area. As the violence, which began in Akbarpura, spread to other parts of the town, around 30 houses and shops were set ablaze and about a dozen vehicles were damaged by rioters.

The town again witnessed violence late on Monday evening when a police party raided Lal Darwaza area to arrest residents wanted for Sunday’s communal clash. Around 15 cops were injured after a mob attacked them. One of the constables fractured his hand.

473,['26/02/2020'],Parties crunch nos. with 5 RS vacancies in Bengal,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Kolkata: Political parties are back in their war rooms strategizing the numbers game for the March 26 elections to five vacancies in Rajya Sabha (RS) from West Bengal.

BJP is far behind in the race because it doesn’t have adequate numbers. MLAs in the Bengal assembly are voters in RS polls.

As many as five members — Ritabrata Banerjee, K D Singh, Jogen Chowdhury, Manish Gupta and Hassan Ahmed — are retiring from the Upper House of Parliament on April 2. Going by the MLA count, ruling Trinamool is set to send four of its candidates to RS. Names of former Lok Sabha members Dinesh Trivedi and Mousam Noor are doing the rounds in Trinamool circles.

Speculation on several combinations such as Congress-Left, Congress-Trinamool is rife over the fifth candidate as RS elections involve proportional representation by means of single transferable vote.

The Bengal assembly now has 293 elected members following the demise of a member. The quota for getting elected for each candidate is thus 49 in terms of first preferential votes. Neither Congress nor Left has the numbers to win the fifth seat on its own. A section of Pradesh Congress and Left leaders thus prefer a common candidate.

The ground reality, however, is a little different. A host of Congress MLAs is allied with Trinamool. Now, if Trinamool fields the fifth candidate in consultation with Congress high command — as had happened earlier —chances are he/she may scrape through.

Some Left and Congress members want to prevent cross-voting by issuing party whips. They believe this will prevent vacillating MLAs from turning up to vote. Leader of the opposition Abdul Mannan left it to the Congress high command to take a call. “I will abide by the party’s decision,” he said.

Pradesh Congress chief Somen Mitra said: “I will have to initiate talks with them (Left) before we take a decision on the issue.”

Left legislature party leader Sujan Chakrabarty too prefers to wait for the CPM politburo meeting.

474,['26/02/2020'],101 lifers freed in West Bengal since December after serving 14 years,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Calcutta high court

KOLKATA: As many as 101 lifers have been released from Bengal prisons over the last 86 days since December 2019, the largest number freed in such a short span of time, as part of a bold reformative-justice plan.

Twenty-seven prisoners , including two women, were released on Tuesday, a move that helped Bengal cross the three-figure mark. Seventy-five more are exp-ected to be released again soon. The spike follows the Calcutta High Court ’s fast-tracking of a Supreme Court-mandated process that makes a court nod essential for early release of people serving life sentences.

The state can commute sentences under Sections 432 and 433 of the Criminal Procedure Code. But it can commute life sentences only after a convict has served at least 14 years.

The home secretary-chaired State Sentence Review Board reviews cases and recommends to the government prisoners found suitable for early release.

One hundred and ninety-three prisoners were released in the three-year period between 2010 and 2012. But the process underwent a change after a November 2012 apex court judgement by Justices KS Radhakrishnan and justice Madan B Lokur, which said state governments must obtain a court’s nod before exercising this power for life convicts.

Early-release numbers dropped significantly following this between 2013 and 2018; only seven were released early in a three-year period between 2016 and 2018.

This prompted the Calcutta HC to step in and expedite pending appeals and hold regular meetings with the state government, a senior government official said. This paved the way for the State Sentence Review Board. Forty-six life convicts were released following this process in December 2019; 28 more were released this January and 27 on Tuesday.

“The board has, among others, the state director-general of police and the Kolkata Police commissioner. One of the parameters taken into account is a convict’s conduct in prison,” the official told TOI. But a state government can revoke an early-release order; the convict then must return to prison.

475,['26/02/2020'],BJP to finalise civic manifesto during Shah’s Kolkata visit,"This story is from February 26, 2020

Kolkata: Bengal BJP is likely to draw up the party’s civic poll manifesto on March 1 when Union home minister Amit Shah comes to Kolkata for the Shahid Minar rally. Shah will meet “core committee” members after the rally to fine-tune BJP’s poll campaign.

While BJP supporters will be all ears for what Shah says on CAA and NRC following the violence in Delhi and the saffron party’s reverses in the Delhi assembly polls, political observers will watch out for former mayor Sovan Chatterjee. Chatterjee’s presence or absence in the rally will chart his role in the civic battle ahead, said BJP sources.

BJP leaders have set a tall target of mobilising supporters for Shah’s rally from Kolkata, Bidhannagar, Howrah, South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas, when the party doesn’t have a firm footing in the city, Howrah and South 24 Parganas.

“There is no denying that we are yet to make a mark in the city, though our support is increasing. We are concentrating on Kolkata, Howrah and South 24 Parganas for an impressive turnout at Shahid Minar,” said BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu.

Bengal BJP’s position is just the reverse of TMC’s formative days when Mamata Banerjee’s party had a strong presence in the city and the suburbs in south Bengal. BJP, on the contrary, has begun its journey in Bengal by springing a surprise in the districts, particularly in north Bengal and Jangalmahal. BJP made an impressive show last December when party president J P Nadda visited Kolkata.

Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is “deeply disturbed” over the continuing communal violence in Delhi.

“Ours is a country where we need to stay together. I am deeply disturbed. I am deeply concerned. I do not know what is going on there. We, the people of India, want peace. I appeal to all please restore peace,” the CM said at Kolkata airport before leaving for Bhubaneswar on Tuesday evening.

Banerjee also took stock of the law and order situation in sensitive areas and asked Kolkata Police to beef up vigilance in the city and its suburbs.

The CM has gone to Bhubaneswar to attend the February 28 meeting of the Eastern Zonal Council, to be presided over by Union home minister Amit Shah. The council, like other zones, is placed under the Union home ministry to promote cooperative federalism between the Centre and states. The zonal councils take up border issues, inter-state transport, emerging social issues across states and also the status of linguistic minorities. Chief ministers are members of the council. Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik is the vice-chairman of EZC.

Banerjee left three days ahead of the meeting because of other preoccupations. According to Nabanna sources, she is set to offer prayers at Jagannath temple in Puri on Tuesday and visit the Lingaraj temple the next day.

In the meantime, the Bengal CM may have a meeting with Patnaik, who has already said no to NRC.

Kolkata hosted the EZC meeting in 2018 with then Union home minister Rajnath Singh as chairman. The CMs of Bengal and Jharkhand were present.

Speaking at the 43rd session of the Human Rights Council which is being held in Switzerland from February 24 to March 20, Pakistan’s minister for human rights Shireen Mazari alleged that India continued to violate the human rights of the Kashmiri people and demanded the immediate repeal of all actions by India on August 5 last year in Kashmir.

She appealed the Council to constitute an independent commission of inquiry to investigate and report the alleged human rights violations in Kashmir as proposed in a UN report.

482,['26/02/2020'],"Bengaluru: First in 6 years, bus fares up 12%; BMTC spared","The fare revision will also affect passengers in rural areas as well as inter-city passengers

Fare hiked due to rising operational cost

KSRTC justifies move

BENGALURU: In a move that could impact lakhs of bus passengers, Karnataka government on Tuesday decided to increase fares by 12% effective Tuesday midnight — first hike in six years.In a relief to Bengalureans, the government spared Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation from fare revision. The revision is applicable to Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation, North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation and North Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation.The notification was signed by M Sathyavathi, undersecretary to the government (transport department).The fare revision will also affect passengers in rural areas as well as inter-city passengers. The move will also force many inter-city passengers to shift to trains, private vehicles and rental cabs.The rising operational cost is citied as the reason for the hike. Fares of state transport undertakings haven’t been revised since 2014. However, STUs in Karnataka still have one of the highest fares in the country. All of them are incurring heavy losses due to skyrocketing operational costs.STUs are spending about 50% of their outlay on staff wages and 30% on fuel costs. Statistics show at Rs 349.4 crore, BMTC suffered maximum financial loss in 2018-19, followed by KSRTC (Rs 134.9 crore), NWKRTC (Rs 89 crore) and NEKRTC (Rs 68.2 crore). Many of them have trimmed schedules to reduce losses.In November, chief minister BS Yediyurappa said the government would reduce bus fares of STUs to encourage people to use public transport. However, the CM recently backtracked on the promise.While a hike of 18% was announced in September 2018, it was reversed by then CM HD Kumaraswamy in under 30 minutes due to public backlash. All four STUs are hoping for a significant allocation in the budget to stem losses.Activists slammed the move to revise fares. Srinivas Alavilli of Citizens for Bengaluru, an NGO, said: “The move will encourage people to travel in unsafe modes as well as private vehicles, including twowheelers. This will severely affect people in smaller towns and their right to commute for education or to find jobs. The bus fares should be reasonable and should not encourage more private vehicles and traffic congestion.” He said BMTC fares should be reduced by 50% to make it affordable.KSRTC claimed it has taken steps to reduce the burden on rural passengers. “There is no increase of fares on passes issued to students and differently abled persons,” said a release. “In ordinary services, fare of first 3km has been reduced from Rs 7 to Rs 5 and for has not been increased for the first12 and15km. In express services, fare for the first 6km is the same,” it said.It stated there is a steep rise in high-speed diesel rates in the international market.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74310151,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-287666,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-first-in-6-years-bus-fares-up-12-bmtc-spared/articleshow/74310146.cms
