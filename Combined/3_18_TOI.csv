1,['18/03/2020'],Ever considered a voluntary career as Bengaluru's bicycle councillor?,"It looks like Bengaluru is ready to up its game, as far as bicycling is concerned. Plans are afoot to introduce the concept of bicycle councillors who will help make our city more cycle friendly.So far, the authorities have done their bit to spread awareness about the advantages of cycling. But just awareness on the matter does not seem to be doing the trick.“Over the last six years, there have been rallies, awareness programmes and even as many as 500 cycle days that have been organised in the city. But we realise we need macro-level programmes to get everyone’s attention. This concept of introducing cycle councillors is the first of its kind in the country, and probably the first in the world too,” explains Sathya Sankaran, the Bicycle Mayor of Bengaluru, of the programme that was recently announced by Deputy Chief Minister CN Ashwath Narayan.“With bicycle councillors, we hope to be able to move beyond the concept of awareness and into a more solutions and action-oriented system. There are 198 wards in the city and each councillor will be required to analyse what it would take to make their wards cycling friendly. They will then engage with BBMP and other civic authorities and come up with solutions. They will also be required to adhere to a set of goals — the main one being to increase the number of cyclists on our roads by 20% by the year 2030. Councillors need to come up with innovative and achievable plans to help achieve this goal,” he explains.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74673950,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-765157/74673950.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/ever-considered-a-voluntary-career-as-a-bicycle-councillor/articleshow/74673950.cms
2,['18/03/2020'],Kerala campuses give saris a dhoti makeover,"Campuses have always been on the lookout for cool new ways to drape saris. Guess what’s the latest style that has won over Kerala colleges? The dhoti style! Be it in reunions, college fests, dance programmes or random events, girls can be seen pulling off this look with ease, pairing it up with shirts, jackets, long tops, what not. And the girls tell us why they love the style so much.

‘Gives traditional sari look an unconventional twist’

Ramzana Sulfikar

B Com third year student

National College of Arts and Science, Thiruvananthapuram

As a hijabi, I love the dhoti style in sari as I always get the compliment, ‘You look like Aladdin’s princess in this look.’ I try it with belts, trendy shirts, bell-bottomed blouse (the ones with huge sleeves) and more. I also love to complete the look with a good pair of shades, which gives the traditional sari look a totally unconventional twist.

‘Keeps the sari in place’

Kripa Anna Cherian

Architecture third year student

Marian College of Architecture and Planning, Thiruvananthapuram

All you need is a comfy pants or leggings to try this sari style! It keeps the sari in place, and can even style it with chunky boots, large chain statement necklaces and more. I had worn in on our college day and the look helped me win our fashion show too!

‘Its vibe changes with the material you pick’

Rukmini Shafi

BHM second year student

Lourdes Matha Institute of Hotel Management and Catering Technology, Thiruvananthapuram

The dhoti style gives saris a different kind of elegance and vibe, as per the material one picks. In traditional functions, it looks best in crop tops or those with embroidery. For a modern look, one can pick offbeat colours or accessorize saris with hoop earrings, bangles and the like. I like to wear polka dot saris in dhoti style with a good hair band or bow, which gives a classy vintage look.

‘I learnt the style from Youtube in five minutes’

Thazneem.L

Second year diploma student

Government Commerce Institute, Thiruvananthapuram

The dhoti style might look complicated, but infact, I learnt to drape it like this in five minutes! Personally, I like to exude a gypsy attitude and love it when my clothes reflect it. While the usual sari look doesn’t give it, dhoti style nails it. And what’s more, you can grab any sari and get into the look. I would say it’s the coolest look in 2020.

Their directorial debuts — the Hindi film Uri: The Surgical Strike and the Malayalam movie Kumbalangi Nights respectively — went on to impress both the critics and the audiences alike, and also set the cash registers ringing. This year, the films continue their winning streak by landing the filmmakers the Gollapudi Srinivas National Award 2019. Reportedly, this is the first time that two directors have jointly won the Best Debut Director honour.“It’s one of highest honours for any debutant director. I feel truly honoured to receive the award. Considering that I’m sharing it with Madhu is amazing because he is a brilliant talent. I feel honoured and humbled,” says Aditya, who recently won the National Award for the Best Director for the Vicky Kaushal-starrer Uri.Madhu adds, “This is a national-level award, and a prestigious one. When I was told I’d won it this year, I was quite excited and even watched videos of the previous editions.”Both of them have fond memories of Chennai, and tell us that they can’t wait to be back here again. “One of my gurus, Priyan sir (director Priyadarshan) is based out of Chennai. Of course, it’s been really long since I came down there, but it’s my most favourite city in the country. I’m looking forward to being there again,” Aditya says.“I used to frequent Chennai as an assistant director because most of our film-related work used to happen here.

As we try to combat the deadly virus that’s spreading fast, unprecedented lifestyle changes all around us seem to be the norm. In a span of a few weeks, everyone has learnt new hashtags that are going to stay with us for lives —- #COVID19, #CoronaVirus, and #SocialDistancing. The last hashtag has emerged as the best bet to beat the virus, as people withdraw into their homes, and mass congregation places like malls, theatres, parks, etc have been locked down upon government order.

But what happens to those things that we all, till now, used to do without a second thought? Like going to the salon for a haircut or facial? These are close contact places and hotbeds for spreading the virus. But salon owners in the state aver they’re ready and all prepped to deal with this, though some moan the dip in business.

SANITISING IS PRIORITY

“I have made it mandatory to disinfect all our salons either after every use, or on an hourly basis,” says Sam Paul of the Toni and Guy chain of salons. “We wipe down chairs, countertops and the entrance door after every hour/every use with disinfectants. Every person in the salon has to wear a mask and gloves when servicing customers and we’ve also begun handing out free masks and sanitisers to our customers.”

“All the implements used are electronically sanitised — this is a standard procedure at our place, but now, we have intensified monitoring this process. We are trying to get temperature screens installed across all our salons at the earliest,” adds Sam.

Muthu Kumar, hairstylist from B Blunt Nungambakkam, adds, “We’re much more cautious when we work with clients now. We anyway use hand sanitiser when men and women come for haircuts, but now, we’ve made it mandatory for the clients to wash their hands, and use sanitiser. Scissors, combs and other hair cutting instruments are usually washed and sterilised after every service, but now, we are ultra-careful about not leaving them lying outside.”

Celebrity makeup artiste, Ibrahim, says that working with gloves on gets uncomfortable. “But I will wear a mask. We generally wash our hands before and after every service and carry a hand sanitiser. We do a shampoo of the brushes immediately after every use, and sponges, powder pads, lashes, etc., are use and throw.”

Veena Kumaravel of Naturals tells us how her chain of parlours are being cleaned thoroughly and the equipment, chairs, and floors are being disinfected periodically. “We’ve been sterilising the instruments right in front of the customers for the last one week. We’ve stopped threading service since there is a risk of the beautician breathing into the face of the customer. We’re ensuring that our staff is not put at risk, too. We’ve been screening them for the last one week for symptoms. We have advised our staff to be extra cautious with customers who have returned from abroad. The staff are asked to wear gloves and masks for pedicures and manicures,” she adds.

Manoj Samuel from Vurve Signature Salon, says, “We’re taking every step to ensure staff and customers stay safe. We’ve told the staff to take a day off and consult a doctor if they aren’t feeling okay. We’ve asked them to avoid eating outside/ ordering food from outside. Salon kits are cleaned with alcohol swabs after each use and put in a UV box. We’ve moved from fragrance-based solutions to disinfectants for cleaning the floors and we’ve told our valets to wear gloves and masks since they handle cars of different customers.”

Travel Woes of Celebrity makeup artistes

For Ibrahim, travelling is a big worry. “I have a wedding makeup booked for March 21 & 22 in Tirupur and Erode, respectively. This was booked some time ago, and I can’t cancel; the client, too, checked with me as to whether I would be able to make it. So, I will be driving down. Actually, for makeup artistes, travelling via flight is anyway an exhausting procedure. The number of products and implements we carry usually requires multiple security checks. Since both the weddings are in Tamil Nadu, I will be taking my car and I don’t risk catching the virus,” he adds. Manoj Samuel, who owns salons, tells us they’ve been making discreet inquiries about whether the customer has travelled abroad. “When they call to fix appointments, we tell them in a friendly way that they can reschedule if they are feeling unwell. It’s a bit sensitive but important to let them know,” says Manoj.

Beauty Business is down

Freelancer Abhirami, who does salon services at clients’ homes, says that she wants to do a self-quarantine of sorts and reduce the number of clients she takes on till this COVID-19 threat is over. “Since I do all services, including threading and waxing, I come in close contact with the customer. I use gloves and masks to be on the safe side now, but I try not to take too many clients at the moment, as it’s not safe,” she says. “Not as much as I had predicted, but there has been a 25-30% dip in business,” says Sam. Muthu, however, says “Clients keep coming in as usual,” while Veena says, “The parlours at the malls are closed, and the footfall at the standalone ones has come down.” Manoj says that there’s certainly a dip in the number of clients walking in for the last one week. “Even as the best hygienic practices are followed, between the two cities — Bangalore and Chennai — where we have our salons, we’ve seen a steep dip in Bangalore so far. We presume it's because people have been working from home since last week there. We’ve to see how things turn out in Chennai, now,” he adds.

It’s better to do beauty treatments at home

I’m letting my hair grow; the rest of the things can be easily taken care of at home for us, men. I told my wife to get her beauty things from the cosmetics shop and do them at home — anyway both of us are grounded as the MNCs we have been working for has asked us to work from home. So time pass ke liye achcha hai — she can put on a face mask and still do Tally

—Rupesh Shah, an IT professional from OMR

I’m going for a clean-shaven look

Maintaining a beard is a task and frequent salon visits are a must. I now think a clean-shaven look is the best to avoid going to a salon for a while. I know I am going to look a bit unrecognisable once I shave off the beard – I’ve kept one for a long while, now. But I’ll blame it on #Coronascare. No matter how careful you are, you never know how hygienic the salon equipment are when customers keep walking in.

- Ashish Kumar, a youngster from Kotturpuram

Try homemade remedies

I went to a parlour on Harrington Road yesterday, and the lady refused to thread my eyebrows and upper lips. They’ve begun to use an epilator, now. The parlour girls usually hold one end of the thread in their mouth, and I immediately cursed myself for not figuring this out myself. So, spreading the word for other women — do not go for threading to the parlours, even if they haven’t stopped it by themselves. Try tweezing at home — ditto for other beauty treatments. Try homemade remedies

7,['18/03/2020'],"Abin Abraham: I wish to be an international sportsman and a teacher, in the future","Abin loved playing cricket and sports since childhood. Following a surgery in 2011 when he was 14, the Kochi boy was paralysed down the right side, and even lost his memory and ability to speak for a few months.

But the braveheart has since slowly started regaining his abilities, though the right wrist and foot remain paralysed. The youngster, has not given up and tries to be as active as he can.

In the recently concluded State Para Athletics Championship that was held in Kochi, Abin, who is a first-time participant, came first in 1500 m, 100 m and long jump. The final year MCom student of Sacred Heart College , Thevara, tells us how he turned his disabilities into strengths.

“I couldn’t speak much after the surgery and have faced many issues because of it, but I used to be involved with social service activities. That’s where I met renowned para badminton player Neeraj George Baby,” says Abin, who is called ‘Abin Chill’ by friends, for his positive attitude. He explains, “He motivated me to practice para badminton and as took part in a badminton tournament selection. That’s where I met Fr Mathew Kiriyantha, who is the State Para Sports president. Following his encouragement I took part in the State Athletic Championship.” The athlete is now gearing up for his first national championship as well, which is scheduled to be held in Mysore in April. As he is a first-time participant, Abin does not have much-needed sponsorship to go for the event. “As my final year exam coincides with the preparations, I couldn’t try hard to get sponsorship,” says the sportsman.

While his prizes in the championship are for track events, Abin says, “Para badminton is my first love and that’s what I regularly practice. I am an SL3 category player. I am also a fan of players like Neeraj and P V Sindhu, and wish to be an international player someday. I also want a career and be independent, and love teaching profession the best.”

12,['18/03/2020'],Ever considered a voluntary career as Bengaluru's bicycle councillor?,"It looks like Bengaluru is ready to up its game, as far as bicycling is concerned. Plans are afoot to introduce the concept of bicycle councillors who will help make our city more cycle friendly.

So far, the authorities have done their bit to spread awareness about the advantages of cycling. But just awareness on the matter does not seem to be doing the trick.

“Over the last six years, there have been rallies, awareness programmes and even as many as 500 cycle days that have been organised in the city. But we realise we need macro-level programmes to get everyone’s attention. This concept of introducing cycle councillors is the first of its kind in the country, and probably the first in the world too,” explains Sathya Sankaran , the Bicycle Mayor of Bengaluru , of the programme that was recently announced by Deputy Chief Minister CN Ashwath Narayan.

“With bicycle councillors, we hope to be able to move beyond the concept of awareness and into a more solutions and action-oriented system. There are 198 wards in the city and each councillor will be required to analyse what it would take to make their wards cycling friendly. They will then engage with BBMP and other civic authorities and come up with solutions. They will also be required to adhere to a set of goals — the main one being to increase the number of cyclists on our roads by 20% by the year 2030. Councillors need to come up with innovative and achievable plans to help achieve this goal,” he explains.

The latest case in Pune is of a 26-year-old man who also returned from the US on March 14.Civic officials said the senior citizen from Mumbai who died on Tuesday had high blood pressure, which, combined with inflammation of the heart muscles and an increased heart rate, contributed to his death.

22,['18/03/2020'],"Sensex sheds 811 pts, Nifty closes below 9k 1st time in 3 years","MUMBAI: The markets see-sawed on Tuesday as fears of a pandemic-led global recession kept investors jittery. Local institutions tried to support the sensex at lower levels but eventually failed. The index opened about 200 points higher, lost 800 points within the first hour, then rallied nearly 500 points but finally, due to a fag-end selloff, settled with a loss of 811 points, or 2.6%, at 30,579 — a three-year closing low. On the NSE, the Nifty lost 230 points, or 2.5%, to 8,967, its first closing below the 9K mark in the last three years.

The day’s selling was again led by foreign funds with a net outflow figure of Rs 4,045 crore, BSE data showed. Banking and financial services stocks were again at the forefront of the sell-off with ICICI Bank (down 9%), IndusInd Bank (8.9%) and Bajaj Finance (6.3%) among the top sensex laggards. Of the 30 sensex stocks, nine closed higher with HUL (up 3.5%) and Hero MotoCorp (3.1%) leading. The day’s selling also left investors poorer by Rs 2.1 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now almost at Rs 119 lakh crore.

With each passing the day, as the epidemic spreads across the world and market after market enters bear territory, the chances of a recession are growing. A report by global financial services major Morgan Stanley on Tuesday said the fallout was likely to trigger a global recession.

“With Covid-19 spreading in Europe and the US after hitting Asia, the disruptions and dislocations in the economy and markets will trigger a year-on-year contraction in global growth in the first half of 2020. However, the strong monetary and fiscal policy response under way will help to revive global growth from the third quarter of 2020,” the report said.

On Monday night, the Dow Jones index in the US had lost nearly 13%, its biggest rout in more than 30 years. In early trades on Tuesday, the UK and German markets were also deep in the red but recovered in late trades as the US markets rallied over 3% after opening. In India, too, the VIX, a gauge of volatility, reached a current peak of 63.4, NSE data showed.

Market players feel the volatility will continue for a while. According to Pankaj Bobade , head (fundamental research), Axis Securities, “Markets are expected to be volatile in the near term given the rise in new reported cases is outside mainland China than inside, marking a new milestone in the evolution of the global pandemic. As cases blow up in Europe and North America, fear is growing in Asia of the possibility of a second wave of infections from imported cases, which is driving risk aversion in markets globally.”

Railways also advised all divisional railway managers on Tuesday to hike the price of platform tickets from Rs 10 to Rs 50 at important stations to prevent crowding.

Ministry officials said they were assessing the extent of cancellations even as they appealed to passengers “to avoid non-essential train journeys”. The ministry urged passengers to ensure they are not running a fever before commencing their journeys. An internal assessment done last week had found that the share of cancellation of confirmed tickets had increased from 17% to 30%.

Central Railway announced cancellation or reduced the frequency of 23 long-distance trains followed by South Central Railway (17 trains). Some of the trains that won’t operate from Wednesday include Mumbai-Pune Deccan Express , Howrah-Mumbai Duranto Express and Rajdhani Express from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus to New Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin .

says the risk is very high even in India and a shift in testing strategy will be needed. Asserting that testing and isolating is critical, Singh tells Sushmi Dey that it is encouraging to see India’s efforts being led by the highest political leadership. Excerpts:

Positive cases of COVID-19 are increasing rapidly. How serious is the situation in your view?

Do you think India is on the right track as far as its strategy is concerned?

Do you think there is a need for India to move towards

testing now?

What are the measures required to tackle community transmission?

What is the possibility of community transmission in India, especially now that cases are increasing fast?

Do you think there is a need for lockdown in India?

Is India adequately equipped to handle the situation in case of an epidemic here?

How effective are the two anti-HIV drugs in treatment? Do you recommend their use?

How is the

related situation evolving in the region? Which are the countries doing better and do you expect cases to increase in near term?

What is the update on vaccine against coronavirus?

The risk of COVID-19 globally, including India, is very high. WHO is deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of global spread and severity of the disease. As of this morning, well over 1,60,000 cases have been reported from over 150 countries . These numbers have increased manifold in recent weeks, prompting WHO to characterise COVID-19 as a pandemic.It is very encouraging to see India’s efforts being led by the highest political leadership who continue to review the situation, preparedness and response. The country has been responding to the evolving situation. WHO has recommendations for countries preparing for the first case, the first cluster and community transmission and India’s containment plan is in line with it.India has been testing suspected cases and contacts of confirmed cases. We are aware that laboratory capacities have been augmented with many more laboratories now collecting samples. As the situation evolves a shift in the testing strategy will be needed. Now that countries report more cases as well as clusters, WHO recommends scaling up measures to detect, test, treat, isolate and trace contacts. Testing and isolating is critical to break the virus transmission.A: Community transmission means the source of infection is from the community as opposed to households or health facilities. As such the source is unclear. It requires a whole of society approach, where everyone has a role to play if transmission is to be slowed. To slow down transmission, everyone needs to practice hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, and physical distancing from other people. Surveillance needs to be ramped up...For the sick, care needs to be prioritsed, with triage procedures activated.The situation is evolving rapidly. From the onset, WHO has been recommending all countries to prepare for the first cases of importation, first cluster as well as community transmission – with the risk of all three being real in all countries.Every country makes its own decision in terms of evolution of the outbreak and should decide to implement the most appropriate measures adapted to the local contexts. In particular, we encourage citizens to follow guidance from health authorities and reach out to support others. Practicing social distancing has been found to be effective to slow down transmission. Policies such as working from home can alleviate crowding in offices and public transport, and cut down risk of virus spread.WHO has been recommending all countries to scale-up emergency response mechanism. India has been taking measures which are effective in the current context. As the situation evolves, the country would need to scale up accordingly.So far, we have no evidence that any drug is effective. There are no specific treatments for this Covid-19 and treatment is based on clinical presentation. WHO recommends enrolling into a randomised controlled trial to test efficacy and safety of interventions. A master global clinical trial protocol for research and prioritisation of therapeutics is ongoing at WHO.Countries in the region are at various stages of response. While Thailand, Indonesia and India are dealing with clusters of transmission, there are also countries like Bhutan and Nepal with one case of importation and countries who are yet to get any case.So far WHO has received applications for review and approval of 40 diagnostic tests, 20 vaccines are in development and many clinical trials of therapeutics are underway. We expect the first results in a few weeks.Vaccines usually take several years. We were able to shorten that in the development to the vaccine for Ebola by harnessing global efforts. We are already working to do the same for COVID-19.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74682477,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-120370,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/encouraging-to-see-indias-efforts-being-led-by-highest-political-leadership/articleshow/74682473.cms

The victim, a Class IX student of a local government school, was attacked by her tormentor, Sudhanshu Kumar and his accomplices in her house around 8 am on Monday. She later succumbed to injuries. The deceased’s mother, younger brother and sister were also assaulted by the attackers when they tried to rescue her.

The deceased’s mother told police that Sudhanshu often used to harass her teenage daughter whenever she used to go to her coaching institute. On Monday also, Sudhanshu accosted and passed lewd comments. When she returned home from her coaching classes, Sudhanshu reached her house and started harassing her again. He also attacked her with a sharp substance when she resisted the molestation bid.

The victim’s family alleged that the Sarai police did not initiate action against the culprits and provided enough time to them to escape after committing the crime. “A sub-inspector of police from the Sarai police station spent almost half-an-hour inside the house of the accused and left the spot without making any arrest,” the deceased’s uncle Ajay Mishra said.

On getting information, DSP (Sadar) Raghav Dalay along with the SHO of Sarai police station Dharmajeet Mahto reached the site and removed the road blockade. The DSP said that two accused—Gudia Devi and Chhoti Kumari—have been arrested in connection with the incident. Other accused are absconding after the incident, the SHO said.

Altogether 11 persons have been made named accused in the FIR lodged with the Sarai police station. The SHO said the victim had not lodged any complaint against the tormentor earlier. “Raids are on to nab the culprits,” he said. The incident has sparked off tension in the village.

Though their numbers were less compared to other Tuesdays.This was in sharp contrast with many famous shrines in the country, including Mumbai's Siddhivinayak Temple and Ujjain’s Baba Mahakal temple, which have been closed. Shirdi Saibaba Temple in Maharashtra was also shut for devotees on Tuesday.However, in Patna, the famous Mahavir temple near Patna Junction and Durga temple near Patna museum witnessed huge gatherings on Tuesday despite government advisory not to gather at one place in large numbers.Though many people were seen wearing masks, but the advisory related to social distancing was hardly being followed as people stood very close to each other, ignoring other precautions.Temple authorities, on the other hand, claimed they have taken several precautionary measures in order to stop the spread of the virus. “The temple premises is being cleaned with water and disinfectants and people as well as shrine management staff are being asked to wash their hands at regular intervals,” said Harikant Prasad, who looks after bookings for rituals at Mahavir Mandir.Prasad, however, said the number of devotees had reduced substantially over the last few days, but it increased on Tuesday. “Though more devotees came on Tuesday but their number was still less as compared to other Tuesdays in the past,” he said.Arvind Pandey, a priest at Khajpura Shiva temple also made similar claims with regard to devotee footfalls. “The number of people coming to the temple has definitely reduced over the past few days. In fact, very few people came to the temple even last Sunday, despite it being a holiday. Though the footfall increased on Tuesday, it was still comparatively lower than Tuesdays in the past,” he said.Hari Gopal, the priest at Durga Temple near Golghar, said liquid soaps for handwash has been introduced in the shrine and the devotees are asked to wash their hands with it before entering the temple premises. “We have started providing handwash to the devotees as preventive measure to curb the spread of Covid-19. The number of people coming to the temple has plunged but it surged slightly on Tuesday,” he said.Devotees, on the other hand, claimed that they exercised caution in visiting the temples.

34,['18/03/2020'],Trustees to HC: 20% of Yes Bank AT-1 bonds can be made equity,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Debenture trustees on Tuesday argued before the Bombay high court that at least 20% of the additional tier-1 ( AT-1 ) bonds issued by Yes Bank may be converted into equity. They also said that any decision on a write-off can only be taken by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) and not by the Yes Bank administrator.

Janak Dwarkadas, counsel for Axis Trustee Services, submitted that the final restructuring scheme as notified by the RBI, in fact, did not provide for any write-off. More significantly, the court was informed that the write-off would adversely impact many senior citizens. Many bonds were held by senior citizens who had put their entire life’s savings in it. One of them — a cancer patient — put in savings on the promise of good returns which were to be used for treatment, said Dwarkadas and lawyer Zal Andhyarujina.

Provident funds and pension funds also have invested in the AT-1 bonds. Individual bond holders had also come to court, some wearing masks, some too preoccupied with the worry of losing all their savings. One is a nonagenarian, represented by her children in court. Another couple, both senior citizens, had invested Rs 70 lakh in the bonds.

Others had broken their fixed deposits and invested in the bonds on the promise of earning 9.5% returns. “Many of us are senior citizens who have invested a substantial part of lifetime savings, which are now on the verge of getting lost,” said one retired engineer who was in court.

As a preventive measure in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the HC from Tuesday restricted working hours from noon till 2 pm. As a result, time ran out for the hearing and the HC will continue it on Wednesday. It continued its interim order passed on Monday, which subjects any decision in the controversy to court orders.

Dwarkadas said it was the trustees’ Rs 8,400-odd crore that helped the bank too. While the trustees understand the issue of “capital adequacy” for the new investees when SBI steps in, he wondered why should the bank’s promoters get the benefit of equity when it goes up as “existing investors” like Axis Trustee are made to suffer. He said, “AT-1 should have equity to the extent of 20%...we are willing to sail along with fortunes of other equity holders and willing to go with the lock-in period of three years.”

Along with Axis Trustee, Indiabulls Housing Finance also has filed a separate writ petition before the HC to challenge the March 14 notification issued by the Yes Bank administrator, where AT-1 capital bonds have been permanently written down in full.

The notification by the administrator was despite ongoing discussions between the debenture holders and the RBI, and the removal of the clause writing down of the bonds in the final reconstruction scheme, they said.

35,['18/03/2020'],"To stop overcrowding, TTD introduces time-slot darshan system in Tirumala","Devotees can present any government-approved photo identity card to avail the darshan tokens

TIRUPATI: The dip in the number of devotees visiting Tirumala due to the coronavirus outbreak has forced the TTD to make time-slot darshan mandatory from this week. The temple body, which has already initiated measures to avoid overcrowding of devotees in queues and inside the temple, has now made time slots mandatory for devotees under the free darshan system. Sanitation exercises at various pilgrim congregation points in Tirumala have also been intensified.

TTD EO Anil Kumar Singhal said devotees can avail their time-slot based free darshan tokens at special counters set up at Srinivasam complex, TTD choultries, Galigopuram at Alipiri pedestrian route and Srivari mettu trekking routes leading to Tirumala. Two more counters have been set up at central reservation complex and at the RTC bus stand in Tirumala.

Devotees can present any government-approved photo identity card to avail the darshan tokens. Starting Tuesday, free darshan devotees will no longer have to wait in compartments at the Vaikuntam Q complex, but can join the queues at the temple as per the time slot allotted to them.

Meanwhile, pressure has been mounting on the TTD to impose further curbs on movement of devotees due to the spike in the number of positive cases across the country. The Shirdi Sai Sansthan has already announced the closure of the shrine at Shirdi in Maharashtra from Tuesday. Many other religious bodies across the country are also mulling similar moves.

Though no positive cases have been reported in the district so far, the spread of the virus from migrant devotees looms large. The TTD administers the affairs of nearly 29 temples in Chittoor district alone, including the Venkateswara temple in Tirumala, which continues to register a footfall of nearly 50,000 devotees per day despite the coronavirus fears.

Rayalaseema Porata Samithi convener P Naveen Kumar Reddy said while a few weekly sevas at the Tirumala temple have been cancelled, the temple continues to allow devotees to take part in daily arjitha sevas and some weekly sevas, where they sit in close proximity. “Though TTD has set up screening centres at Alipiri and Srivari mettu, it’s not possible to screen every single devotee . Only those with symptoms of cough or cold are being screened. The TTD should impose curbs on entry of devotees for all arjitha sevas held inside the temple till the corona scare settles down. Till then, the sevas can be performed by the priests in ekantham,” he advised.

MADURAI: Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry has condemned the union government for increasing excise duty and taxes on fuel instead of passing on the benefits of drop in crude oil price in the international market. “No wonder suspicion spawns among all whether the problems and predicaments faced by the people in succession are self-generated or forced by the Central government,” the statement said.

Chamber president N Jegatheesan and secretary J Selvam stated that the special excise duty hike on petrol and diesel has added to the woes for the industry and the people such as stagnation of the economy, Covid-19, rising unemployment, stock market crash and weakening Indian rupee. The ongoing tussle between Russia and Saudi Arabia has multiplied production of crude oil and reflected in a steep fall in crude oil price in the international markets. “Under these circumstances, everyone expected the price of diesel and petrol to be reduced by at least by Rs 10 per litre in India,” Jegatheesan said.

The equipment detects alcohol when someone blows into it after taking its nozzle inside the mouth.Same equipment is used on several people for detecting if he or she had consumed alcohol or not. That has a higher probability of coming into direct contact with the pathogen if any infected person had blown into it.Since there is prohibition on the use of liquor in Bihar, the equipment is also used to arrest those who are found in an inebriated state. Besides, the stern prohibition law has provision of arresting someone just on positive reading of a breathalyser.When contacted, ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar told TOI over phone that no such specific direction, in terms of yes or no, has been issued to officers regarding the use of breathalysers. “But instructions have been issued to respond according to the present situation,” he said. Kumar said the final call on breathalysers would be taken by the transport department.When asked on the issue, transport minister Santosh Kumar Nirala also avoided a reply and said transport secretary would take a call.When contacted, transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the equipment is mainly used by the police department and not by the transport department. “There is IG (prohibition) in police department to take a call on such issues.

HYDERABAD: A family of a four-year-old girl, who was allegedly raped by a chef of a private college, accused the educational institute of offering them money to leave the city. The college has denied the claim.

On March 10, the 32-year-old chef allegedly sexually assaulted the four-year-old. He was subsequently arrested and charged for rape and relevant sections of the POCSO Act.

Shankar (name changed) from West Bengal migrated to Hyderabad with his wife and four-year-old daughter a month ago.

“One of our known people asked us to work at Sri Chaitanya IIT Academy, Madhapur, a residential institution. My wife and I do odd jobs there, including sweeping the floor or help the cook in the kitchen,” Shankar added.

“On March 10, my wife asked the daughter to go out of our tenement but she did not come back for a while. Later, she found her scared and noticed she was bleeding,” the father added.

They approached the college management. “We supported the family. Handed over the accused to police. He was a chef here, both the accused and the family were staying at the servants’ quarters. A case was registered,” a representative of Sri Chaitanya Junior College, Madhapur, said.

According to the family, the college intervened in the case. “They did not even let us speak to police. They feared their reputation will be damaged. Now, they have offered us Rs 10,000 and asked us to leave the city. How can I forget what happened? My daughter still wakes up at night saying ‘uncle will come again!,” the man said.

However, the college denied the allegation. “We intervened because both the parties were our employees, it was our responsibility. Though we had asked the family to come and talk to us, they were missing from their quarters since Sunday. We have not offered them any money,” an official of the junior college said.

Deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Madhapur, A Venkateshwar Rao said the 32-year-old accused was arrested on March 10.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

He added that SBI would not sell a single share of the private lender for three years.Rajnish’s assurance comes a day before the bank lifts restrictions on depositors for withdrawal. The Reserve Bank of India-imposed moratorium will be lifted on Wednesday at 6pm. “Our ATMs are filled with cash and our branches have an adequate supply of cash. There is no need to depend on any external sources for liquidity requirement. But if that is the case, liquidity lines are adequately available,” said Prashant Kumar , the RBI-appointed administrator of the bank.According to Prashant, there are good signs of customer confidence in the bank. “Only a third of our customers withdrew deposits up to the Rs 50,000 limit available under the moratorium. Also, in the last few days, we were having higher inflows than outflows,” he said.Yes Bank, which raised Rs 10,000 crore from SBI and others this week, said it would raise more funds in the next quarter. Rajnish said that while SBI had applied for shares worth Rs 7,250 crore, it was issued only Rs 6,050 crore worth because of the ceiling of 49% under the reconstruction scheme. The SBI chief said that the fund-raising was limited to seven banks other than SBI with an objective of lifting the moratorium early. He said that getting the requisite permissions for foreign investors would have taken longer.While Yes Bank would engage in a second round of capital-raising, this will happen at market rates according to a Sebi formula. Yes Bank’s shares closed at Rs 59 on Tuesday against the Rs 10-per-share investment by the SBI-led lenders.SBI has nominated its two deputy MDs — chief creditor officer Partha Pratim Sengupta, and strategy & chief digital officer Swaminathan Janakiraman — to the board of the bank. SBI’s former chief finance officer Prashant, who is currently the RBI-appointed administrator, will take charge as CEO after a week when the new board is in place.The private-sector bank plans to shift focus to retail, both in terms of deposits and loans, and is looking at increasing the share of retail loans to 60% from the present level of 40%. The SBI chairman said that there were no plans to rebrand the private lender, which is now an associate of SBI. He pointed out that all of SBI’s arms have done very well financially.Under the reconstruction scheme, the employees, barring senior management, are assured continuity for a year.

46,['18/03/2020'],Paytm moves to Visa from RuPay,"Mumbai: Paytm Payments Bank , the largest issuer of RuPay debit cards, said that it will now issue Visa cards and is targeting one crore of these next year.

The move comes in the wake of the government barring banks from recovering any fees from merchants accepting RuPay cards.

According to bankers, the government’s decision to have zero merchant discount rate ( MDR , or merchant fees) on RuPay cards has caused loss to issuers. The card issuers were providing several benefits like cashback and lounge access to promote usage, which were funded by the merchant fees.

“For the first time, the bank’s customers will also be able to make international transactions using their Visa debit cards. Soon, the customers will also have an option to request for a physical card. This will enable customers to make contactless payment through their chip-inserted cards,” Paytm said in a statement.

“This partnership will allow millions of our customers to avail the benefits of Visa debit cards along with the power to make international transactions,” said Paytm Payments Bank MD & CEO Satish Kumar Gupta. Paytm has issued over 57 million digital debit cards through its mobile banking app.

Commenting on the partnership, Visa’s India chief T R Ramachandran said that debit cards, because of their ease of use, were the first choice of customers who are new to banking. “Debit cards play a critical role to migrate these customers to the digital economy and help them make non-cash transactions,” he said.

The company in question couldn’t postpone the interview for the critical role, but hiring firms are witnessing postponements in assignments across other levels. CIEL HR Services CEO Aditya Narayan Mishra said last week there was a significant 20% drop in normal hiring activities. “This week, the decline could be slightly more and, over the next three weeks, it would be crucial to see whether hiring activities could slow down. It all depends on the extent of the Covid-19 spread,” said Mishra.“The challenge is that a lot of our clients are working from home and decisions on hiring are taken jointly with multiple rounds of interviews. They usually sit across the table and decide on which candidate to choose. Since this cannot be done, hiring is taking a beating. Video interviews are usually done for senior-level hiring only,” he said.Sectors like logistics, travel & tourism and hospitality, which are deeply impacted by the spread of coronavirus, account for around 15% to overall hiring in India. “These sectors are in a panic mode right now, with hiring plans postponed or put on hold,” said Mishra.According to Antal International India MD Joseph Devasia, 80% of the interviews for the firm stand cancelled or postponed, with some moving to video calls. “Wherever the interviews are moving to ‘non-personal’ or digital mode, it’s only for the first couple of rounds. In the final round, companies prefer to meet candidates personally,” said Devasia. Not all hiring firms are facing the heat. Randstad India MD & CEO Paul Dupuis said the firm is not seeing hiring going into a freeze. “Hiring is either going virtual or being rescheduled to another day,” said Dupuis. He added that the company’s move to invest in leveraging technology has enabled the firm to provide services to clients and even on-board virtually.“On any normal day, our offices are filled with candidates registering and interviewing with us for both temporary and permanent staffing. Today, we are doing this virtually in some centres and the conversion rates have been higher than usual,” said Dupuis.TeamLease Services executive VP & co-founder Rituparna Chakraborty said, “With over 2 lakh associates of TeamLease Services in outbound jobs, life moves on for us even in these times of coronavirus pandemic.” Three out of 10 firms have postponed hiring assignments for TeamLease for now and they are expected to issue fresh dates, perhaps once things become more clear.“We only see a handful of firms saying that they want to schedule interviews digitally. For the larger section of mass hiring drives that we conduct, digital interviews are unproductive.

48,['18/03/2020'],"Leaders must unlearn, reskill to keep pace with change","By Shailja Dutt

It would be fair to call our slow economic growth a cyclical as well as structural slowdown. The nation is performing well below its growth potential, and lagging. The short-term decline in the economic sentiment could be balanced out by the compounding of small but far reaching changes for the simplification and modernisation of Indian economic systems and market practices. However, the long-term effects of hyper-capitalisation are challenging organisations to be bigger, better and faster.

The 2020 Budget has us all strapped in for fast executions, disguised as pre-planned and board-approved successes. Indian businesses are in critical need of leaders that are able to adapt and survive in an adverse economic environment. Top executives must be ready to unlearn and relearn skills, while simultaneously embracing the volatility of new functions and new roles that are being created to keep pace with the digital wave.

In 2019, India witnessed severe job cuts in the automobile sector and this was attributed to the disadvantages of automation by many. However, the fact of the matter is that existing skillsets of thousands of mid- and top-tier professionals in India are not letting them participate in the digital revolution.

The explosive demand that technology has created in the last few decades is constantly countered by the minimal supply of competent technologists against the creation of such posts as chief transformation officers, chief sustainability officers and many previously unheard of yet important roles. Almost all industries have already been exponentially disrupted by technology.

Fintech is transacting in milliseconds, e-commerce is slowly replacing traditional retailers, and medtech is monitoring our pulse by the minute. Industries are growing at a rate not seen before, and customers are demanding more and more each day.

Despite the slowdown, India is expediting its cybersecurity measures, and the government as well as private organisations are aggressively hiring entire ecosystems to address these needs. Companies like IBM India, Amazon India and Infosys are hiring cybersecurity personnel and first responders, with chief security information officers as leads. India needs a million cybersecurity personnel in 2020 for a market estimated by Nasscom at $35 billion by 2025.

These industries are creating the next big wave of ‘new jobs’. Analytics and Big Data, along with renewable energy, are not new industries. Yet, they are reporting some of the largest funding and recruitment strategies of the decade, according to IRENA (2018). EY, PwC and Deloitte, with other banking, financial services and insurance giants, have reported a collective need of over 1.5 lakh analysts and leaders during 2020 (‘Great Learning’). The Global Wind Energy Council reports that the Indian renewable energy sector is looking at 2.5 million recruitments in 2020 under initiatives like ‘Make-in-India’, led by such companies as Tata, Suzlon and ReNew.

Drone Shipping and E-Retail are hiring executives with legislature and policy-making experience as these industries are just as vulnerable as they are powerful. With the rise of mobile internet, Nykaa, Flipkart and Reliance are engaging workforces to target the predicted $200-billion market by 2026.

Organisations are investing heavily in reskilling programmes to increase the value of their existing contributors, while creating new jobs in the process and retaining existing ones. Hence, leadership must consistently upskill to become a source of constant innovation, or be ready to be replaced by those with more relevant and recent skills.

Unless they have trained technologists and innovators in pole positions, it is a blind passage for organisations to accept and implement changes and be successful in the ever-shifting new digital economy.

50,['18/03/2020'],"Uncertainty index can help frame policy, says RBI study","Mumbai: An RBI-published study has called for the setting up of an uncertainty index to help frame policy responses. The study finds that both investment activity and real GDP growth fall in the face of heightened uncertainty in the economy.

The study uses a novel dataset — consisting of newspaper articles and internet search intensity data — to construct three alternative indices for measuring uncertainty in the Indian context.

Plotting the values for uncertainty against various economic activities, the study concludes that uncertainty correlates negatively with economic activity in India. “Therefore, on an average, the higher the uncertainty, the lower is the private consumption, bank credit, private investment and output. This underlines the strong procyclical nature of uncertainty,” said the report authored by Nalin Priyaranjan and Bhanu Pratap .

Like investment, overall economic activity (real GDP) also witnesses a sharp fall in response to an uncertainty shock triggering almost a 0.8% loss in growth in the model published in the report. Another conclusion is that the financial markets appear to factor-in uncertainty in advance, while uncertainty seems to ‘lead’ the changes in investments and consumption. The report has constructed three uncertainty indices based on newspaper articles, sentiment analysis of news articles and internet search intensity. “From a policy perspective, our results suggest that policymakers can use the information on uncertainty for devising policy framework and institutional arrangements that foster sound and predictable policies, the report said.

PATNA: A 12-year-old girl is struggling for her life at the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) after being raped by a 15-year-old boy at a village under Kanti police station area in Muzaffarpur district on Tuesday. Police said the accused, who is also a minor, is absconding after the incident.

The incident took place when the victim had gone to an agricultural field outside her native village for grazing her goats. The accused, stated to be her neighbour, was already there for grazing his goats. Taking advantage of the girl being alone, the boy raped her. As she fell unconscious after the crime, the accused escaped from the spot.

Some local residents, however, spotted the girl bleeding profusely. They immediately admitted her to the primary health centre at Kanti from where she was later referred to the SKMCH for treatment. The doctors attending to the survivor said that her condition deteriorated due to excess bleeding and rupture in private parts.

Muzaffarpur DSP (West) Krishna Murari Prasad said that the swab of the survivor has been collected and sent for medical test. Women’s police station SHO Abha Rani along with another woman police officer recorded the survivor’s statement in the hospital and subsequently lodged an FIR against the accused. The DSP said that the accused, who is also stated to be a minor, escaped soon after the news about the incident spread in the area. Police have detained some close relatives of the accused to exert pressure on him to surrender before the police.

A para-medical staff, who first attended to the girl at the Kanti PMC, said the girl had received grievous injuries and signs of protest were evident on her body. She was referred to SKMCH as her condition was critical.

PATNA/AURANGABAD: With barely three days left for the execution of death warrant against Akshay Kumar Singh alias Akshay Thakur and other Nirbhaya case convicts, his 29-year-old wife Punita Devi has filed a divorce petition in a family court at Aurangabad in Bihar. Akshay and three other convicts are to be hanged on March 20 in connection with the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.

Punita, the mother of a nine-year-old male child, filed a divorce petition before the principal judge of Aurangabad family court, Ram Lal Sharma, on Monday. In her petition, Punita said she doesn’t want to live as a widow for the rest of her life after the hanging of her 36-year-old husband.

Akshay, a native of Karma Lahang village under Tandwa police station in Aurangabad district , is currently lodged in Delhi’s Tihar Jail. Punita’s legal counsel Mukesh Kumar Singh said the court has fixed March 19 as the next date of hearing on the divorce petition. Quoting Section 13 (2) (II) of Hindu Marriage Act 1955, the advocate said, “A woman has the legal right to seek divorce from her husband after the latter’s conviction on rape charges.”

According to the divorce petition, Akshay got married to Punita from Gango village under Pipratand police station in Palamu district of neighbouring Jharkhand on May 29, 2010. The couple was blessed with a son, Priyanshu, on July 4, 2011. Akshay, who worked in a private firm in New Delhi at the time of marriage, used to visit his native village from time to time.

Punita said the idea to seek divorce struck her mind after Akshay was held guilty in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case and subsequently death warrants were issued against him. Even the last ray of hope ended after the rejection of mercy petition by the President of India. “Now I don’t want to live as the widow of a rapist for the rest of my life. So, I have moved the divorce petition,” she said.

Though the petition was submitted on March 12, the court took up the matter on March 16 and listed the case for next hearing on March 19. When asked whether it was another ploy to stay the execution of hanging scheduled for March 20, the advocate said it’s not like that. “My client has moved the court for natural justice,” he said.

The court is likely to issue notice to Akshay on March 19 when the case would be taken up for hearing. Apart from Akshay, Mukesh Singh, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma have been awarded capital punishment in the case.

While aviation, tourism and hospitality were the first casualty on account of travel restrictions during precautions taken in the first stage, retail businesses are also taking a hit as cities go into lockdown.On Monday, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had said the pandemic would clip off up to 1.5 percentage points from global growth and the impact on India was still being studied.Many economists are forecasting a recession. “We expect 2020 global growth to dip to 0.9%, the lowest since the global financial crisis, when global growth bottomed at -0.5% in 2009. This will be worse than the global recession of 2001,” Morgan Stanley had said in a recent report.“We are monitoring two key risk factors: The duration of Covid-19-related economic disruption, and the duration of dislocations in financial markets, especially credit.

The development is a direct result of more people staying at home with the onset of Covid-19 Leading restaurant owners have initiated talks with their landlords for a change in rental arrangements. They are considering a revenue-sharing agreement, based on monthly sales, with the landlords since overall revenue is going to tank further in coming weeks.National Restaurant Association of India ( NRAI ) president Anurag Katriar, who also runs multiple restaurants like Indigo, has sent a letter to the Mumbai excise commissioner, saying it should extend existing liquor licence validity and its renewals by three months. The reason cited is that the outlets are incurring losses and won’t have capital to pay for renewal fees, which is also 15% higher than last year.Restaurant owners are considering salary cuts across the board to stay afloat, while a few smaller outlets have already let go of some of their staff, according to NRAI executives. The association has around 10,000 members, many of whom run large national chains. If things keep becoming worse, the industry — which employs 7 million people — could see job losses of 1 million, according to Katriar.The regional arms of NRAI are in the process of issuing an ‘advisory’ to partner members to shut their restaurants over the next two weeks in order to contain any possible risk of community spread of the coronavirus. “We realise it will be a big financial burden on us (issuing advisory to voluntary shut restaurants). But there is a huge risk to the public and our staff. We are requesting power utilities for discounts, seeking moratorium from loans taken from banks and an interest-waiver,” added Katriar.Some of the restaurant owners are asking their staff to utilise their paid leaves while restaurants remain shut or with very little operations to service online orders. Leading restaurateur Manu Chandra , who runs Toast & Tonic and Monkey Bar, among other brands, said it’s a “recession on steroids”.He added that the effects of coronavirus outbreak are hugely tangible — with a 50-80% drop in revenue and footfalls. “So, we will have to implore our landlords to be considerate in these very, very difficult times. Nobody wants to lay off people. But if there is no way to pay them, then how does one continue to employ them,” he added.While the situation looks grim, industry executives said the next two weeks are crucial in terms of the fate of the sector, which may take longer to recover if the virus spreads faster in India. They are hoping for a government stimulus to come through to survive what is being seen as the biggest crisis they have ever seen.At the same time, orders on both major platforms Swiggy and Zomato have fallen by 20% over the weekend, according to one of the sources briefed on the matter. While both players clocked close to 1.5 million orders each in the previous Sunday, the number fell to around 1.2 million last Sunday as customers limit contact with strangers.“The delay of IPL will also have a significant impact on online food delivery growth as it is equivalent to Diwali sales for e-tailers, which helps set a new benchmark,” said one of the sources briefed on the matter.

Some, however, have worked out ways to keep their operations running with a minimal in-office staff.For brokerages, among the main hurdles is the imposition of the no-cellphones rule during market hours for traders if they work from a remote location. This is done to stop leakage in trading data and client positions, which could be used for insider trading or front-running, both illegal acts under Sebi rules.According to Ashish Pyasi, associate partner of law firm Dhir and Dhir Associates, “It will be challenging to maintain the record of transactions and recordings if employees work from home . Unless a system, which will cover these situations, is put in place immediately, it will be hard for regulators and stock exchanges to keep a check.”Also, financial intermediaries depend on trading terminals for price updates and feeds in order to place bets, and to have similar infrastructure at home is difficult.Pradeep Gupta, co-founder & VC, Anand Rathi Group , said that it had looked at a work-from-home solution and bifurcated work basis on what is possible and what it may face in terms of regulatory or compliance challenges. “Trading cannot happen from home as it requires terminals and has to be done from office, from the designated desk and by the designated person according to compliance.”At Centrum Capital, dealers and traders, who punch orders on BOLT, have not been allowed to work from home, while its sales and research analysts have been advised to work remotely. However, Motilal Oswal Group has put up secondary facilities so that business critical employees could work either from office or from another place so that they could avoid public transport, Sudhir Dhar, its ED & head of HR, said.Sebi regulations for mutual funds and market intermediaries do not expressly prohibit remote connectivity for employees. “The stipulations mandate data localisation while ensuring data security and integrity,” said Arka Mookerjee, partner, J Sagar Associates. “Given the nature of cloud-based connectivity that the world has been moving towards, this is a good opportunity to test preparedness, especially for smaller players. However information management, including unpublished price-sensitive information, have to be carefully managed by the employee concerned to avoid leakage of information.”Interestingly, insider-trading violations were one of the most investigated cases by Sebi in fiscal 2019. The markets regulator probed 70 cases in 2018-19, a fourfold jump in cases it investigated in fiscal 2018.Neil Parikh, chairman, PPFAS Mutual Fund, said “We have asked staff to work from home for at least two weeks as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. However, for critical functions like fund management, NAV calculations, we will have some staff coming to office for the next two-three days until we are comfortable that these can be managed from home without any delay.”",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74684297,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-326502,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-work-from-home-for-brokerages-mfs/articleshow/74682162.cms

The panel will take stock of the situation after 15 days and decide on the poll schedule amid indications that civic polls in Kolkata and Howrah may be held by April-end.

“We are delaying the elections due to the situation over coronavirus. We were fully prepared but the present situation is not conducive for conducting polls. We will review the situation after 15 days and decide on the election schedule thereafter,” said state election commissioner Saurabh Das. At the all-party meeting called by Das on Monday, party representatives endorsed the decision.

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, at a high-level meeting at Nabanna, said: “Covid-19 is a danger to humanity. Our first priority is to avert the virus and save lives. Elections can be held later.” Taking the cue, TMC leader Subrata Bakshi said: “We support the SEC proposal to defer the civic polls. Let the SEC decide on the poll schedule later in consultation with the state government.”

Congress Rajya Sabha member Pradip Bhattacharya said: “We have no problem if SEC defers the civic polls due to the virus threat.” BJP state vice-president Jayprakash Majumdar said: “We are concerned over the new virus and also over the people’s urge for civic polls.” CPM leader Sujan Chakrabarty, while endorsing the decision, said: “There was confusion over holding of the civic polls. The virus now has come as a plea to defer the polls.”

The SEC will take stock of the situation by March-end but is unlikely to issue the election notification because the state government has extended the reasonable restrictions on public gatherings up to April 15. If the notification is issued after April 15, civic polls in Kolkata and Howrah will be pushed to last week of May.

64,['18/03/2020'],Varsity land can’t be used for housing scheme: HC,"Vijayawada: The high court on Tuesday directed the government against utilising land belonging to Acharya N G Ranga Agriculture University in Amaravati for the housing scheme. The government recently took a decision to use the unused land of various institutions for the scheme.

One Ponnekanti Koteswara Rao from Guntur filed a PIL seeking directions to the government to refrain from taking over land allotted to the university. The land, which originally belonged to Sri Venkateswara Veternary University, was transferred to the Agriculture University to set up seven different institutions like state seed farms, DNA and fingerprint analysis laboratory, quality control and testing laboratory, model farm and seed processing and storage godown.

Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, senior counsel K Manikanteswara Rao said the state government had allotted 110 acres of lands to the university. Out of which about 37.5 acres have been allotted to various institutions and the remaining land is being taken over by the government for the ousing scheme.

Considering the arguments, the high court issued interim orders directing the government not allot the university land for house sites and issued notices to the chief secretary, principal secretaries of revenue, agriculture departments and other officials from Guntur district whom the petitioner made respondents in the case.

Later, the high court heard a petition challenging the reservation applied in the ensuing local body elections and posted the hearing to six weeks later. One Anand from Prakasam district had moved the high court contending that the new reservation adopted by the government was faulty as the quota remained unchanged at several places.

Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, advocate Pranati said with the new method adopted by the state government instead of the earlier rotations system to decide reservation in local bodies, many sections of the society did not get reservation in the present elections.

66,['18/03/2020'],Covid-19 scare in Kolkata: Clubs take preventive steps but put responsibility onus on members,"KOLKATA: The Covid-19 pandemic has left the top brass of several city clubs battling a dilemma on how to approach fellow members and ask them to refrain from visiting the club if they have recently travelled abroad. Though clubs have taken a slew of measures announced by the government, including closure of swimming pool and gymnasium and putting in place deep cleaning protocol, senior committee members admitted the virus could only be blocked through responsible behaviour of members and not extensive sterilization efforts.Following the advisories from the Centre and state govenrment, Tollygunge Club has suspended reciprocal affiliation with clubs across India and rest of the world that allows members of other affiliate clubs to walk into Tolly and enjoy the facilities here. But it has been unable to bluntly ask members who have travelled recently to stay out for at least a fortnight. A large section of the club’s members are senior corporate executives and businessmen and many travel overseas frequently.“All our members are educated and established individuals. Naturally, one expects them to be responsible citizens. We have through a mailer made the concern of Covid-19 infection known to the members and expect those who have travelled abroad in recent times to stay away for the time being,” said Tolly Club chief executive and managing director Anil Mukerji.Celebrating its 125th year, The Tolly has bad to cancel a jazz fest organised by Alliance Francaise and a cultural and heritage festival to mark 400 years of Bengal, shut down the swimming pool and gym. The kitchen has been fumigated and a rigorous housekeeping regimen put in place to keep the virus at bay.At Calcutta Rowing Club , secretary Chandan Roychowdhury listed out a slew of measures that had been taken including cancellation of DJ nights and weekly programmes. But he conceded there was no way to ensure a member who had travelled abroad didn’t visit the club unless the member acted responsibly. “We can only request members to keep the club safe; not monitor their travel itinerary. On our part, we are doing everything to secure the premises,” said Roychowdhury.CRC and Lake Club have decided to suspend rowing activities. Sources said that while rowing was a non-contact sport and allowed enough social distancing to keep the virus from spreading, the change rooms used by rowers were a matter of concern.At CCFC, committee member Saugata Nandi, too, admitted the high profile of members made it difficult to employ screening activities that corporates could employ in offices. “A club is a place to socialise. We cannot police them. We have requested those who have travelled abroad to stay away for 15 days and hope they do so,” said Nandi, adding that the club has advanced the final match of the merchants’ cup cricket by three days to Wednesday to finish off sporting engagements at the earliest.Calcutta Club, too, has cancelled a tennis tournament, drama and other programmes scheduled to be held later this month. “The club’s revenues are taking a hit but there is little one can do in these hard times,” said A Basu, former president of the club.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74692822,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-123361,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/clubs-take-preventive-steps-but-put-responsibility-onus-on-members/articleshow/74681921.cms
67,['18/03/2020'],Kannur MCH likely to get virology laboratory soon,"Kannur: In the backdrop of the Covid-19 threat, and the increased instances of viral infections, the demand to set up a Virology laboratory at Kannur Govt Medical College in Pariyaram in the district has gained momentum, and the discussions in this regard are going on, giving rise to the hope that it might become a reality soon, according to the officials.

Though places like Kozhikode, Thrissur, Alappuzha and Thiruvananthapuram have such facilities, there is no such facility in north Malabar and in the present health scenario it would be beneficial to have a virology laboratory here, said medical college principal N Roy.

“We have already mooted such a proposal and held discussions with the directorate of medical education, and if the laboratory comes up here , it would be beneficial for the residents of the north Malabar region, because it would bring down the time to get the results in case of infections like the present one,” he said.

Now, even when the swab is tested in Kozhikode laboratory, it takes a day to get the result.

But if there is a laboratory here, the result would be made available within hours and this would help the treatment and isolation of the patients, in case they test positive.

According to the authorities of the medical college, which was taken over from the cooperative sector by the state government, they have the floor space and manpower to handle such a facility and the total expense to set up a moderate laboratory would be less than Rs 25 lakh.

“We can set up the laboratory in a 1,500-1,800sq ft space with a separate entry, which is available here and it additionally requires a RT-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) facility to test for the Covid-19 virus,” said Rajan Joseph Payyappilli, head of the department of microbiology.

All other facilities are there, including the dedicated manpower, as they have already got a microbiology laboratory with basic facilities.

Once the lab is set up and it gets the sanction from the National Virology Institute in Pune, which has to provide the probe to identify the virus, it will be of great use even if it is a moderate facility, according to the authorities of the medical College.

Moreover, since the institution offers post-graduation in microbiology, such a laboratory would be beneficial for the researches of the students as well, they said, adding that they are hopeful the government would consider the proposal favourably.

70,['18/03/2020'],"Now, Indian can coach ISL team","Panaji: Derrick Pereira and Clifford Miranda , both of whom took charge of FC Goa on an interim basis, can take permanent charge of the team, according to rules being framed for next season of the Indian Super League ( ISL ).

Since inception of the ISL in 2014, Indian coaches have not been allowed to take charge. If there were marquee managers at the start, foreign coaches, even if they had valid coaching licenses, needed approval of the organisers till last season.

Now, all that is set to change with the organisers allowing any coach with a Pro Coaching Licence to take charge from next season.

“The decision to appoint a coach has been left entirely to the respective clubs. The only requirement, whether it’s for a foreign or Indian, is a Pro-License,” said one official who has been tracking the development.

Last season, the organisers had said that an assistant coach can be appointed the head coach, if he has a Pro License, has been with the club for at least two years, on the bench for 16 matches, and has experience of managing a team in the top division. No such rules will now be in force as anyone with a licence can take charge.

“The league has in the past refused quite a few coaches, despite having valid licenses,” said the source.

Except probably at FC Goa, the new guidelines are unlikely to tempt clubs to put an Indian at the helm of affairs. Clubs like Bengaluru FC, Chennaiyin FC, NorthEast United FC and Odisha FC all have Indian coaches with Pro licence on their rolls, but it’s unlikely that any of them would be considered for the top post.

The only possibility remains at FC Goa where Derrick Pereira has his own set of admirers and is understood to have made club president Akshay Tandon think. FC Goa will compete in the AFC Champions League next season and a decision on the coach – with 90 applicants jostling for the job – expected next month.

When FC Goa decided to part ways with Sergio Lobera at a crucial stage, Derrick was the first choice to steady the ship. He held the first team meeting, had discussions with players, but had to take a backseat – at least for official purposes – as the organisers said he couldn’t be appointed as interim coach, since he wasn’t part of the first team coaching staff. Clifford was then handed the responsibility and the duo ensured there were no hurdles, winning the next three games and finishing on top at the end of the league stage. Goa bowed out in the semifinals after a 5-6 aggregate loss against Chennaiyin FC.

71,['18/03/2020'],"Oppn objects to two RS nominations, EC order today","Kolkata: Two Rajya Sabha nominations from Bengal have come under question during scrutiny of papers submitted for the polls slated for March 26. The Election Commission will decide on the two nominations on Tuesday.

One of them is by Dinesh Bajaj, former Trinamool MLA from Jorasanko who has submitted his nomination as an Independent candidate, and the other is former MP and TMC candidate Mausam Noor. Cancellation of either of the two, or both, nominations won’t require voting on March 26 as the remaining five or four with valid nominations will be elected unopposed.

Bajaj has submitted a self-signed affidavit. Left candidate and senior lawyer Bikash Bhattacharya pointed this out to the presiding officer. An affidavit becomes notarized after it is presented to a notary public and the affiant (the individual requesting notarization) swears under oath that the facts contained therein are true. A notarized affidavit, thus, bears the signature of the notary public. Bajaj’s affidavit doesn’t bear any such signature.

Noor, in her notarized affidavit, hasn’t mentioned the criminal cases slapped on her during TMC regime while she was a Congress MP. According to a Supreme Court ruling, a party giving nomination to a candidate having criminal cases has to upload it on social websites and publish it in at least one newspaper justifying its choice. TMC has uploaded it on the party’s official website only.

Noor hasn’t declared one of her properties. Left MLAs pointed out that she has filled the nomination form as Mausam Noor when her name in the passport is Mausam Benazir Noor. “My name in EPIC is Mausam Noor. I have put my signature following my name in the EPIC,” the candidate said.

72,['18/03/2020'],‘300 transformers added to improve power supply’,"Q. Has there been an increase in Hyderabad’s power consumption? What are the plans to meet this demand during summer? – Rajeshwari Vasireddy

A. There has been a rise in the power demand every year during summer. In last May, the maximum power demand was 3,300 MW and is expected to touch 3,500 MW this summer. Presently, Greater Hyderabad is getting about 2,600 MW and has been supplying power without any hurdles. TSSPDCL is fully ready to meet power demand during the upcoming summer. Tree cutting and line maintenance works have already taken up and will be completed in the next 10 days. If there is any overloading on the existing transformers, additional distribution transformers will be added. We have already provided 300 transformers in the city and 200 more will be added in April. TSSDPCL will provide 22 numbers 12.5 MVA transformers in the substation for better power supply.

Q. I am a resident of S R C Naik Nagar, IDA Jeedimetla. My locality is facing an issue of power outages caused due to obstruction by tree branches. Can you replace old lines with cables so that we don’t have to choose between the green cover and uninterrupted power supply? -- Vamsi Tadepalli

A. Yes, I will personally look into the issue to ensure that such power interruptions do not occur in the future and the concerned officer will be instructed to take all preventive measures.

Q. I live in old Alwal and our electricity bill amount, over the past few months has been increasing by Rs 100 – Rs 150. What should I do? -- Jai Prakash Sharma

A. Please contact local Assistant Engineer/Operation or ADE/Operation/ Lalbazar to check the meter. Though I think that the bill being generated is correct, if necessary, they will arrange for the meter to be tested in the laboratory.

Q. There are close to 1000 flats in our colony situated in Hydernagar near Miyapur Metro Terminus.

We have a problem of high voltage that’s leading to high power consumption and frequent fusing of bulbs. -- G Harihara IIyer

A. Assistant Divisional Engineer/Operation/ Miyapur will be instructed to reduce the taps of power transformers in the sub-stations to maintain rated voltage.

Q. Residents of east Marrepally are regularly faced with voltage fluctuations due to overgrown tree branches on the HT lines opposite Addaguta Substation. When we complained, we were told cutting tree branches is GHMC’s job. This tussle has resulted in consumers suffering. -- N Ramanathan

A. There is no dispute between the GHMC and the electricity department. The ADE/Operation/Marredpally will be instructed to trim all tree branches near LT and 11KV lines, in coordination with the GHMC. Steps will be taken to arrest power theft.

Q. The TSSPDCL has not kept pace with paperless payment (digital) in spite of the PM's announcement four years ago. Your department does not accept debit cards for payment. Why do you not use POS instruments? -- Dr Y S Prabhakar Rao

A. Yes, the debit card facility is available for those using the TSSPDCL App for online payment of current bills. At present there is no facility to make such payments at banks or at department counters. The matter will be resolved shortly.

Q. We have been experiencing voltage problems in Rajapet 33KV area in Yadadri district for the last two months, specially post 5 pm. On enquiry we were told that it was because of some problem with rural feeders and instructions from top. – Rajender Reddy

A. Instructions have already been given to local officials to operate taps in 33/11KV sub-station to maintain rated voltage. Even Transco officials have been requested to look into.

Q. Just to check the power supply one has to call the assistant engineer’s office and the lineman comes after repeated reminders. When he does, he doesn’t do the work unless bribed/paid. This is harassment. -- Ram Thakur

A. We haven’t received many such complaints. But if we do, serious action will be taken against those involved after SE/Vigilance inquiry.

Q. The call centre for power issues, 1912, isn’t effective at all. Even during long power outages, they seem unaware of any such issue. My humble suggestion would be to wind-up this centre. – Chandra Shekhar

A. Instructions are being issued for effective handling of phone calls at 1912 (ECR) and to propose more operators.

Q. For the last few months our apartments i.e. Patel's BrightView Hislop Road Kowkoor has been facing frequent outages from Kowkoor Substation, sometimes for hours together. Also, we have observed voltage fluctuation. -- Ayyagari Srinivas

A. The instructions have been issued to not take up any long shutdowns and to avoid voltage fluctuations in future. However, this will be under observation.

Q. While buying a second-hand house or flat, one has to not only submit all documents for verification to the registering authority but also the GHMC for changing name in their registers. If that’s not all, the same set of documents have to be submitted yet again to TSSPDCL. Here also all the documents have to be signed by a notary signature etc etc. My question is, since all the documents are verified at two different government offices, why a third verification? The certificate from GHMC should suffice, shouldn't it? For an octogenarian like me, this is also an expensive affair because I have to engage a middleman to do the running around, who’ll also fleece me. Can this not be simplified? – A H Menon

A. The ownership and others are essential and signature of transferor and transferee are needed to avoid legal complications.

Q. We belong to Symphony Park Homes - a GHMC community. Due to non-completion by the builder despite paying full amount we constructed on our own and approached High Court for the delay in providing electricity connections to our villas. The High Court ordered Patancheru ADE to provide electricity to 150 villas within a time frame of six weeks. This time frame lapsed on February 20, but the builder is still choosy in providing electricity and not heeding to High court order. We request you to look into the matter and help us get our electricity connections without any further delay. --

Sudheer P

A. The concerned DE/Operation/Patancheru is instructed to solve the issue as per the advice of SLA.

Q. The TSSPDCL staff have not been coming on time to issue our electricity bills on time at Lokayuktha colony in Udgyognagar (Badangpet). Can you please look into it? – V Dharma Raj

A. Instructions will be issued to the concerned officials to take meter readings on time.

MADURAI: A team of officials conducted an inspection in hotels and illegal stays in Kodaikanal on Tuesday to check whether any new accommodations were provided in the wake of the Covid-19 scare. The move comes after hoteliers were instructed not to provide accommodation to visitors any further and start vacating those already staying.

Based on orders from the state government all sightseeing places in the hill station were closed from Tuesday until further orders. At present, only those who are awaiting tickets and making arrangements for alternate travel plans are allowed to stay in hill stations.

The team consisting of officials from the revenue, municipality, tourism, police and health departments conducted searches. “While the checks were conducted in various parts of the tourist town, importance was given to Vattakanal area, which is preferred by foreigners. It is also the place where a large number of illegal stays had mushroomed in the recent past,” said an official, who took part in the inspection.

The team came across a hotel, which had violated the orders and provided accommodation to six German tourists. They did not inform the police or health officials. The hotelier was let off with a severe warning. The hotel will be shut down if he is found violating the rules next time, officials said.

Secretary of Kodaikanal hoteliers association, Abdul Kani Raja said they have been fully cooperating with the officials.

He said that those,who are already staying in hotels have been asked to vacate. However, they are given a day or two to arrange for travel.

Raja admitted that illegal stays pose a threat during this time. Based on a court order a year back, around 300 hotels were sealed for violating masterplan rules. With just around 100 hotels available, illegal stays have sprung up to cash in on the demand, Raja said.

Similarly, tourist places in Madurai and other southern districts were closed from Tuesday onwards.

A tourism official from Madurai said, “As far as Madurai is concerned there is no restriction in providing accommodation to visitors, but hotels have been asked to provide all the information regarding their guests and their travel history.”

74,['18/03/2020'],Drug to treat inflammation may worsen Covid-19,"New Delhi: People showing symptoms of the novel coronavirus should refrain from taking anti-inflammatory drug Ibuprofen and use paracetamol instead. This claim by France’s health minister has received support from World Health Organization ( WHO ). The UN health agency’s experts on Tuesday said they were ‘looking into this to give further guidance.’“In the meantime, we recommend using paracetamol, and not Ibuprofen as a self-medication. That’s important,” said an expert. He added that if Ibuprofen had been “prescribed by a professional, then, of course, that’s up to them.”A recent study published in medical journal, The Lancet, hypothesised that an enzyme boosted by anti-inflammatory drugs such as Ibuprofen could facilitate and worsen Covid-19 infection. This was followed by a warning from French health minister Veran who advised Covid-19 suspects to refrain from using the drug, commonly prescribed and consumed over-the-counter for fever, pain and inflammation.“In case of fever, take paracetamol,” the minister wrote and stressed that patients already being treated with anti-inflammatory drugs should take advice from their doctors.Paracetamol must be taken strictly according to the recommended dose, because too much of it can damage the liver.The Covid-19 pandemic has infected around two lakh people globally and killed over 7,800. It is known to cause fever, dry cough and shortness of breath in most patients, but in some cases, involving elderly and those with co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease, among others, it can result in pneumonia and multi-organ failure leading to death.There is no cure for the disease and treatment involves symptomatic relief mostly. Recently, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) suggested that Lopinavir and Ritonavir, anti-HIV drugs, could be used in adults who are confirmed positive for Covid-19 and have complications such as: severe respiratory distress, very low blood pressure and new-onset organ dysfunction. It has fixed parameters to decide how severe the respiratory distress should be for the fixed dose combination to be used on a patient.Similar parameters have been fixed for other possible complications as well, upon which the drug can be used to save the patients.According to ICMR experts, the inclusion of the anti-HIV drugs for treating Covid-19 was based on earlier evidence about their effectiveness against SARS and MERS coronaviruses that led to outbreaks in different parts of the world in 2002-03 and 2012, respectively, as well as the docking studies conducted by National Institute of Virology, Pune.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/drug-to-treat-inflammation-may-worsen-covid-19/articleshow/74701118.cms

Speaking to TOI, superintendent of the Central Prison of Nellore, MR Ravi Kiran said it is the first prison to have come forward to manufacture face masks to address the scarcity of face masks in the market. Prisoners in the tailoring unit designed the face masks as per the recommendations of the government doctors and district administration, he added.

At present, the inmates are manufacturing two types of three-layered reusable masks — with elastic band and thread model . Based on the orders received from government and private organisations, our prison has manufactured over 5,000 masks so far and we have managed to manufacture over 2,000 masks per day, he added. The mask manufactured at Nellore prison is cheaper than other masks as each mask costs Rs 15 for government institutions and Rs 16 for private individuals, Ravi Kiran added.

With the demand for face masks rising due to COVID-19 scare, there has have been instances where medical stores were found selling them at a higher rate than the marked price.

“We have asked for the trained inmates to manufacture face masks for prisoners, jail staff and visitors to the prison. The inmates of the tailoring units used to manufacture at least 700 masks per day with the available resources. If there is a shortage of raw material, we will arrange for more and are ready to supply the face masks to institutions and individuals. Each mask costs around Rs 15,” said superintendent of Visakhapatnam Central Prison, S Rahul.

IG of Prisons, G Jayavardhan said they have directed wardens and others officials at prisons to organise sensitisation drives to spread awareness about COVID-19 and send daily updates to the headquarters. Apart from that, steps have been taken to prevent the possible spread of the virus in the prisons. Arrangements have been made to identify the prisoners if they were to fall ill and shift them to hospitals, he added.

The photo that displayed sewage overflow on the streets of Jagruthi Nagar was reported by Ballari Sai, a resident of the area. “The sewage water was overflowing on the streets for nearly five to six days. The place had turned into a stinky mess, making it difficult for the commuters to cross the lane and use the road,” said Sai, adding that the sewage overflow emanated foul smell, leaving commuters and passers-by inconvenienced. The leakage also posed potential health hazards and was a serious cause for concern for the residents of the area.

Soon after the issue was highlighted on the Times Citizen My Space page, HMWS&SB officials swung into action and resolved the issue immediately. Although the HMWS&SB swiftly resolved the issue, residents claim that the issue of sewage overflow is one that resurfaces every couple of weeks. They urged authorities to find a permanent solution.

“Before the onset of monsoon, the HMWS&SB and the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation should work together to find a permanent solution for the sewage overflow issue in the area,” said a resident.

Residents claimed that other issues such as open manholes and frequent power cuts also plague the area and requested the authorities concerned to address the issues.

The passenger who reported to Kasaragod health authorities on his return from Mangaluru International Airport, tested positive for Covid-19, said minister for health and family welfare B R Sreeramulu on Tuesday.

He said surveillance teams in the two districts are coordinating with each other in contact tracing. “The passenger, as per reports, boarded a taxi from MIA and went straight to Kasaragod. Standard health protocols as per ministry guidelines have been initiated, and all those who met the passenger are being monitored,” the health minister said.

A Facebook post by the Kasaragod information department, quoting district medical officer M V Ramadas, said the passenger who had symptoms of Covid-19 after reporting to the general hospital, was initially placed under house quarantine. Since his swab reports from the National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha, confirmed that he had Covid-19, he was shifted to the isolation ward at the Kasaragod general hospital, Dr Ramadas said.

The information department added that as on March 16, 325 people were under observation for Covid-19 and 321 are under home quarantine in Kasaragod district.

On the same day, two passengers who arrived from Brazil and Dubai, respectively, were shifted to the isolation ward at the general hospital and their swab samples have been sent for testing, Dr Ramadas said, adding the administration is working as per protocols laid down by the government.

The resolution has been submitted to Alappuzha district collector M Anjana seeking her immediate intervention in this issue.

Municipal chairman Illikkal Kunjumon said though all the public gatherings have been banned, there is no control or ban on the long queues in front of Bevco outlets.

“Many strangers keep coming to the outlets of Bevco daily. We don’t know who they are and where they come from. So as per the present situation, it is not safe. The health department directed that each people should keep a distance of one metre. In these outlets, people are not keeping such distance and people were seen in close physical proximity to each other. It is very dangerous considering the present situation. So, we have decided to pass a resolution drawing the attention of the district administration and authorities concerned to this issue,” the municipal chairman said.

According to the municipal councillors, the place for standing in the queue in front of Bevco is a narrow and congested place. “Some are also drinking alcohol near the outlets using same glass. These are creating risk for the spread of Covid-19,” they said

“Majority of the council members supported our resolution and we are expecting a positive step in this regard,” said the municipal chairman.

PUNE: The anti-CAA protesters staging an agitation since January 10 at the ‘Kondhwa Shaheen Baugh’ on Tuesday turned down the police’s appeal to suspend their stir till March 31 in view of the health hazard posed by the Covid-19 contagion.

They have, however, agreed to “significantly reduce” the number of demonstrators at the protest site.

Senior inspector Vinayak Gaikwad and other police officers held a meeting with the protesters on Tuesday afternoon to convince them about the need for such measures. The protest, which sees the attendance of hundreds of women and girls every day, has been organised outside Konark Mall in Kondhwa under the banner of Kul Jamaat-e-Tanzeem (KJT), an umbrella organization of several groups.

Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Suhas Bawache told TOI, “We appealed to the protesters to suspend the agitation. If they are not considering our plea, then we will take a call on taking action against them depending on the situation.”

Alsaba Shaikh, one of the KJT committee members, said, “We have decided to reduce the number of protesters from around 400 to 10-15 people. Our agitation is peaceful and will continue till our demands of revoking Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) is met.”

Gaikwad told TOI, “We approached the protesters following a directive from the city police’s special branch. We have given them copies of the decision taken by the state government and the district administration regarding large gatherings. We will decide on action against the protesters under Section 188 (disobedience of order duly promulgated by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code, if the agitation continues.”

The district administration has already invoked provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and the Disaster Management Act across Pune district.

Another committee member Gazala Shaikh said, “We have created apt awareness on coronavirus in slums and lower middle class localities and struck a balance by reducing the number of protesters in the larger public interest.”

Haji Gafur Pathan, a PMC corporator and one of the organisers of the agitation, said, “Altogether 25 organisations have come together for the protest. The district administration has been requesting us from Day 1 to discontinue with the protests. We have taken adequate precautions to see that the virus situation does not affect our agitation.”

On Tuesday, mayor Sandip Joshi visited the family of Covid-19 positive patients to boost their morale.

So, were the district collector and mayor risking their lives by exposing themselves to corona suspects? Doctors say keeping a safe distance from the suspects is enough, and there is no need to run from them.

“We must deal with this crisis seriously and strictly maintain safe distance from Covid-19 suspects, even those who are in home quarantine. But, this doesn’t mean we should not visit their homes, or stop talking to them, or run away from them,” said physician and former IMA national president Dr YS Deshpande .

“Suspects who have tested negative and are in 14-day home quarantine are not patients. They are in quarantine to ensure safety of others. If they are not showing any symptoms after testing negative for Covid-19, it’s safe to visit them. You can also talk to both patients wearing safety masks,” he said.

Those who test positive are immediately admitted to the isolation wards of GMCH. Doctors treating them shared some important rules to deal with these patients.

“Those who have been found positive in test are infected, and they are admitted in isolation. Only doctors can enter their rooms, that too wearing all protection gear. Others may talk to them, but from outside their room, maintaining a safe distance and wearing masks,” said a resident doctor who is treating three positive patients admitted in GMCH.

“When district collector, DDHS and dean of our college visited these patients, they interacted with them from outside their room. There is no risk in it,” the doctor added.

Microbiologist Dr Pritam Agrawal shared some basics regarding Covid-19 that clarify many things about the distance to be maintained.

“Similar to seasonal flu, people can get infected with Covid-19 if they inhale water droplets containing the virus, such as when someone sneezes on them, or by touching a surface contaminated by the virus and then touching their nose or mouth or rubbing their eyes. We can easily avoid this by maintaining distance and hand hygiene,” she said.

Besides, the protesters also demand the state government to provide risk allowance to nurses, who “put their life in danger for the treatment and welfare of patients.”

Following health alerts, the body has also demanded that other government employees should also be given leaves like staff of government schools.

Deepak Joshi, president of the Uttarakhand General & OBC Employees Association, told TOI, “We have been very clear in our demand that we will not back off till the government complies with Supreme Court orders on reservation in promotion. However, in wake of coronavirus scare, we have made slight changes to our protests. The number of protesters at Parade Ground will remain limited.”

Meanwhile, Virendra Gosain, general secretary of the organisation, told TOI, “Nurses play a crucial role in serving people, therefore, we have sought a risk allowance for them. In view of the coronavirus outbreak, the protest time of hospital staff has also been reduced to just one hour.”

94,['18/03/2020'],Health ministry experts stresses on extensive contact tracing in Pune,"Pune: Extensive contact tracing of infected people is the only way forward to rein in the spread of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in the city, stressed experts from the Union health ministry’s National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).

In the city to review the containment plan, the experts advised the health officials to track and isolate even low-risk contacts of infected people to reduce the risk of exposure in the community.

Simply put, it means if an infected person visited a neighbourhood doctor for an initial check-up for flu symptoms, then not just the doctor, other patients waiting for their turn in the lobby area and all the paramedics present there should also be tracked and home-quarantined for 14 days.

Confirming it, senior public health expert Subhash Salunke, former director-general of state health department, said, “Pune has reported maximum cases of Covid-19 in India. This has prompted the visit of the NCDC experts, who reviewed Pune’s containment plan and suggested a few measures. Their foremost advice is to carry out extensive tracing of contacts of Covid19 infected persons.”

Salunkhe, a part of the technical team of the state government that abreast the NCDC experts about the state’s containment plan, said, “That means everyone who was around that person should be tracked and isolated at their homes for 14 days. This includes infected person's high-risk and low-risk contacts. And if any of them develop any symptoms, then they should be moved to hospital’s isolation facility and tested for the contagion.”

Currently, officials have adopted cluster containment strategy to track everyone residing around 3km periphery of the infected person’s residence to see whether they have influenza-like symptoms.

“Instead of tracking every household within the 3km periphery, it is more important to first make an extensive list of all the contacts of the infected persons falling in high- as well as low-risk category and isolate them at their homes for 14 days to reduce the risk of exposure, if any, to the community,” Salunke said.

State surveillance officer Pradip Awate said, “The Union health ministry experts held a meeting of all the staffers involved in contact tracing in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and rural parts on Tuesday (March17) to underscore the importance of extensive contact tracing in the current situation.”

THE CONTACTS

Close (high-risk) contacts of a Covid-19 infected person include those living in the same household and having had direct physical contact (shaking hands) with him/her, those having unprotected direct contact with infectious secretions of an infected person, a person who was in a closed environment with an infected person for 15 minutes or more and at a distance of less than two metres.

The low-risk contacts are persons who were in a closed environment with a Covid-19 infected person for less than 15 minutes or at a distance of over two metres, a person having had face-to-face contact with an infected person for less than 15 minutes and at a distance of less than two metres or travelling together with an infected person in any kind of conveyance.

96,['18/03/2020'],Covid-19 in Pune: More than 800 restaurants down shutters for three days,"Picture used for representational purpose only

PUNE: A majority of restaurants and bars in Pune city have decided to voluntarily down shutters for three days from Wednesday till Friday in an attempt to arrest the spread of Covid-19. Many restaurants in the city had decided to batten down from Tuesday itself.

While the commissioner of police told TOI that the police has suggested restaurants continue parcel and home delivery services for customers dependant on the establishments for daily meals, Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA) said that restaurants may take a call such services if it was viable.

A quick check on online food ordering and delivery platforms showed that many restaurants in the city were unserviceable on Tuesday. Nevertheless, many others, like fast food chains, remained functional on Tuesday.

After a meeting with the police commissioner on Tuesday and appeals sent out by the police to shut establishments that see high footfall, PRAHA decided to send a ‘closed for business’ call to all associated restaurants for the next three days. Earlier on Tuesday morning, the police requested several restaurants, including Vaishali, Roopali, Good Luck, Wadeshwar, among others, on FC Road to close. This was followed by a meeting between the Pune police commissioner and PRAHA members, where the decision was taken.

Pune commissioner of police K Venkatesham said, “We are following instructions issued by the Union government on maintaining sanitation, personal hygiene and social distancing. Wherever this can be followed, those establishments can open. But, as we are aware, maintaining social distancing may not be possible in case of restaurants if they are functioning. Hence, we requested restaurateurs to close establishments temporarily in view of the current situation. Out of their own volition, restaurant owners then decided to keep their establishments shut for three days.”

Venkatesham added that because the city is home to a number of people dependent on restaurants for meals, parcel and home delivery services will be available. “The feasibility of this should be decided by the restaurants because the priority here is to opt for social distancing and other measures to avoid the stage-3 of Covid-19 outbreak,” he said.

PRAHA vice president Vikram Shetty said, “The police authorities have told us to cooperate in the endeavour to curb the spread of infection and we have decided that keeping the restaurants closed for three days is best in the current situation. Oftentimes, people do not understand the gravity of a situation and throng restaurants considering it to be a holiday. Hence, the association has made a conscious call to ask members to remain closed till Friday.”

Ganesh Shetty, president of the association, said, “It was decided that all restaurants and bars will voluntarily close for business from March 18 to 20 initially. We will assess the situation and decide on Friday if there is need to extend the closure.”

Sources from the Pune Hoteliers’ Association added that hotels too have curtailed their restaurant operations in the wake of the decision.

He said the FDA has received a few complaints.

Shingne was speaking to the manufacturers and dealers of masks and sanitisers at a meeting organised at the government guest house in Nashik.

After reviewing the demand and supply status of these two products, Shingne said the demand has increased by more than 30%. He said that to meet the demand, sanitisers should be manufactured at the local level. All efforts would be made by the government to provide the necessary permissions, the supply of raw materials etc.

He also said the production of masks should be increased. He said that if someone was found selling the masks and sanitizers illegally, the FDA would take action against the dealer concerned.

Shingne added that while some manufacturers had shown willingness to manufacture alcohol-free sanitisers, permission in this regard would be given only after checking their effectiveness.

Gorakh Chaudhary, the president of the Chemists’ Association, Nashik, said that while the demand of masks and sanitisers has increased over the past couple of weeks, the chain of demand and supply has been disturbed. Nonetheless, he said the association members they would restore the supply of sanitisers and masks in the next two-three days.

Many wholesalers are running out of stock in the city. The wholesalers said that the demand from chemists and druggists in the city and other parts of the district was huge, but they were awaiting the supply from manufactures.

Shingne said should stop going to crowded places, use handkerchiefs instead of masks and make use of sanitisers to clean hands.

With over 40 testing positive for Covid-19, Maharashtra seems to be the worst-affected.MSRTC’s deputy general manager (DGM) Shivajirao Jagtap said, “As per government orders, bus services cannot be stopped completely. However, as schools and colleges have been ordered closure, we have been rescheduling our trips by withdrawing buses meant for students.”“In the region, at least 15% operations will be reduced. We are keeping a close watch on the situation. Traffic from Pune to Nagpur is satisfactory but there is thin volume towards Pune. If this continues, we will have to withdraw the number of trips to Pune, which are 40 now,” Jagtap said.The coronavirus scare has also led the MSRTC’s Nagpur division to curtail operations. Divisional controller Nilesh S Belsare said, “With schools closing down, we have chalked out a plan to curtail operations in the district by 35,000km (25%). Currently, the division operates buses on 1.70 lakh km routes. From March 18, it will operate on 1.35 lakh km. Considering the revenue of Rs30 per km, we will lose around Rs9 lakh per day.”“From March 20, we will also curtail some trips on trunk routes like Wardha, Amravati, Yavatmal, Chandrapur, Bhandara and Gondia where frequency is good,” said Belsare.He said, “From Wednesday, MSRTC plans mass distribution of 1,000 masks daily to conductors and supervisors who are more vulnerable to public contact. Due to shortage of masks, we will distribute at least 750, which will be destroyed at the end of the day.”Similar piquant situation is being faced by private bus operators who fear the number of trips between Nagpur and Pune will come down below 50% from Wednesday. If at least 70 buses are operating towards Pune from Nagpur, it is expected to come down to 25-30.“In the advent of temporary closure of IT sector in Pune, most of the people from Vidarbha employed there have returned. In the last 15 days, there was a rush on Pune-Nagpur route as people have been asked to work from home. Most of them have returned. During the same period, buses leaving from Nagpur to Pune had few passengers,” said Mahendra Luley, president of Nagpur Private Travels Association (NPTA).“The rush from Pune had even led to increase in fare from Rs1,000 to Rs1,700, but for Pune now there are no bookings even for Rs800 in sleeper class bus travel,” said Bobby Saini of Saini Travels.Saini added, “It is not only Pune route that has been hit. Similar is the case with Shirdi and Hyderabad. People have been avoiding travel to other cities. If the virus scare continues for a month, it will be difficult to even pay EMIs of buses.”",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/msrtc-pvt-bus-operators-to-curtail-operations/articleshow/74680990.cms

The sights, sounds and sheer architectural brilliance of the place left me spellbound. Our itinerary was packed from day 1. We visited a host of places, but the images that stayed with me were from the mesmerizing cruise, the stroll we took along the sprawling Gold souk, the adventurous desert safari, the marvel that was Abu Dhabi.

The huge mosque in Abu Dhabi, complete with intricate carvings all over its interiors, is picturesque and a treat to every eye. It is huge, beautiful and the chandeliers adorning the inside are breathtakingly beautiful. So are the tall buildings in Dubai with glass façades. Though a complete contrast in design, these too are praiseworthy.

The Palm Island which is totally man-made, stretching across kilometres of land extending right into the sea, has huge hotels like Atlantis lining its side. The entire frame makes one makes one wonder the power of man.

Although the place is a desert, there’s a lot of greenery that has been developed to create a sense of calm and peace.

As part of our trip we also visited Burj Dubai known for its unique shape and finally ended at the Burj Khalifa – the tallest and the most exquisite building on the face of the earth today. It was something I had never seen or experienced before. It’s a classic mix of top-notch design and advanced technology. The lift here took us to 124th floor within a span of just a minute. The view from top is amazing. It gives goose bumps, makes one feel on top of the world. This is the highest point in the world – it feels like one has conquered the world. It was really a mind-blowing experience for us. We were in awe looking at the design and construction of the huge buildings around each with a unique design of its own.

Finally, the trip made me realise that if a person wishes he/she can conquer anything in life. It is just a matter of vision and dedication. It was really a life-changing experience for me and my family.

The man had returned from the US recently and was quarantined thereafter at Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital in Pimpri, after he developed mild symptoms.

Of the 17 cases in Pune, 10 are Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits, while the other seven are from Pune. Incidentally, there has been no fresh case of the contagion within the limits of Pune Municipal Corporation in the past four days.

“He returned from the US on March 14. When he came to know that US has been placed on the list of countries to be monitored by the government for Covid-19 infection, he self-reported to YCM hospital on March 16. He is in good health and only has very mild symptoms,” municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said.

“There was no one at home when he came back from the US. Those he is likely to have interacted with on the way from Mumbai airport to Pune are still being traced. It is becoming difficult for people to recollect others they have interacted with or come in close contact with in the past 7-10 days. They take about 2-3 days to recollect and then we have to trace them,” Hardikar added.

Kunal Udane, owner of German Bakery, said, “Last week, food deliveries increased, though walk-ins reduced. However, on Monday, we noticed a significant drop in delivery orders as well.”

Abhishek Shetty, owner of Kalinga Pure Veg, said, “Home delivery orders have dropped as people are wary.”

Fewer deliveries were visible on Tuesday as restaurants began closing. “Thousands have opted to go back to their home towns. This has hurt our business,” Shetty said.

After colleges shut, students from other cities have gone back home and hostels have emptied out affecting delivery orders, a restaurant employee said.

Spokespersons from online food ordering and delivery platforms, Zomato and Swiggy, said they have undertaken several measures in wake of the spurt in Covid-19 cases.

Both offered contactless delivery, where patrons can pay online, call them and request for the parcel to be dropped at the door.

A Swiggy representative said that masks have been provided to delivery executives and they are trained on respiratory hygiene practices, washing hands and identification of symptoms.

A company spokesperson from Zomato said, “We are using multiple channels of communication to sensitise our employees, users, restaurants as well as delivery partners.”

Shetty said some restaurants are not able to pay the staff from other states whose families want them back. Many restaurants may close down as they do not have the money to pay for the hiked excise licence charges.

“The flow of passengers from Nashik to Pune grew thin after 10am. The MSRTC had to cancel a couple of trips in the morning,” a senior state transport utility official said.

According to the official, the inflow of passengers from Pune to Nashik was very high on Sunday. “On Sundays we see number of people traveling from Nashik to Pune. However, on March 15, we had more than 1,000 people travelling to Nashik by MSRTC buses. There are also reports that people chose to travel even by private cars in groups,” the official said.

The passenger occupancy on Monday was below 50% when compared to the average movement. “Since schools, colleges, institutions have been closed, the movement of students is completely off the road. Now, those who are using the buses are office-goers. Even citizens have stopped travelling,” another MSRTC official said.

The average load factor of MSRTC’s Shivshahi buses is around 60 units and the same on Thursday and Friday was below 50 units. “It fell below 50 percent on Sunday combined for all buses that originated from Nashik division. The only solace on Sunday was the passengers travelling towards Dhule,” he said.

The fate of MSRTC’s city bus was also the same. “We have a near normal movement of people going to Ambad and Satpur from the various places, but apart from that passenger count has dropped drastically. Shops and establishments have also been closed by the government for a fortnight — till March 31. This has cut down the chances of the movement of the people,” the officer said.

The MSRTC official, however, clarified that there would be no cut in services on regular routes despite the weaning number of passengers.

Renowned temples were open, with sanitisers or soap and water at the entrance, and staff and pandits on duty, but there were no devotees on Tuesday. For the first time, most holy places TOI visited had negligible people.The usually crowded Sai Mandir on Wardha Road was so quiet that the sound of the bell echoed. The vendors selling flowers, garlands and prasad had no customers to serve. A liquid soap bottle hung near the washing area, to wash hands before going inside. “The temple is open, but only two devotees came since morning. We have also stopped mahaprasad. There will be no celebrations on Thursday as well,” said Deepak Borgaonkar, a committee member.It was disconcerting to see the pundits worshipping and cleaning the idols with their masks on.The security guard at the entrance of Ganesh Tekdi Mandir was applying nilgiri oil on the wrists of all devotees, a measure to prevent corona according to them. Pouches of soap were also kept near the tap. “In last three days, very few devotees have come. We stopped serving meals or prasad, and only offer modak to Lord Ganesh in the morning,” said Sandeep Sharma, a pandit.On Tuesdays, which is the day of Lord Hanuman, devotees arrive in huge numbers at Ram Nagar Hanuman Mandir. But only two people were there in the evening. The famous Shani Mandir at Sitabuldi had literally no devotee.On the other hand, devotees of Lord Buddha were present in decent numbers at Deekshabhoomi. “Since morning, there was no one inside Deekshabhoomi , but since afternoon people have started to come. We have not kept it closed,” said Bhanteji, a monk.While some devotees were wearing a mask, some had a do-not-care attitude. “We have a wedding in a few weeks in our family. Hence, we came to seek the blessings of Buddha,” said Sonal Uike, a primary schoolteacher.Even Telangkhedi Temple bore a deserted look. The prasad distribution and aarti has been called off until March 31 here. There were no arrangements for sanitizers or soaps too. “Today is Tuesday, and usually devotees line up all the way to the stairs to offer prayers. Today, there is nobody,” said Nilesh Tiwari , head pandit. Other priests believe the number of devotees has decreased from 100-150 to 5-10 in just a day.The staff at all temples was working diligently with masks, cleaning and mopping the courtyards, especially the breathtakingly beautiful Swaminarayan and Balaji Mandir. “We are aware of coronavirus but couldn’t resist visiting the temple.

Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar, who met the representatives of these hospitals, on Tuesday said the health hubs have responded positively and agreed in principle to make 48 beds available for isolation .

Pimpri Chinchwad has so far registered 10 Covid-19 positive cases, highest in the state so far.

“Our effort is to have adequate facilities for isolation and ensuring quarantine of the infected people. Though the current inventory is meeting our requirements, support from private hospitals is being planned as a contingency measure,” he told TOI.

The civic body has made available two more hospitals to quarantine patients, if required. An additional capacity of 80 beds could be available for isolation purposes, Hardikar said, adding that the hospitals might need at least two or more months to establish the required set-up for testing of samples after getting the requisite permissions from the authorities.

Hardikar also said instead of ostracizing anyone, housing societies must focus on home quarantine. “It is the best strategy. There is no other way. Societies telling infected people to go out is like sending the infection out to a broader population”.

Hardikar added that societies must ensure all support, such as providing food, for the home quarantined people so that they did not have to come out. He said people with travel history must self-quarantine for 14 days.

The commissioner said quite a few people from the PCMC limits have approached the corporation to state that they have come from outside. “We are lucky that a lot of our people who travelled and possibly came in contact with the infected people have come forward to self-report,” he said.

Hardikar said of the 10 people testing positive, eight had shown no-symptoms whatsoever. “The ninth person is showing only mild symptoms. The tenth person, who tested positive on Monday, also had very mild symptoms,” he added.

PUNE: Divisional commisisoner Deepak Mhaisekar on Tuesday said stringent measures, including filing of FIRs under Section 188 of IPC, would be taken against incoming travellers violating home quarantine norms.

“Though a tracking method is in place and our staffers are conducting regular checks, it is the duty of the individual to adhere to the home quarantine rules. Over 1,090 people are currently under home quarantine and there will be more under institutional quarantine,” he said.

The state government has made health check a mandatory for travellers from the US, Dubai and Saudi Arabia and suggested institutional quarantine and home quarantine for them in accordance with the Centre’s guidelines.

The Centre had earlier issued instructions for all incoming travellers, including Indians, arriving from China, Italy, Iran, Republic of Korea, France, Spain and Germany after February 15, should be quarantined for a minimum period of 14 days.

The state on Monday said incoming passengers screened at airports and told to remain under home quarantine would be stamped on the back of their hand, “home quarantine”, with immediate effect.

As part of the home quarantine protocol, the Pune district administration has made an mobile application. Once downloaded by the quarantined person, the officials can keep a track of the individual. “If the person switches off the cellphone, our teams will visit his or her residence,” Mhaisekar said.

Presently, Pune distirict has 250 people for surveillance of such quarantined persons. All corporations have appointed operators and they are calling the home quarantine people. The operators are checking their condition and the scanned copies of the latters’ addresses would be with the administration to ensure that they were not out of the administration’s radar.

Under Section 10 of the Epidemic Act, 1897, the administration can take steps to contain the spread of the virus. Forceful institutional quarantine can also be imposed on people not adhering to the home quarantine protocol. Officials said housing society members might also be reached out to for keeping a track on the home quarantined individuals.

“We have discharged our debt to the nation - was the statement made by Justice Gogoi along with the three of us (Justices J Chelameswar, Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph) on January 12, 2018. I am surprised as to how Justice Gogoi, who once exhibited such courage of conviction to uphold the independence of judiciary, has compromised the noble principles of the independence and impartiality of the judiciary,” he said. He was referring to a press conference of four SC judges against then CJI Dipak Misra .

Justice Joseph said he had decided not to take up any post-retirement assignment from the government to keep the independence and impartiality of judiciary intact. “According to me, the acceptance of nomination as member of Rajya Sabha by a former CJI has certainly shaken the confidence of the common man on the independence of judiciary, which is also one of the basic structures of the Constitution,” he said.

“Our great nation continues to be firmly grounded on the basic structures and constitutional values, thanks mainly to the independent judiciary. The moment this confidence of the people is shaken, the moment there is a perception that a section among judges is otherwise biased or looking forward, the tectonic alignment of the nation built on solid foundations is shaken,” he added.

“Only to strengthen this alignment, the collegium system was introduced by the Supreme Court in 1993 to make the judiciary completely independent and not inter-dependent. I came out in the public in an unprecedented move along with Justices Chelameswar, Gogoi and Lokur to tell the nation that there was a threat to this foundation and now I feel the threat is at large,” he said.

PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has restricted entry of citizens and visitors at its zonal and ward-level offices as well as at the main building located in Shivajinagar as a precautionary step to contain the spread of coronavirus.

The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has also followed suit and restricted entry of citizens to its offices.

An official, however, clarified that PMC staffers will continue to work as per scheduled timings in their respective offices. The restrictions pertain only to visitors, the official added.

The civic administration is prompting citizens to e-mail their complaints and suggestions instead of visiting the office till further notice.

On Tuesday, the entry-exit gates of the main administrative building of the PMC and other offices were closed and were put under surveillance. Staff deployed at the gates prevented people from entering the premises and asked them to get in touch via e-mails.

Sources from the administration said that PMC’s main building sees over thousand visitors every day. A similar footfall is registered at other premises in the city, including at ward offices. Most visitors include PMC’s own staffers from other offices, contractors, employees of other government offices and common people. The entry of most people was restricted on Tuesday barring some exceptions, sources said.

A circular, signed by the municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, has also asked civic departments to prefer communication through e-mails instead of delivery of urgent letters by hand. “There is an attempt to restrict movement of people at offices spread across the city. We want to cut short the visits and visitors can postpone their plans by some days in the wake of the Covid-19 scare,” an official from the administration said.

Of the 80 e-mail addresses provided by the administration for correspondence, around 40 are of various departments including road development, solid waste management, electrical and office of municipal/additional municipal commissioners. The remaining are e-mail addresses of ward offices, zonal heads, the tree authority, and deputy commissioners.

One of the villagers expressed apprehension that the river water has been contaminated because of the rotten birds and this might pose danger to the residents down stream. “It has become impossible to even stand near the riverbank because of the stench,” said the villager.

According to sources there is hardly any demand for poultry birds for fear of contracting coronavirus infection. This has resulted in steep decline in prices. The mounting losses may have compelled poultry farmers to dump these birds in the river.

The police are trying to identify the culprit. Meanwhile, the district administration has advised villagers to maintain hygiene in the area.

P Sivaswaroop, regional director of Ignou, said, “Due to the coronavirus epidemic in the country, Ignou has taken several preventive steps. All theory and practical counselling sessions for students have been suspended till March 31.”

“Ignou won’t commit to new dates as of now. They will be rescheduled after the government gives clearance. Revised dates will be intimated to all students,” said Sivaswaroop.

Assignment submission deadline was initially March 31, but now Ignou has extended that as well. “The new deadline is April 30 and its main purpose is to prevent large groups of students gathering at the study centre while submitting assignments. Home assignment question papers are available on Ignou’s website and students are advised to download the assignment question papers and prepare the answers,” said Sivaswaroop.

Ignou is also scheduling some of the counselling classes through Gyanvani FM radio station. Students will be intimated through SMS/e-mail about the radio classes schedule. Gyan Vani is available on 105.6MHz and students can interact with teachers on 0712-2510002.

128,['18/03/2020'],TOI Impact: Even NMRDA schools to shut down till March 31,"Nagpur: Ending the confusion over different shutdown periods for schools and colleges within Nagpur district, the authorities on Monday evening declared that all will remain closed till March 31.

TOI was the only newspaper to report about the discrepancy in which educational institutes under Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA) were to be closed only till March 25, while others were to be shut till the month-end.

The confusion started with the original state government circular which said that areas under corporation, council and panchayat jurisdiction will remain shut till March 31. There was no mention of NMRDA in the circular. Though local authorities immediately sprung into action to rectify this, but their decision to enforce shutdown only till March 25 came in for flak from all quarters. TOI on Monday highlighted the confusion this date discrepancy had created. The same evening, a rectified order was issued changing the date to March 31.

NMRDA covers area under 25km radius starting from Nagpur city limit. It covers about 36% of Nagpur district. It includes nine tehsils of Nagpur rural, Hingna, Kamptee, Parsheoni, Mauda, Saoner, Umred, Kalmeshwar and Kuhi which is an area of roughly 3,500sqkm.

It is, however, confusing to figure out which school or junior college would come under NMRDA because there are many land tracts within the area which are excluded from the urban planning agency’s control. For example, NMRDA does not control Mihan, MIDC, Kamptee cantonment, Kamptee town and Kalmeshwar town.

Schools are pleased that the date has been extended till March 31 as it helps them to avoid confusion. “On Saturday night, we have informed parents through SMS and school app that everything is shut till March 31. Then on Sunday night news came that our schools, being under NMRDA, are to remain closed only till March 25. Had we revised our message at that time, yet another change in the communication to the parents would have been needed,” said a school owner.

PALAKKAD: Three of the four accused who were acquitted by Pocso special court in the Walayar case were arrested on Tuesday by police and produced before the trial court after the high court ordered their arrest on Monday. They were later released on bail.

The accused, M Madhu, V Madhu and Pradeep Kumar , were produced before the court, while the fourth accused Shibu could not be traced. Police said an arrest warrant has been issued against him.

The high court directive came after appeals were filed by the state government and the mother of the victims challenging the verdicts by the special court. The government had said in the appeals that the probe conducted in the cases were faulty and that the angle of murder was not probed.

Meanwhile, there were allegations from the beginning that the investigation was derailed due to political pressure to help the accused. The Pocso court had acquitted all the four accused for want of evidences and the failure of the prosecution to prove the charges.

Since the postmortem report had indicated that both the sisters aged 13 and 8 years were sexually exploited, the case could have been proved by the police if they had taken sincere efforts right from the beginning to collect evidences and firm up witnesses, alleged the victims’s mother.

Adjuvants are agents which are added to a vaccine to boost the recipient’s immune response to produce more antibodies and longer-lasting immunity.The antigen that is currently being used for vaccine development is the spike protein from the novel coronavirus. This protein sits atop the spikes on the virus and mediates coronavirus entry into human cells. The antibodies developed by the immune system act against this spike protein to prevent infection.PVP director Ofer Levy said the team is testing known and new vaccine adjuvants, which were discovered by screening human cells. “For the testing, adjuvants are cheaper to make compared to the spike protein. We can make effective vaccines with lower amounts of costly spike protein, which is important when you plan to produce millions of doses of vaccine,” he said.PVP already has an ongoing project for the elderly through the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). “We were screening small molecules with a focus on influenza and have a biobank of elderly white blood cells. We have been given permission to shift our focus to coronavirus,” Levy said.The blood samples of the elderly patients were provided by Lindsey Baden, director of clinical research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Levy said. The samples were from relatively healthy people aged above 65 and followed at the out-patient department.Levy said the elderly are most at risk from Covid-19. “The immune system of the elderly is distinct. It is harder to get a protective vaccine response in the elderly compared to healthy middle-aged individuals. Therefore, we are working on a vaccine tailored for the elderly,” he said.The research is being funded by the USNIH, specifically the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID).Dr David J Dowling, PhD faculty member in the PVP and co-lead of the coronavirus vaccine effort, said the first mice have already been inoculated with a similar coronavirus spike protein derived from the Sars-2003 coronavirus — with and without a lead adjuvant combination — to get an early read on the antibody response.The timeline for clinical application of these studies depends on the adjuvant identified and its path to clinical trial, but is anticipated to be some months to a year.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74686853,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-136744,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/us-team-developing-corona-vaccine-tailored-for-elderly/articleshow/74682018.cms

Vadodara: Dr Prashant Upadhyay, priest of Shri Baglamukhi Brahmastra Vidya Mandir, seems to have been caught in the quagmire of his misdeeds. After being accused of cheating, he is now accused of rape by a married woman living in Manjalpur.

Upadhyay is currently in jail for two separate cases of cheating a businessman and a couple.

The 28-year-old woman lodged her complaint at Gotri police station on Tuesday in which she has alleged that Upadhyay has raped her several times at his home in Gotri since November 2016.

According to the woman, she started attending Upadhyay’s sermons in 2016 as her husband was Upadhyay’s follower. During the sermons, she started sharing her household issues like conflicts with husband and mother-in-law with Upadhyay. The priest told the woman that she will attain a form of ‘devi’ but will have to make some sacrifices for that state.

On November 22, 2016, Upadhyay asked the woman to meet him at his home in Gotri. When she reached his home, he called her to his bedroom where he raped her and also asked her not to tell anyone about it. The woman told police that she was afraid of getting defamed and so kept mum. She stated that Upadhyay continued calling her to his house on several other occasions until December last year when he forced himself upon her physically without her consent.

Recently when she learnt about his followers approaching the police with criminal complaints, she too got the courage to open up about her ordeal. The woman went to the Gotri police station on Tuesday along with a social worker and filed her complaint.

Police have registered an offence of committing rape on the same woman repeatedly and sexual harassment.

Our flights were booked for March 10, but on March 7 the city was closed down completely. People began rushing to stores, cafes were closed and city seemed like coming to a standstill. We couldn’t even buy groceries without showing a medical certificate at the store, but getting a Covid-19 certificate was even more difficult as all hospitals were crowded with patients.”“Several students like me were stranded at Milan Malpensa Airport for two days. They were not letting us board since patients were being given first preference. On March 11, my brother, who is stuck in US, shared our video on twitter and tagged the government and PM Modi. Finally, we were evacuated on March 14,” Agarwal said.Back home in Varanasi, his father made all arrangements for his check-up at a private hospital on arival. “They were restless as they kept hearing about rising cases and deaths in Italy due to the virus in the news. We have been put up at an isolation centre. The family is relieved since I am healthy and will be with them in 12 days,” he said.Pratyaksh’s father Mukesh Agarwal cried with joy when he heard that government was evacuating him with others. “We lived in anxiety and were relieved when he landed in India.

140,['18/03/2020'],VHP launches campaign against forced religious conversions in Lucknow,"Representative image

LUCKNOW: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has launched a fresh tirade against forced religious conversion of Hindus.

Speaking exclusively to TOI, VHP’s national general secretary Milind Parande said that a campaign has been launched nationally, especially in states like Jharkhand , where tribes are being subjected to conversion to Christianity.

“They (Christian missionaries) are destroying the ancient culture and indigenous religion of the tribals and are resorting to trafficking of their children. The VHP will not allow the heinous conspiracy to succeed,” he said. “We have asked our functionaries to speak to the tribals and remind them of their traditional customs which essentially originate in Hindu traditions,” Parande said.

“Issues like love jihad, where Hindu girls are lured to marry Muslims, are also being brought back. Every year, we bring back at least 2,000 people who have got converted,” he said.

VHP sources said that the right wing body has asked its cadres to work among tribals to nullify the potential threat of religious conversion. Parande said that tribals had produced many brave fighters who had laid down their lives fighting foreign invaders and heretics.

“Some of these valiant efforts like those of Rana Punja’s struggle against Akbar on Maharana Pratap’s side, the struggle of Govind Guru of Bhil tribe against British and the 1857 struggle of Tatya Bhil are renowned all over the world,” he said.

Vishwa Hindu Parishad also seeks to invoke Birsa Munda as a tribal who laid down his life fighting for the cause of Hindu tribal society and the indigenous culture “while facing atrocities of Christians”.

Parande said that the church was conspiring to create an atmosphere of hatred and fear to instigate the people in the name of amended citizenship law.

“The recent violence in the name of protests against CAA happened because of this false propaganda. The missionaries as well as so-called secular gang should desist from such falsehood,” he said.

Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader said that Christian missionary organisations, which had been banned from indulging in illegal trafficking of tribal children, had restarted their operations in the past few months.

“This is very disturbing and a ban should be imposed on them,” he said.

MADURAI: Madurai railway division has hiked the platform ticket fare to Rs 50 with effect from 12am on Wednesday (March 18) until further orders. The five-fold increase from the usual fare of Rs 10 is part of the crowd control mechanism for social distancing to prevent Covid-19 from spreading.

A senior railway official said that it will come into force in all the 139 railway stations under Madurai division. “It could be in effect for at least 10 days,” the official added. It is learnt that 15% of the public stepping into the stations are platform ticket holders and the escalation in fare will drastically reduce their numbers.

“In many cases, there is an unnecessary crowd to send off and receive passengers. With more crowd the chances of Covid-19 spreading is more. So reducing the crowd is good for the passengers as well as those who accompany them,” added the official. The hike would also help keep the platforms clean.

Thought the move will take a hit on revenue generated through the sale of platform tickets, but it is necessary considering the welfare of the passengers.

Officials said that apart from Madurai, platform ticket fares have been hiked to Rs 50 in Chennai Central , Chennai Egmore and Tambaram railway stations till March 31. TNN

The other festivals include Shekhawati tourism festival, Gangaur fair in Jaipur, Gangaur festival in Sahapura, Mewar festival in Udaipur and Baldev cattle fair in Nagore.

Since the state government has urged people to avoid large gatherings, there is no other way than to cancel the festivals, said a senior official in tourism department.

“Containing the spread of coronavirus is the top priority of the government. That’s why we have cancelled these festivals as they gather huge crowds. We have not taken any decision on festivals that fall in April or afterwards. The government will decide on that at the appropriate time,” said Bhanwar Lal, director, tourism department.

The tourism department sponsors these festivals to keep alive the traditional culture of the state. But over the years, they have become a great interest to tourists. The tour operators and travel agents also sell these festivals to global tourists.

Many of these events are also organised on private-public partnership mechanism. Another official in the tourism department said they had decided not to sponsor the Gangaur festival in Shahpura.

“This is a private event and we used to sponsor. But now we have decided not to support the event. They are planning to continue it. But it all depends on the local authorities for giving them permission for the event,” said the official.

Earlier, the government had planned to go ahead with the Rajasthan Foundation Day with scaled down celebrations which are spread across four days, displaying the cultural treasure of the state. But with the virus being declared a pandemic, the government did a quick rethink to cancel the event.

Jail officials said that the infrastructure for such facilities are already in place but in wake of coronavirus pandemic, these facilities will be encouraged.

The inmates have been appealed to use the broadband services of the jail to talk to their family members instead of meeting them in person. The prisons department has a special application which avails this facility.

“The family members of the inmates can download the application on their Android-based phones and on the other hand the inmate will have access to it through our systems in the jail and they can talk through video call,” said jail superintendent Baldevsinh Vaghela. The system known as ‘e-mulakaat’ was in place for some time but was hardly used.

Even if inmates do not want to use the video call facility, in-person meeting has been allowed by jail officials. However, the number of visitors has been capped at two per inmate. “Earlier we used to allow five visitors to meet every inmate and allow seven inmates in the visitors’ room. But now the number of inmates in the visitors’ room will also be no more than five minutes,” Vaghela added. The visitors too will have to wash their hands before entering the visitors’ room.

Video conferencing facility will also be availed for those inmates who have to mark their presence for hearing of their case. Vaghela said that if any inmate has to be part of the hearing like getting examined or give testimony then he or she will be taken to court.

Meanwhile, the jail staff have now started wearing masks inside the jail premises as a precautionary measure.

On Monday, doctors from SSG Hospital met jail inmates to make them aware about the pandemic and how they can prevent it by using various sanitization methods within the jail premises.

CHENNAI: The state government may have shut malls, theatres and pubs to prevent gatherings, but Moore Market Complex suburban railway station was teeming with thousands of commuters returning home after work on Tuesday.

Railways has begun to spray disinfectant at the platforms and trains, but has chosen to leave these thousands unmonitored. There are no desks to sensitise people, and no screening to check if anyone had flu-like symptoms.

More than 2 lakh commuters travel by suburban trains on the Chennai-Gummidipoondi and Chennai-Tiruvallur lines every day. On Tuesday evening, trains were packed. People who work in government offices, private firms and shops in Parrys, Anna Salai and other localities commute to work and return home by these trains.

Though footfalls have reduced at MGR Central and Egmore stations, the volume of people who take the express trains is so huge that it was hardly discernible in the evening peak hour.

Alex P, a regular commuter, said, “There is no checking of suburban commuter anywhere. I travelled to Perambur yesterday and went by train to Ambattur on Tuesday morning. The trains were packed and there seems to be no awareness or caution among people. There is no visible attempt to sensitise people about Covid-19.”

This could be a disaster waiting to happen, said commuters who have no choice but to use the trains as they have to report to work at shops and firms. “Many people who travel on the route are those belonging to middle class and low-income group who work as daily wage workers, maids, sales assistants at shops, workers in industrial estates and others. It is life as usual for them,” said an official.

LUCKNOW: Ten days after registering an FIR in connection with murder of dreaded don Munna Bajrangi alias Prem Prakash in Baghpat jail on July 9, 2018, the Central Bureau of Investigation will start questioning the main accused Sunil Rathi and the jail officials.

CBI has sought permission to question Rathi from authorities of Tihar jail where he was shifted due to security reasons on October 6, 2019, said senior officials of the agency.

The case was transferred to CBI on direction of Allahabad High Court , which said the matter required an in-depth and impartial probe. CBI had then lodged an FIR against Rathi on March 7.

A senior officer privy to the probe said the case papers and chargesheet filed by Baghpat police against Rathi has been collected along with all evidence.

“A detailed questionnaire has been prepared for jailer Uday Pratap Singh, deputy jailers Shivaji Yadav and S P Singh, head warder Arjinder Singh and warder Madhav Kumar who were posted in Baghpat jail at the time of incident,” the officer said.

The questioning of jail staff is important since it is not yet known how the .32 bore pistol used in the killing was sneaked into the prison.

In its chargesheet, Baghpat police had failed to reveal how the murder weapon was sneaked inside and given to Rathi.

A senior CBI officer privy to the probe said Rathi did not have any enmity or connection with Munna Bajrangi and hence it needs to be probed thoroughly as to what prompted him suddenly to take such a drastic step and kill him.

CHENNAI: What if the government has ordered closure of bars as part of precautions against the virus? Tipplers have turned streets with Tasmac outlets as open bars. And the worst hit are residents in the neighbourhood.

As soon as the shutters of liquor outlets were pulled up at noon on Tuesday, many were found drinking in the open in many neighbourhoods. There they stood, barely hiding the bottles; one held out a plastic tumbler into which another poured a stiff drink and water before the two gulped down. On Canal Bank Road near the Kasturba Nagar MRTS station, the public drinkers littered the place with empty bottles, caps and leftovers of food.

Ashok Kumar, a resident of Adyar, said public drinking has always been a menace, now it has been double the trouble. “Usually they drink on the streets in the late evening hours, mostly after the bars shut at 10pm. Now this menace has started early in the day,” said an auto rickshaw driver. “In fact, the government should have closed the liquor outlets along with bars.”

Employees at Tasmac outlet counters said tipplers don’t listen to them if told not to drink in front of the shops. “They ask us where would they go to drink after we closed the bars but not the shop,” said a Tasmac salesman in the northern suburbs. But at some places some men were seen soliciting customers into alleys and selling water and snacks. Luz Corner, a man was seen ushering in prospective customers on the street adjacent to the Thirumayilai MRTS station. No policeman was seen in the vicinity. When contacted, Adyar deputy commissioner Pakalavan said action would be taken against such individuals. “Nobody can use such public space to consume liquor,” he said.

Tasmac officials said they would form special teams to control the spillover on streets. A senior official said police assistance would be sought to check such public nuisance near the outlets. “The teams will visit the outlets and their vicinities,” the official told TOI. Chennai region, which comprises the city and the neighbouring districts of Chengalpet, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur, has 718 bars attached to Tasmac outlets, of which more than 300 are in the core city.

KANYAKUMARI: The Kanyakumari district administration has initiated the process of manufacturing hand sanitizers and cloth masks with help from self-help groups (SHGs) to bridge the gap in demand and supply to combat Covdi-19. “A decision on the same was taken at a meeting on Monday evening,” district collector Prashant M Wadnere told TOI.

There is a wide gap in the demand and supply of hand sanitizers. At the same time, sanitizers made by government medical college hospitals and the health services department are hardly enough for the health department personnel. Face masks too are running out of supply. So, the district administration has decided to seek the help of SHGs.

The collector said they are keen on maintaining medical standards of the sanitizers to serve the purpose. “We are collecting the list of SHGs who are interested in manufacturing hand sanitizers at their place. We are also in the process of arranging for the chemicals that are required for the process. Priority will be in making the sanitizers available for the health department and the public,” he said.

Procurement of bottles for the required size and logistics is also being worked out. Wadnere said that the SHGs will be directly marketing the product in their locality on a no margin or very less margin basis so that it is easily available to the common man. Sanitizers manufactured by SHGs are likely to be available for the public from this weekend.

The health department in Kanyakumari has also provided training to pharmacists from the inter-state bordering areas to make sanitizers and asked them to sell them at an affordable price.

MADURAI: Sanitary workers with the Madurai Corporation , who are one of the most vulnerable to infections, are yet to take any preventive measures with the Covid-19 scare looming large, though the civic body has provided them with protective gear. Most of them can be seen working without wearing the protective gear such as marks and gloves in various parts of the city. The employees handle all sorts of waste collected from households and from collection points without any gloves or masks on. As they visit door to door every morning to collect waste, they can be potential carriers of infections.

A sanitation employee on condition of anonymity said that although they have been issued with protective gear, they do not wear it since it makes the job difficult. “I was issued with masks and gloves, but I left it nearby. It is difficult to wear them and work,” the employee said.

Another employee said that although he is aware of Covid-19, he does not take wearing protective gear seriously since there has not been any detected cases from this part of the state. “Public too are yet to wear masks. There are no used masks seen in the garbage. We will wear them when there is a need,” he said.

Corporation commissioner S Visakan said that all the employees are issued with protective gear. The have also been instructed on the importance of maintaining personnel hygiene in zonal level and ward level meetings conducted by officials. “All employees will be monitored. Those who are found not wearing masks and gloves will be taken to task,” he said. Sanitation employees have been swung into action to disinfect all public places.

MADURAI: With no specific preventive measures for Covid-19 in place yet at the public board exam centres for Classes X to XII, students, teachers and parents urged the school education department to facilitate proper social distancing as per World Health Organisation (WHO) advisory.

“Apart from washing hands, a key measure for prevention of COVID-19 is social distancing. This is why the state government itself has shut down all places where public gather in masses. But, hundreds of children will be gathering at board exam centres. It takes only a minute of carelessness for infection to spread,” said Keerthana S, parent of a Class X student, who will be writing board exams from March 27. In Madurai district alone, 120 centres each for Class XI and XII board exams are functioning, catering to a total of 73,250 student candidates. As per WHO advisory, social distancing requires persons to maintain a distance of at least 3 feet or 1 metre. “Usually, we have two to three students seated on a bench. The distance between the students sitting on the same bench is already around 4 feet. However, the distance between one bench to the one in front or the one behind it, is usually much closer,” said a school staff at one of the board exam centres.

“The government should definitely start bringing in preventive measures for Covid-19 in board exam centres too, especially with Class X exams set to begin. Either the number of centres could be increased or the school education department can ask the centres to use more rooms and accommodate lesser number of students in each with ample space between one student and another,” said the principal of a private school.

Meanwhile, education department officials maintained that they are yet to receive further specific instructions regarding COVID-19 preventive measures to be implemented in the board exam centres.

176,['18/03/2020'],Floor test: SC seeks MP govt reply today,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave 24 hours to the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh led by Kamal Nath to respond to a petition filed by former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan seeking immediate floor test on the ground that the government had been reduced to a minority after the resignation of 22 MLAs.

It did not take much persuasion from senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi for a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta to order, “Issue notice. In view of the urgency of the situation, the notice is made returnable at 10.30 am on March 18, 2020.” It allowed the notice to be served through email and posted further hearing for Wednesday.

The MP assembly Speaker had accepted the resignation of six of the 22 MLAs and the MP Congress legislature party (MPCLP) swiftly moved the SC in the afternoon alleging that BJP had used money and muscle power to abduct the MLAs and kept them in captivity outside the state. It said if the floor test was to be held, it should be done after by-elections to the 22 seats which fell vacant upon the resignation of MLAs.

Before the MPCLP moved the SC, senior advocate Maninder Singh , appearing for the 16 MLAs, requested the bench to make them a party to the petition filed by Chouhan and other BJP MLAs. Singh said the MLAs had resigned of their own volition, being peeved by the Kamal Nath government’s failure to serve the people. The 16 MLAs requested the SC to direct the Speaker to accept their resignations immediately. The bench ordered their petition to be served on the Kamal Nath government.

The 16 MLAs said, “None of the 22 MLAs either came out of Bengaluru nor did they appear before the Speaker. However, the Speaker for reasons best known to him accepted the resignations of only six MLAs on March 14.” While requesting the SC to direct the Speaker to accept their resignations forthwith, they said, “Floor test cannot be withheld under the pretext of the 16 MLAs not being available.”

The MPCLP petition, settled by senior advocate Devadatt Kamat , alleged that BJP had kept the 16 MLAs in complete isolation in Bengaluru to bring down the democratically elected government in MP by misusing the official machinery of the Union and the Karnataka government.

Accusing the governor of pre-judging the situation and directing floor test by concluding that the Kamal Nath government had lost majority in the House without taking into account forcibly taking away of 16 MLAs, MPCLP raised a constitutional question — whether a trust vote ought to be held in the absence of any representation of the electorate who had voted in support of the incumbent government.

“In the instant case, as 22 MLAs, who represent 22 constituencies constituting almost 10% of the total strength of the House, have purportedly resigned, the electorate of such constituencies are completely unrepresented. In these circumstances, a trust vote, if held, will be a complete sham and would be antithetical to the principle of representative democracy which is a basic feature of the Constitution. A floor test in such a situation ought to be held only after by-elections to the seats falling vacant as a result of resignations,” it said.

180,['18/03/2020'],MSU engineering students combat COVID-19 innovatively in slum areas,"They are using their indigenously developed robotic vehicle for the purpose

Vadodara: An innovation that they had carried out as part of their academics is coming handy for a group of students of M S University’s Faculty of Technology and Engineering (FTE), in spreading awareness on coronavirus disease (COVID)-19.

With concern for their family members back home, these students took time off from their exam preparations and chipped in to spread awareness regarding COVID-19 in congested slum areas of the city. For this, they are using their indigenously developed robotic vehicle which received recognition at the 9th edition of Vibrant Gujarat Summit.

“We had prepared this automatic vehicle as part of our project last year. The idea was to make available an automatic mobile vehicle that can be used to spread awareness on social issues or for advertising purposes. But as concerns over coronavirus are spreading, we thought that there cannot be any better use than spreading awareness among the masses with this vehicle,” said Afzal Sufiya, a final year bachelor of engineering student in electronics stream.

Sufiya along with Mahil Dudhat, Yogesh Jadav and Dharmesh Gurjar had developed the vehicle that is fabricated from iron and can be operated through a remote control. Interestingly, all the four are hostel inmates residing in the Polytechnic campus of MSU’s Halls of Residence (hostels).

The final year exams for these students are scheduled to begin from April 11. These students have started their awareness drive from Tuesday at slums located near Kamatibaug and Parshuram Bhatta near Jetalpur bridge.

“We have incorporated the message on what are the symptoms of this disease, what precautions can people take and the emergency contact numbers,” he said, adding that the idea is to reach out in all those congested areas where the poor, illiterate and semi-literate people mostly reside.

“Many of them who have mobile phones are relying on misinformation being spread on social media groups. In other cases, such people do not have any access to mobile phones and are completely clueless on advisory issued by government,” they said.

Vadodara: After an LRD jawan was arrested for raping a college student while on patrolling duty on a PCR van, cops have decided to adopt a more people-friendly approach. City police commissioner Anupam Singh Gahlaut has also decided to overhaul the staff posting in the police department.

“I decided to keep only cops with good communication skills, background and behaviour as police station officer (PSO) and in PCR vans. We work hard round the clock to serve the public and amid that actions of few cops severely spoil our image,” Gahlaut told TOI.

Good behaviour will encourage people to place their trust in the police and help them address citizens’ complaints, he said.

Surajsinh Chauhan, an LRD cop posted in PCR van at Laxmipura police station, allegedly extorted money from a boy and raped his female friend on Gotri-Ankodia Road.

This rape incident also highlighted the rampant allegations of PCR staff extorting money from couples in isolated spots. “Till now, police inspector had the power to post PSO and PCR van staff. Now only DCP-ranking officer will give posting,” Gahlaut added.

The PCR vans are also being driven by cops after a private driver was arrested earlier on allegations of seeking bribe. These cops would be given driving job only for two months and then shifted to other posts, the top cop added.

The city police has 45 PCR vans with a staff of 250 cops that does duty in two shifts every day. These vans patrol different areas and also attend to complaints by citizens.

City health officials will also distribute the products at the Madurai bench of the Madras high court, district collectorate and city police commissionerate.

“The hand sanitiser solutions contain 75% isopropyl alcohol , 1.45% glycerol and 0.125% hydrogen peroxide as per World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for formulation. We have kept the sanitisers available for use by public and staff at all entrances in GRH, outpatient block and wards,” said Dr J Sangumani, GRH dean.

The solutions are supposed to be used within 30 days of preparation and the bottles are not for sale. As of now, the students are preparing around 50 hand sanitiser bottles per day, each 200 ml which also has illustration on the steps for proper hand-washing.

“As and when required, we can step up production. We are mainly trying to be self-sufficient for the hospital’s needs first. The production has been going for the last 4-5 days and we now have enough bottles for use to last for a while at GRH,” hospital sources said. The hospital is also making efforts to continuously clean and disinfect the campus. Patients’ attenders are also being given awareness about hand hygiene and using hand sanitisers.

184,['18/03/2020'],65% of flat buyers defaulting on payments: MCHI-Credai,"MUMBAI: The coronavirus outbreak has had a debilitating effect on the real estate industry with almost 65% flat purchasers defaulting on instalments since last week, said MCHI-Credai , the apex body representing over 1,400 builders in the Mumbai metropolitan region (MMR).

Worse, with the shutting of malls, there are already indications that retail tenants will stop paying rents to mall owners. This, in turn, will have a cascading effect as mall owners will be unable to service their loans to be paid to banks.

“Since June 2019, on an average 25-30% flat buyers of any project were defaulting on installment payment on the due date. However, after the outbreak of COVID 19 pandemic, the situation has become critical with almost 65% customers defaulting in paying their installments linked to construction,” said MCHI-Credai. There are 10,200 residential projects in the MMR registered under the housing regulator, MahaRERA, with a construction area of around 50 million sq ft.

“It is a grim situation and will lead to the complete collapse of the industry,” MCHI-Credai president Nayan Shah told TOI. “The feedback we have been receiving from our members is alarming ever since the coronavirus threat. If buyers don’t pay us, how do we pay back our lenders?” MCHI-Credai said it expected all construction activity to halt in the next two to three weeks as flat purchasers have virtually stopped paying instalments. “Flat purchasers are required to pay instalments based on construction linked milestones under RERA. However, due to the prevailing uncertainty, they are delaying the payments. If the Covid-19 situation continues to prevail, 80 lakh people will be affected in the industry,” it added.

The body’s vice-president Boman Irani said the coronavirus threat has further thrown the industry into turmoil. “We expect the government to intervene and defer payment of taxes and premiums for a year or else there will be a financial crisis in the industry,” he added.

MCHI-Credai has asked the state government to suspend property tax and payment of various premiums to the BMC for one year without interest. “All premiums payable to BMC and state government be reduced by 75% for five years and 0% stamp duty in respect of all new sale of flats for the next six months so that the public is encouraged to buy new houses,” it stated.

The government’s order to shut malls and multiplexes too has led to serious complications. In what is seen as a beginning of the crisis in the retail sector, Shoppers Stop, which is the anchor tenant in Dynamix Mall at Juhu, has written to the mall owner, YJ Realty and Aviation, part of the DB Group, that it will not pay its license fee for the next three months. Shoppers Stop occupies 60,000 sq ft in the mall and pays a monthly rent of Rs 70 lakh.

“As you are aware, the economy is already muted and outbreak of Covid 19 has impacted our business significantly…As our long-standing partner, we are confident you will support us at this critical moment and understand that it would be difficult for us to pay the license fee at the current rates,” said a letter written by Shoppers Stop to the mall owner. “In the event of the mall being shut down, no license fee and other charges shall be payable for the period during which the mall is shut down…the situation will be re-assessed jointly in three months’ time. Once the situation normalises, we will revert to the current payment terms,” it said.

A spokesperson of D B Group said, “If the rent is not paid, then we can’t service our loans not can pay property tax or salaries of our employees. The human tragedy is unbelievable.”

MADURAI: Days after hand sanitizers were declared as essential commodities by the government, pharmacies in the city are still grappling with their short supply and they remain expensive even on maximum retail price (MRP).

“We are expecting the regulating authorities to soon control and bring down the prices of hand sanitizers. Till then, we can only go by the MRPs already fixed. It is because of high demand that even manufacturers are going for a higher MRP but the public should not be burdened at this time of a crisis,” said a pharmacist from Simmakkal. The Chemists and Druggists Association , Madurai district also held a Covid-19 awareness meeting on Monday and advised all pharmacists in the district to strictly sell drugs, masks, soaps, hand wash solutions and hand sanitisers according to MRP only.

“The main issue with regulating a product like hand sanitizer is that there are too many types and brands of different qualities, so it is hard to agree upon a single price unlike masks. The prices mainly depend on alcohol content, quality of other raw materials used and manufacturing process. Of course, different quantities have different prices,” said a medical representative. Pharmacists and customers also noted that hand sanitizer bottles of larger quantities cost less compared to smaller ones.

However, even if the public are ready to shell out exorbitant prices, many pharmacies have few hand sanitizer bottles in stock. This prompts some of them to unofficially sell it Rs 10-30 above even the MRP. “I went to a couple of shops near my house, which luckily had hand sanitizers available. The pharmacist said 50 ml costs Rs 120. But when I checked for the actual MRP, it appeared to have been blacked out with a marker,” said Swetha K, a resident of Anna Nagar.

The Tamil Nadu drugs control department is monitoring the supply and sale of hand sanitizers and are also conducting quality checks. The department can take action if the hand sanitizers are sub-standard or if they are sold for prices above the MRP.

MEERUT: With a fresh batch of 131 people coming from abroad to Meerut, the health department is on its toes to identify the new travellers apart from the 37 who have already been tracked and are being monitored for any symptoms related to coronavirus.

According to health department officials, the most sensitive travellers are the ones coming from eight countries -- China, France, Spain, Italy, South Korea, Japan, Iran and Germany. The officials will stay in touch with the people concerned to keep a track of whether they show symptoms of any sort.

“As many as 37 travellers were already under surveillance. However, with 131 new people coming from abroad, the number of people under surveillance will increase. We are in the process of identifying the travellers and will give a number once the process is complete. All these travellers will be tracked for any symptoms for 14 days to ensure that they do not have the disease. They will also be asked to remain at their homes to prevent any spread of infection,” said Dr Vishwas Chaudhary, Meerut district surveillance officer.

This comes at a time when all the suspected samples sent from Meerut have tested negative for the disease. “The locals should maintain good hygiene, clean their hands as frequently as possible and not touch their face repeatedly. People should not panic and rather take steps to contain the disease,” said Dr Chaudhary.

He further advised that one should mix one litre water with 15 grams of bleaching powder and use it as a disinfectant to clean table tops, floors, door knobs and other places.

188,['18/03/2020'],Man tries to end life over Rs 40k loan,"Vadodara: A building material supplier living at Bil village near the city attempted suicide allegedly due to harassment of loan sharks from Padra. The man identified as Snehal Patel registered an offence of extortion and under Gujarat Moneylenders Act at Manjalpur police station on Monday.

Snehal Patel had borrowed Rs 40,000 from the accused Naseem Vohra and her son Mustakim Vohra in September last year at 11% interest. Patel gave a blank cheque to the accused and paid Rs 4,000 to them every four days as interest.

When Patel was again short of money, he borrowed additional Rs 30,000 from them. Patel paid Rs 3,000 every two days for the money he borrowed later besides Rs 4,000 which he was already paying them.

On March 8, when the accused duo went to Patel’s home asking for interest amount, he asked them to return his blank cheques as he had already paid Rs 2.75 lakh as interest amount. The mother-son duo told Patel that he had only been paying interest so far, while the principal amount is yet to be paid. When Patel refused to pay them any further, the accused reached his home on March 13 and threatened of kidnapping his wife and kill him.

Patel told police that he was afraid of their threats so he consumed rat poison on March 14 near Polo ground and informed his friend too about it. Patel’s friend reached Polo ground in time and took him to SSG Hospital. As Patel’s health recovered on Monday, he approached cops.

189,['18/03/2020'],Yogi Adityanath: Foundation of a new Uttar Pradesh has been laid in 3 years,"(The writer is chief minister of UP:

)

Challenges and opportunities aptly chronicle the three years that our government in Uttar Pradesh completes today. It was truly a historic day when the state was blessed with the nationalist ideology of the Bharatiya Janata Party to serve and nurture it.These past years were a mixed bag, wherein expectations fuelled by aspirations put forth numerous challenges before the UP government. While it was a colossal task to streamline a highly unorganized governance structure, there was also the challenge to bring the downtrodden, marginalised and the poor to the mainstream of society. From illegal mining to illegal slaughterhouses, the challenge was to save both the state and nature. Then there was the urgent need to enrich education, right from basic to higher level.Also, the prevailing anarchy and gundaraj that our government inherited had to be firmly dealt with the motto of ‘Paritranaya Sadhunam, Vinashaya Cha Dushkritam’. There was also the requirement to bring about a revolutionary change in the entire work culture. The challenge was huge, but firm determination made things happen in UP.Our first step was to give ‘khadi’ due respect. The next was to bring the law and order situation under control. This was also made possible by shutting down illegal slaughterhouses.Unnecessary government holidays were scrapped and victims of triple talaq were given due respect and necessary government help.The mantra of ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas’ was made a ground reality with changes in the madrassa education system for Muslim students, bringing them to the mainstream of society.On the noble path of unity, the journey of development is rather smooth and now visible across the state too.While the investors’ summit brought global investment, the underdeveloped and developing regions were given infrastructure development projects like Poorvanchal Expressway (340.82 km), Bundelkhand Expressway (296.07 km) and Ganga Expressway (596 km).Not only are new roads being constructed, also on our priority list is air connectivity. Before 2017, only two UP cities were connected by air. Our government is working on 12 new airports.While construction work of Metros has been expanded in Lucknow, work is in progress in other cities like Kanpur, Jhansi, Varanasi, Agra, Prayagraj and Gorakhpur. The Jewar International Airport will lead to growth and prosperity in NCR, besides global recognition to UP. Improved connectivity and better law and order have resulted in an increase of 18.6% in investors’ interest.The ‘Uttar Pradesh Investors’ Summit 2018’ bagged investment proposals worth `4.28 lakh crore, out of which 371 projects have been implemented. All these will generate more than 33 lakh employment opportunities. In order to speed up industrialization, the government will organize ‘UP Global Investors’ Summit 2020’.In the past three years, the biggest challenge and priority was to bring smiles on the faces of UP’s farmers, who were on the verge of committing suicide. Cane farmers were waiting since ages for someone to solve their problems, or at least understand them. In a short span of three years, the BJP government solved many big problems.A system has been developed to resolve problems related to payments lingering since 1917. The collaboration of empathy towards cane farmers and the execution of planned work, done brick by brick, helped in waiving pending payment dues of more than `92,000 crore. UP topped in sugarcane and sugar production in the country and a record payment of sugarcane worth `92,000 crore was made to farmers. Expansion and crushing capacity of Munderwa, Pipraich and Ramala sugar mills has been increased and the capacity of 11 sugar mills was expanded.For the first time in 25 years, licences of 105 new Khandasari units were approved, which led to 27,850 TCD additional crushing capacity. Similarly, UP has become the largest ethanol supplier in the country. Also, six dozen UP mills are producing 2,000 megawatt of energy, making this industry self-sufficient too.Working in tandem with the prime minister’s resolution to double farmers’ income by 2022, UP has implemented several schemes. The UP government got soil health cards issued to more than 4 crore farmers.Thousands of farmers have been provided 40 to 90% subsidy through a custom hiring centre for purchasing agricultural machinery. Through ‘The Million Farmers’ Schools’, farmers have been imparted training in improved farming at the nyaya panchayat level. This apart, 14 new Krishi Vigyan Kendras have been established. Six new science centres are proposed. Minimum support price, which was a far-fetched dream in previous governments, has been implemented and farmers have been given the benefit at the grass roots level for pulses and oilseeds along with wheat and paddy.So far, under the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Yojana, Rs 12,000 crore has been sent directly to farmers’ accounts and their loans of Rs 36,000 crore have been waived.. The plan to benefit 50 lakh farmers by irrigation of 18 lakh hectare additional land in this financial year will work with projects like Arjun Sahayak, Bhavani and Bandai Dam projects in Bundelkhand region and Saryu Canal, Madhya Ganga Canal, Uttar Pradesh Water Sector Restructuring etc in the plains.In Bundelkhand, more than 8,000 ponds have been built on private land under the ‘Khet Talab’ scheme. This year, 6,000 local ponds will be constructed. Aapi river in Gorakhpur, the Odi in Lalitpur, Gomti river in Ayodhya and the Ganda in Pilibhit have been revived. The Ganga-yatra was a journey from faith to economy, the invocation of farmers and rivers was the same. Under the Namami Gange project, Sisamau sewer point in Kanpur, which used to be a point of flow for 14 crore lt of sewage into the Ganga daily, has been closed, greatly reducing pollution levels in the river in Kanpur. The far-reaching results of the work done by the state government for water conservation on the Ganga and its tributaries will be seen in future. In order to shake off the ‘sick state’ tag, it was essential to provide a prana vayu of good governance to this ‘not-so-good-administration’.In 76 years after Independence, only 12 medical colleges existed in UP. We established 7 new medical colleges and started MBBS classes in them in just 3 years. We laid the foundation stone of 8 medical colleges. Approval was also received from the Centre for establishment of 13 medical colleges. In this way, UP will get the services of 28 medical colleges. Also, AIIMS is coming up in Gorakhpur and Rae Bareli.As a result of improved health services and activities under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the number of encephalitis patients has decreased by 56% and deaths have decreased by 90% in eastern UP.We have started organizing ‘Mukhyamantri Arogya Mela’ at primary health centres for active and enhanced medical services as a more constructive experiment to make the state healthy.Since February 2, lakhs have received free medical facilities in these fairs. Today, our health department is fully prepared to deal with any emergency like coronavirus infection. From launching awareness campaigns to the setting up of isolation wards, from blocking border areas to the installation of thermal analyzers, no effort has been spared.A society can move on the development path only with education. So, we freed education from the clutches of cheating mafia. Through ‘Operation Kayakalp’, basic facilities like boundary wall, toilets, drinking water, electrification are being provided in more than 92,000 primary schools. Also, 45,383 teachers have been recruited and recruitment of 69,000 teachers is in the last phase. Similarly, 55 new government inter colleges have been approved for secondary education.The process to set up Atal Residential Schools has been expedited in circle headquarters for children of labourers and deprived kids.The Vantangia, Kol, Musahar and Tharu tribes, which remained marginalized for centuries, were brought into the mainstream of the society. We declared all their villages as revenue villages and covered them with all government public welfare schemes. They got the right to vote for the first time since Independence.Our government has also focused on women empowerment . Under Mukhyamantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana, more than 1 lakh poor girls were benefited. Effective action was taken against miscreants by establishing ‘Anti-Romeo Squad’. Apart from Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao campaign, ‘Mukhyamantri Kanya Sumangala Yojana’ was also implemented. The result of effective implementation of programmes of health department and women welfare department is that the sex ratio has improved significantly in various districts of the state. There has been a considerable increase in the number of beneficiaries in the Nirashrit Mahila Pension Yojana. Women battalions are being established in Lucknow, Badaun and Gorakhpur. ‘Pink Bus Service’ has been started. In these buses, security personnel along with women conductors are being deployed and CCTV cameras are being installed.On the law and order front, we inherited a helpless police. The places that should have been ‘safe zones’ were ‘safari zones’ of criminals. Our government tried hard to bring law and order back on track. Today, either criminals are fleeing the state or are imprisoned. For better policing, 41 new police stations and 13 new check posts were established in the state. While 1.37 lakh police personnel were recruited, the police commissioner system was also implemented in Lucknow and Gautambudhnagar.Crime figures have dropped to a considerable extent. While dacoity cases decreased by 59.7% in 2019 as compared to 2016, there was a decrease of 47.09% in murder cases in the same period.Due to effective measures taken by the administration and police, no incidents of violence were reported at the time of the order for abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir and at the time of the verdict on Sri Ram Janmabhoomi dispute in Ayodhya.In opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act, some anti-social elements unsuccessfully tried to disturb law and order, but this too was later effectively controlled. After identifying the miscreants, the damage done to property was recovered from them. This effort of governance also gained widespread support throughout the country. The Punjab and Haryana High Court appreciated the improved law and order in the state and said that stringent law should be enforced against criminals on the lines of UP.It is only because of efficient planning that the per capita income is continuously increasing in the state. While per capita income in 2014-15 was `42,267, it has increased to `70,419. It is the achievement of our transparent system that the jobs provided by the state government to 3 lakh people in the last three years are dispute free.It is a matter of personal satisfaction for me that in these three years the state has reached the top in the country in many areas. UP became the first state in the country to implement skill development policy, state health policy and declare human-wildlife conflict a disaster. It also secured the first place by winning the top award for making the most purchases under e-market (Gem). It bagged 9 awards in Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, 7 in MNREGA, 2 in Rurban Mission, 1 in Livelihood Mission, 1 in Gram Swaraj Abhiyan and 1 in NIRDP.Within three years, the rate of maternal mortality declined by 30%. While the state received the highest award for nutrition month, 14 bodies of the state were honoured in the cleanliness survey and received the Krishi Karman Award for highest oilseed production. It was commended to implement an innovative experiment like the Million Farmers’ School (Kisan Pathshala) scheme in the country and abroad, while ‘one district-one product scheme’ was lauded by the central government and was considered good enough to be implemented in every district.The state also got Nari Shakti Puraskar for setting up One Stop Centre under Women Empowerment, National e-Governance Award for Digital Land System, Saubhagya Yojana Award for more power connectivity and 3 national awards for Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities. The state also ranks first in milk, sugar, sugarcane and food production. The state is also a leader in establishment and operation of most medical institutions in the country.UP, with a huge population of 23 crore people, is moving towards becoming a one trillion dollar economy as envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Our ideological vision, which embodies the concept of Rashtrodaya from Antyodaya is relentless in order to satisfy the desire of Awadh, the hope of Poorvanchal, the expectation of Bundelkhand and the aspirations of Paschimanchal. The action being taken by our system under zero tolerance on everyone involved in corruption and malpractices, has been successful in conveying the message of ‘changed system’.For inclusive development, we have presented a budget of Rs 5,12,860.72 crore, which is the biggest budget in the history of the state. In this historic budget dedicated to youth, schemes like Chief Minister’s Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme and Youth Entrepreneurship Development Campaign (YUVA) will prove to be milestones in the field of self-employment and self-reliance.It is the first step of the resolve to take the holy land of Lord Shri Ram and Shri Krishna to the highest glory with the inspiration of the prime minister. I am confident that the remaining 2 years will be in the direction of progress, public welfare and democracy.Yes, on the basis of the fulfilment of the promises made in 2017 elections, the foundation of a new UP has been laid.",allahabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74683039,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-419125,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/foundation-of-a-new-up-has-been-laid-in-3-years/articleshow/74683524.cms

It is the achievement of our transparent system that the jobs provided by the state government to 3 lakh people in the last three years are dispute free.It is a matter of personal satisfaction for me that in these three years the state has reached the top in the country in many areas. UP became the first state in the country to implement skill development policy, state health policy and declare human-wildlife conflict a disaster. It also secured the first place by winning the top award for making the most purchases under e-market (Gem).

It was commended to implement an innovative experiment like the Million Farmers’ School (Kisan Pathshala) scheme in the country and abroad, while ‘one district-one product scheme’ was lauded by the central government and was considered good enough to be implemented in every district.The state also got Nari Shakti Puraskar for setting up One Stop Centre under Women Empowerment, National e-Governance Award for Digital Land System, Saubhagya Yojana Award for more power connectivity and 3 national awards for Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities. The state also ranks first in milk, sugar, sugarcane and food production. The state is also a leader in establishment and operation of most medical institutions in the country.UP, with a huge population of 23 crore people, is moving towards becoming a one trillion dollar economy as envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Our ideological vision, which embodies the concept of Rashtrodaya from Antyodaya is relentless in order to satisfy the desire of Awadh, the hope of Poorvanchal, the expectation of Bundelkhand and the aspirations of Paschimanchal. The action being taken by our system under zero tolerance on everyone involved in corruption and malpractices, has been successful in conveying the message of ‘changed system’.For inclusive development, we have presented a budget of Rs 5,12,860.72 crore, which is the biggest budget in the history of the state. In this historic budget dedicated to youth, schemes like Chief Minister’s Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme and Youth Entrepreneurship Development Campaign (YUVA) will prove to be milestones in the field of self-employment and self-reliance.It is the first step of the resolve to take the holy land of Lord Shri Ram and Shri Krishna to the highest glory with the inspiration of the prime minister.

Challenges and opportunities aptly chronicle the three years that our government in Uttar Pradesh completes today. It was truly a historic day when the state was blessed with the nationalist ideology of the Bharatiya Janata Party to serve and nurture it.These past years were a mixed bag, wherein expectations fuelled by aspirations put forth numerous challenges before the UP government. While it was a colossal task to streamline a highly unorganized governance structure, there was also the challenge to bring the downtrodden, marginalised and the poor to the mainstream of society. From illegal mining to illegal slaughterhouses, the challenge was to save both the state and nature. Then there was the urgent need to enrich education, right from basic to higher level.Also, the prevailing anarchy and gundaraj that our government inherited had to be firmly dealt with the motto of ‘Paritranaya Sadhunam, Vinashaya Cha Dushkritam’. There was also the requirement to bring about a revolutionary change in the entire work culture. The challenge was huge, but firm determination made things happen in UP.Our first step was to give ‘khadi’ due respect. The next was to bring the law and order situation under control. This was also made possible by shutting down illegal slaughterhouses.Unnecessary government holidays were scrapped and victims of triple talaq were given due respect and necessary government help.The mantra of ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas’ was made a ground reality with changes in the madrassa education system for Muslim students, bringing them to the mainstream of society.On the noble path of unity, the journey of development is rather smooth and now visible across the state too.While the investors’ summit brought global investment, the underdeveloped and developing regions were given infrastructure development projects like Poorvanchal Expressway (340.82 km), Bundelkhand Expressway (296.07 km) and Ganga Expressway (596 km).Not only are new roads being constructed, also on our priority list is air connectivity. Before 2017, only two UP cities were connected by air. Our government is working on 12 new airports.While construction work of Metros has been expanded in Lucknow, work is in progress in other cities like Kanpur, Jhansi, Varanasi, Agra, Prayagraj and Gorakhpur. The Jewar International Airport will lead to growth and prosperity in NCR, besides global recognition to UP. Improved connectivity and better law and order have resulted in an increase of 18.6% in investors’ interest.The ‘Uttar Pradesh Investors’ Summit 2018’ bagged investment proposals worth `4.28 lakh crore, out of which 371 projects have been implemented. All these will generate more than 33 lakh employment opportunities. In order to speed up industrialization, the government will organize ‘UP Global Investors’ Summit 2020’.In the past three years, the biggest challenge and priority was to bring smiles on the faces of UP’s farmers, who were on the verge of committing suicide. Cane farmers were waiting since ages for someone to solve their problems, or at least understand them. In a short span of three years, the BJP government solved many big problems.A system has been developed to resolve problems related to payments lingering since 1917. The collaboration of empathy towards cane farmers and the execution of planned work, done brick by brick, helped in waiving pending payment dues of more than `92,000 crore. UP topped in sugarcane and sugar production in the country and a record payment of sugarcane worth `92,000 crore was made to farmers. Expansion and crushing capacity of Munderwa, Pipraich and Ramala sugar mills has been increased and the capacity of 11 sugar mills was expanded.For the first time in 25 years, licences of 105 new Khandasari units were approved, which led to 27,850 TCD additional crushing capacity. Similarly, UP has become the largest ethanol supplier in the country. Also, six dozen UP mills are producing 2,000 megawatt of energy, making this industry self-sufficient too.Working in tandem with the prime minister’s resolution to double farmers’ income by 2022, UP has implemented several schemes. The UP government got soil health cards issued to more than 4 crore farmers.Thousands of farmers have been provided 40 to 90% subsidy through a custom hiring centre for purchasing agricultural machinery. Through ‘The Million Farmers’ Schools’, farmers have been imparted training in improved farming at the nyaya panchayat level. This apart, 14 new Krishi Vigyan Kendras have been established. Six new science centres are proposed. Minimum support price, which was a far-fetched dream in previous governments, has been implemented and farmers have been given the benefit at the grass roots level for pulses and oilseeds along with wheat and paddy.So far, under the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Yojana, Rs 12,000 crore has been sent directly to farmers’ accounts and their loans of Rs 36,000 crore have been waived.. The plan to benefit 50 lakh farmers by irrigation of 18 lakh hectare additional land in this financial year will work with projects like Arjun Sahayak, Bhavani and Bandai Dam projects in Bundelkhand region and Saryu Canal, Madhya Ganga Canal, Uttar Pradesh Water Sector Restructuring etc in the plains.In Bundelkhand, more than 8,000 ponds have been built on private land under the ‘Khet Talab’ scheme. This year, 6,000 local ponds will be constructed. Aapi river in Gorakhpur, the Odi in Lalitpur, Gomti river in Ayodhya and the Ganda in Pilibhit have been revived. The Ganga-yatra was a journey from faith to economy, the invocation of farmers and rivers was the same. Under the Namami Gange project, Sisamau sewer point in Kanpur, which used to be a point of flow for 14 crore lt of sewage into the Ganga daily, has been closed, greatly reducing pollution levels in the river in Kanpur. The far-reaching results of the work done by the state government for water conservation on the Ganga and its tributaries will be seen in future. In order to shake off the ‘sick state’ tag, it was essential to provide a prana vayu of good governance to this ‘not-so-good-administration’.In 76 years after Independence, only 12 medical colleges existed in UP. We established 7 new medical colleges and started MBBS classes in them in just 3 years. We laid the foundation stone of 8 medical colleges. Approval was also received from the Centre for establishment of 13 medical colleges. In this way, UP will get the services of 28 medical colleges. Also, AIIMS is coming up in Gorakhpur and Rae Bareli.As a result of improved health services and activities under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the number of encephalitis patients has decreased by 56% and deaths have decreased by 90% in eastern UP.We have started organizing ‘Mukhyamantri Arogya Mela’ at primary health centres for active and enhanced medical services as a more constructive experiment to make the state healthy.Since February 2, lakhs have received free medical facilities in these fairs. Today, our health department is fully prepared to deal with any emergency like coronavirus infection. From launching awareness campaigns to the setting up of isolation wards, from blocking border areas to the installation of thermal analyzers, no effort has been spared.A society can move on the development path only with education. So, we freed education from the clutches of cheating mafia. Through ‘Operation Kayakalp’, basic facilities like boundary wall, toilets, drinking water, electrification are being provided in more than 92,000 primary schools. Also, 45,383 teachers have been recruited and recruitment of 69,000 teachers is in the last phase. Similarly, 55 new government inter colleges have been approved for secondary education.The process to set up Atal Residential Schools has been expedited in circle headquarters for children of labourers and deprived kids.The Vantangia, Kol, Musahar and Tharu tribes, which remained marginalized for centuries, were brought into the mainstream of the society. We declared all their villages as revenue villages and covered them with all government public welfare schemes. They got the right to vote for the first time since Independence.Our government has also focused on women empowerment . Under Mukhyamantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana, more than 1 lakh poor girls were benefited. Effective action was taken against miscreants by establishing ‘Anti-Romeo Squad’. Apart from Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao campaign, ‘Mukhyamantri Kanya Sumangala Yojana’ was also implemented. The result of effective implementation of programmes of health department and women welfare department is that the sex ratio has improved significantly in various districts of the state. There has been a considerable increase in the number of beneficiaries in the Nirashrit Mahila Pension Yojana. Women battalions are being established in Lucknow, Badaun and Gorakhpur. ‘Pink Bus Service’ has been started. In these buses, security personnel along with women conductors are being deployed and CCTV cameras are being installed.On the law and order front, we inherited a helpless police. The places that should have been ‘safe zones’ were ‘safari zones’ of criminals. Our government tried hard to bring law and order back on track. Today, either criminals are fleeing the state or are imprisoned. For better policing, 41 new police stations and 13 new check posts were established in the state. While 1.37 lakh police personnel were recruited, the police commissioner system was also implemented in Lucknow and Gautambudhnagar.Crime figures have dropped to a considerable extent. While dacoity cases decreased by 59.7% in 2019 as compared to 2016, there was a decrease of 47.09% in murder cases in the same period.Due to effective measures taken by the administration and police, no incidents of violence were reported at the time of the order for abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir and at the time of the verdict on Sri Ram Janmabhoomi dispute in Ayodhya.In opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act, some anti-social elements unsuccessfully tried to disturb law and order, but this too was later effectively controlled. After identifying the miscreants, the damage done to property was recovered from them. This effort of governance also gained widespread support throughout the country. The Punjab and Haryana High Court appreciated the improved law and order in the state and said that stringent law should be enforced against criminals on the lines of UP.It is only because of efficient planning that the per capita income is continuously increasing in the state.

Vadodara: A talati of Sadhli village in Shinor taluka was arrested on Monday for accepting a bribe of Rs 4,000 for giving marriage certificate.

According to anti-corruption bureau (ACB) officials, a resident of Sadhli village had applied for marriage certificate from the gram panchayat.

The accused talati Parth Zala, who lives at Avakhal, kept dilly dallying in giving thecertificate to the applicant.

When the man asked for the reason in delay, Zala told him that he would have to give Rs 4,000 for the certificate. The applicant then approached ACB with a complaint against Zala.

According to ACB plan, it was decided that the man would meet Zala at the gram panchayat office and make the payment.

On Monday, when the complainant met Zala and gave him the money, ACB officials reached there and caught him red-handed taking bribe.

ACB sources said that Zala is a native of Badarkha village of Dholka taluka in Ahmedabad.

MEERUT: A 21-year-old youth allegedly barged into a house and bludgeoned to death a 19-year-old girl in the presence of her horrified family members in the early hours of Tuesday. When he tried to flee, the family members caught him, roughed him up and handed him over to police.

Sources said the accused, Ankit, and the girl, 19, had fled together four days ago from Parasoli village under Budhana police station. They were found and brought back. The girl gave a statement against the youth. This probably enraged him and he went berserk, killing the girl, they added.

Police had on Tuesday sent the girl for a medical examination and handed her over to her family, without taking her before a magistrate to record her statement.

The accused who was also injured is also undergoing treatment in hospital.

Girja Singh Tripathi, deputy superintendent of police, said, “It seems the accused was angry at the girl. He will be questioned to ascertain the motive for the murder.”

Four days ago, on March 13, two brothers allegedly strangled their 35-year-old sister and secretly cremated her body. Police registered an FIR filed by her friend. Investigations revealed that the woman’s brothers did not approve of her relationship with her “friend” and that is why they killed her.

196,['18/03/2020'],‘Cial needs more doctors to screen departing passengers’,"Passengers at the international terminal of Cochin airport on Tuesday

KOCHI: Even though chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Monday that the government will start health screening for departing passengers too at airports, sources at Cochin International Airport Ltd ( Cial ) said that it is not practical in the present situation due to the lack of enough medical staff, including doctors. Airport sources said that at least a 25-member medical team will be needed additionally to set up more health counters at the airport to screen departing passengers . Meanwhile, airport authorities said that they have made arrangements to open additional health counters in departure areas and are in talks with the state health department to deploy doctors.

“At present, Cial has around 90 medical staffs, including 38 doctors, who are doing the health check of arriving passengers at both domestic and international terminals. Even though the passenger flow in both domestic and international sectors has decreased, it is still a hectic task to complete the health screening of all passengers without making them wait for long in queues. Hence, extending the screening to departure area will be more challenging considering the difficulty of getting doctors and paramedical staff as they are busy with Covid-19 operations,” said a source.

Airport director ACK Nair said that Cial has informed the health secretary about the need of more doctors to implement the plan. “We have bought additional tables and chairs to set up more counters. We hope the government will provide doctors for screening duty. Also, passenger flow in international sector has reduced to two-third and less than 50% in domestic. This will decrease further in the coming days as travel regulations become tighter. So we hope some of the doctors deployed here could be reassigned for duty in departure area. Departing passengers’ health screening is inevitable now and it will be implemented in the coming days,” Nair said.

Meanwhile, 2,341 passengers, who arrived in 24 international flights, were screened at Cial between Monday midnight and Tuesday noon. Out of them, 31 passengers with fever symptoms were sent to isolation ward in Government Medical College, Ernakulam. A total of 37 others, who did not have any symptoms, were sent to their homes in ambulances and directed to be in home quarantine as they came from those countries listed under Covid-19 high-risk category.

197,['18/03/2020'],Coronavirus: Private labs can inject life into fight,"NEW DELHI: Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday released guidelines for testing for Covid-19 by private laboratories and requested them to process the tests free of cost. Dr Balram Bhargava, director general of ICMR, said the country needed the support of such labs in weathering the crisis posed by the novel coronavirus The guidelines state that the test should only be carried out when prescribed by a qualified physician. “ICMR will share the standard operating procedures for laboratory testing and provide positive controls for establishing the test as soon as the private laboratory has procured the primers, probes and reagents,” the guidelines said.Covid-19 test requires two key agents: primer and probe. Primer is used to hybridise with the sample DNA of the suspect and define the region of DNA to be amplified in the polymerase chain reaction, a testing method. The probe is used to search for the virus DNA sequence. The government labs prepare their own primer while ICMR provides the probes in batches of around 250 per day, depending on the needs, revealed officials.ICMR said private labs willing to test for free will have to purchase the primers and probes. Some companies are also selling commercial kits with both primer and probe and their results are being validated by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. ICMR said adoption of commercial test kits should be based on NIV validations.The guidelines said “appropriate biosafety and biosecurity precautions should be ensured while collecting samples” or “alternatively, a disease-specific separate collection site may be created”. Private laboratories are also mandated to ensure immediate/ real-time reporting of test results to ICMR and officials of Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme for timely initiation of contact tracing and research activities.Some private labs held a meeting on Tuesday after which, according to sources, Dr Arvind Lal, owner of Dr Lal Path Labs, wrote to Bhargava expressing willingness to help the government if they were provided the test kits for free along with patients' extracted samples. “We shall also be happy to help via our own CSR (corporate social responsibility) funds, where applicable, provided the government gets us the CSR permission from the competent authorities,” Lal wrote.The letter said another option would be to fix a reasonable retail price for patients, arrived at with inputs from private labs, as was done during the H1N1 crisis in 2009. Paying patients would then choose the private labs for the test while patients who want a free test can continue going to government labs. Lal’s letter to ICMR added that there also were many companies that would be happy to use their CSR funds and donate to ICMR if the latter expanded testing to private labs and allowed large-scale screening of people.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74683187,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-290396,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/testing-times-pvt-labs-can-inject-life-into-fight/articleshow/74681280.cms

MEERUT: Rampant rumours of novel coronavirus spreading due to eating non-vegetarian food has hit the poultry industry hard as the sales of chicken have nosedived. While some traders have been trying to balance it by reducing prices, a poultry firm in Bulandshahr district buried alive over 6,000 chicks, as “maintaining them had become unfeasible”.

According to sources, the poultry firm is based out of Punjab and runs a unit in Bulandshahr district in Uttar Pradesh. A huge pit was dug in a field in Mubarakpur village in Bulandshahar’s Unchagaon area where the chicks were dumped and later buried. Photos and videos of the incident were widely shared.

In a similar action, a poultry farmer in Belagavi district of Karnataka, claiming to have suffered huge loss, buried 6,000 poultry birds over steep fall in prices against the existing cost of rearing them which is higher. Video of the burial was widely shared on social media, which drew widespread criticism.

In retail market, traders and meat shop owners are struggling to stay afloat as sales have gone down to “unprecedented levels”. “Our business has been badly hit by rumours on WhatsApp. Misleading texts along with pictures and videos of decomposing chicken were falsely shared as one of the sources of transmission of coronavirus,” Mohammad Musa, who owns a meat shop in Sotiganj area in Meerut, said.

In western Uttar Pradesh, chicken is being sold between Ra 60-80 per kg, which is a considerable drop from Rs 140-160 per kg a month ago.

Sources in the poultry industry claim the considerable drop in prices have badly hit the business as poultry farm owners are having a hard time recovering prices of rearing the birds.

According to an official estimate, 10 crore farmers are directly involved in poultry farming, animal husbandry and fisheries in the country, contributing more than Rs. 1.2 lakh crore to the GDP. Ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry & dairying has already debunked rumours to allay fears of consumers claiming that eating meat, fish and egg is completely safe.

Social media is rife with complaints from passengers who had to change their travel plans in the last few weeks as cases of coronavirus went up in India. And with numerous travel advisories being issued and a large number of flights being cancelled or rescheduled, the confusion over cancellation policies and refunds have only worsened.Low-cost carrier IndiGo said in the last few weeks, it witnessed over 500% increase in queries through calls and emails. Said a travel agent: “There is no order to the chaos. Passengers with flights in April, May and June have been calling up along with those with flights that depart in a few days.” On Tuesday though, a few airlines and travel portals issued guidelines to ease the troubles and clarified on the cancellation fee issue.IndiGo said passengers could visit its website and check FAQs regarding change fee waiver and claim refund for cancelled flight – click on Plan B. It added that in addition to the conventional method of calling the call centre, passengers can also send a support request through an online form and the airline would respond depending on the immediacy of travel and cancellation policies. There are self-serve options available on the airline app and website with a detailed self-help page that works as a ready reckoner, said IndiGo. “If the flight is over two weeks away, consider delaying the request, preferably three days to help deliver to those who are in need first by keeping our call centre lines open...,” said IndiGo. But if the flight is within 14 days and they need to speak with the airline, they could email the airline or call them, it added.On cancellation charges IndiGo said it “was the first airline to introduce zero change fees recently...” “Total refunds are being given only for special cases.

While there have been efforts to sanitise buses and trains, cabs, which play a key role in urban commute, have been completely off the radar.“Firms like Ola and Uber should come forward on their own and insist their drivers to clean the vehicle after the end of every trip and provide masks for whoever uses their vehicles as nobody knows who has coronavirus,” said P Kuganantham , former city health officer.An Ola representative said it has run out of masks and sanitisers, and will replenish them on Wednesday. Uber cited the same reason and said it was prioritizing distribution in cities with ‘greatest’ needs.R Kalanidhi, a cab driver from Chennai, said even if a passenger sneezes or coughs repeatedly, a driver cannot end the trip as the number of bookings has come down drastically in the last 48 hours.On an average, cabs get 18 to 23 bookings a day and travel 230km-250 km to earn Rs 2,500. But on Tuesday, drivers hardly got four or five bookings and earned less than Rs 800 as not many travelled to malls, educational institutions, shops, offices or airport, said another driver.“To meet our daily expenses and pay my children’s school fees, I keep going, ignoring the risk,” Kalanidhi added.The situation was no different when it came to share autos, said R Anbalagan from Chennai Share Auto Drivers’ Association.

This raises concern amongst the students and teachers regarding their safety. Rajasthan government has banned academic activities as well, but no notification has been issued for examination.

“The government has banned gathering of more than 50 people and here thousands of students are sitting for exams every day. Students travel from villages in buses to reach examination centres. Almost all the government and private colleges and universities are conducting final examination. If Delhi University and Uttar Pradesh can ban all academic activities, why can’t our state do it.

A block that once housed the pulmonology department will be ready with 30 beds to treat Covid-19 patients in six weeks, doctors said.Since Monday, passengers coming into Chennai from Covid-19-affected countries are being taken to a quarantine centre – a health department training centre in Poonamallee, infectious disease expert Dr S Raghunandhan , director of institute of internal medicine, Madras Medical College said. On Tuesday morning, there were 41 people in the quarantine facility. “The government is coming up with another facility in Tambaram . It has identified hostel buildings of engineering colleges and other buildings that can be used for this,” he said.As per the revised protocol, people are divided into three categories. The healthy ones are counselled about the disease, need for home quarantine, hygiene and are sent home in a day. About 18 of them who came yesterday were sent home on Tuesday, said joint director of public health Dr P Sampath. They will remain in home quarantine for 28 days and will be monitored by the integrated disease surveillance programme network.Passengers above 60 years of age, especially those who are hypertensive, diabetic or asthmatic and coming from a Covid-19 affected country, are to have considered moderate risk. They are advised to stay in the quarantine facility for 14 days even if they show no symptom. “Two out of 21 people who came into the facility have been asked to stay back,” Dr Sampath said. “Twenty more people joined us this morning.”Passengers landing with fever, cough or shortness of breath are considered high-risk category and sent to hospitals for isolation. The state is increasing the number of such isolation beds in government hospitals and private hospitals. The block at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital is getting converted into a 30-bed isolation unit with international standards for admission of patients with infectious diseases. “In six weeks, we will have a 30-bed unit with all facilities for intensive care.

Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital has been the only one collecting such samples. Now, 10 more government hospitals are likely to collect the samples.Sources said the government plans to activate the crucial sample collection services at these hospitals from Wednesday.Hospitals authorised to collect samples for testing of Covid-19 include Lok Nayak, Sanjay Gandhi Memorial, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, Babu Jagjivan Ram, Hindu Rao, Guru Tegh Bahadur, Maharishi Valmiki and Dr Hedgewar .“The staff have been trained for sample collection,” said a Delhi government official.“People with travel history to countries affected by Covid-19 or history of direct contact with an infected person can call the 24X7 helpline of the state or the Centre and the officials will contact them. Once they are satisfied about the need for testing, the person will be transported in CATS ambulance reserved for the purpose to the sample collection centre,” said another official.Testing for Covid-19 involves collecting sample of the throat and nose swab of the person.“We have been witnessing long queues at our centre for sample collection for Covid-19.

Institutes have taken the initiative after the state health department launched Break the Chain campaign that envisages promotion of hygiene habits and mandatory hand-washing at public places, offices and educational institutions.Meanwhile, the chemistry teachers of Maharaja’s College have gone one step ahead and are making sanitizers in bulk quantity to supply to Government Medical College, Ernakulam , district tourism promotion council and NGOs.“After the launch of Break the Chain campaign, we got directives from officials to use hand sanitizers inside classrooms, exam halls and public access points in the college. We make sanitizers in our labs based on guidelines published by World Health Organization (WHO). But after seeing the Facebook post of our work, medical college students approached with request for sanitizers. We have made around 80 litres of sanitizers,” said Julie Chandra, a chemistry teacher and NSS programme officer of the college.As ethanol’s availability and price is a challenge, most institutions are using isopropanol, which is an alternative suggested by the WHO. “A 100ml bottle of sanitizer we make contains 80% isopropanol, 17% hydrogen peroxide and 3% glycerol. In order to give fragrance, we also add lemongrass essence. Now we have received orders from DTPC and NGO union. We will be making sanitizers for them in the coming days. We only charge the material cost,” said Chandra.St Albert’s College, Sacred Heart (SH) College, Thevara, and Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) are also making sanitizers. “We have made around five litres of sanitizers for the college’s use,” said Jinu George, a chemistry teacher at SH college.St Albert’s College makes pocket-sized bottles of sanitizers, named Break the Chain, with each having a capacity of 20ml. “We are looking for spray-type bottles to fill the sanitizers,” said M A Solomon, HOD, chemistry department, St Albert’s.Cusat vice-chancellor K N Madhusoodanan said the sanitizers they make would be made available to nearby schools where board exams are going on. K Girish Kumar , head of applied chemistry department, Cusat, said the production cost of a 100ml bottle will come to around Rs 75.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74681309,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-76247,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/colleges-make-sanitizers-in-their-labs/articleshow/74681310.cms
213,['18/03/2020'],‘No community transmission of Covid-19 in India so far’,"NEW DELHI: There is no community transmission of Covid-19 occurring in India as yet, India’s top health research body, ICMR, has claimed.ICMR said those with no travel history or direct contact with a Covid-19 patient, except healthcare workers, need not get tested as yet even if they exhibit symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath.The assertion of the health research body, which is developing testing and treatment protocols for Covid-19, was based on preliminary results of a random sampling exercise conducted by it in 51 virus research and diagnostic laboratories between March 1 and 15.The study involved testing 20 samples each of throat and nose swabs taken from patients admitted to government hospitals with influenza like illness and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), but having no travel history to countries affected by Covid-19 or direct contact with an infected individual.Dr Balram Bhargava, ICMR director general, said, “The results of 500 samples have arrived. All patients have tested negative for Covid-19. The remaining test results will be available on Wednesday. Based on the final outcome, we will update our protocol for testing for Covid-19. As of today, our stand is that there is no community transmission happening in India. We are still in Stage-II, where the disease is transmitted locally from an infected person with travel history to their direct contacts.”“Also, two rapid testing machines have been purchased. They can process 1,400 samples daily. We plan to buy three more of these machines to scale up testing,” Bhargava said.Asked about how the disease transmission was expected to evolve, Bhargava said nothing could be predicted. “We hope to slow down the progression of Covid-19 outbreak in India from Stage-II to Stage-III (community transmission). But we cannot say it won’t happen,” he added.On Monday, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had said that the most effective way to prevent infections and save lives was breaking the chain of transmission. And to do that, countries must test and isolate. “You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test,” he had added.Bhargava said WHO’s remark could hold true for countries such as Italy and UK, where there are 1,000 new cases daily, but not India. “As and when the situation changes, we will revise our strategy for testing,” said Dr R Gangakhedkar, chief epidemiologist at ICMR.As per the current strategy, only healthcare workers managing respiratory distress or SARI patients can be tested when they have acute respiratory illness symptoms, even if they don’t have any travel history or directed contact with a Covid-19 patient.Currently, India has 72 labs that are testing for Covid-19. By the weekend, officials said, 49 more labs of DRDO, CSIR and government medical colleges will start testing.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74683269,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-59009,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-community-transmission-of-covid-19-so-far/articleshow/74681298.cms

VISAKHAPATNAM: Visakhapatnam railway station has incurred a loss of around Rs 2 crore in the past week as the fear of coronavirus spreads in the state.

Passenger footfall at the station has also fallen to 50,000 against an average of 75,000 on regular days.

Waltair railway senior divisional commercial manager G Suneel Kumar said, “We have decided to cancel 21 special trains passing through Visakhapatnam till March-end keeping in view poor patronisation due to outbreak of Covid-19.”

Resumption of services will be announced next month depending upon the situation, said Suneel Kumar.

Sources in the Railways said occupancy rates on Godavari Express, Garib Rath, Tirumala Express, Ratnachal Express, Duranto Express and Mumbai LTT have fallen by 30 to 40 per cent, while sleeper class coaches on several trains have been running empty.

“Visakhapatnam station alone incurred a loss of Rs 2 crore in the last week due to the coronavirus scare. This was in terms of sale of passenger tickets. The loss may continue in the summer if there will is no improvement,” said a Railways source.

Meanwhile, vendors at the railway station said their businesses had taken a hit due to the coronavirus scare. “Passengers are reluctant to purchase food items and even drinking water from us due to the corona scare but we have to pay rent to the Railways in spite of our loss,” said a vendor at platform number 1.

As part of preventive measures, an isolation ward has been set up at the Railway Hospital in the city. Ambulances have been kept on standby at Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram railway stations and a reserved lounge at Visakhapatnam railway station can be used to quarantime passengers till April 15.

The Railways has also planned 200 thermal scanners to check temperatures of passengers at Visakhapatnam station, each costing Rs 16,000. There is no hike in the price of platform tickets for the time being.

People, who can’t afford cabs, public transport is the only option for them. Low-floor buses run by Jaipur City Transport Service Limited (JCTSL) are still packed with people commuting to different places.

A few commuters could be seen wearing masks but most of them are not using masks at the bus stands and inside the buses.

Ramesh Aggarwal, a daily passenger said, “I understand the risk but not everyone can afford cabs. I have to travel to Walled City as my shop is situated there and no matter what we all have to earn our livelihood.”

Fear of virus is widespread but JCTSL authorities are yet to begun sanitizing the buses where thousands of people travel every day. Veerendra Verma, officer on special duty at JCTSL, said they have already issued directions to the drivers and conductors. “We will start the process to spray disinfectants in the buses from Wednesday. Masks and gloves will be provided to them. We are taking all precautions,” said Verma.

There are hundreds of private mini-buses plying on the streets of Jaipur that are not under control of any government agencies. Mini-buses are known for rash driving and overcrowding that makes people vulnerable to disease. None of the mini-buses have been disinfected yet by any authority. President of Rajasthan Mini Buses Association, Prashant Meel assured that they are taking necessary precautions. “We have made the drivers aware about the impact of virus and its prevention. Masks have been distributed among the drivers and conductors. As the fear of coronavirus has closed down colleges, universities and offices, there is 50% decline in our number of commuters so buses are not as crowded as they used to be.

“Around 15 days back, Indian Council for Agriculture Research (ICAR) issued a notification that only those students will be allowed admission in the post-graduation courses whose universities have received accreditation from ICAR. We do not have accreditation but there is a clause that any university will receive accreditation when their one batch is passed out. Out first batch passed out in 2018. So, we are in the process of applying for accreditation,” said Bardia.

He said administration is in the process of applying but it is a gradual process. “Officials will look at the infrastructure, campus, number of teachers and courses run in our university.

One particular company however, has even floated a benefit policy exclusively for patients infected with Covid-19.Speaking to TOI, DS Raju, a senior official of a leading insurance company said, “What is happening right now is that insurance companies are selling existing health insurance highlighting entitlements for Covid 19-affected patients. This is a sheer marketing policy of selling old wine in a new bottle.”Marketing experts say owing to virus outbreaks such as Ebola, Zika and Nipah, insurance companies have begun designing policies to cover such infections. As Covid-19 is an infection, like other infections, coverage for it will be available with insurance products that cover hospitalisation costs.Coverage for in-patient treatment, pre-hospitalisation, post-hospitalisation, OPD and ambulance that a certain health insurance policy offers will be available for Covid-19 as well.TK Sarathi, a senior official of a nationalised health insurance company said, “Recently, the IRDA issued strict instructions to health insurance companies warning against rejecting claims related to coronavirus.

Dining etiquette is changing fast in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Hand sanitizers and paper tissues have started replacing finger bowls and cloth napkins. This apart, restaurants are also increasing the gap between two tables to at least 1.5m as a precautionary measure.There’s more. If you are walking in at your favourite joint anytime soon, be prepared for the mandatory temperature screening. You are allowed in only if the infrared thermometer reads normal. The Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) has convened a meeting and came up with the dos and don’ts, along with a host of other measures to keep customers and staffers safe.“No one — patrons or staff — will be allowed inside the property if the thermometer indicates that they have high temperature,” HRAEI president Pranav Singh said on Tuesday. “We have had a meeting with our members on safety against the coronavirus spread and decided to take a whole lot of measures,” he said.The restaurants have adopted stringent policies on maintaining health and hygiene. Tables, door handles and knobs will be periodically sanitized. “Guests will be asked to use hand sanitizers instead of finger bowls. And paper tissues will replace the cloth napkins,” Singh said.Even before the guidelines were issued, certain restaurants were already on a hyper-hygiene mode. “We at Chowman, Oudh 1590, Chapter 2 and Master Dimsum have been taking steps to keep the virus at bay. Our delivery persons are wearing masks and frequently using hand sanitizers,” said Shiladitya Chaudhury, partner of the chain of restaurant. Co-partner Debaditya Chaudhury said business has remained steady but noticeably lighter ever since the outbreak. “The inherent anxiety is there, but what has remained the same is people’s enthusiasm. If there’s a 10 % decline in walk-in-and-dine-in ratio, our orders through delivery have gone up considerably,” he said.On Monday, Saz on Camac Street made a hard decision to close the restaurant “with an end goal to limit the danger of Covid-19 at our restaurant as much as could be expected, we are closing down.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74684303,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-140989,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sanitizers-paper-tissues-replace-finger-bowls-napkins-at-eateries/articleshow/74681338.cms

The BMC commissioner on Tuesday discussed the proposal with block education officers and child development project officers. They were asked to tell anganwadi workers and SHG members to move from house to house and fetch not only the health details of individuals in every household, but to check if anyone from the family had visited any coronavirus-hit area inside or outside India.

The travel history of the family members and their health profile will have to be filed by the workers on a daily basis.

“The aim of using the services of anganwadi workers and SHGs is to ensure that we have the health profile and travel history of people. During the drive, the workers will sensitise people on how to maintain sanitation, especially basic things like hand washing, avoiding socializing and maintaining one metre distance from each other,” he said.

Sources in the BMC said they had identified 374 anganwadi workers for the job. They will start visiting families from Wednesday.

The BMC on Tuesday started zone-wise awareness drive by rolling out three vehicles. “The vehicles will be covered with posters. Leaflets will be distributed among the people. Emphasis will be placed on market places where people gather in numbers,” said a BMC officer.

The BMC on Monday came up with a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for wedding halls, public parks, fast food centres, roadside eateries and lassi stalls, restaurant owners, dance bars, markets and haats owned by it and the Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) and shopping malls, big commercial establishment and corporate houses.

230,['18/03/2020'],Dhoni’s India comeback looks difficult: Sehwag,"Ahmedabad: India’s former opener Virender Sehwag feels that former India skipper Mahendra Sigh Dhoni’s comeback into the Indian fold looks very difficult. The selectors have already moved forward and found replacements for Dhoni, he said.“Who will he replace? With the likes of Rishab Pant and KL Rahul already in form, especially the latter performing exceptionally well of late, I think there is no reason why should we not stick with them,’’ said the 41-year-old, who was in the city to inaugurate a sportswear store on Tuesday.On India’s dismal run in New Zealand, especially in the one-dayers and the Test series, the swashbuckling opener said the Kiwis played better than us after losing the T20I series. “We must admit that the Kiwis were superior to us in the ODIs and Tests. In the T20s, Kiwis lost close matches and in the shortest format it is always difficult to make a quick comeback,’’ he said.On Indian captain Virat Kohli’s poor form in recent times, Sehwag said Virat’s form has dipped.“He is a class batsman but that has happened to all the great batsmen in different eras be it Sachin Tendulkar, Steven Waugh, Jaques Kallis or Ricky Ponting,’’ said Sehwag.And who are the favourites for the T20 World Cup in Australia later this year? “I think in T20, one cannot predict favourites. Such is the unpredictable nature of the format, any single player can change the complexion of the game on a given day,’’ he said.“The return of Hardik Pandya will make a huge difference to the Indian team. The whole combination will change with an all-rounder of the caliber of Hardik,’’ he said.With the recent rise of teams from Gujarat in the Ranji Trophy, Sehwag said most of the traditional powerhouses were going through a transition period. However sides like Saurashtra, Gujarat and Bengal have their key players available throughout the Ranji season and as a result they are more consistent and able to play better than others. For example, Delhi miss players of the stature of Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan, Rishab Pant and Ishant Sharma, who are mostly on national duty and are unavailable for their side in domestic competitions. Whenever top players have played the domestic season for Delhi, the team has at least reached the semifinals.’’Sehwag has fond memories of Ahmedabad where he slammed the last century of his Test career at the Sardar Patel Stadium at Motera. “I vividly remember my last Test century against Alistair Cook-led England at Motera.

In absence of cloverleaf structure, which ensures the connectivity to the highway and the transport corridor of Ring Road, the project remained non-operational even after its inauguration.

At Agra Road, the work was stalled as the JDA had to acquire 3,200 square metre land from a petrol pump that is obstructing the construction of the structure. After receiving the directions from the state government, the JDA will now provide land in Chitrakoot Nagar sector-4 as compensation.

An official said, “We have identified 1,100 sq metre land which will be allotted to the affected owner. The proposal was sent to the state government as JDA at its level cannot decide if compensation is provided in other zone,” he said.

The project is two years late as JDA failed to acquire land till date. A senior JDA official said, “After signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), the JDA was liable to provide 26 hectare land for flyover construction by August 2018. However, the acquisition process was pending after many hurdles emerged.”

According to sources, the NHAI will spend Rs 238 crore to construct cloverleaf and flyovers. The JDA has earlier proposed an overbridge to cross Tonk Road. Similarly, construction of cloverleaf interchanges was proposed on Agra and Ajmer roads.

“The land at other places has already been acquired. The final hurdle was cleared,” said source.

The JDA on June 19, 2018 signed a supplementary memorandum of understanding (MoU) with NHAI, after it agreed to provide Rs 200 crore in advance to acquire 26 hectares of land. The funds were transferred in JDA’s account to acquire land for the construction of cloverleaf and flyovers under the 47-km Ring Road project. As per the contract condition, the JDA had to acquire land within one month and provide it to NHAI. However, the civic body failed to adhere to the condition as it took over one-and-a-half years.

239,['18/03/2020'],The Whitefield entrepreneur multiplying B-school chances,"Shubhi.Mehrotra@timesgroup.com

Bengaluru: A robust resume, exhaustive essays , letters of recommendation and a nerve-wracking interview — it takes more than just perfect scores for MBA aspirants to make a mark on admission committees of foreign universities. A city-based entrepreneur makes it easier.

For eight years, Whitefield resident Namita Garg, 43, has been mentoring business school aspirants through her admissions consulting firm, MBA Decoder. She and her team of three senior consultants handhold candidates through the challenging application process , one step at a time. “B-school applications are highly competitive. For instance, European B-school INSEAD is a melting pot with students from 90 nationalities,” Namita says.

She adds: “Committees look for applicants with leadership skills. Therefore, candidates must demonstrate their ability to take initiatives, drive people, manage stakeholders and make tangible impact to their organisations. While aspirants understand this, it’s difficult to coherently translate it on paper. This is where we come into the picture.” Her clients are professionals with 2-15 years of work experience, who wish to pursue MBA to advance their careers or change track.

“We begin by coaching them to think like leaders. Most applicants have a sketchy understanding of what leadership is. We make them aware of their strengths and weaknesses. We help convey it on paper by strategically telling their life stories through a resume, essays, letters of recommendation and interview. The process is highly introspective as applicants need to comb through their entire lives. They end up discovering themselves and we end up learning a lot from the gritty, driven achievers,” elaborates Namita.

A mother of two with experience in marketing and client servicing, she was bitten by the entrepreneurial bug in 2011 when she wanted to begin a new professional innings. “I had taken long leave from work between late 2005 and 2007 to bring up my daughters. We were in the US and my husband decided to pursue an MBA. Since I wasn’t employed, I offered to help him with the application. I read voraciously on the subject and became his best critic,” she says. “We moved across continents when my husband joined London Business School in 2007. His roommate connected me to the consulting firm he had approached. I worked with them but felt they lacked a personalised approach while dealing with candidates. However, the exposure kindled my interest in the field.”

In 2010, they relocated to India and that’s her new plans began to take shape. “Having seen the average quality of services provided to Indian aspirants, I decided to venture into the space,” she recalls.

But is it a niche area? “In the US, it’s very common to approach admission consultants. In India, applicants are slowly warming up to it, thanks to the vast pool of information available online. I’ve been lucky in getting clients through word of mouth. However, I don’t believe in the numbers game and work with a few applicants every year but in an intensely collaborative way,” Namita says. Pointing out that it can get taxing during application season, she adds: “Thankfully, I don’t have to negotiate Bengaluru’s crippling traffic as I work from home. But my biggest challenge is to stay relevant. I don’t advertise on online platforms, so I am constantly present on MBA admission forums advising applicants pro-bono. It gives me the satisfaction of sharing my knowledge built over 10 years. Secondly, my work is very labour intensive so scaling up can be an issue as I’m quite wary of hiring people.”

241,['18/03/2020'],Covid-19 is Telangana’s overriding concern,"HYDERABAD: Amid growing concerns over spread of coronavirus, doctors at several government hospitals are demanding a cap on the number of outpatients (OP). In this regard, hospitals are considering sending text messages to patients, whose contacts are available on the database, to not visit the hospital unless it is absolutely urgent. Hospitals are also arranging for tele-consultations.“Crowded elective OPD (out patient departments) in all hospitals should be shut down and only emergencies should be attended. I request the director of medical education to ensure that only emergencies come to hospitals,” said resident medical officer at the government ENT Hospital in Koti, Dr Manish Gupta. The ENT Hospital, in recent days, has seen a spike in number of outpatients with the numbers increasing each day, according to hospital sources.While the ENT Hospital has seen a spike, the patient flow at Gandhi Hospital — the nodal centre for treating positive coronavirus cases — has seen a sharp decline in OP since the first positive case was reported in the state. On Tuesday, only 450 patients had visited the hospital as compared to the daily average of over 2,000 patients.“Hospitals should SMS patients to not visit the hospital with fever and cough, unless it is absolutely urgent. Arrangements should be made by hospital for tele-consultation to determine whether such patients should visit the hospital. All patients with cough and fever should be provided a surgical mask at the reception and should get priority,” said president of Association of Surgeons of India, Dr P Raghu Ram.Speaking about the challenge that lies ahead for hospitals and doctors, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Telangana general secretary Dr Sanjeev Singh Yadav said that a move to restrict the number of patients is an ideal one.“From the hospitals point of view, it is good to restrict patients (from) coming and getting affected...While routine things need to be deferred, a patient has to be seen by a doctor to ascertain whether or not it is an emergency. For instance, an unwanted ultrasound should be deferred but a pregnant woman needs to be checked. Patients should first go to a local clinic or doctor to get an assessment and if suggested, go to a bigger hospital,” Dr Yadav said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74683260,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-376761,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/docs-demand-limiting-number-of-outpatients/articleshow/74681473.cms
242,['18/03/2020'],Govt: CAA not an answer to all religious persecution in world,"NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday responded to petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the Supreme Court, asserting that it was a narrowly tailored law addressing problems in grant of citizenship to some communities persecuted on the basis of religion in neighbouring Islamic countries and assured it did not impact citizenship of Indians.

Countering the allegation that CAA was discriminatory as it did not consider grant of citizenship to persecuted minority communities like Ahmadis, Shias, Bahaiis, Hazaras, Jews and Balochs, the Centre said, “CAA does not seek to recognise or seek to provide answers to all kinds of purported persecution that may be taking place across the world or that may have taken place previously anywhere in the world. CAA is a narrowly tailored legislation seeking to address the specific problem which awaited India’s attention for a solution since several decades.”

Its 129-page affidavit termed CAA as a benign piece of legislation which seeks to provide a relaxation, in the nature of an amnesty, to specific communities from specified countries with a clear cut-off date. Terming its bulky affidavit as a “preliminary reply”, the Centre said CAA’s key mode of classification was identification of six communities — Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis and Christians — to provide them a limited exemption under the CAA.

The Centre's affdiavit in the Supreme Court said Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh had Islam as state religion with “acknowledged religious persecution”.

“History clearly depicts that persecuted minorities in the said three countries were left without any rights and the said historical injustice is sought to be remedied by the amendment without taking away or whittling down the right of any other person,” the Centre said. It added, “CAA does not impinge upon any existing right that may have existed prior to enactment of the amendment and further, in no manner whatsoever seeks to affect the legal, democratic or secular rights of any Indian citizen.”

It said the existing regime for obtaining Indian citizenship remained untouched by CAA and “legal migration, on the basis of valid documents and visa, continues to be permissible from all countries of the world, including Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh”.

“All foreigners, irrespective of their religion and living in these three countries or any other country, can legally migrate to India subject to fulfilment of conditions mentioned in the Citizenship Act, 1955, apply for and get Indian citizenship if found eligible,” the Centre said.

Referring to scores of pleas filed by politicians, rights activists and even state governments to challenge the CAA, the Centre said it amounted to misuse of PIL instrument created by the SC for benefit of poor and downtrodden who have no voice or access to court. “Matters concerning the sovereign plenary power of Parliament, especially in regard to citizenship and the contours thereof, cannot be questioned before the SC by way of a public interest petition,” it said.

“The cardinal principle of locus standi has been diluted by this (PIL) jurisprudence evolved by the SC only in limited fact situations which cannot be extrapolated to include the present constitutional challenge to the legislative measure of the Indian Parliament in the domain of issues concerning citizenship/immigration,” it added.

On the petitioners’ reference to alleged violation of international covenants, and the purported move by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights seeking to be amicus in the SC, the Centre said, “India is neither a signatory nor has ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention or the 1967 Protocol on Territorial Asylum .”

“The fundamental rights provisions of the Constitution, in the context of this case Articles 14 and 21, cannot be interpreted with reference to any international convention or treaty to which India is neither a signatory not it has ratified the same.” the Centre said. Assertion of petitioners that the principle of non-refoulement (non return of refugees) is a part of customary international law is erroneous in law.

“The principle of non-refoulement cannot be derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.”

243,['18/03/2020'],Gujarat HC nod to sale of shops by Hindus to Muslims in disturbed area,"AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has granted permission to sale of shops by Hindus to Muslims in a Vadodara area, where the state government has imposed the Disturbed Areas Act. The HC said that the authorities do not have to verify except the free will of the seller and fair price of the property, that it is not a distress sale and without fear.

In this case, the authorities denied permission for sale of the properties by Hindus to Muslims on consideration that it would reduce the strength of Hindu traders in the area. This happened after the initiation of a police inquiry whether law and order would be disturbed if Muslims purchase properties in the area, which falls under the Gujarat Prohibition of Transfer of Immovable Property and Provisions of Tenants from Eviction from Premises in Disturbed Areas Act, 1991, which requires prior permission for sale/purchase of properties involving people belonging to different faiths.

The high court has quashed the orders by Vadodara deputy collector and the secretary denying permission to sale/purchase of properties by two brothers Dinesh and Deepakbhai Modi to Muslim traders Onali Dholkawala and Iqbal Tinwala . In 2016, they went to register the sale deed, but realizing that it is Disturbed Area, they applied for permission from deputy collector.

The deputy collector ordered Vadodara police commissioner to probe whether the sale is with free consent; there is a likelihood of law and order problem; the sale is likely to affect the balance in the majority Hindu/minority Muslim strength; and to affect the neighbourhood.

The police reported that purchase of shops by Muslims from Hindus will disturb the balance between the communities’ trade strength. On the basis of this report, the authorities – the deputy collector and then the secretary – denied permission for sale.

The Muslim purchasers approached the HC, which observed that the invocation of Disturbed Areas Act may be with a view to bringing order, but the prime question of adjudication for authorities in sale/purchase of properties is to ascertain whether it is not a distress sale, and that the transaction is bona fide and free-willed. “The object to get into such sale consideration is not to see whether it would create a law and order problem…” the court said and termed the inquiry against the law.

RAJKOT: Close to 150 students from Gujarat are stranded in a city near Philippines capital Manila after the government of India suspended flights to several coronavirus-hit countries including those in Southeast Asia.

The Philippines is the one of the worst-affected countries by Covid-19 and President Rodrigo Duterte has declared a state of calamity for a period of six months after 12 deaths and nearly 142 positive cases.

According to Indians residing there, the government has shut down Manila and its surrounding cities since March 12. The country gave 72 hours starting Monday evening local time to foreign citizens to leave the country.

Saytayjeetsinh Rana, a native of Surendranagar, who is stranded there told TOI over phone, “We are stranded as flights to Malaysia and Singapore , which are the most preferred route to fly to India, have been suspended. Some students who left are stuck in Malaysia. We have approached Indian embassy and requested for evacuation, but there has been no response yet.”

Limited food stock with stranded students

Milind Patel, a student from Godhra , said, “There are nearly 150 Gujarati students in our college. We are very scared due to the spreading epidemic. We are vegetarians and the food stock is also limited.”

Milind and Rana are MBBS students at University of Perpetual Help System DALTA in the City of Las Piñas, roughly 27 km from Manila. The duo live in a rented apartment with four other students.

Rana’s father Girirajsinh told TOI, “Initially, our children did not tell us the seriousness of the situation as they didn’t want us to worry. They were trying to return but when all the options were closed, they informed us today noon. I am contacting other parents after which we will approach the government for help.”

Students said that the city has been locked down and curfew declared during the night time. The educational institutes are shut till April 12 and this may be extended too.

Some students are also facing visa extension problems as they have to renew it every year.

246,['18/03/2020'],Naroda factory fire: 'Culpable homicide charge not tenable’,"Seven employees lost their lives in Narol factory fire on February 8.

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday observed that the fire officer’s charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and the SC/ST atrocity against the owners of Chiripal Industries are not tenable for the factory fire in Narol , which resulted in death of seven employees on February 8.

After the shirting section in Nandan Denim Company caught fire and seven employees including one belonging to the Scheduled Caste were killed, the father-son duo – Jyotiprasad Chiripal and Deepak Chiripal — along with employees of the company were booked under section 304 of the IPC and the SC/ST Atrocity Act. The duo challenged the invocation of these charges and the FIR itself.

After preliminary hearing, Justice S H Vora stayed arrest of both the accused and observed that there did not appear any intention on part of the accused to cause accident to kill the employees. The court issued notice to the government, which has accused them of not making provisions of any escape for employees despite recurrence of fire incidents in the industrial units, and sought reply by September. The investigation will continue and the accused will be cooperating with it meanwhile, the HC said.

In his order, Justice Vora said, “Here is a case, where there is neither allegation as to guilty intention nor guilty knowledge on the part of the applicants.

The invocation of Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code r/w section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act on the face of the FIR even if taken at its face value and then accepted it in entirety, do not prima facie disclose commission of offence either u/s 304 of the Indian Penal Code r/w section 3(2)(v) of the SC/ST Act. So, in view of overall facts of the case leading to filing of the impugned FIR, present application deserves consideration.”

247,['18/03/2020'],Lonely in time of corona: Elders fear further isolation,"NEW DELHI: Mohammad Zakir had to cancel his annual trip to his native town just two days before the scheduled departure. The 72-year-old, a resident of Janakpuri, retired over a decade ago and settled with his children in Delhi. But every year, he goes back to his hometown for a fortnight.“My children insisted that I drop that plan this time. They also convinced me to stay at home and I am not even going out for the Friday prayers. But I know it’s important to be safe right now. Prevention is the key,” Zakir told TOI.The most vulnerable demographic group — those aged 70 and above — is also facing piercing emotional challenges in the times of Covid-19. Cancelled plans and indefinite stay on social activities have resulted in a heightened sense of anxiety and fear of further isolation among the elderly.Several old-age homes, NGOs and collectives are stepping up their efforts to raise awareness among the elderly about the pandemic. Himanshu Rath, Founder Agewell Foundation, which has been working with senior citizens since 1999, told TOI that the not-for-profit organisation has been crowdsourcing face masks and distributing it to the elderly.“We have distributed over 1,300 masks so far, but plan to give out over 5,000. We know masks are just symbolic, but for those who can’t afford them, they offer a psychological comfort. The biggest problem right now is that people living alone are extremely disturbed. They keep asking us what would happen to them if they contract the virus,” Rath said.The number of calls on Agewell’s helpline has also doubled. “We used to get at least 50 calls every day. But yesterday, there were more than 100 calls, with most callers seeking information on the symptoms and cure,” he said.Hena Faqurudheen, a mental health professional who works with the elderly and specialises in geriatric mental health, said there was “heightened anxiety”. She said: “A lot of the elderly patients’ children are abroad. So, there is already some level of loneliness that they are coping with. Most of them depend on emergency support and social support network groups to deal with their feelings. But with the fear of the virus, these gatherings have also taken a hit. And now, the elders don’t have anyone to talk to.”Mathew Cherian, CEO of Helpage India, another NGO that works with the elderly, pointed out the complete absence of outlets where the elderly can speak of their fears.“We have told people to stay inside their homes and not go out unnecessarily. But we deal with people who belong to the lowest socio-economic category. They do not even have the money to buy daily essentials. So, they can’t stock up on food items or vegetables,” he said. Cherian added that the elderly population was going through a lot of “trauma” because of Covid-19.The NGO, which runs shelter homes, has started awareness programmes where it educates the elderly on the symptoms of Covid-19. They have also issued an advisory to the authorities to keep people in isolation in case they display any symptoms related to the virus.JR Gupta, chair of the confederation of senior citizens’ associations of Delhi, an umbrella body of 18 lakh elderly people, told TOI that their main philosophy right now is “prevention is better than cure”.He said: “We are raising awareness and conducting programmes to assure people that they are not alone.

The results will be declared based on the aggregate of previous examinations and current class performance. Meanwhile, the books for the new academic year have been made available on the school premises.

We are worried about children as they sit close together in the classrooms. We hope the government gives orders on closure of schools.”Speaking to TOI, Visakhapatnam district educational officer (DEO) B Lingeswara Reddy said, “We have not received any orders from the state government regarding the closure of schools.

UDAIPUR: A 52-year old man strangulated his wife to death in Sector 14 and later committed suicide by hanging himself at his rented house under Goverdhan Vilas police station area.

Sunil Soni killed Suman (38) on Monday night suspecting her of having an extramarital affair. Thereafter, he hanged himself, police said.

Police found a suicide note scribbled on one of the walls in which Sunil held one Uma Shanker alias Senti Banna responsible for their deaths.

“Uma Shankar lives in the same locality and is known to the couple. We will investigate his role in the case. Prima facie, Sunil doubted his wife so much that he didn’t like her stepping out of the house or speaking to anyone,” said Chena Ram, SHO, Goverdhan Vilas police station.

The house owner spotted the bodies on Tuesday morning.

Sunil hailed from Ajmer and undertook painting jobs for a livelihood while Suman worked as a cook in an ashram, sources said.

The couple was living in the house for 4-5 years. They didn’t have any children and quarrelled frequently. A few weeks ago, they had filed complaints against each other at the mahila thana but later withdrew them.

There were strangulation marks on the woman’s neck, police said, adding that broken pieces of bangles were recovered from the bed where the body was found. The bodies have been sent for a post-mortem, the officer said.

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has refused to intervene in the schedule of National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for UG, 2020 after a student pursuing medical studies abroad missed deadline to apply.

Khushi Shah from Surat approached the HC and requested for permission to sit in the NEET exam that is scheduled on May 3. She sought HC directions to the National Testing Agency because she missed the deadline for online registration. She told the court that she is studying medicine in Georgia at present. Therefore, she was not aware of the NEET schedule and missed registration in time.

Shah told the court that the deadline for online registration was postponed on various occasions from December 31, 2019 to February 9, 2020. She missed the step-1 deadline. Though the window was open for correction, she could not register herself.

The central government vehemently opposed the student’s petition and submitted that a public notice was issued announcing NEET schedule. Moreover, the apex court has ordered to strictly adhere the timeline of medical exams and admissions.

After hearing the case, the HC said, “On one hand, the authorities are bound to follow the time schedule, on the other, the students are also duty bound to abide by the dates prescribed so as to ensure that the entire process is not delayed.”

It further said though the court has all consideration towards the student who missed online registration by a whisker, considering the enormity of the task assigned to the National Testing Agency wherein about 16 lakh candidates have registered for NEET 2020 examination, “it will not be in the fitness of things to grant the prayer as sought for in the present petition”.

UDAIPUR: A 52-year old man strangulated his wife to death in Sector 14 and later committed suicide by hanging himself at his rented house under Goverdhan Vilas police station area.

Sunil Soni killed Suman (38) on Monday night suspecting her of having an extramarital affair. Thereafter, he hanged himself, police said.

Police found a suicide note scribbled on one of the walls in which Sunil held one Uma Shanker alias Senti Banna responsible for their deaths.

“Uma Shankar lives in the same locality and is known to the couple. We will investigate his role in the case. Prima facie, Sunil doubted his wife so much that he didn’t like her stepping out of the house or speaking to anyone,” said Chena Ram, SHO, Goverdhan Vilas police station.

The house owner spotted the bodies on Tuesday morning.

Sunil hailed from Ajmer and undertook painting jobs for a livelihood while Suman worked as a cook in an ashram, sources said.

The couple was living in the house for 4-5 years. They didn’t have any children and quarrelled frequently. A few weeks ago, they had filed complaints against each other at the mahila thana but later withdrew them.

There were strangulation marks on the woman’s neck, police said, adding that broken pieces of bangles were recovered from the bed where the body was found. The bodies have been sent for a post-mortem, the officer said.

AHMEDABAD: Eleven years after her retirement, the Gujarat high court ordered the state government to grant promotion to the post of deputy collector in a case of a mamlatdar who was denied promotion over a mistake committed in passing order in land title matters.

The case involves one K R Joshi, who retired in 2009 as a mamlatdar and in 2015, the government decided to deduct Rs 1,000 from her pension amount towards penalty. Justice A S Supehia not only ordered to grant her due promotion with effect from 2007, when she was superseded, the government has also been ordered to pay her the arrears by increasing her salary. The government will also have to refund the money deducted from her pension towards penalty, said Joshi’s advocate Sharvil Majmudar.

In ordering back-dated promotion for Joshi, the HC made important observation that that if a revenue officer while working as a quasi-judicial authority commits an error and there is no element of mala fide involved in passing orders pertaining to land title, the officer’s gesture does not fall within parameters of misconduct. While working as mamlatdar in Nadiad , Joshi passed certain orders by treating tenants as permanent tenants. The government thought that her decision caused the exchequer a loss of over Rs 64 lakh. The order was against the two resolutions adopted by the state government. This led to an inquiry, in which she was exonerated. But the authorities still considered her guilty and imposed penalty. She was not granted promotion also.

261,['18/03/2020'],Odisha: Aahaar centres tweak timings for social distancing,"BHUBANESWAR: The state government on Tuesday implemented social distancing norms at its subsidized food canteens or Aahaar centres.

People queuing up for the cheap meals will have to stand 1.5 metre apart. The government has also tweaked the lunch timing. Food will be served from 10 am to 4 pm, instead of the usual noon to 3 pm. The move is meant to avoid overcrowding inside the centres. The government would also take the help of police or home guards to force people, if needed, to maintain the required distance from each other, said the official order issued by principal secretary (housing and urban and development).

Each Aahaar centre will install a sink at the entrance and provide liquid soap or soap bars for people to wash their hands before they join the queue for food. Temporary handwash counters, usually installed during weddings and other functions, are expected to be hired for this purpose.

The government also said steps would be taken to de-congest the Aahaar centres. People will be asked to take their food-laden plates outside the centres, finish eating and then place the plates in bins. To reduce physical contact, the persons might be asked to put their money in a box and collect a token for the food. The centres have to be cleaned rigorously and sanitised using disinfectants.

When TOI visited several Aahaar centres in the city a couple of hours after the issue of the notification, it did not find the rules to be implemented. Some of the centres had not opened even after 11.30 am and people were standing close to each other in queues.

“We have not received any order from the government so far, so we opened our centre as usual at noon. The guidelines will be implemented from tomorrow (Wednesday),” said an employee at an Aahaar centre near the Bhubaneswar railway station.

The state has a total of 157 Aahaar centres.

262,['18/03/2020'],Quite a stretch: Bus commuters clueless about social distancing,"Commuters rushed in groups to board buses on Tuesday, maintaining no distance from the next person

PANAJI/MAPUSA: Even as the government has been urging citizens to practice social distancing to contain the spread of Covid-19, commuters at interstate bus stands seem oblivious to the infection threat.

Every time a bus pulled into the bus stand, commuters were seen rushing, in groups, to board it— maintaining no distance from the next person, seemingly more keen on getting into the bus first to bag a window seat, than avoiding the spread of germs.

Hardly anybody at the ticket booking counters at the KTC bus stands at Mapusa and Panaji wore face masks, while fewer passengers covered their face with either mask or handkerchief.

Even as the state transport department had announced that all bus stands would be sanitised regularly, the Mapusa bus stand is yet to be sanitised, and looked as unhygienic as any other day, with waste collecting in its corners.

Saraswati and five members of her family, including a toddler, arrived in Goa from Solapur, Maharashtra, on Tuesday. The family was waiting to board a bus at the Mapusa bus stand that would take them to Sakhali, where they sell toys. The lone man in the group, her young brother-in-law, was covering his mouth and nose with a black mask. “I have my dupatta,” said Saraswati, holding up a soiled dupatta.

All the benches around her were occupied, and she in the dirt. Even if she understands the science of how the virus spreads, does she have a wherewithal to take care?

Another woman seated on the floor of the Mapusa bus stand, 65-year-old Gangubai (name changed), prepares her paan as she waits for her bus home. Ask her about her precautions against the virus, she retorts, “Kon go thaey bai. Haav na olkhona?” (Who is corona? I don’t know her).

Fifty-something Malti Kudchadkar has heard about Covid-19 and that the virus has killed thousands of people. Sharing the narrow bench with several other travellers, she is more anxious about her bus being delayed than her potential exposure to the infection.

Nitin Shah, 64, stated in his FIR that on March 9, he had received an email from an unknown person who had said that if Shah did not give his Aadhaar card details, his phone services would be disconnected.

On March 12 evening, the services on Shah’s phone were disrupted. When he went to the telecom company’s outlet in Navrangpura, he found that somebody had closed the services of the old sim and had obtained a new sim of the same number. Later, the accused withdrew Rs 16 lakh through netbanking from Shah’s account.

Police sources said that through the Aadhaar information, the fraudsters got Shah’s banking details. As Shah’s old sim card had been suspended, he did not get any messages alerting him to transactions.

265,['18/03/2020'],DCW rescues five children from placement agency,"Image used for representational purpose only

NEW DELHI: Delhi Commission for Women has rescued five children belonging to UP, Odisha and Chattisgarh from outer Delhi’s Nihal Vihar. They had been brought to Delhi by a placement agency on the pretext of a vacation or for sending them to school.

An NGO working in the area called DCW’s 181 helpline and informed the commission about the illegal acts of the agency. DCW dispatched its team immediately to the spot and reached the address in the presence of police.

The team found that seven children were staying at the placement agency. The children were very scared and were not in a condition to speak. The owner of the agency was also present at the time of visit at the office.

Police and the DCW team brought the children and the owner of the agency to Nihal Vihal police station for further investigation. DCW chief Swati Maliwal also counselled the children and after interacting with them late on Monday night, demanded an FIR in the matter.

It was learnt that one of the children is a 13-year-old orphan who hails from Unnao in Uttar Pradesh. His aunt had sent him to Delhi saying that the people were taking him for admitting him to a school. The child had been living at the placement agency’s office for a month.

The youngest girl is five-years-old and belongs to Sundergarh District . The girl informed the team that she had come to Delhi with her mother two days ago and that she had left her at the agency’s office.

Apart from this, two children were brought to Delhi on the pretext of taking them for a vacation. Another woman, who is 20-years-old, had been working in Delhi for the past one year through the placement agency and was allegedly not allowed to talk to her family and was not paid her dues.

“It was observed that all the children had been brought to Delhi by luring and deceiving them. It was also found that the agency’s owner’s husband is already charged with a rape case and is behind bars for the same. All the children were sent to a shelter home after undergoing medical examination. The children have been presented before the Child Welfare Committee,” Maliwal said.

She added, “A huge human trafficking racket is being run in Delhi in the name of placement agencies. Children are being lured to Delhi from small towns and villages and being put to work. They are so young that they are not even able to tell about their family and their age. At this tender age, these children are being exploited and pushed into labour. It is absolutely intolerable and we appeal to all the governments to make strict laws for the regulation of these placement agencies as soon as possible. We want police to file an FIR, arrest the culprits and get the children safely to their homes. In addition, the children who are orphans also need to be rehabilitated.”

VIJAYAWADA: State election commissioner N Ramesh Kumar on Tuesday said the election process for local and civic bodies will be resumed only after getting an assurance from the national task force on Covid-19 or the Union ministry of health.

In a reply to the letter written by chief secretary Nilam Sawhney, he said the decision to put off the poll process by six weeks was taken in view of the coronavirus threat.

Sawhney had written to the election body chief on Monday, urging him to revoke the postponement order and hold elections as per the earlier schedule as the Covid-19 situation in the state was under control.

Referring to the contention that the state will lose central funds if polls are not held by March 31, Kumar said he worked as finance secretary prior to his stint in the state. “Release of funds to local bodies (basic grant and performance grant) and holding of elections to local bodies is one of the conditions. In the past, the state government was able to successfully access withheld funds after holding elections,” he said, and added that the election commission will support the AP government’s efforts to access central funds through any requisite documentation from their end.

“Based on my experience, release of basic grant is on a more flexible terrain and performance grant has different parameters. But since AP is not alone in the present situation, the states, in a similar situation, can make a common pleading. On my part, l will vouch for the state’s and our collective efforts,” he added.

Pointing out that coronavirus is a circumstance beyond anticipation, he said the states of Maharashtra, West Bengal and Odisha have also put local body elections on hold. “In fact, all election commissions to my knowledge have deferred the holding of bye-polls. Bihar is one such example,” he stated.

“AP is not alone at the present juncture facing the Covid-19 challenge. All state election commissioners are accessing World Health Organisation (WHO) warnings and the Union health ministry’s guidelines. I have a duty to safeguard the high Constitutional status of the commission as well as to clear the air about its conscious and objective decision-making process.”

He further said that in the absence of scientific data for which no one can be faulted, the chief secretary may refer the case to the national task force set up by the central government to revisit the issue.

“As on Tuesday, 428 people are under home quarantine in Surat city and are being constantly monitored as per government guidelines,’’ said Dr. Ashish Naik, deputy municipal commissioner (health), SMC. Besides the student, there is another person who has been kept in isolation ward of a hospital in Surat.

Health department officials said samples of the suspected coronavirus patient have been sent to Ahmedabad for test. His test report is expected soon.

“We have 70 beds in isolation ward in civil and private hospitals and about 150 quarantine beds in the district. We plan to increase the quarantine beds to 500,” Dr Nilesh Patel, epidemic medical officer, Bharuch, told TOI.

In Tapi district, about 18 non-resident Gujaratis (NRGs) were under home quarantine for 14 days. “Of the 18 NRGs, home quarantine has ended for 14 people. Four persons are still under home quarantine,” said Dr. Harshad Patel, chief district health officer (CDHO), Tapi district.

“We have created a special six bed isolation ward for suspected coronavirus patients.

Officials said that textile units manufacturing unstitched lehenga were clearing their stock having sale value exceeding Rs 1,000 showing them as ‘sari cloth’. The unit owners were paying 5% GST instead of the actual 12% on the unstitched lehenga, thereby evading tax of Rs 11 crore since July 2017.

The officials had raided the Krishna fabrics at Umarwada, Abhivandan designers, Shree Swagat NX, Braj Gopi creations and Namo Navkar collections located at Bombay market.

During the search operation, DGGI officials seized incriminating documents indicating evasion of GST to the tune of Rs 11 crore. A total of Rs 3.60 crore was voluntarily deposited by the textile unit owners with the assurance to deposit rest of the evasion amount in the stipulated time frame.

In the second case, the DGGI conducted search operation at MCC Concrete at Vadodara regarding the evasion of service tax. During the search it was found that the unit was registered with the department and was paying Central Excise duty on the clearance of ready-mix concrete, but was not paying service tax. A total of Rs 1.40 crore worth of service tax was evaded against which the company paid Rs 25 lakh.

Patel’s announcement came in response to a supplementary question by BJD’s Sasmit Patra during question hour in Rajya Sabha.

Besides the 17 iconic sites announced last year, two more — one from Gujarat and Konark Temple — have been included in the list taking the total number to 19. “I have received letters from Odisha chief minister, Union petroleum minister and from other delegates in this regard,” Patel said in his reply.

With inclusion of the 13th century shrine in the iconic tourism site list, the Centre would release money for overall development of the tourism site, which attracts tourists from across the globe.

The Union government, in the annual budget 2019-20, had announced a list of 17 iconic tourism sites to develop them into world-class tourism destinations while not a single tourism site from the state was included in the list. The issue had triggered a political war of words.

The Union minister also said they will soon take a call on the issue of removing sand from the ASI-protected monument. The sand filling was done by the British in 1903 to provide stability to the monument. The discussion to remove sand from the monument was held at a national conference on conservation of the temple that was also attended by the minister.

Replying to a question from Khadia MLA Imran Khedawala, the state government said that between February 1, 2019, and January 31, 2020, 2,32,720 documents were registered with the government. In 2018, the figure was 2,31,925 in the same period.

In 2019, there was a marginal increase of 795 documents. The government said that the use of the online payment facility is still to pick up. Of the 2.33 lakh documents registered in 2019, the payments for only 8,204 were done electronically.

The government said that the income in 2019 registered a decline of 1.4%. Between February 1, 2019, and January 31, 2020, the income received for the registration of the documents was Rs 359.34 crore. The figure in 2018 was Rs 364.59 crore in the same period.

The officials said the documents registered were of the properties whose possession is being given now. The officials said that though the increase is marginal, the Ahmedabad property market has been able to maintain sales despite the market conditions.

“Given the slowdown pressures in the real estate market over the past two years, registrations should have been lower,” said Ajay Patel, president, GIHED-CREDAI. “However, the number, on the contrary, is marginally higher. That is a good sign for the real estate industry. It shows that demand exists.”

AHMEDABAD: With government efforts raising awareness about the Covid-19 pandemic, eateries have taken a hit as citizens have become reluctant to visit spaces frequented by large numbers of strangers, which have have higher risks of cross-contamination and infection.

With malls and multiplexes temporarily shut down and the government advising people to stay indoors and try to remotely work from home, footfalls at restaurants and eateries across the city dropped by at least 30% over the last 7-10 days. Even the numbers of takeaway orders have declined. Citizens have begun to prefer the relative isolation of their homes and the peace of mind provided by home-cooked food.

“The footfalls have gone down by at least 30%. Even though all restaurants are taking extra precautions and ensuring hygiene measures, customers are clearly avoiding restaurants,” said Rajmohan Modi , a city-based restaurateur.

Many restaurants have amped up hygiene measures, right from encouraging staffers to wash hands more frequently to keeping hand sanitizers on tables and upping sanitation and waste segregation.

“We have kept sanitizers on each table and are taking extra precautions to ensure that our water and food quality is maintained at par with standards. We have also ensured our staff members wear gloves and masks while serving food,” said Dilip Thakkar, partner of a city-based restaurant.

Surat: Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) will hold personal hearing of residents of 198 buildings obstructing runway path of aircraft landing and taking off from Surat airport here on March 19.

DGCA officials will be arriving on March 19 after Union civil aviation ministry directed them to conduct hearing in Surat.

Earlier, DGCA had asked owners and society presidents of buildings facing demolition under section 6 of aircraft rules, 1994 to remain present on March 4 at its deputy director’s office in Mumbai for personal hearing.

In December 2019 in a public interest litigation, Gujarat high court had ordered Centre, Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) to look into the issue of unauthorized construction near the airport. Builders and residents of 48 projects had approached the high court.

DGCA’s personal hearing is being organized after the high court’s order to authorities to take up the building height obstruction issue seriously. It had criticised inaction on the part of AAI and SMC after issuing notices for demolition of buildings which do not even have building use permission (BUC).

An officer of AAI said, “Residents and builders of affected buildings have been summoned for personal hearing on March 19. Before conducting the final hearing with regard to obstacles to flight path of the aircraft, DGCA will like to meet the residents.”

Removal of obstacles on approach surface of runway-22 at Vesu side will pave the way for clearing displacement of 615 metres imposed by DGCA. This means an aircraft landing from Vesu side will be able to use the full length runway of 2,905 metres, instead of current 2,290 metres.

Sources said the survey of buildings obstructing the flight path within 6.6 kilometres on the approach funnel of runway at Vesu end was done in 2018. About 198 buildings of 48 projects were identified as violators of permissible top elevation and coordinate rules.

286,['18/03/2020'],Exports of lab-grown diamond up 60% in Feb amid Covid-19,"Surat: At a time when coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong and China has taken the sheen out of Surat's famed natural polished diamonds, cheap lab-grown diamonds seem to have become best friend of consumers in the United States and Dubai.

While exports of natural polished diamonds have declined by almost 41% in February, exports of lab-grown diamonds registered a 60% increase during the same month.

According to figures provided by Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), exports of lab-grown polished diamonds increased by 60% to Rs265 crore in February 2020 compared to Rs166 during the same month in previous year. However, total exports of lab-grown diamonds between April-February 2020 increased by 102% to Rs2,800 crore compared to Rs1,370 crore during the same period in previous year.

On the other hand, exports of polished diamonds in February 2020 declined by 41% at Rs9,800 crore compared to Rs16,600 crore during the same month in previous year. Overall exports of polished diamonds between April-February 2020 declined by 19% to Rs1.24 lakh crore compared to Rs1.53 lakh crore during the same period in previous year.

Industry sources said majority of lab-grown diamonds are exported to the US, where many leading jewellery brands like Zales, Kay, Jared and Signet Jewellers sell lab-grown diamonds from their stores and online platforms. Majority of lab-grown diamonds are cut and polished in Surat and the raw material is sourced from China and Singapore.

Lab-grown Diamond and Jewellery Promotion Council (LGDJPC) chairman Shashikant Shah told TOI, “If consumers don’t get diamonds cheaper, they will buy lab-grown diamonds. Now, lab-grown diamonds have found acceptance in the US, Dubai, Australia and Germany. We don’t see export graph going down anytime soon.”

According to Global Diamond Report-2019 by Bain & Company, most of lab-grown diamonds are purchased in the US, but produced in China and India. While China accounts for nearly 50% of global production of lab-grown gems, India produces 20% with focus on polished diamonds sales.

Paul Zimnisky, New York-based independent diamond industry analyst, told TOI, “I estimate that man-made diamonds produced for jewellery will be around 5 million rough carats this year, up 35% from last year. Based on my analysis, man-made diamonds are selling 45-55% less than equivalent natural diamonds.”

The rain and thundershowers are likely to continue till March 21, the IMD bulletin said.

When asked if the change in weather will have any impact on the coronavirus outbreak, state government’s spokesperson on Covid-19 Subroto Bagchi said, “The impact of rain or weather change on coronavirus is not known yet. But the only way with which people can protect themselves from the virus is by frequently washing their hands and by practising social distance or home isolation.”

Doctors are also not very sure about the impact rain will have on the spread of the deadly virus. “Since it is a new virus, not much research or study has been done on it. It is difficult to know the impact of rain on corona but change in weather may increase the number of patients suffering from cold, cough and flu. And all patients with these symptoms need to be very careful,” said Dr P N Sahu, a senior medicine specialist at AMRI Hospitals here.

“A cyclonic circulation is brewing over north coastal Odisha and its neighbourhood. Light to moderate rain or thundershowers are likely to occur at one or two places over Rayagada, Koraput, Gajapati, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj, Balasore and Kandhamal districts in the next 24 hours while dry weather is likely to prevail in rest of the districts,” the bulletin added.

Several districts of the state like Jajpur, Cuttack, Kendrapada, Mayurbhanj of north Odisha and Gajapati of South coastal Odisha witnessed light to moderate rain on Tuesday.

However, the weatherman said, there will be no major change in maximum and minimum temperature across Odisha. The temperature is below normal in the interior Odisha and above normal in coastal region. The highest maximum temperature of 36.2 degree Celsius was recorded at Sonepur and the lowest minimum temperature of 16 degree Celsius was recorded at Sundargarh, the Met office said.

He added that all those who wanted to join the saffron party are welcome.

Speaking to the media in Gandhinagar on Tuesday, Patel said, “As I hear, there will be more resignations by Congress MLAs in the coming days. We are just watching.”Patel said: “I have said earlier that there is groupism within the Congress and I reiterate that irrespective of where the Congress takes its MLAs, many of their legislators have made up their minds to quit the party.” He went on to say: “Those who are willing to go by the BJP’s ideology are welcome in the party.”

Inside the house, Patel took a dig at the Congress MLAs camping in Jaipur, saying they could get infected with coronavirus there. The Congress has moved a majority of its Gujarat MLAs to a resort in Jaipur to prevent horse-trading ahead of the election.

Patel said he will send an email to Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and request him to ensure the well-being of the Gujarat MLAs. “The Rajasthan government will be responsible if any of the Gujarat MLAs get infected by coronavirus,” stated Patel, who holds the health portfolio.

He went on to say that the home department should test all Congress MLAs for the virus on the Rajasthan-Gujarat border when they return. He sought permission from the speaker to allow the health department officials to examine them before they enter the state assembly to vote, as they could risk the health of BJP MLAs. Jitu Vaghani, the state BJP president, said the BJP will comfortably win three of the four Rajya Sabha seats. “There will be cross-voting by Congress MLAs in the Rajya Sabha election,” he said.

Nagpur: “You are a great mother as you didn’t let the virus come near your children. And you are a great wife as you are sharing your husband’s pain,” reads a letter kept on top of a mirror in Asha’s (name changed) isolation ward.Staying at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Nagpur since almost a week, Asha reads the letter written by her 14-year-old daughter few times in a day. It’s the first time that the family has been kept apart this way. “Things changed overnight for us when my husband’s test came positive,” she says.Before the family could reconcile itself to the fact that Rakesh (name changed) has been diagnosed with one of the world’s deadliest disease , Asha too was tested positive for coronavirus . “Unlike my husband, I showed no symptoms,” she says.Rakesh returned to India from USA on March 6 from a business trip with his colleagues. An IT professional, he was complaining of fever and sore throat since he came back.“Initially, we went to our family physician. My husband started feeling better but around March 9, he was feverish again. With the news of coronavirus getting viral, our doctor advised us to get him tested,” recalls Asha.Rakesh went to Mayo hospital for the tests. The same night, his results were out. “The next morning, my in-laws, two kids and I were taken for tests. Except for me, all tested negative,” says Asha.Though Asha had taken conscious efforts to make certain that the children don’t enter their room when Rakesh was sick, she being an altruist wife could not keep the virus away.Rakesh, who is “guilty of passing on the disease” to his wife, is kept in an isolation ward at Mayo Hospital. His two colleagues who accompanied him to USA and have also been tested positive are with Asha in the same hospital. “I would say Rakesh is mentally stronger than me. After all, he is alone there,” she says.‘Corona Pyaar Hai’ (a WhatsApp group) is what is keeping all four of them connected to combat loneliness. “We keep sending motivational messages to each other and keep constant touch. During this adversity, we are trying everything possible to find our source of happiness,” says Asha.A trainer of Montessori teachers, she spends a lot of her time ideating new teaching concepts. “The best part amid all this is the cooperation I am getting from the hospital staff. They are taking care of all my requirements — be it a table, a pair of scissors glue or anything else,” she adds.While battling the disease, the mother of two is finding solace not just in solitude but also spirituality. “Reading Gita is helping me retain my sangfroid. I have come to believe that when human limits end, God’s begin,” she says.Not once during the 21-minute-long phone call with TOI did she sound downhearted. The only overpowering emotion that came across was gratitude — for proactive doctors, her strong kids, concerned relatives and friends and the sweepers who “take a big risk but come every day to clean her ward”.Asha is pragmatic enough not to let the social stigma attached with the disease affect her. “If I was on the other side of the world, I would have probably behaved the same way. The fear is natural. It took me time to accept this. Had you called me yesterday, I would have not been in a condition to speak with you,” she tells TOI.Asha wants everyone to pray for her and the family. “I know we are going to come out of this very soon. And when that happens, I will personally thank everyone who stood by us. After all, it’s during the worst storms of your life that you get to know who stand with you,” Asha hangs up with a “see you soon”.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74680609,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-77993,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/being-alone-my-husband-is-stronger-than-i-am/articleshow/74680610.cms

There was no specific complaint against him, but we had information that he may get involved in some criminal activity. Thus, he was arrested as a preventive measure,” said C K Patel.

Police sources said Modi was involved in gambling activity and this is why he was arrested.

On March 11, 30-year-old Vimal Yadav, a worker, had also died under mysterious circumstances in the lock-up of Pandesara police station. His family alleged that police did not shift him to hospital despite he feeling breathlessness in the lock-up. Inquiry into his death is being done by assistant commissioner of police, F division.

The government identified them as notifiable diseases under the Goa, Daman and Diu Public Health Act, 1985.

Last week, the government invoked the Epidemic Act, 1897, to better combat the Covid-19. A health official said that not all private practitioners notify cases treated by them, and so, it does not give them a correct picture of diseases.

While the bench of Justice Sonia Gokani and Justice Gita Gopi sought a reply on Patel’s allegations, the state government assured that it would not initiate any action against Patel till next hearing, which is on March 20. Patel was seeking protection at least till the RS polls. Last week, a bench headed by Justice J B Pardiwala recused itself from hearing the matter. In his petition, Patel claimed that his voting rights might be taken away ahead of the RS polls. He said that a local BJP leader Mukesh Thakkar recently filed a complaint before the Banaskantha district collector claiming that Patel had suppressed “many things” while filing his affidavits for the 2017 assembly elections. Patel’s disqualification is sought by Thakkar under section 125 of the Representation of People Act.

Picture of Jinnah removed, black paint erased to show the BR Ambedkar Marg inscription again

Ambedkar’s name blacked out from the signboard and a picture of Muhammad Ali Jinnah pasted on it

NEW DELHI: Controversy never seems to leave Jawaharlal Nehru University alone. While students and university authorities are wrangling over the closure of hostels after suspension of classes due to the threat of the novel coronavirus, there is also an anachronistic war under way over signboards.After a lane was named after Hindutva stalwart V D Savarkar , the signboard was vandalised and the name of B R Ambedkar inscribed over it on Monday night. But early on Tuesday, even that was the target of defacers, who blacked out the name and pasted a picture of Mohammad Ali Jinnah at the side.The signboard was cleaned on Tuesday evening by the RSS-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad , though the name of Ambedkar remained. The student organisation alleged that Jinnah’s picture was the handiwork of Left student groups, but said it didn’t know who had replaced Savarkar’s name with Ambedkar’s.“The JNU administration took the decision last year to name the various roads on the campus. Therefore, the road near Subansir Hostel was named after Savarkar ,” said ABVP JNU president Shivam Chaurasia. “However, the leftist students took midnight action to deface the road sign with the Mohammad Ali Jinnah poster.”While condemning the act, Chaurasia also alluded to the left students painting graffiti on the walls of the administration block last year during the agitation against the hostel fee hike. Chaurasia, however, had no clue to who had inscribed the name of Ambedkar on the signboard.It was JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh who, in a tweet at 1.11am on Tuesday, posted the image of the defaced signboard bearing Ambedkar’s name. Alongside she wrote, “We can never ever accept apologists and stooges of the British who undermined our secular fabric. Let’s respect those who gave us our Constitution.”JNUSU itself denied involvement in the issue but declared, “JNU believes in the ideals of Bhagat Singh and Ambedkar, not Savarkar or Jinnah as ABVP does” and charged the saffron student organisation with “crossing all levels of shamelessness” and “maligning JNU by circulating morphed images of the road in the name of Jinnah”.JNU Teachers’ Federation, breakaway faction of JNU Teachers’ Association, condemned the vandalism and accused the miscreants of trying to “vitiate the peaceful environment” and called for the immediate identification and punishment.JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar explained that the naming of different roads on the campus had been approved by the Executive Council based on the recommendations of the campus development committee in 2016. “In the past two years, several roads have been named after great personalities,” Kumar said. “Last night some miscreants indulged in defacing the road signage. This is highly regrettable. In an educational institution, one can disagree intellectually but stooping to such acts is unwarranted.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74683712,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-262369,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/savarkar-to-jinnah-signs-of-fresh-row-at-jnu/articleshow/74681624.cms

However, the health department has not issued any directives in this regard yet.Similarly, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said on Tuesday that private hospitals can treat Covid-19 positive patients in their isolation wards. However, no private hospital in the city has isolation ward that meets the required criteria for Covid-19 treatment. This means suspects and patients in Vidarbha willing to undergo tests and treatment in private hospitals will have to rely only on government set-up at least for a considerable period.At present, only government labs are permitted to conduct Covid-19 tests and positive patients are treated in isolation wards of the government hospitals only.Central guidelines allow testing only for symptomatic individuals with travel history to affected countries. There are many who are symptomatic, but do not fit the current criteria. Central government has said that all such persons who wish to undergo tests can do so in private labs. But the city has only one such lab ready for conducting the tests after getting a go ahead from health department.“Several labs in Nagpur have NABL-accreditation, but this is not enough to conduct Covid-19 tests,” said Dr Madhavi Deshmukh, vice-president of Vidarbha Association of Medical Microbiologists (VAMM). “Labs must have necessary equipment, ambience, isolation facilities, technicians trained in National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, and the testing agent which is to be provided by government agencies,” she said.Presently, Dhruv Pathology and Molecular Diagnostic Lab is the only one in Nagpur where the tests can be started immediately.“We have trained technicians, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines with open platform. We use same ABS system which is used in Indira Gandhi Government Medical College & Hospital (IGGMCH). I have personally informed health department that our lab is fully equipped and willing to conduct these tests. Authorities have asked us to wait as the state is yet to release permissions for private labs,” said Dr Shailendra Mundhada , managing director of Dhruv Lab.Dr Sandeep Yadav, president of Maharashtra Association of Practising Pathologists and Microbiologists, said there are only a few such labs in the state. “As there are only some labs that fit into the government criteria at present, instead of allowing private labs, government should rather focus on strengthening lab facilities at GMCHs,” he said.Private hospitals not ready: VHAMany Covid-19 patients may be willing to get treatment in private hospitals, but no corporate hospital in Nagpur is designed for it, said Dr Anup Marar, secretary of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA).“We can’t provide separate isolation, separate air conditioning and oxygenation to Covid-19 patients. Instead, we have suggested government to take over one full hospital with less occupancy. Other hospitals will provide necessary infrastructure and trained staff, if necessary. We can’t admit these patients in our existing set-ups,” he said.During swine flu outbreak, many private hospitals experienced that patients admitted to other wards left as soon as they came to know about serious patients being treated in the same building. Because of this, not many private hospitals will come forward to treat Covid-19 patients.Govt Is Only HopeCentre has permitted private labs to conduct Covid-19 testsThe test, which is conducted free in govt labs, may cost up to Rs9,000 in pvt set-upState health minister has permitted pvt hospitals to treat Covid-19 positive patientsBut, not many private labs or hospitals in Nagpur fulfil required criteriaLabs may have NABL accreditation, but don’t have PCR machines, separate premises etcCorporate hospitals don’t have separate entrance, isolation wards, separate oxygenation, air conditioning and trained staff to treat such patients",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74680617,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-158801,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-19-test-treatment-in-city-pvt-set-up-still-a-distant-dream/articleshow/74680618.cms

305,['18/03/2020'],Social distancing does not mean social boycott,"Nagpur: After four persons tested positive for coronavirus , their families are being ostracized, not only by the society, but also by their friends and relatives.Even those working with the patients’ families as maids and guards are now facing the heat. They, too, are being boycotted. Some of them have even lost their jobs because they were employed at the homes of patients Expressing concern, social workers have urged citizens to support the families of patients and not to ostracize them.Warning those who have distanced themselves from the affected families due to the fear that they might contract the disease, social workers said it’s time to stand united, with precautions.Leading by example, mayor Sandip Joshi , accompanied by wife Devyani paid a visit to one of the affected families and assured them of all the support possible. Both husband and wife from this family tested positive and have been put up at different hospitals. Their teenaged children are at home, close to their grandparents who reside in an adjacent house. The city’s first couple also plans to visit families of the other two patients in next couple of days.“I decided to visit their place after coming across disturbing reports regarding ostracization of their kin. People must understand that the patients and their relatives are not criminals or leprosy patients. They are just normal human beings who have been infected. In all likelihood, they will be cured soon. One does needs to take care while meeting them, but boycotting them is criminal,” Joshi told TOI.He pointed out that even the maid, employed with the patient couple’s family, was thrown out of her home by her landlord and another one was asked to discontinue work by neighbours.“Civic workers are not collecting garbage from their house. People should stand by such families and encourage them to fight the menace. My purpose of visiting them was to give them support and encouragement and to convey the message that we are solidly behind them,” said Joshi.An employee of an IT firm, whose three employees tested positive, said that he, too, faced a similar problem after he uploaded his videos on social media. “After I came in contact with three of my colleagues, I decided to self quarantine myself at home. I uploaded my videos for a noble cause to create awareness, but people took them in the negative sense. They thought that I had contracted the virus. I was forced to upload a new video to dispel doubts. I clarified that I’m just taking precautionary measures,” he said.Social workers like Smita Singalkar felt that people shouldn’t distance themselves from patients or their families and should be kind to them.“People should take steps like wearing masks before meeting patients or their families, but boycotting them won’t serve the purpose. The government should also ensure that masks and sanitizers are made available in sufficient quantity,” she said.Even patients, who talked to TOI over phone, said they were concerned about their families, especially after their names were disclosed through social media. “I experienced this feeling when people started distancing themselves at home and in hospital despite the fact that I’m in good condition. Even our families are suffering,” a patient told TOI.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/social-distancing-does-not-mean-social-boycott/articleshow/74680626.cms

Shyamu Mishra, a resident of Udhna, was convicted by a court for rape under sections of Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSCO). He was sentenced to 10 years in jail.

Mishra pulled the minor to his room when she was coming out of a common bathroom in the house on August 13. In her complaint the minor alleged that she was harassed by the convict in the past as well after which her father had sent her away to Mumbai at a relative's place. The survivor returned to the city after she fell ill.

Scientific and medical evidences collected by police proved the charges. Police had recovered clothes of the convict and the minor from which samples for forensic examination were collected.

308,['18/03/2020'],"Masks in place, colours of faith fly high at Zambaulim","MARGAO: Notwithstanding the restrictions on mass gatherings in view of the coronavirus scare, Madgaonkars kept their tryst with their patron deity Lord Damodar, or Dambab, as the deity is reverentially known, as they flocked to Zambaulim to celebrate the annual ‘gulal’.

It’s their ardent belief that Dambab plays gulal with the Madgaonkars on this auspicious day. However, a large number of revellers were seen masks in a bid to ward off the threat of the virus as advised by the Ramnath Damodar Devasthan committee.

As the ‘Zambaulecho Gulal’ got underway, it was a riot of colours. Shouts of ‘Shree Ramnath Damodar Maharaj ki Jai!’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’ rant the air as devotees flung fistfuls of gulal at the ‘palakhi’ carrying the idol of Lord Damodar stationed in the courtyard of Shree Ramnath Devasthan.

History has it that the original temple of Lord Damodar was located in the area known as ‘Madd’ in Margao, which is now referred to as ‘Lingakadden’ and where the ancient temple tank still stands. During the early conquests by the Portuguese in the 16th century, locals attempted to shift the Shivling to a safer place, but only managed to sever a part of it which they shifted to Zambaulim where the current temple of Shree Damodar stands.

It’s in honour of Shree Ramnath and with a sense of gratitude to Him for offering his place for Lord Damodar that Dambab’s palakhi is brought to the temple of Shree Ramnath, on the night preceding the Gulal.

The week-long Shishirotsav at Zambaulim began with the arrival of the traditional nal’l (holy coconut) from the house of late Purushottam Keni in Comba , Margao, to Damodar temple, Zambaulim, in a grand procession, on Thursday.

‘Dhulpeth’ is celebrated the day after Gulal, which is famous for the sumptuous meals served to the devotees that day. The shigmotsav culminates with the immersion of the nal’l into the river on the conclusion of Dhulpeth.

309,['18/03/2020'],Testing times as MCH facility works non-stop,"Thiruvananthapuram: A small team led by the Government Medical College Hospital’s department of microbiology has been working round the clock to test the large inflow of samples with primary and secondary contact numbers rising in the district. The facility, which opened on March 11, tested over 100 samples in the first five days. By Sunday, the team had completed testing of 135 samples.

With the administration opening new collection centres in the district, samples from these centres are being added to those from the corona clinic at MCH. Samples from private hospitals in the city are also being tested at the facility.

The team is now equipped with confirmatory kits to deliver faster results; which means that the samples tested positive at the MCH lab need no longer be sent to the NIV facility in Alappuzha for confirmation. This is proving crucial especially as time is of the essence in preventing spread of the infection.

The team, comprising research assistants, molecular biology scientists, technicians led by head of microbiology, are not even following specified duty hours simply due to sheer number of samples being handled.

The technology used for detecting the virus is called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and tests are done using real-time PCR thermal cyclers/thermocyclers.

On the opening day the team tested three samples, which soon jumped to 20-40 samples a day.

What was initially a two-member team soon inducted two molecular scientists from the pathology department as sample numbers increased with each passing day.

The first 10 samples and test results were sent to NIV Pune, which validated the test results and quality-control measures. This was a shot in the arm for the team.

While a PCR machine can load 20 samples at a time, preparation takes 5 hours with loading taking 1.5 hours. It takes nearly 6.5 hours to get the result. The team then carries out a reconfirmation test which takes same amount of time.

The team members wear personal protection kits while loading samples.

All precautions taken by a doctor during treatment or collection of the swab specimen of an infected patient are followed in the lab as well.

The team, which is already working overtime, knows that they are in for more challenging days ahead as more primary contacts are tracked down and samples are collected from latest cases.

Eighteen of the cancelled trains are from Nagpur and some passing through the city.

The railways also decided to increase platform ticket price fourfold from the present Rs10 to Rs50 to prevent overcrowding at six major stations. The new rates have been made applicable with immediate effect at Nagpur, Chandrapur, Ballarshah, Wardha, Betul and Sewagram stations.

“On an average, 5,200 platform tickets are sold at Nagpur. The decision has been taken to avoid crowding at the station,” said assistant commercial manager (ACM) SG Rao.

Sources, however, said that the number of visitors on platforms could be even more.

“At times, more people come to see off passengers than the actual number of travellers. We need to avoid crowding to keep coronavirus at bay,” said railway officials.

However, passengers need not panic over cancellation of trains towards Mumbai, Pune and Howrah. The 18 trains that have been cancelled between March 18 to 31 have low occupancy. Some trains operate weekly and twice a week.

Regular mail/express trains like Pune-Nagpur, Garib Rath, Gondia-CSMT Vidarbha, Sewagram, Maharashtra have not been cancelled. Barring Nandigram Express, the other trains that have been cancelled are weekly or bi-weekly trains.

The trains that have been cancelled include 11201-11202 LTT-Ajni-LTT, 22135/22136 Nagpur-Rewa-Nagpur, 11401-11402 Nagpur-CSMT-Nagpur Nandigram, 11417-11418 Nagpur-Pune-Nagpur, 22139-22140 Ajni-Pune-Ajni, 22111-22112 Bhusawal-Nagpur-Bhusawal & 12261-12262 CSMT-Howrah-CSMT Duronto. Six weekly special trains between Nagpur-Solapur-Nagpur (02111-02112 & 02113-02114) have also been cancelled.

Railway officials said occupancy of the trains that have been cancelled will be adjusted in regular trains to Pune, where otherwise the number of travellers has gone down.

Bharatiya Yatri Kendra (BYK) general secretary Basant Shukla has welcomed the decision to hike platform ticket rates. “Officials should keep all the exit and entry gates open so that crowding is minimised. Also, the number of reservation counters should be increased,” Shukla said.

In the last 15 days from March 1 to 14, the Nagpur division of Central Railway has refunded over Rs5.25 crore towards cancellation of tickets by 82,725 passengers. Most of these passengers had plans to travel towards Pune and Mumbai.

AMRITSAR: Ten Indian passengers, who have been kept in a makeshift quarantine centre in Amritsar upon arrival from Spain via Doha on Sunday midnight, have complained of poor hygiene and illtreatment by staff.

Out of the 11 travellers, one had cough and fever, and which he was shifted to the isolation ward of Guru Nanak Dev Hospital on Monday morning. After the passengers and their relatives went to the press over hygiene at the centre, the civil surgeon’s office released pictures of bathrooms to show hygiene maintained by them.

The passengers had arrived by Qatar Airways, from Doha to Amritsar, on Sunday past midnight. All of them had originated from Spain. As they landed at Amritsar’s Sri Guru Ram Das International Airport, they were frisked to the quarantine centre set up at Swami Vivekanand De-addiction & Rehabilitation Centre.

The passengers talked to journalists from across the iron gate of the centre and complained that beds were soiled, bathrooms were dirty and they were maltreated by staff. Outside the centre, their relatives threatened to block the road if they were not allowed to go since they claimed that none of them had the symptoms of coronavirus.

The administration had erected the quarantine facility for incoming travellers, including Indians, from seven countries — China, Italy, Iran, Korea, France, Spain and Germany — for 15 days.

A medical officer who didn’t wish to give his name said they would examine the patients on Tuesday and decide on whether to keep them for rest of 14 days or allow them to go. He said a person had been admitted on March 4 and was tested positive for Covid-19. He said the man was stable, while two of his relatives, who were tested negative, were still in the isolation ward along with one of the 11 passengers who had arrived on Sunday past midnight.

Amritsar deputy commissioner Shivdular Singh Dhillon said people should cooperate with the administration to check the virus’s spread as it was for everyone’s benefit. On the allegations of misbehaviour, he said, according to his reports, passengers also misbehaved with staff and kept them awake all night.

313,['18/03/2020'],Hyderabad: Locals to rope in priests to curb plastic in puja items,"Water was drained out recently from Kapra Lake for desiltation

SECUNDERABAD: Residents of Sainikpuri have decided to rope in the Brahmin and Pujari communities along with resident welfare associations to urge people to avoid plastic items in ‘puja samagri’ and prevent plastic pollution at Kapra Lake.

The Kapra Lake is undergoing major overhaul what with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) desilting the lake and developing walking tracks. While the GHMC is doing its bit of connecting storm water drains and diversion of polluted water to a channel, residents have come forward to educate the people, temple committees and Brahmin and Pujari communities in the vicinity on zero waste.

Every year, over 4,000 idols are immersed at the lake, spread over an expansive 113 acres. The immersion pond is only used during the festive season with people disposing the puja items inside the lake throughout the year.

“We have identified five temples in the neighbouring colonies, members of which will be educated on the zero waste initiative. We will be inviting both pujaris as well as temple committee members,” said Chandrasekhar, secretary of Federation of North-Eastern Colonies of Secunderabad.

While the first meeting with all the stakeholders was planned on Sunday, it was subsequently postponed owing to the state government’s restrictions on public meetings. “We have postponed our proposed meeting with Brahmin & Pujari Sanghams in view of the present situation. The state government had imposed ban on public meetings and seminars till March 31 as precautionary measures to curtail further spread of coronavirus,” tweeted Green Sainikpuri, the official handle representing Sainikpuri residents, who now plan to hold the meeting in the first week of April.

The residents are also planning to install a bin near the immersion pond that can be used to dump puja waste instead of disposing it in the lake. Residents plan to have vermicompost pits in every temple in the neighbouring colonies near Kapra Lake.

On a pilot basis, residents of Sai Baba Officers colony (SBO colony) have started converting garden waste leaves and kitchen waste into vermicompost. The residents intend to extend the model to other colonies too. “In SBO colony, we are using few open plots for cultivation of vegetables and nursery. We collect saplings from residents and multiply them,” said Chandrasekhar.

314,['18/03/2020'],Over 90% buildings face threat of triple property tax,"Nagpur: Over 90% buildings in the city are facing the threat of paying triple property tax if plans of municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe materialize. Mundhe announced that the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will levy triple property tax on buildings lacking occupancy certificate (OC).

He presented the NMC’s budget before the standing committee on Monday. A standing committee member told TOI that Mundhe made an announcement in this regard in his budget speech.

On Tuesday, Mundhe said, “OC is mandatory as per building rules. There is a provision in the rules to recover two times more property tax for violation of building bylaws. Therefore, it is expected from all owners of buildings and builders to obtain OC so that they are not penalized. NMC will give them a chance to obtain OC and then start penalizing,” he said.

OC is mandatory for every building since introduction of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, 1966. The state government had made it mandatory for all urban local bodies to recover triple property tax on unauthorized constructions since the last eight years.

NMC had levied penalty property tax only on a very few buildings. There are over 3,000 buildings which were served notices under the MRTP Act. But, the civic body did not levy penalty on all such buildings.

Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe said, “Mundhe’s decision is not justified. Over 95% buildings do not have OC. It is the mistake of NMC and NIT for not implementing rules effectively all these years. Also, a building cannot be termed as unauthorized if it lacks OC. The number of individual buildings is high, so many will suffer. Instead, NMC should hold special camps, regularize unauthorized structures in compounding scheme and then compel for OC,” he said.

BJP corporator Virendra Kukreja said, “I came to know that Mundhe announced it in his budget but it will be an anti-public move. There are many buildings which can’t get sanction due to hassles in ownership titles. It should be implemented only on flat schemes and malls, that too by allowing internal changes,” he said.

Credai president Mahesh Sadhwani said NMC should not implement it with retrospective effect. “I also feel that all buildings should have OC. Therefore, NMC should implement it on buildings which will be given sanction from now onwards. It will consume a lot time and also need many documents for getting OC for existing buildings,” he said.

Rules and lack of implementation

OC is mandatory for all buildings since introduction of MRTP Act, 1966

Over 90% buildings do not have OC in city due to ineffective implementation of rules by NMC and NIT for all these years

State government made it mandatory for urban local bodies to recover triple property tax from unauthorized constructions in 2012

It means property tax will become Rs3,000 if existing tax is Rs1,000 till demolition or regularization of unauthorized construction

NMC levied it only on a very few unauthorized buildings

It did not even levy it on buildings which were served notices under MRTP Act

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe has announced that NMC will start levying triple property tax on buildings lacking OC

Mundhe said a chance will be given for obtaining OC first

COIMBATORE: Many offices in the city are in the process of going into lockdown mode. Many of them are arranging laptops for employees, who are asked to get WiFi connections to start working from home. Many foundries in the city that don’t offer the work from home option are trying to improve sanitation and ventilation at their places.

Fearing a sudden government instruction to remain closed for a specific period, many offices had on Monday begun the process of making their employees work from home. Prominent electric and home appliances firm Bosch on Monday instructed all their employees in the city to work from home from Tuesday to Friday, when they would be issued fresh instructions.

Ashish P (name changed), an employee, said, “The company is taking the next four days like a trial to see how work from home will suit the firm, so that it is prepared if the government asks it to shut down.”

The human resources and information technology staff of an IT company in Saravanampatti is frantically in the process of hiring laptops for employees, who do not have one, and loading their work software on to them and arranging server access. “We want to be ready with infrastructure for our 3000-odd staff to work from home by Wednesday if the government orders it,” the HR said.

Manufacturing companies, which cannot give their employees a work from home option, are a worried lot. “We have been taking some measures like keeping windows open, placing sanitizers at the entry and exit of every unit and asking our employees to wash their hands every few hours,” said Santhosh H, a factory manager of a foundry in Chinna Vedampatti . “We are also trying to ensure no crowding of employees in any spot while working.”

The fitness freaks in the city, who regularly workout from gyms, were disappointed when the state government ordered all gyms to be closed. Though gym operators have promised home workout videos and workout plans that could be done at home, people are disappointed. “Not all of us have the right flooring or equipment like timers. They have now banned outdoor gyms too. Now, we have no option but to simply run or walk,” said Shireen B, a postpartum mother on a weight loss diet.

BHOPAL: Amid political crisis in Madhya Pradesh, tight security arrangements have been made at the hotels where BJP MLAs have been lodged for the last two days.

About 106 MLAs, who aborted their plan to fly to a private hotel in Manesar of Gurugram, were shifted to two private resorts in Sehore, 40 km from the state capital, to keep the MLAs away from the Congress leaders.

Former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also reached the resort on Monday evening and stayed for the night before leaving for Governor's house on Tuesday morning. Chouhan accompanied by BJP state chief VD Sharma, discussed current political situation with the MLAs and also warned the government officials to desist from putting undue pressure on the MLAs through their family members.

“We are getting information that some officials are pressurizing the family members of BJP MLAs and putting undue pressure on them to be cowed into submission. We are preparing a list of such officials who are trying to target the MLAs. We have warned those officials the nobody will be spared if they try to interfere in political affairs,"" said Chouhan.

Amid tight security, the personnel appointed at the resort were not allowing anybody to enter. On Tuesday, former minister and MLA from Ichchawar, Karan Singh Verma was waylaid by the security at the entry of the resort. Later, the police identified him and allowed his in.

""I had gone to my village Jamunia. When I returned, there was some confusion. Some security personnel were not willing to let me in. But, tight security is good. Noting happened and I was allowed in later,"" Verma told reporters after the incident.

After Chouhan, BJP leaders including Narottam Mishra , Gopal Bhargava and VD Sharma also met the MLAs. The party has booked 50 rooms in the hotel after 100 MLAs who were destined to leave for New Delhi on Monday evening were shifted to Sehore amid Governor's directives to conduct floor test in the House on March 17.

320,['18/03/2020'],"Cane crushing dips, 1/3 mills stop manufacturing","KOLHAPUR: Sugarcane crunch in the district has seriously affected the crushing activity with more than one third sugar mills have stopped manufacturing of sugar.

Just four months into the cane crushing season as 56 out of 146 sugar mills have stopped crushing cane.

Sources in the sugar commissionerate office said that cane crushing has drastically come down in the current season as compared to the last two years. Mills, which have obtained crushing license this season, have crushed just five crore tonne cane so far by manufacturing 5.58 lakh quintals of sugar.

According to industry sources, the cane availability has been a serious issue in Solapur and Ahmednagar districts. Even though both districts had 16 and 12 factories each, none went into cane crushing this season bringing down the sugar production. The majority of these factories did not start crushing because of financial difficulties or lack of cane availability.

It is no surprise that western Maharashtra received extended rains while the Marathwada region had a drought-like situation. Both conditions drastically affected sugar can development in the region.

As many as 195 sugar factories were involved in crushing last year while the number has come down to just 146 in the current season. They said that 45 sugar mills, which included private and cooperative, were not involved in the cane crushing, which resulted in a fall in sugar production across Maharashtra.

Till last year, sugar mills have crushed 9.50 crore tonne of cane as compared to a mere five crore tonne this year. Sugar mill operators feel that crushing season, which normally continues till May end, is expected to get over in April this year. They pointed out that cane availability in sugar-rich western Maharashtra is at a gradual decline for the past few years.

321,['18/03/2020'],Dwindling powers see ZPs used as gateway to assembly,"Margao: Ever since they were set up as the second tier of the panchayati raj institution in 2000, zilla panchayats in Goa have been fighting a losing battle over devolution of funds , powers and functions by the state government. But when it comes to elections to these district-level bodies , which have otherwise almost been reduced to non-entities, the euphoria it generates on the political landscape is at once electric and infectious.

While there are differing views among proponents of ‘self-governance’ over the need for the second-tier panchayat body in a small state like Goa, experts in the field of panchayati raj say the government has used the ‘powerlessness’ of the ZPs as leverage to wield greater power for itself.

They say that ideally, the gram panchayats and ZPs should have been linked by ensuring that projects and proposals of the gram panchayats are routed through ZPs. In the absence of interlinking, the gram panchayats and ZPs effectively become subservient to the MLAs and MPs when it comes to seeking funds and approvals for development works.

“The current system defeats the very idea of self-governing bodies. If funds for village projects had been routed through the ZPs instead of MLAs and MPs, it would have ensured accountability and transparency,” a senior bureaucrat said.

Ironically, ZP membership is seen by many contestants as the gateway to the portals of power in the legislative assembly.

Panchayati raj researcher, Tanaji Halarnkar , however, says, “There are many contestants who still believe in local self-governing bodies as agencies of rural development. However, for those who seek to gain political mileage, it may not be an easy task anymore, as money and muscle power have dominated power politics.”

With the ZP elections now being conducted along party lines, they serve dual purposes for political parties. “While it helps parties reach out to rural voters and wield sway over them,” Halarnkar says, “It also helps them assess their strength in the rural heartland ahead of the assembly elections. Also, every MLA takes keen interest in ZP elections to strengthen his hold over his constituency, and to fortify his position in his party.”

Nevertheless, holding of ZP polls on party lines hasn’t gone down well with panchayati raj proponents. “The basic philosophy of panchayati raj does not permit open participation of political parties. The open entry to parties will prove disastrous to these people’s republics,” Halarnkar said.

Acting on a tip off, officers of DGGI Nagpur unit carried out search operations at the offices of M/s Wazalwar Driving School Pvt Ltd at Shivaji Nagar (proprietor Manish Wazalwar and Rachana Wazalwar), M/s Desai Driving School at Plot No.1, Main Road, Jiwan Akshay Society , Manish Nagar (proprietor Usha Manohar Desai), and M/s Shree Driving School at Block No. 5, Gadge Maharaj Dharamshala , Medical Chowk, Nagpur (proprietor Dilip A Chitre).

During investigations, it was observed that these entities were engaged in providing motor driving lessons, which are taxable services, for over 20 years but they had not taken registration or continued registration with the department either under service tax or under GST.

It was also observed that a very small number of the receipts were being accounted for by these entities in the statutory records like income tax returns and other financial documents, whereas the bulk of the receipts were taken in cash from trainees in order to systematically evade payment of both service tax and GST.

On preliminary inquiries, including analysis of the ‘kaccha’ receipts and registers recovered and seized during the search operations, it has been estimated that taxable value of over Rs10 crore has been suppressed by these entities in just the last five years involving service tax, and GST of approximately Rs1.86 crore. The department has also recorded statements of the proprietors and seized documents for scrutiny.

326,['18/03/2020'],"Hyderabad: Registration rush crashes RTA server, halts services","Heavy rush for registration of BS-IV vehicles at Trimulgherry RTA office

HYDERABAD: The online services of the state transport department came to a halt on Monday due to server problems, preventing the applicants from booking their slots on the website.

Applicants complained that the department is sending the entire functioning of the online system into chaos by restricting them from accessing certain services on the website.

Satish Naik, a resident of Banjara Hills, said, “I have been trying to book a slot for learner’s license on the website the entire day and I am directed to a page that says, ‘Access is denied’. What is the use of having an online registration system to book slots if they don’t give us access to it?”

Another applicant Ashish Kumar said, “I wanted to book a slot for my license renewal but I’m just not able to do that despite trying for several hours. They transport department should at least notify the public about this before deciding to stop allowing the public from booking slots.”

“We do not even know for how long this will continue. In case the traffic police levies a penalty on my vehicle for not renewing the driver’s license on time, will the transport department compensate for my loss?”

Meanwhile, sources close to the department informed that that is being done by RTA officials to tackle the rush for registration of BS-IV vehicles.

“The RTA offices across the state are seeing a spurt in vehicle registrations as the deadline for the sales of BS-IV vehicles are round the corner. The applicants who are waiting to renew their driver’s license, book slots for learning license tests and other services are now suffering because neither the applicants nor the traffic police department was informed about this beforehand,” a source told TOI.

As per the Supreme Court directive, new vehicles that have BS-IV engines cannot be registered after March 31.

During a recent inspection at RTA office, Khairatabad, transport commissioner MRM Rao urged motorists to finish the registration process before the deadline.

Reiterating the SC directive, Rao said even if the vehicle is purchased a few days before March 31, vehicles with BS-IV engines cannot be registered after March 31. He asked the motorists not to wait till the last day and get the registration done early.

When contacted, C Ramesh, joint transport commissioner (IT) said, “We had to discontinue certain services as we are experiencing a heavy rush. This will continue for a few days.”

SALEM: A 35-year-old medical student, who went missing on Sunday, was found dead in the Vellakkalparai area here on Tuesday evening.

The Steel Plant police identified the deceased as Gourav Begara , 35, of West Bengal. He was a third-year MS ortho student of a private medical college in Ariyanur.

According to a police officer, Gourav, along with five of his friends, had went on a trekking to Kanjamalai, a hillock near their college, on Sunday morning. “They come down from the hillock around 12 noon. Gaurav, who was very tired, asked his friends to fetch him some water. They made him sit on a boulder and returned in few minutes. However, Gourav was not to be seen anywhere there,” the officer said quoting the complainants.

As their search for him didn’t yield any fruit, the five on Monday lodged a complaint with the Steel Plant police, who recovered Gaurav’s body at Vellakkalparai area and sent that to the government hospital for postmortem.

“We are yet to ascertain whether it’s a case of mudar or natural death. We are waiting for the postmortem report to confirm the same,” the official said. tnn

330,['18/03/2020'],Diamond industry turns down shutdown proposal,"Surat: Diamond industry stakeholders have unanimously decided against shutdown of the industry despite outbreak of coronavirus hitting exports of polished diamonds in the wider interests of unit owners and workers’ community.

Surat Diamond Association (SDA) and Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) had jointly organized a meeting of industry stakeholders here on Tuesday, where the proposal of shutdown was rejected. Industry stakeholders suggested taking safety precautions in diamond units, including placing hand sanitizers, distributing face masks and screening of diamond workers and unit owners.

They decided the diamond markets at Varachha and Mahidhapura will operate from 11am to 6pm. Unit owners wanting to shut their units will have to take prior approval of SDA.

SDA president Babu Kathiriya said, “SDA will be running awareness campaign in the industry on health safety measures to deal with coronavirus outbreak. Pamphlets will be distributed in the diamond hub for creating awareness. We are in constant touch with the state government and local civic body.”

Exports of polished diamonds could decrease by over 25% during the end of the financial year due to trade disruptions caused by coronavirus, especially in China market, the United States, Europe and UAE among others. Exports of polished diamonds to Hong Kong between April-January 2020 have declined by 24% at $5.7 billion against $7.6 billion during the same period in previous year.

GJEPC regional chairman Dinesh Navadia told TOI, “The industry employs about 5.5 lakh diamond workers and closure would mean rendering them jobless for 15 days. At present, the industry is operating at less than 40% capacity due to decline in export orders following coronavirus outbreak. Still, the unit owners are running the factories to keep their workers employed.”

COIMBATORE: From Wednesday midnight , all asymptomatic passengers landing in the city from 10 countries affected by Covid-19, will be quarantined for 14 days at one of the hostel buildings of Tejaa Shakthi Institute of Technology for Women at Karumathampatti .

Though the building is being equipped with 50 beds, it has provision to accommodate 200 beds, a health department official told TOI.

There was brief commotion in front of the facility on Tuesday evening when Coimbatore collector K Rajamani arrived to inspect it. Staging a protest against setting up the quarantine centre there, as many as 100 residents of the area blocked the collector’s vehicle. The collector got off the vehicle and explained that only asymptomatic patients will be quarantined there.

The district administration began identifying a space to quarantine Covid-19 patients two days after the Indian government made quarantine compulsory for passengers landing from the United Arab Emirates , Qatar, China, Oman, South Korea , Iran, Italy, Spain, Germany and France. “While patients with symptoms will be taken to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for treatment, testing for the virus and then isolation, the patients without symptoms will be housed in this building for 14 days,” deputy director of the public health department Dr Ramesh said.

Since it is a quarantine space for asymptomatic patients who require no treatment and only monitoring, officials said the hostel has all the basic facilities to make quarantine simple. “It already has beds, laundry facilities, adequate number of toilets and canteen facilities. The revenue department is yet to take a decision on extra facilities like books, television and Wi-Fi,” said Ramesh, who supervised cleaning of the building on Tuesday.

The move to set up set up pure quarantine facilities outside government hospitals seems to have been fuelled by reports of people not reporting symptoms and travel history, and even fleeing airports fearing quarantine in government hospitals, sources said.

Each cabin has an attached toilet. Though the nursing station is common, the facility has separate sets of portable equipment,like ventilators and ECG machines.

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is going to impose stringent conditions on the agencies taking up these works and ensuring that the roads are restored immediately.

In the past, the agencies had failed to restore the roads after completion of their work. The roads dug up remained in the same condition for a long time. The civic body then faces the wrath of the locals.

Harshit Ghatge, city engineer of divisional ward office number 4, said, “We have received the applications from two agencies. One agency is going to lay the optical cable network in the city. The work is given by the state government to connect the government offices. The government has sought waiver of all taxes or the charges to lay the cables for around 14km stretch.”

Ghatge said that another agency is assigned the task to lay the gas pipeline. The project has been launched by the central government to provide piped gas supply to the households. Over 30,000 connections are likely to be provided in the first phase of the work. The substations will be established outside of the city.

In the first phase, gas pipeline along 76km stretch will be laid. “The gas pipeline network will be laid for the entire city. The company has requested reduction in fees that we charge. The fees are used to restore the damaged roads. We are going to put up both the issues before general body to decide whether to charge the agencies or not,” added Ghatge.

The KMC charges Rs 4,600 as digging charges for one kilometre stretch. The gas pipeline agency was asked to pay Rs 69 crore. If the KMC charges fees, then the responsibility of restoring the roads will be of the KMC and not of the agency.

Several hospitals have issued advisories, asking patients to keep the elderly and children away unless there’s an emergency.Over the last five days, at least four hospitals have seen a 10%-25% drop in the number of patients seeking outdoor consultation. The figure could cross 30% by the end of the week, according to hospital sources.At Peerless Hospital , the OPD footfall dropped by 25% since last week. Authorities believe it could come down to 50% by this weekend. “Consultations are being deferred due to the fear. It has been quite drastic over the last few days and we expect the OPD footfall to drop further, though there has been no change in the indoor patient count,” said Peerless medical superintendent Sudipto Mitra. While the hospital receives around 400 OPD patients a day, it dropped to 300 this week.At Medica Superspecialty Hospital, too, OPD crowd has thinned by 10% despite the hospital setting up a separate enclosure for patients with cough and cold. “We are taking measures to prevent transmission and are not allowing suspects to get close to other patients. But people are wary since visiting a hospital OPD involves travel in public transport. A large number of our patients are from the neighbouring districts. Some of them are from countries like Bangladesh and Nepal. So, the OPD crowd may thin further over the next three-four weeks,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy.“The scare persists as the number of patients swells despite the safety measures put in place at our facilities. Many of my patients called me to defer appointments this week,” said Fortis Hospital pulmonologist Raja Dhar. OPD footfall at Fortis plunged to 1,700 last week from 2,200 the week before.RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) had seen a footfall drop prior to Holi. It picked up for a few days only to plunge again this week. It dipped by 8% on Monday while the hospital has seen a 75% drop in the Bangladeshi patients’ count at the OPD. “We used to receive 200 Bangladeshi patients at the OPD till last week. It came down to just 50 on Monday,” said RTIICS zonal director R Venkatesh. The hospital issued an advisory stating that the elderly and children should stay away unless there’s an emergency.Woodlands Hospital has been spacing out patients’ appointments with doctors at their outdoor clinics. This is being done to prevent crowding at the waiting arena and at the OPD. The hospital is also seeking OPD patients’ travel history and those who have been to the affected countries are being given a ‘quarantined’ appointment. “We have set up a separate room for them and are putting them through thermal screening. Doctors are examining them in this room instead of their designated chambers,” CEO Rupali Basu said.The hospital is also using its app to curb the number of OPD patients each day. “Number of appointments are being restricted through the app. This not only helps prevent a crowd and reduce chances of infection, but also brings down the waiting time for each patient,” added Basu.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74691538,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-116996,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/despite-safety-measures-opd-footfall-drops-at-private-hosps/articleshow/74681737.cms

Ironically, Hanks, who played the lead in the movie, is down with Covid-19 at present.Rosary Manna, daughter of an advocate from Kolkata, was stuck at Kuala Lumpur airport after India suddenly decided to snap all travel links with Malaysia, Philippines and Afghanistan on Tuesday. Two Indian engineers who were stuck in Dusseldorf, Germany, have somehow managed to board an Emirates flight but remain uncertain of the future. A Swiss national, who has been stuck in Kolkata for a week, finally managed to get a ticket to Zurich. But he isn’t sure when he will reach there.Rosary is among the more than 100 students in Philippines who were returning home when they were caught unawares by the directive to ban all travels from the country as well as Malaysia, the country through which they were transiting. “The schools in Manila and rest of Philippines announced a closure on Monday. We immediately booked tickets to Kolkata and reached Kuala Lumpur around 5am on Tuesday. On landing, we were told that there were no flights operating to India,” said Rosary, who has appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Mamata Banerjee to help those stranded return to the country.“Philippines also put in place travel embargo and we can’t return there. Malaysia won’t allow us to enter as we don’t have any visa.

KRISHNAGIRI: A major fire broke out in the government cattle farm at Mathigiri near Hosur here on Monday night. While the cattle are safe, about 50 acres of trees, grass and herbs were destroyed in the incident.

The farm, which is spread across 1,640 acres, is the biggest of its kind in Asia. Besides 1,000 cows, both exotic and indigenous, the farm houses goats, sheep, roosters , hens and pigs.

Pointing out that trees, herbs and grass were cultivated on 50 acres for grazing the cattle, an official said fire engulfed the area around 10.30pm on Monday. As the fire began to spread, employees at the farm alerted the fire and rescue services personnel at Sipcot who sprang into action to douse the flames. It took them three hours to bring the fire under control.

The official said the cattle were put up on the right side of Hosur-Denkanikottai state highway, which passes through the farm, while the grazing area that caught fire was on its left side. “The fire didn’t spread to the area where the cattle were put up, thanks to the road in-between. All the cattle are safe.”

Preliminary investigation revealed that someone might have thrown a live cigarette butt or matchstick into the farm.

The Mathigiri police have registered a case and initiated inquiry.

BHOPAL: Congress MLA Laxman Singh — Digvijaya’s brother — on Saturday removed the word ‘Congress’ from his Twitter handle, triggering a flutter in the party. He now describes himself as “Krishak, Vidhayak aur Gayak (farmer, MLA and singer)”.

Laxman has been with BJP in the past, even getting elected to Lok Sabha on a BJP ticket, and has been sulking over not getting a ministerial berth. But when TOI spoke to him on his edited Twitter profile, he said: “I am in Congress and will remain with Congress.”

Asked if he had changed his Twitter bio, the Chachoda MLA said, “Yes, there was something like ‘ex-member of Parliament’, which I have dropped.” When specifically asked if he had removed mention of ‘Congress’ in his Twitter-bio, he didn’t give a clear reply, and repeated: “I am in Congress and will remain in Congress”.

Scindia had also changed his Twitter profile in November 2018, dropping all references to the posts he had held in Congress and introducing himself as a “public servant and cricket lover”. It says the same even now, when he has joined BJP.

As with Scindia, Laxman Singh’s new bio sparked speculation. He was a three-time Congress MP when he quit the party and joined BJP soon after Congress’s massive defeat in the December 2003 assembly election under the leadership of Digvijaya. Laxman won the 2004 Lok Sabha poll from Rajgarh on a BJP ticket but lost the 2009 election and came back to Congress in 2013.

A three-time MLA, he is upset at not being made minister and has made statements opposite to the party line. Last month, he urged Congress to “accept CAA” and in October last year, had sat on dharna at Digvijaya’s residence with his supporters, demanding that Chachoda be made a district.

After preliminary enquiry and statements of complainants, the committee found out that one case was fit for the registration of FIR. “The committee heard their submissions at length and reached the conclusion that one was a fit case for the registration of FIR,” committee chairman Raghav Chadha said. “Both the complainants also assured their support during the judicial process.”Interestingly, the nine-member peace and harmony committee was initially formed under Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj . The Delhi assembly secretariat on Monday reconstituted it and made Chadha, MLA from Rajinder Nagar , its chairman. However, no reason was offered by the assembly secretariat or the AAP government on the change.It was formed after communal riots rocked northeast Delhi in the last week of February with an aim to calm the tempers of people and restore peace and harmony in violence affected areas.According to Chadha, the committee received 7,732 complaints since its launch two weeks ago. Of 2,110 complaints it screened, the committee found 504 to be inflammatory, provocative and incriminating in nature. “We are examining all these complaints on a mission mode,” Chadha said.The committee contacted 120 complainants and nine agreed to appear before it to record their statements. “The committee will meet all the complainants and alleged offenders in due course,” he added.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74685772,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-428523,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-riots-house-panel-gets-nearly-8000-complaints/articleshow/74681772.cms
358,['18/03/2020'],Coronavirus scare: Maharashtra govt plans to allow quarantine unit in Mumbai's SevenHills Hospital,"Some private hospitals wary of state government move

MUMBAI: In what would be a unique arrangement, the state government plans to hand over one of the floors in SevenHills Hospital , Marol, to private hospitals to set up and run an isolation facility. In a related development, public health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday confirmed that the state has allowed private hospitals to admit and treat Covid-19 patients.TOI has learned that civic and state officials are in talks with two leading private hospitals to set up a well-equipped isolation facility on the Marol hospital’s third floor, where a 40-bed ICU currently exists. A source said the ICU may be converted into an isolation facility and more beds will be added to it. Two south Mumbai hospitals are likely to jointly run the facility by dividing the beds between them. “Essentially, we will be running the facility and providing the manpower. Currently, the quarantine facility started by BMC is only to observe patients, there is nothing much to actively treat them,” said a management official of one of the hospitals.As per the new protocol, BMC has started screening all travellers, who are then sent to SevenHills Hospital for a risk profile evaluation. Besides Category A travellers (with symptoms) who were tested, the civic body has also begun testing those with no symptoms but belonging to a high-risk community. As on Tuesday, every patient who had symptoms and required admission had to be sent to Kasturba Hospital. “An isolation facility in SevenHills where patients can be treated will ease that burden,” said the management official. Around 120 patients are currently undergoing treatment in Kasturba.A discussion took place in Tuesday’s state cabinet meeting on allowing private hospitals to take one floor each in SevenHills hospital. BMC sources said facilities like Bombay Hospital have said they can set aside a few beds.However, other private hospitals were apprehensive about whether Covid-19 patients can be treated with others. “Coronavirus patients can only be admitted in a specific kind of negative pressure room. At our hospital, we do not have that kind of facility, and we are not an infectious disease hospital. We are, however, in process of developing one or two such beds to support this initiative on an urgent basis,” said Dr Tarang Gianchandani, CEO of Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital. BMC’s Dr Daksha Shah said Fortis Hospital in Mulund too has started a 15-bed isolation facility.BMC officials have in the last month surveyed around 5- 7 hospitals to look at their preparedness. “There is also the issue of who will pay for treatment if patients were to go there. Fortis, for instance, is a paying facility. At Seven-Hills, however, patients don’t have to pay for their treatment,” officials said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74682641,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-208718,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-plans-to-allow-quarantine-unit-in-sevenhills-hospital/articleshow/74682223.cms

KOLHAPUR: Mango growers in the state seem unfazed by coronavirus though exports to foreign countries have been stalled. About 40% of the fruit produced in Konkan region is usually exported to the USA, Gulf and European countries.

Farmers as well as exporters said that since there will be a dip in the production of mangoes this season, they will not face any problem even if mangoes are not exported, adding that the produce will be more than sufficient to cater to the domestic need.

Anand Desai, a mango grower and exporter from Ratnagiri, said, “The outbreak of coronavirus will surely impact the mango export business as air service to all major exporting countries has been stalled. Mango is exported to European countries, Japan, Australia and USA through airways and Gulf by the sea. Usually the export of mangoes starts after April 15, but the contractors start visiting our sites to sign contracts in March every year. However, this year, rarely any contractor has visited our place to sign contracts for exporting mangoes. If this situation persists, it will affect the export business.”

“However, the mango production is expected to dip by 50% this year due to climatic changes and unfavourable environment. So, the rates of mangoes will remain high in the domestic market despite the reduction in the export,” he said.

Prasanna Pethe, another farmer and exporter, said, “Usually, we export mangoes to the United Kingdom and Qatar in March. This year, due to coronavirus we could not export mangoes. The export to the US and other countries takes place in late April and we expect that by that time the coronavirus threat will be reduced and the exports will be streamlined. The mango export continues till late May and there are possibilities of exporting mango after situation becomes normal. If the situation worsens further, it will be difficult for us to export the mango. However, the dip in mango production will help in meeting the demand-supply gap. This year, also the supply of mangoes will be less and the demand will remain high even if we could not export it as the available mango will not be able to meet domestic requirement.”

According to APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority), the mango export in 2018-19 worth Rs 385.62 crore was 48470 metric tonne. The production and export of mangoes in the last three to four years varies depending on the climatic and environmental conditions. Along with fresh mangoes, sliced, dried and mango pulp is also exported from India.

The government has granted Geographical Indication (GI) tag to the Alphonso mango from Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and neighbouring Konkan region.

TRICHY: Hundreds of fishermen and women from the coastal hamlets of Nagapattinam district besieged the collector’s office demanding permission for using the banned purse seine fishing nets.

The government had banned purse seine nets stating that they seriously harm marine species and adversely impact marine life. The government also conducts checks to prevent the use of such of nets in 13 coastal districts, including Nagapattinam.

The fisherfolk from Poompuhar and surrounding areas in Sirkazhi taluk gathered in front of the collector’s office on Monday and staged a demonstration. Police allowed representatives to meet district revenue officer (DRO) Inthumathi and submit a memorandum seeking government’s nod to use the nets.

TRICHY: While appreciating the Tamil Nadu government’s decision to close down all educational institutions over Covid-19 fears, Tamil Nadu Medical Students Association has appealed to the government to ensure adequate stock of face masks and hand sanitizers for them through Tamil Nadu Medical Service Corporation (TNMSC).

Association state secretary B Arunandhi asked the state government to declare holiday for undergraduate medicine students of all government and private colleges. The association cited the shortage of face masks and sanitizers with government colleges and hospitals as also in the market as the reason for their demand. “Undergraduate students on clinical postings at the hospitals are exposed and vulnerable to the virus. Instead of pushing them to the risky situation, they can be given holiday and sent home for their safety,” said Dr Arunandhi.

Associate general secretary Dr Hari Ganesh said that all undergraduate medical students were not healthcare providers and were students like the ones in other courses. The doctors, house-surgeons and post-graduate students also face the same risk in their line of duty of saving the lives of patients. “Sadly, they are also running short of safety measures at their work place. Hence, we appeal to the government to make face masks and sanitizers on their own and supply free of cost to the medicos,” said Arunanandhi.

The association also pointed out the exorbitant price of masks and sanitizers in the market. The double layer masks that were available for Rs 10 now cost up to Rs 40. “So the government should produce them in large amounts with the help of TNMSC and prevent scarcity. The government should install hand sanitizer points in public places,” he said.

COIMBATORE: With the installation of smart water meters in 200 houses at RS Puram under the 24/7 drinking water supply project nearing complete, the city corporation is likely to start metering water consumed in the houses on a trial basis soon.

Suez India Private Limited is installing 100 multi-jet water meters, 50 ultrasonic water meters and 50 electromagnetic water meters at houses selected randomly 15 days ago. “While multi-jet meters are cheap, the other two varieties will have long life. As the minimum starting flow of the meters differs, accuracy will also vary from a meter to the other. So, the performance of the meters will be studied for two to three months. Based on the performance report, the best meter will be chosen and used throughout the city,” a corporation official said.

Meanwhile, the company is also laying new pipelines and giving household water connections in RS Puram. As of now, it has given connections to 3,500 out of the 5,785 houses and laid pipelines for 34.7 kilometres out of the total 41.82 kilometres.

Corporation commissioner J Sravan Kumar had directed the contractor to complete the works in RS Puram by March so as to conduct a test run before extending the project to the other parts of the city.

But sources privy to the development said that the works may get delayed. The firm has not started work on DB Road because of the ongoing model road project. Also, the process is still on to obtain no-objection certificate from the national highways to dig up the Mettupalayam Road.

In addition to RS Puram, works are being carried out to lay additional pipelines and to replace the existing ones at Mulai Nagar and Pari Nagar near Papanaickenpudur , from Meena Estate to Sowripalayam, Jayaram Nagar and Cheran Nagar near Telugupalayam Road.

COIMBATORE: The quick-win lake beautification projects being implemented along the bunds of Ukkadam Periyakulam and Valankulam under the smart city mission are likely to be delayed by a few months.

Following the directions of state municipal administration minister SP Velumani, the city corporation had set March as deadline for the projects and had been speeding up the works.

But a source privy to the develsopment said that as the contractors do not have prior experience in carrying out such work, it is likely to be delayed. “They have completed close to 70% of the work and installed most of the important components. But as the lake beautification project is being carried out for the first time in the State, the contractors lack experience and expertise,” he said.

As the project is expected to set a benchmark when it comes to beautification of lakes, the officials want all components to be perfect, the source said. “So, the workers have to remove and rework on the components whenever a suggestion is made or chances for improvement are high.”

Each project has as many as 450 components like floating decks, gardens, birdwatching towers, mist fountains, shade structures, bicycle track, benches, lamps, container restaurants and native plant species along the bunds.

In another instance, a 15-year-old boy from Mettupalayam who returned from Sharjah on March 5, and a 49-year-old man from Cheranmanagar with a travel history to Hyderabad have also been also quarantined in the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). Their throat swabs were collected on Tuesday.

Dr G Ramesh Kumar, deputy director of public health, said, “The boy has been having fever on and off for the past 10 days. He passed the thermal scanner at the airport because he had a paracetamol earlier. He was, however, suffering from high fever for the past two days and that prompted him to come to us.”

The 49-year-old man had travel history to Hyderabad and Kochi by flight and bus. He has been suffering from fever, accompanied by cough and dry cough, for the past two days. He had approached Kovai Medical College Hospital , from where they referred him to CMCH.

Earlier, a 35-year-old man from Udumalpet with a travel history from Singapore, and a 67-year-old woman from Valparai with a travel history to Kottayam, were put in isolation and their test results are awaited.

District collector K Rajamani, meanwhile, said the testing centre that is being set up at Coimbatore Medical College, Peelamedu, would become functional by Thursday.

373,['18/03/2020'],SC gives 24-hr notice to Nath govt to respond to floor test demand,"New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave 24 hours to the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh led by Kamal Nath to respond to a petition filed by former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan seeking immediate floor test on the ground that the government had been reduced to a minority after the resignation of 22 MLAs.

It did not take much persuasion from senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi for a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta to order, “Issue notice. In view of the urgency of the situation, the notice is made returnable at 10.30 am on March 18, 2020.” It allowed the notice to be served through email and posted further hearing for Wednesday.

The MP assembly Speaker had accepted the resignation of six of the 22 MLAs and the MP Congress legislature party (MPCLP) swiftly moved the SC in the afternoon alleging that BJP had used money and muscle power to abduct the MLAs and kept them in captivity outside the state. It said if the floor test was to be held, it should be done after by-elections to the 22 seats which fell vacant upon the resignation of MLAs.

Before the MPCLP moved the SC, senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for the 16 MLAs, requested the bench to make them a party to the petition filed by Chouhan and other BJP MLAs.

Singh said the MLAs had resigned of their own volition, being peeved by the Kamal Nath government’s failure to serve the people. The 16 MLAs requested the SC to direct the Speaker to accept their resignations immediately. The bench ordered their petition to be served on the Kamal Nath government.

The 16 MLAs said, “None of the 22 MLAs either came out of Bengaluru nor did they appear before the Speaker. However, the Speaker for reasons best known to him accepted the resignations of only six MLAs on March 14.” While requesting the SC to direct the Speaker to accept their resignations forthwith, they said, “Floor test cannot be withheld under the pretext of the 16 MLAs not being available.”

The MPCLP petition, settled by senior advocate Devadatt Kamat, alleged that BJP had kept the 16 MLAs in complete isolation in Bengaluru to bring down the democratically elected government in MP by misusing the official machinery of the Union and the Karnataka government.

Accusing the governor of pre-judging the situation and directing floor test by concluding that the Kamal Nath government had lost majority in the House without taking into account forcibly taking away of 16 MLAs, MPCLP raised a constitutional question — whether a trust vote ought to be held in the absence of any representation of the electorate who had voted in support of the incumbent government.

“In the instant case, as 22 MLAs, who represent 22 constituencies constituting almost 10% of the total strength of the House, have purportedly resigned, the electorate of such constituencies are completely unrepresented. In these circumstances, a trust vote, if held, will be a complete sham and would be antithetical to the principle of representative democracy which is a basic feature of the Constitution. A floor test in such a situation ought to be held only after by-elections to the seats falling vacant as a result of resignations,” it said.

COIMBATORE: Forest department personnel rescued an elephant calf that fell into a water body in Periyanaickenpalayam range in Coimbatore district on Monday evening. They ensured that the calf reunited with its herd.

Around 6.45pm on Monday, the forest department received a message that an elephant seemed to be in trouble because many elephants were making noise in a place inside the forest.

“When we reached the spot, we realised that a one-year-old calf had fallen into a tank while drinking water. We then chased away the remaining nine elephants that stood around the tank. We ensured that no public came anywhere near the area and began the rescue operation,” said Periyanaickenpalayam forest ranger Suresh.

Forest department personnel broke down one side of the tank and allowed the calf to walk out of the water body.

The forest department personnel, numbering 25, then moved away and allowed the herd to return and join the calf again. “We saw the calf moving away with the herd comfortably,” said the ranger.

TRICHY: The Pudukkottai district administration has suspended all bull-taming events -- jallikattu , vadamadu and manjuvirattu -- till March 31 to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

Pudukkottai district organises the maximum number of jallikattu events in Tamil Nadu every year. More than five jallikattu events were happening in the district every weekend since the Pongal festival in mid-January.

District collector P Uma Maheswari said the decision had been taken after the state government on Monday asked people to refrain from organising any event that would witness mass gathering.

On Tuesday, the collector called for a meeting of the district tourism officer and officials from the Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE) department. She directed them to close down tourist places and defer religious festivals that were to take place before March 31.

Similarly, permission will not be given by the district administration to conduct jallikattu till March 31.

Speaking to TOI, Maheswari said that the district has already witnessed about 31 jallikattu events from January this year. “Permission was given to about 20 more venues but now we have deferred the events till March 31,” she said.

376,['18/03/2020'],"U’khand invokes Esma on health staff, no strike for 6 months","Dehradun: To tackle the spread of novel coronavirus, the state government on Tuesday invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act ( Esma ) on health department staff thereby barring them from taking part in any strike for six months.

According to a letter issued by additional secretary Yugal Kishore Pant, governor Baby Rani Maurya has given her approval for Esma on health staff in the state. It added that no health department employee, including doctors and paramedics, would be allowed to take part in any strike for the next six months as their services would be needed in combating coronavirus.

The development came a day after some OBC employees in the department announced that they would join the strike against the Supreme Court’s ruling on reservations in promotion.

Meanwhile, the health department on Tuesday collected samples of 19 suspected coronavirus patients in the state. While 10 were from Dehradun, six were from US Nagar and three from Haridwar. Similarly, samples of 27 trainee IFS officers were also collected by the health officials. The health department has so far sent 51 samples for Covid-19 testing, out of which 28 were found to be negative and one positive. The reports of 22 people are still awaited.

Food safety and drug administration commissioner Dr Pankaj Pandey also issued a letter to medical store owners and pharmacists in the state asking them not to prescribe any medication on their own to people suffering from common cold and flu, adding that they should make sanitisers available at affordable rates.

Teams from the Dehradun Municipal Corporation also sprayed bleaching powder and other disinfectants at various places across the city to prevent the spread of the infection.

INSET: An elderly couple from Vikas Nagar, who recently visited their son in Dubai, was brought to Doon hospital for Covid-19 testing on Tuesday after they complained of fever and cough. The doctors checked them inside the 108 ambulance and advised them to return home as they did not show any symptom. However, they had to spend over three hours inside the vehicle as the ambulance staff later refused to drop them home. The matter was sorted after CMO Dr Meenakshi Joshi ordered the designated ambulance staff to provide both pick and drop for suspected coronavirus cases.

378,['18/03/2020'],Trichy: Railways urged to waive cancellation charges,"Representative image

TRICHY: When the Union government has declared Covid-19 as a national disaster and is imposing travel restrictions on the general public, it is unfair for railways to charge cancellation fees, say frequent rail travellers. Railways should come forward to waive the cancellation charges so that commuters remain at home and check the spread of the disease, they say.

Secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai S Vimalnathan said he booked nine tickets for travelling to Thiruvananthapuram on March 19 to meet Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to thank him for fixing higher MSP for paddy. However, he was forced to cancel the tickets due to the evolving Covid-19 scenario. “The fare was Rs 560 for both up and down travel. After cancelling the ticket, I can get back only Rs 320, and forgo Rs 240 as cancellation charge. Railways is making money even after World Health Organization (WHO) announced Covid-19 outbreak as a pandemic”, Vimalnathan, who is also a member of divisional railway users consultative committee (DRUCC) said.

A Giri, advisor and media coordinator of Thanjavur District Rail Users' Association, has also appealed to the railway minister to waive the levy of cancellation fee on tickets booked for journeys up to April 15 and arrange for refunding the full fare. “Because of the virus attack, many passengers are cancelling their tickets. This will cause the loss of a huge amount to them by way of cancellation fee. Avoidance of such travel has helped the government to control mass spreading of the disease. The conveyance fee levied by IRCTC on those tickets while booking must also be refunded along with the ticket fare,”, he added.

He reportedly came to India with five others on March 6 to visit Hindu temples. He decided to return home on Sunday as he fell sick with fever and became very weak.Dr G Ramesh Kumar, deputy director of public health, said, “However, our thermal scanners in the airport detected his fever and we brought him to CMCH the same evening.

When he arrived, he was suffering from fever, light breathlessness and an infected ulcer in his leg.”Dr Sadagopan, medical superintendent, CMCH, said Khamidoi had a history of diabetic nephropathy and that renal failure was diagnosed almost immediately after he was admitted. “So, we began giving him peritoneal dialysis for his failing kidneys and antibiotics to bring down his temperature.

It was a shock for him and his family as, unlike his colleague from the same IT company who took ill, this professional didn’t have even a running nose.It took him a couple of days to realize that he has tested positive and needs to spend next two weeks in complete isolation, away from the family and friends. He has been kept at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) where mobile handset is his only companion.In a talk with TOI, the second positive patient from the city shares his experience and how he’s coping with it. He now advises all on taking utmost precautions to avoid getting contracted and on not to panic even if tested positive.Excerpts from the interview...You seem to have contracted the virus through your colleague.We three colleagues were together in the US and again met at Doha airport where we spent some time as the flight to India was late by three hours. Our first colleague, who has contracted the virus, was not keeping well at that time, but we thought it was due to his hectic schedule in the US. Frankly, we never imagined that he was sick due to coronavirus. After our colleague was found to have tested positive, the officials from the government’s disaster management team called me and family members at around midnight for testing our swab samples.What was the next step then? Did you panic?They told us to get immediately admitted, but I was unprepared. They shifted us to isolation ward where my colleague’s wife and I were offered separate rooms. We were surprised as both of us don’t have any symptoms till date of disease like cold, cough and fever. Though we’re fit, the doctors told us that we would act as virus carriers outside and therefore we need to stay for 14 days mandatory isolation.How do you pass the time in isolation?I’ve fixed a timetable for myself and sticking to it. I wake up early in the morning and get ready. Then I read a newspaper for a couple of hours. Later, I check my WhatsApp messages and speak with family members, friends and relatives. Both my sisters stay abroad and they also call me up. But due to poor connectivity, video calls can’t be made. I also read books and have fixed time for exercising every day. Being in a joint family is a big advantage as the members are constantly trying to pep me up. Our company is also supportive and helps in transporting our food from home to hospital and vice versa.How are the facilities at GMCH?Initially, they were not up to the mark but, in last couple of days, they’ve improved tremendously. The authorities have provided us rooms with attached toilets which are cleaned and disinfected daily. The doctors and nurses are very helpful and taking good care of us.

TRICHY: The public health and preventive medicine department has advised health centres to switch to conventional method of hypochlorite solution and bleaching powder instead of using Lysol IP solution, here on Tuesday.

The meeting, attended by around 200 people including government doctors and medical officers from private hospitals, was chaired by collector S Sivarasu at the collector collectorate.

At the training meeting, Dr S Dhanapal of department of microbiology at KAP Viswanatham Government Medical College , demonstrated how to produce disinfectant using hypochlorite, bleaching powder and water.

“Disinfectant remains a crucial part of fighting against Covid-19. The cleanliness of public places including hospitals is paramount. At the same time, the process should be cost effective so,” deputy director of health services Dr A Subramani told TOI.

Subramani said that the cost of making hypochlorite solution and bleaching powder will be three times cheaper than making 1% Lysol IP. “Only thing is the solution should be kept in a black container to avoid evaporation of the solution,” he said.

The public health department had encouraged people to use the Lysol IP (50% cresol and 50% liquid soap) as disinfectants. For hospitals, clinics and ambulances, 5% Lysol (one litre Lysol with nine litres of water) should be used. Bus stands, vehicles and other public places, should be disinfected with 2.5% Lysol (one litre Lysol in 19 litres water). Households can use 1% Lysol (one litre Lysol in 49L of water).

As hand sanitizers are out of stock in the outlets, the health department has planned to manufacture hand sanitizers on their own to supply to primary health centres and other government health facilities in the district.

NEW DELHI: A 23-year-old pharmacist working at a hospital in south Delhi has been arrested for kidnapping and murdering his 23-year- old relative with whom he was in a relationship since 2017. The girl’s body was found in Uttar Pradesh’s Rampur on February 6.

The accused identified as Heera Singh told police that he murdered her because she was against his decision of marrying someone else.

“Around 8pm on February 5, Singh had gone to meet his relative Priyanka. He had to give her an old phone as she had lost her mobile a day earlier. Meanwhile, an argument broke out between them over him getting married to another woman, as they were in a relationship. She threatened to teach him a lesson and left the room in anger,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, DCP, South.

The victim, who was also a pharmacist, subsequently rushed and took a bus from the BRT corridor. The accused followed her and entered the same bus. Before alighting at the Anand Vihar stop around 10pm, they quarrelled in the bus as well. “He calmed her down and told her they would get married in Rampur,” added Thakur.

The two then boarded a UP roadways bus, which was going towards Bareily. Around 4.30 am the next day, they got off at Rampur bus stop and started walking. The victim walked ahead of him and refused to listen in anger. As per the accused, the victim did not like his wife-to-be.

“Soon, a scuffle broke out between them and Priyanka allegedly slapped Singh. In a fit of rage, the accused picked up a brick and hit her at her face. She fell down after which he allegedly hit her six more times. Realising that she was dead, he threw his gloves at a nearby location and rushed to the Rampur bus stand, along with the victim’s purse,” said another police officer.

On the way, he threw the purse after taking out all the money and the cards.

“Singh returned to Delhi on February 6 as he had to appear for an MBA exam. On reaching here, he changed a few metro trains and then took a bus to reach his house around 11.30am. At 2pm, he even appeared for the exam at a centre in Noida,” said Thakur.

Priyanka’s relatives had called up the accused on February 7, but he denied having any information about her. Scared he would be caught, he also burnt the items he had stolen from her purse.

Students and parents appreciated the move aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus . TOI was the only newspaper to report about CBSE’s hush-hush plan on Tuesday.The central board took a proactive step by deciding to keep a distance of one meter between two candidates. A notice from CBSE mentioned that the distance has to be maintained “in order to avoid close contact and stay away from contamination of coronavirus”.CBSE went on to add that the “present practice of 24 students in a room must be avoided and not to be encouraged”. What helped schools in Maharashtra execute the plan to perfection was the availability of extra classrooms and zero distraction, thanks to the shutdown till March 31.A teacher said, “With all students staying home, all classrooms were at our disposal. Hence, we could provide double number of classrooms as required under the new guidelines.” But doubling up of classrooms did not mean extra invigilators. “CBSE gave permission to keep just one invigilator, instead of two, per classroom,” said the teacher.Students told TOI that they loved the new arrangement. A student said “It was a good change as the rooms became more airy. It was a good initiative by CBSE because it felt less claustrophobic.” Another student said, “Considering the panic over coronavirus, the new seating arrangement made me feel safe. In my centre, even teachers were wearing masks and that made everyone very comfortable,” the student said.At some exam centres, the host school had made arrangements for free masks. Administrator of one such school said, “These masks are there for use by both staff and students appearing for the exam if they so desire.”A student said that wearing face masks must be made mandatory for students too. “There were some students who were coughing and that really scared me. It might be a normal sore throat or allergy, but if such students are forced to wear masks, then it is better,” said the student.“The environment of the class was safe and hygienic. We sat at a distance of 1m from each other. We were also provided mask and there were hand sanitizers available in each class,” said Harsh Chandak, a student of Centre Point School , Katol Road.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74681820,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-65173,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbses-12-students-per-class-seating-plan-a-success/articleshow/74681821.cms
389,['18/03/2020'],Delhi court tears into Nirbhaya convict’s lawyer,"Convict Mukesh Singh

NEW DELHI: Unfortunately, some mischievous brains have been projecting and consciously nurturing a misplaced notion that there is a premium over dishonesty and mendacity in this country, said a Delhi court in a strongly worded order reprimanding the counsel of a death row convict in the Nirbhaya case.

“...the authorities involved in the dispensation of justice are duty bound to dispel such ill-founded notion,” it added.

The court slammed the counsel for “resorting to schemes” to obtain relief for his client. It also directed the Bar Council of India to take note of the matter so that the counsel is “sensitised”.

Coming down heavily on advocate M L Sharma, additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana said, “Counsel for convict has not only made a false averment before this court, but also miserably failed to discharge his duties as a counsel to bring all the facts before the court for effective dispensation of justice.”

The judge, while dismissing the convict’s plea, added that the counsel’s duty was all the more “sacrosanct” when viewed against the fact that the death warrants were to be executed on March 20, 2020.

The matter pertained to a plea of convict Mukesh Singh , represented by his counsel M L Sharma, claiming he was not in the city when the gangrape took place. He said his client was arrested by the police from Rajasthan in the early hours of December 17, 2012 – a day after the crime.

The court inquired why such an argument was raised at a stage when all legal remedies had been exhausted by the convict. Sharma claimed someone only recently gave him the information about Mukesh being tortured inside the prison that rendered him incapable to divulge this fact earlier.

Special public prosecutors Irfan Ahmed and Rajiv Mohan had opposed the claim arguing that it was a “frivolous” plea and not maintainable. He said that the convict was resorting to desperate tactics to escape gallows.

Upon going through the records, judge Rana found out that the same contention had been raised, dealt with and rejected by Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court in 2014 and 2017, respectively.

“It is a well-known fact that the courts of the country are over-burdened and are hard-pressed for time. The duty to deliver justice expeditiously becomes all the more onerous when the court is dealing with the case of a death row convict when one wrong decision may lead to fatal consequences,” the judge said. In such a scenario, the judge added, assistance from the Bar is more enhanced and intense.

Dehradun: The city's landmark Prabhat Talkies which had entertained generations of cinegoers since 1947 has now shut down. The iconic cinema hall was to close its doors forever after a screening of cult 1970s film 'Bobby' on March 30 but the order to temporarily close all cinema halls in the city till March 31 to contain the spread of coronavirus halted the plan of the cinema hall's owner Deepak Nagalia, to say goodbye to his establishment in the way he wanted. Nagalia who took over the theatre from his father, and has been running it for the last 55 years or so says that he had also invited Randhir Kapoor for the last movie show at his beloved theatre but ""perhaps it was not meant to be.""

“The frenzy that I witnessed for 'Bobby' remains unprecedented. Shows ran for over 25 weeks in Prabhat Talkies. My family has been very close to veteran actor Raj Kapoor, so, I had decided to close down the hall after screening a cult film made by Raj Kapoor,” said Nagalia.

Built in 1947, Prabhat Talkies was once the favourite of movie-goers in the city but the theatre had been running into losses for past many years. “The single-screen cinema halls have seen the golden era of Indian film Industry. Movies like 'Do Bigha Zamin', 'Mother India', and 'Devdas' revolutionised the Hindi film industry. But, it has now become tough for the single screens to survive in cities due to the advent of multiplexes. Leave aside profits, single screens are struggling to even recover operational costs,” said Nagalia whose family will now be converting the hall into a commercial complex. However, to keep the memory of Prabhat Talkies alive, Nagalia plans to dedicate a gallery to the cinema hall in the commercial complex. The gallery will have projectors, posters of iconic movies, and pictures of the movie stars who have visited the theatre for their film premieres in the past 73 years.

“Though I haven’t made any profit from the cinema hall for the last 10 years, it was a very hard decision for me to shut it down permanently. I have too many memories associated with the place,” he told TOI.

MADURAI: The Tirunelveli and Tuticorin district collectors submitted reports before the Madras high court with regard to the steps taken to safeguard Thamirabarani river.

A M Sundaravel, a resident of Tirunelveli district , in his petition before the high court Madurai bench had sought to safeguard Thamirabarani river from pollution by preventing the flow of waste from factories and local bodies. He also sought to remove the encroachments inside the river in both districts.

In his report, the Tuticorin collector stated that no industrial waste is released inside the river. No drainage water is drained inside the river from the 23 village panchayats which are situated on the banks. Though domestic waste was let inside the river in a few villages the same has been stopped by constructing soak pits. Effective steps are also being taken to remove the encroachments from the river.

The Tirunelveli collector in the report stated that sewage water is found mixing with the river in seven prominent locations in Tirunelveli Corporation limits. Though temporary measures are taken to prevent the flow of drainage water, the same would be completely stopped after the phase two and phase three works of underground drainage system are completed in 2021 and 2022 respectively. A joint committee has also been constituted to remediate pollution inside the river.

Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of justice P N Prakash and justice G Jayachandran adjourned the case to March 30 for further hearing.

393,['18/03/2020'],Come here and address media: Congress to rebel MLAs,"Representative image

BHOPAL: After rebels of the Scindia camp held a press conference in Bengaluru and targeted CM Kamal Nath , the state Congress went on the offensive, showing ‘before and after’ videos of the breakaway leaders, who went from praising the CM to criticizing him in just 10 days.

“Ex-minister for revenue Govind Singh Rajput , who claims that not a single paisa was allocated for his constituency, made a different comment before he left the state,” said law minister P C Sharma at a press meet. Congress showed videos of Rajput with the CM at a recent public meeting in Surkhi constituency, where he said, “Chief minister Kamal Nath has sanctioned Rs 3,000 crore for development work here. For 15 years, BJP government and former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan only made announcements. When I told this to CM Nath, he said, ‘Govind, I work and don’t make announcements’.”

The video shows Rajput saying that a reservoir that was pending since 2008 is being constructed now. “It was waiting for CM Nath, who has allocated Rs 100 crore for it,” he says.

A second video at Sharma’s press conference showed expelled minister Tulsiram Silawat praising CM Nath’s ‘Shuddh ke liye Yudhh (war for purity)’ campaign against food adulterators. Silawat was put in charge of implementation of the campaign. In the video, he is seen thanking the CM at a public meeting on behalf of citizens for the campaign against adulteration.

Congress also showed videos of expelled minister Imarti Devi questioning BJP’s criticism of Nath. “What did BJP do in 15 years that they dare question the Congress government?” she asks reporters in the video.

Sharma said: “There are so many videos coming from a resort in Karnataka with former ministers making some allegations. Why is the press conference in Bengaluru? They should come here, to Bhopal, or go to their constituencies and address the media here.”

“Before leaving for Delhi and then Bangalore, these were the same ministers who were speaking highly of the chief minister and the government’s developmental projects. In 10 days, everything changed. Nearly 87% families in Madhya Pradesh are benefiting from government subsidized electricity bills. Within an hour of his swearing-in, the CM signed papers to implement farm loan waiver for 55 lakh farmers,” Sharma said.

The rebel MLAs and expelled ministers are under “tremendous pressure from BJP for making anti-Kamal Nath statements”, he said. “What they are saying is the result of BJP’s influence,” he alleged.

On the floor test, Sharma said, “The floor is not complete without the 16 party MLAs who are in captivity in Bengaluru. Once they return and the floor is complete, the floor test will happen.”

Nath loyalist, PWD minister Sajjan Singh Verma , trained his guns on the Scindia faithful. Speaking to reporters, Verma said, “There are five to six bonded labourers (the expelled ministers) of Scindia who are speaking that language. Look at the rest of Congress MLAs, they are shopping in malls and talking over mobile phones freely. There are no restrictions. But in Bengaluru, if MLAs ask for their phones, they are being beaten-up.”

Asked about the rebels’ allegation that CM Nath did not listen to them, Verma said, “No one can be bigger liars than the persons who made this allegation.” Regarding the floor test, Verma said, “We are 100% sure this government will complete its full term. The name of management is Kamal Nath.”

According to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials, the civic administration sent around 350 tonnes of garbage to Uruli Devachi and Phursungi on Monday on experimental basis. On Tuesday, the quantity was increased to 400 tonnes.

Pune mayor Murulidhar Mohol said, “We had appealed to the villagers that they should allow the garbage-laden vehicles in the village in view of the coronavirus scare. The villagers accepted the request.”

The residents of Uruli Devachi and Phursungi had stopped entry of garbage-laden vehicles since February 28 as a mark of protest. Nearly 400 tonnes of garbage were processed in the plant at the depot in the two villages on Tuesday, a day after the villagers called off the agitation.

“The decision to send the garbage to Uruli Devachi and Phursungi for processing has been taken in view of the coronavirus scare. The process will continue in the days to come,” said Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of PMC’s solid waste management department.

According to PMC officials, around 2,100 tonnes of garbage are generated in the city every day. PMC claims that it has stopped open dumping at the garbage depot in Uruli Devachi-Phursungi. Only reject material like metal parts, plastic and others, which cannot be processed in the trash processing plants in the city, were being sent to the depot.

The villagers said the civic administration should take steps to meet their demands, including jobs for villagers and funds for infrastructure.

401,['18/03/2020'],"Sensex sheds 811 points, Nifty closes below 9k 1st time in 3 yrs","Mumbai: The markets see-sawed on Tuesday as fears of a pandemic-led global recession kept investors jittery. Local institutions tried to support the sensex at lower levels but eventually failed. The index opened about 200 points higher, lost 800 points within the first hour, then rallied nearly 500 points but finally, due to a fag-end selloff, settled with a loss of 811 points, or 2.6%, at 30,579—a three-year closing low. On the NSE , the Nifty lost 230 points, or 2.5%, to 8,967, its first closing below the 9K mark in the last three years.

The day’s selling was again led by foreign funds with a net outflow figure of Rs 4,045 crore, BSE data showed. Banking and financial services stocks were again at the forefront of the sell-off with ICICI Bank (down 9%), IndusInd Bank (8.9%) and Bajaj Finance (6.3%) among the top sensex laggards. Of the 30 sensex stocks, nine closed higher with HUL (up 3.5%) and Hero MotoCorp (3.1%) leading. The day’s selling also left investors poorer by Rs 2.1 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now almost at Rs 119 lakh crore.

With each passing day, as the epidemic spreads across the world and market after market enters bear territory, the chances of a recession is growing. A report by global financial services major Morgan Stanley on Tuesday said the fallout was likely to trigger a global recession.

“With Covid-19 spreading in Europe and the US after hitting Asia, the disruptions and dislocations in the economy and markets will trigger a year-on-year contraction in global growth in the first half of 2020. However, the strong monetary and fiscal policy response under way will help to revive global growth from the third quarter of 2020,” the report said.

On Monday night, the Dow Jones index in the US had lost nearly 13%, its biggest rout in more than 30 years. In early trades on Tuesday, the UK and German markets were also deep in the red but recovered in late trades as the US markets rallied over 3% after opening. In India too, the VIX, a gauge of volatility, reached a current peak of 63.4, NSE data showed.

Market players feel the volatility will continue for a while. According to Pankaj Bobade, head-fundamental research, Axis Securities, “Markets are expected to be volatile in the near term given the rise in new reported cases is outside mainland China than inside, marking a new milestone in the evolution of the global pandemic. As cases blow up in Europe and North America, fear is growing in Asia of the possibility of a second wave of infections from imported cases, which is driving risk aversion in markets globally.”

This, the Met office said, may make conditions conducive for spread of cold and flu, especially in the plains of Uttarakhand, and people have been advised to take extra precautions.

According to the regional meteorological centre, the diurnal variation (difference between maximum and minimum temperature) is likely to go above 18 degrees celsius during next the six to seven days in the plains.

Bikram Singh, director of the regional meteorological center, said, “Maximum temperatures are likely to increase gradually in the plains while the minimum temperatures are likely to remain near normal and thereby increasing the diurnal variability of temperature.”

The dry weather and high diurnal vibration in temperature is likely to make conditions favorable for spread of cold and flu, Singh said.

Incidentally, the temperatures in the Himalayan state were settling below normal level during last week due to rain, snow and thunder activity in both hills and plains.

On Tuesday, the maximum temperature in Dehradun was recorded at 27.7 degrees Celsius, while the minimum settled at 9.9 degrees Celsius, with diurnal variation of over 17 degrees Celsius. Similarly, the difference between maximum and minimum temperature in Pantnagar was over 18 degrees Celsius.

The Met office, meanwhile, has advised people and concerned state government authorities to take necessary preventive measures to ensure safety of common people.

405,['18/03/2020'],Coronavirus in Pune: Many firms drag their feet on work-from-home option,"PUNE: Many companies operating out of Pune are still in two minds about offering work-from-home option to their employees, citing lack of clear directions from the government.This is happening in spite of Pune collector Naval Kishore Ram’s appeal to the IT companies to allow their employees to work from home.“We appeal to all IT and other private companies to allow their employees to work from home because this social distancing measure is a very important proactive measure to contain the coronavirus spread,” Ram said in a video message on Monday.Soon after the message was put out, some big companies in Kharadi and Hinjewadi allowed their employees to work from home, while others remained open.“There are about 50 listed firms operating out of Pune. Of these, only a dozen have allowed their employees to work from home,” said an IT industry insider.With several companies still not warming up to work-from-home option, those still going out to their offices to work are finding themselves and their family members vulnerable to the Covid-19 infection.“My husband is allowed to work from home, while I have to go to work. Eventually, if one looks at it, my family not protected against the infection in any way,” Pimpri Chinchwad resident Shruti Narayanan, who works in Kharadi, said.A senior executive of the firm where Narayanan works blamed the clear directions from the authorities for the situation.“They (the company) are saying some people can work from home, while others cannot and that we will be receiving more communication on it. Don’t know what is on their mind since the plan to this effect was readied around three weeks ago,” the senior executive said.Some companies have gone for split work-from-home option, under which employees interchange the option every week.At a large manufacturing firm in Pune, office staff have been told to come to work every alternate day — leaving many to wonder about the efficacy of the move.“I don’t know if it will help, but looks like they are attempting to keep distance between employees,” a senior marketing executive of the company said.In a meeting held with the divisional commissioner on Monday, small industries said they were ready to shut if there was an order.“For now, the officials have told us that we must follow sanitation measures, which we are.

406,['18/03/2020'],"Clueless docs, gloveless staff serve those quarantined at MLA Hostel","Nagpur: From the threshold of block number 22 of MLA Hostel, a girl in her twenties flaunts her wrist to her sister standing at a distance, almost like she is showing off a tattoo.

She has been stamped ‘Corona 17-3-2020’ on her hand after she landed at Nagpur on Tuesday morning. “I have kept the sanitizer inside the bag,” says her father, who has also come to drop her lunch. The girl cannot cross the threshold. As the conversation gets longer, a state government official asks her to get back to her room. The family refused to divulged her name.

Since March 13, passengers coming from seven countries tagged as ‘corona affected’ have been kept in the MLA hostel block. So far, three have been released after initial tests and 11 remain at MLA hostel, said sources here. A state government press release has said so far 13 have been quarantined.

A press release issued from the divisional commissioner’s office said facilities to board as many as 1,500 quarantined persons are being created at Nagpur, including at Vanamati and Nag Bhavan.

Alleged uncertainty about their fate was among the major complaints TOI got while talking on phone to two of those quarantined. Some NRIs have also complained of the lack of proper facilities.

Akashsingh Rathore, a finance professional from Germany, reached Nagpur on Qatar Airways’ flight via Doha 36 hours ago. “My colleagues in other cities have been quarantined at home after initial tests. I am perfectly healthy and ready to stay isolate myself at home. I can be stamped and let off, There is no clarity, and even doctors here do not have a clue,” he says.

Thirty-year-old Rathore, whose family is from Chandrapur , has been quarantined along with his wife. His colleague Shashank Pataudi is next door, and has to go to Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh . “I have asked my parents not to come to Nagpur or get stressed. I am more worried about my work, which has come to a standstill,” he says.

Both Rathore and Pataudi were already working from home in Germany after the coronavirus outbreak. They decided to come to India and continue working from here. Lack of internet connectivity at MLA Hostel has affected their work, they say.

One inmate is also slated to get married in some days and still stuck here, they said.

Officials at the district collectorate managing the affairs said the decision to release a person is of the civil surgeon. However, civil surgeon Dr Devendra Paturkar passed the buck to the divisional commissioner’s office.

Even as the quarantined passengers are interacting with each other, their only view of the world outside is from the balconies. Their food comes from the MLA hostel canteen.

“There is a table outside their rooms. We just leave the food there and go away, and do not wait for them to come out,” said a canteen worker.

“Our life is at risk too, but except a mask there is hardly anything else in the name of safety gear. I don’t even have gloves so I cover my hand with a napkin to ring the door bell or even touch the door,” said a worker engaged in serving food.

The food is sent in cardboard packs. “We have not cleared the dustbins even once yet,” said one of the staffers.

The passengers arrive at MLA Hostel straight from the airport. A team of doctors is present before the immigration counter, where the countries they are coming from are ascertained. They are asked to board a bus under the protection of Disaster Relief Force personnel and taken to MLA hostel.

“They were helpful indeed but I saw that the disaster relief personnel did not even have gloves,” said a relative of one of the passengers.

The HC has appointed the advocate commissioner following a petition filed by activist Thakur Raj Kumar Singh on alleged encroachment in Madhavpuri Hills of Ameenpur in the city.

The land parcel — earmarked as a park area as per the approved HMDA layout plan with a total area of 9,867 square yards — was inspected along with other land parcels. “A temple was constructed inside the park area. The main temple of Lord Venkateswara along with other deities was constructed within the park area in an area of 1,225 square yards. Another small temple of Anjaneya Swamy adjacent to the main temple was also constructed. There is ongoing construction activity around Anjaneya Swamy temple. The total area covered by the main temple and Anjaneya Swamy temple is 1,426 square yards. The leftover area is 8,441 square yards which is covered by boulders and rocks,” said the advocate commissioner in his report.

The high court had taken a serious view of the petition filed against the temple encroachment and summoned principal secretaries of municipal administration, panchayat raj, HMDA commissioner and senior officers concerned. The HC bench then suggested to the Madhavapuri Hills temple committee to either demolish the illegal construction or pay Rs 5 crore.

Raj Kumar of Human Rights and Consumer Protection Cell Trust had filed the petition. Though a complaint was lodged in 2017, the authorities had failed to take action due to which the petitioner approached the court in 2018. The case came up for hearing now. Police and municipal authorities have so far failed to take any action.

The petition cites a news report that has said that the number of teachers working through forged documents is around 3,500.The bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe also ordered the secretary education to furnish the details as to what actions have been taken against the teachers who presented fake documents to secure the job. “The court has taken the matter very seriously and has ordered the secretary to furnish details both about the number of teachers and to inform what actions they have taken against the teachers who have been identified to furnish the fake documents to secure jobs,” said Tribhuvan Chandra Pandey, the counsel appearing for the petitioner.Though a Special Investigation Team (SIT) has also been constituted to probe the scam, the petition says that criminal cases have been registered against only 53 teachers.The PIL, while citing few cases of forgery, has highlighted that these teachers have no ability to impact knowledge or ability to impart knowledge and therefore by drawing salaries they are not only causing huge losses to the government but even the public at large is aggrieved by it. “We have examples where a person was in jail for almost six months for forging documents of 11 people, still they got a job as teachers.

PUNE: The authorities of the Jawaharlal Nehru Udyog Kendra, a children’s home in Yerawada, have decided to prevent minors who are with them, from coming into contact with coronavirus through contact with outsiders.

As a preventive measure, the authorities suspended all programmes organised for them.

“We have also obtained 50 masks and sanitizers for the minors and staff members,” superintendent G N Padghan told TOI.

Padghan said the security guards at the outer gate of the home have been told not send any person inside without applying sanitizers.

“We take efforts to reform these boys who are in conflict wit the law so that they can lead a good life after their release. We organise different programmes like meditation, yoga and motivational talks by speakers and we invite many outsiders to the home,” Pagdhan said.

They have stopped these activities for the protection of the children inside the home from Monday.

“We will continue with these activities once the situation is normal,” Padghan said.

Padghan said he has provided soaps at all barracks in the home. “We have been requesting the inmates to wash their hands regularly. “We have started lodging a limited number of boys in one barrack as a precautionary measure,” he added.

He said the home has a facility of visiting doctors. “These doctors check the inmates regularly. I have also told the staff members that if they noticed an inmate with any symptoms, they should immediately take him to the hospital,” Padghan said. Another official from the Jawaharlal Nehru Udyog Kendra told TOI, “At present there are 33 minor inmates. They have been kept in six barracks inside the home,” he added.

Doctors said symptoms can develop any time during the 14-day period.“Many factors influence the results. Sometimes, virus sensitivity is very low because of which the sample wrongly tests negative,” said Dr Ashwini Tayde , infectious disease specialist.According to her, that is the reason why “we insist that the 14-day standard quarantine period be completed irrespective of the test results”. “You may remain asymptomatic and your swab sample may test negative. Yet, you can develop symptoms any day during this period,” said Tayde.The Yavatmal woman was admitted in isolation facility of the GMCH on March 12 along with eight others. Their samples were collected on March 13. Four of them tested negative on March 14 while the remaining five were re-tested on March 15.Out of these, two came positive and three negative.

413,['18/03/2020'],Health officials to accompany cops for tracing escaped patients: Pune CP,"The police officers take part in Tuesday’s review meeting through videoconferencing

PUNE: Police commissioner K Venkatesham on Tuesday said his personnel would ensure that health officials, equipped with apt protective gears, accompany them for tracing and bringing back any Covid-19 patients escaping from designated quarantine facilities.

Speaking to TOI in the context of Saturday night’s incident in which a Covid-19 positive patient escaped from a designated quarantine facility in Bhosari, the Pune police chief said an isolation facility was being set up at the Police Hospital near Shivajinagar headquarters for the police personnel who might report symptoms of Covid-19 while performing duties like providing security to the quarantine facilities. The new facility would have all necessary medical equipment and medicines, he said.

Providing immunity tablets to women police personnel, allowing work from home wherever possible for pregnant staffers or offering them paid leave option, cleaning and disinfecting all police stations and police vehicles, and ensuring that basic protection was observed by all personnel were some of the measures taken for dealing with the situation, the police chief said.

The police in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, which have reported maximum number of Covid-19 positive cases in the state, are facing a unique challenge of not only providing security to the health establishments but also keeping a tab on patients at these facilities. Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad have a total police force of 10,000 and 4,000, respectively.

“Precaution is the best option for us as we can’t shut down police stations or establishments,” said Venkatesham, when asked about the challenges of the force in the prevailing situation. “Our primary role is to provide assistance to the health officials and we shall do that wherever called for,” he added.

Pimpri Chinchwad police chief Sandeep Bishnoi echoed Venkatesham on assistance to the state health officials.

He said, “We have placed an extensive focus on basic precautions to be taken by our personnel, including wearing masks, gloves and frequent use of hand sanitizers, besides, appealing to people to avoid visiting police establishments unless necessary and opt for e-services for lodging complaints.”

Bishnoi said, “We have provided about 4,000 masks and gloves each to our personnel and provided sanitizers. We have undertaken cleaning and disinfection work at all police establishments and police colonies.”

He said, “We have not prevented citizens from visiting our establishments, but given the current situation, we are encouraging people to opt for filing of complaint through emails. In urgent matters, people can certainly approach the police.”

Shridhar Jadhav, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said, “The use of thumb impression machines for attendance has been stopped and, instead, registers have been kept at all police establishments for marking attendance through signature.”

Another Pimpri Chinchwad police officer said the police had decided to stop using breathe analysers for taking action against drunk drivers. “Once the situation is normal, we shall resume the action,” he added.

He was speaking at the inaugural event of free competitive exams coaching centre for inmates of Adi Dravida hostel for girls atChinna Chokkikulam on Monday.

“If students work hard for just six months, they can bring about a change for a lifetime. Uneducated people who work on daily-waged job find it hard to provide good education for their children. As their children do not get education, they again languish in poverty. Students should prepare hard to get a good job and it should start when they undergo studies at college level itself,” he said. M Uma Mageswari , member, state women’s commission, said one should not stop education because of marriage and children. Women can continue education at any time of their life. They only have to realise that education is the only powerful tool to change their life.

District welfare committee member S Malaisamy and district dalit monitoring committee member B Pandiaraja took the initiative for the free coaching class. The class will be conducted on all days between 7 pm and 8 pm. In all, 270 inmates from three college hostels and one polytechnic college hostel will benefit.

415,['18/03/2020'],Administration ask suspects for home quarantine after isolation ward scare,"Nagpur: The episode of four suspected cases of the novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) giving the slip to the Mayo Hospital administration on Friday night has brought to the fore issues like lack of management and confusion over isolation and quarantine measures.Even as there is no clarity on the contentious issue, the administration announced that it will ask people to follow home quarantine.The four in question were asked to wait at the hospital till the results of their throat swabs were out. As per the hospital authorities, these suspects were ‘quarantined’ in the isolation ward.While briefing the press on Saturday, district collector Ravindra Thakare said, “The suspects left without permission as they feared contracting the virus from the positive patient.”The ward is on the same floor of the same building, Ward number 5 and 6 of Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (Mayo Hospital), where Nagpur’s first positive Covid-19 patient was admitted for treatment.This is in contravention of the best medical practices which prescribe isolation of a sick person from those who are not sick. Quarantine means separating those who have come in contact with infected persons and observing them if they show any symptoms for 14 days.As per the World Health Organization ’s (WHO) interim guidance issued on February 29 to contain Covid-19 virus, “Quarantine of persons is the restriction of activities or separation of persons who are not ill, but who may been exposed to an infectious agent or disease, with the objective of monitoring symptoms and early detection of cases. Quarantine is different from isolation, which is the separation of ill or infected persons from others, so as to prevent the spread of infection or contamination.”When TOI asked Thakare why the isolation ward was being used as a quarantine facility, he said, “What is the problem? When he (the first positive patient) lived in his house for some days, only his wife tested positive. We are taking all preventive measures. There are over 20 persons quarantined in the isolation ward. Nursing staff and doctors are more exposed. 80 people have so far been inspected. They are there only for two to three hours,” he said.Mayo dean Ajay Keoliya said rooms for suspects and confirmed patients are separate. “One or two persons are kept in a room during their wait for test results. Each positive patient is kept in a separate room having separate toilets. There is a distance of an entire corridor,” he said.Yet, in the wake of the apprehension of people coming forward for getting themselves tested and being anxious to wait, the district collector announced that from Saturday “home quarantined” would be followed in all such cases.Earlier this week, home quarantine guidelines were issued by the union health ministry to contain the Covid-19 virus. In fact, on March 12, divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, too, had said that teams would be formed to collect swab samples and people should adhere to ‘home quarantine’.Lack of coordination and management leading to non-compliance of the plan has raised a question on measures to fight the contagious diseases.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74681867,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-100112,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/administration-ask-suspects-for-home-quarantine-after-isolation-ward-scare/articleshow/74681868.cms

But she initially fled the hospital, refusing to get admitted to the government facility, fearing dirty wards, unhygienic toilets and poor services.But a visit to the hospital’s isolation wards, earmarked for treating Covid-19 patients as well as those suspected of being infected with coronavirus, presented a picture in contrast: 24 small, clean, single-bed cabins line Ward IB6, completely isolated from each other. Each cabin has an attached toilet. Though the nursing station is common, the facility has separate sets of portable equipment,like ventilators and ECG machines. This 24-bed quarantine ward at the state’s nodal hospital for infectious diseases was the first lot of isolation beds that the state health department had reserved for treating coronavirus suspected cases as well as those infected.Till Monday, the hospital had dealt with more than 50 people suspected of being infected with coronavirus but none had tested positive. However, on Tuesday Bengal recorded its first Covid-19-positive patient. “These isolation wards are designed for highly contagious diseases. While one section of the ward at the hospital was created when Nipah virus cases were reported, the other section is meant for swine flu patients. These wards are barely used as they are kept for only an outbreak like this,” said ID&BG Hospital principal Anima Haldar. The hospital has another isolation ward with 12 cabins, which was set up when Ebola cases were reported. “That section was never used. This, too, can be used for Covid-19 patients if need be,” Haldar added.Four beds in the intensive care unit have also been kept aside in case someone does test positive for the virus and needs intensive care unit support. In addition to the nursing and para-medic staff, a small team of doctors has been formed to deal with Covid-19 suspected cases. The core team comprises only three doctors—Shekhar Ranjal Paul from the department of medicine who has been trained in handling Ebola cases, microbiologist Kheya Muherjee and chest specialist Koushik Chowdhury who recently attended the WHO workshop on Covid-19 in Delhi. “As the number of patients increases, manpower shortage could be a crisis soon,” said a hospital insider.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/24-id-cabins-with-attached-toilets-have-hosted-over-50/articleshow/74680814.cms

PUNE: The Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) on Tuesday confirmed that all of its academic activities — classes, workshops, film shootings — would remain shut till at least April 6, in the wake of the novel coronavirus spread.

“As had been advised by the Maharashtra and the Central government, we have announced that all classes and workshops and all academic activities will be postponed till April 6, to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus infection,” Bhupendra Kainthola, the Film and Television Institute of India director, told TOI.

However, the date can also be extended, subject to instructions from the state government, he said.

It could cause delay of months with respect to the completion of the current semester as well as in the induction of the new batch, whose admission process is still underway, he said.

The admission test was conducted in February this year.

“The shootings of the diploma films will take place when the students come back after the academic activities resume. The classes for the current semester will also resume then. If there are any further postponements, the semester completion will be delayed because the courses need to be completed,” Kainthola said.

Pune: After Kendriya Vidyalaya announced on Monday that children from Standard I to V would be promoted without taking exams, some schools in Pune have begun exploring such options while some have implemented it. Some schools have announced promotions based on average scores of two unit tests and one term exam.

City Pride School in Nigdi sent a message to parents of students studying in the school which stated: “Grade promotion decision for all students will be based on the average scores of the previous tests conducted during the academic year. Final exams shall not be conducted for this session in order to compensate for the lost time from the academic session.”

Director of the school, Ashwini Kulkarni said, “There is enough panic and fear and we do not want to add exam pressure to it. So the decision to promote students was taken so that parents are relieved.”

Many non-state board schools have just completed the exams or were in final phases while the exams of the state board schools were scheduled from March 30.

A decision on state board schools would be taken by the government. ICSE and CBSE schools have the liberty to take a call depending on the situation.

At BVP English Medium High School, Dhankawdi, two papers were to be conducted for all classes when the shut down was announced.

As per CBSE guidelines, schools have to follow a ‘no detention policy till class VIII’. “It is better that the students from classes I to VIII be promoted based on average scores. However, for classes IX and XI, balance two papers will be conducted and promotions granted as per the CBSE policy,” principal Simple Sahay said.

Rita Katawati, principal of Hutchings High School, said, “ We are giving promotions a thought.”

Varsha Kokil, principal of Mansukhbai Kothari National School, said, “Since the schools are closed till March 31, we are planning to calculate the average marks of one subject which students have missed. We are also considering online classes and teachers are working from home.”

Amruta Prabhu, principal of The HDFC School, Pune, said, “Being a CBSE affiliated school, we have finished our final exams last week as scheduled. The results are being tabulated which shall be posted on the parents’ portal on the scheduled date

People are queueing up, waiting for the stores to open, so that they can pick up essential supplies before stocks are exhausted. Store employees say they are witnessing an unprecedented rush for foodgrains and essentials with people wanting to stock up for at least two months.Take the case of one hypermart on Free School Street that opens at 7am but gets reasonable footfalls only after 8 am. This one hour is spent in cleaning because of lack of footfall. “But for the past four-five days, we are seeing an unprecedented upward curve, not only in footfall but also in the quantity that people are buying. We were caught off guard initially because even when we had doubled our stocks, we were not being able to cope with the rush,” said an official.All varieties of rice, lentils, cooking oil, salt, sugar, flattened and puffed rice and biscuits are getting exhausted by the first half of the day in most stores. “We have noticed 100% rise in demand of foodgrains in some stores. This is a result of panic buying. Initially, we were not able to cope because we were following a regular replenishing pattern but we have more than doubled that as well,” said an official of a group that runs a chain of hypermarts.“In the past week, we have had to replenish store shelves more often. Even then, we have repeatedly run out of stock. This is true for not just hand sanitizers and personal hygiene products but also for staples and essential food items,” the head of a hypermarket chain that has over a dozen stores in Kolkata said.While the company had attempted to increase the inventory at the stores in Kolkata after witnessing unusual demand in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi and other cities, even the new projections are failing in the wake of spiralling demand. “Customers are picking up as much groceries and staples in one visit as they usually did in four trips,” he said.At another hypermarket company, the depots are working overtime to ensure that the stores are replenished on time. “We usually do not stock up the store at night. But such is the rush during the day that we are having to run a night replenishment service too,” the operations head of the chain said.Though sales of essentials has shot up, it has not translated to higher footfalls or hike in revenue as customers are staying away from gourmet items and other personal care categories like cosmetics.

430,['18/03/2020'],Last meeting done for all but 1 convict,"New Delhi: The family members of three Nirbhaya convicts have already had their “last meeting” , when they were allowed to meet in a closed room and touch each other . However, Akshay Thakur’s family is yet to come and his wife and parents have been asked to meet him by Thursday, a Tihar Jail source said.

The four death-row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape-and-murder case are scheduled to be hanged on Friday.

An official said the family members of Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma met them on February 29. Both of them broke down and jail officials had to console Sharma after he started crying inconsolably, he added.

The other convict, Mukesh Singh, mostly kept quiet during his meeting on March 2 while his family members had occasional emotional outbursts, a source said. Singh apparently kept assuring them that he still had legal options left to save himself from the gallows. The high court on Wednesday rejected Singh’s plea claiming he was not in Delhi when Nirbhaya was gang-raped in a moving bus in south Delhi.

Even after the “last meeting”, the families are allowed their weekly interactions with the convicts, but no one-on-one meeting is permitted.

Thakur, meanwhile, had told the Tihar authorities that his family members would meet him on Wednesday. An official said he seemed to have lost hope that his family members would meet him after his wife decided to seek a divorce.

“We facilitated a phone call between him and his wife after this. He then claimed that his wife would come and meet him on Wednesday,” said the official. His wife, Punita Devi (29), has filed a divorce case in a court in Bihar’s Aurangabad, saying she doesn’t want to live the rest of her life as a widow.

Meanwhile, the preparations for the hanging are in full swing and dummy executions have been carried out. Officials are also keeping a tab on the health of the four men and additional staff have been deployed outside their solitary cells to avoid any untoward incident.

Another accused, Ram Singh, committed suicide inside Tihar, while a juvenile has been freed after serving his term at a Home.

435,['18/03/2020'],"131 passengers, close contacts advised home quarantine","Nagpur: The divisional commissioner office on Tuesday said it has advised self-isolation to 131 first-point contacts and passengers who have landed in the city since last week when the first novel coronavirus positive case was reported here.

The administration would now keep a check on these people through local police stations, beside stamping ‘home quarantine ’ on their hands.

On Monday, state health minister Rajesh Tope had said that flyers advised self-isolation would be stamped to deter them from stepping out. Over 600 people from the state have been directed to be home quarantined.

Of the 131 persons, 35 have completed 14 days in self-isolation as per the data released by the commissioner’s office.

Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar told TOI, “Besides stamping, a list of such people is also being forwarded to local police stations. People can report in case they find ‘home quarantined’ persons loitering or mixing with others.”

Even as the divisional commissioner’s office came out with a detailed list of number of people being quarantined after reaching Nagpur airport from different entry points, there remains ambiguity over the home quarantine process and guidelines among officials as well as citizens.

When TOI checked with officials manning the district administration control room, they sounded unaware about the ‘home quarantine’ advisory. Despite clearing asking if international flyers were being stamped, they said first one has to go for a test only after which ‘home quarantine’ can be advised.

“Suspect has to be kept separate and the room has to be hygienic. He shouldn’t be allowed to mingle with other family members. If they have any kind of fever, cough or sickness, get them to one of the government hospitals for a test. You can also call and inform NMC helpline for further assistance,” an official said.

Kumar clarified that no one has to go to Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital or Government Medical College and Hospital. “All such persons have to stay back at home only. In case they are found to be out, police action under section 188 of the IPC can be taken,” he said.

On Tuesday, the health officials screened 22 passengers at the airport here. Of these, seven were quarantined at the MLA hostel. So far, 1,004 have been screened of which the 131 were advised self-isolation and total 13 at MLA hostel.

During the day, the commissioner held a meeting with district collector Ravindra Thakre, deputy director of health services Sanjay Jaiswal, DCP Shweta Khedkar, DCP Vikram Sali, PWD executive engineer J Bhanuse, revenue deputy commissioner Sudharkar Telang, and civil surgeon Devendra Paturkar .

The meeting was called in the wake of increase in number of incoming international passengers, especially those coming from notified nations.

These cheques are different from the Rythu Bandhu cheque where farmers, by producing the cheque with identity proof could take out the amount from any bank.“The government has ensured that farmers withdraw cash from their accounts only. The measure was adopted to avoid misuse of cheques,” an official explained.The non-performing asset (NPA) accounts have been made ineligible in this cycle, as reported these columns earlier. It would mean that those who have outstanding loans before April 1, 2014, will not be eligible to get the waiver.Farmers, who have outstanding loans between April 1, 2014, and December 11, 2018, will only be able to avail the benefit. The government had earlier not mentioned the date from which outstanding loan would be considered but only mentioned a cut-off date.Many farmers who have not cleared their loans for more than a decade were also getting the waiver in the last cycle, which won’t happen this time. Banks consider accounts having loans which are not paid for three seasons or more than one-and-a-half year as an NPA.In view of several court cases pending earlier on restructured loans, the government has incorporated the new clause this time, officials pointed out.

437,['18/03/2020'],CAT upholds former AP intel chief ’s suspension,"Hyderabad: The Central Administrative Tribunal , Hyderabad, on Tuesday upheld the suspension of Andhra Pradesh’s former Intelligence chief AB Venkateswara Rao .

It also said the state government has powers to place an All India Services (AIS) officer under suspension as per the amended rule of 1975.

Dismissing Rao’s contention that he was suspended by the AP government without any proof or material, CAT said the government had placed him under suspension after coming across prima facie material. “Hence, at this stage, it cannot be said that there is no material warranting his suspension,” a bench of tribunal chairman Justice L Narasimha Reddy and member BV Sudhakar said after hearing the arguments of the suspended IPS officer and the government.

Rao was suspended for his alleged role in awarding a tender pertaining to procurement of security equipment for police personnel and charged with short-listing an Israeli firm which had business links with an enterprise floated by his son.

The bench brushed aside the contention of Rao that without a charge memo, he cannot be suspended.

The bench said it was not looking at the sufficiency of the material against the petitioner which was not required here.

The bench also did not agree with the contention of the petitioner that he need not be suspended because he was sent out of police department in June 2018 and hence he was not in a position to influence the inquiry against him.

Rao’s cousel argued that the government did not intimate the Centre within 48 hours of his suspension as required under AIS rules and said there was a gap of more than 48 hours in intimation. The bench did not agree with this and said the rule is directory and not mandatory.

The bench said the Centre had to approve the suspension within 60 days as otherwise the suspension would lapse. “In this case, the Centre had already approved the suspension (on March 7,” the bench added.

In a circular issued by the department of health and family welfare to the district medical and health officers on Monday, the Asha workers were directed to report on the status of home isolation of incoming international passengers to medical officers concerned twice-a-day.

Meanwhile, ANMs (auxiliary nursing midwifery) will be responsible for monitoring the Asha workers. The medical officers concerned, ANMs and Asha workers will be held responsible for any lapse in the home isolation process, which is said to be an effective precautionary measure to protect others from contracting COVID-19.

According to estimates, about 6,000 people returned to Andhra Pradesh from aboard in the recent times. But the huge network of ward/village volunteers, ward/village secretaries, Anganwadi workers, Asha workers and other field-level staff will prove to be an advantage for the state government to monitor and contain the spread of the disease.

The state election commission on Tuesday clarified that the model code of conduct will not be applicable for any measures taken by the state government to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Special chief secretary (medical and health and family welfare) KS Jawahar Reddy has asked people, who have returned from COVID-19 affected countries in the recent times, to self-isolate irrespective of whether they have the symptoms of the disease or not.

“We have identified 840 foreign returnees from coronavirus-hit areas. While about 560 persons have been kept on home isolation, the 28-day observation period was over for 250 persons after being overseas. Nearly 30 persons have been admitted to isolation wards and are under the supervision of the medical personnel,” said Jawahar Reddy.

The special chief secretary asked the public to be wary of rumours related to coronavirus circulating on social media platforms. “We will initiate stern action against those spreading misinformation and fake news on social media and through other means,” said Jawahar Reddy.

Even though the state government has not declared holidays for educational institutions, several schools and other organisations in Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam have declared holidays for the next few days till the situation returns to normal.

The Simachalam Devasthanam in Visakhapatnam, with the assistance of a private hospital, has conducted an awareness programme on the preventive measures of the pandamic and distributed protective masks to devotees on Tuesday. The temple also cancelled all the ‘Arjitha Sevas’ and has only been permitting devotees for ‘Laghu Darshan’.

Jaipur is part of the golden triangle of tourism that includes Delhi and Agra.Commenting on the move, ASI superintending archaeologist VS Badiger, Jodhpur circle, said, “It is a precautionary measure taken to strengthen the fight against coronavirus. Most of the ASI protected sites in Rajasthan receive thousands of visitors every day making them vulnerable to the virus. So, we have closed them for tourists and locals.”Soon after the order reached site offices around noon, officials started preventing the entry of tourists.The closure will have a huge impact on hospitality and related businesses in destinations like Jaipur, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Ajmer.With about 8,000 to 10,000 visitors on a lean day, Amber Fort and Hawa Mahal in Jaipur are the most visited historical sites in the state.

Besides Khajuraho, the famous Ram Raja temple of Orchha has also been closed down in view of the Coronavirus spread.In a bid to prevent assembly of large number of people and check any spready of coronavirus, Mahakaal temple in Ujjain was already shut down for the devotees earlier this week. In fact, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has shut down all its monuments across the country till March 31.A group of French tourists that reached Khajuraho on Tuesday morning was a disappointed lot. Narendra Sharma , tour guide accompanying the group, said, “These tourists reached here from Agra; they are obviously disheartened to learn about the closure of the temple site. All the French tourists, however, understand the gravity of the situation and agree with the steps initiated to check the spread of Covid-19, were essential.”One of the French tourists, Sronsos, told TOI, “ I have come all the way from France to Khajuraho; I had read a lot about these temples of archaeological importance. Having travelled this far, I could only see the temples from outside the gates. It is quite disappointing, but then I realise that such steps are the need of the hour to keep people safe.” Another tourist, Alley, also agreed with Sronsos and added, “ All of us will visit Varanasi before we leave for our country.”About 100 kms away in Orchha, the Ram Raja temple was closed down for devotees. A notice board at the entrance of the temple informed the visitors that the temple was closed down to check the spread of Coronavirus till further order. However, a large number of villagers who have been reaching Orchha expressed anger over the decision. Some of them even claimed, “ No virus can infect the devotees visiting the temple.”District collector of Niwari, Akshay Kumar Singh , however, made it clear that rituals of daily puja and the tradition of guard of honour to the deity will continue in the temple.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74688813,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-190954,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-19-effect-khajuraho-orchha-temple-closed-for-tourists/articleshow/74681897.cms

KALIYAKKAVILAI ( KANYAKUMARI ): Traders at the Kaliyakkavilai border have stopped or drastically cut stocks of perishable commodities such as milk, dosa batter and vegetables from Monday night fearing closure announcement for shops too. “After malls and places where public gather in large numbers, we fear closure announcements for shops too. So we did not want to take chances of stocking perishable commodities,” said a grocery shopkeeper. Some shops remain closed while the rest hardly have buyers. However, some residents have been stocking essential supplies. “Last evening we had at least 10 customers buying 20 to 30 kgs rice instead of the usual 5 or 10 kilos,” said a trader. One of the three lodges with 20 rooms is closed from Monday night following the government’s order.

At the Kaliyakkavilai RTO check post, health department officials conducted random checks on vehicles bearing Kerala registration number. While officials said they disinfected handrails on buses and tourist vehicles and passenger carriers from Kerala this was not the case. Of the four KSRTC buses that crossed the check post in a span of 10 to 15 minutes they stopped one. Random temperature checks were done on a few passengers who were also told in Malayalam to avoid touching their face till they washed their hands after getting off the bus.

“Touching hand rails in the footboard and inside the bus could result in contracting Covid-19,” said an official. However, the handrails of the bus too were not disinfected. Health officials at the check post were awaiting adequate stock of hand sanitizers and masks. However, such random checks and occasional distribution of awareness pamphlets were not carried out in the dozens of small check posts connecting Kanyakumari with Kerala. There were fewer passengers on buses due to closure of education institutions on either side of the border.

445,['18/03/2020'],Will schools turn English medium this year? Govt awaits HC verdict,"Visakhapatnam: Uncertainty continues over making English the medium of instruction for classes 1 to 6 from the next academic year (2020-21) as there is a case pending for disposal on the issue with the high court .

Recently, the high court issued an interim order advising the state government to not proceed with printing textbooks in English and holding training programmes for teachers until the court delivers its verdict .

For now, the high court has reserved its judgement on the PIL (public interest litigation) petitions moved challenging the state government’s decision to introduce English as medium of instruction from the primary level.

A source in the state education department said officials will be able to take a final call only after the court’s verdict. “The department cannot take a firm decision on training of teachers and (on) other preparatory measures for English medium schooling till the court delivers its judgement,” said the source.

According to the state government, the decision to introduce English as medium of instruction was taken on the basis of the demand from parents and to provide quality education to children from economically disadvantaged background.

Officials say that the education department had recently sought opinions from parent committees of more than 47,000 schools , wherein 97 per cent favoured English medium.

The state government has further argued that converting schools to English medium will reduce the financial burden on parents who have to send their wards to private schools for the purpose and will also bring the fruits of English medium education to students of public schools.

Demand for English medium schooling has gone up sharply in Andhra Pradesh. According to data provided by the department of school education, around 3.82 lakh English medium students appeared for the class X exams in 2019. The number of students from Telugu medium was a relatively mere 2.3 lakh. Thereby, indicating a decline in number of students opting for education in their mother tongue.

Meanwhile, 2,600 students appeared for the exam in Urdu medium, 544 in Kannada medium, 357 in Tamil medium and 13 in Hindi medium.

The affordability of private education coupled with parents taking a fancy towards English medium education has drawn students towards state board private schools. Given the higher number of schools in vicinity and local factors, admissions to English medium schools have increased manifold over the years.

However, a section of educationists have requested the state government to leave the choice of medium to parents and students instead of forcing English medium on them. Some have argued that the move will have far reaching consequences for the Telugu language as well.

446,['18/03/2020'],"Rao, Venkanna refuse to record statement","Guntur: The case related to the attack on TDP functionaries in Macherla has taken a new turn with police summoning them to record their statements. TDP leaders Bonda Umamaheswara Rao and Budha Venkanna, who were attacked in Macherla last week when they were going to resolve an issue related to a party activist’s nomination for MPTC post in the constituency, have, however, refused to go to Macherla.

South Coastal IG J Prabhakara Rao said they have appointed Gurazala DSP Srihari Rao as investigating officer by removing local inspector Durgaprasad from the responsibility to ensure an impartial probe. He said the decision was taken as per the instructions of DGP Gautam Sawang. “It is normal procedure to conduct the investigation at the place where the offence took place. In case people fear for life while attending the inquiry, it will be the responsibility of the police to provide adequate security,” said Prabhakar Rao.

He also took strong exception to TDP leaders’ comments against the police. “The victims should first attend the inquiry and give their account of the incident. It is not fair on the part of the leaders to make false allegations. Police are never associated with any political party, neither the ruling party, nor the opposition, nor some other front. Our prime duty is to maintain law and order and ensure public safety,” the IG said, while adding that they would take all measures to see that the accused are punished if the victims cooperate with the police.

However, the TDP leaders refused to appear before the police in response to the notice served to them under section 160 of CrPC. Bonda said that they have no trust in Guntur Rural SP Vijaya Rao and Macherla CI as they had colluded with Macherla MLA Pinnelli Ramakrishna Reddy. He further alleged that the same Macherla police became co-conspirators in the murder attempt by passing information on their movements to the MLA and his henchmen. “The latest notice is another murder conspiracy by Pinnelli, his brother Venkatarami Reddy and the local police,” alleged Bonda.

The ruling party leaders are unhappy that the murder attempt was not successful and have now hatched a conspiracy with the help of the police, Bonda said, adding that they would file a private case in the high court. He also demanded that the DGP should check the call data of the Guntur Rural SP, Macherla MLA, accused Kishore and others before checking the call lists of TDP leaders.

447,['18/03/2020'],Navy will have to train women for warship postings,"NEW DELHI: Many nations around the globe, including even Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, deploy women on warships. Some like the US and France allow women to serve on board the cramped confines of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines as well.

After the Supreme Court judgement on Tuesday, which granted permanent commission (PC) to women officers in the Navy, India too will eventually have to look to follow suit. The Navy will have to get cracking on developing the requisite facilities to train and deploy women on warships, the absence of which has been used in the past to bar them from serving on board sea-faring vessels.

This is also directly connected to granting PC to women because “sea time” is mandatory for promotion to the rank of Captain (equivalent to Colonel in Army ) in the Navy, except in a few branches like naval constructors and armament inspectors.

Navy officers say the process will have to be gradual because it will pose administrative and operational challenges for the force. There will, for instance, have to be enough women volunteers who opt for the “tough life” on warships, which are usually sent on mission-based deployments for 70 to 90 days at a stretch.

At present, the around 550 women among the over 10,000 officers in the Navy -- which has 130 warships, 17 submarines and 235 planes, helicopters and drones -- are restricted to what are called “shore-based billets and aircraft”.

But the six brave women officers who circumnavigated the globe on sail boat INSV Tarini during the eight-month gruelling “Navika Sagar Parikrama” in 2017-2018 proved they are second to none in sea-going capabilities. The six, incidentally, got Nao Sena Medals for gallantry.

Necessary infrastructure will be another major pre-requisite. “Except for some newer warships like the Shivalik-class frigates and Kolkata-class destroyers, the majority of our warships – mostly of Russian-origin – do not have separate bathroom, cabins and other facilities that can be used by women,” said a senior Navy officer.

Added Captain D K Sharma (retd), “The Supreme Court’s decision is welcome but the Navy will have to look into the finer details like training, facilities and other aspects at every stage for implementation.”

The new warships being ordered by the Navy are designed to cater for women officers, with separate cabins and bunks with attached bathrooms. “US warships, for instance, have separate areas or decks earmarked for women. In most of our warships, officers take bath in open toilets,” said another officer.

“Women officers who opt to serve on warships will also have to undergo courses in anti-submarine warfare, gunnery, communications and the like. Moreover, a minimum number of women will have to be posted together on every warship. Then, women doctors will also have to be ready to go to sea. All this will take time,” he added.

The Navy has progressively increased the avenues for women from three branches in 1992 to 11 non sea-going branches in 2019 but has kept them firmly away from warships, much like the Army has excluded them from combat arms like the infantry, mechanised forces and artillery.

It was only recently the Navy began inducting women pilots in its maritime reconnaissance stream, with three women officers having got the “wings” to fly Dornier-228 aircraft as of now. “Eventually, the Navy will also have women flying the latest Poseidon-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft, which have potent anti-submarine warfare capabilities,” said an officer.

But the fact also remains that despite being inducted into the armed forces since the early-1990s, women officers (they are not inducted in lower ranks) currently number just 1,561 in Army, 1,610 in IAF and 550 in Navy in the 65,000-strong officer cadre in the over 14-lakh armed forces.

Though Delhi government has ordered the closing only of gyms, spas, cinema halls and nightclubs, restaurateurs told TOI that they could not risk the health of their guests and staff and had, therefore, taken a call to shut their outlets.Priyank Sukhija of multi-brand First Fiddle Restaurants was clear that at a time like this, restaurant owners needed to put their staff and clients over business. “In the wake of the havoc caused by the novel coronavirus, we can’t deny the fact that restaurants are places where social distancing can’t be implemented,” he said. “We are shutting down all our restaurants across India till March 31 and we will be back with a bang once the Covid-19 threat ebbs.”Echoing similar sentiments, Inderjeet Singh Banga, Gurgaon chapter head of National Restaurants Association of India and promoter of Prankster and Pirates of Grill eateries, stated, “The World Health Organization has declared Covid-19 a pandemic and since the virus spreads easily, closure has to be effected for the safety of our staff members and our guests.”Dinesh Arora, founder of Eastman Color Restaurants, also felt it was time to take some stern steps to prevent patrons and staff from being infected. “The hospitality industry usually sacrifices almost everything to serve everyone. But it is facing this challenging situation, and safety is uppermost in our concerns,” he asserted. Arora urged people to refrain from socialising during this period.The central and state governments understand the gravity of the emergency and the least the restaurants could do to boost the fight against the coronavirus was to shut their outlets and, thus, prevent gatherings, said Akshay Anand of Ophelia and Toy Room. Along with Anand, Riyaaz Amlani of Impresario Handmade Restaurants too has decided to down shutters till the situation improved. He said he had more than 50 employees in his outlets and keeping the restaurants open would mean violating the Delhi government directive limiting any gathering to 50 people.While these restaurant owners have taken a voluntary decision to close their popular eateries, Sukhija urged the state government to take steps to ask the open outlets to follow suit so that Delhi could collectively fight the coronavirus infection before the situation got of hand.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74682627,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-605869,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-restaurants-down-shutters-for-the-month/articleshow/74682621.cms

452,['18/03/2020'],SC rules in favour of permanent commission for women in Navy,"NEW DELHI: Demolishing the Centre’s opposition to granting permanent commission to women naval officers in all cadres as “premised on sex stereotypes”, the SC on Tuesday quashed the government’s decision to restrict it to only specified branches, stressing on the need to overcome all such discrimination.

Exactly a month after SC passed a landmark verdict allowing command posting and permanent commission (PC) to women officers in Army , a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Ajay Rastogi said gender discrimination cannot be allowed in the Navy on the “illusory” ground that male officers are more suited for certain duties by virtue of their physiological characteristics.

The court said engagement of women in the Navy had been lifted to the extent envisaged in the Centre’s notification of 1991 and 1998 and service of SSC officers, including women in regard to the grant of PCs is to governed by Regulation 203 which did not discriminate on the basis of gender. It brushed aside the contentions of the Centre that sailing in the Indian Navy is not a proper avocation for women and there were practical difficulties in granting PC to women officers due to various reasons, including absence of toilet facilities in certain class of ships, especially those of Russian origin.

“The battle for gender equality is about confronting the battles of the mind. History is replete with examples where women have been denied their just entitlements under law and the right to fair and equal treatment in workplace. In the context of Armed Forces , specious reasons have been advanced by decision-makers and administrators. They range from physiology, motherhood and physical attributes to the male-dominated hierarchies. A hundred and one excuses are no answer to the constitutional entitlement to dignity, which attaches to every individual irrespective of gender, to fair and equal conditions of work and to a level playing field,” the bench said.

The court said women officers have worked shoulder-to-shoulder with their male counterparts and a level playing field must be ensured to allow them to overcome “histories of discrimination” based on their competence, ability and performance. It said a officer should be judged on the basis of one’s competence and dedication and not on gender.

The court also set aside the Centre’s 2008 decision to deny permanent commission to serving women officers at that time by making it prospective. It directed that all the serving women officers shall be given PC on par with male officers and those who left the force because of not getting PC shall be given pensionary benefits.

It also directed the Centre to grant additional compensation of Rs 25 lakh to five women officers each who won the legal battle in the Delhi HC for PC but could not be reinstated because of pendency of the case in the apex court .

Bernie Sanders, whose early strength has evaporated as African Americans and working-class whites across the country have sided with Biden.But Tuesday's primaries demonstrated the tremendous uncertainty confronting the Democratic contest as it collides with efforts to slow the spread of the virus that have shut down large swaths of American life. Polls were shuttered in Ohio even as voting moved forward in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, where some voters and elections officials reported problems.It marked the third week in a row Biden began piling up wins after his victory in South Carolina last month revived his once-flagging campaign. Since then, most of his party's establishment lined up behind him as the best option to unseat President Donald Trump in November.As many people work from home and as schools and businesses close, the primary has remained in limbo, devoid of in-person rallies. Sanders' pathway to the nomination has dramatically narrowed, but he isn't expected to leave the race betting that the national political landscape will look different as the virus continues to reshape life across the country.Sanders has staged virtual rallies that his campaign says have been watched by millions, and he used the coronavirus outbreak to promote the need for universal, government-funded health care under ""Medicare for All,"" his signature issue. Biden's campaign is also taking nothing for granted, even though the former vice president has declared that he'd select a woman as his running mate -- suggesting that such preparations for his clinching the nomination may be underway.Officials in Ohio took the unprecedented step of closing polls Monday, mere hours before they were set to open, pushing back the state's primary until June. Turnout was expected to be affected in Illinois, Florida and Arizona, which went ahead with voting even as federal authorities urged people to stay home whenever possible and not to gather in groups of larger than 10. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez blasted Ohio for breeding ""more chaos and confusion."" He sought to head off more states taking similar actions, urging those with upcoming primaries to expand vote-by-mail and absentee balloting, as well as polling station hours, so that efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus don't further derail his party's nomination contest.""The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt,"" Perez said in a statement.Four other states Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky and Maryland have already moved to push back their primaries, and others could follow suit. That has left the Democratic primary calendar empty until March 29, when Puerto Rico is scheduled to go to the polls -- but island leaders are working to reschedule balloting there, too.Voting on Tuesday saw problems pop up across the country, meanwhile. In Okaloosa County in Florida's Panhandle, two dozen poll workers dropped out, leaving Elections Supervisor Paul Lux's staff scrambling to train replacements.""We are at the honest end of the rope,"" Lux said.The coronavirus has cast a shadow over the Democratic primary race as debates over policy minutiae have taken a back seat to issues of life and death.""It's definitely eerie,"" said Jesse Lehrich, a Democratic operative and former Hillary Clinton campaign spokesman who is based in Chicago, who added, ""Biden and Sanders are debating the merits of marginally different policies in this little pseudo-reality, while America is consumed by an unprecedented crisis.""Millions of voters have already participated in some form of early voting. But there were signs on Tuesday that voters and poll workers were staying home.

Pritzker countered that state law doesn't give him the authority to make the sweeping changes that elections officials wanted.""Let me tell you this: It is exactly in times like these when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else.

""Bangabandhu was absolutely clear that hatred and negativity could never be the foundation of any country's development. But Bangabandhu 's ideas and efforts were not liked by some people who snatched him away from us,"" said Modi who was slated to be the keynote speaker at the function before his visit was cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak.

“We are all witnessing how making terror and violence weapons of politics and diplomacy destroys a society and nation. The world is also watching where the supporters of terror and violence are currently placed and in what state they are, while Bangladesh is scaling new heights,” he said in obvious reference to Pakistan and the terror outfits based in that country.

Describing Bangladesh as India’s “closest” trading and development partner, Modi said the cooperation between the two countries had grown in a number of connectivity-enhancing sectors, such as electricity distribution, the Friendship Pipeline, road, rail, internet, airways and waterways, which connect people from both countries.

The PM stressed that in the past years, India and Bangladesh have “scripted a golden chapter of bilateral ties and given new dimension and direction to our partnership. This is because of increasing trust between the two countries that we have been able to amicably resolve complex issues like land boundary and maritime boundary”.

Modi’s speech was seemingly intended as a balm to many Bangladeshi groups who have protested against India’s new citizenship law and the recent riots in Delhi.

Ever since his no-holds-barred performance in Arjun Reddy, Vijay Deverakonda has been hitting the headlines for his style statements. And in the last 12 months, he has only gotten bigger and better. So, as the list of ‘ Hyderabad Times 30 Most Desirable Men 2019’ is officially unveiled, it’s no surprise that Vijay has been voted as the winner, for the second consecutive year. The list boasts of men under 40 across various fields and the ranking is based on votes cast in an online poll https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ entertainment/times-poll-2019), along with inputs from our internal jury.Having just entered his 30s, Vijay oozes hotness. with his noteworthy performance in Dear Comrade last year, he’s upped the bar as an actor as well. His quick wit, affable charm and bold fashion statements have won him pan-India appeal and with his Bollywood debut in the making, Vijay is now unstoppable. When we catch hold of the actor for his reaction on becoming the Hyderabad Times Most Desirable man 2019 , he unabashedly tells us that he’s bound to win the poll next year as well.Vijay Deverakonda is obsessed with everything he does. And Tollywood is obsessed with this Hyderabadi boy. His quirky sense of style has been making headlines since his Arjun Reddy days and his co-stars — be it Ananya Panday or Shalini Pandey — can’t stop gushing about him. With his rowdy swagger, a sexy Telangana drawl and classic good looks, he has made us fall in love with each of the characters he has portrayed on the silver screen. And the ones who hate him too, constantly have him on their minds because he’s always making news, be it for his quirky fashion sense, for selfies with Bollywood A-listers, a la the welcome party K Jo hosted for Katy Perry when she was in India, or for playing ‘#DevaraSanta’ who grants wishes of his fans during Christmas season. That explains why this man has been voted ‘Hyderabad Times Most Desirable Man 2019’. What’s more he’s unabashed enough to say he “will win the title next year as well.” Excerpts:I have no secret. I’m one of them — a regular boy breaking through and becoming whoever he wants to be. And I think that’s why they connect with me. But we need to ask the people to understand better. Even I am curious to know why I’ve been voted the Most Desirable Man. But all that aside, I feel loved. It feels nice to know that people love me so much.I said what I felt at that moment. I actually believe in, ‘Respect all, fear none’. No one should ever stop you from saying what you feel or being the way you want to be. Live life the way you want to. I think that is where it all comes from.Unto death, I shall be. I am very sure that next year, I am going to be the ‘Most Desirable Man’ again. All these years, I have never really worked out or hit the gym seriously. But now, I am doing a film, which needs me to be in shape. To answer your question, I don’t really think I am cocky.Yeah, I like that word. I am comfortable...Looks are important to me when it comes to desirability because that’s the first thing you notice in a person. I don’t have to talk to you or hear your voice. When I look at you from a distance, I must feel a sense of attraction. That’s one aspect. Having said that, talented people seem extremely attractive to me. When I see a woman who can dance well or hear a singer with an amazing voice, I feel a sense of attraction. I think people being good at what they do is a really attractive trait.I am human and I know it isn’t humanly possible to be aware of everything and be the best at everything. If all of us were good at everything, we would all be clones. Our flaws, talents, all add up to make us who we are, and that’s what gives us the edge each one of us has over the other. If we were all alike, talking and behaving the same way, the world would be such a boring place. Why do we need to have the same personality anyway? So that it is convenient for the world? Look, I just know that I know what I know and I don’t know what I don’t know. If I want to learn it, I will. If I don’t care, I’ll let it pass. As far as clothes are concerned, if I feel like wearing something, I don’t care what anyone thinks, I will wear it. I live a lot for myself; I think I owe it to myself. My mood defines my sense of style. There are days when I feel like wearing a lungi and there is no logic to it. Someone inside me is craving a lungi and I give him that.When you ask me questions like these, then I start thinking — ‘Oh, what’s happening? How did we get here?’. But on an everyday basis, if someone didn’t sit with me and ask me this question, I wouldn’t think about these things. There is so much that I need to get done and so many things I want to do. I don’t think about past glories or compliments because I am eager to show myself and the world what all is possible. I am always on the hunt.I wouldn’t woo like any of the characters from any of my films. It all depends on the person, where I meet her and so many other things. For me, it’s more about friendship. I need to like hanging out with this woman, I need to like her smile, be able to laugh with her and enjoy spending time with her. She also needs to be smart and pretty.No comments. Even if I was in a relationship, I would definitely keep it a secret. What is the point of telling these things? It is no one’s business. I would tell my parents and my friends too. I will reveal it to the world as well, when it happens, but there is time for it. I don’t want my life to become entertainment.I don’t do dates. I guess I am not big on romance... (After a long pause) For me, a perfect date is being with the right person, someone you really like. We could be sitting in my bedroom, enjoying a movie at the theatre or sitting in a flight and it would be perfect.Love can’t be expressed in words, you just feel it. I’ve been through phases where I thought love was bull***t; where I believed it to be a gimmick to sell greeting cards. But now, I believe in love and its existence, but I still don’t know how to define it. It is dynamic in nature and there are no rules to love. It is constantly changing. I find it hard to define it because I can challenge every defintion of love. I feel when you try and define it, it somehow fails.I enjoy the bachelor life, but I know there will come a day when I will want to be a family man. I want everything, so I think I will want that too. There is something very fulfilling about family. It’s beautiful to have your own people, your own kids and watch them grow.I am eager to work with Kiara Advani and Janhvi Kapoor. But I will work with anybody as long as she is a good actress and looks the part. You give me anybody from any industry and I wouldn’t mind.I smile, wave and go. If I don’t want to be clicked, I will tell them to leave me alone. To be honest, when I am not promoting a film or shooting for one, I live a very quiet life. You will not see me anywhere.Making history or doing something memorable. There is no plan and I don’t have it all mapped out. The only thing I know right now is, I am doing Fighter. To be honest, I never thought that I will get here. When I did Pelli Choopulu, I thought to myself, if this works, I will make one more film in the same budget. But ambition is endless, one constantly wants to grow and push limits.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74676451,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-78884/74676451.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/telugu/movies/news/hyderabad-times-most-desirable-man-2019-vijay-deverakonda/articleshow/74676451.cms

The undergraduate student at a top-tier UK university took an Emirates flight from London to Kolkata via Dubai. He had been to a birthday party in Cambridge, where three of his friends were later found to be Covid-19-positive, officials here said.Officials said the teenager and five persons who came in close contact with him — his parents, their driver, an attendant and a neighbourhood doctor — were all in isolation at the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Beliaghata.The family stays in an upscale residential complex off EM Bypass.Unconfirmed reports from state government headquarters Nabanna suggested that the bureaucrat had been to office on Monday. Officials said they were in the process of ascertaining how many more people might have come in touch with the teenager and his immediate family, including his bureaucrat mom.“We have identified five persons who came in direct contact with him in Kolkata and all of them have been kept in the isolation ward. We are waiting for the test results of these five persons,” Bengal director of health services Ajay Chakraborty said. “We will now retrace every person who were in contact with the family and put them in isolation,” another senior health department official said. Virologist Amitabha Nandi said this was the right approach. “It is crucial to track people who came in contact with the teenager,” he said.“The family claimed they learnt only on Tuesday morning that three friends, with whom he had been to a party, had tested positive for Covid-19. They then brought the boy to the hospital,” a health department official said. “The boy had also complained of sore throat and cold, which prompted the family to consult a doctor,” the official added.The teenager was found to be asymptomatic after he landed at the Kolkata airport and was allowed to go home after being advised home isolation for a fortnight. His family claimed he stayed home on Sunday and did not venture out on Monday either.“But we have still asked the family to inform the state health department of every person who may have come in touch with the teenager or his immediate family,” an official said, adding that some relatives had come to the Beliaghata hospital to enquire about his condition. “We are trying to trace everyone,” a senior health department official added.Another official said all protocols were being followed. “The teenager has been kept in a separate Covid-19-positive ward,” he added.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74684158,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-122203,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-on-covid-19-map-teen-back-from-uk-tests-positive/articleshow/74682249.cms

KOLKATA: For the first time in Tollywood, a docu-feature is being made on the Sainbari massacre that shook Bengal on March 17, 1970.

Directed by Sanghamitra Chaudhuri, Sainbari Hatyakando has tracked a surviving member of the Sain family and is re-enacting the incident where the matriarch was forced to eat rice stained with her sons’ blood.

“It’s been 50 years and there is still no headway in one of the bloodiest chapters of Bengal. I want to remind the people of Bengal about this forgotten history,” Chaudhuri said:

Bijoy Sain, a survivor of the family, said: “I was in Class VII or VIII. I was also hit on the head and hospitalised for one and a half months. We lived in a rented house. Subsequently, we ret-urned to our old para and stay in a flat there,” he said.

His voice is frail but the memories are fresh. The ancestral house where the incident occurred is dilapidated. Sometimes, when curious onlookers request him, Bijoy takes them on a trip to the ruins. “When people request to see the house, I accompany them even if it is painful to revisit the past. We were five brothers. Only two of us survived. Even my mother didn’t survive long after the incident,” he said.

A month and a half ago, the director went to shoot on real locations. “It is chilling to hear him narrate the whole incident about how his two brothers were brutally murdered. The eldest brother had his eyes gouged out and acid poured on them. He was later beheaded. Even the tutor wasn’t spared. Shivers ran down my spine when Bijoy showed the kitchen where his mother was served rice stained with his brothers’ blood,” Chaudhuri said.

Parts of the docu-feature show the dilapidated house that is now a den of snakes, mosquitoes and rodents. Bijoy’s interview has been punctuated by a recreation of the events in today’s times.

“He brought out photos from his family albums. There is one of his mother Mriganayani Devi (the matriar-ch). The picture has her sitting in front of photos of her three slain sons. Along with other clippings, we will use this photograph,” she added.

A building that looks somewhat similar to this dilapidated house was located in Behala to shoot the re-enactment scenes.

466,['18/03/2020'],"Coronavirus scare: In Kolkata, ‘Gaumutra’ lands cop in hospital; local BJP organiser behind bars","The shelter at Nimtala where the cow worship was organised on Monday.

KOLKATA: A 34-year-old home guard, who had his first sip of cow urine in a north Kolkata neighbourhood on Monday, was admitted to hospital on Tuesday after he complained of vomiting and nausea. But Pintu Pramanik did not let that come in the way of his duty. He filed a complaint from his hospital bed against the BJP functionary who “induced” him to drink the gaumutra — as “prasad and preventive medicine” against Covid-19 — following which cops arrested Narayan Chatterjee on Tuesday.

The hospitalisation and the arrest capped a bizarre chain of events that played itself out over 22 hours in a neighbourhood a few kilometres northwest of College Street, the cradle of Bengal Renaissance that stamped out social evils like widow-burning from nineteenth-century Calcutta and Bengal.

TOI on Monday reported how Chatterjee, a local BJP member known for his ability to get in TV camera frames, organised a “gaumata” worship programme at an illegal cow shelter near the Nimtala crematorium on the eastern bank of the Hooghly. He then made several bystanders drink cow urine as “protection against the novel coronavirus (nCoV)”; one of them happened to be Pramanik.

TOI has a video where Chatterjee is heard explaining to Pramanik that there was no medicine for nCoV but cow urine could “cure the infection 100%”. Pramanik’s complaint left out most of these details, only mentioning that “unknown persons” had made him drink the cow urine after telling him that it was “charanamrita” (holy water) and that he took ill a few hours after drinking it.

“The incident happened around 2.20 p.m. on Monday when Pramanik was performing traffic duty at the BK Pal Avenue-Nimtala Ghat Street crossing,” a senior Kolkata Police official said. Pramanik’s colleagues said he felt sick and nauseous and vomited twice on Monday evening and so had to be taken to hospital on Tuesday morning; he was “released after treatment” on Tuesday evening.

Cops slapped BJP leader Chatterjee with Sections 269 (“negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life”), 278 (“making the atmosphere noxious to health”) and 114 (“abetment to an offence”) of the Indian Penal Code. Chatterjee can get a prison term of six months if convicted.

TOI visited the khatal (cow shelter) on Baishnab Seth Street on Tuesday and met multiple persons — from milkmen and cabbies to local residents — who drank the urine but said they were doing “fine”. “I was sitting at my shop when Chatterjee and his supporters came and asked me to me drink the gomutra. I had not tasted it before but still agreed because a political leader asked me,” paan shop owner Pradeep Chaurasia said.

A taxi driver, who refused to be named, said he was waiting at the crossing when the BJP leader came up to him with the bottle of gomutra. “There were so many persons with him... I could not refuse. But it tasted strange,” he said.

Ganesh Rai, owner of two of the five cows at the shelter, said he had been working at the same cattle shed for 25 years but had never tasted cow urine before Monday. “It tasted like pepper mixed in water,” he said, making a face.

Suraj Yadav, another elderly milkman who was photographed being fed cow urine from a bottle, said he drank out of fear. “He is a known face here and a powerful man. He came with a lot of people on Monday and did a puja and then made us drink the gomutra he had brought in a bottle,” Yadav said.

TOI tried to trace Chatterjee but calls went unanswered on his cellphone. A neighbour said cops had taken him away for questioning.

“Chatterjee is one of our karyakartas who worked for us in KMC Ward 20 in the 2015 civic polls. But whatever he did on Monday was not an official party programme,” BJP state general secretary Sayantan Ghosh said.

MUMBAI: A special NIA court on Tuesday granted bail to Areeb Majeed , accused of going to Syria to commit acts of terror. The court, however, stayed the order until until March 27, after NIA moved a plea stating it wanted to move an appeal before the Bombay high court.

Majeed (27) was not brought to the court for the hearing. He was arrested on November 28, 2014.

Before the order was stayed, the court had said he was to be released on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh. The court had also directed Majeed to visit the NIA office every week and also asked him to submit the work and residential address of three blood relatives. The court further said that if an arrest warrant was issued against him, he would not get bail again. He was directed to surrender his passport.

In February, the Bombay high court quashed and set aside a September 2019 rejection of his bail plea by the special NIA court. The HC restored the bail plea for a fresh hearing by the trial court after Majeed argued that his submissions of there being a change in circumstance with witnesses turning hostile were not considered.

Majeed argued his pleas before the trial court and the HC in person. He is also cross-examining prosecution witnesses himself.

So far, over 40 witnesses have deposed during the trial. The NIA had arrested Majeed in 2014 over allegations he had left his home on the pretext of a pilgrimage, but he and three others went to Syria to join ISIS to carry out ""jihadi activities"".

The Kalyan youth has been facing trial for ""committing acts of terror"" under Section 16 and criminal conspiracy under Section 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act as well as waging war against nations that have friendly relations with India under Section 125 of the IPC.

The court, while framing charges, had not found evidence to charge him with being an ISIS member..

NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday asked Delhi Police to facilitate the shifting of riot-affected families of northeast Delhi from relief camps to their homes.

The deputy CM also asked the revenue department officials to expedite the compensation process, so the government can move on to next phase of its rehabilitation programme.

With the imposition of ban on political, social, cultural and family gatherings of 50 or people to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading, the government has asked 18 sub-divisional magistrates, who were deployed to speed up the relief and rehabilitation work, to go back to their original postings to enforce the rule with the help of Delhi Police.

In a review meeting with all the stakeholders, Sisodia asked Delhi Police officers to deploy more personnel to ensure that the affected families feel safe while moving back.

""As affected families are all set to head to their homes from relief camps, it is important for us to ensure a safe environment for them. Tighten the security and deploy more police officers in affected areas. This will quell the fear of people living in the relief camps and encourage them to go back to their homes and restart their normal lives,"" Sisodia said, adding that the move will also help the government restore peace in the area.

To keep infiltrators away, Sisodia also demanded the deployment of civil defence personnel at the relief camps.

At least 53 people were killed and nearly 500 injured in the communal violence that had erupted in northeast Delhi in the last week of February. A large number of houses, shops, buildings and vehicles were vandalised and set afire in the riots.

Till March 16, Delhi government had disbursed about Rs13.5 crore to 1,215 affected people. About 240 people could not be given the compensation since FIRs were not registered in many cases or there were some disputes in their claims, the government said.

""All irregularities with respect to names of victims should be sorted and disbursement of compensation should be completed by verifying the claims as soon as possible,"" a government statement quoted Sisodia as saying.

The government on Tuesday also decided to consider acid attack as a case of severe injury and give a compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh each to the families of three children who were victims of acid attack in the riots.

In the second phase, the government has decided to shift its focus on long-term rehabilitation of riot victims, which includes psycho-social counselling, peacebuilding and livelihood support.

475,['18/03/2020'],Congress: Assault on the basic structure of Constitution,"NEW DELHI: Congress on Tuesday said the nomination of former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi to Rajya Sabha constitutes a serious assault on the basic structure of the Constitution, alleging it would add to the perception that judiciary is being influenced by the government.

AICC spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said, “Congress finds the nomination of a retired CJI to the RS as one of the most serious, unprecedented and unpardonable assaults on the basic structure of the Constitution, which subsumes independence of judiciary as held by the Supreme Court judgements.”

Anand Sharma, deputy leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, said, “Justice Gogoi's nomination is a reward for compromising the independence of the judiciary and delaying hearing of urgent Constitutional matters to appease the government.”

“By his conduct and actions, he eroded people's faith in the justice system. The present judges have a duty to undo the damage and restore the dignity of judiciary and people's trust,” he added.

The strong words from Congress came amid widespread criticism of Gogoi’s nomination to the RS by the opposition and former judges.

Singhvi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi could have followed the advice of late BJP leader Arun Jaitley who had said that possibility of post-retirement benefits influenced judgements delivered by judges.

The spokesman, who is also a supreme court lawyer, said Gogoi’s appointment will compound the perception that “judiciary in recent years has not been able to stand up with its usual vigour and fearlessness against the executive and legislative onslaught”.

AICC spokesman Randeep Surjewala quoted former SC judge Madan Lokur to ask, “Has the last bastion fallen?”

At the same time, Congress sought to rebuff the “propaganda by BJP” that Congress governments too had nominated former CJIs to the upper House.

Singhvi said Justice Ranganath Mishra was appointed to RS six years after his retirement while M Hidayatullah was appointed as chairman of the Rajya Sabha and vice president nine years after his retirement as Chief Justice of India.

“The dirty tricks department of the ruling party gives completely inapplicable and misleading examples whose only objective is to mislead you,” he said.

NEW DELHI: Claiming the passage of the Central Sanskrit Universities Bill, 2020 as a landmark moment, Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal said it will promote study of India’s ancient and traditional knowledge.

The Bill was passed by Parliament on Monday, according central university status to three ‘deemed’ universities on Sanskrit studies. Speaking to TOI, Pokhriyal said it fulfils a long standing demand of Sanskrit lovers and scholars, as these universities will take the knowledge of Sanskrit language across the world.

The three deemed universities — Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan( New Delhi); Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth (New Delhi); and Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth (Tirupati)— will now get the status of central university. Lok Sabha had already passed the Bill on December 12.

Stating that Sanskrit is a scientific language and a language of wisdom which is also being taught in some top universities of the world, the minister said: “While the whole world is gaining from our ancient knowledge, we seem to be lagging behind.” In India, there are more than 5 crore students of Sanskrit, he said.

“If we just look at Germany, Sanskrit is being taught in 14 universities. Indians and especially Sanskrit scholars here would be happy to know the long list of countries where Sanskrit is being studied today – Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Britain, Netherlands , Italy, Russia, Sweden, Japan, America, Bhutan, Indonesia , Mauritius, China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia among others. Harvard University has one of the biggest Sanskrit centres, while it’s worth a visit to the Sanskrit centre at Cambridge ... if we innovate and research on our ancient knowledge and repository and link these to modern science, India again will be ‘viswa guru’,” he said.

He said Sanskrit is a gift of India for the entire humanity. “Sanskrit is not only a language but an identity of the great cultural diversity of this country ... Due to these factors, it has become imperative to promote the study and research in Sanskrit language.”

MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray said on Tuesday that if, despite appeals to the public to avoid non-essential travel, crowds in trains and buses do not lessen, the state would be forced to take the stern decision of stopping trains and bus services.

Thackeray said state government offices would be run with minimum staff strength. Modalities of how this would be done were being worked out and a final decision would be taken in two days, he noted. The state has already directed private offices to work at 50% attendance and held meetings with heads of large companies, asking them to have as few employees as possible in their offices.

“We are not shutting down buses and trains as of now. We are appealing to people to avoid non-essential travel, but if people don’t exercise restraint, we will be forced to shut them down,” the CM said after a cabinet meeting.

There had been a scare in Mantralaya on Monday when an employee showed symptoms of coronavirus. Though he tested negative at Kasturba hospital, in the wake of the incident there had been a demand from state employees to shut Mantralaya.

The CM said government offices doing non-essential work would be asked to function with minimum staff and non-important work pushed back so staff did not have to travel to office. Thackeray said non-essential shops such as those of garments or jewellery should voluntarily shut.

Sources said in the cabinet, some ministers were of the view that trains and buses should be stopped to ensure people stay indoors. But some senior bureaucrats opposed the idea and said this would lead to panic and many essential services would be hit. “Many people use trains for commute to hospital or for other essential activities. Also, vegetables are transported by train in many parts of the city. A lot of things will be impacted,” a senior official said. He said the state should rather focus on ensuring the private sector complies with its work-from-home order Both CR and WR will take a call on Wednesday on whether to run their AC locals.

The government feels restrictions on entry announced since February 26, along with rigorous contact tracing, have helped limit virus transmission.To ascertain whether there is a risk of community transmission, the government is waiting for ICMR to test over 1,000 randomly collected samples of people suffering from severe acute respiratory infection such as pneumonia without having a travel history or contact. The results are expected on Wednesday. The government maintained there is only limited localised transmission and there is no need to panic.Meanwhile, the government also issued guidelines for tests to be conducted by private laboratories. A laboratory test should be only offered such tests when prescribed by a qualified physician as per ICMR guidance. “Since the guidance evolves periodically, the latest revised version should be followed,” said joint secretary in the health ministry Lav Agarwal.ICMR will share SOPs for laboratory testing and provide positive controls for establishing the test as soon as the private laboratory concerned has procured the primers, probes and reagents. Adoption of commercial kits for testing should be based on validations conducted by ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, Agarwal said.“In the wake of the prevailing Covid-19 situation and in order to strengthen the containment measures, it is of utmost importance that each and every case (suspects/confirmed) of Covid-19 is isolated and provided appropriate treatment and their contacts are traced at the earliest to break the chain of transmission. It is important that support and cooperation of private sector is enlisted in this regard,” the government said.Experts say most cases of Covid-19 are mild and selflimiting. According to the World Health Organisation , only 20% patients progress to severe and critical illness and require supportive care interventions, such as oxygen and ventilation.Officials said the readiness was based on risk assessment taking into account age, travel history, contact tracing and co-morbidities of samples which have been collected so far. With 137 positive cases so far, over 5,700 people who have come in contact are under surveillance. Besides, 69,436 people are under community surveillance.Guidelines on dead body management, precautions, infection control and environmental cleaning and disinfection were also released.

The new system will come into effect from April.

Earlier, there have been only four authorised parking zones in Salt Lake.

Some of the important stretches, which have been freshly identified as fee parking zones are from Tank No. 13 to Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan via the middle road of Saurav Abasan and Falguni Abason, the stretch from Vivekananda Statue to City Centre Island along the boundary wall of the urban development department stack yard, both sides from Baisakhi Island to Tank No.8 and both sides from GD Island to Anindita and Labony Island.

Front gates of all schools will be considered as no parking zones and no vehicle will be allowed in front of school gates. Only 15 minutes will be given for picking up and dropping students at the school gates.

All 13 fee parking zones have been finalized in consultation with the Bidhannagar traffic police. The parking zones may be temporarily suspended or the zones may be relaid in public interest during important events like the Pujas or melas.

The authorities have also fixed the rate of parking fees. The parking fee for four wheelers will be Rs 20 for the first hour and Rs 15 thereafter for each hour. For two wheelers, the rate will be Rs 10 for the first hour and Rs 5 thereafter for each hours.

There have been several complaints from many residents that parking agents illegally collect fees from some places, which are not listed as fee parking zones.

485,['18/03/2020'],5 lesser-known facts about butt aesthetics that people are too shy to ask,"Men or women, everyone has multiple questions related to different parts of their body. Some are worried about their skin while others stress about their continuous hair fall. But there is one part of the body, which most people do not talk about. Yes, we are talking about your butt.Big, small, round or not-so-round, nobody can resist looking at their butt. Whether you are in the shower or standing in front of the mirror, it is hard to not look at your lower back. People generally have a plethora of questions regarding the appearance of their butt, but the irony is everyone is just too shy to ask. Well, today we will tell you 5 lesser-known facts about your butt that you should know.You might have always wondered - am I the only one who has butt hair? The answer is no. Butt hair is a normal phenomenon. Every person has it, except for the one suffering from alopecia. Most people have hair on the cheeks, around the anus, or both. Moreover, butt hair has some special purpose. It prevents chafing between the butt cheeks and also traps our unique scent.Not all parts of your body have the same skin tone. It gets darker or lighter on several parts. The same is with butts. Due to the higher concentration of melanocytes (the cells producing melanin) in the skin folds, our butts appear darker as compared to other parts of the body. For the same reason, the skin of our armpits, elbows and the backs of your knees appear darker.There is no need to worry if you have small bumps on your butt cheek- it is normal. The bumps are due to a condition called folliculitis, which develops from friction, sweating or bacteria. We hardly pay attention to our skin below the waist and this is one reason why it looks dry and you experience other skin problems. The best way to prevent acne is by cleansing with a gentle acne wash and moisturising it.Even if you have never exposed your butts to the sunlight, you may still get skin cancer. Skin cancer or melanoma can appear on any part of the body. Even between your fingers, underarms or butt. If you witness any changes in the appearance of your butt or have any mole which is growing rapidly then visit a doctor.Your butt hair is a kind of protective layer, but if you choose to remove it, precaution is necessary. Waxing, shaving and using Nair carelessly, increase the amount of acne on your back. Using any random thing on your back to remove the hair can disrupt the follicle and even cause injury.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74675667,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-871070/74675667.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/fitness/5-lesser-known-facts-about-butt-aesthetics-that-people-are-too-shy-to-ask/articleshow/74675667.cms

MUMBAI: The Mumbai police on Tuesday ordered the closure of pubs, bars and discotheques till March 31. “Dance bars and drinking joints are places that are overcrowded and have very little breathing space, increasing the possibility of contracting coronavirus among patrons. Hence, we have asked all establishments to shut down operations till the end of this month,” said deputy police commissioner Pranay Ashok. Those not following the directive will face action, he said.

Meanwhile, the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), which represents over 1 lakh players in the country, issued an advisory recommending temporary closure of restaurants from Wednesday. Around three dozen restaurants, including Bombay Canteen, The Table, Flying Saucer and Indigo, have decided to adhere to the recommendations amid the government increasingly stressing on the importance of social distancing as part of its efforts to combat the spread of Covid-19.

The restaurant industry has been seeing a drop of over 30 per cent in business with “footfalls dropping every hour” at some eateries.

The Rs 4 lakh crore restaurant industry has been hit after the government banned tourist visas and directed the shuttering of outlets in malls in some cities.

While the NRAI has recommended closure of venues till March 31 or “till such a time when no new coronavirus cases are reported”, it has left the decision to the proprietors. “This (recommendation of shutting down of operations) will result in a significant financial strain on the sector, but in view of the serious health risk to lakhs of employees and millions of patrons amid the worsening Covid-19 situation in the country, we have gone ahead with the advisory,” said NRAI president Anurag Katriar.

Meanwhile, to ensure that all pubs, bars and discotheques in the city remain shut till March 31, Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh has asked zonal DCPs to keep strict vigil in their areas.

Since there is no clarity when normalcy would be restored, the food services sector, which has high fixed operating costs, is staring at losses and potential job cuts. The industry is seeking financial relief from the government and support from other stakeholders to battle the crisis amid the economic slowdown.

“This is an extraordinary situation and beyond our control. Supports like converting fixed rentals to variable revenue share, moratorium on loan repayment, and deferred payment of permit room renewal licence fee will go a long way in curtailing astronomical losses,” said Katriar.

“Footfalls are dropping every hour, every minute at our standalone outlets,” Anjan Chatterjee, CEO of Speciality Restaurants, India’s largest chain of fine-dining brands, told TOI before the NRAI advisory was issued.

And customers who turn up at the eating joints are staying off from meat dishes because of the Covid-19 scare. “There has been a serious impact on the sale of non-vegetarian dishes and those containing eggs. People are playing safe by choosing muesli and other cereals and vegetarian dishes,” said Gudiya Chadha, founder, All Elements Cafe.

A key initiative, according to sources, is that around 15,000 hectares of government-owned land in both Jammu and Kashmir regions may be offered to industrialists to set up new facilities that will not only boost economic activity but also generate employment for locals.

The interaction, also attended by minister of state for PMO Jitendra Singh , was held at the request of the members of various industry associations and business chambers in the UT of J&K. It comes ahead of impending notification of a domicile policy for the UT as well launch of an attractive industrial policy aimed at bringing into J&K three times the investment by 2024, than what had came over the past 70 years.

A government functionary said land plots spread over 15,000 hectares across Jammu region as well as Kashmir region had been identified for outside investors wanting to set up shop in J&K. “Industrialists prefer to buy government land rather than private land to avoid any hassles. While this will also limit transfer of ownership of private land, industrial/corporate houses will automatically be exempt from the domicile condition in case they wish to purchase private land for setting up a unit,” the functionary told TOI.

At the meeting with Shah and Sitharaman on Tuesday, J&K representatives from all sectors like trade, tourism, transport, handicrafts, agriculture, horticulture, commerce and industry, are said to have demanded restructuring of loans or waivers to ensure ease of business in J&K. They are said to have sought solutions beyond the RBI guidelines to create incentives for business in J&K.

492,['18/03/2020'],Using Bluetooth phone while driving no offence,"NEW DELHI: Use of bluetooth for communication while driving and talking through a fixed phone on dashboard won’t be treated as a violation of Motor Vehicle Act norms. The road transport ministry is also likely to bring more clarity on the provision defining “use of hand-held device” while driving as more and more states/ UTs notify the specific fine for the offence.

The Delhi government last week fixed Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 fine for first and second offence for using “hand-held phone” while driving. Sources said representatives from Delhi Police had recently taken up the need to explain this provision in detail with the road transport ministry so that there is no ambiguity in the implementation of this provision.

However, road safety experts said drivers should avoid using phones in any form while driving since it distracts attention and is increasingly proving to be more fatal for drivers as also pedestrians.

Even countries like the United States have witnessed high number of deaths due to distracted driving, which claimed 2,841 lives in 2018 alone. Among those killed were 1,730 drivers, 605 passengers, 400 pedestrians and 77 bicyclists. Its highway safety agency, NHTSA even carried out an intensive campaign of “U Drive U Text U Pay” to crackdown on distracted driving.

493,['18/03/2020'],J&amp;K reference in China-Pak statement annoys India,"NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday strongly rejected the reference to Jammu and Kashmir in the joint statement issued by China and Pakistan after the recent visit of Pakistani President Arif Alvi to China, reiterating that the UT was an integral part of India.

The government also asked China not to comment on India's internal matter and to respect India's sovereignty. ""We expect other countries, including China, not to comment on matters that are internal affairs of India and also to respect India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity just as India refrains from commenting on internal issues of other countries,"" MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said.

On the other hand, he said, India would like to strongly object to and reiterate its concerns to both China and Pakistan on the projects in so-called illegal “China Pakistan Economic Corridor”, which is in the territory of India that has been illegally occupied by Pakistan since 1947.

""India is resolutely opposed to any actions by other countries to change the status quo in Pakistan-occupied J&K. We call on parties concerned to cease such actions. Such illegal activities will never be accepted by India,"" the official said.

According to Pakistani media reports, China reiterated that the Kashmir issue was a dispute left from history, and should be properly and peacefully resolved based on UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements.

494,['18/03/2020'],Palwal additional district and sessions judge demoted after SC order,"Representative image

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court administration on Tuesday ordered the demotion of Palwal additional district and sessions judge Karuna Sharma to the post of civil judge (junior division) and shifted her to Rewari district courts. The HC administration has taken this decision following the Supreme Court order of February 19 holding that in-service judicial officers are not eligible to be appointed as district judges in superior judicial services of the state against the posts meant for practicing advocates.

Sharma has now been reverted as civil judge (junior division) in Haryana, a much lower post she was holding prior to her direct appointment in Haryana superior judicial services in December 2018 as additional district and sessions judge. Sharma had recently handed down death sentence to a man for raping and killing a 5-year-old girl. Consequent to her demotion, she would no longer have powers to award capital punishment. Her decisions, passed in the capacity of additional district and sessions judge from December 2018 till date, however, would be held legally valid as per the statutory provisions.

Sources said that one more judge posted in Punjab superior judicial services may also be reverted by the HC administration soon.

Officer had moved SC over seniority factor

Making it clear that direct appointment in state’s superior judicial services should be exclusively from practicing lawyers, SC observed that the Constitution-makers consciously wished that bar members should be considered for appointment at all three levels -- district judges, HCs, and SC.

SC’s three-judge bench passed these orders while hearing bunched petitions of Dheeraj Mor and others. Anmol Singh Nayar, a Haryana judicial services officer who is among the petitioners, had challenged the decision of Punjab and Haryana high court administration through which judicial officers were permitted to participate in the selection process of state superior judicial services that is meant for advocates having seven years’ experience as lawyers. His grievance was that this would impact his seniority. He had approached the SC after a division bench of high court had dismissed his plea.
