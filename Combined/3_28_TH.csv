World Athletics president Sebastian Coe admitted on Friday that settling on a new date for the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 will not satisfy everybody.

“All sports have made it pretty clear they have particular challenges at particular times of the year,” said Coe. “We are probably not going to reach a solution that meets with the approval of every sport. But there does have to be an element of flexibility and there is going to be flexibility for the next two years.”

The 2021 World Athletics Championships, for example, are scheduled to be staged in August next year in Eugene, USA.

There is no definite date yet for the rescheduled Olympic Games with IOC chief Thomas Bach saying on Tuesday that the Olympics “must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021”.

There have been suggestions even that the rebooted Olympics could be held in the spring and so allow athletes to avoid competing in the brutal heat and humidity of Japan’s summer.

“There are clearly demands for this decision to be taken as quickly as possible — the athletes and the federations need clarity,” added Coe. “Once the decision is made, we can build (the calendars) around it.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/91ddat/article31194529.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29COE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/new-date-wont-satisfy-everybody-says-coe/article31194530.ece
1,2020/03/28,"Postponed Olympic qualifiers will take place, says Narinder Batra","Batra asks NSFs to share athletes’ training plans

The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Narinder Batra on Saturday said the Tokyo Olympics qualification events, postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, will be held once the health crisis is resolved and asked the National Sports Federations (NSFs) to prepare a list of such tournaments in their respective sports.

Batra also asked the top brass of all the NSFs to share calendar of their athletes’ preparations for the Tokyo Games, pushed back by one year to 2021 in view of the worsening COVID-19 pandemic.

“The qualification events which were postponed will happen again at revised dates once this virus issue is resolved. Draft tentative planning for that. Please share details of all the qualification events yet to happen in your sport,” Batra wrote in a letter to the presidents and secretaries of all the NSFs.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach on Thursday had a conference call with its members in the aftermath of the postponement of the Olympics. Batra is an IOC member as well as the president of the International Hockey Federation.

Batra also said the IOA and NSFs need to plan on the extension of contracts of the coaches whose tenures were to end this year.

“As you are already aware that 2020 Olympics is postponed to 2021. We now need to plan for: Extension of Contracts for HPD (High Performance Director), coaches, support staff, etc. till end of 2021 as many such contracts are ending in 2020, the process needs to start as soon as possible,” the IOA chief said.

Understanding

He added that under the present circumstances, it will be very difficult to give any confirmations “but this is just to get everyone on same page”.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/er7n79/article31194464.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29BATRA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/postponed-olympic-qualifiers-will-take-place-says-narinder-batra/article31194465.ece

Grandmaster P. Harikrishna feels the lockdowns and emergencies across the world may not actually discomfit a chess player, for they prefer isolation anyway!

“But, this kind of isolation is certainly not pleasant, for there is so much uncertainty around the world,” he says.

Sponsors' plight

“And, when it comes to tournaments, I think it will take a lot of time for sponsors to regroup and get back to hosting sporting events once the situation improves,” he says.

“I have learnt that many sponsors, of not just chess, have suffered huge losses. It cannot be said how many of them will recover and how quickly. Sports will be badly hit because of the impact on economy,” said Harikrishna in an exclusive chat with The Hindu from Prague, where he has been staying since 2018 after marrying Nadezda Stojanovic, the Serbian chess prodigy.

“Yes, we have to be optimistic, hopeful of a dramatic improvement of the situation. But, again, not that easy given this coronavirus has hit world economy very badly,” he said.

India’s third highest-rated player, after Viswanathan Anand (2753) and Vidit Gujrati (2726), and former World junior champion also felt it was strange the Candidates matches in Russia was at one time the only sporting event being held, but it was also cancelled subsequently, after seven rounds.

“I felt they should not have even begun it. It was not as if we were expecting things to worsen, but the hints were there. Perhaps, no one understood fully the gravity of the situation,” he reasoned.

“The fact is there were two Chinese players in the Candidates matches and their families too would have been worried about the developing situation,” Harikrishna said.

New experience

But, the Candidates also presented the 33-year-old Hyderabadi a first-time experience — commentating for a website.

“At the last World championship I had done commentary, but it was more of a summary of the day’s play. Here, I had to pick the game of the day and make an in-depth analysis. Honestly, I enjoyed it thoroughly,” the World No. 27 said.

“I am in touch with my game thanks to the technology available and my wife’s company (she being a chess player). But, frankly, this is not the time to think of tournaments. Sport is secondary when the whole world is battling for survival.

The five-time World champion’s travel plans went haywire following the outbreak of the coronavirus. He had travelled to Germany to play in the Bundesliga chess.

Though he wasn’t playing, Anand had been kept busy by chess. He made his debut as a commentator during the Candidates chess tournament, the only high-profile sporting event taking place anywhere in the world till it was stopped on Thursday at the half-way mark at Yekaterinburg, as Russia decided to ground international flights.

In this exclusive interview, Anand tells The Hindu whether FIDE was right in going ahead with the Candidates (the tournament that will determine Magnus Carlsen’s challenger for the next World championship). He also spoke about life in Europe in the time of coronavirus, India’s response to the pandemic and the quality of chess on display at Yekaterinburg. Excerpts:

How is life in Germany, and the rest of Europe, in these hard times?

Here, everyone more or less maintains a certain social distance. You know, when you walk on street, if somebody comes across, you step aside so that you are at least a metre away. I feel they are dealing with the worst of infections now, at least statistics suggest that. They are holding up well. I have not seen anyone complain.

It is tough, but statistics are quite promising for Germany, with the caveat, of course, that nobody really knows how the disease evolves. This is a situation unlike anything we have faced before.

How do you spend your time at Frankfurt?

I block some time during the day for exercise. Before it gets too late in India, I check up on my wife Aruna and son Akhil through phone or video calls.

Do you think they did the right thing by going ahead with the Candidates as per schedule?

Yes. With hindsight, it looks questionable. But when they decided to go ahead with it, everything wasn't as clear as it is now. I feel globally the consensus on stopping everything and focusing on virus became evident only a week before the Candidates started. By the time many of the participants were in Yekaterinburg.

How did you find the experience of being a commentator?

I enjoyed it. I tried to approach like a chess fan and not as a former participant myself. I wanted to try and enjoy watching the experience of the strong players competing for the right to play in the World championship.

What do you think about the quality of chess at Yekaterinburg?

I feel it has been consistently high. There have been very few games that were decided by crass blunders. There have been lots of interesting, original ideas. And it was gripping stuff to watch. I think, in a way, it is curious that the participant who came late, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, is actually leading the tournament (along with Ian Nepomniachtchi).

Your thoughts on the impact of the virus on chess and other sports...

It looks like chess and the rest of the sports world would have to deal with a lot of cancellations.

I am really curious not only about sports but how the global economy is going to recover. We are so used to operating all the time that this year is going to be drastically different.

On how India has tackled the situation...

I think India has responded well. Clearly social distancing and lockdowns are the norm everywhere. Most countries are doing it. But we should understand that given the size of our country, this is necessary even though at the moment we don’t really know how bad the situation is or might be.

I feel the Indians have taken this generally well.

I am sure the government is working to procure all the equipment necessary.

Most of us like to socialise and be with friends.

That’s exactly the behaviour which can spread this.

So, we will have to practise isolation till the danger passes.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/nj4o09/article31186295.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28ANAND,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/viswanathan-anand-curious-about-how-sports-and-global-economy-will-recover/article31186296.ece

Italy’s death toll from COVID-19 shot past 10,000 on Saturday with 889 new deaths, the country’s Civil Protection Service said.

The new fatalities reported in the world's worst-hit nation came a day after it registered 969 deaths on Friday ⁠— the highest single toll since the COVID-19 virus emerged late last year.

Italy now looks certain to extend its economically debilitating ⁠— and emotionally stressful ⁠— business closures and the ban on public gatherings past their April 3 deadline.

“Is it time to reopen the country? I think we have to think about it really carefully,” civil protection service chief Angelo Borrelli told reporters. “The country is at a standstill and we must maintain the least amount of activity possible to ensure the survival of all.”

Italians had begun to hope that their worst disaster in generations was easing after the increase in daily death rates began to slow on March 22.

But the new surge has changed the Mediterranean nation's mood.

Also read: Silent spread of novel coronavirus in Italy went undetected for weeks

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told Italians late on Saturday to be ready to spend more time cooped up at home.

“If one is being reasonable, one cannot envision a quick return to normal life,” Mr. Conte said in his latest sombre television address.

Going into debt

The monumental economic toll of fighting the pandemic has triggered a huge row among European leaders about how best to respond.

The southern European nations worst-hit by the virus are urging the EU to go abandon its budget rules.

The bloc has already loosened its purse strings in ways not seen since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.

But PM Conte argues that this is not enough.

France is backing a push by Italy and Spain for the EU to start issuing “corona bonds” ⁠— a form of common debt that governments sell to raise money to address individual economic needs.

Other nations such as Germany and the Netherlands are baulking at the idea of joint debt.

Mr. Conte said he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had “not just a disagreement but a hard a frank confrontation” this week about how to proceed.

“If Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d'etre to the people,” Mr. Conte told Saturday's edition of the Il Sole 24 Ore financial newspaper.

'Critical point in history'

The entire eurozone is expected to slip into a recession over the coming months.

But Italy is facing the threat of a near economic collapse after being the first European country to shutter almost all its businesses on March 12.

Some forecasts suggest that its economy ⁠— the third-largest among nations that use the euro common currency ⁠— could contract by as much as seven percent this year.

It shrank by 5.3% of gross domestic product in 2009.

PM Conte warned that EU leaders were in danger of making “tragic mistakes”.

“I represent a country that is suffering a lot and I cannot afford to procrastinate,” Mr. Conte said.

The energetic 55-year-old has seen his popularity shoot up thanks to a general sense that he has been doing all he could.

A growing number of medics are warning that Italy's fatalities could be much higher because retirement homes often do not report all their COVID-19 deaths.

The number of people who have died from the new disease at home is also unknown.

“This is something very different from the 2008 crisis,” PM Conte warned in the newspaper interview. “We are at a critical point in European history.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/fueq2x/article31195344.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23thmar0001Q75P5jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-italys-toll-becomes-highest-in-world/article31195280.ece
8,2020/03/28,"Coronavirus | Countries report less than 20% of symptomatic cases, says U.K. epidemiologist","U.K. epidemiologist Adam Kucharski says a big challenge in fighting COVID-19 is that a lot of transmission happens very early on in the infection

Professor Adam Kucharski, who is an Associate Professor and the Sir Henry Dale Fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, specialises in the mathematical analysis of infectious disease outbreaks. He spoke to The Hindu about the global coronavirus pandemic, specifically on what nations can learn from models of infectious outbreaks, and even of fake news. Edited excerpts:

In your book, The Rules of Contagion: Why Things Spread – and Why They Stop, you talk about Ronald Ross, a Nobel Prize-winning British doctor who in the late 19th century discovered that mosquitoes spread malaria. How can we apply the blend of mathematics, biology and societal analysis that he did to predict the endgame scenario for the coronavirus pandemic today?

One of the key insights that Ross made was regarding the control of infection. People had this idea that you couldn’t control malaria until you could remove every single last mosquito. Ross used these simple, conceptual models and realised that actually you don’t need to remove every last mosquito. Once you get the density of mosquitos low enough, the chances are that someone who is infected would recover before they pass it on to others.

Global death toll crosses 27,000, over six lakh cases registered in 183 countries

We can think of a similar idea with a lot of the physical distancing measures that are coming in. Initially, there may still be some infectious people out there, but because these measures are in place, they will have the infection and recover before they pass it on to someone else. That’s what we’ve seen in places like Wuhan.

How, in terms of the mathematics of epidemiology, does COVID-19 differ from other major infectious outbreaks such as the Spanish flu, SARS or Ebola?

There are a number of broad principles that we can use to understand these infections. These can apply across a number of pathogens, particularly in understanding the magnitude of spread. So, each person who gets infected, on average, how many people are they giving the virus to? For COVID-19, it is about two or three. We can also think about the time scales: if you have one case, how long on average is it until the person infected then shows symptoms? For COVID-19, that’s about five days or so.

State Helpline numbers | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India | Coronavirus - Live updates

One of the big challenges or differences of COVID-19, as opposed to SARS or Ebola, is that a lot of transmission seems to be happening very early on in the infection, when people don’t have symptoms or have very mild symptoms. One of the reasons why infections like Ebola and SARS have been easier to control is that a lot of people who are highly infectious have very distinctive symptoms.

Also Read | Also Read Coronavirus | Can drugs for Ebola be used to treat COVID-19?

That means you can identify them, look at whom they’ve come in contact with, and make sure those people have been quarantined. However, for COVID-19, a lot of the transmission happens among people who might feel perfectly well, or might have a slight cough, for example. That makes it very hard to pick up all the infections, and is why we’ve seen in many countries, even if they’ve been trying to detect cases coming in, many cases have managed to go undetected.

India has a relatively low number of confirmed cases and correspondingly fewer recorded deaths linked to COVID-19. Given the size and density of our population, does this seem a little suspicious to you?

I think in the early stages, it is quite hard to untangle those two things, when you have a very small number of cases — is it just by chance, or population structure or other features that mean that transmission hasn’t quite taken off yet?

Once we start to get more severe cases, especially deaths, you can then start to get a clearer picture of how much infection you might be seeing. We recently did some rough estimates and we think that many countries that have clear outbreaks now are probably reporting less than 20% of their symptomatic cases.

Do you see any parallels between deadly pandemics such as COVID-19 and how fake news transmission happens?

There certainly are parallels. For COVID-19, on average, in the early stage, each case would give the infection to a couple of others. In a study of viral Facebook content, it was found that each person on average who shares a viral post will lead to about two more people sharing it. But the big difference is the time scale.

Is the global economy headed for recession?

With COVID-19, it takes a few days for that transmission and that new infection to occur whereas online we might be talking about 30 seconds.

Also, for COVID-19, there have been some outbreaks where a single event sparks a large number of secondary infections. A lot of content that becomes popular online tends to have that feature too. We see messages spreading on WhatsApp, but often there will be some high-profile person online, or some media outlet that will have sparked the outbreak and shared with a large number of people. Then you see these smaller but secondary clusters of sharing happening.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ge8345/article31194944.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29-UK-INTERVIEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-countries-report-less-than-20-of-symptomatic-cases-says-uk-epidemiologist/article31194945.ece

12,2020/03/28,Taiwan Foreign Minister invites U.S. scribes expelled by China,"Beijing had revoked their accreditations earlier in March

Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu extended a personal invitation on Saturday for three major U.S. newspapers to station on the island their China-based journalists whose expulsion Beijing has announced.

China said on March 18 it was revoking the press accreditations of all American journalists in the China bureaus of The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, which were due to expire at the end of 2020. Beijing also said those affected would not be allowed to work as journalists in the Chinese-run city of Hong Kong. In the past, foreign journalists kicked out of, or barred from, mainland China were allowed to work in Hong Kong. “As @nytimes, @WSJ & @washingtonpost face intensifying hostility in China, I'd like to welcome you to be stationed in Taiwan — a country that is a beacon of freedom & democracy,” Mr. Wu wrote on Twitter. “Yes! You’ll find people here greeting you with open arms & lots of genuine smiles.”

Taiwan is home to only a small number of permanent foreign correspondents, and none of the three newspapers has a full-time presence on the island currently.

While Chinese-claimed Taiwan is a freewheeling democracy with freedom of expression, it has stepped up controls to help prevent the spread of the virus, and generally only foreigners holding residence permits are currently allowed entry.

China has laid the blame for the situation with the three newspapers at Washington’s door, for first restricting the number of Chinese media in the U.S. Last month, Washington demanded journalists from Chinese state media be registered as staff of diplomatic missions, saying it was a response to the growing crackdown on independent reporting in China.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/t1a3zw/article31194613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Th29-China-Wu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/taiwan-foreign-minister-invites-us-scribes-expelled-by-china/article31194614.ece
13,2020/03/28,Coronavirus | Russia to close borders,"A decree on the government’s website said Russia would “temporarily restrict traffic” across national borders to prevent new infections.

Russia is to completely close its borders from Monday to stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), the government said on Saturday.

A decree on the government’s website said Russia would “temporarily restrict traffic” across national borders to prevent new infections.

The country closed its borders to foreigners last week and grounded all international flights on Thursday as part of increasingly stringent measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Russia. Health officials have registered 1,264 cases and four deaths, according to Saturday’s official tally.

Russian diplomats and truck drivers will be exempted from the new restrictions.

14,2020/03/28,Solidarity from two metres away,"A Sri Lankan editor has started an online journal to collate stories about life during the lockdown

“How did you Kashmiris survive the lockdown for six months?” Almost everyone who met or called Nurat Maqbool after the ‘Janata Curfew’ last Sunday asked her, according to an account she wrote in the ‘Lockdown Journal’, an online platform launched by a Colombo-based editor-writer to record stories of the lockdown worldwide in the time of the COVID-19 crisis.

Kashmiris have seen lockdowns “every other week for the last three decades”. But this one, which she experienced in Bengaluru, was not the same. “The lockdown was there [in Kashmir] but it was for a small area and the rest of the world was happy and thriving. Sometimes all of that gives you hope that things will be better for you as well. But in the lockdown of the world, there is no escape,” she wrote on March 22 in the journal.

The journal [lockdownjournal.com], launched by Sunila Galappatti, went live on March 20, and has over 30 entries so far, including from the U.K., India, Jamaica, Nigeria, Portugal, Germany, Sri Lanka and Australia.

The entries are typically short, first person narratives of a full day. While COVID-19 is the running theme, the stories are both similar and different, depending on who and where the writers are.

Eloghosa Osunde, in Abuja, Nigeria, writes about downloading an app used for group video chats. “It is F’s birthday today,” she wrote on March 25, apparently about a friend in Lagos. They chat about assorted things — like earrings and live concerts. They laugh and Ms. Osunde sleeps well that afternoon. She wakes up, works on a playlist and goes about with tasks she’d assigned herself. She realises: “Everything is uncertain, everywhere. But where I am, there’s a more specific terror... it’s the poverty capital of the world, which means that what works for most of the world won’t work for us.”

Together in crisis

On what triggered the journal that curates accounts of a day in the life of someone, somewhere, Ms. Galappatti says: “We are actually in all moments together as a world, but our connection to someone far away is less visible, less palpable. It struck me here was a moment where we were very consciously all in the same crisis together.”

She added: “At the same time, I find it very dispiriting that it is the nation state that we are falling back on — because it is the infrastructure we have. So we are closing our borders, we are counting within countries. I wanted some way for us to reach across that (safely).”

The journal, describing itself as ‘Solidarity from at least two metres away’, is an attempt to try and make sense of this together, to have people share their experiences across contexts, and hopefully discover how people are experiencing it elsewhere. The exercise is open-ended at the moment, with no specific plan for the content that might accumulate, or a visible deadline. Also, Ms. Galappatti is aware that the journal is necessarily written by those least under pressure in this crisis. Those who have “the shelter, sustenance, and the mind-space”.

Another reason drives her effort. “We are still living a little breathlessly, because that is what we know how to do. We are still online, offering expertise and one-upmanship in virtue. Yet, we are in a situation that we haven’t actually been in before. I thought, what about a quiet, gentle place where we tell stories of ourselves that we may not understand till much later.”

Most entries are everyday stories, simply told as they happened to someone. Reading them, you get a now-familiar sense of the general feeling world over, but also a rarer glimpse of the specific.

BBC news journalists, like their counterparts elsewhere, are “essential workers”. That is why Charles Haviland left for work on March 24 in London. He took the Tube — less crowded than usual but not empty enough for comfort — and reached the New Broadcasting House. The few who turned up were sitting, separated by empty desks. A colleague distributed oranges, another offered cartons of skimmed milk that he got from a café upstairs, just before it shut down.

After what has now become a ‘usual news day’— of death tolls and soaring cases — Mr. Haviland was ready to leave. “It is night when I head for home. By Warren Street station, six or seven people, probably homeless, are gathered much too close together. But what comfort can they find apart from each other? They are talking not in English but in... which eastern European language? I can’t get close enough to tell,” he wrote about his day.

15,2020/03/28,"For Afghan Sikhs, it’s between violence and exodus","Sikh community leader says the latest attack on a gurdwara will prompt more of them to flee

A brutal attack on Wednesday targeting a 400-year-old gurdwara in Kabul claimed 25 lives, including two minors and three women, further terrorising Afghanistan’s already dwindling minority Sikh community.

“They had gathered for the morning prayers organised specifically for the nation that was hit by the coronavirus outbreak. They made mannat from god to help the nation pass through the coronavirus crisis with as little difficulties as possible,” says Charan Singh Khalsa, an Afghan Sikh, who lost many relatives in this week’s attack. Two insurgents stormed the historical temple, detonated bombs and opened fire on the worshippers and residents. About 40 families lived on the compound of the gurdwara.

The massacre was claimed by the Islamic State, but authorities believe it to be the work of the Haqqani Network. Either way, for many in the small congregation, this attack was the final straw that broke the camel’s back. “There are less than 100 families of Hindus and Sikhs combined living in Afghanistan. And if you slaughter 25 members of an already small community, what makes you think the rest will want to stay?” asks Mr. Khalsa.

But for Mr. Khalsa, the push was long time coming, with growing number of threats and intimidation. “The Afghan Sikhs have faced a lot of humiliation and persecution over the recent years. Many incidences in the last few years have targeted the Hindus and Sikhs,” he says. “My own brother was kidnapped last year and murdered. We found his body in a grave two months later. More recently, a Sikh home in Kabul was attacked and robbed; an old lady in the house was killed. And earlier this month, on Holi, a Sikh shop was attacked, and its owner was injured,” he narrates incidents after incidents, the frustration evident in his voice.

Living in fear

Historically, the Sikhs and Hindus of Afghanistan have a rich history intertwined strongly with the local cultures. Prior to the start of the Afghan civil war in the 1990s, the population was estimated to be around 3,00,000. Many of them were forced to leave, much like their Muslim compatriots, by the growing violence.

While many returned to Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban in 2001, the country they called home was not the one they had left behind. “Today, the Sikhs are afraid to even go to the gurdwaras. In the last 24 hours (after the Kabul attack) alone, there have been three other explosions close to the community, although no one was hurt. We are living in fear,” Mr. Khalsa says.

While Mr. Khalsa’s frustration was echoed among many in Afghanistan, there was also an outpour of grief and solidarity for the endangered community.

“At a time when the entire world is facing a pandemic, Afghanistan faces the usual killing of innocents by terrorists and evil soldiers,” says Lima Ahmad, an Afghan academic. “Yesterday (Wednesday) Harundar Singh lost seven members of his family, including his child, mother, and wife, not to coronavirus, but to the virus called terrorism that has been killing innocent people in Afghanistan for many years,” she points out, referring to one of the survivors of the attack.

“In such an uncertain time where most of us are suffering from lockdown and the unknown future, many people such as Harundar Singh are left with no family members,” Ms. Ahmad says. Afghanistan is currently dealing with 110 cases of COVID-19 and threats of a possible medical emergency, which has resulted in the lockdown of two major cities, including the capital and the western city of Herat that borders Iran.

But despite the solidarity, Mr. Khalsa is certain that the gurdwara attack will trigger another exodus of the Sikhs. “This incident will ensure that the remaining few of us will also leave the country. There will be hardly any Sikhs or Hindus remaining in Afghanistan in the coming weeks,” he adds, urging government and international organisations to step in and help the Sikhs. “I hope the government and international organisations will at least protect our historical and religious sites here once the community has all left.”

Mr. Khalsa clarifies that his appeal does not mean that he doesn’t love his country. “I am proud to be Afghan. No matter where we go, we will wear that identity with pride. We will not forget our country, but we have sacrificed so much already. But if something brings you pain, there is only so much you can tolerate,” he explains, adding a common Hindi-phrase altered to fit the situation, “Agar jaan hai, toh Afghan hai— If I am alive, I am an Afghan.”

17,2020/03/28,The Indian who made a Japanese movie,"Chauhan’s film, Bad Poetry Tokyo, won several global awards, including Grand Prize at Brussels

Bad Poetry Tokyo, a small-budget Japanese film, has been the darling of the international film festival circuit since 2018, winning a slew of prizes. Featuring the greatest hits of cinema vérité — sex, violence, emotional trauma, all filmed with a handheld camera — at first glance it’s a standard art house movie. But there is a plot twist. The director, Anshul Chauhan, is a young Indian man with no film background and only a smattering of Japanese.

Mr. Chauhan was born in 1986 in a small town called Mainpuri, near Agra, and was destined for the Army. His father was a soldier and a strict disciplinarian, who brooked no dissent, packing off his son to a military school in Rajasthan as soon as he was old enough to go. Bullied by teachers and senior students, Mr. Chauhan detested school and ran away several times. At university, the young man defied his father to study geography.

He recalls how everything changed for him one day in 2004 following a chance encounter on a train. Returning home from an entrance exam for a Masters degree in Geo-informatics, Mr. Chauhan struck up a conversation with a fellow traveller who introduced himself as an animator.

He was immediately intrigued and spent the next few years training himself in animation, eventually working at studios in Bengaluru and Pune. In 2011, Mr. Chauhan overheard colleagues talking about a studio, Polygon Pictures, in Japan that was hiring Indians. A few months later, he was on a plane to Tokyo, to start a job as an animator. It was well paid and steady. And even his father finally seemed reconciled to his life choices.

But this being Mr. Chauhan, the whimsy and ambition were unstoppable. In 2013, he woke up one day with a strong, somewhat inexplicable, desire to make a movie. He bought a camera and made a few shorts. Eventually, he quit his job to focus on film-making full time, but had to rejoin a few months later having gone through all his savings. Yet, what he describes as the “movie bug” kept gnawing at him, and in 2017, he left his job yet again to make Bad Poetry Tokyo. It was his first feature-length film, and was shot over four weeks in May, paid for with his slim savings. Locations and actors were found via Facebook.

International recognition

By this time, Mr. Chauhan was married to his long-term Japanese girlfriend, Mina, who acted as translator, reworking the script he had written into Japanese. The cast was largely bilingual, which helped the newly minted director achieve his vision with conviction, despite the cultural barriers. Against the odds, the movie won the Grand Prize at the Brussels International Independent Film Festival. This was followed by a best actress award at the Osaka Asian Films Festival and the prize for best narrative feature film at the Venice Film Week.

Mr. Chauhan was hopeful that the awards would help him secure a commercial release for the movie in Japan but every distributor he approached turned him away. He is reluctant to outright ascribe this refusal to racism. “It was confusing for them. What is an Indian doing making a Japanese movie? No one could understand,” he said. Mr. Chauhan’s explanation to them was simple. “I live in Japan, so I make a movie here. What can be more normal?”

It took two years for Bad Poetry Tokyo to finally see the light of day in its “home” country. Bypassing the distributors, who seemed intent on ignoring him, Mr. Chauhan eventually took a DVD copy of the film directly to a large theatre owner, who was so impressed that he wrote Mr. Chauhan a recommendation letter guaranteeing a screening for the movie at his theatres. It worked.

Mr. Chauhan was finally able to get his film released in Tokyo in January 2020. The Japan Times reviewer was clearly impressed. “Set in the quiet Japanese countryside, but full of unquiet emotions... without Chauhan’s name on the credits, I never would have guessed Bad Poetry Tokyo was by a non-Japanese,” the review raved. Bad Poetry Tokyo was also scheduled for release in the cities of Yokohama and Nagano. Unfortunately the showings coincided with lockdowns due to the spread of COVID-19. “Only five people showed up at the theatre in Yokohama,” said Mr. Chauhan ruefully.

But the film-maker remains undaunted. He has already completed filming his next feature titled Kontora, about a young Japanese girl who chances upon her grandfather’s diary written during the Second World War. And he is now figuring out the path to his next goal — a Hindi movie with a Japanese connect.

18,2020/03/28,Favelas left to fight it alone in Brazil,"The nation’s vast shanty towns are facing the twin threat of the deadly coronavirus and hunger

Blame it on City of God. Fernando Meirelles’s cult flick of 2002 exposed Brazil’s underbelly — a shanty town where armed drug lords ruled the streets, everybody robbed everyone else and blood drained into sewers every day. Mr. Meirelles made the word favela (slum) and ‘City of God’, a dusty patch on the western fringe of Rio de Janeiro, famous across the globe. But Brazil’s upper crust showed little interest in the film. It just reconfirmed their prejudice: favelas are breeding grounds of drugs and death, and a threat to the noble lanes.

Last Sunday, City of God became the first favela in Brazil to record a COVID-19 case, sending a shiver across the country. The news invoked fears of the virus rampaging the slums, gaining strength and then ravaging the posh areas. But the story is entirely different. According to a survey, 70% of cases in Rio were reported from rich areas. Of these, some 40% had just returned from abroad. In Sao Paulo, which is becoming the COVID-19 epicentre in South America, the first reported case was of a man who had travelled to Italy. In fact, the first few dozens of cases were treated at the Albert Einstein Hospital, a super-expensive private medical centre in Sao Paulo.

The favelas are worried. They are facing the twin threat of the deadly virus and hunger. “Rich people went abroad and got infected. They came back and passed the virus to their maids and nannies who took it to the favela where people live in small houses close to each other. Now, people are getting sick in our communities and rich people are dismissing the maids. We are the victims here,” says Vera Mendes, 39, who lost her job as a maid in three of the four houses she used to work for. “They didn’t even bother to pay the salary,” says Ms. Mendes, adding that a vast majority of her neighbours in Paraisópolis, the biggest favela with 1,00,000 residents, have lost their jobs as domestic helps.

Rate trajectory

It’s just a month since the virus came to this country. As of Saturday, Brazil had reported 3,477 infections and 93 deaths, a majority of them in Sao Paulo State, which has been under a lockdown since Tuesday. As the country follows the infections rate trajectory of Italy and Spain, the lockdowns may be extended. But a significant number of persons from favelas continue to work in supermarkets, food delivery restaurants and pharmacies, and ride-sharing apps are still working. With these workers using buses and subways, community leaders are worried. “Since last week, the number of suspicious cases in Paraisópolis has grown. Most informal workers who have been dismissed from work are still going out looking for work. If they do not get immediate relief, we face a huge problem,” says Gilson Rodrigues, the president of the residents’ union of Paraisópolis.

With the federal government led by far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who is still mocking the virus as “little flu”, delivering little help to the country’s working class, the favela residents are taking the matter into their own hands. Mr. Rodrigues is one of the founders of the “G10 in the Favelas”, a group that brings together social entrepreneurs from the main favelas in Brazil. The group is providing help to the people in their communities. “We lack two basic things — information and water. We are sharing information about the virus and jobs and bringing water to our people,” says Mr. Rodrigues. “There should be a government action to save people’s lives. But they are concerned about the economy, not about the people.”

Under pressure from firms which have lost big money on the stock market, Mr. Bolsonaro has been threatening to “open the economy” soon. Attacking State Governors, who have imposed lockdowns, the President has gone to the extent of asking his supporters to organise road shows to demand cancellation of the lockdowns. “I saw a man jumping into the sewer. He dived into it and got out alright. Nothing happened to him,” said Mr. Bolsonaro on Thursday, claiming that the Brazilians were immune to the virus.

The federal government’s response to the pandemic has been so cavalier that drug gangs have stepped in to fill the vacuum in the slums. According to reports in the local media, drug traffickers have imposed a “coronavirus curfew” in various favelas of Rio, including the City of God. In a widely-circulated video this week, gang members can be seen moving in the lanes of the community of 40,000 residents, telling people “to stay at home and chill”.

In the time of COVID-19, the City of God is back in the grip of its drug lords.

22,2020/03/28,Coronavirus: US to airlift citizens stranded in India,"The US government is making arrangements to airlift over 2,000 American citizens stranded in India due to the suspension of flights and the lockdown in the country to limit the spread of the cornovirus pandemic, the State Department has said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced a three-week lockdown in the country as part of measures to curb the spread of coronavirus that has claimed over 26,000 lives globally.

Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Ian Brownlee, Bureau of Consular Affairs on COVID-19, said that there were about 1,500 Americans in the New Delhi area, between 600 and 700 in the Mumbai area and 300 to 400 Americans elsewhere who have identified themselves.

“We are working with a multiplicity of options here. There is a church group that has chartered a large aircraft. We are facilitating the necessary permits for that aircraft. They’re ready to take out 150 or so Americans. We are working directly with both US and foreign carriers to lay on aircraft direct from India to the United States,” he said during a briefing on Friday.

“The permitting is what’s complicated at the moment. We’re ready to act on this, but it’s the permitting that takes a while both in India and the United States. So we’re hopeful, and I think with reason we are hopeful, that those flights will begin within several days, within about three days or so,” he said.

He said the State Department was tracking 33,000 citizens stranded abroad due to lockdowns and/or cancellation of flights who wanted help returning home.

Earlier this week, the State Department said 50,000 were stuck overseas but that number might have been an overstatement because of clerical errors, according to Brownlee.

Some Americans have decided to wait out the curfew or the quarantine where they are and many of them are expats with homes in the countries they are located in, he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-us-to-airlift-citizens-stranded-in-india/article31191444.ece
23,2020/03/28,Abbott wins U.S. approval for test that can detect COVID-19 in five minutes,"Abbott said in a statement that it plans to begin distributing the test next week and will ramp up manufacturing to 50,000 tests per day.

Abbott Laboratories said on Friday that it won U.S. marketing approval for a diagnostic test for the COVID-19 that can deliver results within minutes and be used in physicians offices and urgent care clinics, as well as hospitals.

The United States now has more cases of the COVID-19 than any other country, and hospitals are struggling to meet the demand to test thousands of people for the often-deadly virus.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted the approval under its Emergency Use Authorization.

Abbott said in a statement that it plans to begin distributing the test next week and will ramp up manufacturing to 50,000 tests per day.

“This is a significant leap forward,” John Frels, vice president of research and development at Abbott, said in an interview with Reuters. “You can get a positive result in five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes. You can walk into a clinic and literally get results while you are there.”

The portable test will run on Abbott's ID NOW platform.

It is the second test to be approved by the FDA that can be used directly in physicians' offices and other community healthcare settings and promptly provide results to patients. Last week, the FDA approved a test made by Cepheid that can be used at the point of care.

“The COVID-19 pandemic will be fought on multiple fronts, and a portable molecular test that offers results in minutes adds to the broad range of diagnostic solutions needed to combat this virus,” said Robert Ford, president and chief operating officer at Abbott, in a statement.

Abbott received approval last week for a high volume, automated diagnostic test that can be used in laboratories and said at the time it would immediately distribute 150,000 of the tests around the country.

Between the two platforms, Abbott said it plans to produce 5 million tests per month.

The FDA has been rushing to approve tests for the coronavirus on an emergency basis and has approved others made by companies including Roche Holding AG and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eh6yu5/article31191417.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/coronavirusjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/abbott-wins-us-approval-for-test-that-can-detect-covid-19-in-five-minutes/article31191385.ece
24,2020/03/28,Will consider Pakistan’s request for financial aid to cope with coronavirus outbreak challenges: IMF,"The COVID-19 cases in Pakistan on Saturday rose to over 1,320, including 11 deaths.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said it would consider Pakistan’s request for financial assistance to cope with the challenges being posed by the novel coronavirus outbreak in the country.

The COVID-19 cases in Pakistan on Saturday rose to over 1,320, including 11 deaths.

Cash-strapped Pakistan had requested for financial assistance under the IMF’s Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) facility to shore up the country’s foreign exchange reserves and budgetary support in the wake of the adverse impact of the global coronavirus pandemic on its economy.

“Our team is working expeditiously to respond to this request so that a proposal can be considered by the IMF’s executive board as soon as possible,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement released to the media by the Fund’s Islamabad-based office on Friday.

On March 4, the IMF had announced that it would support vulnerable countries with different lending facilities, including through rapid-disbursing emergency financing, which could amount up to $50 billion for low-income and emerging markets. Of this, $10 billion is available at zero interest for the poorest members through the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF), the Dawn News reported.

On March 25, Hafeez Shaikh, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance, announced that Pakistan has arranged about $4 billion additional financial assistance from multilateral lending and aid agencies, including $ 1.4 billion additional funds from the IMF.

Soon after the announcement, the IMF chief confirmed Pakistan’s request for financial assistance under the RFI to ensure prompt and adequate relief to the people and the economy.

The emergency financing, Georgieva said, would allow Pakistan to address additional and urgent balance of payments needs and support policies that would make it possible to direct funds swiftly to the country’s most affected sectors, including social protection, daily-wage earners and the healthcare system.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/drmwsz/article30941693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMFFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/will-consider-pakistans-request-for-financial-aid-to-cope-with-coronavirus-outbreak-challenges-imf/article31190829.ece
25,2020/03/28,"Coronavirus | Tokyo asks people to stay home amid virus, many venture out","Mr. Abe, who has not declared a national state of emergency, is expected to order economic steps including $135 billion or more in spending, government officials and lawmakers say, joining policymakers globally trying to blunt a downturn.

People in greater Tokyo and the Osaka area in western Japan hunkered down on Saturday as officials urged citizens to stay indoors to prevent a potential emergency, but some were carrying on as normal.

Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike's plea for the tens of millions of people in the capital and surrounding regions to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings until April 12, and particularly this weekend, followed a surge in coronavirus infections this week that she said put Tokyo on the brink of an emergency.

Ms. Koike urged the public to avoid the national pastime of congregating to drink and watch the cherry blossoms as they hit their peak in the capital, saying on Friday, “The cherry blossoms will bloom again next year.”

Infections in Japan have climbed to more than 1,400, with 47 deaths, excluding those from a cruise ship quarantined last month. Hit early by the coronavirus in its initial spread from China, Japan had seen a more gradual rise than the recent surge in much of Europe and the United States.

This week, however, saw an acceleration that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called “a national crisis”.

Infections on Friday rose by a daily record 102, said public broadcaster NHK. Tokyo reported 40 new cases on Friday, bringing its total to 299.

While those figures are not high for a city of nearly 14 million, with many millions more in neighbouring suburbs, experts warn of a high risk of an explosive rise in infections, since authorities have not been able to track all the contacts of more than half the newest cases.

The government has deployed the military to greater Tokyo's Narita and Haneda airports to assist in virus screenings and the transport of people placed in quarantine, NHK said.

The voluntary calls by Ms. Koike and other Japanese leaders for people to stay at home compares with the more rigours lockdowns in major cities in Italy, Britain, France, Spain, and the United States - the new global epicentre of the virus.

Globally, infections have topped half a million with more than 20,000 deaths, with the contagion affecting more than 100 countries.

Mr. Abe, who has not declared a national state of emergency, is expected to order economic steps including $135 billion or more in spending, government officials and lawmakers say, joining policymakers globally trying to blunt a downturn.

In a quiet neighbourhood close to the prime minister's private residence in central Tokyo, the scene was typical of a Saturday morning. Some people were jogging and walking their dogs. A few stopped to pray at a local shrine. Auto traffic was brisk on local roads.

“I'm a little worried, but I have an appointment today, which is why I'm outside,” said a 41-year old man walking down the street, who declined to be named.

“It's not something that I can't cancel, but I do have to meet someone. I will be riding the train later.”

Trains weren't empty but were far less crowded than on a normal weekend. Some department stores, movie theatres, museums and parks closed, but many supermarkets and convenience stores were open as usual.

In Setagaya, a popular residential area in western Tokyo, many restaurants and shops were shut, although those that were open were doing brisk business, including an Italian restaurant that was filled with some young families and older couples.

Nearby, labourers worked on a construction site as if it were a normal day.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1yjb2m/article31189844.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAPANFINANCIALMARKETS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tokyo-asks-people-to-stay-home-amid-virus-many-venture-out/article31189845.ece

The United States now has more than 100,000 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, a tracker maintained by Johns Hopkins University showed Friday. There have been 100,717 cases including 1,544 deaths as of 6:00 pm Eastern time.

The biggest cluster by far is in New York, home to almost half the cases, overwhelming the hospital system. The United States has around 15,000 more confirmed cases then the second country on the list, Italy, and 20,000 more than China, where the disease was first identified but has since peaked.

The U.S. death rate based on confirmed cases is about 1.5%, compared to around 10.5% in Italy. This death rate figure could fall, as greater testing reveals more people who are positive but asymptomatic.

It may also rise if more cities and states find themselves in a similar position to New York, which has seen more than 500 deaths and is experiencing a drastic shortage of hospital beds, personal protective equipment and ventilators.

""We're still seeing a rising number of cases, a rising number of hospitalizations, rising number of intensive care unit admission, a rising number of patients with the mechanical ventilators,"" Thomas Tsai, a professor of health policy at Harvard told AFP.

29,2020/03/28,China to share coronavirus data with US: Trump,"Mr. Trump spoke to Mr. Xi over telephone, days after the US president angered Beijing by referring to the coronavirus as “Chinese virus” and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China’s ruling Communist Party posed a “substantial threat” to Americans’ health and their way of life.

China will share its data related to the novel coronavirus pandemic with the US and the country will learn from Beijing’s experience, President Donald Trump has said, a day after he held an hour-long conversation with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.

Mr. Trump spoke to Mr. Xi over telephone, days after the U.S. president angered Beijing by referring to the coronavirus as “Chinese virus” and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China’s ruling Communist Party posed a “substantial threat” to Americans’ health and their way of life.

Mr. Xi assured full support to Mr. Trump in fighting the coronavirus as America emerged as the next major epicentre of the pandemic, but underlined that infectious diseases did not recognise any border or race.

“We talked about it (coronavirus) because he had additional experience of having been much earlier. And he has developed some incredible theories, and all that information is coming over here. A lot of it’s already come. We call it data. And we’re going to learn a lot from what the Chinese went through,” Trump told reporters on Friday.

Mr. Trump said he had nearly an hour-long meeting with Mr. Xi, which mostly focused on fast spreading coronavirus pandemic.

“One of the things I was asking him is when did you notice that this was happening. We talked about the whole concept, how it happened, when it happened, what was the most effective use. I mean, was it the fact was distance the best thing. We talked about everything,” he said.

Mr. Trump said that his Chinese counterpart had developed his own viewpoint on the escalating COVID-19 crisis.

“It happened there actually long before it happen here. By the way, it would have happened here a lot sooner had we not kept those people out, the Chinese people coming over to the country, had we not kept amount,” he said.

“Our relationship with China is very good. We also talked about the trade agreement. But I must tell you this whole invisible enemy has taken over the world. Nobody cares about trade. Nobody cares about anything. You want to talk about trade, they immediately get back to this (coronavirus),” he said.

According to a White House readout of the call, both leaders reiterated their commitment to cooperate to protect lives and livelihoods.

“The two leaders agreed to work together to defeat the coronavirus pandemic and restore global health and prosperity,” the White House said.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump referring to his phone call with Xi said that they have had a very tough experience.

“And they’re doing well and he’s doing well. President Xi is doing very well. We learned a lot and we have great communication together,” he said.

“We’re going to be sent great data from China - things that happened that they see that - you know, they’ve had an early experience, and we’re getting all of that information. Much of it has already been sent. It was sent yesterday and sent to our scientists to study,” Mr. Trump said.

Meanwhile, the US State Department told reporters that China continued with its negative campaign against the US.

“On China, over the course of the crisis we’ve monitored a couple of narrative tracks. One is malign disinformation to falsely blame the US as the origin of the coronavirus and the second has been China’s effort to turn the crisis into a news story highlighting supremacy of the Chinese Communist Party in handling the health crisis,” said Special Envoy Lea Gabrielle, Global Engagement Center On Disinformation and Propaganda.

“What we’ve seen is the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) mobilizing its global messaging apparatus, which includes state media as well as Chinese diplomats, to push out selected and localized versions of the same overarching false narratives,” she said.

Of late, there has been initial indications of messaging refinement away from disinformation by Chinese officials on social media, she noted.

China has focused on four prominent narratives. One was China’s successful containment of the virus. A second was calls for international collaboration. Third was the World Health Organization’s praise of China. And fourth was China’s economic resilience. Anti-US tweets comprised a small subset, about 88 % of the sample.

This “actually performed poorly as African audiences essentially rejected the claims that coronavirus had originated in the US, and that they also were rejecting claims that the term, quote, “Chinese virus” was a racist reference. They were rejecting that claim. So interestingly, we see that move away that I mentioned of messaging on disinformation, and rather, a refocus on praising China’s actions,” Ms. Gabrielle said.

According to Johns Hopkins University data, 27,333 people have died due to the disease across over 170 coutries. Italy has the highest number of deaths at 9,134, followed by Spain 5,138 and China 3,174.

30,2020/03/28,"Coronavirus: Turkey adopts ‘voluntary quarantine’, suspends international flights","Pandemic councils to be formed in 30 biggest cities to take additional precautions if necessary

President Tayyip Erdogan called on March 27 for a “voluntary quarantine” in which Turks stay at home except for shopping or basic needs to stem a surge of coronavirus cases, which jumped by a third in a day to 5,698 with 92 dead.

“If we don't want these measures to reach a further stage, we must abide by the voluntary quarantine rules verbatim. What does this voluntary quarantine mean? It means do not leave your house,” Erdogan told a press conference late on Friday.

The rate of infections in Turkey has outstripped most other countries in the last two weeks with 2,069 more cases in the last 24 hours, the country's health minister said earlier on Friday in calling for wider measures to contain the outbreak.

Erdogan also announced an end to all international flights, and said pandemic councils will be formed in Turkey's 30 biggest cities to take additional precautions if necessary. “By taking care of social distancing at home and at work, by not using public transportation unless necessary, by not leaving the house apart from fundamental shopping needs, by taking care of our cleanliness, it is mandatory that we increase the effectiveness of these measures,” he added.

Turkey's government says it is not disclosing the location of cases to prevent the risk of increasing transmission rates by encouraging people to move from areas with high rates to places where there are no or few cases.

Ramping up measures against the outbreak, Turkey also limited intercity bus travel and banned walks and fishing along the seashore and beaches, as well as jogging in forests and parks on weekends.

Local governors could decide to extend the decision to week days, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told an interview on NTV news channel.

31,2020/03/28,Coronavirus: Hungary imposes two-week lockdown,"Orban said the epidemic was expected to peak in Hungary in June or July

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced a two-week lockdown on March 27 and pressed on with plans to give the government extra powers to fight COVID-19, despite criticism by rights groups.

People will be allowed to go to work and do basic errands and exercise in the open, but not gather in large groups under measures that take effect on March 28. Orban said the epidemic was expected to peak in Hungary in June or July and flagged more ecomomic stimulus to be announced in April.

“Restrictions put in place so far have been efficient,” he told public radio, but said additional measures were needed to step up the fight against the coronavirus.

The Prime Minister, who has gradually increased his power during his decade in office, has proposed an open-ended extension of a state of emergency that would give the government the right to pass decrees to handle the crisis.

Criticism by human rights groups

Legislation on the proposal — which has triggered criticism by human rights groups and the Council of Europe, Europe's main rights forum — contains no timeframe. Orban's Fidesz party has a strong majority in parliament and the assembly is expected to pass the bill on Monday without support from the opposition, which has rejected it.

U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a news conference the bill “appears to give the government practically unlimited powers to rule by decree and bypass parliamentary scrutiny with no clear cut-off date.”

He also said a part of the legislation that would impose prison sentences of up to five years on people spreading false information about the crisis could “negatively affect the legitimate work of journalists and have a potentially chilling effect on freedom of expression in Hungary.”

“Fake news”

Justice Minister Judit Varga rejected criticism of the bill and said it was “very damaging fake news” that the law was intended to neutralise the national assembly or give the government unlimited scope to act. She said the government would be empowered to adopt only measures that were necessary and proportionate to fight the virus. “This law (allows) the government to act,” she said, adding that the bill was also designed to punish any intentional ”malicious disinformation campaign.”

33,2020/03/28,"'Sorry, some will die': President Jair Bolsonaro on Brazil's coronavirus death toll","The President accused a state governor of manipulating the numbers for political ends, without giving evidence for his claims.

Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday cast doubt on Sao Paulo's death toll from the coronavirus outbreak and accused the state governor of manipulating the numbers for political ends, without giving evidence for his claims.

Mr. Bolsonaro's accusations were the latest broadside in an ugly battle with Brazil's governors, who have chafed at the President's view that protecting the economy takes priority over social distancing measures to combat the spread of the highly contagious virus.

Following the advice of public health experts, the vast majority of the country's 26 governors have banned non-essential commercial activities and public services to contain the outbreak in their states.

“I'm sorry, some people will die, they will die, that's life,” Mr. Bolsonaro said in a television interview on Friday night. ”You can't stop a car factory because of traffic deaths.”

Mr. Bolsonaro said that in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil's economic powerhouse, the death toll seemed “too large.” Sao Paulo has the most cases and deaths so far of coronavirus in Brazil, at 1,223 cases and 68 deaths.

“We need to look at what is happening there, this cannot be a numbers game to favour political interests,” Mr. Bolsonaro said.

Earlier on Friday, Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, a former Bolsonaro ally who many expect to be a rival in the 2022 presidential election, accused Mr. Bolsonaro of promoting ”disinformation” by launching a TV ad campaign criticizing the restrictions, featuring the slogan “#BrazilCannotStop.”

The slogan is similar to a campaign in Milan before deaths in Italy soared.

Action taken

Brazil's justice ministry on Friday barred all non-resident foreigners from entering the country via its airports. The travel ban goes into effect on Monday and follows similar measures in several other South American nations.

Also on Friday, Brazil's central bank called for emergency bond-buying powers in line with 'quantitative easing' policies in other countries, while unveiling a 40 billion reais credit line to help smaller companies with payroll.

Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said the government will offer 45 billion reais to self-employed and informal workers, adding that all the government's coronavirus-fighting measures will total 700 billion reais over three months.

Confirmed coronavirus cases in the country jumped to 3,417 on Friday from 1,891 on Monday, as related deaths climbed to 92, according to the Health Ministry.

Mr. Bolsonaro's popularity has slipped during the crisis, and many people across Brazil bang pots and pans in their windows nightly in protest at his handling of it.

In counter-protests on Friday, Bolsonaro supporters drove honking caravans through major cities to oppose the lockdowns, sharing social media videos with the #BrazilCannotStop hashtag.

The TV advertisement, shared on social media by Bolsonaro allies including his son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, was commissioned by the president's office at a cost of 4.9 million reais ($1 million) without consulting the Health Ministry, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.

“For the neighborhood salesmen, for the shop owners in city centers, for domestic employees, for millions of Brazilians, Brazil cannot stop,” said the ad, which shows scenes of crowded classrooms and street markets.

The slogan is similar to #MilanWillNotStop, which became popular in northern Italy in February. Italy went on to become a global epicenter of the outbreak, with more deaths than China.

The mayor of Milan, Beppe Sala, has said he regrets sharing the hashtag.

“Many have referred to that video with a hashtag #MilanWillNotStop. It was a video which went viral on the internet. Everyone was sharing it, I also shared it, rightly or wrongly, probably wrongly,” Sala said in a television interview.

A Health Ministry official told reporters the ministry would not comment on Mr. Bolsonaro and that guidelines recommending social distancing remained the same.

Pope Francis said the coronavirus had put everyone “in the same boat” as he held a dramatic, solitary prayer service in St. Peter's Square on Friday, urging the world to see the crisis as a test of solidarity and a reminder of basic values.

“Thick darkness has gathered over our squares, our streets and our cities,” he said, speaking from the steps of St. Peter's Basilica into an eerily empty and rainy square before delivering an extraordinary “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) blessing - something he normally does only twice a year.

“It has taken over our lives, filling everything with a deafening silence and a distressing void that stops everything as it passes by; we feel it in the air...We find ourselves afraid and lost,” he said.

Pope Francis walks during Urbi and Orbi prayer (Latin for To the City and To the World) in an empty St. Peter's Square, at the Vatican, Friday, March 27, 2020. Praying in a desolately empty St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis on Friday likened the coronavirus pandemic to a storm laying bare illusions that people can be self-sufficient and instead finds all of us fragile and disoriented and needing each other's help and comfort. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.

The Vatican called the service “An Extraordinary Prayer in the Time of Pandemic,” a sombre echo of an announcement by Italian officials minutes earlier that the coronavirus death toll in the country had surged past 9,000.

In the United States, the total number of infections has topped 85,000, making it the world leader in confirmed cases.

Francis walked alone in the rain to a white canopy on the steps of the basilica and spoke sitting alone before a square where he normally draws tens of thousands of people but is now closed because of the pandemic.

“We have realized that we are in the same boat, all of us fragile and disoriented, but at the same time important and needed, all of us called to row together, each of us in need of comforting the other,” he said.

Pope Francis praying by a miraculous crucifix that in 1552 was carried in a procession around Rome to stop the great plague, that was brought from the San Marcello al Corso church in Rome, after presiding over a moment of prayer on the sagrato of St Peter’s Basilica, the platform at the top of the steps immediately in front of the façade of the Church, to be concluded with Pope Francis giving the Urbi et orbi Blessing, on March 27, 2020 at St. Peter's Square in the Vatican.

Francis said the virus had exposed people's vulnerability, “to those false and superfluous certainties around which we have constructed our daily schedules”.

He praised doctors, nurses, supermarket employees, cleaners, care givers, transport workers, police, and volunteers, saying they, and not the world's rich and famous, were “writing the decisive events of our time”.

The leader of the world's 1.3 billion Roman Catholics said God was asking everyone to, “reawaken and put into practice that solidarity and hope capable of giving strength, support and meaning to these hours when everything seems to be floundering.”

He prayed before a wooden crucifix which is normally kept in a Rome church and brought to the Vatican for the special service.

According to tradition, a plague that hit Rome in 1522 began subsiding after the crucifix was taken around the streets of the Italian capital for 16 days in 1522.

35,2020/03/28,Haiti hospital chief kidnapped amid coronavirus emergency,"Dr. Jerry Bitar, a surgeon, was kidnapped shortly after leaving for work at Hospital Bernard Mevs from his home in an upmarket neighborhood of the capital, hospital staff told Reuters.

The director of one of Haiti's top hospitals was kidnapped on Friday, prompting staff to refuse to take in new patients in protest as the impoverished country battles an outbreak of the novel coronavirus amid a spike in gang violence.

Dr. Jerry Bitar, a surgeon, was kidnapped shortly after leaving for work at Hospital Bernard Mevs from his home in an upmarket neighborhood of the capital, hospital staff told Reuters.

Kidnappings for ransom have sharply increased this year amid a political and economic crisis in Haiti, which according to the World Bank is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Police confirmed 15 kidnapping cases in January alone. Gangs appear to strike indiscriminately, with victims ranging from Haitian schoolchildren, lawmakers and businessmen to foreign aid workers.

A crowd gathered outside the facility in solidarity with Dr. Bitar, who runs the hospital together with his twin brother, while staff chanted in unison calls for his release. Haitian media outlets also pleaded for bandits to free Bitar.

“In the face of the coronavirus pandemic, it is abnormal to take the hospital's doctor,” said Jean Wilguens Charles, a local resident whose friends have received treatment at the hospital. ”We demand his liberation without conditions.”

Medical assistant Claude Devil said the hospital usually attended all Haitians, including those who had no money to pay for services, but would not take in new patients while still attempting to look after existing ones as best possible.

“There are several patients waiting to be operated but we cannot work without the doctors' order,” he said.

The relevant authorities are following the case, a Health Ministry spokesman said.

The Bernard Mevs hospital is a trauma and critical care center and is not treating coronavirus cases currently, but could need to if the disease spreads substantially in the country, where healthcare services and sanitation infrastructure are inadequate.

According to a 2019 study by the Research and Education consortium for Acute Care in Haiti (REACH), Haiti has only 64 ventilators for a population of around 11 million, which makes it especially vulnerable to an outbreak of the highly contagious coronavirus, which causes the respiratory illness COVID-19.

“This is a serious concern, especially given the relatively high proportion of the population considered to be at an elevated risk,” the Center for Economic and Policy Research wrote in a paper published on Friday, co-authored by its analysts Jake Johnston and Kira Paulemon.

Haitian authorities have so far confirmed eight cases of the coronavirus. President Jovenel Moise last week declared a state of emergency, ordering schools, factories, and places of worship shut to prevent the spread of the virus, closing the countrys borders to people and imposing a curfew.

But the streets continue to buzz as many in the country, where more than half the population lives under the poverty line, ignore recommendations to stay at home or practice social distancing. Many do not have access to sources of news.

Even with the best intentions, tricky access to clean water makes it difficult for Haitians to frequently wash their hands, the hygiene mantra that health experts are preaching as a top defense against the spread of the coronavirus.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mr96mh/article31189234.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/haitijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/haiti-hospital-chief-kidnapped-amid-coronavirus-emergency/article31189173.ece
36,2020/03/28,Coronavirus: U.S. announces $174 mn aid to 64 countries including $2.9 mn to India,"According to United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Deputy Administrator, the new assistance builds on the U.S.’ record of global health leadership.

The United States on Friday announced $174 million financial assistance to 64 countries including $2.9 million to India to help them fight the coronavirus pandemic.

This is in addition to the $100 million aid announced by the U.S. in February.

The newly announced assistance is part of a larger American global response package across multiple departments and agencies, including the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The funding is for 64 of the most at-risk countries facing the threat of the global pandemic.

The U.S. State Department said it is providing $2.9 million to help the Indian government prepare laboratory systems, activate case finding and event-based surveillance, and support technical experts for response and preparedness, and more.

“This builds upon the foundation of more than $1.4 billion in health assistance out of the more than $2.8 billion in U.S. assistance for India over the last 20 years,” the State Department said.

According to United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Deputy Administrator Bonnie Glick, the new assistance builds on the U.S.’ record of global health leadership.

“For decades, the United States has been the world’s largest provider of bilateral assistance in public health. The U.S. has saved lives, protected people who are most vulnerable to disease, built health institutions, and promoted the stability of communities and nations,” he told reporters.

In South Asia, the State Department is providing $1 million in health funding to help it strengthen monitoring and better prepare communities to identify potential outbreaks. To bolster its national COVID-19 action plan, the United States has also redirected more than $1 million in existing funding for training of healthcare providers and other urgent needs.

37,2020/03/28,"Wall Street tumbles as U.S. virus cases pass 100,000","After the market closed, President Donald Trump signed the stimulus package into law.

Wall Street stocks tumbled on Friday, ending a massive three-day surge after doubts about the fate of the U.S. economy resurfaced and the number of coronavirus cases in the country climbed.

U.S. stocks deepened their losses late in the session, even after the House of Representatives approved a $2.2 trillion aid package — the largest in American history — to help people and companies cope with an economic downturn caused by the coronavirus outbreak and provide hospitals with urgently needed medical supplies.

The United States has surpassed China and Italy as the country with the most coronavirus cases. The number of U.S. cases passed 100,000, and the death toll exceeded 1,500.

“We have still not fully understood the degree of the economic impact,” warned Massud Ghaussy, senior analyst at Nasdaq IR Intelligence in New York.

“Currently, from a policymaker's perspective, it's a relative balance between managing the spread of the virus and opening the economy.”

After the market closed, President Donald Trump signed the stimulus package into law.

The bill, along with unprecedented policy easing by the Federal Reserve, helped the S&P 500 surge 10.2% for the week, its best week since 2009. But the U.S. stock market benchmark is still down about 25% from its February high.

In its strongest three-day performance since 1931, the Dow surged 21% in three straight days through Thursday, establishing it in a bull market, according to one widely used definition. Even after Friday's drop, the Dow ended 12.8% higher, its best week since 1938.

Many investors see a strong risk the market could fall deeply again as coronavirus infections increase.

“Next week will depend on what happens over the weekend,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. ”If there is a major acceleration over the weekend of coronavirus cases in New York and other states and the hospital system continues to get jammed up, then I think it will be a rough week for the market.”

Macroeconomic indicators offered a glimpse of the economic devastation from the crisis as the lockdown of major cities upends the lives of millions of Americans.

U.S. consumer sentiment dropped to a near 3-1/2-year low in March, according to a survey released on Friday, a day after data showed a record 3 million surge in jobless claims last week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 4.06% to end at 21,636.78 points, while the S&P 500 lost 3.37% to 2,541.47.

The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.79% to 7,502.38.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.4 billion shares, its lowest since March 5, according to Refinitiv data.

Delta Airlines, American Airlines and United Airlines fell between 6% and 11% as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the help designated for airlines in the aid package was not a bailout and that taxpayers would need to be compensated.

Boeing Co slumped 10%, but was still up more than 70% for the week, after Mnuchin said the planemaker had no intention of using federal money.

The banking index fell 4.6%, tracking U.S. Treasury yields as investors sought safety in high-quality assets.

The energy index was the biggest percentage loser among the 11 major S&P sectors, sliding 6.9%, following a drop in oil prices.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.98-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded nine new highs and 39 new lows.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4zaprn/article31188883.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USAjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wall-street-tumbles-as-us-virus-cases-pass-100000/article31188854.ece
38,2020/03/28,Coronavirus | Trump signs $2.2 trillion stimulus after swift congressional votes,"Washington moved urgently to stem an economic free fall caused by widespread restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus

President Donald Trump signed an unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package into law Friday, after swift and near-unanimous action by Congress to support businesses, rush resources to overburdened health care providers and help struggling families during the deepening coronavirus epidemic.

Acting with unity and resolve unseen since the 9/11 attacks, Washington moved urgently to stem an economic free fall caused by widespread restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus that have shuttered schools, closed businesses and brought American life in many places to a virtual standstill.

""This will deliver urgently needed relief,” Trump said as he signed the bill in the Oval Office, flanked only by Republican lawmakers. He thanked members of both parties for putting Americans “first.”

Earlier Friday, the House gave near-unanimous approval by voice vote after an impassioned session conducted along the social distancing guidelines imposed by the crisis. Many lawmakers sped to Washington to participate - their numbers swollen after a maverick Republican signaled he’d try to force a roll call vote - though dozens of others remained safely in their home districts.

The Senate passed the bill unanimously late Wednesday, 96-0.

""Today we’ve all acknowledged our nation faces an economic and health emergency of historic proportions,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. She said Americans deserve a full-on government response “to address these threats to their lives and their livelihood and they need it now.”

The $2.2 trillion legislation will speed government payments of $1,200 to most Americans and increase jobless benefits for millions of people thrown out of work. Businesses big and small will get loans, grants and tax breaks. It will send unprecedented billions to states and local governments, and the nation’s all but overwhelmed health care system.

""This is not a time for cynicism or invective or second-guessing,” said GOP Whip Liz Cheney of Wyoming. “This is a time to remember that we are citizens of the greatest nation on Earth, that we have overcome every challenge we have faced, and we will overcome this one.”

Despite reservations, arch conservatives joined with progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to back the bill, which moved quickly through a Congress that’s been battered by partisanship and is itself not immune to the suffering the virus has caused. Reps. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., and Mike Kelly, R-Pa., announced Friday that they’d tested positive, bringing the number of infected lawmakers to five.

Tea party Republicans said government orders to shutter businesses merited actions that conflict with their small-government ideology. Liberals accepted generous corporate rescues that accompany larger unemployment benefits, deferrals of student loans, and an enormous surge of funding for health care and other agencies responding to the crisis.

""I’m going to have to vote for something that has things in it that break my heart,” said conservative Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz.

Many lawmakers summoned the bipartisan spirit of 9/11 and efforts to fight terrorism. Others praised the roles low-income workers play in keeping the country going and the heroism of health care workers. Some, like Iowa Democrat Abby Finkenauer, who had just learned of two additional coronavirus-related deaths in her district, came close to tears.

Others couldn’t restrain their partisan impulses. Republicans chided Democratic leaders for delays and provisions they see as extraneous, such as funding for public broadcasting and the arts; Democrats said too many elements are a bailout for corporations that may not need it.

Still, in a chamber increasingly populated by lawmakers whose chief skill often seems to be partisan attacks, Friday’s debate was a noteworthy break.

""We have no time to dither,” said Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va. “We have no time to engage in ideological or petty partisan fights. Our country needs us as one.”

The run-up to the vote contained an element of drama because libertarian conservative Thomas Massie, R-Ky., announced plans to seek a roll call vote.

Leaders of both parties united to prevent that because it would have forced lawmakers back to the Capitol or blemished their voting records if they stayed home. Instead, they made sure enough lawmakers would attend Friday’s session to block Massie’s move under the rules, and lawmakers took the unprecedented step of sitting in the visitors galleries to establish the necessary quorum.

House adjourned

The House promptly adjourned for a weeks-long recess but will return later in the spring to consider further legislation.

""This bill is not only a rescue package, it’s a commitment - a commitment that your government, and the people whom you elected to serve you, will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and in the foreseeable future,” said Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.

The massive CARES Act started as a draft plan among Republicans controlling the Senate who were seeking a greater voice in the coronavirus response efforts — especially after Pelosi was a dominant force in earlier legislation imposing a sick leave mandate on businesses.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., welcomed Democratic participation a week ago, and signed off on a major expansion of unemployment insurance, but his efforts to freeze out Pelosi and force a quick agreement were met with Democratic demands for large infusions of aid to states and hospitals, as well as an assortment of smaller items. McConnell and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York wrestled for days, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other administration officials.

Negotiations finally produced a deal early Wednesday morning, and the Senate passed the measure by a 96-0 vote.

The legislation dwarfs prior Washington responses to crises like 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis, and natural disasters.

Key elements are untested, such as grants to small businesses to keep workers on payroll and complex lending programs to larger businesses. Rebate payments will go to people who have retained their jobs. Agencies like the Small Business Administration and state unemployment systems will be severely taxed, and conservatives fear that a new, generous unemployment benefit will dissuade jobless people from returning to the workforce.

The bill amounts to a bridge loan for much of the economy and carries a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget.

The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities.

There is also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads.

It also seeks to strengthen the safety net for the poor and homeless. Schools and students would get relief, small business loans payments would be deferred. Evictions from public housing would be put on pause.

Republicans successfully pressed for an employee retention tax credit designed to help companies keep workers on payroll. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A huge tax break for interest costs and operating losses limited by the 2017 tax overhaul was restored at a $200 billion cost in a boon for the real estate sector.

A 23-year-old man was brutally tortured and left without a single limb in Pakistan’s Punjab province for allegedly marrying a girl without the consent of her family, officials said on Friday.

Nauman Shahid, a resident of Toba Tek Singh around 200 km from province capital Lahore, had married Sana, a woman from his locality, last month without the consent of her family.

According to police officer Waqar Shoaib Qureshi, five people related to Sana’s family kidnapped Shahid when he was returning home on Thursday and tortured him severely before cutting off his legs and hands with an axe.

They left him on the road where passersby shifted him to a hospital. Shahid’s condition is very critical.

Qureshi said Sana’s cousins Muhammad Rizwan and Muhammad Shahid were arrested on attempted murder charge.

He said one of the suspects wanted to marry Sana. “When Sana contracted marriage of her own choice with Nauman Shahid, both the suspects kidnapped Shahid and took him to the village government primary school’s playground where they and three accomplices chopped off both legs and both arms of Shahid,” the offical saidf.

Qureshi said the suspects had managed to flee to Multan (350 km from Lahore) but the police traced them using their mobile phones.

He said a first information report had been registered against the suspects and their three accomplices.

41,2020/03/28,We are the world,"As living with COVID-19 becomes an everyday struggle, everyone sequestered at home is taking to podcasting

All conversations these days wind back to the one thing that’s on everyone’s mind and occupying all our news feeds: the virus. Yes, that one. Between frantically keeping up with the global numbers, finding ways to protect ourselves and others, it’s hard to find much mindspace for anything else.

The podcast space offers some respite from the high-pitched blame games on television and the sometimes confusing density of text. A search on listennotes.com for podcasts related to COVID-19 throws up some 174 results, most of which have been launched in March. There are also special daily shows introduced by regular broadcasters such as NPR and BBC (Corona Virus Daily and Corona Virus Newscast, respectively). Indian platforms Newslaundry and Suno India and mainstream news outlets too have dedicated substantial time and resources to episodes on the pandemic.

Take away

To cut through the sound clutter, here are a few shows that are worth taking a listen to. Even though these are U.S.-based, they’re plenty to take away for Indian audiences.

Don’t Touch Your Face from Foreign Policy, hosted by staffers James Palmer and Amy Mackinnon, launched on March 5 as a daily podcast that “tracks the crisis and explores what it means for people’s everyday lives.” The first episode in the series discussed the need for local solutions to the pandemic, and the importance of understanding local contexts even as we take lessons from what other countries are doing. Other episodes have looked at issues such as mental health (which is a popular theme recurring in other podcasts), conspiracy theories and misinformation, at-risk groups, and most recently (as of this writing), how media has covered the pandemic. In conversation with host Mackinnon, Roxanne Khamsi, science editor and former chief news editor of Nature Medicine, parses the nuances of coverage and where the media needs to be not only more careful in their use of language but also more critical of new research claims.

The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has become a reliable go-to site for many COVID-19 trackers, and their daily podcast, ‘Public Health on Call’, has since March 3 been addressing — in a comfortingly measured tone — some of the anxieties of the moment. Professors from the University weigh in on different aspects of the pandemic, from explaining what it means to “flatten the curve” to considering the human rights implications of restriction strategies.

Deep and fine

Epidemic, from Just Human Productions, launched a little earlier than the previous two, has infectious diseases specialist Dr. Celine Gounder engaging with invited guests on a range of issues related to the pandemic. Joining her on the podcast is Ronald Klain, former chief of staff to two American Vice Presidents (Al Gore and Joe Biden) who provides a macro-level planning and governance perspective. Despite the somewhat alarmist title of the podcast, the conversations provide “depth and texture” to the various questions that we are all asking, for instance, “Are the right people making the right decisions using the right science?”

Apart from these institutional podcasts, it would seem that everyone who is sequestered at home is taking to podcasting, as living with COVID-19 becomes an everyday struggle.

From staying-at-home teenagers in New York to families in Germany to working-from-home techies in Ireland, there are a number of experiential podcasts that tell us we are not alone in these anxious times.

42,2020/03/28,Goren Bridge by Bob Jones,"North’s leap to slam was a bold move. It’s the kind of bid one might make if his team is trailing near the end of a match. It might create a swing that leads to a comeback victory.

The easiest route to 12 tricks would be three club ruffs in dummy. West’s inspired trump lead prevented that. A 3-3 spade split combined with two club ruffs might also do it. Rather than just relying on that, South decided to see if dummy’s hearts could be established.

South won the opening trump lead with dummy’s 10 and ruffed a heart with the ace of diamonds. He ruffed a club with dummy’s low diamond and ruffed another heart, this time with the king of diamonds. Declarer crossed to dummy with the ace of spades and led another heart. When East discarded a club, declarer did the same, allowing West to win the trick. This was a good play, as South would have lost trump control if he ruffed. West exited with a trump, which South was able to win with dummy’s nine, thanks to his foresight in ruffing hearts with high trumps.

One more heart ruff established the suit. South drew the last trump and crossed to dummy with the king of spades to discard his remaining losers on the good hearts.

43,2020/03/28,Chennai’s fishmarkets are empty due to the COVID-19 lockdown,"With Kasimedu fishermen not heading to sea due to the 21-day lockdown, an unusual calm has descended on the city’s fish markets

“Look, a man has just got off a car and is coming towards us,” exclaims K Kalyani, while she is on the phone with me. She has a stall at the Nochi Kuppan fish market. “What do you want?” she asks the customer, and the phone line soon fills up with noise. Kalyani abruptly cuts the call. It is only fair that she pays more attention to her customers these days than waste precious time talking to a journalist. For, with the 21-day lockdown to break the COVID-19 chain, every customer who comes by is crucial to her business.

Minutes before, the 44-year-old was in a chatty mood. “At Nochi Kuppam, we have all come to a decision that none of us will get more stock,” she said. “We are allowed to sell what we have at hand, but not to buy more.” I spoke to her last week and she had some freshwater prawns to sell. Kalyani usually gets her prawns from Pulicat, but due to vehicular restrictions, she was forced to source the prawns locally. Customers too, queued up in front of her, unlike their usually disorderly selves. “The police have marked lines with kolam powder so that there is a distance between each customer,” she added.

Her colleagues have set up their stalls as well, but are running out of fish. “We bought stock from some fibreboats that went to sea,” she explained. “By the end of today, I will have nothing to sell and will have to close down my stall.” This is going to be a tough phase for people like her. “But it had to be done,” says R Mayandi, a Kasimedu fisherman who owns a line-fishing boat. “I’m not going to sea; with the yearly State government fishing ban on mechanised boats set to start on April 5, looks like it will take a long while for us to go back to sea.”

Fisherman Vinoth Kumar from Odaikuppam says that his and two other fishing settlements in Besant Nagar have decided to stay away from fishing during the lockdown. “I have closed my shop too. This is a decision taken voluntarily after discussing with fishermen here. We don’t foresee any demand, nor can we home-deliver due to movement restrictions.”

Kasimedu fishing harbour wears an unusually quiet look, according to MD Dhayalan, president, Indian Fisherman Association. “None of the boats are going to sea since we have been instructed by the Fisheries Department to not go,” he says. “Besides, all the boat workers are from Andhra Pradesh and places such as Thiruvannamalai and Gingee. They have gone back home.” On days before the Sunday curfew and the lockdown, people thronged the fish market at Kasimedu. He adds: “We got a good price too.”

44,2020/03/28,Dating apps see rise in users during COVID-19 lockdown,"It could be loneliness. Or it could be plain boredom. Either way, online dating apps are seeing a rapid rise in users, in these days of personal isolation

“I used to be on all the dating apps till about six months ago, when I gave up because I had lost hope and was bored with the others,” says Tarana Reddy, a film producer based in Chennai. “But last week, I had nothing better to do, so I re-downloaded Hinge, just to see what was going on.”

On it, she found others who, like her, were back on the app because their social lives and physical interactions are on hold as cities around the world are going under lockdown. And they aren’t alone — dating apps like Hinge, Bumble and Tinder are seeing an increase in new users across the board, as more and more people hop aboard to escape the confines of their homes. Existing users, too, seem to be spending more time and effort in looking for a connection.

While most apps are waiting to see how the trends shift and settle over next week, Tinder has a few country-wise insights, for mid-March: “Daily messages are up 10-15% compared to the prior week in the US. In places like Italy and Spain, we saw increases by up to 25% in daily conversation as compared to the week prior. Conversation length was up anywhere from 10 to 30% as compared to February in places like Europe and South East Asia,” says a Tinder spokesperson over email.

Quantity over quality

But longer conversations don’t necessarily mean better ones. As Tarana somewhat sardonically points out, just because someone is under lockdown, it does not mean they suddenly turn funnier or more interesting. “A couple of them have even come up with quarantine-related pickup lines,” she says, sounding distinctly unimpressed. Not surprising, considering the cringe-worthy ones we have come across, like, ‘Hey there, are you the vaccine? Because the whole world is chasing you.’

Funnily enough, Tinder’s top bios have also changed from the usual “wanderlust”- and “sapiosexual”-studded statements, to phrases like “stay home”, “be safe”, “social distancing”, “how are you”, and “wash your hands”.

Tinder is tweaking its features like Passport, which allows users to match with people in different destinations around the globe, regardless of where they are currently located. “Tinder’s Passport is currently available as one feature within Tinder Plus and Gold subscriptions. However, in the next iOS and Android releases, which we anticipate being around the end of March, the Passport feature will become free for everyone,” says a company statement.

In sharp contrast are the few users who don’t see the point of going online while isolating, no matter what part of the world they are in, since there aren’t high chances of it leading to a real date. Akshat Pradhan, a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is currently in isolation at home in Pune. “I will be in self-isolation for two weeks now. I was on Tinder and Hinge, but haven’t used it for the past week. I probably won’t be trying them for a month at least,” he says.

For the others, these dire times have not made the interactions any more ardent — just more sporadic and half-hearted, if Tarana’s experience is anything to go by. “I’m not the best at texting… I text when I am free, and if something comes up, I forget to. So the people I have matched with are getting a little passive aggressive about it. They say, ‘We’re under quarantine; how busy could you be?’”

Many, like Indian expatriate Payal Kohbragade, see these apps as a means for some much-needed change of pace. Payal, who moved to Germany in February and is now under lockdown with five housemates, says, “I don’t want to talk to the same people over and over again, like roommates and family. Talking to someone new on the app helps break the monotony of our repetitive lives.” Of course, some changes have to be accommodated, “We meet on e-coffee dates instead, through video chat.”

Her last real date was about a week ago, when they decided to take a stroll around a park instead of sitting at a café. “We wanted to avoid closed, crowded spaces, and also kept the minimal personal distance from each other throughout,” she recalls with a laugh.

Not all lovebirds feel jaded, however. A good example is the Love Is Blind Instagram page by New York-based roommates Thi Q Lam and Rance Nix. The duo, who have been trying to keep six feet away from each other in their New York apartment, are posting photos of various couples, who are keeping each other safe through social distancing even in the confines of their homes. And then there are apps like Quarantine Chat, which are enabling strangers all over the world to chat. Innovations like these are likely to keep coming up, since, as Payal says, “it just helps to talk to someone new.”

46,2020/03/28,State of efficiency: How Kerala has handled the coronavirus crisis,"Kerala’s response to the pandemic has been robust, efficient and humane. A look at all the things it got right

""Understand Kerala through Covid,” public policy professional Balakrishnan M. tweeted on March 20, with an image of two masked policemen on a bike carrying unusual items — a coconut spadix or flower and a big, green, braided coconut leaf.

They were on an errand. Like their counterparts in other parts of Kerala, Niraz K.T. and Umesh U.P., beat cops at Kasaba Janamaithri station in Kozhikode were checking on people placed in home quarantine. One such person was Anand Ramaswamy, a Dubai-based banker. His mother had died, and he urgently needed to buy some things for the post-funeral rituals. He could not step out and no autorickshaw would home-deliver anything to him. So, the two policemen pitched in, buying what he needed. Niraz says he has also been delivering medicine and food to other quarantined people who stay alone.

For Balakrishnan, the incident is illustrative of Kerala’s communal amity and people-friendly policing.

“Exceptional times call for exceptional thoughts,” said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a videoconference he held on March 25, a day after Kerala went into total lockdown. As he instructed officials to make elaborate arrangements to ensure everyone had access to food, medicine and healthcare, his instinctive crisis management skills were evident. Community kitchens, which had fed thousands during the floods, would make a comeback, he announced. And food would be delivered free to the needy.

The key to Kerala’s extraordinary efficiency during the pandemic is attention to detail. Meticulous planning has gone into food and medical care strategies, ensuring that they cover every section of the populace — from the elderly to low-income groups, from migrant workers to terminally ill people, from fishermen to farmers. Systems are in place to regulate public movement, freight transport and the movement of essential supplies. Home deliveries have been given a leg-up. Milma, the State’s milk cooperative, has launched a delivery app, while the State-run Horticorp is set to follow suit with vegetables. The Catholic Church offered its hospitals up for COVID-19 cases. District administrations have begun to take over abandoned private hospitals and other buildings with bath-attached rooms to function as care centres.

The first State to record a positive patient, Kerala also started tracking early on. Training for healthcare staff was going on and surveillance at international airports on January 23, as soon as alerts came in from the World Health Organization (WHO). The Kerala node of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) immediately activated district surveillance units.

Past experience

The State has drawn heavily on its experience of fighting Nipah. At that time, it had launched a contact-tracing exercise, which stood it in good stead now. Helpdesks were quickly set up at airports and passengers asked to fill declaration forms even before landing. Just as screening at airports was being ramped up, a couple travelling from Italy, which had by then become the epicentre of the pandemic, slipped through the net and reached Ranni in Pathanamthitta, triggering Kerala’s second wave of infection. “They were tracked down after a doctor questioned their neighbours who showed up with COVID-19 symptoms. It required a bit of hard talking to get them to hospital,” says Health Minister K.K. Shailaja.

The Pathanamthitta administration under collector P.B. Nooh launched a massive exercise to unearth patient clusters. They used Asha, Anganwadi and Kudumbashree workers, healthcare professionals and residents’ associations besides location-tracking technology to create spatio-temporal maps for retracing patients’ movements. “It was scaled up with the National Health Mission at the State-level to unearth contacts of those who defied home quarantine and tested positive,” says Dr. Amar Fettle, State nodal officer for public health emergencies. In north Kerala, police teams used geofencing to enforce quarantine.

As the days went by, Kerala’s surveillance net nearly burst at the seams — covering some 1.02 lakh people. Symptomatic cases were shifted to isolation facilities at hospitals across the State. The government launched a huge ‘break the chain’ campaign promoting social distancing, hand hygiene and work-from-home. Multilingual information material was disseminated everywhere.Companies, voluntary organisations, even prisons got down to making affordable sanitisers and masks and setting washbasins at busy junctions.

Nerve-centre

The State control room where 18 subdivisions — for surveillance, contact-tracing, transportation, testing, ambulances etc. — converge, became the nerve-centre. As Fettle explains, at each district control rooms, a ward member, an Asha worker and a police officer teamed up to attend to quarantined patients. Simultaneously, the State’s testing capacity was augmented, with four centres added (over 5,000 tests done so far), and the procurement of medical supplies was accelerated. In a single day, 276 doctors were recruited from the PSC rank list, with similar plans in the pipeline for paramedical staff. Importantly, to ease the load on healthcare personnel, they were divided into three alternating teams, so that each team could get enough rest. In addition, the government recently announced the creation of a war room at the State secretariat with a Principal Secretary at its helm and five senior IAS officers overseeing its operations in turn.

In a highly progressive move, 626 councillors were deployed to safeguard the mental health of the quarantined. A 24x7 Disha call centre was activated for COVID-19 with six lines, soon growing to 30 lines that had responded to and mapped 35,826 calls until 5 p.m. on Thursday.

The Chief Minister unfailingly held elaborate daily briefings each evening, sharing facts, figures, plans and concerns, using audio and video conferences with administrators and people’s representatives. The committee members and multi-agency officials communicate among themselves with Zoom video chat. “We’ve done rather well for a small State. There’s an open and dynamic relationship between a government that’s responsive to criticism, a society that’s aware, and the media,” says Dr. K.P. Aravindan, retired professor of pathology and former president of Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad.

Game changer

Public health expert Dr. B. Ekbal attributes it to the decentralisation of governance in 1996: “It was a game-changer for primary health centres up to district hospitals, whose governance was handed over to local bodies.” Under the 2006 government, this infrastructure leapfrogged, and under the present government’s Aardram mission, all healthcare facilities were given better hygiene and amenities. “If about 28% of people were using government hospitals between 1996 and 2000, it is 40% now,” says Ekbal. In all this, there’s enormous community participation. “We thus have the social capital to tide over the COVID-19 crisis,” he says. “We also have academic capital in the form of high-profile health experts.” The challenges for Kerala lie elsewhere: the high comorbidity of the population, the high percentage of the elderly, and the difficulty in asking a socially active population to confine themselves at home.

Just before the lockdown, Vijayan announced a relief package of ₹20,000 crore. This included arrears due to contractors, loans for Kudumbashree women, pensions for those not under social security schemes, a cumulative payment of two-month social security pensions, heavily subsidised meals and a rural employment guarantee scheme. “The fiscal package has sought to put money in people’s hands, addressing the critical question of demand. But the mark of this pandemic is that it has disrupted supply as well. If the crisis is prolonged, the State may have to chip in to take care of large chunks of manufacturing and production,” forecasts R. Ramkumar, professor of economics at TISS in Mumbai.

Is Kerala ready for what promises to be a long-haul battle? Vijayan is unfazed and says with characteristic calmness: “The government will be at the vanguard.”

47,2020/03/28,Telecom companies to opt for EMI moratorium,"Tariff will remain stable, says COAI

Debt-ridden telecom operators are likely to opt for three-month moratorium to avoid cash crunch during the lockdown, industry body COAI said on Saturday.

The telecom operators have spoken in favour of raising mobile call and internet rates at the earliest, however, they will keep the prices stable during the lockdown period, COAI DG Rajan S. Mathews told PTI.

“There is debt of around ₹1.6-2 lakh crore that telecom operators owe to Indian banks. They will opt for three-month moratorium in loan repayment to help them maintain cash flow. It is a relief for them,” Mr. Mathews said.

The RBI on Friday allowed banks to put on hold EMI payments on all term loans for three months, slashed the cost of fresh borrowing by cutting policy interest rate by steepest in more than 11 years and infused a massive Rs 3.74 lakh crore liquidity as it joined the efforts of the government to counter the economic fallout of coronavirus pandemic.

The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) also allayed fear of hike in tariff by the telecom operators. “Telecom companies understand market situation. They will keep tariff stable for now,” Mr. Mathews said. Telecom operators have been asking for fixing minimum tariff for call and data rates. Vodafone Idea has suggested that the minimum rates should be fixed starting April 1, 2020.

Mobile subscribers get access to 4G data at a price as low as Rs 3.5 per GB but if the floor price is fixed as demanded by telecom operators, mobile internet prices will rise 5-10 times from the current level.

Debt-ridden Vodafone Idea has proposed that the minimum price of data should be fixed at Rs 35 per GB, Bharti Airtel has proposed minimum price of Rs 30 per GB for low data users and Reliance Jio wants it to be hiked gradually to Rs 20 per GB.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/2h2tak/article31005669.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Vodafone-Idea-pGAL7798NB4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/telecom-companies-to-opt-for-emi-moratorium/article31194858.ece
48,2020/03/28,Net traffic rises by 30% post lockdown: COAI,"Sudden demand chokes networks

India’s Internet consumption has gone up dramatically as net traffic witnessed a 30% spike post lockdown, leading to a sudden choke in the telecom network across the country, said Rajan Mathews, Director General at Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI).

“We see a sudden and unprecedented countrywide spike in demand for bandwidth, especially after the lockdown, with millions of professionals started working from home and their children and other children playing online games, watching videos and movies online,” he told The Hindu.

Tech capital Bengaluru reported a huge, almost 100%, spike in net traffic, said top official of a telecom firm, who did not wish to be named.

Responding to a query on the need for additional spectrum, Mr. Mathews said COAI had asked telecom and internet service providers (ISPs) to individually approach the Department of Telecom for additional allocation of spectrum.

“It is up to individual telcos to ask for additional spectrum, depending on scientific reasons and economic viability. They need to be very specific why they need more spectrum, where they need and how do they justify their requirements. As of now, no real-time data is available on choke points, although there are a plenty of such points.”

According to Mr. Mathews, many a time, networks are close to crashing and therefore COAI had advised electronic content providers, OTTs and television channels to reduce the density of the content.

""We don't require high resolution content for basic viewing of news and entertainment, at least at this point of time, ""he opined.

As a word of caution from COAI, Mr Mathews said individual internet users, including kids, have a weighty responsibility towards reducing the current stress on telecom/internet networks.

“Customers must avoid live streaming, instead download videos and movies. This would ease the pressure on the networks. Behave responsibly and avoid unwanted uploads, downloads and social media forwards. Internet is the only cord that currently connects the county and allows us play and work, "" he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/net-traffic-rises-by-30-post-lockdown-coai/article31194637.ece

Following requests from the government, two of the biggest passenger vehicle makers in India — Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor — on Saturday announced plans to help scale up the production of ventilators, masks and other protective equipment in the country.

Market leader Maruti Suzuki said that it had entered into an arrangement with AgVa Healthcare — an existing approved manufacturer of ventilators.

”At the request of the Government of India, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) examined its ability to assist in the production of ventilators, masks and other protective equipment... MSIL would work with AgVa Healthcare to rapidly scale up production of ventilators. The intention is to reach a volume of 10,000 units per month,” it said in a statement.

Maruti Suzuki said while AgVa Healthcare would be responsible for the technology, performance and related matters for all the ventilators produced and sold by them, the carmaker would use its suppliers to produce the required volume of components and use its experience and knowledge to upgrade systems for the production and quality control of the higher volumes.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7nevr8/article30732911.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYUNDAIKB,https://www.thehindu.com/business/maruti-hyundai-motor-to-help-govt-with-ventilators-masks/article31194620.ece

52,2020/03/28,"Rise in TV viewership, courtesy COVID-19","197 million watched PM’s address, surpassing the 133 million viewership of IPL Finals

The work-from-home directive after the outbreak of COVID-19 has led to a jump in television viewership across the country.

As per the latest report by BARC-Nielsen India, the consumption of television content has increased by over 72 billion viewing minutes, leading to an 8% jump in the period from March 14-20 compared to the last three weeks of January. In urban India, the viewership in week 11 of 2020, around the time when companies announced work-from-home, was the second-highest since 2015. Viewership has risen by 8% among men, 9% among women and 20% among children.

The average time spent per viewer per day now stands at 3 hours 51 minutes, showing a 2% rise, as per BARC-Nielsen India data.

The growth has been driven by a 20% increase in daytime viewership at an all-India level. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s March 24 address on ‘complete lockdown’ was the most viewed event, with the number of viewers surpassing the IPL Finals (133 million), at 197 million. At ZEE, the non-fiction programming, award show based content and viewership of movies has increased. Time spent by children has gone up for (general entertainment category) GECs and movies by 28% and 26% respectively, ZEE executives said. Prathyusha Agarwal, Chief Consumer Officer, ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. said, “As the nation is coping with the COVID-19 outbreak and spending most of their time indoors, TV has been rendered the most sought-after companion to live through these unprecedented times.”

“We are witnessing a consumption spike with the average time spent on TV increasing sharply. With the mandatory lockdown in place, the entire family consumption of the TV has seen an above average growth especially amongst males and kids,” she said. Even there is a change in the viewing pattern, with children watching more movies and news apart from the regular kids content, she said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ch6ght/article31194595.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THBUHOME,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rise-in-tv-viewership-courtesy-covid-19/article31194596.ece
53,2020/03/28,Merger won’t lead to closure of even one branch: Indian Bank,"Lender will retain its name post amalgamation, says MD Chunduru

The amalgamation of public sector lender Allahabad Bank with Indian Bank from April 1 will not lead to the closure of even a single branch, Padmaja Chunduru, managing director and chief executive officer, Indian Bank, said.

“The amalgamation process is on and we have gone far in this issue. The amalgamated entity will be called Indian Bank,” she said.

According to Ms. Chunduru, regular customers may not see any visible change on day one. The change in signage and display boards at Allahabad Bank will be done after a few days due to logistics issue. She said that Indian Bank had wide presence in the South and lesser in the North, which was vice-versa for Allahabad Bank.

As of December 2019, on a pan-India basis, Allahabad Bank had 3,175 branches and the average business per branch was ₹116.80 crore. Indian Bank has 2,890 branches, including three overseas branches. The number of clients will increase to 11 crore. The amalgamation might see the merger of zonal offices in Lucknow and Kanpur to cut administrative costs, she said. “Our goal is to ensure that minimum services are not denied to our customers from day one. Since both banks are on the same technology platform we don’t foresee any problem,” she said.

On the impact of COVID-19, she said: “Our people have been working with minimum staff strength at some branches and others from home. We have contributed a day’s salary to the PM Relief Fund. Moreover, we have come out with five different loans for our customers.” “Customers need not have to come to the branches for getting loans sanctioned. It can be done online. Disbursements will also be done online. In the case of bigger loans, signing of documents has to be done physically at branches or at their place,” she said.

As only four days are left for the amalgamation, staffers are working round-the-clock and even during the weekend to see to it that the process goes through easily, another official said.

Meanwhile, an official of Allahabad Bank said the merger process could face a slight delay in the wake of the nationwide lockdown.

54,2020/03/28,ChPT acquires 67% stake in Kamarajar Port,"Both ports to operate as different entities for the betterment of exim trade

Chennai Port Trust (ChPT) on Friday acquired from the Centre 67% stake in Kamarajar Port Ltd. (KPL) for ₹2,383 crore making the latter its wholly-owned subsidiary.

“This agreement comes into force with immediate effect,” P. Raveendran, chairman, ChPT, said. “Our immediate focus is to utilise the existing capacity in ChPT to the maximum and carry out expansion in KPL. Our next target is to achieve cargo handling of 100 million tonnes in the coming years.”

Soon after remitting the amount, he said both ports would operate as different entities for the betterment of exim trade — KPL as corporate firm and ChPT as trust. Both ports would be in a better position to meet competition from private players such as Adani’s Kattupalli Port and Krishnapatnam Port. ChPT will continue to handle clean cargo such as containers, cars, liquid cargo, cruise and passenger traffic, while KPL will create additional capacity for all other types of bulk, dry and liquid cargo. “Our combined effort will be to maximise cargo throughput. For the past few years, ChPT has been handling over 50 million tonnes of cargo, and KPL about 35 million.

It will take at least 2 to 3 years to reach 100 million tonnes, due to COVID-19,” he said. “In ChPT, we can’t go in for expansion due to thick population, traffic bottlenecks and the ban on handling dusty cargoes such as coal and iron ore. KPL is already handling coal. Efforts would be made to speed up the Chennai Port-Maduravoyal elevated corridor,” he said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/chpt-acquires-67-stake-in-kamarajar-port/article31194570.ece

64,2020/03/28,"Coronavirus | With over 180 fresh cases in 24 hours, India shifts focus to hotspots","No change in testing strategy, says ICMR; Kerala reports first death in Ernakulam.

With 185 new cases and two deaths due to COVID-19 reported in the last 24 hours, the Union Health Ministry on March 28 announced a change in strategy with increased focus on high-disease burden hotspots across India. Working with the State governments, there will be intensified efforts to strengthen community surveillance, contact tracking and containment strategy, officials said.

There, however, is no change in testing strategy, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said.

Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry Lav Agarwal said details regarding high disease burden hotspots would be announced soon.

Dedicated hospitals

Considerable spikes in cases have been reported from Kasargod district of Kerala and Bhilwara in Rajasthan. Kerala also reported its first COVID-19 death after a 69-year-old man being treated for the virus died at Ernakulam Medical College Hospital.

“While social distancing and lockdown continue to be vital, our focus is also on setting up dedicated COVID-19 hospitals in every State, ensuring that there are adequate number of beds, ventilators and ICU facilities,” Mr. Agarwal told reporters.

“Over 17 States across India have already started work on identifying dedicated hospitals. As for the other States we are constantly engaged in discussion for earmarking dedicated COVID-19 hospitals,” he added.

Coronavirus | Global death toll crosses 27,000, over six lakh cases registered in 183 countries

The number of confirmed cases, according to data from the Union Health Ministry stood at 909 cases (862 Indian and 47 foreigners), with 819 active cases and 19 deaths so far. Maharashtra (177), and Kerala (168) have reported the highest number of cases so far.

870 active cases

Reports from State health departments put number of confirmed cases at 974 with 870 active cases. In addition to Kerala’s first fatality, Maharahstra, Gujarat and Telangana also reported one more death each, taking the nationwide toll to 24.

Uttar Pradesh now has 61 confirmed patients with 11 new cases while 28 new cases were confirmed in Maharashtra.

Twelve new cases were confirmed by the Karnataka Health Department, taking the total number of in the State to 76. Punjab has 38 cases, while Haryana reported 33 including 14 foreigners. Madhya Pradesh has recorded 30 cases, Jammu and Kashmir 20 with eight fresh cases, West Bengal 15, Andhra Pradesh 14 and Ladakh has reported 13.

The Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) beneficiaries have been allowed to take three month stock of medicines. “But we request CGHS beneficiaries who have long-standing ailments, organ replacement and long-term diabetes to stay away from health care centres and have a representative collect the medicines,” noted Mr. Agarwal.

He announced that All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi will now offer not just doctors but also nurses on-line training programs for management of COVID-19 patients. “Also AIIMS, Delhi has started a tele-consultation facility for doctors across India to ensure that uniform clinical care is offered to all COVID-19 patients,” he said.

Stating that all patients having severe acute respiratory illness are now being tested for COVID-19 as per the previously revised testing protocol, Head of Epidemiology and Communicable diseases at ICMR Raman Gangakhedkar said though the Council has picked up small numbers of people with ‘untraceable’ COVID-19 illness history “the numbers are few and we aren’t entirely sure of the contact and travel details that they are sharing with us.”

Speaking about the ICMR’s choice of Hydroxychloroquine ( as prohylactic for health care workers and those directly involved in care of COVID-19 patients) Dr. Gangakhedkar said: “This drug showed reduction in the viral-load when given to COVID- 9 patients in some international studies. It is at testing stage in India and should under no circumstance be used by the general public. Also no vaccine currently is at human trial level yet.”

Joint Secretary in the Home Ministry Punya Salila Srivastava, said migrant workers are a focus group to protect during this period. “We have asked all States to provide all possible support to migrant workers in the form of relief camps with adequate medical facilities etc. States have been also advised to set up relief camps along the highways for people moving on highways, including setting up of tented accommodation to ensure that these persons will stay in the relief camps till the lockdown orders are in place. The shelters are to be organised, keeping in view various precautions including social distancing, with adequate medical check up drives to identify and separate cases requiring quarantine or hospitalization,’’ she added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/25l12s/article31195395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SRINAGAR1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-with-over-180-fresh-cases-in-24-hours-india-shifts-focus-to-hotspots/article31195396.ece
65,2020/03/28,Kabul gurdwara attacker left a wide footprint,"He did small jobs in Bengaluru, Malaysia, Saudi and Dubai before joining IS

The man from Kasaragod in Kerala, who is suspected to be one of the three attackers who killed 25 Sikh worshippers in Kabul, Afghanistan, has been on the move since he was 16, taking up small jobs in Bengaluru, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Dubai before making his way to Afghanistan to join the Islamic State.

Meanwhile, the body of Tian Singh, the lone Indian killed in the March 25 attack, is expected to be brought to India on Monday, sources told The Hindu.

His body will be brought on one of the special flights expected this week to take out about 2,500 Afghan tourists and temporary visitors.

On March 25, his widow Rajeet Kaur and one son, Jagmeet Singh, had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for an early repatriation of his last remains, as all commercial flights had been cancelled owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sources said the government gave special permission to the Afghan embassy in Delhi to operate several special flights, the first of which flew to Kabul on Saturday, and also put in a request for the return of Tian Singh’s body. Two other children who are unable to travel from London have also tweeted an appeal for visas from the Indian High Commission in London and permission to return and “attend and perform the last rites” of their father.

A loner with no known friends in India, Muhammed Muhsin, 29, is said to have contacted his mother about nine months ago Telegram, when he was thought to be in Dubai, a senior official said. Muhsin, he said, had asked his mother to join a group called ‘Gentleman’ on the app. On March 26, she received a message from a Telegram ID, ‘@war3030’, that her son was dead.

One of his brothers confirmed to security agencies that the photograph of the attacker published by Al Naba, the propaganda wing of the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP), is that of Muhsin’s. The officials have claimed that though Muhsin was never on the radar of the police, the security agencies had noticed his father’s mobile phone number in a WhatsApp group created by Rashid Abdullah, alias Abu Isa, who led the group of 21 men and women from Kerala that had left India in 2016.

“While verifying the details of the members of the WhatsApp group moderated by Rashid, it was found that Muhsin was then in Dubai,” said the official.

The official said Muhsin dropped out of a government school in Class XI. He also went to a madrassa in Class VII.

He moved to Bengaluru to work in a hotel but returned after a year. He then moved to Dubai where he worked at Emirates Petroleum. On his return, he moved to Malaysia.

“He came back in 2015, stayed for a few months in Kerala only to move to Saudi Arabia in 2016,” the official said. He came from Saudi Arabia in 2018 and stayed in Kerala for four months. He left for Dubai the same year and did not returnHe last contacted his mother nine months ago.

As reported by The Hindu, the family did not inform the police that Muhsin was missing. Officials suspect he moved to Afghanistan from Dubai to join the ISKP.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/g6yf5a/article31195054.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEWS1-AFGHANGURUDWARA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kabul-attacker-left-a-wide-footprint/article31195055.ece
66,2020/03/28,"Coronavirus | Amid the exodus, a plea for food, medicine, transport","200 eminent citizens write to Centre to help out workers

Feeding centres, medical care and sanitised transport services are needed to provide immediate relief to the lakhs of migrant workers stranded on roads, said an appeal to the Central government signed by 200 academics, economists, social activists, lawyers, retired bureaucrats and concerned citizens. The sudden imposition of a 21-day lockdown, with just four hours notice, has had horrific consequences leading to a humanitarian crisis, it said.

“This decision, taken without proper planning, completely overlooked the disastrous impact it would have on 90% of our labour force,” said the appeal. “Many of them are stranded and starving in the industrial belts where they work. In the absence of any transport, many are walking hundreds of kilometres to their villages on a hungry stomach. Others, in desperation, are packing themselves in lorries, at the risk of contracting or spreading the virus.”

The letter urged the Centre to take immediate action and use the network of anganwadis, panchayat bhavans, government schools and colleges, railway and bus stations, community halls and other public buildings to set up feeding centres to arrange free cooked food, medical care and sanitation. It noted that the Food Corporation of India and the Central Warehousing Corporation have 585 lakh metric tonnes of foodgrains in their godowns, part of which can be used to feed the workers.

The Centre’s welfare package, announced on Thursday, included a doubling of ration allocations, but did not provide for migrants, most of whom do not have access to a ration card.

Congress and CPI(M) slammed the Narendra Modi government for the ill-planned nationwide lockdown and general unpreparedness in tackling the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in a series of tweets said the government was responsible for the “alarming” situation.

He posted a picture from Delhi of several hundred workers queuing up at a bus station, saying that “in this hour of crisis, our brothers and sisters should at least be given respect and support. The government should take concrete steps as soon as possible so that this doesn’t turn into another tragedy.”

He also urged Congress workers to help those who are walking many hundred kilometres back to their villages.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, “There are men, women and children who are walking as far as eastern U.P. and Bihar. We sent planes to bring citizens from Europe, why aren’t we organising transport to take the poorest and most vulnerable amongst us home? It is the government’s moral duty to help our fellow citizens in this time of crisis.”

Former Home Minister P. Chidambaram also flagged the government’s unpreparedness and said, “Back to villages in crowded buses or on foot has significantly dented the lockdown. It is another distressing example of the governments’ unpreparedness.”

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said, “Restrictive policies on testing enforced by the Centre tied State governments’ hands. Orders for protective health gear weren’t placed on time. Even now, focus of Centre is on promoting a personality cult & PR than on working closely with State governments and meeting their demands.”

Taking a dig at Union Information Minister Prakash Javadekar’s tweet where he posted a picture of himself watching the 1980s serial Ramayan on Doordarshan in his drawing room, Mr. Yechury questioned the absence of daily briefings on measures taken to curb COVID-19.

“Are the Union ministers only for watching TV serials in their living rooms?Accountability is at the core of our democracy. Elected leaders of the Central government must face the people and the press to answer their questions and take responsibility for the government’s actions.

68,2020/03/28,Coronavirus | Centre tells States to set up camps for migrant workers,"Disaster response funds can be used for shelters

As lakhs of migrant labourers and workers continued to travel on foot to reach their homes in wake of the 21-day countrywide lockdown, the Union Home Ministry has asked the States to “immediately set up relief camps” along the highways and conduct regular medical checks while observing proper social distancing norms.

The Ministry also issued an order authorising the States to use State Disaster Response Funds (SDRF) to provide “for temporary accommodation, food, clothing, medical care, etc.” to homeless people, including the stranded migrant labourers.

The SDRF is the primary fund available with the State governments for responses to notified disasters to meet expenditure for providing immediate relief.

The Centre contributes 75% of the SDRF allocation for general category States and Union Territories and 90% for special category States (northeastern States, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir).

The States have been advised to set up relief camps along highways including setting up of tented accommodation to ensure that these persons will stay in the relief camps.

69,2020/03/28,Coronavirus | Centre plans classes in distance mode,"Lessons of classes 9 to 12 to be broadcast on TV, radio channels from next week

The school break is almost over for students from Classes 9 to 12. The Centre plans to restart classes in the distance mode next week, with teaching via dedicated TV and radio channels in English and Hindi, Human Resource Development Secretary Amit Khare said on Saturday. Many schools have been shut since early March due to the pandemic, even before the countrywide lockdown was announced last week.

“We are planning to start the next academic year virtually. We don’t want students to waste their time and then suffer when the schools reopen. We do not know how long the shutdown will last. That is a health decision. But the next academic year may get compressed,” Mr. Khare told The Hindu on Saturday. “Many students are already studying at home during this shutdown, but this will allow them to do it in a structured manner.”

This means that the new academic calendar will begin as usual in April for classes 9 to 12, though the last academic year may have been somewhat truncated, with examinations postponed in some cases. In fact, the CBSE exams for classes 10 and 12 have not been completed.

“We have asked the NIOS [National Institute of Open Schooling] to create a structured programme for schools class-wise. It is being done along with NCERT [National Council of Educational Research and Training] using their syllabus,” said Mr. Khare, adding that while content has already been prepared for secondary and higher secondary students, work is also starting to prepare material for lower classes as well.

This material, available in Hindi and English, is ready for use by schools following the NIOS or the CBSE syllabus. However, for State boards, the bigger challenge is language. “We have offered DIKSHA [mobile app] to States as a platform to provide content in local languages,” Mr. Khare said.

DIKSHA is a mobile app for teachers, parents and students which already provides access to NCERT textbooks and lessons, following the regular school curriculum.

The HRD Secretary said the Tamil Nadu government has already approached the Centre, asking for time on the TV channels dedicated for this purpose. “If States are willing to produce the content in local languages, we can give them 2-3 hours on our channel as well,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ssqdjv/article31194603.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEWS1AMITKHARE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-plans-classes-in-distance-mode/article31194604.ece

71,2020/03/28,Coronavirus | Armed forces can set up special kitchens: Adm. Ramdas writes to Modi,"He added that it was essential to ensure that a lack of access to food did not allow more people to become “vulnerable by lowered immunity because of lack of nutrition at this critical juncture’

India is facing an unprecedented challenge due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the likes of which the country has not witnessed since partition, and the armed forces with units across the country should be roped in to “organise and provide food through special kitchens which they can set up and run near their current locations,” former Navy Chief Admiral L. Ramdas suggested in an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“The food stocks can be directly indented from the District Collector of the district in which the armed forces get so deployed. This will ensure that large numbers of our people will not have to either physically travel distances in search of food nor go to bed hungry,” he said in the letter dated March 27. “I am also confident that our armed forces are well equipped and trained to render any other forms of assistance that may be required,” he added.

Adm. Ramdas said despite several measures by Central and State governments, the 21-day ‘Lock in’ does “entail a huge disruption and loss of jobs to a large number of people” most of whom belong to the poor and marginalised sectors. It was essential to ensure that a lack of access to food did not allow more people to become “vulnerable by lowered immunity because of lack of nutrition at this critical juncture,” he stated.

Observing that he was aware that this would be an “unusual application of the provision to deploy armed forces as aid to civil power,” Adm. Ramdas said this suggestion was being made in the larger interest of the people. “Unprecedented situations call for unprecedented measures — and this measure may be treated solely in this spirit,” he stated.

Observing that jawans and their equivalents in the other two services also hailed from villages across India, Adm. Ramdas added that this initiative would be “well received and also evoke maximum participation”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/myn3qf/article31194318.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CRAMDASKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/armed-forces-can-set-up-special-kitchens-adm-ramdas-writes-to-pm-modi/article31194319.ece

The Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Saturday urged police forces in the country to act with restrain while maintaining law and order during the coronavirus lockdown.

The lockdown has left millions stranded, struggling to search for food and water, Amnesty International India (AII) executive director Avinash Kumar said in a statement. “Unfortunately for these people, a state machinery has become a larger threat than the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said.

This is “unfortunate” and the Indian government must ensure that “insensitivity and brute force be replaced by people-friendly measures in battling the pandemic”, he said.

Mr. Kumar said India should respect and protect the rights of those under quarantine and ensure that their basic needs are met, including adequate shelter, food, water and sanitation.

HRW South Asia director Meenakshi Ganguly too urged Indian authorities to ensure that everyone has access to food and medical care, and that the poor and marginalized are not mistreated or stigmatized.

“The Indian government’s responsibility to protect its people from the outbreak should not come at the cost of human rights violations,” she said.

Tens of thousands of out-of-work migrant workers are stranded with rail and bus services shut down in the country. “Police actions to punish those violating orders have reportedly resulted in abuses against people in need,” she alleged.

“Indian police should be ordered to act with restraint while enforcing the lockdown. In several States, photos and videos show police beating people who are trying to get essential supplies.

Mr. Modi had earlier on Saturday announced the creation of the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM-CARES), where people can contribute and help the government in the fight.

Taking to Twitter, Akshay said that safeguarding the lives of the people is of paramount importance right now.

“I pledge to contribute ₹25 crores from my savings to @narendramodi ji’s PM-CARES Fund. Let’s save lives, Jaan hai toh jahaan hai,” Akshay wrote in tweet on Saturday.

His wife, former actor and author Twinkle Khanna, praised Akshay for the step.

“The man makes me proud. When I asked him if he was sure as it was such a massive amount and we needed to liquidate funds, he just said, ‘I had nothing when I started and now that I am in this position, how can I hold back from doing whatever I can for those who have nothing,’” she wrote.

A number of celebrities have come forward to donate money so as to help people in crisis.

South superstar Rajinikanth was the first celebrity to come forward by donating ₹50 lakh to help daily wage workers.

Several A-listers from the south, including Prabhas, Mahesh Babu, Pawan Kalyan, Ram Charan and others have also donated money.

With Akshay Kumar donating ₹25 crore towards COVID-19 relief, hope was fuelled that more A list Bollywood personalities would now come forward with contributions.

“This is that time when all that matters is the lives of our people. And we need to do anything and everything it takes… Let’s save lives, Jaan hai toh jahaan hai,” Mr. Kumar tweeted, while pledging the amount to the newly formed Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM-CARES Fund).

His tweet came almost in tandem with the tweet from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s handle about the constitution of the PM-CARES Fund and his appeal to Indians to contribute to it. This Fund will also cater to similar distressing situations in future, the PM said.

Mr. Kumar was acknowledged for the “great gesture” by the PM.

Bollywood had been in the eyes of the storm for a while now for doing little for the cause other than making awareness videos, specially in the light of superstars from the South — Prabhas, Pawan Kalyan, Mahesh Babu, Allu Arjun, Chiranjeevi, Junior NTR and Ram Charan — contributing towards relief operations in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund.

GoAir on Saturday evinced interest in flying thousands of stranded migrant workers in various States to the airports closer to their homes amid the lockdown across the country, and said it has approached the government on this issue.

With both passenger train and flight services shut till April 14 and no source of income due to the closure of all businesses, these migrant workers are stuck in major cities and looking for means to reach their native places. Some of whom have been forced to even walk to their home towns and villages regardless of the distance.

Due to suspension of air services, the aircraft of all domestic airlines are grounded.

India’s millions of migrant workers are the most affected during the ongoing 21-day lockdown in view of COVID-19, the airline said.

“In response to their plight and after seeing scenes of workers trying to walk hundreds of kilometres home with their families, including children, GoAir has reached out to the Civil Aviation Ministry and offered its services to fly these workers and their families to the airports closest to their homes,” the airline said.

Azad Samaj Party chief Chandrashekhar Azad on Saturday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pushed crores of people working in the unorganised sector into destitution and demanded that he resign immediately.

He said the Central government failed to take appropriate steps even after the World Health Organisation declared coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic on February 5.

“When it should have been working on a plan to deal with the pandemic, the government was busy making arrangements for U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India and usurping power in Madhya Pradesh,” he alleged in a statement.

Mr. Azad claimed that the Prime Minister enforced a 21-day lockdown without proper planning and pushed 35 crore people who work in the unorganised sector into destitution.

“The government has left these innocent people to die. The Prime Minister should tender his resignation immediately,” the Dalit leader said.

The Bhim Army chief also hit out at the ₹1.7 lakh crore package announced by the Centre to cushion the people from the impact of the coronavirus lockdown and economic disruption caused by the disease.

The Centre announced a ₹1.7 lakh crore package which will only help those working in the organised sector, those who have documents and bank accounts. The benefit won’t reach around 37 crore people who are part of the unorganised sector, he said.

78,2020/03/28,Assam cops attacked for enforcing COVID-19 lockdown,"Mass violation of social distancing norms when markets were opened briefly

The police in Assam are finding themselves at the other end of the stick after allegedly using them to enforce the COVID-19 lockdown. On Saturday morning, a group of traders and customers attacked a police team in western Assam’s Bongaigaon district when they tried to close the shops at Bodi Bazaar. Two constables — one attacked with sticks and the other hit by a brick — were admitted at a local hospital.

A similar incident happened at the Phalimari Bazaar in the adjoining Dhubri district on Friday. Some 300 people who had gathered there in violation of the guidelines pelted stones at a police team that tried to make them go home.

“Our men fired a few rounds in the air to disperse the violent crowd,” Bongaigaon’s SP Singha Ram Mili said.

The police in the two districts registered FIRs against more than a dozen people involved in the assault cases.

The State government had on Friday relaxed the lockdown to enable people to procure essentials items, vegetables, fish and meat. But mass violation of social distancing norms across Assam made the authorities shut all markets almost immediately till further orders.

“We cannot back off from implementing the lockdown we have been tasked with. We will have to take action according to the law if people resort to violence,” said G.P. Singh, Addl. DGP (Law and Order) who toured the two markets on Saturday.

Officials in Arunachal Pradesh have accused the Assam police personnel of taking bribes from truckers transporting essential commodities to the frontier State.

In a letter to the Deputy Commissioner of Assam’s Lakhimpur district on Friday, an Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) of Arunachal Pradesh’s Papum district named two constables for holding up the trucks until the drivers allegedly bribed them.

Here's the full text of an urgent appeal by over 200 academics and professionals for providing immmediate relief to the migrant workers who are unable to reach their homes due to the current lockdown.

This is an urgent appeal for assistance to migrant workers who are unable to reach their homes due to the current lockdown – free food, medical care and sanitation at the very least.

Also read: Masks, hand sanitisers now under Essential Commodities Act

The sudden imposition of a 21-day all-India lockdown on March 24, 2020, at just 4 hours’ notice, has led to horrific consequences for many. This decision, taken without proper planning, completely overlooked the disastrous impact it would have on 90 percent of our labour force. Extremely disturbing reports of the plight of lakhs of migrant labourers in different parts of the country keep pouring in. Many of them are stranded and starving in the industrial belts where they work. In the absence of any transport, many are walking hundreds of kilometres to their villages on a hungry stomach. Others, in desperation, are packing themselves in lorries, at the risk of contracting or spreading the virus.

We make this urgent plea to the Central Government to pay heed to the situation immediately. The government must use the network of anganwadis, panchayat bhavans, government schools, government colleges, railway stations, bus stations, community halls, block offices, district headquarters etc to set up feeding centres to arrange free cooked food, medical care and sanitation. Foodgrains to the tune of 585 lakh metric tonnes are available in godowns of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and Central Warehousing Corporation (even before the wheat harvest). Some of it can be used to prepare cooked meals and/or take-home rations in these centres. This assistance should be available to all unconditionally, without any paperwork. This will still leave more than enough food in the godowns to fulfil the Finance Minister’s announcements and maintain adequate buffer stocks.

We also urge the government to immediately arrange for sanitised bus and train services to enable stranded workers to reach home safely. Others trapped at their distant workplaces must be assured of a secure living space with enough food, soap, sanitary pads and medical care. This is a national emergency and lakhs of people are in danger of perishing in hunger and trauma. We therefore make this urgent appeal for an immediate response to the humanitarian crisis, to prevent it from snowballing further.

The directions came amid reports that migrant workers are facing severe hardships while stranded at various parts of the country on account of a nationwide lockdown in the wake of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

“I have advised Chairman NHAI and Highway Concessioners/Toll operators to consider providing food, water or any kind of support to migrant workers/citizens who are trying to reach to their respective native places.

The Minister expressed hope that toll operators will respond to his call positively. Earlier, Mr. Gadkari had asked NHAI to suspend toll on all National Highways to ease transportation of essential goods and supplies.

The suspension of toll collection on National Highways will ease supplies of essential goods across the country while facilitating movement of patients and needy people who have obtained curfew passes, Mr. Gadkari had said.

Urging people to adhere to the nationwide lockdown, the Minister has said suspension of toll is for people who have to venture out for necessary travel.

“Even though it’s a complete lockdown all over the country, there are provisions to issue necessary passes/permissions for those people who approach the relevant authorities and convince their necessities to travel,” he had said.

Such passes are being issued by local authorities so that the needy people can travel, he added.

“Suspension of toll collection is for such people who travel in private vehicles. This will ease their journey without wasting time at the toll plaza. Toll collection has been suspended to reduce inconvenience to such people who have been issued curfew pass by local administration/authorities for all vehicles transporting essential goods and even the vehicles carrying patients,” the Minister said.

At the same time, he urged people to stay indoors and follow advice of local authorities to fight the spread of coronavirus.

The government earlier this week temporarily suspended toll collection on National Highways to ease emergency services in view of the coronavirus outbreak.

This will not only reduce inconvenience to emergency services but also save critical time, Mr. Gadkari had said.

Maintenance of roads and availability of emergency resources at toll plazas will continue as usual.

Earlier, the Road Transport and Highways Ministry had advised the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to follow the Home Ministry’s guidelines about toll plaza operations following the lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in the country.

Their stories are similar, their tragedies their own. Hundreds of workers, some accompanied by children, are on the move in both directions on National Highway-8, which links New Delhi with Jaipur. They are headed home — to Sawai Madhopur, to Ayodhya, to Kannauj — and they are walking.

The busy national highway has been taken over by these “pedestrians”, some of them talking on their mobile phones as they walk hundreds of kilometres to reach their homes, undaunted by distance. Apart from the odd vehicle on the highway, there are only cows to be seen.

Thanks to the lockdown imposed in the wake of the COVID-19 on Tuesday, large sections of India are on the move. On foot.

“We started walking this morning from DLF Phase-II [in Gurugram] and we have to reach our village in Sawai Madhopur district. It’s about 550 km away,” Narsing Lal told The Hindu. “We are construction workers, there is nothing for us to eat or do.”

Sant Raj, who is walking towards Neemrana, said he had gone to Delhi for a job interview. Accompanying him is Rameshwar, a security guard, and Rajesh Singh, a lab technician.

“I am never going to vote again,” Singh said, a resigned expression on his face. ""The government should have thought of something before they announced the lockdown in the country,” he said, a towel covering his face.

“What you are seeing now [pointing to the people on the Highway] in terms of numbers is nothing. At night, it’s a different scene, especially on the road from Faridabad. Thousands of people are going towards Bihar,” Rameshwar said.

At the main Manesar chowk, there are a bunch of men, women and children going to Kannauj in Uttar Pradesh. “No one thinks of us. They should have spared a thought for us,” Kiran, one of the people walking in the group, stated. “We have no choice but to go to our homes.”

A few kilometres ahead, a group of tired folks have stopped near a small pick-up vehicle, which is laden with bananas for distribution. It’s like a pit stop for the weary and hungry.

Making a U-turn from Manesar back to Gurugram and Delhi, the story is similar. A bunch of young men are busy picking up their small knapsacks, which contain their meagre belongings.

They have just been given food (and shade) by the kind staff at an Indian Oil Corporation petrol pump bang opposite the National Security Guard headquarters in Manesar. The men are headed towards Ayodhya as their roofing work in Bhiwadi, Rajasthan has wound up and there’s nothing to do there. No work.

“We don’t know what will happen now. This is the least we can do for them,” Ajay Singh, a burly security guard at the petrol pump, said, pointing to the young men he had just fed. Picking up their knapsacks, the men set off in the direction of Ayodha, not sure how long it will take them or when they will get their next meal.

Professor Adam Kucharski, who is an Associate Professor and the Sir Henry Dale Fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, specialises in the mathematical analysis of infectious disease outbreaks. This puts him at the very heart of the debate on the global coronavirus pandemic, especially its spread and containment and mitigation questions.

He spoke to Narayan Lakshman about what we can learn from modelling this and prior infectious outbreaks, including parallels to the spread of fake news. Edited transcript:

In your book, The Rules of Contagion: Why Things Spread – and Why They Stop, you talk about Ronald Ross, a British doctor who in the late 19th century discovered that mosquitoes spread malaria and was awarded the 1902 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. He was credited with applying mathematics, biology and an understanding of societal forces to predict the progression pattern of an epidemic. How can we apply that to the coronavirus pandemic today, specifically for predicting an endgame scenario?

One of the key insights that Ross made was regarding the control of infection. He won the Nobel Prize for identifying that mosquitoes spread malaria. But then he was really interested in using mosquito control to reduce malaria and ideally cause it to come to zero in a particular area. At the time, people had this idea that you couldn’t control malaria until you could remove every single last mosquito. Ross used these very simple, conceptual models though, thinking that if you have so many mosquitoes you have a certain probability of them biting someone, and that person might get bitten by another mosquito and then it spreads. He thought about these processes and realised that actually you don’t need to remove every last mosquito. Once you get the density of mosquitoes low enough, the chances are that someone who is infected would recover before they pass it on to others.

We can think of a similar idea with a lot of the physical distancing measures that are coming in. Initially, there may still be some infectious people out there, but because these measures are in place, they will have the infection and recover before they pass it on to someone else. There will still be some interactions occurring between the population, because you have key industries, healthcare workers and other such groups that do need to interact with other people. But because the level of interactions is particularly low, that can control the infection. That’s what we’ve seen in places like Wuhan.

One idea that you’ve explored in your work is the concept of “dependent” and independent” happenings, particularly in the context of identifying what an epidemic is, and its potential to spread fast through a population. Please talk to us a bit about whether we have too many “dependencies” today – for example, relating to hyper-urbanisation, transportation networks, communications via the Internet, and interlocking economies and finance – does that make the contagion effects associated with an epidemic far worse?

Those kinds of connections can certainly help amplify the effects we see of an outbreak. In terms of dependent and independent happenings, we might think of independent happenings as random accidents that occur, and they are not linked, and one thing doesn’t feed into another. It was again Ronald Ross who came up with the idea of what we call “dependent happenings.” What happens to you depends on what happens to other people. Obviously, biological contagion is a good example of this, but we do see these knock-on effects happening in other ways, for example the knock-on effect on economies when you have a financial crisis, and even in a biological outbreak like COVID-19. When you have that connectivity, what happens in a local area of China can quickly influence what happens in other countries. That is really a transition that we’ve had in the last decade or two. Even if you look at flight volumes out of China since SARS back in 2003, it’s about a three-fold increase. Potentially, what would have been a very small outbreak a few decades ago that wouldn’t have affected other places, now [affects] what happens elsewhere, such as the UK, the U.S., or India.

How, in terms of the mathematics of epidemiology, does COVID-19 differ from other major infectious outbreaks such as the Spanish flu, SARS or Ebola?

There are a number of broad principles that we can use to understand these infections. These can apply across a number of pathogens, particularly in understanding the magnitude of spread. So, each person who gets infected, on average, how many people are they giving the virus to? For COVID-19, it is about two or three. We can also think about the time scales: if you have one case, how long on average is it until the person infected then shows symptoms. For COVID-19, that’s about five days or so. So, you get this of time scale, which is probably doubling every five days, in terms of your outbreak.

The nuances of what is driving those numbers will vary between pathogens in terms of when the transmission is actually happening and what interactions are causing them. One of the big challenges or differences of COVID-19, as opposed to SARS or Ebola, is that a lot of transmission seems to be happening very early on in the infection, when people don’t have symptoms or have very mild symptoms. One of the reasons why infections like Ebola and SARS have been easier to control is that a lot of people who are highly infectious have very distinctive symptoms. That means you can identify them, look at whom they’ve come in contact with and make sure those people have been quarantined. However, for COVID-19, a lot of the transmission happens among people who might feel perfectly well or might have a slight cough, for example. That makes it very hard to pick up all the infections, and is why we’ve seen in many countries, even if they’ve been trying to detect cases coming in, many cases have managed to go undetected.

Yes, and this is what makes me worry about a country like India that has a relatively low number of confirmed cases and correspondingly fewer recorded deaths linked to COVID-19. Given the size and density of our population, does this seem a little suspicious to you, perhaps owing to the limited extent of testing? Or do you think maybe India acted fast in closing its international borders or something structural within its population has limited its spread?

I think in the early stages it is quite hard to untangle those two things, when you have a very small number of cases – is it just by chance or population structure or other features that mean that transmission hasn’t quite taken off yet? In Europe, we saw a lot of early transmission in Italy and that probably increased the chance that that country got hit before others. Once we start to get more severe cases, especially deaths, you can then start to get a clearer picture of how much infection you might be seeing. Deaths are obviously generally well-identified in the data. We estimate that about 1% of people with clear symptoms will have a fatal outcome for this. If you imagine that we have 100 deaths, we would really be expecting something in the range of about 10,000 cases. If you’re not seeing that in your data, then that suggests that not all symptomatic cases are showing up. I want to emphasise that it’s not just one or two countries that have this situation. We recently did some rough estimates and we think that many countries that have clear outbreaks now are probably reporting less than 20% of their symptomatic cases. That is partly due to testing and other logistical things. That situation is very common. But that does mean that it is hard to get a handle on the outbreak as it is now, because if you’re looking at deaths to understand what’s going on in your outbreak, those people who have died may have well been infected several weeks earlier. So, you’re really are looking into the past.

Listen: In conversation with top epidemiologist Jayaprakash Muliyil | The Hindu In Focus Podcast

Can you tell us a bit about the idea of herd immunity, the notion that over time a certain critical mass of a population will acquire immunity to a pathogen and that negates the need for universal countermeasures such as immunisation? Is this approach, which seemed to gain some currency in the U.K., applicable worldwide to the current pandemic? Or does it imply a death toll that would be politically unacceptable?

The concept of herd immunity goes back to Ronald Ross’ work on mosquitoes, and it is the idea that you don’t need to get your entire population infected to stop your outbreak. Once you have enough immune people, then when you have someone infectious, it is more likely that they will meet someone who is immune than someone who is susceptible and that will slow transmission without needing all of your population to be immune. That’s how vaccination works. We vaccinate a majority and that stops the outbreak, even though there are newborns and some [other such] groups that cannot be vaccinated. But as you say, for COVID-19, this can have a really severe impact on health systems, it can lead to a lot of fatalities. Having herd immunity presented as an aim really isn’t helpful and doesn’t reflect the situation we face.

In the U.K., there was this period of time where I was getting asked a lot of questions such as “Is the U.K.’s strategy just to sit back and let everybody get infected in the country?” That certainly wasn’t the strategy, as I saw it, and it wasn’t the modelling work that we’d been doing to provide some evidence about what the scenarios might be. It was very clear, if you look at the transmission of the disease, at its severity, that it was going to very quickly overwhelm health systems. I think we might be in a situation, especially in countries where it takes longer to slow down transmission, where infections will keep occurring. We estimate that probably in the hundreds of thousands of infections have now occurred in the U.K., even though we’ve only got a few thousand confirmed cases. This is a lot of infections, but it’s not enough to protect the population through this herd immunity mechanism. We could see some immunity-building in populations just because these outbreaks are happening, but I don’t think we should go into it with the aim of getting large numbers of people infected. If that happens in a short period of time, you’re very quickly going to overrun your hospitals.

Interestingly, you have also explored a pandemic that we have all learned to live with in the digital ecosystems of the 21st century – the surge of fake news. In India, like other countries, we have seen so much fake news in recent days relating to the coronavirus, including regarding unscientific treatment methods. Do you see any parallels between how fake news transmission happens and deadly pandemics such as COVID-19?

There certainly are parallels. One of the actual similarities is this: if you look at the individual level of sharing viral content online, it seems quite similar to the spread of COVID-19, in terms of individual steps. For COVID-19, on average, in the early stage, each case would give the infection to a couple of others. In a study of viral Facebook content, it was found that each person, on average, who shares a viral post, will lead to about two more people sharing it. But the big difference is the time scale. With COVID-19, it takes a few days for that transmission and that new infection to occur, whereas online we might be talking about 30 seconds. Very quickly, you get this much faster growth.

The other similarity between many of these infections is the variation at the individual level. As we have seen, for COVID-19, there have been some outbreaks where a single event sparks a large number of secondary infections. A lot of content that becomes popular online tends to have that feature too. We see messages spreading on WhatsApp, but often there will be some high-profile person online or some media outlet that will have sparked the outbreak and shared to a large number of people. Then, you see these smaller but secondary clusters of sharing happening. It is worth considering those elements as well. It is not just this idea that everyone is sharing with a couple of friends on a message group on WhatsApp, but it is often those more prominent organisations and people that are feeding into that.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tok6tc/article31190692.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FLdnBsF9400x400,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/countries-with-outbreaks-reporting-less-than-20-of-symptomatic-cases-says-uk-epidemiologist-adam-kucharski/article31190693.ece

90,2020/03/28,"Coronavirus | There was no leniency in screening for foreign travellers, ‘prosperous Indians’, says Centre","Centre refutes allegations that it was lenient towards foreign-return travellers.

India has been “proactive and preemptive, and graded” in its response to the COVID-19 crisis, the government said on Saturday.

Amid criticism that the three-week lockdown announced on March 24 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was without prior planning, the Centre released a timeline of its actions since the breakout of the global pandemic.

As lakhs of migrant labourers remain stranded without food and supplies in several parts of the country due to the lockdown, the government countered criticism that its response system was lenient towards foreign travellers. “…the statement that 'prosperous Indians' were allowed to return without screening, is preposterous. The government took swift action to put in place a comprehensive and robust system of screening, quarantine and surveillance are part of its robust response to the public health crisis right from the beginning. This covered every traveller, Indians returning after business, or tourism, students as well as foreigners,” the release by the Press Information Bureau said.

It said India acted much before WHO declared COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, to put in place a “comprehensive response system” at its borders.

“Screening of incoming air passengers followed by suspension of visas and and ban on international flights was much ahead of any other country,” the government said, pointing out that Italy and Spain, which are devastated by COVID-19, started screening of travellers after 25 days and 39 days respectively of first reported case.

“Though the first case of coronavirus was detected in India on 30th Jan., we had started thermal screening of incoming international passengers coming from China and Hong Kongs on 18th Jan itself,” said the release.

Screening of passengers at 30 airports, 12 major and 65 minor ports and at land borders covered over 36 lakh passengers, the Centre said. It had also started intensive coordination with the States. “A meticulous system has enabled States to track down individuals who tried to avoid surveillance or who did not not follow quarantine,” the government said, adding that 20 video conferences by Union Health Secretary with State Governments and six by the Cabinet Secretary with the State Chief Secretaries have been held to review the preparedness.

91,2020/03/28,Cong. calls for one-time transport for migrant labourers,"We are concerned about migrant workers walking on empty highways, says Ahmed Patel

The Congress on Friday asked the government to arrange for a one-time transport for migrant workers who have been forced to walk on highways.

Party president Sonia Gandhi wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “It is my earnest appeal to assist those who are trapped in transit,” she said, suggesting that State transport buses be arranged for these workers.

Ms. Gandhi also suggested that Collectors take care of those who could not afford to stay in lodges or guest-houses.

“We are concerned about migrant workers walking on empty highways. The Central Govt must issue a directive to enable one time train/bus service so these people can reach home. If we can evacuate Indians stranded in foreign soil why not assist those stranded on domestic soil?” Congress leader Ahmed Patel tweeted.

“The Congress President has also requested the PM, asking the Centre to issue guidance to allow authorities to assist those stuck in transit. We hope the Centre takes cognisance of the plight of those trapped immediately,” he added.

Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill also tweeted about the difference in the way the Centre treated NRIs and migrant labourers.

92,2020/03/28,"Amid COVID-19 crisis, South Asian University likely to get a boost soon","A new campus, earlier delayed, is expected to be ready this year and necessary officials will be recruited to run the multi-nation institute

South Asian University, the flagship educational institution of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), is likely to receive much required official attention in the coming weeks. A highly placed source in the university said a new campus which was earlier delayed is expected to be ready this year and necessary officials will be recruited to run the multi-nation institute which draws students from all the eight SAARC member-states.

“A full-time Indian president of South Asian University will be appointed as early as in the next few weeks,” said the source in the university, which was set up as an example of regional collaboration on the educational front among SAARC member-states.

Shut down till April 14

Responding to the COVID-19 crisis, SAU has shut down till April 14 and has postponed the entrance exam for the coming semester. The university has been in news from the beginning as it failed to offer a common course of history because of differences among the member-states and the university’s affairs were affected as India had preferred other regional organisations over SAARC after continued terror attacks from Pakistan during 2016, which led to the cancellation of the Islamabad SAARC summit. However the coronavirus crisis also opened a window of cooperation for SAARC as Prime Minister Narendra Modi initiated region-wise dialogue in a videoconference on March 15.

It is understood that some of that new found spirit of cooperation in SAARC will influence SAU. The university had been left without a full-time president after previous occupant of the post Kavita Sharma retired last year. The university’s new campus in Maidangarhi has also been delayed with some sections suggesting that the Ministry of External Affairs had not shown interest in completing the work earlier.

Health concerns

There has been health-related concerns about the suitability of Akbar Bhavan in housing hundreds of students along with dozens of faculty members especially in the backdrop of viral infections like COVID-19. Though a large part of the students have evacuated from the university, at least 200 remain in the building, sources said, highlighting the need for an early completion of the new campus spread across 93 acres. The students in SAU represent all the South Asian countries that are currently dealing with the coronavirus infection.

97,2020/03/28,Coronavirus | Concerns over privacy as details of air travellers are leaked online,"Privacy activists and lawyers say the issue remains serious, and that anyone being allowed to handle sensitive and private information must be sensitised.

The government’s efforts to monitor people advised quarantine for the novel coronavirus ran into privacy issues on Friday, after the database of hundreds of passengers who returned from “coronavirus affected countries” was leaked online and shared by social media groups. In addition, the government defended its newly launched pilot or beta version of a mobile phone application called “Corona Kavach” which uses the data of confirmed coronavirus patients to alert subscribers when they are in close proximity.

On Thursday, a forward of a list containing details of 722 passengers who arrived in Delhi between March 9, and March 20 (which was the last day of commercial flights), was received on a number of “WhatsApp” and “Facebook” groups, who forwarded it further. The list included names, passport numbers, flight details, mobile phone numbers and addresses of all travellers.

“I find it worrying that our information has leaked,” said one of the passengers who lives in a South Delhi colony and was listed along with details of his wife and children. (name withheld on request). “This includes personal information that could be used for identity theft, and there is the concern that anyone on the list will be vilified. I hope there is an inquiry into how such information leaked.”

The Hindu contacted several government agencies that passed on the blame to other agencies for the leak. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said this information comes under the Bureau of Immigration, which comes under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). The MHA declined comment but an official said the information had been collated for the Ministry of Health.

Subsequently, after enquiries were made, it emerged that the Ministry of Health had released the data to the Delhi government, which also declined to respond to queries. However, a senior government source said they had narrowed the leak down to specific Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) who had access to the lists of their areas.

“We are now making a special appeal within departments not to forward these lists unnecessarily,” said the government source, while adding that it must be recognised that “there are multiple stakeholders in the system that need the list in order to monitor each case.”

The source said more than 15 lakh people have been screened at Indian airports, of whom 70% had been routed through Delhi, and that the leaking of a few hundred names should be seen in that context.

But privacy activists and lawyers say the issue remains serious, and that anyone being allowed to handle sensitive and private information must be sensitised.

“It doesn't matter whether 700 names are in the list leaked or 7,000,” said Research Director at the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy Arghya Sengupta. “Apart from the threat of violence, these details make each person on the list vulnerable to a number of crimes, like online fraud, electronic impersonation or identity theft,” he cautioned.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Electronic and Information Technology’s (MeitY’s) test-release on March 23 of an app designed to track the location of COVID-19 infected people and alert subscribers when they come near their locations has also raised some red flags.

The “Corona Kavach”, whose beta app has already been downloaded by more than 100,000 people, will require all COVID-19 patients to mandatorily download the app to track their whereabouts.

“If the government plans to forcibly make coronavirus patients download this app, it will have to show under which law they are acting, and that law cannot be a general purposes law, like Section 144; it will have to show specific powers. If the government is acting without lawful authority, it could be taken to court over this,” Delhi-based lawyer Prasanna S. told The Hindu.

However an senior official in the MeitY said the app could only work with the concurrence of the COVID-19 patient, and there would be no use of force.

“We want to assure that there will be no breach of privacy,”the official told The Hindu, adding that no name and exact location will be disclosed via the application. “This has to be done using the patient's phone and will only be possible if the person’s location data option was on and stored on the phone,” the official added.

98,2020/03/28,Kerala man was among Kabul gurdwara attackers,"Mohsin left for UAE two years ago

A man from Kasaragod in Kerala is said to be one of the three terrorists who stormed a gurdwara in Kabul on March 25 and killed around 25 Sikh worshippers, a senior government official told The Hindu.

The official said at least three terrorists of the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP) had attacked the gurdwara. All were killed by Afghan security forces. “We know that at least one of them is an Indian, and the identity of the other two is being ascertained,” the official said.

The attacker was identified as Abu Khalid Al-Hindi by Al Naba, the ISKP’s propaganda wing. The magazine published a photograph of the Indian attacker. The other aliases used for him were Abdul Khayoom and Abdul Khalid.

The official said the person was identified as Mohsin from Thrikaripur in Kasaragod. He was 29 years old and a school dropout. His family has moved to Kannur. He left for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) more than two years ago.

Mohsin’s family did not file police complaint

His family had never reported this to the police, a senior government official told The Hindu.

“His family never reported to the police or filed any complaint... They claim he was not in touch with them all these years... We are ascertaining the entire chain of events,” the official said.

The official said the attacker’s movement to Afghanistan was not clear yet. “We know that he left home more than two years ago under the pretext that he was going to the UAE. After that, when and how he reached Afghanistan to join the ISKP [Islamic State in Khorasan Province] is not known. The investigation is on,” the official said. There is no police case registered against Mohsin yet.

At least two officials confirmed that he was not part of the group of 21 men and women from Kerala that had left India in 2016 in batches to join the ISKP. Mainly comprising defectors from the Tehrik-i-Taliban (TTP), the ISKP came into existence in 2015.

The official clarified that another engineering student from Kerala also named Mushin was killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan in July last year. His family had registered a complaint at the Changaramkulam police station in Malappuram district in October 2017 stating that he was missing. He went to Dubai in 2017 after which he slipped to Afghanistan.

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) condemned “the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack”.

“The members of the Security Council expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the Government of Afghanistan and they wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured. The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security,” the UNSC said in a statement.

The members of the Security Council underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice, and urged all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with the Government of Afghanistan and all other relevant authorities in this regard, UNSC said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hqodsp/article31186641.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ABDUL-KHAYOOM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala-man-was-among-kabul-gurdwara-attackers/article31186642.ece

J&K government spokesman Rohit Kansal said two of the six positive cases had history of travel abroad and the other two had gone outside J&K as a part of religious congregation.

“Around 5,763 travellers and persons in contact with suspected cases have been put under surveillance. Five reports are still awaited,” said an official.

One person associated with the religious group Tableeg-i-Jamaat died on Thursday in Srinagar. Five of his contacts have already tested positive and many more are in various quarantine facilities in Kashmir.

Two more positive cases were confirmed from Rajouri district in Jammu. “One is a family member of Thursday's confirmed case, the other has a contact history with a confirmed (now deceased) case,"" said J&K government spokesman Rohit Kansal.

“People associated with the Jamaat are living in certain mosques in Pulwama after returning from various places, which puts these mosques at the risk of spreading infection. Such mosques are therefore declared administrative quarantine centres,” Deputy Commissioner, Pulwama, Dr. Raghav Langar said in an order.

PDP deplores police action

A day after the J&K police filed 38 First Information Reports (FIRs), seized 547 vehicles and sealed shops for violation of the lockdown, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) expressed its dismay.

“All efforts to check the spread of the virus is appreciated, but beating up, humiliating and torturing people on the pretext of enforcing lockdown must be viewed seriously. Especially in Kashmir, government employees engaged in essential services, including doctors, were allegedly harassed and beaten,” said PDP spokesperson and ex-legislator Firdous Tak.

He said there should be a visible difference between lawbreakers and enforcers. “Nothing permits a police personnel to take the law into his own hand and resort to inhuman and shameful methods. A humane approach is need of the hour,” Mr. Tak added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ubbbu4/article31101851.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Srinagar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/six-more-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-jk/article31188074.ece
100,2020/03/28,Coronavirus | Indian seafarers stranded in Iran due to global shutdown,"Trainee seamen are stuck on boats without money.

Among the over 250 Indians stranded in coronavirus-hit Iran are fishermen and seafarers. Many of these seafarers are trainee ratings, who have been marooned in boats abandoned by the owners in ports such as Khorramshahr, Bandar Mahshahr and Bushehr. The Iranian crew in the boats have left for their homes.

The abandoned vessels are practically dead ships with no power or fuel. The trainees who can’t leave the port are making do with whatever supplies they can muster and keeping their spirits alive. Many say they have received no medical attention though none of them has shown any visible symptoms of COVID-19.

Coronavirus | Government should help stranded Indian pilgrims in Iran, says Supreme Court

For many of these trainees, the 12-months they serve on the small Iranian ships — practically boats that ferry loose cargo from Dubai and back — will enable them to become certified seamen in India. Many have foregone salaries and some have put up money to agents in India to serve as trainees and become full-fledged seafarers so they can make a career in the merchant navy.

Some of them have completed 12 months but have been unable to leave.

Their owners have told them to stay in abandoned boats until the situation improves.

Snehit Barathe from Pune completed his 12-month training on March 5 on the ship Yekta that was transporting tyres, car parts and so on between Dubai and Abadan in Iran. But his owner has told him to stay on in an abandoned boat in Khorramshahr. “We are six here on this ship. There is gas in the boat that we are using to cook. Until a week back the market was functioning but everything is under lockdown now,” he says.

Many have been stranded longer. Hemchandra Pokhariyal from Nainital in Uttarakhand finished his training in January 15. He continued to serve in a ship until his salary was settled. “I had a ticket for March 4 to come back to India but the lockdown started here. Since then I have been living in an abandoned boat,” he says.

“We are managing with qaboos (Iranian bread) and rice,” says another stranded trainee Ajay Pawar.

Anurag Chand says some 50 Indian seafarers have taken shelter in the abandoned boats at the Khorramshahr port. “We help each other out with food,” he adds.

Not accounted

The exact number of such stranded seafarers is not known. A list created by Sanjay Parashar, Chairman of the International Maritime Federation, has the details of some 70 seafarers but he estimates hundreds of such Indian seafarers are in trouble in Iran.

The Indian Embassy in Tehran has so far counted some 150 stranded Indian seafarers. “We have advised them to not sign off and stay with their owners/vessels. We have been able to help in sending back eight who signed off. We do not have information of them being abandoned by owners,” says an official at the Embassy. He cites strict lockdown rules that include heavy fines of up to 5,000,000 rials as constricting any effort to reach out to them.

Desperate fishermen

Recently, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had taken up the issue of stranded fishermen with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The fishermen have been confined to small spaces and are living under poor conditions without proper food or medical care,” says Mario Johnson, advocate at the Madras High Court and co-ordinator of Tamil Fishermen Confederation.

The Embassy official said despite large distances and poor connectivity, they have provided essential food items at great cost to all the 1,029 Indian fishermen in Bushehr and Hormozgan provinces within a span of 24 hours on March 20-21, 2020.

“These include 744 fishermen from Tamil Nadu, 215 from Gujarat and 70 from Kerala. The places inhabited by the fishermen are either islands or ports and spread over a geographical area of around 300 km. The supplies were arranged despite considerable logistical challenges such as inter-province lockdown and extended holidays due to Nowruz (Persian New Year), “ the official says.

“We have been counselling the fishermen of the lockdown in India and cooperation of all people also and hence [the need] for them to stay put and take adequate precautions, follow all health protocols and cooperate with their owners by resuming work,” he adds.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/j4p678/article31187814.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200327-WA0084,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-indian-seafarers-stranded-in-iran-due-to-global-shutdown/article31187815.ece

103,2020/03/28,Warden suspended for ‘instigating’ people,"He reportedly made villagers oppose the setting up of a shelter for labourers

Srikakulam Collector J. Nivas suspended a warden named G. Venkata Naidu who reportedly instigated people to oppose the establishment of a temporary shelter for migrated labourers at the ST Hostel at Palakonda in Srikakulam district.

To prevent people from going from one place to another during the ongoing lockdown, the district administration had identified the hostel as a shelter for labourers of Prakasam district. Naidu, who reportedly wanted to skip the responsibility of running the hostel, had reportedly goaded locals to oppose the move on the grounds that some of the labourers might be carriers of the dreaded coronavirus.

After a thorough inquiry, the Collector suspended Naidu and said that dereliction of duty and mischievous acts would invite stringent action.

The Collector urged people to cooperate with police, revenue and other departments and expressed concern over the attacks on police personnel in different places when they tried to restrict unnecessary movement of people. A police constable reportedly sustained injuries at Kotabommali during a tussle with locals.

Mr. Nivas and Srikakulam Superintendent of Police R.N.

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the AP State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) has ‘distanced’ itself from people but only to share the government responsibility in this hour of crisis.

The prevailing lockdown in the aftermath of the outbreak of the contagious virus has confined people to their homes. However, the State machinery and the medical authorities are working round the clock to keep people apart and to treat those afflicted with the virus, respectively.

The APSRTC is plying its buses for various purposes like transport of vegetables from farms to the markets in Anantapur and Chittoor districts and moving essential services in Vijayawada, Tirupati and Anantapur towns. “We have deployed eight buses for the purpose in Vijayawada and five each in Tirupati and Anantapur towns,” said Brahmananda Reddy, Executive Director (Operations) of the APSRTC.

105,2020/03/28,Chittoor police mount vigil on inter-State borders,"1,500 fishermen belonging to Andhra Pradesh sent back to Karnataka

The Nangili episode of Andhra Pradesh fishermen trying to cross into Chittoor district from Karnataka on Friday has made the police to intensify vigil along the inter-State borders with Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

The police and district officials heaved a sigh of relief after sending back over 1,500 fishermen of North coastal Andhra districts to their respective workstations in Karnataka on Saturday, after consultations at the State level. The fishermen in large numbers reached the inter-State border at Nangili, 15 km from Palamaner, leading to a tense situation. Officials of Chittoor and the neighbouring Kolar district in Karnataka were engaged in hectic discussions through the early hours of Saturday.

In the backdrop of this development, the police stepped up surveillance along the border with Tamil Nadu from Satyavedu in the eastern mandals to Kuppam in the west. The borders with Chickaballapur and Kolar of Karnataka have also been put under strict vigil. Hundreds of migrant workers from the border towns and villages of Nagari, Puttur, Satyavedu and Nagalapuram regularly move to and from various places of Tamil Nadu.

A 45-year-old man, a resident of Puttur town, who works at a hotel in Chennai created a flutter on Friday night when he reached home during the lockdown period. As the neighbours noticed him coughing and sneezing, he was questioned and made to leave the locality. However, the police intervened and pacified the neighbours by sending the man to quarantine at a Tirupati hospital.

Deputy SP (Puttur) D. Muralidhar told The Hindu: “A large number of workforce from Nagari and Puttur towns and other villages of the border areas earn their livelihood doing odd jobs in Tamil Nadu, visiting their places here periodically. As there is a possibility of the stranded workers entering the district, we have tightened surveillance at the border check-posts.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/chittoor-police-mount-vigil-on-inter-state-borders/article31195294.ece

108,2020/03/28,Village volunteers’ system helped track foreign returnees : Balineni,"‘All 14 persons with suspected symptoms of COVID-19 tested negative’

The door-to-door survey undertaken by utilising the 2.5 lakh village volunteers’ network has proved effective in tracking the foreign returnees, which will help contain the spread of COVID-19, according to Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy.

“The working of the village volunteer system has been taken note of by other States as the YSRCP government is able to limit the number of positive cases (13 so far) when compared to them,” he told the media here on Saturday.

The volunteers, who act as a bridge between the government and the people in their jurisdiction that comprises 50 households each, tracked down a whopping 10,000 foreign returnees, the Minister explained while reviewing the health situation in Prakasam district, where a person who returned from London had tested positive for the disease. “This is in addition to the number of persons with foreign travel history identified by the Centre,” he said.

109,2020/03/28,"Ensure free movement of labour, demands farmers’ association","Labour shortage will lead to crop loss, they say

The Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA) said that the farmers in the country are facing hardships due to the 21-day lockdown imposed in the country as a response to COVID-19 pandemic.

The secretary-general of the Consortium, Bojja Dasarath Rami Reddy, has written to the Prime Minister detailing the issues currently being faced by the farmers on Saturday.

According to CIFA, there is a labour shortage as the villages are being barricaded. They suggested immediate removal of all barricades and make sure that labour has free movement across villages.

They also warned the government that there could be a huge crop loss if the labour is not allowed to move freely as produce would not be harvested. Moreover, they claimed that local law enforcement has also been “harassing” farmers while transporting labour from neighbouring villages.

As the authorities continue to clamp down on autorickshaws, the CIFA asked the government to provide special buses to facilitate the safe movement of labour.

CIFA also complained that pesticides and fertilizers are not widely available. “The fertilizer and pesticide shops are being closed by the local law enforcement only to be opened as soon as the police leave,” claimed the consortium.

They implored the government to make sure that shops are kept open, and also to make sure that fertilisers are delivered to the farmers at their doors to avoid the need to towns on a large scale.

“There is a difficulty in marketing perishable goods such as vegetables due to non-availability of transport,” said CIFA. They explained that though Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments have already announced that the produce would be purchased directly from the villages, a comprehensive policy is required.

They also asked the government to declare a moratorium on the loans disbursed to the farm sector for one crop season, similar to the moratorium declared on the working capital loans taken by companies. CIFA also asked the government to provide interest-free loans for the next farming season to facilitate easy access to capital and prevent loan sharks from taking undue advantage of the farmers.

Lastly, the requested the government to provide an insurance cover of ₹50,00,000 to each farmer and farm labourer.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ensure-free-movement-of-labour-demands-farmers-association/article31195164.ece

111,2020/03/28,Some drugs increase vulnerability to COVID-19: expert,"‘ACE inhibitors should be discontinued for three or four weeks for heart patients’

The heightened vulnerability of diabetics and hypertension patients that use ACE (Angiotensin-converting Enzyme) Inhibitors notwithstanding, persons who had a heart attack or heart surgery recently should protect themselves from COVID-19, said interventional cardiologist P. Ramesh Babu.

Two classes of drugs — ACE inhibitors and angiotension II receptor blockers — are under scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic. They reportedly increase the number of receptors the virus requires to get into the body. To invade a cell, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or COVID-19 latches onto a protein (receptor) called angiotensin-converting enzyme II, or ACE II. This protein is found on cells in the lungs, allowing the virus to invade these cells and cause respiratory symptoms. But ACE II also is on heart muscle cells and cells that line the blood vessels.

While good alternatives were available, the ACE inhibitors should be discontinued for three or four weeks so that the number of receptors to come down and the vulnerability to coronavirus also comes down, Dr. Ramesh Babu said.

Dr. Ramesh Babu said hydroxychlorquine should not be used as a prophylactic.

‘Break the cycle’

Dr. Ramesh Babu said that people should stay at home to break the cycle as there were several things that were not known about the virus. Though these viruses were not as virulent as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), they were known to mutate. There were known to mimic the properties of the host cells so that the antibodies do not perceive them as a threat, he said. These primitive life forms demonstrate tremendous intelligence and therefore the best way was to prevent their spread, he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/some-drugs-increase-vulnerability-to-covid-19-expert/article31194852.ece

Even as the lockdown necessitated by the spread of COVID-19 made the unorganised workers go jobless and the absence of food outlets forced people to starve, good Samaritans in various forms came to their rescue to meet their requirements.

Several charitable and social organisations have come forward to donate whatever is required, right from food packets to buttermilk sachets, masks to sanitisers.

On one hand, they are streamlining crowd, managing logistics and distributing essentials to the destitute people, while on the other, the constables and home guards are the receiving lot, as social activists prepare breakfast and supply them in packets along with water bottles to them.

Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), under the banner of its social service arm ‘Seva Bharati’, distributed food packets to urchins and alms seekers on the roadside at Anna Rao circle.

The members also gave water bottles to policemen on duty. Similarly, a local cloth merchant gave parcels of home-cooked food to the homeless living in and around Sridevi Complex on Tilak Road.

Meanwhile, the medical fraternity has agreed to extend services in tackling the COVID-19. Private doctors, who have so far stayed or been kept away from the process, volunteered to do their mite.

They have collectively decided to use a private hospital, located somewhere on the city outskirts, to be used as an isolation-cum-treatment centre. “We have agreed to the proposal by Collector N.Bharat Gupta to get ready an isolation and treatment facility by private doctors. We are ready to extend our services, if the government provided sanitary and personal protective gear to us”, said D.

The SP has asked the over 4,000 police personnel on duty at the grassroots level not to lose temper while enforcing the lockdown and warned of action against erring personnel.

Public need not panic as arrangements had been made to provide all essential commodities between 6 am and 1 pm every day during the lockdown period, the SP said.

Emergency services like hospitals, medical shops etc. would be available 24/7, he said and wanted people to contribute their mite in keeping the surroundings clean, avoiding crowding in public places and wearing masks while coming out in case of any emergency.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sp-apologises-for-misbehaviour-of-personnel/article31193974.ece
115,2020/03/28,Jammalamadugu panics over COVID-19 suspect in Nossam,"7 villages in Peddamudiyam mandal declared as ‘red zone’

The spreading of news over the identification of a migrant worker with COVID-19 symptoms near Jammalamadugu has become a cause of fear for the residents of this town bordering Kurnool district. Though the worker has been isolated and being diagnosed for cold and fever, it is not yet confirmed if he has tested positive.

The case has its roots in Nossam village, where the male suspect lives along with his fellow workers. He is learnt to be a part of a 70-member group of migrant workers from Rajasthan hired by a local railway contractor for some work in the vicinity. Though Nossam technically falls in Kurnool district, the residents of this cluster regularly visit the nearest major town Jammalamadugu, 16 km away, for their trading and recreational activities.

Rajasthan workers

The issue saw light after the suspect, along with some of his co-workers, was found to have visited his home town in Rajasthan and returned to Nossam via Secunderabad just before the lockdown was announced. When he visited the local PHC with a complaint of fever, the doctors referred him to the Kurnool General Hospital to be doubly sure.

Police identified and swooped down on 24 of his co-dwellers and shifted them to the quarantine centre in Proddatur. “We have marked the seven villages in the bordering Peddamudiyam mandal as a ‘red zone’ for enumerating the residents in the neighbourhood and also for enforcing a tight vigil to restrict inter-district movement,” Deputy Superintendent of Police N. Nagaraju told The Hindu.

Even as the test result of the sample sent to SVIMS, Tirupati is awaited, Jammalamadugu continues to remain in gossip and panic mode.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jammalamadugu-panics-over-covid-19-suspect-in-nossam/article31193936.ece
116,2020/03/28,State intensifies vigil after HC directions,"Interim measures to be in force for a month

The Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) government has intensified the vigil on the streets to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as the High Court (HC) issued certain directions as an interim measure by taking cognizance of the matter on its own. Chief Justice J.K. Maheswari and Justice M. Satyanarayana Murthy ordered that the directions should be in force for a month from March 26.

The most significant of the 14 directions issued by the court is not to allow any mass gathering on the State boundaries of both A.P. and Telangana and that officers of both States should follow the national protocol thereof or otherwise related to transportation of the public, quarantine and the conduct of necessary tests and to take due care of women with children and pregnant women.

The court directed the government to ensure the availability of N-95 masks, sterile gloves, starch apparels, PPE and other essential items to doctors and paramedics and to take steps for the maintenance of social distance between the children in remand homes.

All stay orders extended

Another important direction is that all cases in which interim orders were passed by the HC and the district courts, civil courts, family courts and labour courts and industrial and other tribunals over which it (HC) has the power of superintendence and the stay has expired two weeks prior or is due to expire within one month, will continue to be in operation for a further period of one month.

Bails and suspensions granted in criminal cases (anticipatory or regular) likely to expire within one month will be extended for a further period of one month.

Tenders not finalised should not be given effect for one month and the process may be resumed after the end of lockdown.

Confidential

The HC further ordered that the information related to patients undergoing health check-up should be kept strictly confidential and poor patients not be discriminated.

Besides, the marginalised and poor be given access to health care and food provided so that they do not sleep with empty stomach at night.

Priority is to be attached to providing adequate facilities to police, doctors, paramedics and others engaged in COVID containment and steps to be taken for curbing the spread of the virus at Kakinada, Visakhapatnam and Krishnapatnam ports.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/state-intensifies-vigil-after-hc-directions/article31193904.ece

120,2020/03/28,Wildlife is on a roll in Tirupati,"Animals reclaim lost ground as roads go empty in the wake of the lockdown

With human activity coming to a halt, wild animals are making forays into areas that were off-limits to them earlier in the temple town.

While a similar trend is being witnessed in many parts of the world, Tirupati deserves a special mention as it is nestled amidst the Tirumala hills, which form part of the Seshachalam biosphere reserve.

In the last few days, residents of Alipiri have frequently sighted spotted deer, sambhar and wild boars in large numbers. Institutions dotting the Saluva Narasimharaya Road (Alipiri-Cherlopalli bypass road) such as Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Sri Venkateswara Vedic University and Regional Science Centre have reported forays by such wild animals on to their campuses.

Similarly, spotted deer and sambhar were sighted at dawn or after dusk near the SVIMS doctors’ quarters and Sri Padmavati Medical College for Women (SPMCW).

""Our students have sighted wild boars and deer moving in herds of a dozen and more,"" said SV Vedic University Vice-Chancellor S. Sudarsana Sharma. He said that the animals were venturing into and out of the campus, as the traffic-prone road that separates the campus from the forest remains deserted.

""When our university buildings were built during 2008-11, a lot of snakes and scorpions came out of hiding. We told workers not to harm the reptiles. Even today, our Vedic students find snakes on the campus, but they have been told not to harm them as they are fellow living beings. The Vedas state that every creature has an equal right to live on this earth,"" Prof. Sharma said.

After the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) decided to stop darshan of Lord Venkateswara, the ghat roads, which became empty barring the occasional movement of government vehicles, see several herds of spotted deer in large numbers. Videos of herds of deer on the Tirumala ghat roads have gone viral on social media.

While the rise in animal activity is a welcome sign, officials worry that once human activity resumes, there might be casualties on the roads. ""As of now, the movement of deer on campuses will have no impact. But when vehicles begin plying again, the animals might run helter-skelter causing casualties,"" said S. Saravanan, Chief Conservator of Forest (Tirupati Wildlife Management Circle).",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/inqsq6/article31193520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/223792524col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wildlife-is-on-a-roll-in-tirupati/article31193521.ece
121,2020/03/28,COVID-19 | Living under a lockdown in Andhra Pradesh,"Many are throwing caution to the wind by venturing out of their homes

On March 22, the entire country stayed indoors in solidarity with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appeal to people to voluntarily stay indoors from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

By the end of the day, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy announced a lockdown of the entire State up to March 31 after reviewing the situation in other States. Two days later, as people were still coming to terms with the lockdown, Mr. Modi appeared on television at 8 p.m. on Tuesday to annouce that in four hours, the entire country would go into a total lockdown beginning Tuesday midnight.

Though people were largely determined to abide by the Prime Minister’s call, the self-isolation and social distancing measures seem to have gone for a toss in the days to come, thanks to a lack of well thought-out measures by the administration and a sense of panic among people.

People rushed to rythu bazaars and supermarkets, jostling for groceries — thus doing exactly what the Central and the state governments were urging them not to Panic buying ensued as customers began hoarding essentials for months, fearing that the lockdown might be extended well beyond 21 days.

Officials then attempted to decongest markets by opening them in multiple open areas across cities and towns, and relaxed the timings to minimise travel distance for locals and ensure less crowding. In addition, across the State, traders and

supermarkets were roped in to deliver groceries at the doorstep of their customers.

Efforts in vain?

However, all these efforts are at the risk of going in vain as people are now defying government orders and venturing out of their homes even when it is not needed. A recent instance is that of several residents of the State who wanted to reach their native villages from Telangana, days after the lockdown was announced.

Meanwhile, officials including the police, NGOs and political parties, are taking care of the homeless. Sanitation workers are being provided food and transport facilities, which were not offered initially. The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation has opened up two schools for the homeless where food and care would be provided.

Police excess

Disturbing visuals have emerged of police officials using excessive force against those coming out of their homes. Several people who had come out to buy essentials, or even those who provide essential services, have been targeted by the police. This has led to fear among the public who are now scared of stepping out to buy groceries.

Police high-handedness has allegedly prevented online grocery and food delivery services from operating initially as workers refused to show up fearing police action.

However, the police, too, are on the frontlines in maintaining law and order besides guarding high-risk containment zones round the clock.

Stress on more testing

Following a series of surprise announcements of lockdowns, members of the public are worried that the period could extend indefinitely beyond April 14 if the cases continue to rise in the country and in the State.

Experts are of the opinion that an increased number of sample testings would show the real extent of spread of the virus in the State.

However, the Health Department has only collected 384 samples for tests so far while there are 27,929 foreign returnees identified across the State.

Out of a total of 12 positive cases reported as of Friday morning, two are due to direct transmission from patients who have returned from abroad.

In the rest of the cases, close contacts have tested negative, indicating that the infected persons have followed home quarantine guidelines.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/5omplc/article31193482.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/223812013col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/living-under-a-lockdown/article31193483.ece
122,2020/03/28,COVID-19 | Simple precautions will do the trick,"Avoiding touching one’s face and washing hands regularly will help people stay safe, say doctors

Keeping COVID-19 at bay is relatively easy, as all one needs to do is practise self-isolation, maintain social distancing while venturing outside, and stay hygienic.

P.V. Sudhakar, principal of Andhra Medical College, said regular cleaning of hands with an alcohol-based hand rub, sanitiser or just soap and water, should become a regime. ""If it is with sanitiser, the rinsing should be for 20 seconds at least. If it is soap and water, you should wash for 40 seconds,"" Dr. Sudhakar told The Hindu.

""We touch many surfaces with our hands, and as the virus survives for several hours on different surfaces, there is a possibility of picking up the virus. Once contaminated, your hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can infect you,"" he said.

""One should cover his or her mouth and nose with a tissue or bent elbow while coughing or sneezing. Disposing of the used tissue immediately is essential. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty in breathing, seek immediate medical care,"" said Dr. S. Lakshmi Sowjanya, member of the District Rapid Response Team and Trainer of Trainers. Moreover, droplets from cough or sneeze of an infected person can contain the virus and can spread. By following good respiratory hygiene, you not only protect yourself but also the people around you, she said.

Dr. Sowjanya said that masks need to be worn only by those who are suspected carriers, or those who have tested positive, or those who are taking care of COVID-19 patients and suspected cases.

""Masks should be worn only after the hands are washed with sanitiser or soap and water. Avoid touching the surface of the masks and hold only the strings to fasten and remove from the face. Cover your mouth and nose with the mask and make sure there is no gap between your face and the mask. If it is a single-use mask, do not reuse it and dispose it of and wash your hands again after removing it,"" she said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/m44mei/article31193468.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/223763136col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/simple-precautions-will-do-the-trick/article31193469.ece
123,2020/03/28,COVID-19 | Combating coronavirus is no cakewalk: doctors,"Anantapur district has only around 9,000 beds in all hospitals

Combating the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) will prove to be a long, time-consuming battle, feel medical professionals.

While doctors and scientists in the country have managed to fight and prevail over many dreadful diseases over the years, this virus is unlike anything they have ever seen before, say experts.

In Anantapur district, which has a population of over 40 lakh, the government healthcare infrastructure is limited to only around 3,000 beds in all hospitals — from the tertiary to superspecialty level — and around 6,000 beds in the private sector, including the world-class Sri Sathya Sai Baba Super Specialty Hospital in Puttaparthi.

The government needs to plug key infrastructural shortfalls — chiefly the lack of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) for staff in isolation wards, and ventilators for the critically ill. The Government General Hospital in Anantapur is getting 100 cloth PPE suits for paramedics and doctors in case the disposable ones are exhausted and the demand rises.

The district has 500 N-95 masks, 1,100 ordinary masks, 60 personal protection kits and 1,500 pairs of gloves, which are essential in isolation wards.

Currently, 1,015 persons hailing from Anantapur have been identified with a recent foreign travel history, but only 838 of them could be traced and are being monitored in home isolation. Of them, nine with symptoms have been admitted to the isolation ward of the Government General Hospital here, District Medical and Health Officer K.V.N.S. Anil Kumar told The Hindu.

In all, 655 persons have not yet completed 14 days of isolation and observation; COVID-19 symptoms manifest anytime between three and 21 days, say doctors.

A.P. Vaidya Vidhana Parishad has 1,010 beds at its 19 hospitals in the district, and has only 120 doctors against a requirement of 189, APVVP District Coordinator of Health Services N. Ramesh Nath said.

An under-construction superspecialty hospital near JNTU in Anantapur will be converted into a 200-bed COVID-19 hospital in the days to come, with 56 beds ready as of now. If the need arises, all 500 beds at GGH Anantapur would be converted into COVID-19 isolation wards as no other patient would be admitted. We have also stopped elective procedures, GGH Superintendent M. Ramaswamy Naik said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/l3el1t/article31193459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/223793687col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/combating-covid-19-is-no-cakewalk-doctors/article31193460.ece

All persons with a recent foregin travel history and being monitored in home isolation by a team of paramedical staff will undergo COVID-19 swab test (whether symptomatic or asymptomatic) at the Government Medical College VDRL Microbiology Laboratory at Anantapur from Monday.

District Medical and Health officials are in the process of preparing a time schedule for collection of samples with the help of medical personnel so that all 461 persons in the urban and semi-urban areas are covered from among the 829 such suspects being monitored. State government has assured the laboratory here of sending adequate testing kits by Sunday/Monday so that all of the 461 in the ‘below 14 days isolation period’ category could be tested when the viral load in the body is maximum.

Only in two cases, those who had travelled to Anantapur district or living here and went to Karnataka, they tested positive and of them a woman, who had returned from Haj, died on March 24 night at Gauribidanur in Karnataka and another 64-year-old male is recovering in designated hospital in Bengaluru Rural District.

In a bid to contain COVID-19, the authorities have arranged isolation facilities with 1,600 beds in the district. At the Kurnool Government General Hospital (GGH), a 200-bed isolation facility has been established.

The government has also notified three hospitals for taking in COVID-19 positive cases. The Santiram Medical College and General Hospital in Nandyal with 36 ventilators, Visawabharati General Hospital in Kodumur mandal with two ventilators and the Kurnool GGH with two ventilators together have a total of 2,500 beds and 40 ventilators.

Suspended

Meanwhile, District Collector G. Veerapandian suspended the Adoni deputy district medical and health officer Dr. Ranga Naik on Friday for negligence. The officer allegedly was lax, due to which the setting up of an isolation ward in Yemmiganur has been delayed.

Apart from stopping all inter-State travel, the authorities have also made sure that no inter-district travel takes place. The officials have established seven inter-State and inter-district check-posts to stop non-essential travel.

Even as officials have been asserting that COVID-19 community transmission has not yet begun, contradictory statements by Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol and Health Minister B. Sriramulu on the disease reaching third stage in the State has added to the confusion.

Mr. Karjol told presspersons in Bagalkot that the disease had reached third stage and it was important that people strictly followed precautions. Meanwhile, Mr. Sriramulu, speaking in Mandya, said people should “pray that the disease does not escalate to third stage”.

In fact, over the last few days, Mr. Sriramulu and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar [also in charge of COVID-19 vigil] have been making contradictory statements on issues pertaining to positive cases.

Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education), reiterated that there was no community transmission. “The random sampling study taken up by the Indian Council of Medical Research three days ago has also found that India has not reached Stage 3. This is the latest information I have,” he said.

17 new cases

Meanwhile, 17 new cases, including five each from Gauribidnur and Mysuru and four from Uttara Kannada, tested positive on Saturday. These are the first instances of cluster formations in infections in Karnataka. The number of positive cases in the State has touched 81.

While five primary contacts of another positive patient from Gauribidnur have been infected, the wife and two daughters of a patient from Uttara Kannada and another contact from the same area have also tested positive. All the five cases in Mysuru district were primary contacts of a pharma company employee. The Mysuru cases were reported by Deputy Commissioner Abhiram Sankar late on Saturday night.

Overall, 1,090 primary contacts of the 76 positive cases in the State are being monitored. “They have been divided into high-risk and low-risk patients. Those who are aged and with co-morbidities are being monitored in government-supervised quarantine centres and the rest will be isolated in homes, hotel rooms or guest houses identified by the government,” he said.

131,2020/03/28,"With five more cases, Gauribidanur shuts down","Five more COVID-19 positive cases being reported from Gauribidanur in Chickballapur district has set alarm bells ringing.

The State government has locked down the entire town and appointed KAS officer Varaprasad Reddy, also from the taluk, as special officer. He took charge on Saturday.

“With five more positive cases being reported, the total number has shot up to eight, of which one has died. The cases seem to have formed a cluster around the three who returned from Haj. All the positive cases have been reported from among their primary contacts. Only complete lockdown and social distancing can break this chain and we will ensure it is done. No deviation from government-mandated guidelines will be tolerated,” said Mr. Reddy.

While seven have been put under quarantine at an isolation ward, over 30 other contacts of the new positive patients have been put under home quarantine. Contact tracing is still on and more people will be put under quarantine, the officials said. Police have been deployed at houses where contacts have been home quarantined to ensure there is no breach.

Complete lockdown

Meanwhile, the town has been completely shut down. Clinics and medical stores are also given a small window to open. Grocers are shut down. Volunteers and traders are taking groceries to the residential localities in autos and pushcarts to ensure people do not come out.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/with-five-more-cases-gauribidanur-shuts-down/article31194862.ece
132,2020/03/28,Active surveillance in areas with positive cases,"Worried over the spread of COVID-19 in clusters, the Health Department has been identifying areas that fall within three-km radius of the residence of every positive case as “Red Zone” and within five km as “Buffer Zone”.

B.G. Prakash, State Joint Director (Communicable Diseases), told The Hindu that active surveillance is being taken up in every area declared as Red Zone.

Containment zone

“This is actually the containment zone. Health workers go to every house in this zone to identify if any individual has symptoms. Those with symptoms will be subjected to tests. Health workers will collect their travel history, disinfect the area and take up information, education and communication (IEC) activities on precautions,” he said.

In the ‘Buffer Zone’, passive surveillance such as collecting information from clinics and hospitals in the area about any people reporting with symptoms will be done. We will also make announcements asking people to report to the nearest health facility if they develop any symptoms,” he said.

This is being done in all places from where positive cases have been reported and not just in areas where COVID-19 deaths have occurred, he said.

Stating that there was no meaning in declaring a ‘medical emergency’ in places where deaths have been reported, Dr. Prakash said the World Health Organisation has already declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/active-surveillance-in-areas-with-positive-cases/article31194855.ece
133,2020/03/28,Economic census thrown out of gear,"In several districts, including Bengaluru urban and rural, the survey is yet to start

The economic census, which is already behind schedule in Karnataka, will be delayed further with the COVID-19 outbreak. Incidentally, the pandemic has also put a break on the start of the first phase of Census 2020.

The economic census, which was expected to be completed by the end of March, is now staring at an indefinite extension.

An important indicator for the country’s growth, the economic survey throws up figures on employment, industries, industrial clusters, and the consumption rate of people in the country. The seventh economic survey — initiated by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation — was under progress when the national lockdown was put in place. The last economic survey was conducted in 2013.

“Karnataka was already lagging behind schedule. The census has been halted now due to the outbreak. Now we estimate it may take over a year to complete and that too as and when we can re-start the work,” said a senior official in Directorate of Economics and Statistics.

In fact, in several districts across the State, including the crucial districts of Bengaluru urban and Bengaluru rural, the survey has not begun. In other districts, the progress has been poor at 15% in Mysuru and 21% in Tumakuru, while it hovers around the highest of 30% in coastal districts of Dakshina Kannada, Uttara Kannada, and Udupi. “In several other districts, the situation is no better but work has started at least,” he said.

The senior official said: “However, even before the outbreak was reported, the census had been facing problems in several minority dominated areas where residents refused to share data with the enumerators.”

According to him the outpour over CAA/NPR/NRC since December had affected the enumeration in several districts, and a large number from minority communities have refused to share data. “This refusal, along with delay in collecting the data could lead to huge problems. We believe that the economy and economic activities will throw up a different picture once the COVID-19 scare declines and lives become normal,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2bfq07/article31194153.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGSURVEY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/economic-census-thrown-out-of-gear/article31194155.ece

135,2020/03/28,Lockdown effect: Young farmer dumps tonnes of tomato in lake,"In video message to elected representatives, he explains plight of farmers

A young farmer from Ingalakuppe of Pandavapura in Mandya district dumped several crates of tomato into a lake on Saturday as he could not sell his produce following the lockdown imposed owing to the outbreak of COVID-19.

He left a video message to the elected representatives, including Mandya MP Sumalatha and MLAs, before dumping the tomato produce explaining the plight of farmers like him.

He expressed his displeasure over the elected representatives not appearing in the constituency during the ongoing crisis situation. “The U.K. Prime Minister is also infected with COVID-19 but he is discharging his duties. Where are you MP and MLAs from the district,” he questioned.

According to the villagers, he loaded at least three tonnes of the produce in a mini-van and tried to take it to Mysuru searching for prospective buyers. But, he dropped his plans as the police were “inhumanly behaving” with the farmers.

While the villagers refused to give the name and other details of the farmer, the officials said they were unaware of the incident.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fqbvcp/article31194060.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28MANDYAFARMER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/lockdown-effect-young-farmer-dumps-tonnes-of-tomato-in-lake/article31193990.ece
136,2020/03/28,"Lockdown leads to blood shortage, people urged to donate blood","With the suspension of blood donation camps, in view of the lockdown, the health authorities are reportedly facing a shortage of blood, especially in Kodagu district. The Kodagu Institute of Medical Sciences, Madikeri, which has set up a 100-bed COVID-19 isolation ward, has been making appeals to people to donate blood so that the stock can be replenished.

Ravi Karumbaiah of the District Blood Bank, KIMS, Madikeri, told The Hindu that some donors and members of a few NGOs had come forward to donate. “The donors are escorted to the blood bank on reaching the hospital and blood is drawn after completing the mandatory formalities. Their general health conditions are examined before blood is drawn. We recommend that only healthy persons donate blood,” he said.

Dr. Karumbaiah said the hospital was in touch with NGOs and had hopes of replenishing the stock in three days. “For the time being, there is no need to worry, but we want to keep blood in stock, given the lockdown. We shall draw blood lasting for only one month, as we store blood for 35 days from the date of collection. Today, 15 persons donated blood,” he said. “We need 150 to 200 units of blood a month.”

Though the district hospital’s blood bank maintains that the available stock could last a few days, it aims to stock up for at least one month.

137,2020/03/28,COVID-19: PU paper evaluation will be conducted after April 14,"The second year of pre-university is an important year. It is the time when students plan their careers and focus on the board examination, which will determine the college they get into. But this year, students are at a loss in the backdrop of the novel coronavirus outbreak, which has altered the way the nation is functioning.

Evaluation of the II PU answer scripts has been put off because of the lockdown. As a result, the announcement of results is also expected to be delayed. Sources at Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) stated that this could have a cascading effect on the admissions process for professional courses and also delay the commencement of the next academic year.

M. Kanagavalli, Director of the Department of Pre-University Education, said the evaluation was supposed to start on April 2 and the results were expected to be announced in the last week of the month. “But now, the evaluation will be conducted after April 14, and the English examination will have to be conducted after the lockdown,” she said.

She said the situation was similar for boards across the country and the modalities for admissions into professional courses would be worked out later.

Competitive exams

People preparing for competitive examinations are also worried, as officials are uncertain of their schedule. The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test, which was scheduled for May 3, has been postponed. According to the original schedule, the admit cards were to be made available on Friday, but they have not been released.

The KEA has scheduled the Common Entrance Test on April 22 and 23. “But there is no clarity on whether the test will be conducted on these dates. A decision will be taken at the State government level,” a senior KEA official said.

All this has left students in a difficult position. One, who hopes to get a seat in a medical college, said, “If I am not panicking about getting COVID-19, then I’m obsessing over whether NEET will be conducted and what happens next.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pu-paper-evaluation-will-be-conducted-after-april-14/article31193498.ece

The government has announced that it will procure 1,000 ventilators, 10 lakh N95 masks, 5 lakh kits, and 15 lakh three-layer masks in a week. But many doctors, paramedical staff, and the police have not been given protective masks and other necessary facilities to contain the disease, he claimed.

He said there were differences between two Cabinet Ministers — Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar, who has been assigned the task of handling COVID-19, and Health Minister B. Sriramulu.

142,2020/03/28,"MSMEs seek interest waiver, stipend for workers","They have also sought deferment of payment of minimum wages for one year

With the nationwide lockdown severely hitting micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), where work from home is applicable to less than 8% of the core operations, industry bodies have been demanding a variety of incentives to revive more than six lakh small and medium enterprises in Karnataka.

Karnataka Small Scale Industries Association (KASSIA) has urged the State government to provide relief for payment of fixed charges, electricity and water bills by MSMEs for the next three months as it would be critical for them to start industries again.

Speaking to The Hindu, C.R. Janardhana, president of FKCCI, demanded deferment of payment of minimum wages for one year. KASSIA also urged the State government to permit industries to extend working hours of employees by two hours temporarily to recoup the lost man-days.

The industry body has demanded that banks charge rate of interest on loans granted to MSMEs on par with the interest rate on housing and vehicle loans. R. Raju, president of KASSIA, said small-scale industries have urged the RBI to waive three months’ interest on all loans. “These measures will be essential in order to meet the impending challenges,” Mr. Raju said.

Noting difficulties faced by entrepreneurs, Sampath Raman, chairman, State unit of All India Manufacturers Organisation (AIMO), said the Centre should instruct banks to not make entrepreneurs’ as non-performance asset (NPA) for non-payment of interest till December 31, 2020.

‘Why not bail us out?’

AIMO maintained that “if certain banks, airlines and corporates can be bailed out”, what can prevent the Centre from bailing out MSMEs, considering the sector directly employs over 121 million people in the country. “Work from home has seen a drop in over 63% productivity in the service industry. The industry and services sectors have seen mass migration of labour to their villages,” Mr. Raman argued.

Noting the crisis of MSME/start-up can be called “national calamity”, AIMO demanded that Union and State governments waive bank interest like it was done for farmers, freezing litigations for six months to enable entrepreneurs to find their feet and focus on business. Their other demands include provide a stipend of ₹6,000 per month per worker employed by MSMEs/start-ups directly to the employees for a period of six months; and provide a scheme for relaxation of statutory payments from MSMEs for a period of six months to ESI and PF.

The Centre should come out with an economic package to deal with the current crisis, especially for the MSME sector that contributes 29% of India’s GDP, said the Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce.

Representatives of MSME and trade bodies said sectors such as automobile, hospitality, apparel, consumer durables, electronics, hotels, tourism, restaurants, entertainment industry, seafood and livestock, construction, and transportation are among the worst hit by COVID-19.

AITUC demands compensation

143,2020/03/28,Teachers for COVID-19 teams: Horatti takes exception,"Writes to Chief Secretary, seeks review of circular

Former Chairman of Legislative Council and former Minister Basavaraj Horatti has taken exception to only teachers being included in teams formed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a letter written to the Chief Secretary of Karnataka T.M Vijayabhaskar, which was released to the media here, Mr. Horatti had drawn the attention of the Chief Secretary towards his (CS) circular dated March 26, 2020 pertaining to constituting 100 primary teams to combat the spread of the pandemic.

While welcoming the move to constitute the teams, which he has said is relevant, Mr. Horatti has pointed out that as per the circular there would be one teacher in the primary team and two teachers in the secondary team.

“When I was the Minister for Primary and Secondary Education and you (CS ) were the Principal Secretary of the Department, the question of why only teachers were being deployed for various government works including census and election duty was raised. Subsequently we had taken a decision that apart from the teachers, employees of various government departments should be deployed. A letter was written to the Election Commission against deploying only teachers for election work. Later, an order was issued to utilise the services of employees of all departments for various government works”, Mr. Horatti has recalled in the letter.

He has pointed out that according to the latest circular on COVID-19 teams, apart from paramedical staff, only teachers had been included in the teams and other departments had been left out. “Already various government departments have declared holiday and several have been asked to work from home, in a situation where everyone can’t work from home and there was no necessity for all to work from home. In such a situation these employees could be deployed for the COVID-19 related work” he has said.

Clarifying that he is not against deploying teachers for the work, Mr. Horatti has sought to know why only teachers were singled out. “In various departments there are instances of employees not being available during office hours even when there is lot of work to do”, he has said.

Mr. Horatti has said that teachers should not feel that they were being targeted. “I only want responsibility to be shared by the employees of all departments and these teams should have employees from all the departments depending on their numbers. I have also brought this issue to the notice of the Minister concerned and I request you to review your decision to deploy only teachers”, he has said in the letter.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/teachers-for-covid-19-teams-horatti-takes-exception/article31193016.ece

146,2020/03/28,Govt. paves way for transportation of feed after poultry industry complains birds starving to death,"Supply had been blocked at many places by villagers, police, officials in the wake of COVID scare

The State government has stepped in to permit the transportation of not only poultry products, meat and fish, but also the movement of vehicles carrying bird feed, whose hindrance had led to chicken facing the prospect of starving to death in poultry farms across the State.

Ever since the lockdown was declared earlier this week, the supply of critical ingredients of chicken feed such as soya and maize had been stopped. In poultry farms, where the existing stock was exhausted, birds had begun to die. Knocking on the doors of the government, the Karnataka Poultry Farmers’ and Breeders’ Association (KPFBA) said several crores of birds in the State will perish if steps are not taken immediately to restore supply of chicken feed.

Even though animal husbandry is exempted from the restrictions imposed in the light of COVID-19 spread and animal husbandry had been classified as an essential service, the local police was creating roadblocks in movement of vehicles carrying either chicken and eggs or chicken feed, crucial for rearing both broilers and layer chicken, the Association said.

Poultry farms in Karnataka source soya from Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh while maize grown in different parts of the State is transported to the poultry farms. “Even if they cross the State’s borders, the vehicles are stopped at toll gates by the local police. In a few places, village panchayat representatives are not allowing the vehicles to enter the villages”, said a representative of KPFBA.

District and taluk administration officials too were coming the way of transporting the huge stockpile of chicken and eggs from the poultry farms to the retail stores in different parts of the State.

Circular issued

After a meeting with State government’s Development Commissioner Vandita Sharma, Food Commissioner Ashok Kumar and senior officials of Animal Husbandry Department in Bengaluru on Thursday, where the representatives of KPFBA accused the police and local administration of forcing the closure of shops selling chicken and eggs, the Secretary to the Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Department issued a circular on Friday asking the authorities to permit the transportation of chicken, sheep, goat, pig, fish etc.

The circular addressed to all City Police Commissioners, BBMP Commissioner, all Deputy Commissioners, Chief Executive Officers of Zilla Panchayats, Superintendents of Police and other officials concerned has sought to make it clear that the authorities should not only permit the rearing of chicken, sheep, goat, pig and fish in the farms, but also their transportation, besides allowing the transportation of chicken feed to save the crores of chicken in the poultry farms across the State.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/govt-paves-way-for-transportation-of-feed-after-poultry-industry-complains-birds-starving-to-death/article31191544.ece

After the closure of cocoon markets across the State earlier this week as part of the precautionary measures against spread of COVID-19, farmers have begun selling cocoons directly to reelers.

A large number of sericulture farmers across the State were worried over the fate of their cocoons after the markets were ordered to be closed. A perishable commodity, cocoons have to be sold in time for reeling process to begin before moths emerge from them.

Sericulture Department officials too came to the aid of the desperate farmers by connecting them to reelers. “We are busy sharing information of reelers with farmers so that they can sell the cocoons to them locally,” said Somanna, a department official who is in charge of the cocoon market in Mysuru.

Sahadeve Gowda from Seerehenhalli in Hunsur taluk, near here, was worried about losing his entire crop of 120 kg of cocoons after the government closed the markets on Tuesday. He somehow managed to sell the cocoons to a reeler, travelling all the way to Channapatna. Also, he had to settle for a measly ₹200 a kg, though he was expecting much more had he sold the cocoons in the market.

In the sericulture-intensive district of Ramanagaram, the Deputy Commissioner had directed department officials to identify reelers locally so that the cocoons reared by farmers can be sold after due inspection for quality and price.

Mr. Somanna said farmers were provided details of reelers so that they could get in touch with them directly.

Though the State government on Thursday issued orders to reopen the cocoon markets, they remained closed on Friday. “We don’t want the farmers to be exposed to COVID-19 risk in the markets,” said Gautham Gowda, leader of Ramanagaram Sericulture Farmers’ Welfare Association. Transactions between individual farmers and reelers are taking place away from the cocoon market at a pre-agreed place, he said.

Though reelers are purchasing the cocoons, farmers said the price had come down substantially.

Reelers in lockdown

While officials said the lockdown rules applied even to reelers, who will not be able to carry out regular reeling activity in their units, retired Deputy Director of Sericulture N.Y. Chigari told The Hindu that the reelers have to stifle the cocoons, a treatment taken up to prevent the emergence of moths and preserve the cocoons for a longer period. But, the reeler runs the risk of damage to the cocoons from attacks by termites and ants after one or two months, which will reduce the quality of cocoons.

But, the cocoons lose their economic value if moths emerge from them. “Under such circumstances, it is best for the government to have a cocoon bank with facilities for stifling,” he said.

Other activities also hit

The reports suggested that some private medical practitioners in the city are not providing medical services citing lockdown announced by the government to check the spread of coronavirus.

Ms. Deepa has said that medical services have been categorised under the list of essential services. Therefore, private medical centres should not deny OPD services. Doctors, nurses and paramedical staff should provide medical services taking due precautionary measures and using self-defence equipment.

The common people should not run from pillar to post for availing themselves of medical care, she added.

153,2020/03/28,Temporary decentralised vegetable markets to be set up in Hubballi,"Steps being taken to have groceries delivered at people’s doorstep

Minister for Large and Medium Industries and district in-charge Jagadish Shettar has said that steps were being taken to set up temporary decentralised vegetable markets and steps were also being taken to deliver grocery items at people’s doorstep.

Speaking to presspersons here after inspecting the arrangements made for temporary markets at the Nehru Stadium and the APMC Yard at Amargol near Hubballi, Mr. Shettar clarified that there were no restrictions on transport of grocery items and vegetables.

He said that centralised markets would lead to large number of people congregating at one place defeating the very purpose of lockdown.

“To overcome the problem, open spaces and playgorounds have been identified in the 82 wards of the Hubballi Dharwad Municipal Corporation. As many as 182 retail vegetable vendors will be asked to take push carts and vehicles to the streets in each wards. This will help prevent people from going to the markets. Similarly, retail grocery merchants have been asked to deliver grocery items to the doorsteps of residents,” he said.

The Minister said that he would appeal to the people to maintain safe distance from others in the interest of their own health. They should understand the significance of the 21-day lockdown ordered by the Prime Minister and also impose upon themselves self-restrictions.

He said that from Saturday there would be more restrictions on the movement of people and only one person from a family should come out to purchase essential commodities. He appealed to the public to cooperate with the administration in implementing the 21-day lockdown effectively.

Earlier, while inspecting the arrangements at the APMC Yard, Mr. Shettar instructed the officials to make different entry and exit points for arrival and departure of farmers and retail and wholesale merchants. “While it is important for vendors not to congregate at one point, it is equally important for buyers to practice social distancing,” he said.

No fresh cases

The Minister clarified that there were no fresh cases of COVID-19 infection in the district apart from the lone case reported so far and the patient too was responding well to treatment. He was accompanied by MLA Arvind Bellad, Deputy Commisioner Deepa Cholan, Police Commissioner R. Dileep, Superintendent of Police Vartika Katiyar, Municipal Commissioner Suresh Itnal and other officials.

As the public transport is off the road following the lockdown and enforcement of prohibitory orders under section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, five persons who were working in Bengaluru had requested Syed Khasim, an ambulance driver, to drop them to their village, Kadekal, near Shivamogga.

The accused, a native of Anwar Colony in Bhadravati, heeded to their request and dropped them to their village in the ambulance on March 25.

Following this, a case under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269(negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of Indian Penal Code has been booked against Khasim on the charge of misusing the ambulance to hoodwink the authorities who were preventing the movement of people to avoid spread of the disease.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/man-held-for-ferrying-people-in-ambulance/article31188081.ece
156,2020/03/28,COVID-19 restrictions hit other patients hard,"Many of them are finding it difficult to get medical help even during emergencies

The COVID-19 restrictions in hospitals have hit patients with other ailments hard. Despite the government making it clear that hospitals are not to turn away emergency cases, some are not attending to even those in advanced labour.

Cases have been reported of patients from across the State running from pillar to post to get medical aid during emergencies. With COVID-19 being the main concern now, even an outbreak of cholera in Bengaluru did not get much attention.

Shutters down

While smaller private hospitals and clinics in some areas have downed shutters on their own, bigger hospitals have put up boards asking patients to visit only in cases of emergency. Some have even started video and telephonic consultations. On Thursday, the government permitted registered medical practitioners to provide tele-consultation to patients with minor ailments and those whose medical history is known to them.

However, patients who need to see a doctor immediately for emergencies not related to COVID-19 are facing difficulties.

Two days ago, a 20-year-old domestic help at Rajanakunte, who was in an advanced stage of pregnancy, had to run from one hospital to another in Yelahanka and surrounding areas seeking help.

Chaya Bhatia, a resident of a gated community at Rajanakunte, who found the woman in total distress in front of a medical shop, said she had no baby movement and was in severe pain. The woman, who first went to a government hospital in Yelahanka, was asked to get an ultrasound scan done from outside. Nishant Bhatia, son of Ms. Bhatia, said, “After the scan, she was told that her baby was no more and that she had to undergo a procedure. However, as there was no doctor available on the day, she was asked to come at a later date, which is shocking.”

Mr. Bhatia, with the help of some other residents of the gated community, got the woman admitted at a private polyclinic, where she underwent the procedure. “The lockdown is causing a lot of inconvenience to poor patients,” he said.

Case in Dandeli

On Monday, at Dandeli in Uttara Kannada district, the family of a 33-year-old woman, who was also in an advanced stage of labour, desperately tried to get her medical attention. “All private hospitals in Dandeli are closed and the staff at the general hospital refused to take responsibility. The family was asked to take her to Hubballi, which is 75 km away. They somehow managed to get her there,” said Mohammad Iqbal Shaikh, secretary of Anjuuman-e-Ahle Sunnat, an organisation in Dandeli.

At Victoria Hospital, where the government has proposed to set up a dedicated COVID-19 facility, not just outpatients, even inpatients are finding it hard as they are being asked to get discharged as soon as they are stabilised.

“If government hospitals refuse to attend to us on the ground that all doctors are busy with COVID-19 cases, where can we go?” asked Manjamma, who had brought her ailing daughter to Victoria Hospital earlier this week.

S. Srinivas, State secretary of Indian Medical Association, said although hospitals have been asked not to turn away emergency cases, there may be some exceptions at some hospitals where the staff may not be able to get to work because of the lockdown, especially in rural and peripheral areas. “But emergencies such as pregnancies cannot be delayed. We will issue an advisory in this regard,” he said.

‘Rectifying issues’

Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education), said, “We are in the process of rectifying these issues. We have only said electives and non-essential cases can be deferred. If any specific cases of emergency refused are brought to our notice, we will initiate action against the hospital,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/satjsg/article31188041.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGVICTORIAHOSPITALPREMISES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-restrictions-hit-other-patients-hard/article31188042.ece
157,2020/03/28,Looking beyond their own needs in the time of lockdown,"NGOs and even individuals are reaching out to the needy

With the entire State in lockdown, thousands of daily wage workers trapped in the city and the homeless are struggling to survive and get two square meals a day. Most of them are relying on non-governmental organisations and unions that have stepped up to support them and provide temporary assistance to labourers and their families. There have also been spontaneous offers of help from citizens.

Nalini Shekar, co-founder of Hasiru Dala, an NGO that works with waste-pickers, said they are trying to provide aid to 1,000 families and have sought donations. They plan to give families of waste-pickers five kg of rice/wheat, two kg of lentils, and two bars of soap, costing ₹550. This amount includes transportation to their homes. “We have chosen families who don’t have a ration card as the government is already giving two months’ supply to such families. These supplies will last the families for about 12 days,” said Ms. Shekar. Within a day of circulating the messages on social media, Hasiru Dala received donations that would help around 200 families.

Anand N.R., a freelance driver, said an NGO, CAPS Foundation, got his family groceries worth ₹2,000. “It is a desperate situation as the number of bookings have reduced to a large extent. One of my customers told the NGO about my situation and the help extended was timely,” he said.

In film industry

Meanwhile, with shooting and all other aspects of film production coming to a halt, members of the Kannada film industry too are stepping up to offer support to colleagues, including technicians, drivers, stuntmen, and those part of the production team. Film-maker Pawan Kumar started this initiative last Sunday. “I wanted to tell everyone that at a time when we are all at home, we can do something constructive for people in our fraternity,” he told The Hindu. As of Friday, he has collected ₹5.81 lakh. Actor Chetan Kumar, who is in touch with many of the unions, has also decided to help Mr. Pawan Kumar in identifying people who may be in dire need.

Volunteers needed

Naavu Bharateeyaru, a platform of various civil society groups which came together in November last year to oppose NPR and NRC, is now focussing on fighting the pandemic by ensuring food security and emergency medical relief. “While doing so, we will take utmost care to ensure that our volunteers are safe,” said a note from members of the platform. The platform needs volunteers for several tasks, including rapid assessment of needs and procuring relief material.

In several areas, police personnel on patrol duty are distributing food to the homeless and those from lower economic background as a majority of the hotels and eateries are closed. However, a few hotels in the city are distributing food boxes to migrant workers and labourers.

Several residents are doing their bit to help out, too. Sujaya M., a homemaker who lives at Rajajinagar, for instance, is cooking lunch for five homeless people in her locality. “It is during these testing times that we need to help each other. I may not be able to help a large number of people, but I decided to do the best I could,” she said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/s8eg8t/article31188002.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGFOOD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/looking-beyond-their-own-needs-in-the-time-of-lockdown/article31188003.ece

The harvest of the ‘puncha’ crop (first crop) and procurement are back in full swing in Kuttanad.

Last week, the entire process came to a halt after the State government declared a lockdown and the district administration imposed Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to check the spread of COVID-19. But, the State government later included paddy harvesting, procurement and other related activities on the list of essential services.

Time-bound manner

A high-level meeting attended by Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran, Food and Civil Supplies Minister P. Thilothaman, and Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar here on Thursday also decided to complete the harvest and procurement in a time-bound manner.

A.V. Suresh Kumar, senior paddy marketing officer, Supplyco, says that around 54,000 tonnes of paddy has been procured from Alappuzha district so far this season.

“Harvest has been completed in 40% of the paddy fields in the district. The truckers are charging excessive rates for transporting the procured paddy to mills. Although there are some issues, the procurement is going on,” he said.

Around 200 combine harvesters have been deployed in the district. In the wake of COVID-19, a special health protocol for loading and unloading workers, truck drivers and operators of combine harvesters has been formulated.

Officials say 80% of the paddy would be procured by April and the procurement would be completed by May 15, as decided at the high-level meeting.

According to the Agriculture Department, the farmers have undertaken paddy farming in more than 27,500 hectares in the district, a major portion of which is in Kuttanad. Some 49,000 farmers have registered online with Supplyco for selling their produce this season.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/5ikmg3/article31195152.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29tval2--paddy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/first-crop-harvest-back-in-full-swing/article31195153.ece

161,2020/03/28,When the day’s labour goes down the drain,"Toddy tappers have to pour away the yield as shops are shut due to lockdown

Be it COVID-19, Nipah, or flood, a toddy tapper’s life is one sans rest.

He has to cut the unopened inflorescence everyday, whether it is coconut or a palm tree and collect toddy twice a day.

However, the inflorescence has to be prepared for nearly a month for it to provide the yield. If the toddy is not tapped for a single day, the whole effort is lost and the bunch has to be abandoned.

Sanu K.S., a toddy tapper at Doreland, says though he is not selling toddy to the toddy shop now he has to tap toddy daily.

“I have been advised by the Excise Department to pour away the yield as toddy shops have been closed in the wake of the lockdown enforced to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”

Sanu used to sell nearly seven litres of palm toddy to a shop at Mattukatta at ₹43 a litre. “I am now without any income though I have to do my daily work,” he says.

“The yield may sometimes go up to 15 litres a day during the bumper season and it is generally lean days during the summer. Once a palm or coconut tree is prepared, it provides toddy for nearly seven months,” Sanu says.

He taps four palms a day in the morning and evening. “My work starts at 7.30 a.m. and I sell the toddy at 9.30 a.m. The toddy tapped in the evening is sold the next day and is known as mooppan kallu, as it is more fermented,” he says.

Sanu started tapping toddy at Doreland three months ago after working under a trade union toddy tapper at Vellilamkandam for three years.

“There have been occasions when I had to discard the inflorescence as it did not yield toddy even though I prepared it for 30 days. However, another bunch in the same tree may yield toddy,” he says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/6xhcwa/article31195077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv29idukkipalmjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/when-the-days-labour-goes-down-the-drain/article31195078.ece

Welfare pensions have started reaching people in the district, who were struggling to meet ends in the wake of the lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

With their livelihood lost, many were finding it difficult to purchase essential things, including medicines.

“None of us has stepped out of the house for the last one week. We have ration rice at home. But there is no money for buying my medicines. How we will get money for vegetables and other provisions. The welfare pension is a huge relief for my family,” said Ammini of Kanattukara.

This is not the case of Ammini alone. Her neighbours Thankammal and Kochammini also shared the same view.

163,2020/03/28,State’s first victim buried as per protocol,"The 69-year-old man had earlier undergone a bypass surgery and had co-morbid conditions

A 69-year-old man who was under treatment for COVID-19 at the Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam, died on Saturday morning.

The body was buried following all precautions and as per his religious custom. Five of his kin, five volunteers, and five representatives of the district administration, district health department, and the Kochi Corporation took part in the funeral.

The man had returned from Dubai on March 16 and was under observation at home. However, his swab sample was taken when he showed symptoms and was admitted to the hospital on March 22 with acute pneumonia.

The daily bulletin from the district administration said he had earlier undergone a bypass surgery and was on medication for blood pressure and heart ailments. As his condition worsened, he was put on ventilator support, but his life could not be saved.

As per protocol, his body was covered in a triple-layer bag before being loaded to a 108 ambulance. The district administration and the Health Department oversaw the funeral. Volunteers wore masks and hand gloves and all religious rites were performed without touching the body.

The bulletin said there were 148 passengers on the plane which flew him from Dubai to Kochi. Of these, 34 were from Ernakulam. A total of 83 people from his contact list were under observation in the district. The deceased man’s wife and the online taxi driver who ferried him from the airport had tested positive and were under treatment and remained stable at the MCH, which had been recognised as a COVID-19 care centre.

164,2020/03/28,State entering crucial phase of COVID-19 surveillance,"Challenge is to spot new cases outside the pool of the quarantined as these would be the first indication of a community spread

Kerala is entering the next phase of the surveillance to contain COVID 19. The disease epidemiology now gets more complicated, demanding a dynamic surveillance strategy, one that will account for early detection and containment of a possible community transmission.

Till now, the focus of surveillance has been on people with a travel history to affected countries in the last one month, both Keralites and foreign and domestic tourists.

The State’s containment strategy of quarantining them and keeping the primary, secondary contacts of all those who test positive under surveillance has been working well. So far, only a handful of primary contacts have tested positive and the infection has not gone to the secondary contacts.

Unlike the U.S., U.K. and Italy which hardly had any time before cases exploded in the community, Kerala has the much-needed time to recalibrate its surveillance and containment strategy with the lockdown in place.

Next crop of cases

“The next crop of cases will be coming up from the pool of the one lakh people who are already quarantined. These numbers will surge initially and then plateau off as there is no more importation of infection. But it would be suicidal to relax. The challenge is to find out if there are any new cases outside this pool because that would be the first indication of a community spread,” says a senior epidemiologist.

One can most likely suspect that community transmission has taken place when the first case outside the quarantined pool (which has no travel history or no known contact with any potential source of infection) turns up. Frontline healthcare personnel have the highest chance of contracting infection from an undetected/asymptomatic COVID 19 case.

“Surveillance of clusters of mild respiratory illnesses amongst hospital staff should be initiated as the first step to detect community transmission. Investigating all serious cases of viral pneumonia in hospitals to detect if any is linked to COVID-19 would confirm the same,” he adds.

Viral pneumonia

It is now established that 80% have mild symptoms and 20 serious illness 20% (who require ICU care, ventilatory support).

“When it comes to viral pneumonia surveillance, even the single case that we pick up could be extremely important because it comes from that small pool of 20%. It essentially means that the remaining the 80% are in the community undetected,’’ he says.

Now that the Indian Council of Medical Research has also suggested expanding the surveillance of severe acute respiratory illnesses (SARI), the State should not delay viral pneumonia surveillance. Because once these hidden or undetected cases in the community surfaces as patient clusters in many places, it would be a lost battle,” a public health scientist points out.

Once rain or summer showers start, the next driver of epidemic could be the glut of flu cases with upper respiratory infection, making it difficult for doctors to distinguish it from COVID-19.

In a crowded emergency room, this could result in an amplification of disease transmission, a scenario which is highly likely in Kerala, he warns.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dmw8uz/article31195021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TV29COVIDMMS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-entering-crucial-phase-of-covid-19-surveillance/article31195022.ece

166,2020/03/28,CM says do not disrupt newspaper distribution,"Distribution of newspapers an essential service

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Saturday that distribution of newspapers was an essential service.

He had come across reports of some residents’ associations and owners of apartments forbidding its distribution. He urged the public not to disrupt newspaper distribution.

Waste disposal

The Chief Minister said waste disposal was an essential service and hence exempted from the lockdown. Mr. Vijayan predicted an increase in demand for essential items during the upcoming Easter and Vishu festival season.

The government was in touch with wholesale dealers in other States to ensure the unimpeded supply of essentials. He urged the people to step up local procurement of vegetables and fruits.

Large swathes of pineapple plantations were ripe for harvest. Nearly 57,000 hectares of vegetables were ready for picking, he said.

He urged persons holding public office and party positions to ensure social distancing at press conferences.

167,2020/03/28,Pinarayi vexed with Karnataka’s ‘no’ to removing roadblocks,"Talks with Gowda make little headway, Kerala may seek PM’s intervention

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday gave vent to his frustration that Karnataka had not yet removed the embankments of earth built on their side of the inter-State border to deter traffic to and from Kerala.

He said the Kerala government's negotiations with Karnataka to allow minimal freight and ambulance movement along the arterial border roads had made little headway. He could not get through on the telephone to Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa though he had made several attempts. “Mr Yediyurappa might have been busy,” he said.

Mr .Vijayan had on Friday informed Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the situation. In a letter, he had said Karnataka’s action was tantamount to a brazen violation of the Centre’s directive to keep inter-State borders open for emergency traffic and freight during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. Mr. Modi had deputed Union Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers D. V. Sadananda Gowda to resolve the issue. Mr Vijayan said he had broached the issue with Mr. Gowda.

“Mr. Gowda said he would talk with the Karnataka government and inform me about the progress. I hope there would be some progress. As of yet, earth walls are still in place on the Karnataka side of the border. If the situation continues, Kerala will have to seek the intervention of the Prime Minister,” he said.

Mr Vijayan said hundreds of patients in Kasaragod district depended on medical facilities in Mangaluru. Many were those requiring regular dialysis to survive. Karnataka should at least allow ambulances ferrying such patients to pass.

“There is mounting public anxiety in Kasaragod. Mangaluru is the nearest urban Centre. People of Kasaragod have a traditional association with the city,” he said.

Long detours

Mr Vijayan said the blockade had hit movement of freight from Karnataka to Kerala. The barriers have forced cargo lorries to take long detours.

He expressed the hope that the government would resolve issues regarding connectivity with Tamil Nadu by Sunday. Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty would meet S. P. Velumani, Minister for Municipal Administration, Tamil Nadu, and Deputy Speaker, Tamil Nadu, V. Jayaraman at the Nadapoly check-post bordering Palakkad at 9 a.m.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pinarayi-vexed-with-karnatakas-no-to-removing-roadblocks/article31194986.ece
168,2020/03/28,"Tribes, ignorant of COVID-19, briefed on perils","Collector, MLA carry 15-kg kits to settlement, ask people not to venture out

It took half an hour for Konni MLA K.U. Janeeshkumar and District Collector P.B. Noohu to reach the Avanippara tribal settlement in Aruvappulam grama panchayat on the forest fringes of Konni, wading through the knee-deep waters in the Achencoil river on Saturday.

The duo carried a 15-kg bag comprising rice, provisions, and vegetables on their backs all the way to the tribal settlement that houses 37 families.

The forest dwellers were unaware of COVID-19 and the lockdown to contain the spread of the disease.

Kaithangu project

The MLA and Collector briefed them on the growing threat of COVID-19 infection and the need to remain in their settlement itself, giving top priority to their health. The MLA and Collector visited the tribal hamlet as part of the former’s social service platform Kaithangu, extending a helping hand to the needy people in the Assembly segment.

To 37 families

The team of volunteers who accompanied the duo distributed the kits, carrying 10 kg rice, 1 kg of coconut oil, sugar, urad dal, salt, a packet of tea and coffee powder, soap, and vegetables, to all the 37 families in the colony.

The Collector said the Kaithangu project was of great help in keeping the people restricted to their houses in connection with the drive to contain the pandemic. The project is aimed at bringing medicines, rice, provisions and other articles to the doorsteps of the needy in all the 11 grama panchayats in Konni.

Mr. Noohu said the Tribal Welfare Department had taken steps to distribute food and medicines to the forest dwellers of Avanippara. A medical team led by C.

169,2020/03/28,Stranded Keralites in U.K. seek help to return home,"15 marine engineers went there for study last month

A group of 15 stranded Malayali marine engineers pursuing short-term courses at South Tyneside College in northeast England have appealed for help in getting home as they stare at the worsening COVID-19 situation and shortage of essential items.

“We came here on February 7 to attend a six-week course. The exams were cancelled on March 23 and restrictions were already in place by then. The rate of infections here is growing. We are not getting any sanitisers, masks or gloves. To get food, we are standing in long queues,” said Akhil Dharmaraj, a resident of Kalady here, over a WhatsApp chat.

Vishnu Rajendran of Irinjalakuda said they are working with various shipping companies and had undertaken the courses as part of enhancing their career credentials.

“We are living in various groups with common kitchen, washrooms, etc. There will be no scope for isolation if anyone among us gets infected. As the flight restrictions are being extended, lots of people are worried about the escalating prices and accommodation charges here,” he said.

Rojo Jose Thettayil of Thrissur pointed out that they did not have any insurance cover and were worried about the prolonged lockdown.

“We had contacted the Indian Embassy. They told us to follow the official guidelines. Many among us are the supporting members of our families back in Kerala,” he said. Mr. Akhil said the visa validity of many of the aspirants will expire soon. “But the government has assured us that it will be extended. Like us, there are at least 350 other stranded Indian students in various higher educational institutions in the U.K., with whom we have networked.

170,2020/03/28,Strict curbs on Holy Week observance,"Circulars issued by Churches asks faithful to abide by govt.-imposed restrictions

Holy Week observances are being scaled down drastically and will mostly go without participation of the faithful with various Church denominations issuing circulars to cut down on the ceremonies in the wake of the COVID-19 spread.

Washing of the feet and Way of the Cross, two major events during the Holy Week, have been done away with this year. Only a limited number of palm leaves will be blessed for Palm Sunday, which marks the opening of the Holy Week recalling the New Testament account of Jesus entering Jerusalem riding a donkey.

Joseph Mar Gregorios, metropolitan trustee of the Jacobite group of the Malankara Church, has already issued a circular calling on the faithful to cooperate with the restrictions imposed by the State authorities and to ensure that churches remained closed to the public.

Cardinal Mar George Alencherry, head of the Syro-Malabar Church, said in a circular on Saturday that the Holy Week ceremonies would go without the participation of the faithful according to instructions from Rome. Not more than five persons will attend the ceremonies at cathedrals and parish churches.

Easter Mass

The breaking of the bread on Thursday evening should be restricted to single families. Blessing of water on Easter has been postponed and Easter Sunday Mass will be offered on Sunday morning instead of the normal ceremonies after Saturday midnight, said the Cardinal.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/strict-curbs-on-holy-week-observance/article31194904.ece

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday said those who could not do without liquor daily would soon have the opportunity to avail themselves of a fixed quota of legal alcohol from the Excise Department.

However, they would have to produce a medical testimonial from a qualified doctor. He said the ban on the sale of liquor during the lockdown was creating a host of social problems the State could do without. Suicide tendency was prevalent among those deprived of their daily dose of alcohol.

Mental, physical issues

At least two had committed suicide in the State. Many others developed mental and physical issues. The Excise Department has offered free treatment and board to persons who would willingly seek de-addiction.

172,2020/03/28,Guidelines for alcohol-use disorders,"Most cases of withdrawal symptoms should be managed at primary health centres

Following the closure of Kerala State Beverages Corporation’s outlets in the wake of the lockdown to contain COVID-19, the State has issued guidelines for people turning up with alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

The guidelines for the disorders specify that a simple treatment regime is to be followed strictly in the three-tier system of health-care institutions so that tertiary-care hospitals are not burdened. District medical officers have been asked to ensure at least 10-20 beds for de-addiction.

Most cases of withdrawal symptoms should be managed at primary health centres (PHCs), says Kiran P.S., State nodal officer, Mental Health Programme.

“We are expecting a number of people, though mostly with mild symptoms,” says Dr. Kiran. Awareness of withdrawal symptoms has been provided at the grassroots for health workers and community workers such Anganwadi and Kudumbashree workers. Ward councillors who are part of the ward-level health committee formed for COVID-19 prevention could direct the patient to the PHC.

Symptoms graded

The guidelines have graded symptoms as mild, moderate, and severe. Doctors at the PHC should do a physical examination to rule out injuries and basic health parameters should also be checked, says a doctor at a PHC.

Only a few could develop severe symptoms while most others would develop mild symptoms, says a senior psychiatrist in the State. While it could be said that 1-2% of the male population would be showing withdrawal symptoms, considering the State’s population, an average of 10,000 people could be affected in a district.

Most of the severe symptoms needing medical attention could manifest three to five days after the last alcohol consumption. But a good numbers would be showing mild to moderate symptoms, which with proper management could taper off in a week.

The person would be completely out of alcohol addiction within ten days, says a senior psychiatrist.

Alcoholics showing severe symptoms could be driven to suicide, says another senior psychiatrist. Hallucinocis is often seen in addicts who have either reduced their intake or have not taken any alcohol for about 3-4 days.

It is a state of disorder in which the person hears threatening voices that drive him to suicide.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/xlug2p/article31194887.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29tv-Alcoholcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/guidelines-for-alcohol-use-disorders/article31194886.ece
173,2020/03/28,State registers first COVID-19 death,"Six more new positive cases reported

Kerala reported its first COVID-19 death on Saturday.

A 69-year-old man who had been under treatment at the Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam, died in the morning. He was buried in Ernakulam as per protocol. The man who returned from Dubai on March 16 was admitted to the hospital on March 22 with acute pneumonia.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the State would continue the surveillance and quarantine process and at the same time, seriously investigate if community transmission was happening. The government decided to go ahead with rapid test modality for COVID-19 detection (IgM/IgG antibody-based tests) in the community to understand if the silent transmission of the virus is happening.

Mr. Vijayan paid his respects to the first victim, whose severe and uncontrolled co-morbidities had complicated the treatment.

On Saturday, six positive cases were reported in the State. Two of the cases are from Thiruvananthapuram, while Kollam, Palakkad, Malappuram and Kasaragod reported one case each. The total number of patients under treatment is 165. While 1.34 lakh people are under surveillance, only 620 are in isolation wards in hospitals and the rest are on home quarantine.

Mr. Vijayan said the government was in the process of linking research organisations, industrial units, manufacturing firms of biomedical supplies and creating an industrial enterprises cluster to mass manufacture respirators, ventilators, personal protection equipment, oxygen cylinders and biomedical supplies on a war footing.

He announced the launch of ‘Break Corona’ scheme, wherein the government was inviting innovative ideas from society to combat COVID-19 and to augment the State’s response to the lethal pathogen. A website, breakcorona.in has been set up with the help of the Startup Mission, through which people can submit their ideas.

The government was considering the setting up of an online counselling facility for helping those under quarantine, most of whom are undergoing severe stress.

Mr. Vijayan said the drop in the number of positive cases should in no way reduce the vigil against the virus.

He said with postal and courier services at a standstill, the special permission won by Air Asia to transport drugs and essential supplies was a huge relief. He said the government was in talks with insurance companies as non-renewal could lead to the lapse of health insurance policies.

The State government had raised with Karnataka government the issue of hardships faced by chronic disease and dialysis patients in Kasaragod, who were dependent on Mangalore for medical treatment, after the closure of the inter-State borders. However, a decision was still awaited, Chief Minister said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-registers-first-covid-19-death/article31194501.ece
174,2020/03/28,Lockdown violators forced to do squats,"CM warns of action against Kannur DPC

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has condemned the Kannur district police for having made passers-by perform forced squats as a punishment for gathering publicly during lockdown hours.

The Chief Minister said here on Saturday he had sought a report from State Police Chief (SPC) Loknath Behera and hinted that he might take action against District Police Chief (DPC), Kannur, Yatish Chandra. A widely circulated WhatsApp video showed Mr. Chandra administering corporal punishment to a group of three persons in front of a half-open convenience store at Azheekal.

Mr. Vijayan said the incident went against the grain of Kerala’s culture. The event was a blot on the reputation of the force.

A preliminary inquiry had revealed that an officer had shot the video at the instance of Mr. Chandra and disseminated it later through social media.

Mr. Chandra told reporters in Kannur that he had acted in public interest. The police had found it difficult to restrict gatherings in rural localities. He thought a token punishment aired on social media would act as a social deterrent and keep people indoors.

Probe ordered

Meanwhile, the State Human Rights Commission ordered an inquiry into the incident by the SPC. Its member P. Mohandas said the inquiry report must be submitted within three weeks.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lockdown-violators-forced-to-do-squats/article31193935.ece
175,2020/03/28,Vehicle dealers heave a sigh of relief,"Extension of deadline to sell and register Bharat Stage-IV vehicles

Vehicle dealerships have heaved a sigh of relief as the Supreme Court has extended the March 31 deadline to sell and register Bharat Stage-IV (BS-IV) vehicles which were idling in their inventory, due to customers preferring BS-VI vehicles, slack demand and the standstill that has arisen due to COVID-19 threat.

Approximately seven lakh two-wheelers, 15,000 passenger vehicles (cars and SUVs) and 12,000 commercial vehicles manufactured as per BS-IV specifications have not been sold yet. The apex court permitting sale of 10% of the stock (70,000 two-wheelers, 1,500 passenger vehicles and 1,200 commercial vehicles) would bring some respite to dealers who are struggling to pay even salary of workers in the wake of the nationwide shutdown, said Rajwanth Ben, who co-owns a dealership.

The court ruled on Friday that a BS-IV vehicle sold before March 31 can be registered after the lockdown was withdrawn, extending the deadline to April 30. Dealers, except in Delhi-NCR can sell 10% of their existing stock of unsold vehicles once the lockdown is lifted.

Faced with unsold inventory of BS-IV vehicles, many car dealers were selling vehicles at throwaway prices, offering discount of over 50%, said Azad Harry Pothen, a dealer. “Dealerships in Kerala were already hit by plummeting sales due to the flood of 2018 and 2019. Faced with the COVID-19 crisis and the resultant uncertainty, purchasing a new automobile would be the last priority of most people,” he said.

Most dealers had reduced their inventory of BS-IV vehicles since December 2019, as BS-VI emission norms were to take effect from April 1. They could have sold all these vehicles had it not been for the viral outbreak. Dealers will find the going tough if the volume of sales tumbles, since most get 3% commission on sale of cars. Of this, many forego up to 1.50% by way of discounts and other means. “We are banking on discerning customers who are socially and environmentally conscious to purchase BS-VI vehicles which pollute much less than their BS-IV counterparts. Only that they cost marginally higher. Two-wheeler manufacturers will be more affected than car makers by the new emission norms,” Mr Pothen said.

With the COVID-19 outbreak coinciding with the end of the fiscal, paying salary seems to be a bigger worry for dealers than meeting their monthly target. “The salary of our workforce alone works out to around ₹50 lakh. While we can somehow manage the salary for March, uncertainty looms over salary for April. While we do not have any BS-IV vehicles in our inventory, those who have them would have to sell them as used vehicles or rely on them for spare parts,” Mr. Ben said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vehicle-dealers-heave-a-sigh-of-relief/article31193840.ece

178,2020/03/28,Dog days are here for strays,"Citizenry and People For Animals rally to feed street dogs

S. Babu, 63, a retired artisan, has been feeding homeless dogs in his neighbourhood since 2011. He says these are dog days for strays everywhere.

Street dogs are among the many nameless casualties of the COVID-19 lockdown. They are facing starvation.

No leftovers

The ubiquitous piles of food leftovers from hotels and homes have mostly disappeared off the streets.

Public taps are few and far between. Natural water sources are drying up as the summer approaches its zenith.

Mr. Babu says leftovers from meat stalls are at a premium due to the lockdown. He is at the local market at 5 a.m. to scrounge up some scraps from the butchers.

As the lockdown progresses, Babu says he is finding it difficult to find rice and LPG refills to cook for the dogs.

“It is painful. The dogs keep a keen ear out for the sound of my bike. I cannot disappoint them,” he says.

Feeder passes

Latha Indira, secretary of the People For Animals (PFA), Thiruvananthapuram chapter, says she has moved the government to give “feeder passes” to persons like Babu.

Ms. Latha hopes Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s appeal on Friday to take care of strays would prompt authorities to exempt them from the lockdown. She said at least 50 persons have volunteered to provide for street dogs.

Ms. Indira says a 2013 Municipal census had pegged the number of wandering dogs in Thiruvananthapuram at a little over 12,000. Scarcity of water is also a significant issue.

The PFA hopes to put water pots for strays across the city, and its volunteers will throw food packets to dogs from their vehicles.

I.P. Binu, a municipal councillor, says he is in liaison with the Corporation and residents’ association to ensure street dogs are fed.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dog-days-are-here-for-strays/article31192657.ece

Mr. Mishra had recently visited Singapore and was asked to remain in home isolation for 14 days on his return on March 19.

However, he reportedly left for his home in Uttar Pradesh the same day without informing Health Department officials and the District Collector.

181,2020/03/28,Kole farmers heave a sigh of relief,"Harvesting of 5,800 hectares of kole fields before April 15

The uncertainty over kole fields in the district has finally been resolved. The district authorities have initiated steps to harvest paddy from kole fields before April 15.

Farmers of Ponnani-Thrissur kole fields were a worried lot after the announcement of the national lockdown as it stood in the way of the harvest. While harvesting was completed in 3,600 hectares, paddy was ready to be harvested in another 5,800 hectares.

Unavailability of harvesting machines was another issue. Farmers used to bring machines mostly from Tamil Nadu. Most machine operators are also from Tamil Nadu. Incidentally, they have all gone home in the wake of COVID-19 spread, and they are not inclined to return in view of the current situation.

At the same time, any delay in harvesting will cause huge loss to farmers. Summer rain and bird attacks add to their concern.

For the record, the Chief Minster had recently announced paddy harvesting as an essential service. He also said that restrictions on inter-State borders would not affect the arrival of harvest machines from Tamil Nadu.

Minister for Local Self Governments A.C. Moideen, District Collector S. Shanavas, Kole Development Authority officials, and Padasekhara Samitis discussed the issue here on Thursday.

Around 50 combined harvesting machines of Kerala Agro Industries Corporation will be despatched to the fields for harvesting, the Minister said. Some samitis have arranged their own harvesting machines. Considering the urgency of the matter, harvesting will be allowed from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Machine operators will strictly go by the COVID-19 safety protocols. They will be provided with food and accommodation. Special passes will be issued for transporting fuel for the machines.

The harvested paddy will be shifted to mills without delay. The Agriculture Department and local bodies will make alternative arrangements in case of emergency situations like rain. In such a scenario, paddy will be stored in local schools or halls. The district administration will make arrangements to address shortage of workers to shift paddy to mills.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dwvua7/article31187718.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvtrpullazhiKKN-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kole-farmers-heave-a-sigh-of-relief/article31187719.ece

Dear Prathiksha,

Ivey Business School – University of Western Ontario, Schulich School of Business – York University, Rotman School of Management – University of Tornoto, Desautels Faculty of Management – McGill University, Sauder School of Business – University of British Columbia are some of Canada’s leading MBA schools. Each have their own admissions criteria and hence, it is best if you go through their individual websites and shortlist the course/s that interest you and start a dialogue with the admissions office, at your earliest.

I will be completing my class X this month , and I am interested in Astrophysics. What are the courses I should choose, and the exams I should appear for? What are the options I have? — Krishna Sai

Dear Krishna,

Astrophysics is a highly demanding and a competitive field. You are making an early start, but it always helps to stay focused. You will need PCM in your XI and XII and then get an admission in Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST) through JEE, after class XII. Check if you can join local astronomy clubs and participate in related events for aspiring astrophysicists, to meet people in the field and develop an understanding of the scientific community.

I would like to know which stream I should opt for in class XI to pursue this career. Also, what should I pursue after completing class XII? — Karthikay Agrawal.

Dear Karthikay,

You can opt for any stream in class XI and XII. Make sure to take Arts as an elective subject, however, to hone your creativity and stay connected. After class XII, shortlist the right college based on course structure, faculty, institute infrastructure, and so on. Visit a few interesting animation college websites, checkout their courses and talk to their admission officers before you make your final decision. There are many Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) course choices for undergraduation — Aanimation, Multimedia and Animation, Multimedia production and Technology (Hons), Digital Art and Technology (Hons), Integrated Animation, Creative Animation Production, Animation and VFX, to mention a few.

I have scored 49% in my undergraduate in B.A in Sociology, political science and economics, and want to apply in DU LLB. But the minimum percentage required for general category is 50% aggregate. Is there any way through which my problem could be resolved? — Sian Morgan

Dear Sian,

As you have missed the admission criteria by a mere 1%, I would suggest that you go and meet the admissions officer personally and plead and request. Hope that they have a one-off concession and consider your case. Best wishes.

184,2020/03/28,Stricken labourers in Kerala scramble to return to T.N.,"100 stopped at border so far; many fled govt. shelters, fearing further restrictions due to COVID-19 threat

Amid the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases and the lack of jobs in Kerala, migrant workers have been attempting to cross the border to return to their native place in Tamil Nadu.

The labourers who have been stopped by the Tamil Nadu police at the inter-state border in Coimbatore range from those who had been travelling in an ambulance to a group of people who were walking along the railway tracks.

Thus far, the police have stopped around 100 persons, who had attempted to cross the border after escaping from the shelters set up by the Kerala government at various places in Palakkad district. On Friday, the police stopped as many as 25 persons who were walking on the railway track with the aim of reaching Coimbatore.

“These are people in the unorganised sector who don’t have jobs due to the national lockdown. A majority of them were provided shelter in community halls and other facilities in Palakkad district. Fearing further restrictions, they attempted to cross the border,” said an officer involved in monitoring at the Walayar checkpost.

Border checks

Officials from the Revenue, Police and Health Departments have been posted at major inter-state borders, including Walayar in Coimbatore, to check vehicles and screen passengers.

“Some workers attempted to cross the border by walking through jungles and bushes, before getting caught. They were afraid of the screening at the border. Transportation was arranged for many workers who returned from Kerala, after verification of documents and screening by the Health Department,” said Thooyamani Vellaisamy, Inspector, K.G. Chavadi police station.

No ID proof

According to Mr. Vellaisamy, those who had been sent back to Kerala included workers who escaped from shelters and people who did not have any ID proof.

“This was done in coordination with officials in Kerala as there should be no room for controversy,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/6sm0c3/article31195225.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29WORKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/stricken-labourers-in-kerala-scramble-to-return-to-tn/article31195226.ece
185,2020/03/28,COVID-19 cases climb to 42 in State; Chennai accounts for 17,"Of the four fresh cases, one does not have a travel history to an affected country

Four more persons have tested positive for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the State. With this, Tamil Nadu has a total of 42 COVID-19 cases, including two persons who were discharged after treatment and another who died.

On Saturday, the Health Department said a 42-year-old man, a resident of Kumbakonam, returned from West Indies via Doha. He tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted at the Government Medical College Hospital in Thanjavur. A total of 187 persons with whom he had come into contact have been traced.

A 49-year-old man, who is a resident of Katpadi, had returned from the U.K. and was admitted to Christian Medical College, Vellore. He had travelled to the country via Dubai. As many as 131 of his contacts have been traced.

The third patient — a 60-year-old man from Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar —also tested positive and was admitted to the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai. Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said the patient did not have a travel history to an affected country, but the authorities had found that he had come into contact with a person who had returned from abroad.

A 25-year-old man, a resident of West Mambalam in Chennai with a travel history to the U.S., also tested positive and was admitted to Global Hospital.

Dr. Rajesh said 11 of the 41 cases (at the time of speaking to reporters) had no travel history, and the authorities were tracing the source of infection.

Chennai accounted for the highest number of cases in the State. Seventeen of the 42 patients were from the city.

Stage 2

Dr. Rajesh said the State was in stage 2 of COVID-19 transmission. “We want to prevent the progression to stage 3, that is community spread of COVID-19,” she said. Stage 2 is when the infection is transmitted to the first-degree contacts of the COVID-19 positive patient (with travel history), she added.

“Many countries have tested many samples. For instance, if a person has returned from a foreign country and we test him/her today, he/she may test negative and may not have symptoms. But in the next 14 days, the person could develop symptoms on any day and turn positive. But once they test negative, they will not continue to be under home quarantine and would move outside. This is why our team of doctors carefully decided when to test. There are guidelines on when to test,” she said.

As of Saturday, 43,537 passengers were under home quarantine.

The number of persons admitted to hospitals remained the same as on Friday, at 277.

From 1,243 on Friday, the total number of samples sent for testing went up to 1,500. Of these, 65 samples were being processed, according to the bulletin issued by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine.

During the 21-day lockdown, the department was working on the “expand, train and deploy” strategy, Dr. Rajesh said. The department is expanding the bed strength in isolation wards across the State. “Presently, there are 17,000 beds in isolation facilities. An action plan is being readied to expand their number to the maximum. Next, doctors are being trained. This includes those in the reserve force, volunteering doctors, AYUSH and non-clinical doctors. The public health force is involved in disinfection activities at the field level,” she explained.

As of now, there are 10 testing facilities in the government and four in the private sector. Measures are being taken to increase the testing capacity across the State. The quarantine facilities are also being augmented.

Apart from Block B of Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, special COVID-19 isolation facilities have been established at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital. Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar inspected both the facilities on Saturday.

Underlying conditions

Dr. Rajesh said that three persons, including a two-year-old, who died on Saturday after being admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital in Kanniyakumari, had underlying conditions.

Their samples had been lifted to carry out tests for COVID-19, and the results were awaited, she added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/saxkq7/article31195220.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29ERODE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-cases-climb-to-42-in-state-chennai-accounts-for-17/article31195221.ece
186,2020/03/28,Growing health infrastructure to combat COVID-19,"Existing hospitals being converted into special facilities

The Health Department seems to have embarked on a massive infrastructure upgradation mission in order to be prepared to treat all patients who test positive for COVID-19. Much of the effort is dedicated towards converting existing hospital infrastructure into special COVID-19 centres, aided by the fact that the number of both outpatients and inpatients in government hospitals has come down drastically.

Following the declaration of the Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital in Omandurar as a COVID-19 hospital, announcements have been made to convert the ESI Hospital in Coimbatore into a specialised unit. The IRT Hospital in Perundurai, which has already dedicated some beds towards the purpose, will also be turned into a dedicated unit to treat COVID-19 soon. One patient was admitted to the Omandurar hospital and tested positive after showing symptoms at the outpatient unit there.

Meanwhile, at Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, in the new CRRI quarters that contain individual rooms with wash units, a 200-bed unit will be set up, with cots and oxygen pipelines. This will be completed in a couple of days, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said.

At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, another 200-bed exclusive COVID-19 unit had been set up, with about 100 ventilators. In collaboration with Sastra University, ventilator splitters that will help support four patients had been installed, Dr. Vijayabaskar said.

Orders have been placed for five lakh N95 masks from China through the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation, he added. “It has been relatively easy to do this, because our OP (outpatient) attendance has dropped to a fourth of the usual figure and the number of IPs (inpatients) has also come down,” the Minister explained.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5p6a5e/article30682597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29JANTH--HOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/growing-health-infrastructure-to-combat-covid-19/article31195210.ece
187,2020/03/28,A business that’s no longer blooming,"Flowers left to wilt as farmers are unable to transport them to markets amid lockdown

G. Natarajan, a marigold farmer at Sethupakkam village in Tiruvallur district, is normally busy heaping up the flowers that have been plucked from his field and are ready to be sent to various markets. But this season, he is confined to his house, filled with worry about the fate of the flowers cultivated in his field, as he has been unable to find vehicles to transport them.

Acres of unharvested marigold and jasmine have been wilting in many parts of Tiruvallur district this month, as farmers have no means to transport them due to the country-wide lockdown that has been imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Mr. Natarajan said he had cultivated marigold and jasmine on his one-acre field. He usually transports his flowers to the market at Tamaraipakkam Road junction or the one in Koyambedu using a two-wheeler or a mini-truck. “But now, the nearby markets are closed. I was turned away a few days ago from our main road. I have no option but to let the flowers wilt,” he said.

On an average, marigold would fetch ₹20-₹40 per kg and jasmine ₹100 per kg during the season. Many farmers source marigold saplings from Hosur and cultivate them in villages around Periapalayam and Tamaraipakkam.

V. Gangadharan, a marigold farmer in Kadarvedu village, said, “We harvest a minimum of 20-30 kg of jasmine in half-an-acre of land every day, and around 350 kg of marigold in half-an-acre of land on alternate days. We are planning to wait another 4-5 days to harvest marigold or allow them to wilt and turn them into compost.” Every farmer would have to bear a loss of at least ₹90,000 per acre as there are no takers and no transport facility to reach the city market. Groundnut and chillies are also waiting to be harvested, but they still have takers and can be stored for a longer period of time, he added.

Wholesale flower traders in Koyambedu have sought permission from the police and the Greater Chennai Corporation to source a third of the usual load from Monday. The Koyambedu wholesale market receives rose, jasmine and marigold from Hosur, Salem and Tiruvallur.

S. Mukkaiya, president, Koyambedu Wholesale Flowers Market Merchants’ Association, said, “The wholesale market has been permitted to function from 4 a.m. to noon. We have asked the police to allow farmers to bring flowers on two-wheelers. Sales have dropped by 50%.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vor6tv/article31195194.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29FLOWER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/a-business-thats-no-longer-blooming/article31195195.ece

189,2020/03/28,COVID-19’s gut connection,"In the wake of the present the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a much-needed increase in awareness among the general public of the importance of handwashing, social distancing and observing cough and sneeze etiquette. Observing a healthy ‘toilet hygiene’ must also be stressed, in view of the fact that COVID-19 affects the gastrointestinal tract too.

Most of us are aware that the COVID-19 presents with symptoms such as fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.

What is to be noted is that recent scientific data suggests that nearly 50% of the COVID-19 patients present with predominant digestive symptoms as their primary complaint.

The digestive symptoms include lack of appetite (83.8%), loose stools (29.3%), vomiting (0.8%) and abdominal pain (0.4%).

Although these patients usually do have coexisting respiratory complaints as well, a few of them (3%) can present with only digestive symptoms without any respiratory symptoms.

It appears that patients who report gastrointestinal symptoms usually have a more severe course of the disease and consequently a poorer outcome, compared to patients with COVID-19 infection without gastrointestinal symptoms.

As the disease progresses in severity, digestive symptoms also increases.

Shed in stools

Scientific studies have proven that apart from nasal and respiratory secretions, the COVID-19 virus is actively shed in the stools of infected patients. This shedding may continue to occur for as long as five weeks after the patient recovers from the respiratory symptoms.

In this regard, besides the already known measures such as avoidance of close contact, social distancing, observing cough/sneeze hygiene etiquette and wearing personal protective gear, the importance of a proper handwashing protocol, especially after bowel movements, must be stressed. Since there is a likelihood of bioaerosols being released in the air during flushing of the toilet (toilet plume), it is advisable to ensure that the commode lid is closed before flushing.

Avoiding the lavatory immediately after it has been used by another may also reduce exposure to the virus.

Since infected individuals may be asymptomatic and testing everyone would not be feasible, assuming everyone to be potentially infective and observing the mentioned personal hygiene measures universally may be the best way to break the chain of infection.

190,2020/03/28,State should take care of sanitation workers in the unorganised sector: Unions,"“The State government must ensure protective gear for the sanitation workers but the public should also contribute”

The work of tireless sanitation workers, who risk their life dealing with disposal of waste during and after disasters, is often forgotten once normal life returns in the society.

When Chennai was wrecked by Tsunami in 2004, floods in 2015 and Varda cyclone in 2016, sanitation workers were brought from other districts to help clean up the city. Now, with coronavirus threatening to wreak havoc, the role of sanitation workers becomes important once again.

While Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has announced a ₹500 crore package including a one-month salary incentive to all health workers – including sanitation workers – to combat the COVID-19 spread, sanitation worker unions have said that the State government should not leave out sanitation workers in the unorganised sector who don’t fall under permanent, contract-workers, consolidated pay workers.

Gollapalli Israel, Honorary President, Tamil Nadu Conservancy Workers Federation, appreciated Chief Minister’s move to provide one month salary but insisted that the State Government must take into account all sanitation workers without leaving anyone out.

“When we think of sanitation workers, we only think of those working in government hospitals or cleaning the roads. There are innumerable workers working in places such as police stations, private hospitals, in Panchayats and municipalities. In this time of Covid-19 scare, many are asked to clean toilets in homes… we request the State government to provide one month salary to all of them and not leave out anyone,” he said. He further said that the State government must reinvigorate the now defunct Scavengers Welfare Board.

Madras Corporation Red Flag Union on March 17 appealed to the Chennai Corporation to suspend the process of separating degradable and non-degradable wastes to protect the workers against Corona virus.

“Around 5,000 tonnes of waste used by the public is being separated by the workers. Since there is a possibility of them contracting the virus, the Chennai Corporation should suspend this activity,” said P. Sreenivasulu, general secretary, Madras Corporation Red Flag Union.

Samuel Velankanni, State Convenor, Safai Karamchari Andolan, demanded that the State ensure protective gear for the sanitation workers, but also urged the public to do their bit. “I met a few workers even on Friday and they say that PPEs are only given when the officials are there for inspection. They say that availability of PPEs is not consistent,” he said. He also appealed to general public to be considerate in this hour of crisis.

“People should be responsible and not think that someone will come and clean the place. For example, they must segregate waste and dispose it off responsibly, instead of just throwing the waste outside. They should keep their surroundings clean and help the workers at this time.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/d960s3/article28715901.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th26-vellore-caGL667912D5jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/state-should-take-care-of-sanitation-workers-in-the-unorganised-sector-unions/article31192954.ece

Southern Railway will convert some of its coaches into isolation wards as part of the initiatives to combat COVID-19.

Carriage Works, Loco Works in Chennai and Golden Rock Workshop in Tiruchi commenced work on the prototype models on Saturday. According to Chief Public Relations Officer B. Guhanesan, the models would be ready in one week’s time and a decision on making more such isolation coaches and distribution aspects would be taken by the Railway Board.

While railways already have huge hospital facilities equipped with ICU and isolation wards facilities at all divisional headquarters - Chennai, Madurai, Salem, Tiruchi, Palghat and Thiruvananthapuram - covering Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and parts of Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, the decision to convert coaches into isolation wards taken by the Ministry of Railways to meet any exigency that might arise later, railway sources said.

Existing Sleeper Class coaches were being modified into isolation wards and the number of berths (beds) could vary depending upon the model and need. One coach was being designed with nine beds with provision for life-saving equipment, a senior railway official said adding that the coaches would only serve as isolation wards to start with though an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on wheels would also be possible.

The Indian Railways that operates over 13,000 trains across the country has suspended passenger train operations till April 14 to control the spread of COVID19. While production units and factories have been tasked with the projects of manufacturing medical equipment and consumables like ventilators, face masks and hand sanitisers required to treat patients infected by the novelcorona virus, the Zonal Railways are working on converting coaches into temporary isolation wards or ICUs. These decisions were taken at a high level meeting chaired by Union Minister of Railways Piyush Goyal in New Delhi recently, the sources said.

The Integral Coach Factory in Chennai that is making hand sanitisers and face masks has been approached by the Tamil Nadu State government for supply of the consumables in large quantities. The Golden Rock Workshop in Tiruchi was fabricating steel cots and bedside lockers for COVID19 patients, the sources said.

""It is possible to move the converted coaches to a desired location. We also have Accident Relief Medical Equipment Vans which are coaches equipped with life saving medicines and surgical facilities.

With the closure of State-owned TASMAC liqour outlets in the State, persons addicted to alcohol stand the risk of developing withdrawal symptoms that need to be treated appropriately and immediately.

In view of this, the District Mental Health Programme (DMHP) has issued a set of guidelines for medical officers and district psychiatrists to assess and treat persons seeking help.

Officials said that persons addicted to alcohol are at risk of developing withdrawal symptoms following reduction or stoppage of alcohol consumption. They may experience bouts of depression or anxiety, mental and physical exhaustion, mood swings, irrational thoughts, unexplainable physical pain, irritability and sleeplessness, and there was an urgent need to treat them.

“If left untreated, it could lead to a lot of complications. So, it should be treated properly, immediately and adequately, and this should be done by professionals. Some persons may go on forced abstinence. Some of them may develop complications such as delirium and psychotic symptoms, and some may not. The Institute of Mental Health is open round the clock with its counselling services, and tele-counselling is available at the district-level.,” an official said.

The DMHP has written to the Directorate of Medical Education and Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services to rope in medical officers working in primary health centres, district psychiatrists working in the district headquarters hospitals and under DMHP/faculty members in the departments of psychiatry in government medical colleges. They may be instructed to follow the guidelines furnished by the DMHP whenever any patient seeks their advice.

Those in need of help can seek advice through the State health helpline at 104, or through telemedicine or contact the medical officers/district psychiatrists/faculty members of departments of psychiatry.

The district-level health officials have been asked to publicise the contact details of these medical officers to enable the patients to contact them. Those who need treatment could be provided for their safe and consistent management of uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal.

The guidelines for clinical assessment of patients with alcohol withdrawal symptoms includes a set of questions such as : What is your drinking pattern and has it changed, have you ever experienced blackouts, what do you experience when you stop drinking, when was your last drink, have you ever had delirium tremens, seizure or hallucinations, have you ever undergone detoxification treatment before, and how many times, do you have medical problems such as liver disease, pancreatitis or intestinal bleeding.

The medical officers were also provided with Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, a scale used to measure alcohol withdrawal symptoms to assess the patients, and provide medication as per the severity -- mild, moderate or severe alcohol dependence.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/fthrv8/article31192479.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TASMAC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/with-no-liquor-available-during-lockdown-government-issues-guidelines-to-treat-persons-with-withdrawal-symptoms/article31192480.ece
196,2020/03/28,Officials check on migrant labourers after RJD leader’s tweet,"Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav had tweeted to the Chief Minister’s office, requesting him to ensure the safety of workers from Bihar stranded in Tiruppur during the lockdown

Following a tweet from Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav requesting the safety of migrant labourers from Bihar in Tiruppur amid the lockdown, the Tiruppur district administration swung into action and conducted inspections to check on their status.

On Friday evening, Mr. Yadav tweeted, “Respected @CMOTamilNadu, Diligent workers from Bihar, stranded in West Gowdan, Near Sumathi Hospital, Angeripalayam, Tirupur. Request you to kindly help them out with food and ration during the lock down time. @mkstalin (sic).”

In a similar tweet, he said that workers from Bihar are also stuck at Kozhipannai on Mangalam Road and attached a list of names. Responding to this tweet, District Collector K. Vijayakarthikeyan said that the district administration will follow up and “take necessary action.”

Speaking to The Hindu on Saturday, Mr. Vijayakarthikeyan said that officials from the Revenue Department visited Angeripalayam and Kozhipannai in the city on Friday evening. Nearly 400 workers from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal were found to be living in these two areas. “They had all the commodities, but not vegetables. That has been arranged,” he said.

Most of these workers are employed in garment companies across the district. While some companies have come forward to assist the workers during the lockdown period, the district administration “will fill in the gaps” by helping out the rest, Mr. Vijayakarthikeyan said.

Apart from the city, migrant workers from Jharkhand were found to be living in Uthukuli. It is estimated that nearly 700 migrant workers are stranded across Tiruppur district. “I have instructed all the Tahsildars to keep vigil,” Mr. Vijayakarthikeyan said, adding that the migrant workers could contact the district administration for assistance.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, through his official twitter handle, responded to Tejashwi Yadav by tweeting: “We have already informed the concerned officer. They are in safe hands. Thank you!”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/officials-check-on-migrant-labourers-after-rjd-leaders-tweet/article31191889.ece
197,2020/03/28,Private schools appeal for financial exemptions,"Schools say that as they had to shut down as part of the precautionary measures taken against COVID-19, they have not been able to collect full fees or complete the admission process

The Tamil Nadu Nursery, Primary, Matriculation, Higher Secondary and CBSE Schools association has submitted a representation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, appealing for financial exemptions.

“As a result of the preventive measures taken against the spread of COVID-19, we have closed our schools without conducting the final exams for our students from classes 1 to 9 and have not been able to collect the full fees from many students,” said K.R. Nandhakumar, State General Secretary of the association. Schools haven’t been able to complete the admission process as well, according to the members of the association.

In their representation, they have asked to be exempted from the levy of property tax for private educational institutions which is collected in Tamil Nadu. “Every year, we have been struggling to pay a large amount as property tax and we cannot charge more than the fees set by the government from our students as well,” Mr. Nandhakumar said.

Schools were working for less then a week in March before they had to shut down and Mr Nandhakumar said that they should be exempted from paying for the insurance, fitness certificates and road tax for their school vehicles, which will remain non-operational for the next three months.

The private schools have also asked for the release of funds under the Right To Education (RTE) Act for the last two academic years. In their representation, the association members have said that they are providing free education to nearly 7 lakh students under the RTE Act but have not yet been compensated for the same with the State Government’s share.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/private-schools-appeal-for-financial-exemptions/article31191779.ece
198,2020/03/28,"Revoke transfers of doctors, post to original locations at this time of crisis, says Doctors Association","The Federation of Government Doctors Association has appealed to the State government to re-post 135 doctors to their original places of work and use their services

The Federation of Government Doctors Association (FOGDA) has requested the State government to revoke the transfers of 135 doctors and post them to their original places of work.

The government had transferred the doctors and issued charge memos, for leading a week-long strike last year.

The Federation has decided to contribute a day’s salary to the Chief Minister’s relief fund for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) management.

“Healthcare providers are in the frontline of COVID-19 management. The government has recruited a little over 500 doctors on Friday to manage the crisis and they are being posted in their native districts due to the lockdown. This is a welcome move. But the 135 doctors, who were working in hospitals such as in Chennai, Salem, Tiruchi, Sivagangai, Dindigul and Tirunelveli, were transferred and posted in faraway hospitals, at least 400 km away from their original place of work, nearly five months ago,” one of the conveners of FOGDA said.

The association requested the government to re-post these doctors to their original locations and utilise their services at this time of crisis. Due to the lockdown, many of the doctors were finding it difficult to travel so far. This was because they have worked continuously and visit their homes once in a week, and during their off days, according to FOGDA conveners.

The association said the many of the 135 doctors, including 30 women, were specialists with a work experience of at least 15 years. All of them were working across the three directorates of public health, medical education and medical and rural health services.

It may be recalled that on February 28, the Madras High Court, while making it clear that doctors have no right whatsoever to go on strike, quashed the charge memos and transfer orders issued to them.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/revoke-transfers-of-doctors-post-to-original-locations-at-this-time-of-crisis-says-doctors-association/article31191681.ece
199,2020/03/28,"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister seeks ₹9,000 crore from PM Modi to combat COVID-19 and its aftermath","The expenditure out of this grant will also help pump the economy and lead to its revival, the Chief Minister said in his letter

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to grant ₹9,000 crore to Tamil Nadu and allocate a special grant of ₹1 lakh crore to the State governments to combat the COVID-19 disease and to deal with its aftermath.

In a letter to the Prime Minister, Mr. Palaniswami reiterated that this should be in addition to the other forms of financial transfers to the States envisaged in the Union Budget and can be financed by the Government of India borrowing from the Reserve Bank of India.

He wrote: “I request that the Government of India, in addition to permitting the additional borrowing by State Governments, should provide an aggregate amount of at least ₹1 lakh crore as a special grant to the State Governments to combat the COVID-19 virus and its aftermath. This needs to be in addition to the other forms of financial transfers to the States envisaged in the Union Budget and can be financed by the Government of India borrowing from the Reserve Bank of India.”

Mr. Palaniswami suggested that the funds can be distributed in proportion to the size of each state’s GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) to the national Gross Domestic Product.

“The expenditure out of this grant will also pump prime the economy and lead to its revival. I request that Tamil Nadu may be given a grant of ₹9000 crore under this special dispension,” he said.

While thanking the Prime Minister for announcing measures as part of Pradhan Mantri Graib Kalyan Yojana and liquidity and interest rate reduction measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India, Mr. Palaniswami pointed out that the responsibility of ensuring the lockdown in a strict manner and the welfare of the poor and the vulnerable falls on the State governments.

Mr. Palaniswami said that more relief measures would be needed in the coming days as States would incur expenditure to ramp up the availability of health infrastructure and medical supplies.

“Eventually, measures would also have to be taken to revive economic growth, assist various sectors to return to their growth trajectory and to stimulate consumption and investment demand. All governments will suffer substantial reductions in tax and revenue receipts and it would not be possible to step up revenue raising for a while. However, the expenditure needs and responsibilities will not wait,” he said.

Arguing that unconventional measures are required to revive the economy, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Mr. Palaniswami said that conventional economic doctrines and dogmas will need to be set aside temporarily.

In his letter on March 25 to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Palaniswami urged him to relax, as a one-time measure, the fiscal deficit limits of 3 percent of GSDP for 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 and permit additional borrowing of 33 percent above the level for the fiscal year 2019-20 may be allowed for 2020-21 to enable States to meet the additional expenditure requirements.

“While this will certainly help the States to immediately incur expenditure, States naturally have a limitation on how much they can borrow in the markets and will be crippled by massive repayment obligations if they borrow too much. But the onus on reviving the economy by fuelling consumption and investment falls on the Governments at this time,” he underlined.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/mbpkr7/article31191638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28MARTH--EDAPPADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-chief-minister-seeks-9000-crore-from-pm-modi-to-combat-covid-19-and-its-aftermath/article31191639.ece
200,2020/03/28,COVID-19: Folk artistes deprived of livelihood as all festivals cancelled,"Folk artistes in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Kanyakumari district depend upon the programmes in the summer months, which have now been cancelled

The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have touched every aspect in society today, leaving the world severely crippled by a virus.

Count among those affected, folk artistes in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Kanyakumari district -- all deprived of their livelihood, as all programmes booked for the Kodai—festival in the temples of folk deities in summer — March, April and May have been cancelled. Unlike other sections of the society, folk artistes depend only on Kodai to make a livelihood and the money earned during this season would enable them to see through the rest of the year.

“There will be more than 2,000 artistes in these districts who will now be unable to run their families. The government has issued identity cards and it should supply essential commodities and extend financial assistance to us,” said Kaniyaan Koothu artiste V. Muthuperumal, who was forced to cancel his daughter’s wedding because of the lockdown.

The possibility of postponing the festival is ruled out since the rainy season will not allow any celebration after May. If there is no rain, the festival season may extend only till June. Villages do not organise festivals after schools are re-opened for children.

Beginning March, they will have programmes from Monday to Wednesday and again between Thursday and Saturday. It will be a tightly-packed schedule for artistes of Kaniyaan koothu, Naiyandimelam, Villupattu, Thappattam and Karagam.

“Artistes generally borrow from money-lenders and they are also usually ready to lend since they are also aware of the potential of the season. Now, the epidemic has closed the prospect of borrowing money too,” said Nageswaram player and naiyandimelam artiste Panakudi R. Siva.

While Naiyandimelam artistes — who play the Nageswara and thavil — will be to sustain by performing for weddings, such an opportunity is totally denied to other artistes.

Mr. Siva said he is not sure whether the economic slowdown necessitated by the disease and lockdown could have en effect even next year.

“Organisers of the festival will not be in a position to collect the money as they do in normal times. The trend will reflect on our salaries and we will be forced to perform for lower amounts,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-folk-artistes-deprived-of-livelihood-as-all-festivals-cancelled/article31191476.ece
201,2020/03/28,COVID-19: Stalin demands all-party meeting through video-conferencing,"In a statement, he said confidence among the public could be built only if the ruling party and the Opposition worked together

DMK leader M.K. Stalin on Saturday urged Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to hold an all-party meeting, saying that the ruling party alone could not combat the epidemic caused by COVID-19.

In a statement, he said confidence among the public could be built only if the ruling party and the Opposition worked together.

“If there is a problem in holding an all party meeting because of the lockdown, it could be done through video-conferencing to get a clear idea about the situation across the State,” Mr Stalin said.

He said more and more people were affected by the disease and there was a problem in getting essential commodities because of the lockdown. “Misinformation about the disease also caused tension and panic among the people. People are afraid as they are leading a life without regular income,” he said.

203,2020/03/28,Nine more test positive for COVID-19; number of cases touches 38 in T.N.,"While six were in contact with patients, it is not known how the others got infected

In its highest single day increase so far, Tamil Nadu recorded nine more positive cases of COVID-19 on Friday. With this, the State has 38 cases of COVID-19.

Of the nine, six patients had come in contact with previously positive patients. However, the official bulletin issued by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine has no word on how three others contracted the infection — a 25-year-old woman, who worked in a mall and admitted to Government Hospital at Ariyalur, a 73-year-old woman from Pammal admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and a 39-year-old man from Anna Nagar, Chennai, at Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital.

Contacts traced

The department has traced the contacts of six patients.

According to the bulletin, two persons — a 42-year-old man and 46-year-old man — who were contacts of the two Thai nationals, who had tested positive earlier, are at IRT, Perundurai in Erode.

A 23-year-old man, a close contact of a 52-year-old woman of Purasawalkam who returned from the U.S., has tested positive and is at the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital.

A 22-year-old man and 44-year-old woman — both family contacts of the 54-year-old man who tested positive and later died at the Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai — have tested positive.

A 61-year-old man, a contact of the four Indonesian nationals who tested positive earlier, is under isolation at Government Medical College Hospital, Salem.

As on Friday, 277 persons were admitted to isolation wards of hospitals across the State.

204,2020/03/28,Youth show the way in caring for animals,"A group pools money and feeds the monkeys of Theerthamalai; a farmer too chips in

At a time when pets are being abandoned in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, a village near a pilgrimage site in Dharmapuri district is showing the way to care for animals.

The people of the village are doing it for the monkeys of Theerthamalai. A group of youth, supported by a largely caring society, has been diligently feeding the simians of Theerthamalai for a week now.

Theerthamalai hosts the famous Theerthagireeshwarar temple, which on an ordinary day, sees a turnout of 1,000 pilgrims. A week ago, the temple was closed. With the temple shut and the pilgrims, who fed the monkeys barred entry, hundreds of simians were facing starvation as devotees used to give them fruits.

Namadhu Theerthamalai, a group of local youth, started purchasing fruits for the monkeys. The group has been pooling in their meagre savings to purchase fruits from shops at discounted prices since Saturday. ““The monkeys were facing starvation having got used to regular supply of food, water, fruits and puffed rice from the pilgrims. The shops were looking at a loss with an imminent shutdown. We went ahead and bought apples and tomatoes for the monkeys from fruit stalls,” says Udhaya Kumar of Namadhu Theerthamalai. Soon, Udhaya Kumar and his friends reached out to farmers who were looking at fresh harvests that were unlikely to reach the market.

Karthik, a 28-year-old farmer of the neighbouring Kurumpatty village, offered muskmelon to feed monkeys. He gave away 500 kg of muskmelon, a part of an acre of his total three-acre harvest. “Karthik gave us some seven sacks of muskmelons and he joined us in the feeding sessions,” says Mr. Kumar.

For Mr. Karthik, that was the right thing to do. “I had one acre of muskmelon harvest left. This was the best thing to do, to feed the monkeys. I also distributed some to the houses in our village that was all locked up due to the curfew,” says Karthik.

This week, each day, the group went up Theerthamalai, lugging cartons of muskmelon, stopped at every stretch, and laid out the neatly cut fruits for the monkeys. They fed the monkeys to their heart’s content. For now, Mr. Kumar is glad that they have enough fruits for Saturday. “From Sunday, we’ll find a way to feed them,” he says.

Every now and then, there is an occasional visitor from the foot of Theerthamalai hill, who climbs up with curd rice cooked to feed an unknown monkey of Theerthamalai.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/of7b03/article31187193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THTHEERTHAMALAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/youth-show-the-way-in-caring-for-animals/article31187194.ece
205,2020/03/28,COVID-19 hospital at Omandurar to have 500 beds: CM,"3,000 medical staff appointed; 200 ambulances to be added to existing fleet

On a day the State saw nine confirmed cases of COVID-19, the government scaled up efforts to battle the pandemic with Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announcing that the first exclusive government hospital for the SARS-CoV-2 patients in Tamil Nadu at Block B of Government Medical College Hospital at Omandurar will have 500 beds, instead of the planned 350.

About 15,000 beds have been readied for handling people with symptoms of COVID-19, he added.

The government also appointed 530 doctors, 1,000 nurses and 1,508 lab technicians through the Medical Recruitment Board. The Chief Minister directed the newly recruited medical staff to join service within three days of receiving their appointment orders.

Mr. Palaniswami sanctioned induction of 200 new ambulances to the state’s medical fleet. Besides the control room operated by the Health Department, the one in the Secretariat would be declared as ‘Chief Control Room.’

The Chief Minister told journalists that Tamil Nadu was now in Stage 1 of the global pandemic. “We are moving towards Stage 2. We have taken all steps to prevent it. We want to control it in stage 1 itself. This can be done if people cooperate with us [by staying indoors],” he said.

Technically, Stage 1 is primarily imported cases, i.e. persons who travelled to other countries and contracted the infection. Stage 2 is when people who come in contact with the infected person test positive.

The government reiterated that persons who returned from abroad since February 15 and those who were in physical contact with them should go under self-quarantine.

“They have to intimate this information to officials from the corporation and municipalities,” an official release said.

Calls PM

Meanwhile, Mr. Palaniswami informed Prime Minister Narendra Modi over phone of the precautionary and relief measures being taken against COVID-19 in the State.

An official release said Mr. Modi reiterated that the lockdown be observed strictly, while ensuring the public had access to essential commodities and services.

206,2020/03/28,"Annual muster for pensioners in July, August, September from this year","Association made a representation to the govt. in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, summer

The State government on Thursday specified July, August and September as months every year when the State government pensioners and family pensioners could produce their life certificates to the Pension Disbursing Officer concerned for annual mustering. Earlier, they were to produce their life certificates in April, May and June during a year.

The State government's decision followed a representation from Tamil Nadu Retired Officials’ Association and the eventual request from the Commissioner of Treasuries and Accounts seeking to change the time period for mustering in the present scenario and to avoid peak summer season.

A senior official said there have been requests that it was difficult for pensioners and family pensioners to produce their life certificates during summer. “We have changed the timing only to suit their convenience. The change will come into effect from this year onwards,” the official told The Hindu.

There are about 7.3 lakh pensioners in Tamil Nadu, including State civil pensioners, teacher pensioners, civil family pensioners, teacher family pensioners and other categories, including ex gratia pensioners as of March 2019, according to data available with the Finance Department.

“If any pensioner, including family pensioner, fails to do so (produce life certificate any time between July, August and September every year), the Pension Disbursing Authority shall call for the personal appearance in October and pension/family pension will be stopped from November onwards for those pensioners, including family pensioners, who neither appear directly for mustering nor furnish life certificate,” the G.O. in this regard said.

Pensioners who retired from the State government service, including family pensioners, are to furnish life certificate, non-employment certificate and non-remarriage/non-marriage certificate every year to the pension disbursing officer concerned. If they failed to do so, the Pension Disbursing Officer concerned would call for the annual mustering of the pensioners/family pensioners.

If the pensioners/family pensioners neither produced certificates nor appeared for annual mustering, the Pension Disbursing Officer would stop the payment of pension and it would resume only on production of the necessary certificates or after the pensioners' personal appearance before the officer.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/annual-muster-for-pensioners-in-july-august-september-from-this-year/article31187830.ece

The Vellore Corporation cleaned the old bus stand for setting up shops with 10feet X 10feet, with one-and-a-half-metre social distancing marks. The workers used disinfectants to sanitise the shopping and storage areas of the 150 shops. However, people once again thronged the Nethaji Market as they were not sure of the time when the new arrangement would come into force.

There are about 150 retail vendors and as many flower merchants in the Nethaji Market, but only seven shops were open. Tomato, garlic, papaya, plantain, oranges were on sale, but there was enormous demand for other vegetables, which are being supplied from farms in Anaikattu, Katpadi and Gudiyatham blocks.

Meanwhile, the district administration has allowed the shoppers to open their retail outlets between 6 a.m. and noon and the arrangement would be in force from Saturday.

Uzhavar Sandhais (farmer’s market) at playgrounds in Thorappadi Boys HSS, Katpadi Don Bosco School, Gudiyatham Municipality HSS,and Pernambut Concordia HSS would also function between 6 a.m. and noon.

208,2020/03/28,Chennai Corporation removes quarantine sticker from Kamal Haasan’s Alwarpet residence,"Authorities said the sticker had been pasted as actor Gautami had returned from Dubai recently, and her passport had this address

Chennai Corporation, on Saturday, removed home quarantine stickers from the residence of actor Kamal Haasan, after a few workers of the health department had pasted the stickers based on an old address in a passport, as received from immigration authorities.

Chennai Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash instructed health officials to remove the sticker from the actor’s Alwarpet residence on Saturday. “Our staff pasted the quarantine sticker at Kamal Haasan residence because actor Gautami has returned from Dubai recently and her passport has this address,” he explained later.

Actor Gautami is reportedly currently residing in Sholinganallur zone in the southern region of the city, according to Chennai Corporation sources.

Chennai Corporation Deputy Commissioner (Health) Madusudhan Reddy said, “The Corporation received the address from the airport. It is based on the address given in the passport of actor Gautami, who travelled abroad recently. Our people ended up going and pasting the quarantine stickers at the address in Alwarpet given in the passport. We have traced the present address of actor Gautami in Sholinganallur,” said Mr. Reddy. The health department of Chennai Corporation will ask actor Gautami to be on home quarantine, officials said.

In the quarantine sticker pasted, the officials had mentioned a quarantine period from March 10 to April 6.

Chennai Corporation has collected the data of persons who returned from abroad from immigration authorities and asked them to be on home quarantine. But many of the addresses are outdated, primarily on account of people shifting residences.

According to estimates, less than 51% of the residents in Chennai own houses in the city. Many of residents who have passports are likely to have shifted residences. Chennai Corporation officials have started tracing the current address of residents who have travelled abroad.

In a statement, Kamal Haasan, actor and president of Makkal Needhi Maiam, said, “To all those who are concerned. A big thank you for your love. Based on the notice stuck outside my house, news has been spread saying that I have been quarantined. But, most of you already know that I have not been living there for the past few years and the Makkal Needhi Maiam party office has been functioning from there. So, the news that I have been quarantined is not true. As a precautionary measure, I have undertaken social distancing as I requested the public too. I would again reemphasise all of us to undertake social distancing as a precautionary measure. I also request all news agencies to verify news before breaking it so that fake news does not get spread.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/33h6j0/article31190915.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28MARTH-KAMAL,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/chennai-corporation-removes-quarantine-sticker-from-kamal-haasans-alwarpet-residence/article31190916.ece
209,2020/03/28,"Kannada actor Chandan Achar: 'This is different from Bigg Boss, now we are living in fear and anxiety'","'Kirik Party' actor talks about lock-down, films, and online theatre activities

Being locked up in a house is not new for Kannada film actor Chandan Achar. The actor, who made it big with the hit film Kirik Party, was also one of the most popular participants of Bigg Boss Kannada Season 7. He lived in the house for 14 weeks for the show and now is locked up at his home. “The difference is that in Bigg Boss, we were a group of people, working, cooking, doing the various tasks we were assigned. Now we are living by ourselves, in fear and anxiety,” says the actor who had a good 2019. Chemistry Of Kariyappa, where he plays a leading man was a hit and the year ended with another blockbuster, Avane Sriman Narayana, where he shares the screen with Rakshit Shetty.

His next solo venture, Mangalwara Raja Dina, was supposed to release this month, but the production team has stalled the release, due to Covid-19.

Yet, the actor stays positive. “These are difficult times. Even we actors should first think of lives rather than just fame and films. Lives are more important now.”

Though Chandan has signed a couple of films, he believes this is “not the right time to talk about it as there are more urgent concerns for everyone. Earlier this year we read about this virus creating havoc in China. Now it has reached our country. I don’t think any one imagined that we all could be locked down in our homes like this. But who can stand the fury of nature? I feel this is a wake up call from nature telling each of us to change our lifestyle and respect it. This is also a warning telling us to take care of ourselves and our environment.”

Being an active theatre person, this lock-down has taken its toll on the actor. “Theatre is a social activity. Sadly, we cannot meet.” Chandan says he and a group of theatre artistes from Bengaluru and Delhi have started an online theatre activity called, WeMovetheatre on FaceBook.

“This was started on World Theatre Day. Anyone can join us online and read out a line or a part from their favourite play, make a two-minute video of it and post it on We MoveTheatre page. We will choose a particular day and host all these videos on our FB page. This is our way of keeping ourselves involved. We are all social beings and cannot live in isolation. This is our small initiative to keep some theatre activity alive within the walls of our homes using online platforms.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bmjddj/article31190601.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGSSRCHANDAN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kannada-actor-chandan-achar-this-is-different-from-bigg-boss-now-we-are-living-in-fear-and-anxiety/article31190602.ece
210,2020/03/28,‘Maska’ movie review: Saccharine sweet and cloyingly safe,"The Netflix film opts for the convenience and comfort of the conventional than the uncertainty, trials and tribulations of the radical

There’s a scene in Maska where the lead Rumi (Prit Kamani) is ticked off by a judge, Boman Irani (playing himself) in an acting competition. All for trying too hard to act — zyada hi mehnat (don’t overdo it), as he puts it. The film — about Rumi wanting to let go of his family legacy in order to become an actor — is also something like that. The well-meaning tribute to Mumbai’s iconic Irani cafés, is sweet but cloyingly so. The homage to the Parsi community gets too affected and contrived than spontaneous, and prefers to remain on the surface instead of taking a deep dive.

No wonder for a long stretch at the start there is a sense of disconnect, whether it is with individuals or their relationships with each other. Manisha Koirala plays Diana, Rumi's mother, with daintily over-the-top eccentricity (can any Parsi not be done that way?) Or, for that matter Javed Jaffrey as the late father Rustom. When will portraying Parsis go beyond accents and catch phrases? The Punjabiyat of Rumi's girlfriend Mallika Chopra (Nikita Dutta) feels just as practiced. Kamani comes up with a sincere turn but its Abhishek Banerjee in a walk-on role as a casting director who livens things up.

Maska Director: Neeraj Udhwani

Cast: Manisha Koirala, Prit Kamani, Javed Jaffrey, Nikita Dutta, Shirley Setia

Storyline: Young Rumi wants to let go of his family legacy to pursue his dream of becoming an actor

Run time: 1 hour 51 minutes

Things take a heartwarming turn somewhere in the middle as Rumi battles between café and career but soon keels over to far-out sentimentality. Eventually, my big grouse with the film is that it opts for the convenience and comfort of the conventional than the uncertainty, trials and tribulations of the radical. Be it home, family and legacy, dreams and calling or even when it comes to matters of heart. It opts for the straight and the narrow and plays too safe. Why does preserving history have to be a burden for the future? Why can’t your heritage and individual identity co-exist? Why can't dreams be realigned better with reality?

In these home-bound times, the film does leave you feeling nostalgic for old Mumbai houses you used to encounter on walks. Most of all, it ignites a craving for those soft buns slathered with mounds of butter and the extra sweet tea at Irani cafés. And also those small cups of Bournvita, tea and coffee sold on cycle-carts late into the night and the wee hours of the morning in a city that never sleeps. Rather never used to sleep. Hope it soon wakes up again.

Aziz Mirza’s 1989 series Circus, which introduced the world to Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, is making a comeback on Doordarshan.

“Shekharan is BACK on @DDNational! Friends, #StayAtHome and watch your favourite @iamsrk’s #Circus - TV Series (1989) - From 28th March at 8 pm on @DDNational” DD National tweeted.

Circus, directed by Mirza and Kundan Shah, marked Shah Rukh’s entry into the entertainment industry. The show also featured the likes of Renuka Shahane and actor-director Ashutosh Gowarikar.

The show will re-run at a time when the country is witnessing a 21-day lockdown to combat the spread of coronavirus. The virus, which originated in China, has claimed the lives of 19 people in India and infected close to 900.

Besides “Circus”, Rajit Kapur-starrer detective drama “Byomkesh Bakshi” is also returning to Doordarshan.

“MUST WATCH -#RajitKapur in a role with which he will be associated forever! Detective show #ByomkeshBakshi from 28th March at 11 am only on @DDNational” the broadcaster tweeted.

Based on the famous Bengali sleuth character created by Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay, the show ran from 1993 to 1997. It also featured KK Raina as Bakshi’s sidekick Ajit Kumar Banerji.

Earlier, it was announced the cult hit mythological series —“Ramayana” and “Mahabharat” —will re-run on Doordarshan and DD Bharati, respectively.

“Ramayan”, based on Lord Ram’s life, was first aired on Doordarshan in 1987 and attained a cult status. It featured Arun Govil in the role of Lord Ram and Deepika Chikhaliya as Sita. It was brought to the screen by Sagar Arts.

The other series “Mahabharat”, based on the eponymous epic, first aired in 1988 and was a show that made many actors attain iconic status.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/j3buse/article31190293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/shahrukhkhancircus0,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/shah-rukh-khans-1989-tv-show-circus-to-air-on-doordarshan-from-sunday/article31190294.ece
212,2020/03/28,Dairy industry in Telangana facing a piquant situation,"People are not allowing the delivery boys into their premises

The dairy industry in the State is facing a peculiar situation following the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19).

Though there are no constraints faced in respect of production and ensuring supply of milk, the industry is finding it difficult to dispatch the products to all the localities, especially gated communities, where people are not allowing the delivery boys into their premises.

Consumption

The State’s consumption of milk is pegged around 68 lakh litres a day of which the HMDA area accounts for almost half, over 30 lakh litres.

Police sensitised

There are 10 major dairies engaged in production and supply of milk with three major brands - Heritage, Vijaya and Jersey - catering to a major chunk of the demand.

Interestingly, it was the police who stopped the delivery boys from reaching their destinations initially, but they had been sensitised since and are allowing milk vans, forming part of essential commodities, freely.

The industry is said to be faced with difficulty in reaching out its products as residents and residential welfare associations are not allowing the delivery boys inside.

Coupled with this, the elderly vendors who sell milk sachets in different parts of the twin cities are preferring to stay at home following the advisory given by the government from time to time.

Stable demand

“The problem now is with last mile connectivity. There is a general fear in society about the impact of the virus. There was spurt in the demand during the first two days, but the demand remained stable ever since,” Telangana State Dairy Development Cooperative Federation managing director G. Srinivas Rao told The Hindu.

The demand had in fact come down in the past couple of days.

“There is a drop in demand of 3 lakh litres yesterday and another 2.5 lakh litres today. We will get a trend in the next two days,” he said.

Meeting with Talasani

Representatives of the dairy industry conferred at a meeting chaired by Animal Husbandry Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav on Saturday where the prevailing situation was discussed threadbare.

The meeting had resolved to ensure that there should not be any price rise now and the industry had been strictly advised against increasing the MRP. It was also decided to form vigilance teams with officials at different levels to monitor the situation and keep a watch on the price situation.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/dairy-industry-in-telangana-facing-a-piquant-situation/article31195274.ece
213,2020/03/28,Transport travails for paramedics,"Hospital superintendents seek police help for arranging vehicles but to no avail

The government has mandated that the entire staff of its hospital network be available for duty in full strength despite the lockdown, but for para-medical staff, who do not have a vehicle of their own, it has been a rough ride.

With buses, cabs and autorickshaws off the roads, nurses, ward boys, aayaahs, X-ray and lab staff, pharmacists and drivers struggle to reach hospitals and return home. Adding to their woes, the police have laid down a norm that no cab can ply with more than four persons, including the driver, if at all the staff choose to hire these vehicles and carry permission letters from superintendents of the hospitals where they are employed.

The superintendents also addressed separate letters to the police to arrange vehicles for the para-medical staff, but to no avail. The police’s argument is that they are unable to make such arrangements for even women constables who did not have vehicles.

Warning against truancy

Sources said hospital authorities have issued stern warning to the staff that they will be referred to the Commissionerate of Vaidya Vidhana Parishad or Directorate of Medical Education if they do not report for duty. In such a scenario, the paramedics are forced to pay up to ₹500 to ₹1,000 to work and back every day.

On the other hand, private nursing homes and hospitals are operating with skeletal staff strength after closing down routine out-patient services and elective surgeries.

Only emergencies are being attended with doctors on call who have no transportation issues since they have cars and do not come across any police obstacles as such.

Telangana Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association secretary Mohan Gupta said the private institutions do not require staff in such circumstances. Their ambulances are used to provide transportation to the para-medical staff.

All clinics and several small and medium nursing homes and hospitals have closed gates and declared holiday for staff.

The reasons attributed to the closure are to not risk admitting coronavirus suspects and the possibility of their attendants coming and going out which could add to the problem.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/transport-travails-for-paramedics/article31195095.ece
214,2020/03/28,"First coronavirus casualty in Telangana reported, eight new cases","No red zones in and around Hyderabad, says Eatala Rajender

The first death of a person who tested positive for coronavirus was recorded in Telangana on Saturday. A 74-year-old man with travel history to New Delhi died at a corporate hospital in Hyderabad. Samples collected from him tested positive for the virus. His family members too would be screened to know if they contracted the infection.

Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender said the 74-year-old man had visited a masjid in Delhi. He had a history of a pneumonia. He got admitted to a corporate hospital for treatment, not as a COVID-19 patient, and died there.

“As he had travel history to New Delhi and had the symptoms, we had collected the samples which tested positive for coronavirus,” Mr Rajender said.

Six of a family affected

Meanwhile, eight new COVID-19 cases were detected in the State, taking the total number to 67, including the 74-year-old man. Other fresh positive cases include six members of a family in the old city. Four of another family in Quthbullapur and four Central government and State government employees who used to screen passengers at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport also contracted the virus. The virus spread to their family members too.

Mr Rajender expressed displeasure over air passengers who had taken paracetamol to suppress fever and evade detection of high body temperature during the thermal screening.

Ten persons tested negative after they were isolated and provided with symptomatic treatment. They should test negative in the second consecutive test before they are discharged. One person, the index (first) case from the State, was discharged a few weeks ago.

As on Saturday, around 13,000 people were in quarantine.

Referring to wide-spread messages about red zones in and around Hyderabad, Mr Rajender said that there were no such red zones.

On detection of a positive case in a locality, Health department teams would take up active surveillance in certain radius of the patient’s home. Depending on the radius which varies from urban to rural locality, the places are marked ‘containment zones’ and ‘buffer zones’.

The teams go door to door to find if any one is suffering from fever, cough, cold or other symptoms. However, photos of banners stating a particular place as ‘red zone’ were circulated on WhatsApp and Twitter. The Health Minister said orders were issued to remove the boards or banners.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/first-coronavirus-casualty-in-telangana-reported-eight-new-cases/article31194877.ece
215,2020/03/28,Medical stocks down,"Distributors depend on courier service as well as transport service for getting supplies

A disruption in the supply chain saw most medical stores running low on stocks in Hyderabad. “Regular supply has nearly stopped. Even emergency indent which used to be received in under 24 hours is now taking two or three days,” said Balraju, a pharmacist at MedPlus medical store in the city. Outside the shop are two announcements, ‘Please come one by one’ and ‘Sanitiser, mask not available’. MedPlus is part of a franchisee chain but the disruption has hit even the smaller standalone stores.

“You cannot have a lockdown and expect medical supplies to flow normally. We depend on courier service as well as transport service for getting medical supplies from places like Allahabad, Delhi, Mumbai, Rajkot etc. All the vehicles are off the road now. All of them don’t have the essential supplies label,” says Subodh Kanodia, one of the bigger pharmaceutical suppliers in the city. “Unless the government moves quickly and uses cargo planes or creates an alternative supply channel we will run out stocks for even essential medicines like insulin, beta-blockers (used for managing blood pressure) and even antibiotics,” says Mr. Kanodia.

“We are getting only 10% of our supplies. People are buying drugs in large quantities,” says Arun, who runs a standalone medical retail store looking at near empty shelves.

“The disruption is a temporary one due to local logistic issues. The State borders are open and it should not be a problem after a few days. Yes, medical stores are insisting on prescriptions for drugs like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin after people started buying them up,” says Mohan Krishna who works in a pharmaceutical company.

The Telangana government is clear about flow of medical supplies. The GO 45 issued on March 22 exempts medical supplies as well as manufacture from lockdown: “Hospitals, optical stores, diagnostic centres, pharmaceuticals manufacturing and their transportation,” and “However, production and manufacturing units which require continuous process such as pharmaceuticals, API etc. may function.” But the supply chain across the country has been disrupted leaving its impact on Hyderabad and Telangana medical supplies.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/8juinj/article31194867.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29MEDIAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/medical-stocks-down/article31194868.ece
216,2020/03/28,Fever Hospital renovated,"COVID-19 patient temporarily shifted to under-repairs ward, explains doctor

A few days after a woman COVID-19 patient uploaded a video of abysmal condition in a ward at Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Communicable Diseases, renovation works were completed. In the video, the patient complained of poor condition in the ward, bathrooms, and presence of mosquitoes. She also complained that doctors did not attend them regularly.

She was admitted in Ward-7 on March 23, and samples collected from her tested positive for coronavirus. The results were received on March 24 night. The hospital’s authorities said that only suspects are admitted there and positive patients are shifted to either Gandhi Hospital or Government General and Chest Hospital.

When they wanted to shift her to the Chest Hospital, the authorities were informed that there were no beds and to shift the patient next morning. Since other suspects in the ward-7 objected to her stay in the same ward, she was shifted to Ward-8 which was under renovation. She was shifted from there to Chest Hospital on March 25 morning.

“The renovation works are completed in the ward, bathrooms are completed. Mosquito nets were fitted to windows,” Superintendent of the Fever Hospital K Shankar said.

218,2020/03/28,Maintain social distance: Minister,"Gangula Kamalakar inspects temporary vegetable market at the RTC bus stand

In order to check the spread of coronavirus in Karimnagar town, the district authorities have shifted the existing main vegetable market from the Tower circle area to the sprawling RTC bus station complex in the heart of the town.

Besides, the authorities had also increased the number of vegetable markets from the existing five to the 11 markets in the town for the benefit of the people to purchase the vegetables from the nearest location and avoid crowding at main market area and help people to maintain social distancing while purchasing the vegetables and avoid the spread of the virus.

Minister for BC Welfare and Civil Supplies Gangula Kamalakar visited the RTC bus station complex to inspect the newly set up temporary vegetable market on Saturday along with Mayor Y Sunil Rao, Municipal Commissioner Valluru Kranthi and others. The Minister inspected the markings for social distancing in front of each vegetable stall and interacted with the customers.

Speaking on this occasion, the Minister appealed to the people to maintain social distancing while purchasing vegetable and groceries at all shops to avoid the spread of virus. He said that the Karimnagar district would be rid of the COVID-19 virus if the people follow the social distance and remaining indoors for another 15 days. He urged the people not to move in groups and chit-chat in groups as there was every possibility of spread of virus.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/h73jej/article31194376.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29KRN-MINISTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/maintain-social-distance-minister/article31194377.ece
219,2020/03/28,Dearth of liquor makes many happy at home,"A number of addicts turn up at hospital with withdrawal symptoms, says doctor

Is suspension of liquor sale, owing to the lockdown, a loss of income for government or saving of precious money for the common man? The answer, of course, depends on which side of the fence you are but, women in general are a happy lot not only because of the saving but because it has brought peace in many a home.

“Yes, I am quite happy that his drunken tantrums have stopped, even if it is temporary,” observed the wife of an addicted government teacher. “There are many like me who have welcomed the development,” she added.

The 21-day lockdown would save about ₹ 100 crore in sale value of liquor for people across former united Adilabad district as the monthly sale is pegged around ₹ 135 crore mark. Drinkers will consume at least 23 lakh litres of liquor less this excise year, that is if the lockdown is not extended further.

Tipplers in fact constitute one of the sections which has been hard hit by the measures being taken to contain COVID-19. The sudden closure of shops on the day of Janata Curfew, which was followed up with the lockdown, caught them off guard and hardly anyone could make ‘arrangements’ for the ‘difficult’ days ahead.

Even the operators of the numerous belt shops, the illegal liquor vends scattered in rural areas as well as slums in towns, failed to ‘stock’ liquor. “They would have made a killing in the 21 days,” pointed out the owner of a retail liquor outlet from where most of the belt shop operators sourced their liquor.

The number of alcoholics is more in the working class who drink cheap liquor usually in belt shops. Doctors are warning that this segment of alcoholics could face health issues if the dry days are extended.

“Yes, a few out patients complaining of symptoms typical of the withdrawal faced by addicts are coming to the hospital everyday,” divulged doctor M. Dattu of the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Adilabad. “Among such patients, more severe issues are faced by those who are addicted to toddy adulterated with diazepam and alprazolam drugs,” he pointed out.

About 20 addicts of spurious toddy had died in 2015 in the eastern parts of Nirmal district after the drink was in short supply due to a crackdown by the Excise department on vends selling the adulterated type then. It could have become worse had the government continued with curbing the illicit toddy that year.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ymkrk6/article31194305.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29LIQUOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/dearth-of-liquor-makes-many-happy-at-home/article31194306.ece
220,2020/03/28,Villages strictly follow lock down,"Villagers ensure availability of goods and essentials

One can see about two kilometres either side of the road at this remote village located between Nyalakal and Zaheerabad.

“No one is allowed into the village due to coronavirus. Please do not enter our village,” was written on a white paper and hung from the check post at the entrance of the village. The check post was located about one kilometre from the village. Dry bushes were spread on the road to prevent anyone from entering the village. However there was no one at the spot.

At another village, Bellapur, some 10 persons were sitting on roadside under a chapta shade. They were seen discussing everything under the sky from corona, its impact, how people are suffering and what will be the fate of people who are daily wage earners. The village has a population of about 5,000 and all of them are dependent on agriculture activity. Though few used to work at other places they have also returned.

“Our village has seven entries all connected to the main road that passes through the village. Hence we have blocked all the roads except this one adjacent to the chapta. Some or other resident will be here to monitor entry of others into the village,” village sarpanch A. Rajasekhar Reddy said. The goods are being brought to the village from Naryanakhed by sending autos to the nearby places and police are allowing the essential commodities.

Though milk used to come from the neighbouring Karnataka, now it was stopped and they are dependent on supplies from Hyderabad.

The Nalgonda district administration on Saturday sent seven persons to the quarantine centre set up at Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU), after they were found violating their prescribed home-quarantine norm.

All of them who were workers from outside Telangana had returned here recently and were advised home quarantine. However, when officials checked on them on Saturday, they were found violating the order.

District Collector Prashant Patil said such violators are punishable under law, and presently they were kept under doctor’s monitoring at the closed centre at MGU.

Also, the same quarantine rule will be strictly applicable for all foreign returnees, in the interest of public safety. And a day-to-day monitoring is being imposed on them by a team of police and medical officials, he said.

Reiterating the assurance of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao that procurement of farmer’s rabi produce will be at the doorstep, as per minimum support price and purchased till the last grain, Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy on Saturday directed officials to make necessary arrangements.

“All the 563 revenue villages in Nalgonda will have procurement centres, and they will be operated by primary agriculture cooperative societies and Indira Kranthi Patham centres,” he said.

An estimated six lakh metric tonne paddy would be purchased in the district, and mandals such as Nalgonda, Miryalaguda, Nagarjunasagar, PA Pally and Mallepally, which produce higher yields should have multiple centres and procurement strategy, he told officials.

Addressing a review meeting with District Collector Prashant Patil, Superintendent of Police A.V. Ranganath and all heads of departments here, Mr. Reddy directed them to take all preventive measures to help curb spread of the virus during the procurement process.

Every centre should have sanitiser and hand wash facility, drinking water and a tent for farmers, and sufficient tarpaulin covers, weighing scales, moisture meters, gunny bags should be arranged.

Mr. Reddy instructed officials to identify specific procurement area in all villages, where social-distance measures can be followed. And purchase arrangements are to be done at the nearest point, such as village entrances, in case the access to large trucks is not possible, he said.

Urging rice millers and lorry associations to step up for the exercise in this difficult time, he requested them to follow a token system approved by local police, to run the driver and hamali worker system smoothly.

Mr. Reddy urged the Police not to obstruct farmers from attending their daily agriculture work.

Later in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district, he held a review with District Collector Anita Ramachandran and other senior leaders and officials.

An estimated 3.55 lakh metric tonne paddy would be brought to procurement centres from 1,08,895 farmers, officials said. A total of 277 procurement centres will be operated, and the minimum support price for a quintal of grade A paddy will be ₹ 1835 and ₹ 1815 for the common grade variety.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/rabi-procurement-at-doorstep-assures-jagadish-reddy/article31194077.ece
225,2020/03/28,Singareni workers pledge one day’s salary to CMRF,"CPI wants lockdown in UG mines; coal production only to meet power plants’ needs

The workers, employees and officers of the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) have decided to donate their day’s salary totalling to ₹8.5 crore to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund (CMRF) as their contribution to the measures being taken by the State government against the spread of coronavirus.

According to the company officials, about 2,400 officers and other employees have pledged their day’s salary, including basic and dearness allowance, amounting to nearly ₹ 1 crore and about 47,000 workers offered their day’s basic and dearness allowance totalling to ₹7.5 crore to the CMRF.

Complimenting the employees’ humane gesture, Chairman and Managing Director of SCCL N. Sridhar stated that the government had listed coal production and despatches as an essential service as the fossil fuel is the main raw material for power generation in several power stations in southern States. Accordingly, the workers were engaged in coal production in three shifts by taking all necessary safety precautions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Besides, the company management was also taking measures to prevent spread of infectious disease in all its mines, workers’ colonies and hospitals.

CPI plea

Meanwhile, the Communist Party of India (CPI) has requested the State government to announce lockdown in the underground mines of Singareni to prevent the spread of coronavirus. In a letter addressed to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Saturday, CPI State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy said the State government responded seriously and positively to prevent the spread of the diseases by implementing lockdown in most of the government departments except those engaged in essential services.

Stating that underground mines would have poor ventilation and the workers would be required to engage in work closely, the CPI leader said the workers said a large number of works would use man-riding lifts and transport vehicles and any infectious worker unaware of his infection could transmit the disease to his co-workers as they work in closed atmosphere. Every mine would have 500 to 1,500 workers besides supervisors and others.

Since coal requirement by other industries has come down, the production could be purely used for power generation by engaging only 10% of its workforce at a time, on turn basis, he suggested. Singareni has a total of 27 underground mines out of its 45 functional mines.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/singareni-workers-pledge-one-days-salary-to-cmrf/article31193947.ece

Panchayat Raj Minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao has assured the farmers that the State government would buy all their produce and asked them not to get panicky.

He said due to lockdown to fight coronavirus pandemic the agricultural markets were closed down. Now the procurement centres would be opened in respective villages and farmers should make use of them without any worry. The payment would be made then and there through cheque. The farmers could also sell their produce to private traders as well who were warned by the State government to pay minimum support price.

Mr. Dayakar Rao and Tribal Welfare Minister Satyavathi Rathod spoke to the zilla parishads chairpersons and MLAs of erstwhile Warangal district and asked them to coordinate the efforts to procure agriculture produce and also in fight against the coronavirus.

The ministers also spoke to the district officials and urged them to ensure uninterrupted supply of groceries, vegetables, milk and other essential commodities to the people.

227,2020/03/28,Drones help Karimnagar police effectively enforce lockdown,"Aerial view helps police observe activity in every nook and corner of the town

The Karimnagar Commissionerate of Police, who set a trend by using the drones for the first time in the district to check the consumption of liquor from October 2017, had used drones to check illegal sand mining, night patrolling, surveillance of rallies and meetings, among others.

Now, the drones have come in handy for the effective implementation of the lockdown and enforce curfew in all lanes and bylanes in various parts of the town.

The drones have come handy especially in the surveillance of the ‘Red Zone’ covering three municipal divisions in the town to check any intrusion by any new person into the zone or persons from the zone breaking the security cordon and going out. Mukarampura and Kashmirgadda areas in the town were demarcated Red Zone as a group of 10 Indonesian preachers, who tested COVID-19 positive, had stayed there and closely interacted with the residents of the locality. Further, a resident of the town who had played host to the visitors and moved closely with them had also tested positive for the coronavirus.

The district administration had notified the area as Red Zone and barricaded all the roads around it and deployed police forces to enforce the isolation of the residents. However, the residents of the are were violating the police restrictions and assembling in groups in various localities in the lanes and bylanes. The police, who were posted at the barricades, were unable to notice what’s happening inside the localities.

To improve the effective monitoring of the movement of residents and enforce the lockdown that was imposed to break the spread of the coronavirus, the police deployed drone cameras for surveillance in entire town.

Talking to The Hindu on Saturday, Commissioner of Police VB Kamalasan Reddy said that they were using drones because they could not man lanes and bylanes to maintain close surveillance. “With the drone camera surveillance, we are covering each and every corner of the town and noticing the violations of lockdown and taking action accordingly,” he stated.

“We have three drone cameras and deployed them for the surveillance in the morning and night times also for effective implementation of lockdown and curfew,” he added.

“Our aim is only to help break the chain of spread of the coronavirus by enforcing the lockdown and curfew in Karimnagar town and see that the people are safe,” the Police Commissioner added.

The police had formed ‘Drone patrolling team’, which are working round-the-clock for effective implementation of lockdown during the daytime and curfew in the night. The drone patrolling team after noticing a group of people in various lanes and bylanes were alerting the concerned police, who were rushing to the spot and dispersing the mob, if required seizing their vehicles and sensitising them on the importance of isolation.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/rxjf4z/article31193878.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29KRNDRONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/drones-help-karimnagar-police-effectively-enforce-lockdown/article31193879.ece

Municipal Administration and Urban Development Principal Secretary has instructed officials to ensure that there are no shortcoming in the maintenance of hygiene and sanitation in all urban areas.

Addressing a teleconference with the municipal commissioners along with Commissioner Municipal Administration N. Satyanaranana here on Saturday, Mr. Arvind Kumar said that available funds should be used for sanitation while creating awareness among people in urban areas.

He said with the help of local police officers, proactive measures should be taken to prevent shortage of essential commodities. Social distancing norms be enforced in front of shops selling grocery, vegetables and other essential goods, petrol bunks and other areas and suitable arrangements be made in coordination with the shopkeepers.

He said that care should be taken to see that there will not be dearth of essential commodities to poor and daily wagers and every day sanitation drive should be held near Annapurna canteens and social distancing norms be implemented.

Mr. Arvind Kumar said that ₹ 181.5 crore under the land regularisation scheme due to 36 municipal corporations and municipalities in five districts of Rangareddy, Medchal, Malkajgiri, Sangareddy, Yadadri and Medak under HMDA were released as per the instructions of Chief Minister.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ensure-no-shortcomings-in-hygiene-and-sanitation/article31193751.ece

Vegetable supply in Adilabad town was hit on Saturday as the vegetable commission agents closed shops alleging lack of proper facilities to do business at the Ramlila maidan. The district administration had shifted the old main vegetable market from the highly congested Shivaji chowk to the expansive Ramlila maidan ground near rythu bazar two days back.

“The authorities are not allowing our workers and clerks to reach Ramlila maidan which is making work quite difficult in the new place. We are being told to wind up our daily business quickly which is also not possible,” pointed out Syed Ayub, a representative of the vegetable commission agents.

There was also the issue of earmarking of space for individual vegetable seller. The area being open to air ground all concerned were worried about the summer heat in the afternoons.

The issue was thrashed out later and the authorities not only marked space for individual vegetable sellers but agreed to provide tents.

232,2020/03/28,Union Minister urged to declare holidays to coal mines,"Coal workers cannot maintain social distance in mines, says BMS

The Singareni Coal Mines Karmika Sangh affiliated to Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh has urged Union Minister of Coal and Mines Prahlad Joshi to instruct the Telangana government to announce lockdown for the coal miners of Singareni Collieries Company Limited to help the check the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).

In a memorandum faxed to the Union Minister and a copy of which was released to the media here on Saturday, Singareni Coal Mines Karmika Sangh State president Kengerla Mallaiah complained that the State government in spite of announcing lockdown till April 15 had forced the Singareni coal miners to work in odd working conditions in groups in various mines and extract the coal.

Incidentally, there cannot be social distancing in the coal mining activities and miners were forced to work in groups for the excavation of coal in the underground mines, he said and added that in every shift more than 500 miners work in groups in the mines and there was every possibility of spread of the virus in the mines. Stating that they coal miners cannot prevent spread of virus by wearing masks, washing hands with soap or sanitisers etc, he said that the coal miners and their family members were worried lot over the possible spread of virus following the working during the lockdown period to break the chain of virus.

He appealed to the Union Minister to declare closure of all the mines, including Singareni, to check the spread of virus and force the miners to remain indoors (quarantine). He also urged the Union government to provide ₹ 50 lakhs health insurance coverage to the coal miners of Singareni. He also urged the government to strengthen the Singareni hospitals with adequate staff, equipment and medicines to fight the deadly virus in the coal belt region of Telangana State.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/union-minister-urged-to-declare-holidays-to-coal-mines/article31193486.ece
233,2020/03/28,"Impact of COVID-19: Bane for many, boon for some","It’s a blessing in disguise to two TS discoms in losses

If the huge impact of coronavirus spread on the economy at large, including the loss of wage work to millions of those in the unorganised sector aside, the lockdown measures being implemented by the State government as part of the nation-wide shutdown have come as a blessing in disguise to the two power distribution companies running in losses.

With a major section of commercial establishments such as malls, cinema halls, restaurants and bars, showrooms of all sizes and public transport such as metro rail completely shut, service sectors such as banks, IT and ITES companies curtailing their on-site functioning by allowing as many employees as possible to work from home and many State and Central government offices running with skeletal staff, the demand for energy in the State has been on the slide for over a week now.

“Except the employees whose physical presence is inevitable in the IT and ITES company offices such as networking guys and some operations and maintenance staff the most of managements were allowing work-from-home to as many of their employees as possible to prevent the spread of virus,” G. Siva Darshan, an engineer working for a major IT company, said.

According to the officials of TS-Transco, the consumption of energy which clocked at 256.18 million units (MU) with the peak intra-day load on the system getting recorded as 12,548 MW on March 18, the first day of partial shutdown imposed by the State government, has come down to 202.5 MU on March 26 with the intra-day peak demand down to 10,019 MW. It has slipped further to about 9,850 MW on Friday.

“Consumption of energy by the agriculture sector is intact with the farming operations of the rabi cultivation going on a hectic pace. The demand is down from the commercial category and up from the domestic category with most of the working class forced stay at home,” a senior executive of the power utility explained.

He stated that the demand from the agriculture sector, served by several major and minor lift irrigation projects/schemes and about 24.2 lakh farm pump-set connections, would remain high with the standing crops being in the crucial phases of advanced vegetative growth, reproductive (panicle/cob/pod formation) and ripening (harvesting). The decrease in demand would mean lesser short-term purchases of power and a proportionate saving to the discoms, he explained.

On the other hand, the lockdown is boon for many retail vendors of groceries, vegetables and needs of daily life with most of them making a fast buck by jacking up prices. “The present situation is a peculiar example of the two sides of a coin,” the power utility official said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/l4j2jg/article31194644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy29powercol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/impact-of-covid-19-bane-for-many-boon-for-some/article31193295.ece
234,2020/03/28,Eight from Raichur killed in lorry-mini truck collision near Hyderabad,"The mini-truck was carrying 31 migrant labourers to their native State Karnataka following lockdown

Eight people, including a three-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl from Karnataka, were killed and three others suffered severe injuries on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) in Shamshabad after a mango-laden lorry rammed the Bolero maxi truck they were travelling late on Friday. The wounded were rushed to Osmania General Hospital in Hyderabad and their condition is said to be critical.

The mini-truck was carrying 31 migrant labourers who were engaged with a road infrastructure firm in Suryapet district of Telangana. The driver, Hanuma Gowda, created a partition with planks to accommodate more people and they started around 6 p.m. All of them were returning to their native place in Raichur and Yadgir districts in Karnataka as the road project they were working on was stalled owing to the nationwide lockdown. Shamshabad police reached the collision site and a crane was used to pull out the bodies from the wreckage.

According to inspector R. Venkatesh, the ill-fated vehicle took the ORR near Abdullapurmet and was proceeding towards Hyderabad-Bengaluru National Highway. When they reached near Pedda Golconda toll gate around 11.30 p.m., the speeding mango-laden truck crashed the maxi truck moving in the same direction. “The 14-ton truck proceeding to Baroda in Gujarat from Nuzividu in Krishna district of AP hit the mini truck from the rear side,” Mr. Venkatesh said.

“Prima facie it appears to be the result of over speeding. The accused lorry driver might have lost control on the wheel due to sudden sloop. The stretch is bumpy,” the inspector said.

The impact of the accident was such that five of them died on the spot, while three others succumbed while undergoing treatment at the hospital. The bodies were shifted to OGH morgue for autopsy.

The victims were identified as Rangappa (27), Sharanappa (25), Amaresh (18), Kolappa (25), Subash Patanshetty (50), Sridevi (08), Basamma (25) and her three-year-old son Hanumantha.

This is the first major road accident that took place after Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao announced a lockdown on Monday.

The State has sealed all inter-State borders and the police are not allowing any person or vehicle to cross. The ghastly accident raises several questions on the functioning of police check-posts in the districts, as the ill-fated vehicle managed to reach the outskirts of the State capital, despite ‘night curfew’ from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m.

A case under Section 304-A (Causing death by negligence) of IPC was registered against the truck driver Dileep, who fled from the spot. Meanwhile, Suryapet police booked DRMS Road Engineering Company under Section 304-II (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of IPC for allowing their workers to travel during the lockdown period.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/12128v/article31191269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/raichur,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/many-from-raichur-killed-in-lorry-mini-truck-collision-near-hyderabad/article31189595.ece
235,2020/03/28,COVID-19: Cartoonists vs fake news during the Coronavirus lockdown,"Tired of telling your family that garlic is more likely to keep the neighbours away than deter the virus? Here's some help from an unexpected quarter — cartoonists take on fake news

As India comes to a standstill due to the Coronavirus pandemic, cartoonists are swinging into action, to reach out to people and raise awareness about the virus, in an approachable, fun way.

“Unverified WhatsApp forwards are spreading fast, probably faster than the corona virus itself,” says Sameera Maruvada, a Visakhapatnam-based cartoonist. Sameera has taken it upon herself to bust myths about the virus and social distancing through her cartoons. One of them, posted on her handle @saltandsambar, mocks the 'miraculous' home remedies constantly being forwarded by well-meaning friends and family.

Sameera Maruvada’s cartoon mocking the reality of self-isolation

“There is so much fake news circulating on social media creating unnecessary panic. So as a person who has the privilege of reaching hundreds of people, I want to do my bit to help people understand the situation better,” she adds.

Not all cartoons are educational though; some are made just to capture the surreal situation. “I created a cartoon of a girl with a broom and captioned it ‘I thought quarantine was all about Netflix and chill’ and that got the most number of responses, as many thought it was hilariously relatable,” she adds.

Myths and mythology at the time of social distancing

For Kochi-based stand-up comic Sabareesh Narayanan and graphic designer Anna Jovitha from Alappuzha, the surgical mask is ""a symbol"" of the current times. When the duo from Kerala decided to collaborate on a series of cartoons to highlight the importance of adopting precautionary measures and also reflect the prevalent mood, they looked to mythology.

In one of the panels, in their 'Ramayana in the time of Corona' series, Lakshmana is seen ""social distancing"" from his brother, Rama, ensuring a ""safe distance"" using a measuring tape. Another one shows ten-headed Ravana with masks on all his heads, struggling to fasten them all together. Meanwhile, Hanuman stands by a window with a bottle of hand sanitiser, wearing a mask, presumably upset at being unable to venture out.

""The idea was to try and put a smile on people's face in these difficult times,"" says Sabareesh, who conceptualised the cartoons. Anna says once Sabareesh conveyed the ideas to her, she wanted the cartoons to have a ""catchy visual language"", making them look like pop culture. ""The works were done digitally. If you notice, there's no elaborate details, especially for the backgrounds. I was more interested in depicting the characters as cute,"" she says.

Stay at home say some cartoons

Hyderabad-based cartoonist Shankar Pamarthy’s Coronavirus cartoons not only draw attention on its impact on the world but advocates a stay at home message to stop its spread. In his cartoons, the virus in green appears circular in shape and wrapped with spikes. One cartoon shows a man riding a scooter unaware that the virus is his pillion rider. Happy that the man has come out of his house, the virus gleefully remarks, “Hamayya bayitiki ravemo ani bhayapadi chachha (I was scared, you will not come out). One image depicts Hercules bearing the virus instead of the globe, the other portrays how eager the virus is to shake hands with a man, who prefers a namaste.

“My focus is to send the message loud and clear asking everyone to stay at home,” says Shankar, who uploads his cartoons on social media from home, where he is enjoying spending time with his two sons. “Even after strict instructions by the government to stay indoors, we still see some people out on the roads. Unless it is an emergency, we should stay indoors and help in containing the virus’ spread and break the chain.”

From a safe distance

Sabari Venu’s Mean Curry, a comic strip on insta with a following of more than 17.5 K , uses a mix of Malayalam and English to come up with sharp but humour-laced observations on current affairs and society.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, his followers were keenly waiting to see what the Bengaluru-based designer would come up with: he opened with a cheeky panel on his facebook page, Mean Curry on March 20's Janata curfew and banging of vessels.

On March 24, he put up another one that showed a dad barely coping with four children: one kid draws a pic on his white dhoti, while he combing the hair of the second child. Meanwhile he balances the third and fourth on his shoulder and arm. Sabari posts that the cartoon is for all “super parents self isolating with their little hyper-active monsters”.

He says, “The drawing is a part of a colouring book created by Nithin Mathew and Sanid Asid Ali.for exhausted parents looking for ways to distract their kids,” adding that this initiative, which features drawings by different artists on Instagram, will be distributed for free.

236,2020/03/28,"Museums, home delivered","As the country locks down, people are turning to online forums of history and art

When young cultural practitioner Medhavi Gandhi developed Scavenger Hunt, a game in which you look for particular objects in Hyderabad’s Salar Jung Museum using the Google Arts & Culture virtual tour, it did not get a particularly enthusiastic response. Then, last week, the numbers jumped. When Gandhi saw the sudden spike in the number of hits to 380, she re-shared it, and the numbers rose even more.

As the coronavirus forces us to stay indoors, young people, students, and families are turning to creative activities online. And museums and art platforms have begun to see this as an excellent opportunity to connect. So you can download a Jamini Roy activity sheet for children, or stencils of folk paintings, or look for objects in your family archive and write about it, or just browse through stories.

Paul Abraham’s Sarmaya is a digital museum that offers lectures, virtual exhibitions, and reading on the traditions of Indian art. But Abraham, a banker, realised it was time to push the envelope. “We realised that parents wanted their kids to learn, play and stay entertained at home. So earlier this month we shared stencils of our favourite objects from folk and indigenous art collections that could be downloaded, coloured and shared ,” says Avehi Menon, Archive Director, Sarmaya Arts Foundation.

Spanish flu

To commemorate the centenary year of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the Partition Museum in Amritsar had put together an exhibition last year. Their research found a lot of material related to the Spanish influenza that had infected millions in 1918. When its physical doors were shut, the museum decided to relate these stories online. An old newspaper clipping for instance reads “Calcutta is now suffering from a mysterious disease, the cause of which have (sic) so far baffled medical practitioner (sic) here, though various theories are advanced as to its origin.”

“We have been running a lot of interactive activities on our social media pages,” says Mallika Ahluwalia, the CEO of Partition Museum. “Earlier this week we asked people to look around their homes for items from their family archives they could post and tag us on. We are also creating worksheets around textiles and other subjects families can do together. And we will be posting written testimonies around the subject of Spanish influenza.”

Gandhi meanwhile is putting out crossword challenges and quizzes on the The Heritage Lab website she founded, and on social media. A Jamini Roy activity sheet had more than 850 downloads in just one week. “My target audience is the millennials and I am getting a lot of feedback from them. Even educators can use these tools. The possibilities are far greater than what museums are exploring right now,” she says.

History and humour

The Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Mumbai City Museum in Mumbai was perhaps the first museum in the city to partner with Google Arts and Culture in 2016. The virtual tour has been accessed by about 51 million people worldwide. According to Ruta Waghmare-Baptista, Assistant Curator-Education and Collection at the museum, “We now have over 250 objects from the permanent collection, new acquisitions, and seven virtual exhibitions for people to explore. On our social media pages, we combined humour and history to talk about best practices as prescribed by WHO during these times.”

The viewership has doubled this week, says Waghmare-Baptista. “It is indicative of how important online engagement is for museums, especially during times like these when all of us could use some positivity, art, and humour.” The National Museum in Delhi is unveiling its latest exhibition ‘The Great Steppe: Time. Space. Culture’ on its Instagram page. Hashtags like #museumsfromhome #museumgames created by museums in the U.S. after they shut down are being used by several Indian museums as well,” explains Gandhi, who is developing a digital tool kit for museum professionals in India and Europe.

Dining with laptops

Jehangir Nicholson Art Foundation on Mumbai is also reaching out to people in innovative ways. “We recently initiated an interactive activity on Instagram, ‘What’s on your lunch table?’, where we asked people to doodle on a line drawing of a table, which we took from an F.N. Souza painting from our collection. We had a great response to this post as people got creative, drawing the things on their tables,” says Puja Vaish, Director of the Foundation.

Many people drew food, some sketched laptops and work materials and hand sanitisers, as the dining table was now doubling up as a work table. While this was a fun activity, it also highlighted the work by Souza in the collection. And it also gave people an outlet to share their stories during these strange times,” says Vaish.

238,2020/03/28,Nitish upset with States sending back migrants,"‘Ferrying them in buses will defeat the very purpose of lockdown’

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday disapproved of some States sending back scores of migrant workers to Bihar in buses.

“The very purpose of the lockdown will be defeated if thousands of migrants are sent to Bihar by buses. My government has already asked the Bihar Resident Commissioner in New Delhi to coordinate with various State governments and reimburse the costs of their food and stay,” he told a news channel.

The U.P. and Delhi governments have arranged hundreds of buses for migrant workers to go home.

“COVID-19 will spread if they are ferried together in buses,” Mr. Kumar said. “It is better to organise camps locally. The State government will reimburse the costs of these camps,” the Chief Minister said.

Mr. Kumar recently announced that ₹100 crore would be released from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund for the food and shelter of Bihar workers stranded in other States. Several MLAs and MPs have announced donations to the State government to deal with the situation.

The Bihar government on Friday created a Corona Eradication Fund and said the planning and development department would deduct a minimum of ₹50 lakh from the funds under the MLA and MLC Local Area Development Scheme. The health department would open a separate bank account for the CEF, and the amount would be utilised for buying medicines, masks, kits and other equipment, a senior official told The Hindu.

Migrants from Delhi, Jaipur, Gurugram, Noida and other places have been reaching different parts of Bihar with their families and friends, walking hundreds of miles, with very little food, their faces covered with masks. “Many of them are still on their way and are held up at different places... We set off early so we reached here after four days from Jamuna Vihar in Delhi where we worked as daily wagers... We walked 1,000 km, some time on an empty stomach,” Bhai Permanand and his three friends said at Patna Bypass Road. They are returning to their villages in Supaul and Saharsha. They were speaking to a news channel on Friday night.

Bihar has so far reported 10 positive cases, with one death. The victim had travelled from Qatar and had a kidney ailment. His wife and nephew were also found infected. The compounder of the private hospital where he had been admitted first was also found infected with the novel coronavirus.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nitish-upset-with-states-sending-back-migrants/article31195426.ece
239,2020/03/28,Manipur MLA Shyamkumar disqualified,"He joined BJP after winning 2017 election on Congress ticket

Manipur Speaker Yumnam Khemchand on Saturday disqualified Thounaojam Shyamkumar as a member of the Assembly for defection.

Shyamkumar was elected to the Assembly as a Congress candidate on March 12, 2017, from 7-Andro constituency. The Congress had won 28 seats and the BJP 21. However, the BJP allied with the National People’s Party to form a government.

Before he was sworn in as an MLA, Mr. Shyamkumar joined the BJP and became the Minister for Forest and Environment in the government led by N. Biren Singh on March 16, 2017. He was sworn in as a member of the Assembly on March 19.

15 Congress MLAs filed petitions for Mr. Shyamkumar’s disqualification, arguing that he had violated the 10th Schedule of the Constitution. The 10th Schedule lays down the process by which legislators may be disqualified for defection by the Speaker on a petition by any other member of the House. As the petitioners were not happy with the inordinate delay in the disposal of the case, they moved the Manipur High Court and the Supreme Court.

On January 21 this year, the Supreme Court had set a deadline of four weeks for the Speaker to dispose of the case. As the Speaker did not comply with its order, the court on March 18 ruled that Shyamkumar had “ceased” to be a Minister and he could not enter the Assembly complex.

Mr. Shyamkumar argued that the 10th Schedule could not be invoked in his case as he became an MLA only on March 19, 2017. The Speaker’s tribunal brushed aside this plea, citing several court rulings.

On Thursday last, Mr. Shyamkumar submitted an official letter to the Speaker’s tribunal, expressing his “willingness” to resign from the Assembly.

The development is bound to have a political fallout since several MLAs of the BJP and its allies have been demanding a Cabinet shuffle.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/manipur-mla-shyamkumar-disqualified/article31194383.ece

The first instalment of the grant should be given to States based on per person population. Later, the grant amount can be given more to the States where the infection rate is high, and proportionally to the remaining States, the Chief Minister said in his letter to Mr. Modi.

Mr. Gehlot, while extending gratitude to the Prime Minister for announcing an economic package in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, said the Centre and States have to jointly fight this pandemic.

He said the Centre should direct the Reserve Bank of India to provide ₹1 lakh crore to States as an interest-free advance.

This should be done for 11 months from April 1, the Chief Minister said in his letter.

He mentioned that economies of the States have been adversely affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Noting the huge decline in tax and non-tax revenue, he said permission for additional two per cent credit limit should be given immediately from the Net Credit Limit which the States get.

The Chief Minister said States expect that the Centre should grant moratorium of at least three months in the payment of instalments due to the RBI and other financial institutions.

Mr. Gehlot said that people are facing a crisis due to the lockdown.

To save the people from starvation, the Rajasthan government is making all possible efforts to maintain the supply chain of essential items along with a direction to provide cash to the weak and deprived sections of the society, he said.

Cases of COVID-19 have been low in the country’s northeast, but challenges on how to combat the disease are tougher. Speaking to The Hindu, Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the low number of cases currently in the region was no reason to be complacent, and that the State government was taking various measures to build hospital-bed capacity and for Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and ventilators.

“The challenge for us is to build capacity during this lockdown period, for equipment and hospital beds as well as quarantine facilities,” he said. To that end, the biggest step the government has taken is to convert the big government hospital in Guwahati only for COVID-19 and asking all other patients to shift to private hospitals. “We have extended Ayushman Bharat Scheme of cashless coverage to all persons in Assam going to any of the 36 private hospitals in the State. This will immediately relieve the stress on the government hospitals. Also, all hospitals attached to medical colleges in the State, seven in all, will be converted for COVID-19 treatment only,” he said.

An additional 2,500-bed private hospital only for COVID-19 is also in the works.

The State is also engaging engineering firm Larson and Toubro to build five temporary hospitals, each costing ₹40-50 crore, to be up and running in two months. “The life of these hospitals is five years as they will be made from pre-fabricated building material,” he said. The State government has placed orders for ventilators and PPE and is awaiting delivery.

A 700-bed quarantine facility has also been made ready in Guwahati in a local stadium. “We are using the lockdown period to build capacity, as we need to be ready to treat patients if and when numbers go up,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/2sqr8z/article31065719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/nd13-assamGLH7GM9786J304jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/low-number-of-covid-19-cases-in-northeast-no-reason-to-be-complacent-says-assam-minister-himanta-biswa-sarma/article31191658.ece

Walking around the Dighalipukhuri, meaning ‘Long lake’, was a regular morning habit for retired bureaucrat Rajib Prakash Baruah until the 21-day countrywide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic began from March 24 midnight.

He couldn’t quite recall seeing the kharali haanh (lesser whistling duck) wading in the lake when an acquaintance with a better view from the windows of his house reported a flock on Friday.

“We were used to seeing several species of local and migratory waterfowl in Dighalipukhuri when we were young. They have returned after decades possibly because there aren’t any humans around to interfere because of the lockdown,” said Kailash Sarma, a cultural activist who lives beside the Jorpukhuri (Twin lakes), a few metres east of Dighalipukhuri.

“If boating and recreational activities in and around the lake are restricted, the ducks might keep coming,” said Bibhav Talukdar, who heads the green NGO Aaranyak.

He, however, said Guwahati has always had a ‘wild’ side with the city recording some 200 species of mammals. This is because it is woven around 11 forest reserves, several wetlands including a Ramsar site and hills.

Instances of animals venturing out into human habitations have also been reported elsewhere in Assam. A one-horned rhino ambled to Sonapur town, east of Guwahati, from the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, 28 km away. Officials said it was probably because the animal did not face any human obstacles en route.

Meanwhile, a father-son duo was also arrested following a scuffle with the police at a barricade, as police have lodged around 250 FIRs in J&K against “violators of the lockdown”.

In a viral video, the policeman was seen mounted on an armed vehicle and abusing locals on the public address system in a colony. A police spokesman said it was an isolated incident. It has come to the fore that the policeman was posted in north Kashmir’s Sopore.

“The police have take cognizance of the video which was circulated on the social media sites wherein a policeman was allegedly seen making announcement in an abusive manner. He shot the video at an isolated place and was not part of any announcement making team. The policeman has been disengaged immediately and an FIR has been lodged,” a police official said.

The police said an investigation into the matter is in progress.

Father, son booked

In two separate unverified and unconfirmed viral videos, the personnel of the J&K police are seen humiliating locals by forcing them to pose in rooster position and beating up for a driver for “moving without a curfew pass”.

An official said the father-son duo, seen one of the videos, have been booked for violating the administration’s order amid lockdown in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district.

“A vehicle was on the way from Sangrama to Delina when it was stopped at a check point. A team of police on duty asked them to provide curfew passes which they refused. When the concerned police party tried to know the reason behind their journey, they started a brawl with on duty police official. The police official in return responded properly as per the norms and guidelines above the law,” said the police spokesman.

The father is seen beating a policeman in the video after his son is hit with batons by the policeman.

They have been booked under Section 188, 269, 353 of the Indian Penal Code and arrested.

While we welcome swift action against one of the policeman, we demand that all videos must be investigated and appropriate action must be taken against erring policemen,” said a PC spokesman.

The deceased, a Granthi (priest) at a gurdwara in his Pathlawa village, attended ‘Hola Mohalla’ festival in the holy city of Anandpur Sahib between March 8 and 10 and returned to his village. Before being tested positive for the deadly virus, the deceased and his two travel companions reportedly met scores of people and could have widely transmitted the disease.

“Five fresh cases have been reported today [on March 27]. Of the total 38 positive COVID-19 cases, 25 people are family members of the deceased or had come in contact with him. We are making all efforts to trace all those who came in contact with the trio from the time they returned to India. Close to 30 villages have been quarantined in those districts we believe that these people had travelled,” Punjab Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu told The Hindu.

The State Health department said that out of the 5 new cases reported in Punjab on March 27, three patients, who are from Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district are close contacts of a positive case. The other two patients are from Jalandhar and Ludhiana and both are close contacts of a positive case, it added.

Patient cured

Also, the first reported coronavirus patient in Punjab has been cured. The patient, who had returned to Amritsar from Italy, came out to be COVID-19 negative in the latest report after treatment. The male patient was tested positive for the disease earlier this month and was admitted to the Government Medical College and Hospital in Amritsar. “One case admitted in Amritsar has been found negative and is cured,” added the statement.

In Punjab so far, the confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported from six districts, which include 19 from Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, 6 cases each from Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar and Hoshiarpur, 5 from Jalandhar and one each from Amritsar and Ludhiana.

Police cautioned

Meanwhile, taking suo motu notice of alleged police excesses against women during the curfew, Punjab Women Commission Chairperson Manisha Gulati cautioned the police personnel to be more humane and sensitive in dealing with women. She said the manner in which police manhandled women as being shown in various videos was completely unacceptable.

In the Union Territory of Chandigarh one new case of coronavirus was reported on Monday, taking the total of cases to seven in the city.

252,2020/03/28,Rajasthan’s Bhilwara remains a hotbed of coronavirus infection,"The district administration has launched steps on a war-footing to control virus spread which threatens to destroy the local textile industry

With two deaths and 21 COVID-19 positive cases being detected so far, Rajasthan’s Bhilwara town, situated 250 km from Jaipur, continues to remain a hotbed of coronavirus infection. The district administration has launched steps on a war-footing to control the community spread of the virus, which threatens to destroy the local textile industry.

Of the two patients who died, a 73-year-old man was in coma due to kidney failure and had later tested positive for coronavirus. He was admitted from March 3 to 11 in the private hospital where three doctors were later found COVID-19 positive. His samples were obtained when he was in the state of coma.

The administration claimed that his death had occurred because of kidney failure and brain stroke, and not due to COVID-19. Since he was being treated at his home after being discharged from the hospital, his son and granddaughter tested positive on Thursday.

The other deceased — a 60-year-old man — was admitted to the private hospital’s intensive care unit from March 7 to 9 after a heart attack. He visited the hospital again twice and was later shifted to Mahatma Gandhi Government Hospital. He tested COVID-19 positive on March 25 and died the next day.

While the MG Hospital’s doctors attributed his death to dysfunctional kidney and other complications, two of his close relatives tested positive on Friday. They are among the 21 patients who have been confirmed with coronavirus infection after the testing of 439 samples conducted in the town after an intense contact tracing.

Zero mobility area

Bhilwara Collector Rajendra Bhatt said on Friday that while curfew was clamped in the town’s municipal limits on March 20, a one-km radius area around the private hospital, where the infection cases were initially reported, had been declared a zero mobility area as part of the containment zone.

In the biggest screening exercise undertaken in the district, 1,948 teams of health workers have surveyed 4.22 lakh families in both the urban and rural areas and examined 21.64 lakh persons. Hotels, resorts, hostels and dharamshalas have been acquired in the town to arrange 1,500 quarantine beds and 14,400 normal beds to meet an emergency situation.

In his latest action, the District Collector has taken over five private hospitals to ramp up isolation facilities for the coronavirus patients. The State government will provide electricity, water and other necessities during the treatment. At present, 6,445 persons have been home quarantined and 50 persons are in isolation at the government and private medical facilities.

Rajesh Jain, who runs an ear, nose and throat speciality hospital in Bhilwara, said the people in the town wanted to know the source of contagion. “Was the origin in hospital or some other place? The spread has been reasonably controlled because the initial set of patients were all medicos and hospital staff,” he said.

24-hour screening

A 24-hour screening centre had been established in Bhilwara to cover the people with symptoms as well as those who came in contact with the hospital’s staff. Medical and Health Minister Raghu Sharma said the situation was under control and senior officers and health experts were tracking all developments.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rajasthans-bhilwara-remains-a-hotbed-of-coronavirus-infection/article31187976.ece
253,2020/03/28,Lockdown relaxation cancels out distancing norms in Assam,"Hundreds of people throng markets to buy essential items

The Assam government’s experiment with temporary relaxation of the lockdown restrictions backfired on Friday, as hundreds of people thronged the markets to buy essential items.

The government lost no time in issuing a statement banning the operations of most shops after the people threw caution to the wind and made a mockery of physical distancing norms meant to stamp out the COVID-19 pandemic.

Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, now in eastern Assam’s Jorhat, and Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma took note of the huge gatherings shown on news channels. “I never thought people would behave like this during the relaxation on humanitarian grounds. We had insisted on people following the physical-distancing guidelines while buying essential items. People violated them. I am really sad,” Mr. Sonowal said.

Chief Secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna soon issued the statement. “All markets will remain closed until further order, except grocery and pharmacies. Grocery shops will also provide vegetables, fruits, eggs, ginger, garlic and water. DCs [the Deputy Commissioners] will organise distribution of vegetables, etc., through mobile vans in all areas on alternate days. All meat and fish shops will remain closed till March 31. It will be reviewed on April 1. The DCs will fix appropriate time for opening of grocery stores as per local convenience,” it said.

The government directed people to follow the advisories on physical distancing until further orders and warned that violations would attract penal provisions under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.

Pay cut option

Mr. Sarma said the government was weighing the option of deducting a percentage of the pay of its employees and reimbursing it later with interest. “These are ideas we are discussing in case such a situation arises,” he said.

The Health Minister, however, said the employees’ associations had volunteered to donate a day’s pay for expenses to fight COVID-19. “Minus the healthcare sector employees, who are more than compensating with their service, a day’s pay will give us ₹80 crore which, along with other donations, will help us build within two months four of the five prefabricated pandemic-specific hospitals planned,” he said.

Mr. Sarma said the government had signed an agreement with private hospitals for absorbing the patient load from government hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 cases. “All cases, except for cancer, emergency and maternity, will now be handled by the private hospitals until the threat from the pandemic is over,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lockdown-relaxation-cancels-out-distancing-norms-in-assam/article31187906.ece

Terming the coronavirus outbreak as a grave crisis, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar on Friday urged people to follow the government’s directives to contain its spread. During a live interaction with citizens on Facebook, Mr. Pawar also said the package announced by the Central government for agriculture was not enough.

The former Union minister welcomed the Central government’s economic package and the Reserve Bank of India’s decisions to tide over the crisis.

However, he said, “The package for the agriculture sector is not enough. It is impossible to repay the crop loan. Some steps should be taken for the horticulture sector as well.”

By evening, Mr. Pawar had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggesting measures for the agriculture sector. In his letter, he said, “The existing agricultural loans may be restructured and interest subvention, at least 5% per annum, may be offered to banks and other institutions on agri loans.”

The credit requirement, he said, will grow and the government needs to infuse more funds to meet the requirement.

Also, the farm credit target through the National Bank For Agriculture & Rural Development for the current fiscal needs to be increased. “Credit for crop loans should be made available at minimal interest rate.”

He also sought restructuring of existing loans by conversion of short-term loans to term loans, rescheduling the repayment period, alteration of instalment amounts and reduction in interest rates.

While taking questions during his chat, which was arranged by his daughter and Baramati Lok Sabha MP Supriya Sule, Mr. Pawar appealed to people to maintain discipline and also asked the police to exercise restraint and allow movement of vehicles transporting essential services and goods.

“While it is difficult to set up a new hospital for coronavirus patients right now, there are a large number of medical colleges, both private and government, in all the districts in the State. These colleges can be used for treatment as well,” he said, in response to one of the questions.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tyocoq/article31188195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMKARADFARMER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/centres-package-for-agri-sector-not-enough-says-pawar/article31188196.ece
256,2020/03/28,Chaos in Goa as grocery shops reopen after five-day shutdown,"State issues list of pharmacies that will supply medicines

As shops opened in Goa after five days on Friday, there was chaos across the State, with people paying no heed to social distancing.

The State government, which wanted to implement a 100% lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, has only allowed small stores, permitting bigger ones to only provide home delivery from Saturday.

Till Thursday, the government had said all shops would be shut and people would be supplied essentials at their doorstep after working out a system. This, however, was met with opposition from political parties and a section of the public, who accused the government of acting in an unplanned manner.

Inspector General of Police, Goa, Jaspal Singh said citizens should not to take vehicles to grocery shops, as it would hinder formation queues and social distancing. “People should not rush to buy groceries as shops will remain open during the lockdown. Violators of the vehicle advisory will be punished,” Mr. Singh said.

Businessman Dayne Fernandes, who runs two supermarkets in North Goa’s Mapusa, said, “I am hesitant to open the stores as it will put me and my staff at risk. But if my competitors open up, I will be forced to do the same.” He said there was plenty of stock and he would be happy to supply essentials if the government helped on the logistics front.

On Friday, the government also issued a list of pharmacies which will supply medicines to citizens.

After three COVID-19 cases in the State, the government said it is taking multiple steps to tackle the pandemic. Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said five quarantine centres have been set up in North Goa and four in South Goa. “Those who have come from neighbouring States should quarantine themselves,” he said.

Health Minister Viswajit Rane said the government has opened shops, but it was for the people to maintain distancing. “The Health Department plans to get retired doctors on board to tackle this emergency. The government is also taking over two private hospitals as quarantine facilities,” he said.

Virology lab ready

The CM said the government has set up its own virology lab and it will start receiving reports on Saturday. The lab has been set up by the Directorate of Health Services, which sent a team to NIV, Pune for training.

HC disposes of PIL

The government told the High Court of Bombay at Goa that it has allowed grocery shops to open to cater to people’s need. Disposing of a PIL seeking directions to the government to have the police maintain adequate distance among buyers, the HC said the government should explore the possibility of home delivery.

At least seven police personnel, including two policewomen, were injured after being assaulted by a group of youths allegedly found violating home quarantine instructions in Baramati on Friday.

According to sources, around 2 p.m., residents of Jalochi spotted some youths with ‘home quarantine’ stamps on their hands moving about freely. When the villagers tried to tell them they were risking the safety of others, the youths created a ruckus and began assaulting a villager.

A team of the Baramati city police rushed to the spot and tried to force the violators to follow the home quarantine orders.

However, the youths instead attacked the police personnel with rods and sticks, also pelting them with stones.

The police personnel, including senior police inspector Audumbar Patil and another officer, were injured on their hands and legs, while a policewoman received a head injury.

258,2020/03/28,"Can’t stay open 24x7 with police brutality, say chemists","Retail and wholesale associations say shops are working at half the staff strength as staff fear harassment

The government’s guidelines to keep chemist shops open 24x7 will not work if their employees continue to face police harassment and brutality, pharmacy associations have said.

The All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggist (AIOCD) said in a letter that 7,000 chemist shops in Mumbai are already working at half the strength and police harassment will make it difficult to adhere to the guidelines. The association said they have enough stock to tide over the crisis, provided the government takes cognisance of their demands.

“Most of our staff has to arrive across the city from far-flung areas like Vasai and Virar. When the lockdown started, the police took a high-handed approach to treating our men, which led to a feeling of fear among the staff. They have since been holed up inside their homes and we have run the shops with less than half the strength,” said J.S, Shinde, the president of AIOCD, India’s largest umbrella association of medicine shops.

Pharmaceutical wholesalers said at some locations, they were unable to supply stock to retailers owing to manpower shortages at godowns and wholesale warehouses. Maharashtra State Chemist and Drug Association president Hukumraj Mehta said most shops are operational despite the hiccups. “We are willing to pay them overtime, but due to fear of the police during transportation, most of them are not even turning up for duty.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cant-stay-open-24x7-with-police-brutality-say-chemists/article31188152.ece
259,2020/03/28,Maharashtra restaurants can stay open for home delivery,"Shops selling meat, fish, eggs and fruits will also be open

The Maharashtra government on Friday allowed restaurants to re-open kitchens and deliver food to individuals or societies after adhering to prescribed safety norms to protect from the novel coronavirus.

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said the decision has been taken for the benefit of those who are stranded or unable to cook.

The government also announced that shops selling meat, fish, chicken and eggs, and fruits such as mango, grapes, oranges, bananas and watermelon, would be open. “All norms regarding the safety of customers have to be followed. The decision will benefit the farmers who have their produce ready but cannot bring it to the market,” he said.

Fisheries Minister Aslam Sheikh said hundreds of tonnes of fish is lying in boats at Vasai, Uttan, Madh, Varsova, Bhaucha Dhakka and Sassoon Dock due to restrictions on inter- and intra-State movement. “The Central government has now included fish in the list of essential commodities, as a result of which companies exporting fish to foreign countries can collect it directly from ports and local markets too will get the produce,” he said.

On Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das’s announcement regarding EMIs, Mr. Pawar said, “Banks will not listen if the RBI merely suggests to not collect EMIs for three months. A clear direction is required. Considering the nationwide lockdown and its impact on the country’s economy, the RBI should have given instructions instead of suggestions.” Mr. Pawar also holds the Finance portfolio.

Incentive to medical staff

Meanwhile, Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Friday said the State government is considering insurance cover for medical staff treating COVID-19 patients. In a Facebook live event, he said the government also plans to give monetary incentive to the staff. “Medical workers have risked their lives to treat patients,” he said.

Mr. Tope appealed to private doctors, who have stopped their practice due to the pandemic to remain operational. “OPD, emergency medical services have been stopped. This is not right. There are other illnesses apart from COVID-19. Where will people go for deliveries or if someone suffers a heart attack?” he asked.

261,2020/03/28,Coronavirus | 12 more from family in Maharashtra’s Sangli district test positive,"Area where they live in Islampur cordoned off, all family members isolated in Miraj

Maharashtra’s sugar heartland witnessed a sharp spike in the number of COVID-19 cases after 12 more members of a family in Sangli district tested positive for the virus, authorities said on Friday.

Already, 11 members of this family from Sangli’s Islampur tehsil had tested positive, with the first four patients, who had a history of travel to Saudi Arabia, testing positive on March 23. Since then, 19 others — 18 from the same family and a woman from Peth Vadgaon in Kolhapur district who was in touch with this family — have been infected with the virus.

State Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil, who is the MLA from Islampur, said the area where the family lives has been cordoned off and additional measures are being taken to check the spread of infection.

“This [sharp rise in number of cases] is indeed a worrying development. All members of this family are being kept in isolation facilities in Miraj. To prevent the virus from spreading, we have decided that only one person from the family who has not been infected will step out to buy essential items,” Mr. Patil said.

At the same time, he said there was no immediate cause for concern as all patients in the family are stable. “Some members of this family are aged between 62 and 65. However, I have spoken with them and they are fine and are experiencing no respiratory problems,” he said.

With this, Sangli has now recorded 23 cases, while the number of cases in Pune division, including Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Satara and Sangli, stands at 58 — a surge of 16 in the past 24 hours.

The Sangli district authorities have taken action against nearly 1,700 people since the Janata Curfew on March 22 for violating lockdown orders.

With one positive case, the Kolhapur district administration, too, has tightened screws to prohibit assembly. The police have confiscated more than 350 private vehicles and will return them to owners only after April 15, said police inspector Vasant Babar, in-charge of Kolhapur city’s traffic department.

Meanwhile, in a positive development, the first three patients in Pimpri-Chinchwad to have tested positive have been discharged from YCM Hospital after their repeat samples tested negative, Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar said.

262,2020/03/28,"Named, shamed, and living in fear: On Lucknow anti-CAA protests and the accused","In early March, the U.P. police put up several hoardings in Lucknow identifying those accused of violence during anti-CAA protests in December 2019. Omar Rashid reports on the accused who are struggling to fight the stigma of being featured on the hoardings though they have not been convicted

On March 16, the Lucknow administration served a ‘demand notice’ against 20-year-old Osama Siddiqui and 12 others stipulating that they deposit ₹21.76 lakh, plus a 10% collection charge, within a week. If they did not, they faced confiscation of their property or even arrest under the U.P. Revenue Code of 2006. As the family wasn’t home, officials pasted the bill on the door of their house in Khadra locality in old Lucknow.

Yasmin Siddiqui, Osama’s mother, was agitated. Osama was accused of vandalism and arson during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2019 on December 19 in Lucknow. He is out on bail after spending three weeks behind bars. “Without any query, you have made him guilty. Our boy was not involved,” she said. The notice was issued after an Additional District Magistrate Court fixed liability against 13 persons for damaging public and private property in the Hasanganj police station area during the protest. This particular demand notice was in continuation of the series of notices and orders served by the administration on 57 people, including the 13 persons accused of vandalism with a “common object” in the city since late December.

Those listed have been asked to cumulatively pay ₹1.56 crore as fine to the government or risk confiscation of their property. The sum was divided under four police station areas which witnessed violence: Qaiserbagh (₹1.75 lakh), Hasanganj (₹21.76 lakh), Hazratganj (₹64.37 lakh) and Thakurganj (₹67.73 lakh). Even as the accused were trying to recover from the shock of receiving the notice, the administration escalated matters in a dramatic fashion on March 5, when, under the cover of the night, it erected around 100 large roadside hoardings at key parts of the city, showcasing the names, photos and residential addresses of the accused. The hoardings did not mention that they were yet to be convicted of the charge by any court and almost all of them were out on bail. The intention of the U.P. government was clear: Cabinet Minister and government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh tweeted, “Name and Shame of rioters will put a deterrent under Yogi rule”.

Scarred by the episode, Osama, a third-year B.Com student, declined to be interviewed. Yasmin narrated Osama’s experience on December 19. Till 2 p.m., she said, he was spending time with his friends in the lane outside his house, after which he ventured out towards a stationery shop, the family unaware of the violence going on some distance away. He took shelter in a house in the neighbourhood to escape the violence but was caught by the police as they came looking for other members of the mob.

However, the Additional District Magistrate found no merit in Osama’s claim that he had ventured out 2 km from his house when all the shops were shut. On that day, the police were asking the protesters through the public address system to go back to their homes, as prohibitory orders had been enforced. “It’s not possible that a peace-loving person will venture out to purchase stationery near the protest site,” said the recovery order against Osama, one among the many accessed by The Hindu. However, there was no mention in the order of any direct evidence, be it a photograph or a video, of Osama’s involvement in the violence other than his circumstantial presence.

Yasmin was distraught. Not only did Osama miss an examination due to his detention, but after stepping out on bail, he has had to battle the stigma brought by the name-and-shame hoardings. Osama is reluctant to attend college functions these days as he is flooded with curious phone calls and haunted by taunting videos shared by his peers on Tik Tok of the hoardings, Yasmin said.

As the family braces for a legal battle, their immediate concern is the hefty sum demanded. When the case is in court, and Osama is yet to be declared guilty, why should he be asked to pay, Yasmin asked. Her husband doesn’t have a job or business any more. Their main source of income is from the rent they earn from a portion of a refurbished building they once ran as a school. “We won’t be able to pay the fine,” said Yasmin.

Violence in Parivartan Chowk

The Siddiqui family’s ordeal offers a snapshot of the overall situation of the 57 accused. The unusual orders for recovery of damages and name-and-shame hoardings were an extension of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s call for “revenge” against those who vandalised public and private property on December 19.

That day, parts of central Lucknow were engulfed in violence, as the call for protest against the CAA took a nasty turn. Police forces, including the Rapid Action Force personnel, charged at the protesters and fired several rounds of tear gas to push them back into the bylanes from where they threw stones and bricks at the police at intervals. An auto driver died due to a firearm injury. While the protest was scheduled at the centrally located Parivartan Chowk, which was cut off by police through barricades, the riot-control forces appeared to be stretched and struggled to contain the swelling numbers of protesters in other locations.

The charred remains of a motorbike and the damaged railing of the park housing the tomb of Sadaat Ali Khan and his wife at the Parivartan Chowk in Lucknow, which witnessed the worse damage.

At the end of it all, the worst-affected site was Parivartan Chowk, where several motorbikes, three OB vans and a State bus were gutted, as miscreants, many of them with their faces covered with handkerchiefs, threw stones and allegedly set fire to the vehicles parked at the location. The Lucknow administration estimated the overall damages at ₹1.56 crore, of which ₹1.02 crore was for damage to vehicles alone, most of them belonging to the police and other government bodies. All liability was fixed under the principle of joint and several liabilities, meaning the accused would be individually as well as collectively liable for the entire fine amount. The recovery amounts were issued by the concerned Additional District Magistrate after verifying damage claims made by those who suffered the loss.

The extent of damage claimed

In actual terms, the list of vehicles damaged was given as: 25 bikes, four cars, 3 OBV vans, one State bus and the window shields of three buses. The police outpost of Madehganj was targeted and one police vehicle and bikes parked outside the outpost were engulfed in flames. Another car nearby was also damaged.

The list prepared by the administration included items used and owned by the police such as four pairs of fire boots (₹24,000), four helmets (₹10,000), body protector (10 units) worth ₹50,000, four plastic sticks (₹4,000), four fire extinguishers (₹10,000), a dragon torch (₹5,000) and a red blanket (₹4,000). Around 145 metres of street railing worth ₹3.30 lakh was also damaged.

In Qaiserbagh, the police calculated damages worth ₹1.75 lakh: three police barriers (₹24,000), 15 chairs (₹6,000), and two police motorbikes. Most of the damage was done in the Thakurganj area. The Sathkhanda police outpost was torched and vandalised and vehicles outside it set on fire. The cost of the outpost building and three MCRs was ₹24 lakh out of a total of ₹67.73 lakh in Thakurganj. Once again, most of the damage was suffered by the police: a chair worth ₹7,000, a table worth ₹5,000, a camera DVR and camera monitor (51 inch) worth ₹4 lakh, a TV worth ₹3,000, a tubelight worth ₹1,800, three CFL bulbs worth ₹600, a water pump motor worth ₹6,000, a cooler worth ₹5,000, a plastic chair worth ₹4,800, and a bench worth ₹15,000. The police also included a toilet door (₹5,000), two water cooler jars (₹600) and three jars of Bisleri water (₹600) in their claim. Apart from the three OB vans, the media also suffered damage: a photographer’s camera lens worth ₹1.45 lakh along with his Royal Enfield bike, a photographer’s lens and another’s bike were also gutted. The railing, footpath plaster, stone and welding at Parivartan Chowk accounted for ₹10 lakh.

Lack of evidence

As an overwhelming number of the accused (52 out of 57) are Muslims, there is a strong feeling in the community that the U.P. government’s action is disproportionate and discriminatory, and that it is indulging in excesses out of vendetta. The list also has two Ambedkarite Dalit activists, including a retired IPS officer. Many of those arrested in the case reported they faced communal slurs while in custody.

The protests leading up to the December 19 incident were largely taking place without any leaders or banners. But after the violence, the police tried to project certain outfits, most of them linked to Leftists and Muslims, as the alleged brains behind the protests. In Lucknow, the police identified the Popular Front of India, an Islamic outfit, as the “mastermind” of the arson and vandalism and also held culpable the Rihai Manch, a rights groups headed by Mohammad Shoaib, a senior lawyer who helps terror accused fight legal battles and is known for helping a dozen of them get acquitted.

Police try to get a car that was vandalised in the violence back on its wheels near the Madehganj police outpost in the Khadra area of Lucknow.

Shoaib, president of the Manch, was arrested despite being under house arrest during the violence. The exposure on the hoardings has brought a sense of insecurity to those named and shamed, who now fear attacks by vigilante right-wing mobs. Shoaib is used to such threats. In 2008, a mob of lawyers attacked him brutally within the compound of Lucknow court for taking up cases of terror accused.

Over the years, Shoaib has facilitated the acquittal of more than a dozen men implicated in terror cases. Many cases encountered by him involved dealing with dubious FIRs with suspect timings and places of arrests. Little did he know that he would find himself a victim of a similar situation. Shoaib had been placed under house arrest by the police since 5.30 p.m. on December 18 to prevent him from attending the protest at Parivartan Chowk the following day. It was around midnight on November 19 when four cops summoned him, apparently at the call of a local circle officer. Shoaib went along with them, leaving his spectacles, mobile phone and medicine behind, hoping to return home soon. After his wife Malka Bi called the district police chief, two constables came and took the medicine for Shoaib, who was eventually arrested.

The police claimed in the Allahabad High Court that he was arrested at 8:45 a.m. on December 20, from the Clarks Avadh hotel intersection, a charge contradicted by prima facie details.

The police alleged Shoaib indulged in arson, stone pelting and vandalism at Parivartan Chowk and the recovery order against him implicates him for not providing evidence to counter the police charge. Shoaib pointed out that the police has no proof against him — no footage, no photo. “It’s wrong if a recovery is done until someone is proven guilty,” he said.

Ironically, the police submission before the Additional District Magistrate lays bare the lack of clear evidence against Shoaib. The videos and photos of the protester could not be made available because the protesters razed three OB vans that stood between them and the police, said the police. Moreover, whatever photos were clicked were of their assembly prior to the violence and were not clear.

The government’s decision to put up the banners caught the attention of the Allahabad High Court, which, after a rare Sunday sitting, directed the Lucknow administration to forthwith remove them, judging them to be an “unwarranted interference in privacy of people” and in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution. The action reflected the “colourable exercise of power” by the government, the Bench ruled. The Bench directed the Lucknow administration to submit a compliance report by March 16. However, the Yogi Adityanath government failed to comply and instead approached the Supreme Court which, while not granting a stay against the High Court order, sent the matter to a larger bench.

Activists, clerics, labourers

A look at the profiles of the 57 persons named and shamed indicates they are not as privileged as the government argued in court while opposing the suo motu notice. Barring a handful of social activists and clerics, most of those implicated are those struggling to make ends meet. Many are daily wage earners and labourers, with little political or social influence.

Ashma Izzat, a lawyer, who has been fighting legal battles for 25 of the accused, including two minors, said almost all of them are not in a position to pay the fine. Some are unemployed or live in shanties. Waseem Sayyad, a waiter, lives in the premises of the Imambada as he can’t afford rent.

Izzat also argued that the administration did not follow proper procedure in issuing the orders. “They didn’t serve the orders to the accused but put up big hoardings. We applied for certified copies of the order so that we could challenge it and get a stay. So far we have got copies of only three people,” she said.

One of them, Kaleem, is a rickshaw-puller. The other is a Bengali waiter who works in a Mughlai restaurant. Izzat said her clients were scared to come out or open up. “I can’t disclose their location. They are in fear. They feel they could be arrested again,” she said.

The fear and insecurity are palpable even among the rest. Robin Verma, who teaches management at the Shia PG College, was picked up by the police on December 20 from a restaurant outside the BJP headquarters along with this reporter, and added to the list of accused. Ever since the hoardings came up, many of them along his route to work, Robin, who belongs to the OBC Kurmi caste and is the son of a retired Provincial Armed Constabulary personnel, said he stopped using public transport for security reasons. The police had initially issued notices to 95 persons in Lucknow. But 38 were exonerated from the charge of damaging property as police could not produce satisfactory evidence, following which the administration served recovery orders on 57.

Among those implicated was Mohammad Anas, a B. Com student, who claimed he had gone for coaching when police stopped him and challaned him without any proof. Mohammad Tariq, a student, claimed he had gone to fetch medicine for his father when he was nabbed by the police, allegedly at 11:30 a.m., before the protest even began.

The Additional District Magistrate, however, relies on the police claim that they were arrested from the spot and did not produce any evidence to prove their innocence. A similar pattern of fixing culpability follows in several other cases. The case of Kalbe Sibtain Noori, son of prominent Shia cleric Kalbe Sadiq and Maulana Saif Abbas, is peculiar. Noori had submitted that he had visited the Imambada area on the day of the protest to restore calm. But his own admission went against him and he was issued a recovery order for being present on the spot as “a conspirator”. Abbas had claimed that he led a peace march in Muslim areas to calm the situation and appealed for calm on social media. That too didn’t hold in the Additional District Magistrate’s court.

While much outrage was created over the notices for over ₹1.56 crore to 57 persons, in the recovery orders, the magistrates hold that the police made “insufficient efforts” due to which liability of several guilty persons could not be determined. While 10,000 attended the protest, how were only 57 issued damage notices, they asked.

Among the well-known people to feature on the hoardings was S.R. Darapuri, a 76-year-old retired Dalit IPS officer and now social activist who identifies as an Ambedkarite. His arrest caused much furore among civil society as he was under house arrest on the day of the protest. The police claimed he served as a “catalyst” and enabler to the violent protest through his social media appeal to gather against the CAA and for attending a dharna, curiously described as a meeting by the police, on December 16 at the Ambedkar statue.

Darapuri responded to the notice by stating that he did not ever favour violence, nor did he make a call for it. While the Additional District Magistrate ruled that Darapuri did not provide any evidence to rebuff police allegations, Darapuri said the police have no evidence against him. Darapuri is unhappy that the Additional District Magistrate did not consider his explanation or hear his plea, and that the order was passed solely on the basis of the police report.

Moreover, the recovery order was not served on him and others like him till date, he said. “In the writ petition we filed in the High Court we submitted that we came to know about the illegal recovery order through these hoardings,” he said.

Authority to issue notices

While many questions arise on the individual cases and the contention over fixing culpability of the accused without any conviction, a larger question has been the legality of the competent authority to issue notices for damages, for the losses suffered during the public demonstration.

In February, the High Court had directed a stay on a recovery notice served on a Kanpur resident, Mohammad Faizan, by the administration, offering him “ad-interim protection” and said the matter relating to issuing notices to alleged vandals was already being heard in the Supreme Court, through a writ petition by Parwaiz Arif Titu challenging the state decision on competent authority. In a separate case, the High Court granted same relief to four others in Bijnor, citing the same argument.

Additional District Magistrate Trans-Gomti Vishwa Bhushan Mishra, who drafted the notices and orders in Lucknow, was confident they hold legal ground, and stated that “there is not a single stay against my notice or any other notice issued under my format.” Mishra, who has a degree in law, said: “If there was any question of legality, it could have been raised before the High Court and my order could have been stayed.” He also said he has been liberal with the orders and acquitted most of those who responded to the notices. He said the Kanpur order was quashed only due to techno-legal reasons.

On March 18, the Allahabad High Court asked the U.P. government to file a reply in the recovery of damages ordinances brought by it after PILs challenged them. Darapuri and others are waiting for the High Court to reopen so that their writ petition against the recovery order can be heard. Once the Supreme Court reopens, all eyes will be on how it takes up, first the question of the banners, which still stand in Lucknow, and then the larger issue of extracting punitive compensation from individuals who are yet to be convicted of crime by a court, but are subjected to public shame, insecurity and uncertainty.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kbbokz/article31186607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sadaat-Ali-Khan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/named-shamed-and-living-in-fear-on-lucknow-anti-caa-protests-and-the-accused/article31186615.ece

264,2020/03/28,Coronavirus | Treat for the fans as ICC opens archives,"Move enables fans to relive some of the greatest cricketing moments

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has opened its archives of match footage, providing fans with an opportunity to relive some of the greatest cricketing moments, including India’s World Cup triumphs as people stay indoors to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

The move will enable fans around the world to watch memorable cricket matches, highlights and ICC films at a time live sport programmes stand disrupted.

ICC events dating back to 1975, including the men’s and women’s ODI and T20 World Cups, the Champions Trophy as well as the U-19 World Cups have been made available to its broadcast partners.

“We are facing unprecedented times as a sports industry and the need to connect with our fan communities is perhaps greater than ever,” ICC chief executive Manu Sawhney said.

To unite the fans

“With no live cricket to unite our fans around the world, we thought the next best thing would be to release our archives to broadcast partners so fans can enjoy some magnificent memories.”

Additionally fans can join in the fun via Watch Parties on the ICC Facebook page where some of the most iconic games in the history of the sport will be replayed.

Match highlights and tournament recaps will also be delivered through ICC social channels and the ICC website and mobile App and fans can get involved and vote on the memories they want to see from the ICC archive.

Sports calenders have been shredded with the governments across the globe emphasising the need for social-distancing due to the coronavirus.

“We hope this move will help our broadcast partners replace cancelled sports fixtures with some highly engaging content and give cricket fans the opportunity to relive some of the great cricketing moments whilst we all stay at home,” Sawhney said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/coronavirus-treat-for-the-fans-as-icc-opens-archives/article31186785.ece
265,2020/03/28,"Coronavirus | Adhere to lockdown rules, pleads Kartik Murali","The experience of isolation when injured has helped the former India cricketer.

For a man used to “living out of a suitcase”, former India spinner Kartik Murali has “adapted” to a life indoors. The cricketer has lost little time in accepting the situation and also strictly adhering to lockdown rules.

“This is something that has never happened in our life. Can we fret or fume about it? Do we have control over it? From day one I never panicked. It was acceptance of the extraordinary circumstances.

“Focus was on ways to curb it now that the outbreak has happened. I have always been an outdoors person — golf, cricket, travelling — but not anymore.

“For the sake of the world, I have to stay indoors. I may miss my golf, but that is the smallest thing in the larger scheme of my responsibilities to the planet,” he says.

“It is a luxury to be at home, remember the homeless stranded all over the country. There will be issues to sort out in future, but now the challenge is to protect yourself and others. It pains all of us to see so many people struggling.

“I am shocked to see people venturing out for walks as if these are normal times. If you want to walk, walk inside your house. There is a compelling reason why the authorities want us to say at home. You can read, connect with friends, family and yourself. You can do what you could not for so many years,” Kartik said in a chat with The Hindu.

He spoke of his “respect” for people working to keep others safe. “My heart goes out to the health workers. To the doctors. To all the people providing essential things risking their own safety. I pray for them daily.

“I firmly believe that prayers and faith can move mountains,” said Kartik, who has made arrangements for the families of the domestic helps employed by him.

Time spent in isolation while attending to injuries in the past now helps him cope with the lockdown.

“I have had several injuries that kept me in isolation. When I had my knee and shoulder operated on I could not move out. I once got hit in Pakistan and I have had jaw-bone surgery.

“Once I was in bed for two months. The back injury kept me out of the 2001 ‘V.V.S. Laxman-Harbhajan Singh’ series (against Australia). All those occasions were spent at home,” he said.

Things to do

A voracious reader — like Sunil Gavaskar, W.V. Raman and Deep Dasgupta — Kartik has a few books to finish.

“I am currently reading The Lone Empress on the life of Jayalalithaa [former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister]. Next will be Half-Lion on P.V. Narasimha Rao [former Prime Minister]. I also have a list of movies to watch. We can all find ways to be busy.

266,2020/03/28,Vegetable wholesalers shift to temporary shops at bus stands,"District administration has taken steps to decongest the markets

The bus bays and platforms at the bus stand on Mettupalayam Road were converted into stalls for vegetable vendors on Saturday.

Nearly 250 vendors, who had shops at the Anna Market, shifted to the bus stand, located just opposite the market.

The district administration had taken efforts to decongest the vegetable markets in the city as a precautionary measure against spread of COVID-19 and alloted space at the Mettupalayam Road, Gandhipuram, and Ukkadam bus stands for the vegetable traders.

R. Rajalingam, a grocer from Karunanidhi Nagar, said he had stocked goods for a week even before the lockdown and had not purchased much during the last few days. He was at the Mettupalayam Road bus stand to buy vegetables for his shop.

Zakir Hussain, who has a stall at Anna market, for the last 23 years had spread out brinjals, okra, and broad beans at the market on Saturday. “The rates are moderate. But there is no supply of vegetables from places such as Dindigul, the Nilgiris and Karnataka. We were told about shifting temporarily to the bus stand on Friday and were given space at the bus stand,” he said.

At Ukkadam bus stand, about 120 shops, including 100 that sell vegetables, had moved to the Ukkadam bus stand from the Ukkadam market. The stalls are open from 4 a.m. to 10 a.m.

At Gandhipuram, the traders from Thyagi Kumaran market, numbering a more than 100, set shop a little later on Saturday.

Space has been allotted for 407 shops at the Mettupalayam Road bus stand. On Saturday, 250 sold the vegetables from there. All those who received vegetables from the Nilgiris did not set shop as there were no supplies. From Sunday, boxes and circles will be marked in front of each stall to ensure buyers stand in queues and maintain personal distancing, said an official.

S.K. Shahid Hamid, secretary of Ukkadam Market Vegetable Traders’ Association, said the traders had shifted to the bus stand at the request of the government. But they faced problems in transporting the vegetables. The police stopped the vehicles and if there were no vegetables after the sales, the traders had a tough time convincing the police, he said. The district administration can give passes to the association and it will distribute the passes, he added.

A group of traders at the Mettupalayam road bus stand also said that they faced challenges in transporting the vegetables. Sometimes they had to wait for nearly 30 minutes for the police to permit them to move.

“We are not getting vegetables from Ooty. The vehicle owners are not willing to travel to Coimbatore even if we are ready to pay rentals,” said one of the traders at Ukkadam.

According to Lawrence Agro Processing India, an integrated agriculture value chain firm, though the company has taken several measures to ensure its fleet managers and operators are adequately protected, there are restrictions in moving the vegetables from the Nilgiris to others parts of the State and other States too. Fresh fruits and vegetables are essential commodities.

“We sincerely request the State Governments to intervene on an immediate basis and clarify the position to the check post authorities who are playing an important role,” said Palat Vijayaraghavan, founder of LEAF.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/vegetable-wholesalers-shift-to-temporary-shops-at-bus-stands/article31194597.ece
267,2020/03/28,Migrant workers demand facilities to return home,"Migrant workers from about five States, who work in the construction sector or MSMEs, and are residing at Sundarapuram in the city on Saturday demanded facilities to return to their home towns and availability of food every day during the lockdown period.

Many of them came out on the street and the police spoke to them and persuaded them to go back to their houses here.

Migrant labourer Ramasish Paswan said there were around 500 labourers in Kamarajar Nagar and Sundarapuram, suffering without food and water.

“For the past few days, in the absence of work, we do not have money. Whatever little grains and cereals that many of us had, has been used. Where do we go for food and water,” he asked.

With month-end only a few days away, they had to pay rent and knowing their financial condition, landlords were forcing them to vacate the premises, complained Prince Kumar, a migrant worker from Nalanda, Bihar. Each of them paid ₹1,200 for a room that they shared with four, five or six persons, depending on the size. None had the money to pay rent.

“Our ration (food) is almost over. A few among us, have not had food for the last couple of days. We request the district administration to help us – either by sending us home, if possible, or lodge us at a shelter and provide food,” said Kumar, another worker.

Coimbatore District Collector K. Rajamani said they were given lunch on Saturday and the Revenue Divisional Officer, Coimbatore South, had a meeting with their employers. “The issue will be resolved,” he said. A senior revenue official said arrangements have been made to provide to the workers in that area during the lockdown period. The firms where they were employed had paid them their wages. But many did not have any money left with them.

N. Selvaraj, State joint general secretary of AITUC construction workers union, said nearly 500 migrant workers stay at Sundarapuram and go as daily wage earners to industries or construction work. They are all from West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh. They are paid directly by the employers. These workers do not have work now and cannot go back to their home towns. Their daily food requirements should be taken care of by the district administration.

There are several migrant workers stranded at construction sites near Nava India, Koundampalayam, Gounder Mills, and Selvapuram areas. Their contractors have returned to their respective States without providing adequately for the needs of the workers. The district administration should hold talks with the builders and property promoters and take care of these workers, he said.

S. Krishnamoorthi, Coimbatore district secretary of CITU, said the police had extended help to the migrant workers at Sundarapuram on Saturday. The union got information that 15 workers of West Bengal went without food for two days near Muthanankulam and the CITU members got for them their grocery needs. The district administration should identify such workers and take care of their food requirements.

P. Nallathambi, president of Coimbatore SIDCO Industrial Estate Manufacturers Welfare Association, said most of the migrant workers in Sundarapuram are contract workers. The Collector discussed the issue with the association on Saturday and it was decided that the association members will help in ensuring food supply to the workers. Podanur Police Inspector P. Maheswaran said that lati charge was a false and mischevious campaign on social media. When the workers gathered in large numbers snow balling into a law and order problem, police just chased them away from the road to the road side and enabled talks by revenue officials to assess their demands and to find ways and means to address them.

Despite moving the farmers’ market to open places to prevent overcrowding and to exercise personal distancing, public continue to turn up in large numbers here.

There are 11 uzhavar sandhais in the district and except for markets at Mettur, Jalakandapuram, Adayampatti and Thammampatti alternate space was provided for others here. Space for Sooramangalam farmers’ market and daily market at Palmarket area was provided at different bays at new bus stand.

Despite warnings and continuous announcements through microphones, public continued to crowd near vendors. Officials, police had to repeatedly guide public to exercise personal distancing and follow the circles. As many as 108 farmers had set up shop at new bus stand on Saturday and officials had painted circles at safe distance to ensure personal distancing between consumers.

Officials also asked vendors to not sell their produce if public crowded and failed to follow the queue.

V. Shakthi, one of the consumers said that public is not still aware of seriousness of situation. “I see public still purchasing in small quantities as they would do in a daily market and many turn up as families.

269,2020/03/28,R.G. Street witnesses massive crowd,"Coimbatore’s wholesale grocery market, R.G. Street, saw neighbourhood grocers throng wholesale shops on Saturday, when many opened after March 24, the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the lockdown call.

Coimbatore Maligai Vyaparigal Sangam (association of grocery traders) A Prabhakar said those who opened shops were only wholesale merchants and they supplied goods only in bulk – meaning, they sold goods only to neighbourhood grocers who were their customers.

“We did not sell in small quantities as that means more crowd. And, we opened shop today to avoid the rush on Monday, when we had originally planned to open the shops.”

Despite their appeal, the grocers crowded the Street and it took some time for regulation. “At my shop, we allowed only four customers at a time. We did this because we too are afraid and want to follow personal distancing practice.”

But, on the street, it was crowded because many grocers had arrived with their vehicles to take back goods to their respective areas.

Monday, the traders expected the situation to be different and therefore want the police to regulate he crowd. “The mere presence of police will deter the grocers from rushing to the shops. And, we, from the association are also willing to help,” he said.

The picture of crowded R.G. Street drew criticism on social media with various persons calling for stringent regulation and the need for ensuring personal distancing.

After the nationwide lockdown was announced, they were asked to return to their native by the Kerala police. On March 25, a total of 65 persons, including 20 women and three children, reached the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border on foot where they were examined and allowed to enter Tamil Nadu. A lorry proceeding towards Kallakurichi was stopped and they boarded the vehicle that reached Erode – Tiruppur district border at Noyal in Chennimalai on March 26.

Chennimalai police intercepted their vehicle and questioned them. The police learnt that they did not eat for two days and since they had undergone medical examination already they were allowed to proceed towards Perundurai and continue on the national highway. Media persons at Chennimalai arranged food for them at Perundurai and Chennimalai police went along with the lorry to reach Perundurai.

At Perundurai, doctors from Primary Health Centre at Thingalur screened the families and they were found without infection.

272,2020/03/28,Industries welcome RBI announcements,"Textile mills and micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) here have welcomed the announcements by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday.

Confederation of Indian Textile Industry and Southern India Mills’ Association said that the three months moratorium extended for the term loans and working capital interest and exemption for the moratorium period for asset re-classification and credit rating would help the industry.

The associations also welcomed the efforts of recalculating the drawing power to get additional working capital and reducing the repo rates and thereby reduce the bank interest rate.

Though three months moratorium had been extended for term loans and working capital interest, the RBI should clarify to extend moratorium for term loan interest payment as the financial year was coming to an end.

Fixed costs

The textile industry was power intensive and at least 25 % working capital without any collateral or margin money would be required for the textile and clothing sector to pay wages to the employees and to meet the fixed costs.

The Government should closely monitor the gravity of the problems and take appropriate steps to tide over the crisis by taking suitable policy measures.

The State government should extend the relief measures by deferring the current consumption charges for three months and waive off the demand charges for the lockdown period in line with the steps already initiated by a few State Governments.

According to Coimbatore Tirupur District Micro and Tiny Enterprises and Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage ane Tiny Enterprises, the micro industries would benefit from the moratorium extended for repayment of loans and the announcements made by the RBI.

The Tiruppur Exporters’ Association said measures such as deferment in repayment not to be treated as NPA and recalculating drawing power for working capital needs would benefit the industries.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/industries-welcome-rbi-announcements/article31194557.ece
273,2020/03/28,"Amma Unavagam to the rescue of daily wagers, homeless","P. Kannan, a native of Sowripalayam, is one among the small crowd waiting outside the budget canteen, Amma Unavagam, near the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital.

He will have to wait for a while till the clock strikes noon to have his lunch. It is his only source of food in the city, which is under lockdown as part of the effort to combat the spread of COVID-19 virus.

“This is where I’ve come to have food because every other restaurant or eatery is closed, including the place where I used to work,” says the casual labourer who usually works in kitchen.

Sixty-seven-year-old Saibaba Colony resident Anwar Basha too waits for the shutter to open. The widower who stays alone usually has his lunch at the Amma Unavagam. And, on Wednesday, too he made it to the place. “What if there’s no bus. I walked all the way to have lunch here as I usually do.”

For persons like S. Dhanasekar of Thoothukudi the Coimbatore Corporation’s decision to keep open the budget canteens has come as relief. “I’m stuck here since Tuesday evening as inter-district bus service is stopped. I wanted to make it home from Mettupalayam, where I was on an errand, before the lockdown but could not.”

With none to turn to in the district, he spent the night at a bus stand and used public convenience facility to refresh. “The decision to keep open the canteen is good for two reasons – one that it is a source of food and, two, at an affordable cost.”

Kannan’s friend J. Kumar, also a daily wager who sleeps at work place, says he wants the administration to provide food to the homeless. “If the collector takes homeless persons like me to a hall or some place and provide food, he can completely enforce lockdown. This will prevent persons like me from walking on streets for food and stop people from dying of hunger.”

The head of the self-help group that runs the Amma Unavagam says since Wednesday morning, the Corporation has asked the groups that run the eight canteens to increase the quantity of food served.

Usually the canteens cook 1,200 idlis for breakfast for 300 persons at four a person. It is now 1,900 to 2,000 idlis depending on the canteen.

Likewise, the quantity of food cooked for lunch has increased. And, a part of the food cooked in excess is for the Corporation’s conservancy workers, the head adds.

A Corporation officer says the civic body has asked the groups managing the canteens to take a call on providing dinner as well depending on the number of persons waiting. The budget canteens do not usually serve dinner but given the unprecedented circumstances, the civic body has asked them to. But the extraordinary situation has not changed something that the self-help groups encounter everyday: that of tipplers frequenting the place. A group member says she is surprised to find people managing to find liquor even though the State Government says it has ordered the closure of liquor outlets.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/amma-unavagam-to-the-rescue-of-daily-wagers-homeless/article31194554.ece
274,2020/03/28,When walls in Coimbatore turned into canvases,"Before the lockdown began, many artists had begun the task of bringing art out in the city’s streets

The Pullukadu Housing Unit at Ukkadam had a fresh new painting on its walls executed by St+art India Foundation, which promotes street art, in association with Coimbatore Corporation. Remember the walls of the Police Commissioner’s Office, the Cancer Ward at Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, St Francis Anglo Indian Girls School, Jawan’s Bhavan and the District Library? Each of them had been painted by artists from the foundation. “It was well received by the people and it encouraged us to come back here,” said Karan Kaul, assistant curator of St+art India Foundation.

The platform intends to take art out of gallery spaces into the streets. “This way we do not confine art to a particular group of society and instead make it equally accessible to everyone. This was a part of our Art District project. The other cities that come under this are Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Goa. We have plans to do more art in these districts in the future,” said Karan, who travelled around the city to identify areas that could be painted and discovered the housing unit. “We do site-specific work in keeping with the culture of the place. This is a resettlement area and the artworks here will tell stories of the city and the people living here,” he explained.

Avinash Kumar

For this edition, St+art India Foundation collaborated with five artists and the works were done before the 21-day national lockdown. Amitabh Kumar from Bengaluru painted migratory birds. “The Ukkadam lake is next to the building and I chose to paint the falcon and the pelican that visit this lake,” he said. “The migratory birds symbolise the earlier life of the people who once did not have any place they could call their home. Now the building is their home and the tree you see is the symbol of their rootedness to this place,” he explains. He describes his experience of working in Coimbatore as an “absolute pleasure. The people were friendly and offered us tea, coffee and food.”

For another artist, Avinash Kumar, the inside of the building inspired him. “It has long passageways and rooms. I plan to paint a child playing with a paper plane. I want the whole world to see how beautiful the homes of the people living here are,” he says. “Street art gives people experience of the whole process from the beginning. They see the image take shape in front of their eyes.” Avinash’s work had to be stopped due to the coronavirus pandemic and he hopes to resume it soon.

Chifumi, a French artist now settled in Cambodia has drawn two hands in a Yoni mudra.“The building has several people from the transgender community. I dedicate this work to them. I had designed and sketched the work before I came to the city,” he says. Chifumi has been doing street art for the past 10 years and feels that the energy that street art spread to be “very intense.”

Closer home, Coimbatore based artist V Jeevananthan has painted elephants. “The style resembles a movie poster or a comic strip. It is done intentionally to attract the attention of kids,” he explains. He collaborated with Gujarat based Muneer Bukhari for this work. “We discussed it before coming up with this piece. I drew a sketch and it was later reproduced on the walls,” he says. This is the biggest project done by Jeevananthan so far. “ It is 45 feet tall! I started my career by drawing a cinema poster on canvas in 1980. I stopped it 15 years ago and it felt nostalgic to do a work in a similar style,” he smiles.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ldzzik/article31191138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ChifumiJeswin-Rebello,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/start-india-foundation-in-association-with-coimbatore-corporation-has-done-four-street-art-at-the-the-pullukadu-housing-unit-in-ukkadam/article31191141.ece

276,2020/03/28,Residents falling in line to fight COVID-19 outbreak,"‘The governments are doing their best and we should play our part too’

For a city where forming queues is not part of the culture, enforcing social distancing has been a challenge.

From drawing boxes and circles outside establishments to hiring security guards to ensure proper distancing, grocery shops, pharmacies and banks have tried several measure to ensure Delhiites fall in line while maintaining a distance.

“It takes just one person to request everybody to adhere to social distancing and then they follow. It is not like people are unaware of the concept... they just forget that they have to,” said Govind Rishi, a resident of GK.

Good reminder

It helps when stores draw circles outside their shops as it reminds people that they are expected to maintain a distance, he added.

For many, seeing wide adherence to social distancing has come as a surprise. “I went to buy medicine at a shop in Laxmi Nagar and was amazed to see people following the social distancing rule by standing inside marked circles outside the shop. Now, people are falling in line,” said Amit Yadav, a resident of east Delhi.

In riot-hit north-east Delhi, people could be seen lining up outside shops and maintaining social distance without the assistance of any circles or markings, where shops selling essential commodities like medical shops and grocery stores, people maintained social distance on their own accord and in absence of any markings.

Many shopkeepers have put up ropes in front of the counters to maintain distance.

“We stand at a distance from one other whether or not in queues. The governments are doing their best and we should play our part too,” said Ali Raza, a 39-year-old resident of Mustafabad who had come to buy medicines.

Exception

In Greater Noida’s Omega 1 market next to the Yamuna Expressway Authority, social distancing norms took a backseat.

Shoppers wore masks but did not refrain from physical contact with each other as they thronged payment counters and bumped into each other along the narrow isles at the Everyday Shopping Mart and the Soni Superstore. Unlike many shops, the stores were not capping the number of customers allowed inside at one time, leading to overcrowding.

There was no cap on the number of customers inside either store which, in turn, led to congestion inside.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/8c5j67/article31195269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28DELPRIYASTORES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/residents-falling-in-line-to-fight-covid-19-outbreak/article31195270.ece
277,2020/03/28,Authorities sort out complaints of doctors asked to vacate houses,"‘Such requests by landlords put many lives in danger’

The district administration helpline has received a couple of calls regarding landlords asking their tenants — either doctors or people under home quarantine — to vacate their premises immediately. The authorities have, however, intervened and bailed out the complainants.

Helpline number

Under trainee IAS officer, Aprajita, supervising the Helpline 1950, told The Hindu that three-four calls were received, including landlords asking a home quarantine patient and a doctor to vacate their premises in separate cases.

Ms. Aprajita said the police were informed and they reached the spot immediately to sort out the matter.

“We are taking such complaints very seriously because doctors are our front line soldiers. They are very important in the present situation. Even the home quarantine patients are also just following the directions of the Prime Minister. If a man under home quarantine is asked to leave, it is not just that discomfort is caused to them, but several lives are also put into danger. So it requires police action,” said Ms. Aprajita.

COVID-19 case

A woman doctor at Gurugram’s Civil Hospital and a nurse in a private hospital in the city have tested positive for COVID-19.

Gurugram Deputy Commissioner had also tweeted from his official handle on Friday saying: “Distt Admin is receiving complaints on helpline regarding landlords/house owners asking medical staff, labourers and people under precautionary home quarantine to vacate the house immediately. Such immoral act may lead to registration of FIR against such landlords/house owners [sic].”

279,2020/03/28,Basic amenities ready for students in hostels: DU,"Arrangements too late as many were forced to leave days ago: students

Delhi University (DU) on Saturday said that arrangements have been made for the basic requirements of students who are still living in the hostels and are unable to return home due to the shutdown of non-essential services.

“University of Delhi stands in solidarity with the students residing in the hostels, who could not leave for their hometowns due to travel adversaries as a result of nationwide lockdown. All necessary basic amenities have been arranged for them,” the university said in a statement, adding: “Mess facility is operational in the university-maintained hostels. Adequate medical attention has been ensured to bonafide residents.”

Several hostel residents, however, said that the arrangements were too little too late as many students had been forced to leave the hostels several days ago.

“There was panic as hostel residents were asked to make alternative arrangements. While most of us left some had to stay back as they could not make other arrangements. We had to convince the authorities to allow students to stay,” said Amisha Nanda, a first-year student of the Faculty of Law.

Christina Ering, a resident of the North-Eastern Students House for Women, said: “We had to threaten authorities with legal action to be able to make people stay in the hostel. It is not easy for people to go back to the Northeast as some had connecting flights and buses, which were cancelled. Not all have local guardians.

Delhi Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam on Saturday visited the Anand Vihar depot and urged the daily wagers and migrant workers to remain in the city, while assuring them that arrangements for basic necessities had been made by the State government.

In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, hundreds of migrant workers and labourers were seen embarking on a journey of walking back to their villages, in the absence of public transport. Mr. Gautam, who is the Minister of Social Welfare, said, “The Delhi government has ensured that each one of you has an adequate supply of food. We have arranged for food and other necessities in our night shelters as well as various government schools. There is no need to worry.

Arrangements to feed those in need have been been put in place at 568 schools and 238 night shelters in Delhi, he said, even as flying squad teams have also been engaged in distributing food packets across the city.

“The Delhi government is working hard to ensure that the people of Delhi remain safe and healthy. Our capacity for providing food to 4 lakh people across the city is ready. Today, arrangements have been made in 568 schools for the city, and food is also being served in 238 night shelters. Around 800-825 total food shelters have been created in Delhi,” he said.

“The Delhi government’s flying squads are also distributing food items to the needy across the city. It was the first day of serving 4 lakh people with food. There must be shortcomings and teething problems in the centres, I hope things will be streamlined from tomorrow and there will be no problems,” he said.

Mr. Kejriwal sought to urge migrant workers and others leaving the city to stay back stating that arrangements for their stay as well as to feed them had been put in place.

Mr. Kejriwal said he had spoken to the city’s legislators visiting their respective constituencies asking them to appeal to such people to stay in Delhi and to inform them that the government was arranging for food and shelter for them.

“We have been able to stop some of them, but all of the others are worried about their future as they think it is going to be a long process. I want to appeal to them again that the Delhi government has made all arrangements for you and we are trying our best to help you,” he said.

‘Necessary lockdown’

“I also want to say that the decision to implement a nationwide lockdown announced by the Prime Minister is absolutely necessary. If we do not abide by the lockdown, we are exposing our nation to the risk of the COVID-19 outbreak as we have observed in other nations.

The police have told the public to be aware of clicking on any unverified weblinks while searching for information related to COVID-19 on the Internet.

“We have cautioned people against opening suspicious emails and clicking on unverified links related to COVID-19 being circulated on social media platforms,” said a police officer.

In a tweet, the West district police said that cyber criminals are capitalising on the fear among people regarding the virus outbreak.

As per the tweet, the scammers create fraudulent social media accounts claiming to sell and deliver medical products. The victims are asked to pay via bank transfers. “A fraudster, pretending to be a relative currently being treated at hospital for COVID-19, calls the victim and asks them to pay for the cost of the medical treatment,” the tweet stated.

The fraudsters send emails related to the pandemic, claiming to be health authorities, with the aim of tricking victims into connecting to a specific webpage and to login with their real email address and password. Scammers then use their credentials to access sensitive information and potentially to steal their money, the police said.

The police have asked people to avoid opening suspicious emails and clicking on unverified links related to COVID-circulated on the social media.

Less than 48 hours after launching the ‘Gurugram movement passes’ scheme to allow hassle-free movement to those in an emergency or involved in delivery of essential services, the district administration has received over 11,000 applications.

A majority of the applications, however, sought passes on flimsy grounds such as “need to take wife to her parents’ home as part of a ritual after wedding” or “need to bring back son from his grandmother’s place in Punjab” or “need to take the dog to the veterinarian as he is not eating his meals”.

Essential services

Chief Executive Officer (Zila Parishad) Kulbir Dhaka, one of the two approvers, told The Hindu that the flood of ‘flimsy’ requests have delayed the clearance process for genuine applications.

“We have 11,157 applications so far. Even if I take one minute to clear an application, it will take me a week to dispose off them all,” said Mr. Dhaka, adding that only 2,800 applications have been processed so far out of which 1,586 — mostly associated with essential services — were allowed.

Mr. Dhaka has appealed to residents to seek a pass only in unavoidable circumstances.

“A pass must be sought in case of a prior appointment with the doctor, but in case of medical exigency, such as heart attack, it can be avoided,” he added.

The suppliers of essential services also need passes. Individuals are being one-day passes while organisations are being given passes that are valid for seven days, Mr. Dhaka said.

Besides two computer operators, the representatives of the District Food and Supply Controller office and Industry are also part of the team to grant the passes. “The DFSC and Industry representatives help us verify the claims of essential services suppliers,” said Mr. Dhaka.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/gurugram-receives-11k-requests-for-movement-passes/article31195234.ece

After eight people, who attended a religious congregation at a mosque in Nizamuddin in New Delhi, were tested positive for COVID-19, the authorities in Delhi are looking for people who were part of the congregation.

On Friday, a total of six persons tested positive for COVID-19 in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. All of them went to Delhi to attend a religious programme and returned to Port Blair via Kolkata on Tuesday, said a senior officer.

On Thursday, a 65-year-old man isnfected with COVID-19 died at a hospital in Srinagar. He had also attended congregation at Nizamuddin and travelled to Kashmir by train.

In another case, a 52-year-old returned to his town Guntur after attending a religious congregation at the mosque in Nizamuddin and was tested positive for COVID-19.

“We are getting more details of people who attended the congregation and alerting the States to which they belong. We have isolated the people where the event was organised,” said an officer.

A senior police officer said that they are assisting medical teams operating in Nizamuddin area and conducting random checks to detect if there is any mass spread of COVID-19, besides recommending home quarantine to many people.

“Medical teams are functioning in the area for the past one week and taking samples to detect any community spread of the virus. We are coordinating with other authorities to track down people who went back to their towns after attending the congregation,” said the officer.

286,2020/03/28,Sea of humanity engulfs Kaushambi bus depot,"Bus service announced by Uttar Pradesh government brings relief to migrant labourers walking to their destinations

A sea of people flooded the Kaushambi U.P. Roadways Bus Depot on Saturday evening as the State government was forced to resume bus service for 48 hours for migrant labourers to reach their destinations. Throwing the appeal for social distancing to the wind, the passengers rushed to occupy all possible spots on the buses.

Having spent many hours on the road walking, they were simply relieved, notwithstanding the dangers of COVID-19 or the fact that they still had to find the bus to their route.

No match

The police presence could not match the number of people, but the passengers were following basic discipline. Half-a-dozen policemen were stationed on the stairs to the bridge, teeming with people, that connects Anand Vihar bus stand to Kaushambi bus depot.

“We are targeting to clear it [the rush] by tonight. As you can see, given the number of people, we cannot even test the temperature. But we are informing the district officials of the destination of every bus. They would check every passenger before they deboard,” said ADM (City) Shailendra Kumar Singh, who was grappling with the “unprecedented” situation.

On the delay, he said, “There was little we could do. We were waiting for orders from the top. Apart from government buses, we are also engaging private ones.” Mr. Singh, however, refused to give a specific number of the government and private buses ferrying passengers. “We are providing food to at least 20,000 people,” he added.

Local NGOs and workers of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh could be seen distributing oranges and pulao to passengers. Asked why they didn’t turn up on Friday, one of them said, “We were there, you might have missed us.”

U.P. Roadways official Subhash Mishra, who was manning the Mohan Nagar Depot, said, “The buses would be checked at every depot so that the driver and conductor do not take the passengers for a ride. I feel the plight of these people should have been taken into account before the lockdown was announced. Now, this window has given an opportunity to even those who don’t really need to leave the city. There is clear difference in the kind of people who were pleading for support on Friday and those who are enquiring today,” he said.

On speaking to a cross section of migrant workers, however, it was clear that not all of them belonged to the same economic strata. Many of them saw it beneath their dignity to queue up for free food. “I pay ₹2,000 as rent. I would like to buy my food. It is just that I am caught in an unprecedented situation where I don’t know whether I would get my salary for the next month. The government should have thought of people like us.

290,2020/03/28,"Stuck at Raja Garden night shelter, people long to get home","Shutdown of non-essential services forces people from other States to stay back

At a night shelter in west Delhi’s Raja Garden, a 45-year-old woman from Assam’s Guwahati, who was not sure how long she would be stuck and when she would get to see her husband who works in Punjab, was in tears.

The nationwide shutdown of non-essential services has forced Rinku Mani Borah to live in the women’s section of the night shelter run by DUSIB where all she got was a mat and a pillow .

Her husband had, before the said shutdown, asked her to go to Punjab before “it gets worse”. She had even boarded a train on March 21, but when she reached New Delhi railway station, she was told that the train would not go further. The tragedy, however, did not end there.

“I did not know what to do. I asked a police officer where I could go and he said that I could sleep on the platform. When I woke up in the morning, my purse which had ₹3,000, my PAN card, Voter-ID card and my phone were missing,” she said. She was asked to leave as railway stations were also being vacated.

She wandered on the streets, went to temples and platforms, asking for help befre an autorickshaw driver, Raju, came to her rescue. “He asked why I was crying. I told him everything and he told me about this night shelter. I came here on Friday,” she said, adding that she has spoken to her husband in Punjab and informed him about the situation. “I don’t know when I will be able to go home,” she said before Khushi, a transgender, brought her lunch.

Ms. Khushi, whose parents disowned her four years ago, dances at religious events for a living and has been staying at the night shelter since three years. “These days, because of the disease [COVID-19], I am not getting work. At times, I also opt for begging, but not in Delhi. I go to Gurugram because my parents live in west Delhi only. People in our community have been struggling a lot,” she said.

Flaunting her Facebook page, she said, she used to get work from there. “Many people think we already have some kind of disease and this [COVID-19] has added to our problems,” she said.

Rinku Sagar, Amit and Tarun, who were on their way home to Agra from Nepal where they work as labourers in a factory, are also stuck. Their families, they said, are worried for their safety.

Mr. Rinku said that the three of them were asked by their employer to leave for their homes on March 21 and were handed ₹1,500 each, adding that they had left immediately.

They managed to reach Gorakhpur from where they took an Agra-bound train but were stopped at Lucknow and were told that the train would not go to Agra. “We then thought of taking a Delhi-bound train and sat in one, but were stopped by the TTE at Moradabad for not having a ticket,” he said. Next, they hitched a ride to Delhi and the driver took ₹800 from them.

A passer-by guided them to the night shelter where they have been staying since Monday. “We thought of walking as well but we don’t have enough money,” he said adding that the night shelter was in a “decent condition”.

Inhabitants at the shelter stood and sat close to each other, some of them wearing masks, as a traffic police officer right outside and caretakers asked people to maintain distance. While the inhabitants said that “everything is fine here, including the food”, they are not provided with soaps or hand sanitisers to wash hands.

“We really need soaps to wash hands. At any given point, there are at least 200 people living here and all stay close to each other. Soaps and sanitisers are the need of the hour,” said Ram Singh, a labourer.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/z3rsh8/article31195180.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29DESHELTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/stuck-at-raja-garden-night-shelter-people-long-to-get-home/article31195181.ece

The “Zero Point” on the Yamuna Expressway on Saturday transformed into a surging sea of migrant workers left with no option but to return home. But while they have a pressing need to do so as COVID-19 has deprived them of a livelihood in the national capital, the main casualty of the exodus is the physical distancing required to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Headed to Agra, Aligarh, Lucknow and in some cases, to destinations in various districts of Bihar, wave after wave of out-of-work migrant workers and their families thronged the location, a few metres from where the expressway connecting Gautam Buddha Nagar to Agra in Uttar Pradesh originates, to try their luck at boarding a vehicle.

Early in the morning, the district administration announced that 200 State-run buses had been arranged to ferry commuters to various locations every two hours from the area. The question “If not this, what else?” was as ubiquitous as the confusion on their faces and the backpacks — packed tightly with the odds and ends they could muster in a hurry — on their shoulders.

“I want to go to Kanpur; since there are no trains available, any form of transport which takes me anywhere close to my destination from here will do at this point. I’m going to die soon any way. If I stay here it will be of hunger, if I contract the infection, I can at least die on my own soil,” Manish Kumar said. He used to work at a cloth factory at Kasna, which has been shut for a week now.

“I have a small wholesale fruits business. The weather changed and all my stock got destroyed because there was no one to supply ice or a place to store my stock. I’d rather go home than go hungry or beg here. What else is there to do?” said Kapil, who was looking to travel home to Agra. A head constable attached to the Alpha 2 police station and deployed on the Expressway said the number of commuters had increased since the government’s announcement. “We are trying to help as many people as we can to get on both private and government vehicles after the announcement this morning. Buses operated by the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation have been deployed. We are trying to ensure that as many passengers as possible get aboard,” he said.

Set aflutter each time a vehicle — whether an SUV, a minivan or a bus loaded with passengers occupying even its roof — would slow down near it, the gathering of over a hundred-odd hopeful commuters would slightly decrease in number every two to five minutes before more would join it, having walked several kilometres to be a part of it.

Being fed vegetarian biriyani and provided water by some volunteers from the back of their vehicles, the workers would thank their benefactors inattentively, their eyes fixed on the road in front of them.

“Things are really bad here... You know what is happening, then why do you keep asking? I’ve told you I’m on my way. I have nowhere else to go, I will come home soon, trust me,” Animesh, a factory hand, said as he broke down while talking to his mother on the phone as he looked down from the elevated arches of the highway he was on.

“They should have allowed us to come here two days ago,” he complained. “For two whole days, both in the morning and the evening, I tried to come here so I could catch a bus or use any other means to go home in Munger [Bihar].

293,2020/03/28,Terror conspiracy case: Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist sent to police custody till Apr 4,"Special Judge Gurvinder Pal Singh sent Syed Naveed Mushtaq to police custody till April 4

A court here has sent an alleged Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist to police custody in a case in which Jammu and Kashmir Police officer Davinder Singh was arrested earlier.

Special Judge Gurvinder Pal Singh sent Syed Naveed Mushtaq to police custody till April 4 on Friday after the police said he and the other accused in the case were planning to execute terror attacks in Delhi and other parts of the country and targeted killings of protected persons.

Singh, a deputy superintendent of police arrested for allegedly ferrying two Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists, was suspended by the Jammu and Kashmir Police in January.

Seeking Mushtaq’s custody, the police alleged that the accused was the Hizbul Mujahideen commander of Shopian district and his handler was based in Pakistan.

They said Mushtaq used to chat with the other accused in the case and militants on various internet platforms, including darknet chat.

“The accused, along with other Hizbul Mujahideen militants, was planning to execute terror attacks in Delhi and other parts of the country and targeted killings of protected persons,” the police told the court.

They said the accused was required to be confronted with Singh and the other accused in the case to ascertain his role, trace the details of financial transactions, verify and trace other offenders, and establish the identity of the main handler.

The defence counsel, Prashant Prakash, opposed the application, saying the accused was falsely implicated in the case and was not required to be sent to police custody.

“In the fact of the matter and considering the submissions, accused Syed Naveed Mushtaq is remanded in police custody till April 4,” the judge said.

The Special Cell of the Delhi Police had earlier brought Singh to Delhi from the Hira Nagar Jail in Jammu and Kashmir.

The Delhi Police had earlier filed a First Information Report (FIR) under section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. The FIR said youngsters from Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab were being trained for carrying out terrorist activities.

The FIR also mentioned “D Company” and Chhota Shakeel. According to the FIR, the Special Cell had received an input that the “D Company” was funding pro-Khalistan terror organisations in Punjab.

Singh was taken into custody pursuant to this FIR and the Special Cell had interrogated him as regards the Khalistan angle, police said.

Although Singh was not named in the FIR, he will be questioned on the basis of the inputs received by the Special Cell, they added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pyzf7f/article31190788.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-KASHMIR-PAKISTAN-CONFLICT-POLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/terror-conspiracy-case-hizbul-mujahideen-terrorist-sent-to-police-custody-till-apr-4/article31190789.ece

296,2020/03/28,How Coimbatore dealt with epidemics in the past,"In the light of the current Coronavirus epidemic, city chronicler Rajesh Govindarajulu recalls earlier visitations of plague and smallpox

Coimbatore has seen many epidemics before the current Coronavirus, says Coimbatore’s historian Rajesh Govindararulu. It has had nearly 10 visitations of the plague; the first recorded one was in 1903 and the last in 1942. And several serious outbreaks of small pox. In his book Idhuvo Engal Kovai, Kovai Kizhar CM Ramachandran, says that approximately 3,500 people died each time the plague struck at the turn of the 20th Century.

Naatu vaidyars were active in treating people, saays Rajesh. In 1903, there is evidence of an imposing man, on his horse, distributing medicines. This was Periya Govinda Swamy Naidu (1858-1916 ) and the father of G Kuppuswamy Naidu. A naatu marundhu kadai functioned from his home and it was common to see him visit afflicted households along with two other practitioners of native medicine, Sodalamuthu and Bhashyakarulu, and an assistant. There is also record of one CK Subramanium Mudaliar., who got the plague in the 1900s and moved from Vysial Street to Ramanathapuram where his wife Meenakshi nursed him back to health. She also nursed others with the help of another naatu vaidhyar called Murugaiya Pandithar.

Thankfully, casualties diminished over the years as hygiene and awareness improved. Newly formed localities were better at keeping their surroundings clean. Doctors went around and announcements were made by sanitary workers. A special task force called the Plague Police patrolled the city. Rajesh mentions a person called Hafiz Sahib who ensured hygiene was maintained and that people were vaccinated. There was reluctance and fear in coming forward to be inoculated and the authorities had to pay people to be inoculated. Men were paid six annas, women three and children two if they stepped up. If anyone hid information connected to plague, they were punished, as were those who visited the plague affected household. The municipality also took it upon itself to supply households with rat-traps with bait.

Predictably, many people wanted to leave the city for safer destinations. Usually they set off on pilgrimages. But they could not just up and leave. They were checked for the disease and, if found uninfected, issued a ‘plague passport’. The sanitary officer at the destination would check the plague passport and only then permit entry. This was 100 years ago!

Divine succour came from Plague Mariamman or Black Mariamman. People flocked to her temple located between Big Bazaar and Raja streets, and walked on fire with faith and hope. They carried lemons, turmeric, gooseberries and neem — all said to build immunity on their heads. The Thoraiyar Veedhi Bhadrakaliamman (near Vysial Street) also dispensed her grace in the trying times.

Fevers and pandemics were common those days and they spread rapidly especially during temple festivals. It goes to the credit of Dr G T Gopalakrishna Naidu (1900-1991) who inoculated people by the thousands in order to keep them safe.

Smallpox was the other scourge. Rajesh’s grandfather R Krishnan got it in 1930 when he was 10 years old. His grandmother moved him to the outhouse, and laid him down on banana leaves and nursed him. She assured him he would come out of it stronger and live long. He lived for 95 years (died in 2016),”says Rajesh adding that people were advised against making fun of people’s pockmarks. They were warned that Amman would disapprove and tthat they would be visited by the pox. But inoculation worked wonders and the epidemic died out.

Rajesh clearly remembers seeing a poster near Town Hall in 1975. “It announced a reward of ₹5, 000 to anyone who shared information about people who had smallpox! The Tamil Nadu government knew that no one would because it had been comprehensibly eradicated.”

Another indelible memory of that day is “returning from the Dandu MariammanTemple after recovering from my chicken pox attack and, more importantly, being bought my first Amar Chitra Katha (The Pandava Princes). I still have it. It was Issue 13, and it cost ₹1.50!”",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/en2hr/article31191452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CMPLAGUEMARIAMMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/coimbatores-chronicler-rajesh-govindarajulu-on-past-epidemics-in-the-city/article31191454.ece
297,2020/03/28,Corona fear robs Rajasthan’s Gangaur festival of its sheen,"Rajasthan women celebrate Gangaur festival through video conferencing, following the lockdown advisory in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak

The festival of Gangaur was a silent one, as women stayed indoors within their houses and celebrated the festival via video conferencing, due to nationwide lockdown following the Coronavirus outbreak.

Every year, women would celebrate singing together under one roof and listen to the story associated with this festival. They would also take part in a procession and offer their prayers to Shiva and Parvati.

However, this year they took to Skype, WhatsApp and Google chat. On Thursday, police officials had issued an advisory requesting women to stay at home and celebrate the festival online. Women of the same family were also directed to maintain social and personal distancing while praying at home.

This is the first time in the nearly three century old history of Jaipur that the Gangaur Festival failed to make a mark. A royal procession, which was been an annual ritual since 1828, was not taken out either.

Jaipur’s City Palace administration took this decision following government advisory which did not allow more than five people to gather at one place in wake of COVID-19 pandemic.

Ramu Ramdev, who looks after Jaipur’s museum, affirmed that this is the first instance when Gangaur procession has not been taken out here since the formation of Jaipur princely state. However, the prayers were offered by a few people inside the palace.

Jaipur came into being in 1728 and the Gangaur procession began in 1828, from City Palace. The annual ritual became a part of the city’s culture. Ramdev added that the Gangaur procession was also taken out before the formation of Jaipur, when the state capital was in Amer.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/rajasthan-women-celebrate-gangaur-festival-through-video-conferencing/article31190684.ece

While complaints about police high-handedness and free-wheeling baton charge in the capital city are still trickling in, it appears that police vigilance ends at city limits.

The goods vehicle started from Suryapet around 6 p.m. and crossed at least ten temporary police barricaded checkposts in Suryapet, Nalgonda district, and Rachakonda Commissionerate during night curfew from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. - announced by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to restrict people’s movement on road.

Role of subcontractor

According to the police, Ashok, a subcontractor with DRMS Road Engineering firm, arranged the vehicle from Raichur to ‘illegally’ send back the migrant workers and their families.

“Driver Hanuma Gowda reached Suryapet on Friday afternoon after obtaining a permission letter from Raichur police to bring workers to the home town in Raichur and Yadgir districts,” a police officer unwilling to be named said. He said that the mini-van was stopped at two checkposts in Suryapet and was let off after women and children in the vehicle repeatedly requested the police officers. “Though rules won’t permit, officers deployed at checkposts allowed them to go on humanitarian grounds when the curfew was on,” the officer told The Hindu. Meanwhile, Amaresh, a migrant labourer who survived the ghastly accident said that they wanted to go back to their village as there was no work in Suryapet. “We came here to earn money. How can we survive without money?,” he asked. When asked on how they managed to escape police checking, he said that Hanuma Gowda got police permission from Karnataka and when the vehicle was stopped for checking, all women and children used to get down and plead with the police officials.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/police-humane-approach-to-blame/article31195295.ece
300,2020/03/28,"Supply of onion, potato from other States resumes","Traders can get permits for transport of vegetables, fruits

The Agricultural Marketing Department has initiated steps to streamline the supplies of vegetables in the State by arranging their transport from other States and within the State.

Coordination with the officials of other States has become necessary following the problems being faced in the transportation of vegetables from far-off places in the wake of lockdown being implemented across the country to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

According to Minister for Agriculture and Marketing S. Nirajan Reddy, the Marketing Department officials are closely monitoring the movement of onion supplies from Maharashtra and potato from Uttar Pradesh.

The supply of onion from Maharashtra, which was only 1,800 quintals on Friday, has increased to 6,500 quintals on Saturday.

The measures are being taken to ensure that there is no shortage of essentials such as vegetables and fruits during the lockdown period, which is till April 14 as of now. The Minister suggested the traders that they could get permits for transport of vegetables and fruits from other States as well as within the State from the Marketing Department officials.

Vendors cautioned

He cautioned the vendors, including the retailers and street-corner sellers, against selling the essentials at exorbitant prices.

Mobile Rythu Bazaars

Meanwhile, mobile Rythu Bazaars will henceforth visit colonies across the city, and provide vegetables for reasonable prices. Marketing Department, in coordination with the GHMC, has organised a total of 177 mobile Rythu Bazaars, which have visited 331 locations on Saturday.

Timings of visit to each location have been scheduled, so as not to deprive any area of vegetables.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/d5xoix/article31195284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy29vegetable,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/supply-of-onion-potato-from-other-states-resumes/article31195285.ece
301,2020/03/28,Poultry prices rise; mutton might soon go off the plate,"Scarcity may prove to be a real dampener ahead of Ramzan

Less than a day after Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao urged people to consume non-vegetarian food to build strength and immunity against the novel coronavirus infection, prices of poultry have shot up, and mutton is unavailable at most markets.

Poultry prices, which had remained at rock bottom till a week ago over rumours that chicken consumption caused coronavirus, have drastically recovered now.

On Saturday, when several people abstain from non-vegetarian food for religious reasons, broiler chicken (skinless) was sold at ₹188 to ₹195 per kilogram across various brands.

“It will touch ₹200 tomorrow, and cross ₹250 over the next week,” G. Santhosh, a retailer of Sneha Chicken outlet in Kothapet postulated. Prices touched their nadir about two weeks ago, when a kilogram was sold at throw away prices of ₹20 to ₹30. “It was ₹50 per kg even last week. Attracted by the low prices, customers bought in large quantities, resulting in total clearance of poultry shelves. There will be scarcity till fresh chicks arrive,” says Mr. Santhosh.

Hovering at ₹150 per kilogram at the beginning of the week, the price rise was also aided by panic buying by consumers out of fear generated by lockdown.

Price of layer eggs too has recovered on equal terms, from ₹36 per dozen last week, up to ₹58 per dozen on Saturday.

Mutton, the preferred meat of true blue Hyderabadis, might soon go off the plate thanks to the scarcity generated by lockdown. Similar is the situation of beef too. The scarcity could prove to be a real dampener ahead of Ramzan month, which is as much looked forward to by pious Muslims as by gourmets from other religions.

The scarcity is attributed to the country-wide lockdown owing to which it has become difficult to bring in livestock.

“Animals have to be brought down from States such as Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Haryana and Karnataka, which has become impossible during the lockdown. Very small numbers are trickling in at the slaughter houses which too will become nil in the days to come,” an official from GHMC informed.

Md. Jahangir, a meat retailer, too says mutton will disappear from markets in the coming few days, as bringing the animals even from other districts within the State has become riskier.

“My own animals are stuck at Nalgonda, as the police is not allowing any trucks to pass by. Foreseeing this situation, I brought animals ahead of the lockdown. The last 12 are remaining and they too will be finished on Sunday. Thereafter, there will be no mutton sales,” he declares.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/poultry-prices-rise-mutton-might-soon-go-off-the-plate/article31195277.ece
302,2020/03/28,Battling COVID-19 with a colonial-era law,"Why govt. has taken recourse to Epidemic Diseases Act, 1987, in March 2020

On March 21, the State government invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act that was passed on February 4, 1897, in Imperial Calcutta (Kolkata). A few days earlier, the West Bengal government also invoked the same Act to arm itself against the COVID-19 pandemic. Other Indian States took recourse to the same Act that was created at the height of terror over bubonic plague in Bombay (Mumbai).

Why Epidemics Act 1897?

In the absence of any new legislation to fight epidemics, Indian States had to resort to this colonial-era law to manage the outbreak. The law arms the State with emergency powers that allow it to carry out search operations as well as penalise people violating the provisions of the law. The law was created at a time when the disease was ill-understood. An immunisation programme used Haffkine’s Prophylactics which was first tested on its creator, Waldemar Mordechai Wolff Haffkine. The magical potion used 1.5 kg of meat, 25 cc of Hydrochloric Acid and 60 grammes of caustic soda to extract the immunising agent. But before that, thousands died every year and the panic led to many people fleeing the cities and taking the disease with them to their native places. The exchange from the report on Indian Plague Commission shows the problem of people fleeing quarantine existed from that time:

“When a segregated patient gets plague, does he go back to the camp, or does he go and hide himself?”

“I know that we have taken out cases from these segregated people — contact people —, and sent them to hospital.”

It was to tackle this problem that the Epidemic Diseases Act was created.

Is the law enough?

In the first instance, it is enough. The police officials who are beating up people or punishing them cannot be hauled to court. The ED Act gives them protection: “Protection to persons acting under Act. No suit or other legal proceeding shall lie against any person for anything done or in good faith intended to be done under this Act.”

The States also invoked Section 188 of Indian Penal Code (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) to take care of the medical emergency.

Then, to deal with an epidemic of this scale in a globalised world, the antiquated laws are surely not enough. The States have also invoked Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act of 2005 to deal with people spreading fake news: “Whoever makes or circulates a false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic, shall on conviction, be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to one year or with fine.”

What now?

If the government had followed the National Disaster Management Guidelines (NDMG) of 2008, the situation would have been different. India would have had a comprehensive Act where it would not have had to take recourse to a 123-year-old law when airports didn’t exist.

“The Epidemic Diseases Act was enacted in 1897 and needs to be repealed. This Act does not provide any power to the Centre to intervene in biological emergencies. It has to be substituted by an Act which takes care of the prevailing and foreseeable Public health needs including…international spread of diseases,” says the NDMG-2008. As health is a State subject, without an overarching law for medical emergencies like this, many States are caught off guard. And the response has been piecemeal.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/battling-covid-19-with-a-colonial-era-law/article31195144.ece
303,2020/03/28,City’s homeless moved to Exhibition Grounds,"Food distribution by GHMC not adequate, they say

Close to a thousand homeless persons were packed off to the Nampally Exhibition Grounds by GHMC, where they are kept almost imprisoned and watched over by the police.

Hundreds of people, who could be seen napping close together and playing cards under the tin-roofed sheds inside the grounds, seemed like a consolidated picture of homelessness in the city. They all are from the streets of Nampally and surrounding localities, and majority of them survived by doing hotel and catering jobs before the lockdown.

A group of individuals, taking pity on the persons, began distributing food to them, and eventually goaded GHMC officials into shifting them to the grounds and providing them food and shelter under Annapurna scheme. “We were distributing cooked food initially, and I found there were a number of people who needed help. I spoke to GHMC officials and arranged for them to take shelter in the grounds,” said Harish Kumar Daga, a citizen activist and IT professional.

However, since being shifted, no food was being allowed from outside, and food distribution by GHMC is not sufficient, complain the homeless. “Many of us used to work for hotels or catering, and slept in the dormitories of lodges nearby by paying per night. Due to the lockdown, we lost our daily wages and came on the roads. Several concerned people took pity on us and started distributing food, which was fine. But after being shifted here, the food distributed by GHMC is hardly sufficient,” said Rajesh Shetty from Mangalore.

Diwakar Bhore from Bheed is stranded here owing to lockdown. “They should have announced the lockdown two days before. I went to the railway station only to find out that no trains were running,” he says.

Close to 150 people had to go hungry on Friday night, as the food brought in by GHMC was not enough, and they were not allowed to go out in search of food, he said.

“There is only one dysfunctional toilet, which hundreds of us have to use. We were told we will be provided with soaps and shampoos, but so far nothing has been distributed. However, medicines were given for our ailments,” said Srinivas Reddy from Ramagundam.

Besides, the much needed distancing in view of coronavirus spread in the city, is hardly being observed. People slept close to each other, and stood without an inch of separation in queues during food distribution.

‘No food shortage’

Zonal Commisisoner Praveenya Reddy said the initial plan was to house only about 300 persons at the grounds, which has later swollen as homeless from other zones too arrived.“We are planning to shift them to other places tomorrow, and keep only 150 persons there. There is no food scarcity. In fact, nutritious food of Annapurna scheme was thrown away by them today for reasons best known to them. NGOs are being restricted from bringing in food, as we felt they could serve other needy,” she said.

She also refuted the charge of scarcity of toilets, and said 20 toilets were available and being cleaned on regular basis. Police was posted only to stop new entrants and not to restrict anyone from going out, she added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/m36eyo/article31195127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29HOMELESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/citys-homeless-moved-to-exhibition-grounds/article31195128.ece
304,2020/03/28,DRDO suit ideal for COVID-19 warriors too,"The clothing was fabricated for medical, para-medics in the event of radiological emergencies

The Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences of the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) has announced that the protective clothing it had earlier developed for medical and para-medical staff in event of radiological emergencies, is also considered as an ideal full body suit to stop contamination through coronavirus.

The suit is washable and has passed all critical standards. It has been found to be suitable after being widely tested by the DRDO and other agencies. The defence research organisation has outsourced the manufacture to firms in Kolkata and Mumbai with a joint capacity of 10,000 suits a day, each costing about ₹7,000, informed an official spokesman.

These suits are intended for the front line medical respondents rushing to any incident site and those working for long hours in the hospitals. “The dry suit has now become a critical requirement for health and medical staff so that they are protected from any contact from the virus during their work,” he added.

It is among four items kept ready by the DRDO and its allied units following the outbreak of the COVID-19 in China three months ago under the theme ‘War Against Corona’.

The other items include indigenously developed hand sanitisers costing about ₹120 a litre already being supplied to the Delhi police and other Central government agencies, a multi-patient ventilator costing about ₹4 lakh is to be ready in few days and an advanced five layer/two layer masks, costing ₹70 a piece, are also being supplied to several agencies concerned, the spokesman added.

305,2020/03/28,Ex-servicemen exempted from taking referrals,"Eligible beneficiaries under Ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) have been exempted from obtaining referral from polyclinics and military hospital and allowed to go to any hospital in emergency in wake of COVID-19. The decision was taken to implement social distancing and avoid unnecessary exposure to others.

Reimbursement

ECHS polyclinics have taken a series of measures to help ex-servicemen, who throng the clinics on weekdays. A key concession given to ECHS members is the facility to buy medicines as prescribed by the polyclinics/empanelled hospitals from any medical shop or pharmacy and claim reimbursement for April this year. The earlier practice was to provide medicines free of cost to the card holders at the polyclinics. This has been done to prevent infections.

The officer in-charge of ECHS Golden Palm Sainik Bhavan at Secunderabad, in a statement, asked ex-servicemen and their dependants to avoid visiting the ECHS.

307,2020/03/28,Centre urged to allow transport of raw seed from other States,"Over 400 seed companies process and store seed in Telangana

The Telangana government has requested the Centre to permit the movement of raw (unprocessed) seed produced in different States to Hyderabad and other places in Telangana for their processing and storage and to make them available to the farming community across the country for the next kharif season.

In a letter addressed to Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Saturday, Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy explained that there were about 400 seed companies operating from Telangana and they have their processing plants and storage points here. Seed of various crops produced in the neighbouring as well as far-off States would start reaching Telangana from late-February every year.

Certification agency

However, in the wake of country-wide lockdown being implemented to prevent the spread of coronavirus the transport of raw seed has stopped. He further explained that apart from over 400 national and international private seed companies, the seed certification agency for export of seed to other countries under the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) programme was also based here.

Stating that Telananga State Seed and Organic Certification Authority (TSSOCA) was the nodal seed certification agency for the seed produced in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Puducherry and Lakshadweep besides Telangana, the Minister said the seed produced there would also come for certification in addition to the seed produced in other States for processing and storage by the national and international seed companies in Telangana.

The Minister requested the Union Minister to permit the transport of seed produced in other States reach Telangana for their processing and storage since the seed companies located here would meet the country’s nearly 70% of seed needs besides exports under the OECD programme. He stated that the seed companies would get the raw seed produced by their contracted farmers in Telangana, AP, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and other States.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/59av3z/article31194770.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29SEED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/centre-urged-to-allow-transport-of-raw-seed-from-other-states/article31194668.ece
308,2020/03/28,"DLSA provides food, transport for migrant labourers","They were walking all the way from Hyderabad to reach their native places in Narayanakhed, Nizamabad and Maharashtra

Moved by the plight of hundreds of people, including children and the elderly, who were going by walk from Hyderabad to their native places at Narayanakhed, Nizamabad and Maharashtra, the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) stepped in and came to their rescue.

On Saturday, those coming by walk from Hyderabad to reach different destinations within and beyond the district were taken to the District Court premises. There they were asked to assemble in a specified place. After sometime they were given food by District Principal and Sessions Judge K. Sai Rama Devi along with DSP P. Sridhar Reddy.

About 100 people reached Sangareddy on Saturday. Many of them started walking at 3 a.m. and walked for about 50 km. There were children and aged who could not walk. The police who were on patrol on the road directed them to the court where they were asked to take rest for some time and later offered food.

After that Justice Rama Devi interacted with them and asked why they were returning. They informed the Judge that they were working as daily wage labourers and returning to native places as there was no work. “We will be safe and secure if we reach our native place,” they told her.

“I had read in The Hindu about the fate of people who are walking all the way from Hyderabad and their problems. One of our staff also informed me about a family that came in contact with them and were given food and footwear. To do our bit to the society, the issue was taken to the notice of State Legal Service Authority (SLSA) on Friday and we sent a proposal for supplying food to the needy. Justice M.S. Ramachandar Rao, SLSA, has allowed to do the service. Hence we have started distributing food.

309,2020/03/28,Tamil folk and classical art forms unite to fight Coronavirus in this music video,"Titled ‘United to Heal: Coronavai Jeyippom’, the video features parai attam, silambattam, gaana, folk dance and Bharatanatyam in a bid to show that unity is key in the time of crisis

To the backdrop of a peppy mridangam bit that eventually joins the foot-tapping beats of parai, a couple of Bharatanatyam dancers alternate their vivacious movements with others. In the interludes, a woman wielding a silambam replete with colourful ribbons tied at the ends, takes over as the music continues unabated.

The frame is nothing short of a celebration — the wide smiles that the performers don only confirm this. In the past few weeks, the digital space has had no dearth of creative outputs that are in some way or the other related to the Coronavirus pandemic.

The latest to join the bandwagon is the music video ‘United to Heal: Coronavai Jeyippom’, brought out by Chennai UCCN and Aanmajothi: an artistic collaboration featuring different performing art forms of Tamil Nadu in a bid to show that unity is key, especially now more than ever.

Written and sung by gaana/folk singer, Guru Aiyadurai, the song (in Tamil) packed with groovy moments, rightly shuttles between being informative and optimistic. In fact, the opening line translates to, “Our country will continue to prosper; and will wipe out the dreaded disease...” as Guru takes centre stage to spread hope and cheer, while sporting a smile and equipped with a laudable sense of rhythm.

The video, which was put together in a couple of days before the lockdown was enforced, has been widely shared since. And it is not just the lyrics that address the crisis at hand, the Bharatanatyam dancers have even devised a few poses and subtle gestures that demonstrate how one should wash one’s hand and cover one’s mouth while coughing. This particular scene appears as a refrain.

“We thought it would be interesting to integrate different forms rather than sticking to one that is within our comfort zone. This is kind of how the idea came about,” says a representative of Chennai UCCN who was involved in the production.

Guru was more than happy to hop on. Though he wrote the lyrics, there was a lot of back and forth within the crew to keep the overall idea positive. “We didn’t want to make it a public service announcement but wanted it to be uplifting and fun for the listeners,” says the representative, noting that all artistes practised at their own homes and spaces to the recorded song. “We knew we had very little time and didn’t have the luxury of coming together to practise. We only got together twice: to write the song and record it,” she says.

Over the process of putting it together, Shreya adds, gaana seemed to be “the perfect medium”, parai the perfect instrument, and Bharatanatyam the perfect movement form to tell this particular story. The title too was very important because the primary aim of the video is to be motivational: “We wanted to keep an eye on the future. Hence the jeyippom,” she says.

The video, which already has subtitles in English, is also being subtitled into Hindi, Spanish and French at the time of writing. In terms of response they have been receiving, the representative continues, “The mood dramatically changed when the lockdown was announced, and many of the responses that we got were positive, especially then.”

310,2020/03/28,Live ‘mehfils’ to beat COVID-19 lockdown blues,"Hyderabad-based Hindustani classical vocalist Harini Rao shares her experience of a live digital concert

Hindustani classical singer Harini Rao did something for the first time, on Friday evening. She sang live for an hour-long concert that was streamed via the Hindustani Classical Music and Everything (HCMAE) Facebook page.

The HCMAE has been hosting live concerts, inviting Hindustani classical musicians across the country to participate in their digital initiative of live mehfils, beginning March 20, as the nation prepared for the Janata Curfew and eventually the 21-day lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.

HCMAE has been promoting Hindustani classical music through its Facebook and Instagram accounts and had asked musicians to register for the live mehfils by sending them a detailed profile of their musical qualifications, achievements, and a link to their previous Hindustani classical music performances.

The forum has been hosting two or three hour-long live performances each day. While vocalists are requested to sing raag based khyal, madhyalay bandish or one semi-classical music item such as thumri, hori, bhajan, natyageet, Rabindra Sangeet or ghazal, instrumentalists can choose a raag and play aalap, jod, jhaala and gats with or without accompanists.

So far, the performers have tried to have a baithak setting from their homes. “It wasn’t tough,” says Harini, about creating a baithak experience from home: “We tested the light, angle and sound prior to the concert.”

What made Harini a tad nervous was the loyal audience the HCMAE live mehfils attracts. “Their Facebook page has a huge audience and a good number of active viewers, so I was a bit nervous during the concert,” she says and explains that at a real concert, the audience cheers and claps, is usually courteous and doesn’t boo the stage performer. However, in digital platforms, there’s scope for viewers to instantly send their reactions and comments.

Harini concedes that while performing, it took a little more focus to not be tempted to read the comments and focus solely on the singing. “Luckily, it was an encouraging audience and there were no negative comments; I received a few requests [for songs],” she says.

She used the electronic tabla and tampura to accompany her vocal presentation, in the absence of real accompanists. The iTablaPro has been her go-to app for riyaaz and it came in handy for the live concert. “A lot of musicians use the app for practice sessions, since accompanying artists can’t always come home,” she explains.

Performing for an hour through a digital screen where the focus remains solely on the artiste can be daunting and at the same time exciting. Harini says she was keen to use every minute of the allotted time to present a range of compositions. The live concert was also a welcome break during lockdown and Harini had around 2400 viewers in all, and at least 200 active listeners at any given time.

311,2020/03/28,The superhero who stayed home,"Youtube sensation Bhuvan Bam’s ‘Time to Be Hero-But From Home’ debunks fake Whatsapp forwards on COVID-19 and highlights the precautions you should take

Delhi-based comedian, singer/songwriter Bhuvan Bam, whose YouTube channel BB Ki Vines has over 16 million subscribers, has done his bit to correct misconceptions on how to deal with the COVID-19 scare. Fake forwards abound on Whatsapp, causing panic and confusion, and it is that Bhuvan addresses in his video: ‘Time to Be A Hero, But From Home’.

In quintessential BB ki Vines style (the Youtube channel, started in 2015, is about an Indian middle-class boy BB and some funny instances happening with him and his family), Bhuvan has created a video that every Indian family can relate to, making the content easy to understand. The video deals with topics such as ‘whatsapp broadcasts’, ‘social distancing’, ‘to not be a hoarder’, ‘the proper hand washing techniques’ and ‘how the elderly are more susceptible. Titled ‘Time to Be a Hero-But from home’, the video has clocked almost nine million views and is trending on YouTube.

“In my own family, the primary source of information is Whatsapp. My parents believe in the forwards in whatsapp groups and they expect me to follow what they say. And so I wondered that if this is the case in my family then it must be happening with other families too. So I started reading up about how COVID-19 is actually affecting people. One of the most important things to do is to stay at home. I realised that first of all a person needs to be serious about it. We are in a time when the meme culture prevails, everything is a joke. To find humour in everything is fun and that’s how life should be. But people are still not realizing the gravity of the situation.

312,2020/03/28,What radio channels have lined up to keep boredom at bay,"From Akashvani’s Rainbow to Fever and Big FM, most radio channels have created a mix of programmes — from airing classic movies and playing timeless music to experts answering COVID-19 related queries

Sound of music

More than six weeks ago, Akashavani Bengaluru started planning an Ugadi special. When N Raghu, Assistant Director of Programmes, started planning jugalbandis for Ugadi Chaitra Sangeeta, little did AIR authorities know that their Ugadi specials would have so many listeners. “We decided to make it a jugalbandi special till March 31. We have interesting duos on our medium wave primary 100.1 FM channel on Amrutavarshini at 8.30 am and 7 pm every day,” says Raghu.

On March 28 there would be Shubha Santhosh on veena and Prabhir Bhattacharya on sitar. On March 29 Amit Nadig (flute) and Jayanth K Das on sitar will perform. Pushpa Kashinath on veena with Ranjan Beura on violin will perform on March 30 and on March 31 Vani Manjunath on flute will play with Prakash Sontakke on slide guitar.

Raghu says Akashavani on 101.3 FM Rainbow channel has a slew of interactive programmes regarding COVID-19. “Opinions will be shared from the medical community and doctors will address doubts. Mind games and quizzes will offer much-needed relief.”

Songs and laughs

Sahana Shivanna, Programming Head –Bangalore of 92.7 Big FM says, “We play timeless music. And like most radio channels, programmes are repeated during different times of the day for everyone to catch up. We have never compromised on informing and entertaining our listeners.”

Big FM has Pataki Mornings with Shruthi and Full Time Pass with Pradeepa. “Shruthi gives daily updates on COVID-19 and warns against fake news. She speaks to experts from different fields to motivate people. She also does Facebook live interactions to make people realise the importance of staying home.”

The evenings has Pradeepa making people laugh. “Pradeep often goes live on Instagram with Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao. He also speaks to health officers, doctors and psychiatrists.”

Educate and entertain

The radio industry has been entrusted with the responsibility of reaching out to people with authentic information, says Harshad Jain, CEO – Radio and Entertainment, HT Media that has FEVER FM, Radio Nasha and Radio One under its umbrella. “We are proud to be part of Radio4India initiative for this fight against COVID-19,” he says.

The core need for radio is not only to inform, educate and create awareness but also to entertain, engage and be a companion to people at home, says Jain. The channel’s large scale initiatives, expert opinions, relevant updates and entertainment segments on air “are to keep people company.”

FEVER FM, Radio Nasha and Radio One network’s RJ curfew initiative to support the recent Janata Curfew came in for a lot of praise, says Jain. The radio network is now asking listeners to pick up a new skill/passion during lockdown in the Kuch Naya Karona segment. Radio Nasha’s Nasha Talkies where all-time classics such as Sholay, Satte pe Satta, Munnabhai MBBS are aired on radio is another initiative to keep boredom at bay.

Spiritual leaders such as Sadhguru and Sri M are giving motivational speeches on FEVER. “We play Antakshri with listeners, getting them to play from home and connecting with people who might be stranded elsewhere with their families,” says Jain.

Concert from home

Radio City has introduced Concert from Home where singers will perform, while City Cinema, where popular Kannada movies are played in the afternoon will continue. “Every week Radio City Bangalore explores something new while emphasising the basics such as stay indoors and social distancing,” says Kartik Kalla, Chief Creative Officer, Radio City.

“Radio City ka salaam, Corona fighters ke naam salutes the efforts of doctors, nurses, policemen and airport authorities. In Bangalore our RJs are connecting with Kannadigas across the globe including Doha, Shanghai, Netherlands, Germany and USA. Celebrities are coming on board to speak about the importance of personal hygiene,” says Kalla.

Time to get inspirational

Ajaneesh Lokanath who scored music for Avane Srimannarayana and Ulidavaru Kandante, will trace his journey on Mirchi Bangalore. “COVID-19 may be keeping people indoors, but these are times when inspirational talks will make a deep impact on people,” says Vivek R, Programmng Head, 98.3 Mirchi Bangalore.

The Corona Jagriti capsules connect affected people, their friends and relatives from Netherlands, Spain and the US. “While we have concerts and indoor games on social media with prizes for winners, many programmes are informative bringing data on previous health pandemics and wars that created havoc for humanity,” says Vivek.

Glamour comes in the Hot Star segments with Manvitha Harish (of Tagaru fame) and Sonu Gowda (who was a hit in Inti Ninna Preetiya) showing you how to kill time at home. “Chaitra Vasudevan from the recently concluded Big Boss will be another guest,” says Vivek",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/m7w3ra/article31191550.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Screenshot20200328-12542301,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/tune-in-to-radio-channels-to-keep-boredom-at-bay/article31191551.ece
313,2020/03/28,‘Chetuletti mokkuta’: Band ChowRaasta releases new Coronavirus song,"Through a new Telugu song, Ram Miriyala of ‘ChowRaasta’ pleads, begs and appeals to people to stay indoors during the Coronavirus lockdown

In times of Coronavirus, music is an obvious relief and a tool to inspire. Here comes Chetuletti mokkuta, a Telugu song by Ram Miriyala of band ChowRaasta urging people to be responsible and stay indoors and practice physical distancing. The song begins with simple yet compelling words — Chetuletti mokkuta cheyi cheyi kalapaku ra, kaalu kooda mokkuta adugu bayataku pettakura, unna kaade undara, ganji taagi pandara, manchi rojulocche daaka, nimmalanga undara.

The song released recently has garnered more than 18,000 views and gives staying indoors a new vocabulary. “Being an artiste, it is my responsibility to respond to the situation. We are confined indoors but we can still do our bit,” says the singer-lyricist and composer.

A screenshot of the song

The song took shape a few days ago when Ram began scribbling, and he says the word flow was quick and he completed the song in a span of four hours. Released on YouTube, the visuals are a series of photographs and the catchy lyrics in local dialect instantly drew attention. “I was emotional and aggressive while I was writing. I was also disappointed to see some people out on the roads. It made me wonder if they have understood the severity of the situation, or they do not have the right information.”

He also reaches out to the large section of people locked in their homes who might be suffering from isolation blues. He tackles different issues — from asking people to not go out for silly reasons to urging them to be responsible and practice physical distancing. “I want to share that the disease is not going to end with one infected person; when he doesn’t practice physical distancing, there are possibilities of infecting many.”

Speaking about people helping us in this crisis, he says, “We have so many comforts staying at home. When we venture out, we add burden to doctors, health workers, police personnel and media working for us. In the lines, ‘Lokamante veru kaadu nuvve a lokam ra’, I want to tell people that society is not different, we make the society.”

He considers himself as a peoples’ singer responding to farmers’ struggle and social issues around him. During his stage performances, he sings with a red towel wrapped around his neck. “The red towel is to say I sing only for people,” he says.

In fact, his unreleased song is on togetherness urging people to hug and leave all discrimination in their lives. “My focus is on ‘Aalai Balai’, an exchange of greetings in Telangana. The song is ready now but I now cannot release as the situation is completely different now. With Coronavirus, I cannot ask people to go and hug each other,” he says on a light-hearted note.

314,2020/03/28,An annual series of concerts in Hyderabad went digital prior to lockdown,"Hyderabad’s Sangeetha Ksheera Sagaram live streamed its concerts days before the lockdown following the outbreak of COVID-19

In what was the last leg of classical concerts held in Hyderabad prior to the Coronavirus scare, Sangeetha Ksheera Sagaram’s expansive line-up of artists for their annual music series held at Saptaparni didn’t go unnoticed by connoisseurs. The latter half of the concert series had yet again provided a major impetus for the instrumentalists besides comprising a vocal performance as well.

Tirupati-based flautist Manda Anantha Krishna brought forward a sense of elegance and flavour to his presentation in a concert where he was supported by his student V Lakshmi. Among a few instrumentalists whose method isn’t completely reliant on bringing out the beauty of the raga alone, his terrific understanding of sahitya bhava has always enriched the listener experience.

Balamuralikrishna’s rivetingly paced varnam in Gambheeranata ragam, Amma Ananda Dayini provided an electrifying start to the proceedings. The beauty of the composition was brought out well with the seamless tonal shift to Shive Shive Varala Rasive and the return to the pallavi segment. The ability of the Shanmukhapriya ragam to dig into the deepest corners of the human core came through in the intense rendition of Mutthaiah Bhagavatar’s Valli Nayaka.

Little needs to be said about how soul-warming can the Thyagaraja Pancharatna kriti Sadhinchene be on the flute, where the musician had explored the Arabhi ragam in its complete glory handling its complex swara phrases with grace. Anantha Krishna had later moved onto Ramaswamy Shivan’s Neekela Dayaradu and tapped the enquiring-nature of its lyric through the Sarasangi ragam, during which his neraval at the pallavi also impressed.

Sogasugaa Mridanga Talamu’s presence at the concert was significant, given it is among a handful of kritis that discusses the deep connection between classical music and spirituality. His elaborate ragalapana in Sri Ranjani leading to the kriti set the tone for the performance well, while the brisk swarakalpana and neraval consolidated on a good start. His best yet reflected in O Ranga Sai, conventionally a vocalist’s favourite for the main item, where he chose Bhuloka Vaikuntam for the neraval and swarakalpana. The upbeat mridangam artiste Karra Srinivas and T P Balasubramanyam’s measured performance on the ghatam complemented the flautist well.

The accompanists (also including violinist Oruganti Rajasekhar) and Anantha Krishna rose to the occasion with Balamuralikrishna’s Gathibhedapriya tillana, with all of its stanzas set to different ragas and gathis. The coordination across five ragas and gathis could have been tricky yes, but the unified rendition cleared all suspicion in the mind of a rasika.

A memorable duet

Vocal duets are a challenge in terms of coordination, but they give the vocalists a chance to capitalise on their strengths, unlike the solos where the responsibility of shouldering the concert alone can occasionally become a burden for the musician too. Jyothi Vaidyanathan and Jayanthi Vaidyanathan, better known as Vyjayanthi sisters, have a great musical legacy being the granddaughters of renowned musician Balasubramania Bhagavathar. With similar shruti and varied vocal range, their synchronisation was a musical delight.

The all-women concert where the vocalists were accompanied by Radhika Srinivasan on violin, Veenadhari on mridangam and Radha Gopi was rich in lyrical diversity, featuring the works of Thyagaraja, Swathi Tirunal, Patnam Subramanya Iyer, Oothukadu Venkatasubbaiyer, Dikshitar, Tukaram. The vocalists were terrific with their ragalapanas, be it Purvikalyani (for Deva Deva Jagadeswara), Saranga (Entha Bhagyamu) or the main item Kamalambam Bhajare in Kalyani ragam. The rendition of complicated swara phrases at a breath-taking pace with Vararagalaya in rarely explored ragam like Chenchu Kambhoji was arresting. Tukaram’s abhang Tujhe Naam elicited the piousness in the poet’s writing.

With a fusion twist

Cultural critic and musician Jaywant Naidu, the well-known Hawaiian guitarist in Hyderabad, gave most of his raga delineations a fusion touch in his solo concert. His performance was predominantly set on a Hindustani music base, with a mild Western music undertone, occasionally enriched by the Carnatic touches too. It’s sometimes liberating when the musicians don’t restrict the scope of a raga to a certain kriti or a composition. It was this facet that made Jaywant’s concert reach out to a wider audience, it allowed the audience to experience pure music without trying to overwhelm them.

Jaywant chose the fundamental raga to every Hindustani music learner, raag Yaman to begin the concert. A soothing alaap paved way to a pleasing jod with a captivating rhythm, while he gradually proceeded from the vilambit to the drut teen taal. While he had consistently taken an alaap-jod pattern to bring out the flavour of other raags too like Jog and Malkauns, he experimented with the madhyalay teen taal too with impressive proficiency. The familiarity he struck with the audiences with a brief exploration of Kondalalo Nelakonna during the Malkauns delineation was timely.

The lightness of the dhun in the concert in raag Mishrakamaj was a welcome break from the intense renditions. Considering a request, the musician played Vatapi Ganapathim Bhaje on the instrument later, while the Carnatic music streaks brought a delightful closure to the music series with a gath set to Addha teen taal in raag Sindhu Bhairavi. Tabla players Sawan Kakkeri and Amit Bhushan with their rhythm and refined understanding of the taal patterns struck a chord with their on-stage camaraderie.

315,2020/03/28,Coronavirus | Kerala registers first COVID-19 death,"The 69-year-old man had a history of heart disease, says authorities.

A 69-year-old man who was admitted to the COVID-19 care centre in Ernakulam died at 8 a.m. on March 28. He is Kerala's first COVID-19 victim.

The man, who had returned from Dubai, was admitted to Ernakulam Medical College Hospital with pneumonia on March 22, said the authorities in a statement.

He had a history of heart disease and high blood pressure, it said. As his condition worsened, he was put on ventilator, said Dr. Fathahudeen, the nodal officer for COVID-19 treatment in Ernakulam.

The deceased was a resident of Chullikkal near Fort Kochi in Ernakulam.

The 69-year-old hadn’t shown any symptoms on arrival from Dubai on March 17, but was asked to quarantine himself.

However, his wife and the online taxi driver who ferried him from the airport also tested positive for the virus. Following this, 10 families in the apartment complex at Panayappilly, near Fort Kochi, where he was residing were also quarantined.

316,2020/03/28,Police reach out to destitute,"Kalamassery police also take up drive to feed stray dogs

The Kerala Police are keeping watch over the destitute left on the streets without a home to go back to.

The campaign, #FeedAStomach, is an extension of the police’s larger #BreakTheChain campaign. It is being implemented in association with a slew of other initiatives and organisations, including Nanma Foundation, Mission Better Tomorrow, Our Responsibility to Children, and Student Police Cadets.

“The project, which was launched on Wednesday, is now under way at Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi, where more than 1,000 food packets are being distributed daily. We are looking at ways to extend the programme to other districts. The idea is to reach out to all in need so that no one goes hungry during this difficult time,” said P. Vijayan, Inspector General of Police who is spearheading the campaign.

Meanwhile, the Kalamasserry Janamaithri Police are also set to feed stray dogs in the city.

The police have bought over 25 kg of dog food, which they will start distributing from Saturday. The Chief Minister, in his daily press briefing on Friday, also exhorted the police to feed stray animals.

“Stray dogs turn really aggressive when they are hungry. So it is high time that we fed them since they might have gone a few days without enough food,” said P.S. Reghu, a civil police officer who came up with the idea.

The Kalamasserry police, who started with feeding just over 100 people at the start of the lockdown, have more than doubled that number since then. They have also been feeding inmates stranded in hostels without food.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/police-reach-out-to-destitute/article31187817.ece
317,2020/03/28,An eye in the sky to nab those violating lockdown,"Police deploy drone for surveillance

People trying to violate the lockdown or quarantine protocol under the cover of darkness may now be in for a rude shock. For, an “eye in the sky” will be watching over them, and they could end up with cases registered against them for violating norms.

The City police on Friday deployed a drone to assist them with surveillance for more effective enforcement of the lockdown.

“We were allocated a drone from the police headquarters a month ago, which is now being used for the enforcement of the lockdown. Similarly, drones were allocated to Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur and Kannur districts as well,” said G. Poonguzhali, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order), Kochi City police.

The drone was deployed from Marine Drive ground in the evening. Fitted with night vision camera, the drone will be able to carry out surveillance during early morning and night hours.

“It has come to our notice that people are roaming outside their homes or relaxing in open spaces at nightfall. Besides, people are also engaging in morning walks. We hope to detect these violations using the drone,” said Ms. Poonguzhali.

A control room has been set up for coordinating the operation of the drone by officers equipped with wireless handsets. So, when a violation is detected by the drone, the control room will alert the local police stations concerned.

The drone is capable of making a sortie for 40 minutes at a stretch with its surveillance radius stretching around two kilometres from the ground. “We are also planning targeted operation of the drone in areas with quarantined people so that we will be able to monitor whether they are complying with the protocol,” said Ms. Poonguzhali.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/an-eye-in-the-sky-to-nab-those-violating-lockdown/article31187792.ece
318,2020/03/28,Community kitchens feed the needy in crisis time,"79 outlets opened under panchayats; migrant workers avail service

Seventy-nine community kitchens have started functioning under 82 panchayats in Ernakulam district.

The community kitchens were launched to provide food to those in need as part of the State government’s directive to ensure that nobody remained without food amid the lockdown. Those who are in home quarantine, those unable to cook because they stay alone in lodges or have no essentials, the elderly and the indigent, destitute people, bedridden patients, and those who seek alms will be provided food from the community kitchens.

Some local bodies have set up more than one kitchen to meet the requirement. Kunnukara panchayat with four kitchens has the highest number of community kitchens in the district. Steps have been taken to set up eight more such kitchens in Ernakulam.

Migrant workers were found availing the service more compared to those in home quarantine in the district, according to an official release.

The kitchens are being operated by the Department of Local Self Government in association with the Kudumbashree Mission. The kitchens have been set up at schools and auditoriums.

Kudumbashree Mission officials said free meals would be given to migrant workers, quarantined people and the unemployed, and the expenses would be reimbursed by the local bodies concerned.

Corporation kitchens

Meanwhile, District Collector S. Suhas issued a stringent directive to the Kochi Corporation on the civic body’s delay in opening community kitchens under its jurisdiction. Mayor Soumini Jain said five community kitchens were launched under five zones of the Corporation on Friday, and criticised the district administration for issuing such a directive without verifying facts.

Snehil Kumar Singh, Sub Collector and Incident Commander responsible for implementation of COVID-19 control activities, has asked the Corporation to shift nearly 500 homeless people living on the streets under the civic body’s jurisdiction to camps. An order was issued directing the Corporation Secretary to set up camps at SRV High School, Government Girl’s High School, and other safer locations.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/i8kxil/article31187783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28-KI-KITCHEN-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/community-kitchens-feed-the-needy-in-crisis-time/article31187785.ece

320,2020/03/28,No end to garbage collectors’ woes in Kochi,"They go from door to door, exposing themselves to danger in the process

While the rest of the city remains locked down amid COVID-19 fears, Rukmini P.U. steps out to work at 5 a.m., armed with gloves and a towel to keep her nose and mouth covered.

Whether some residents of the houses she collects waste from at Vennala may have returned from abroad or may possibly carry the infection, she does not know, she says. But she is certain that she cannot skip even a day’s work.

“If waste is not collected and piles up for days, that could lead to more diseases,” she says.

Her collection runs have become brisk lately. She heads out in a goods autorickshaw driven by her daughter. They do not stop to talk to anybody and try to avoid entering gates of houses.

They have asked residents to keep waste outside the previous night, she says, and they wash the vehicle thoroughly after they hand over waste to the Kochi Corporation’s truck that transports it to the dumpyard.

Each household pays her ₹150 to ₹200 per month for the job that has sustained her family of five for nearly 20 years. Her three children, husband, and grandchildren are all mostly dependant on her, she says.

More than the possibility of contracting the virus, Fasila Faisal, who collects waste from MG Road and Pallimukku areas, is worried that she might not be paid for a while. “Shops are mostly shut now. Each shop would pay between ₹250 and ₹400. If they are not open for some time, they may not pay,” she says. Most people who go door-to-door collecting waste are not salaried employees of the corporation and rely on whatever households were willing to pay, she points out. Some are either part of local self-help groups or have landed the job with the help of the local councillor.

Fasila has not been provided with gloves but has a towel to cover her nose and mouth. She returns home after the corporation truck picks up the waste any time between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m. to cook for her husband and three children, she adds.

Masks have recently been finding their way into trash along with other plastic waste, says Mohanan who collects waste from Kaloor on a tricycle. “Everything else aside, that could cause trouble for us,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/mllqft/article31187741.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PHOTO-2020-03-25-12-14-57,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/no-end-to-garbage-collectors-woes-in-kochi/article31187742.ece
321,2020/03/28,People’s Watch appreciates steps taken by administration,"‘More feeding centres must be opened for the needy’

Expressing gratitude for the efforts taken by the district administration to check spread of COVID-19, People’s Watch, a Madurai based non-governmental organisation, has urged the State to also look into other areas that need to be addressed.

In a letter written to the district administration, the Executive Director of People’s Watch, Henri Tiphagne, condemned the use of force by police on the public.

Complaining against the use of lathi, he asked if the police had conducted any meeting with local resident welfare associations, to assist them.

He urged senior police officials to instruct their subordinates against the use of lathi, which he said was being used for a wrong purpose. In these times, there must be a trust in democracy and democratic policing rather than colonial policing, he said.

Further, he said that people were unable to venture out to buy essential commodities, due to excessive questioning by the police. People need to have access to markets and police must only ensure that personal distancing was being adhered to.

He suggested that the timing of the markets could be regulated and an open ground could be used to put up such markets.

Volunteers could be engaged to ensure law and order and they could be given protective gear, like masks and sanitisers.

The poor in the city were unable to maintain personal distancing as they live in small cramped spaces.

Places to accommodate such people must be taken up as an urgent measure. Also in addition to the Amma Canteens, more feeding centres must be opened for the needy, he said.

There was a large number of homeless people and migrant labour who were dependant on such canteens. The feeding centres may be safely located in schools and teachers could be identified and entrusted with the duty to run the centres.

In this time of emergency, he urged hospitals, both government and private to cater to the needs of patients.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/peoples-watch-appreciates-steps-taken-by-administration/article31194372.ece
322,2020/03/28,"No hitch in procurement, distribution at Aavin","Thanking various stakeholders involved in milk procurement and production, the Aavin Madurai has been able to deliver milk through its 874 locations across the city and peripheries on time without encountering any major difficulties in this critical juncture, said its General Manager R. Janani Soundarya here on Saturday.

Speaking to The Hindu, the GM said that the State government had listed milk as one among the essential commodities for supply to the public. In a situation, where the COVID-19 pandemic has been threatening every segment of the society, Aavin has been standing at the forefront and ensuring that production and distribution go on smoothly.

Adhering to the guidelines of the Health Ministry, all workers and supervisors have been instructed to adopt personal distancing both inside the Aavin facility and in depots. At the production facility, disinfectant materials are sprayed twice a day. All the 150 vehicles, engaged in transport of milk, the staff and marketing teams have been sensitised to be clean. At the depots, public have been told to maintain a distance of three feet between one person and another while buying milk.

The workers handling milk sachets have been instructed to use soap oil and also wear face mask while interacting with consumers. There was no need for panic buying or hoarding as milk would be supplied through out the curfew period and the GM urged the people to cooperate with the depot staffs.

Reaching out to needy

Apart from attending to the call of duty, Aavin has decided to join hands in reaching out to the needy other than its consumers by supplying free milk, ghee and cookies to certain categories of people.

As part of relief measures, Aavin has identified certain categories to whom, they have decided to deliver their products free till curfew was lifted.

According to Aavin MD Vallalar, they have been distributing their milk and other allied products to the Blue Cross, to inaccessible community such as homes, which take care of special children and among others.

In Madurai, the M S Chellamuthu Trust and Research Centre, which runs special home in Othakadai, Alagar Kovil and a few other places, received milk from Aavin from Saturday.

According to Trust Director (programs) Babu, they have special children in the units for whom Aavin milk would be served. There were about 130 children, who attend the day-care school also, he noted.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/8lfchv/article31194364.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA29CITY-AAVIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/no-hitch-in-procurement-distribution-at-aavin/article31194365.ece
323,2020/03/28,Feeding animals in the time of COVID-19,"Volunteers offer bananas to monkeys at Tirupparankundram

At a time when the animals are left in lurch due to lack of access to food amidst the lockdown, volunteers of Oorvanam, a city-based youth voluntary group involved in rescue of animals, are demonstrating the right way to take care of them.

These volunteers are feeding and supplying water to the wild animals at the foothills of Tirupparankundram, in addition to nurturing the stray dogs.

For the last six years, the volunteers have been regularly filling up five cement tanks with water during summers to quench the thirst of the wild animals. But, this summer, the volunteers are also feeding bananas to the monkeys, which are predominantly found at the foothills. These animals were facing starvation as pilgrims were barred from entering the Subramanya Swamy Temple on top of the hill.

“The devotees used to feed them with fruits or food prepared from annadhanam (free food) prepared at the temple. But, since the lockdown, these animals were left starving,” says P. R. Viswanath, the head of the group.

He adds that there are no native trees in the foothills to satiate the hunger of the animals. “It is also important to feed these animals as otherwise these animals could enter the villages and it could lead to human-animal conflict,” he says.

As a precautionary measure to curb the spread of COVID-19, the volunteers are wearing face masks and hand gloves. C. Srinivasan, a volunteer, says that their team has worked during other natural calamities including the Vardah cyclone and Kerala floods.

Along with the animals, the volunteers also feed the abandoned elderly who are in distress due to the lockdown. P. Sagadevan, another volunteer says, that friends and philanthropists donate money and supply groceries to prepare food for the elderly.

For Mr. Viswanath, the current fight against COVID-19 brings back memories of the outbreak of parvovirus among dogs in the city last year. “Many puppies died last year because of parvovirus enteritis, a highly contagious disease.” “This current crisis shows how humans are part of this ecosystem where all animals also coexist,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/4902mg/article31194345.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA29MONKEYSMDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/feeding-animals-in-the-time-of-covid-19/article31194347.ece

A senior official from the District Supply Office said that in the wake of COVID-19, salesmen from various fair price shops will visit individual houses in their area and provide a token prescribing the date and time when individuals must line up to collect rations.

This is to avoid crowding of these shops.

The individuals must also maintain one meter or three feet distance from each other as a precautionary measure against COVID-19. The officer said that they were unclear about whether precautionary steps have been taken by salesmen who are to visit houses and distribute tokens.

Madurai Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan inspected the community kitchens in the city on Saturday, where food is prepared to feed the homeless people rescued by the civic body.

Since the abandoned elderly are a high-risk group in these times of COVID-19 pandemic, the civic body had rescued a total of 230 homeless from across the city.

328,2020/03/28,"Pulses, groceries from Virudhunagar to be moved","Virudhunagar

Traders of various essential commodities like pulses, edible oil, and grocery are gearing up to resume their supply after various districts in Tamil Nadu and neigbouring Kerala were fast running out of supply of food items.

Ever since the nation-wide lockdown started on March 24 midnight to prevent spreading of Corona virus, distribution of pulses from Virudhunagar district, which is the hub for the State, came to a grinding halt. Similarly, major edible oil suppliers are also in Virudhunagar district.

After complaints of pulses going out of stock in many places in the State, Minister for Dairy Development, K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji, on Saturday held meeting with representatives of pulses merchants in the district.

The merchants said that they had stopped distribution of pulses fearing stopping of vehicles at check-posts on district borders.

“They had a bitter experience of stoppage of a vehicle and hence suspended the distribution fearing financial loss if trucks get stranded elsewhere as each truck-load of pulses is worth several lakhs of rupees,” Collector R. Kannan said.

After the Minister assured them of proper passage at all check-posts, including in Kerala, they have agreed to move pulses immediately.

A total of 96 vehicle passes have been issued for moving pulses, edible oil, grocery and rice from various parts of Virudhunagar district, he added.

The administration has also warned the traders that they should not attempt to ferry people from one place to another in their cargo vehicles. “They have been allowed to return with some other essential commodity, but should not bring people,” the Collector said.

The Minister, during a review meeting on COVID-19 preventive measures here, has asked the officials to start disinfection activities in all the 450 village panchayats. He also appealed to the people to wash their hands at least 10 to 15 times a day as a precautionary measure.

Meanwhile, the Minister handed over consent letters to the Collector to allocate ₹ 25 lakh each from the MLA Local Area Fund from the MLAs of Sivakasi (Mr. Bhalaji), Sattur (M.S.R.

329,2020/03/28,"Public urged to remain vigil, cooperate with officials","‘They have to face challenges arising out of COVID-19’

THOOTHUKUDI

Declaring that the district had so far not reported any persons tested positive with symptoms of COVID-19, Collector Sandeep Nanduri, however, appealed to the public to remain vigil and cooperate with the officials in facing the challenges due to the pandemic.

Presiding over a meeting attended by senior officials from the Health, Corporation, Revenue and Food Safety departments and the representatives of wholesale merchants and retail traders here on Saturday, the Collector said that the State government had announced a number of measures to tackle the COVID-19 situation, including the 21-day curfew. For the benefit of the public and the merchants, big open space such as the old and new bus stands in the city have been identified for selling essential commodities. The public shall be permitted to buy the goods between 6.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. Similarly, make shift fish markets have been identified in Threspuram and Poovalrayapuram.

He appealed to the merchants to sell their produce only in designated locations and not in places as they wished. The objective of the make shift markets were to ensure that personal distancing was maintained by the people and also it would be effective to enforce laws in such a challenging situation, Mr. Sandeep Nanduri said and added that similar make shift markets were identified in smaller towns and municipalities in the district, where people can purchase. He wanted the people to stay indoors and avoid crowding anywhere for the next 15 to 21 days as a precaution.

He said that the district administration had made elaborate arrangements for patients visiting Government Hospital with any symptoms such as fever, cough or cold. Without delaying, people can visit the GH or the PHCs for diagnosis. Facilities were also available at Kovilpatti, Kayalpattinam, Tiruchendur as well. Select private hospitals were also told to keep beds and isolation wards with ventilator facilities in a ready mode.

With about 1500 foreign returnees in the district since March 1, the Corporation and Municipal authorities have been closely monitoring them, as they were instructed to remain in their dwellings. Hence, absolute cooperation from the citizens would help the government overcome the crisis, he noted and for identification, stickers have been pasted, while assured that their privacy would be maintained.

In homes, where senior citizens were living alone, they can take the assistance of the officials or the toll free number (1077) through which essential commodities would be arranged for delivery at their dwellings. Likewise, he wanted the wholesale merchants (who delivered goods at homes) and those operating takeaways to issue identity cards to their staffs.

For private vehicles, which wanted to transport essential commodities within the district, they shall contact the PA (General) to the Collector and obtain necessary certificate which alone would enable the police to clear the vehicles at the check posts. The idea was to curtail unnecessary movements from one point to another, Mr.Sandeep Nanduri said and urged the parents to educate their children not to venture out since the curfew was in force.

Corporation Commissioner V P Jeyaseelan, Additional Collector P Vishnu Chandran, Sub-Collector Simranjeeth Singh Kehlon, Food Safety Officer Dr Mariappan, City Health Officer Dr Arunkumar, DD (Agri Business Marketing) Shantirani, Executive Engineer Parthiban and Saravanan participated.

A total of 283 people who have been in touch with the family of the 54-year-old man who died of COVID-19 are under home quarantine after a contract tracing exercise. His 44-year-old wife and two sons aged 24 and 22 have also tested positive.

District Collector T. G. Vinay said that as the family had been in touch with friends, relatives and colleagues from work, all of them have been placed under home quarantine and health workers have been making visits to their houses to ensure that they are healthy.

“The wife and the two sons of the COVID-19 victim are asymptomatic and have currently been placed under isolation”, he said and added that others who have been in close contact with family - particularly those who visited the mosque which was frequented by the 54-year-old victim, have been asked to stay strictly indoors.

Prior to identifying the disease, the deceased had visited two clinics, a get-together function, a reception and a private hospital before being admitted at the Government Rajaji Hospital on Saturday.

“The wife of the deceased had not left the house. The sons had visited relatives, been to the funeral and had been in touch with their employees. We are ensuring that our ground-level health staff are overseeing their health status,” he said.

After interacting with the family, the Health department and the Corporation have begun working on a micro plan to monitor areas where the spread could have taken place. The Collector said that they are currently dividing streets into sectors to ensure that either an anganwadi worker, a Village Health Nurse or a trained Red Cross volunteer checks in on those who are home quarantined.

Although they are monitoring, he said that the 283 persons were not being tested although World Health Organisation (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has recommended expanding the testing.

A person who has been home quarantined as he was a regular visitor to the mosque frequented by the deceased, said that he will be able to manage for the next three days without groceries but will have to step out soon to restock. “We are still unclear about who we should approach to shop.

In a shocking incident, a 90-year-old woman died after she was allegedly bitten on her neck by a 32-year-old man, who was reportedly kept in ‘home quarantine’ since he had returned here from Sri Lanka recently.

Police said that the man, who was in his residence under quarantine as mandated by the government to contain the COVID-19, suddenly ran naked on the streets on Friday evening. Even as a few neighbours watched the incident with shock, the man stopped in front of a dwelling, where an aged woman identified as Nachiammal was sleeping. The man bit the woman around her neck.

On hearing her scream, the passersby forcibly pulled the man and gave some relief to the old woman. The ‘108’ emergency ambulance service rushed the injured woman to hospital, while the villagers held back the man and handed him over to the police.

Though the doctors at the Theni Government Medical College Hospital gave treatment, the aged woman died on Saturday, police said.

Preliminary inquiries suggested that the man who had bitten the aged woman may be in depression and required counselling from a medical professional. A case of murder has been registered.

332,2020/03/28,Jawans follow strict discipline,"Go out of campus only on duty, strictly maintain cleanliness

MADURAI

With the nationwide lockdown in effect till April 14 to contain the spread of COVID-19, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) jawans deployed in Madurai have been following a strict regimen in their camp here, as per the guidelines issued by the Centre.

Restriction has been imposed on entry to the High Court campus for three weeks. The usually large number of jawans deployed at the High Court Bench premises has been reduced to minimum. A new three-shift rotation is being followed now.

“We have asked the jawans deployed in Madurai to strictly remain in the camp. They are allowed to go out only to discharge their duty or when they need to buy any essential commodity,” CISF sources said. No leave had been granted to anyone stationed here. However, the period of leave for those who had already gone on leave had been extended so that they could stay safe at home, they added.

The jawans had been instructed to maintain personal distancing. Use of hand sanitisers and hand wash liquids had been made mandatory. Surgical masks and gloves had also been procured for their use. Even when the High Court was functioning normally, the jawans wore masks and used sanitisers on visitors, the sources said.

Sources said that disinfectants were used on fitness and training equipment at the camp. “Jawans take turns and work out in small numbers. After one batch uses the equipment, the disinfectants are used. They are also kept under the sunlight,” the sources said.

During dining, a strict schedule was followed and the jawans ate in batches. Weapons were thoroughly cleaned before they were returned to the armoury, sources added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/jawans-follow-strict-discipline/article31193235.ece
333,2020/03/28,Madurai head constable donates 15 days salary for treatment of COVID-19 patients,"The constable said it was his duty to help people in this time of crisis

Head Constable B. Keerthi Sabarinathan (40), has donated his salary of 15 days, ₹23,160, for the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund towards providing treatment for COVID-19 patients.

In a letter to the Commissioner of Police, Madurai City, the head constable, attached to the Social Justice and Human Rights Wing, on Friday, said that the 15-day amount could be deducted from his salary and sent to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.

The Head Constable says that it was his duty to help the people who are in a dire situation at present. “The government is straining every nerve to prevent the spreading of the virus. On one hand the government is spending huge amounts to contain the virus and treat patients. On the other hand, its revenue has fallen drastically with people confined to houses,” he said.

Citizens of the State had always come forward to help the people in distress in the past during various cyclones and floods. “Hundreds of youth came out and gave their physical labour and also distributed several household items and food packets among the needy during the floods. But, this time the challenge is different. The best thing that people can do is to keep indoors. At this point time, I thought I should make my small contribution to the government to safeguard the people,” he said.

Stating that he has been living in a joint family, comprising his father, a retired Sub-Inspector of Police, his mother, his family and his younger brother’s family, Mr. Sabarinathan said that ₹23,160 would not pinch him much as he did not have to pay school fees immediately.

He hoped that his contribution would inspire a lot of philanthropists to shore up financial support for the State in its most crucial hour

Amidst wide-spread complaints of police excesses on people coming out to buy essential items under the lockdown period, this policeman has shown the kindness of the police force that is often seen as “ very tough”.

The residents of Maruthupandian Street in Melamadai (ward 30) have complained that due to a faulty underground drainage system, sewage has been seeping into their houses for the past one week.

This street is located close to Nellai Street, where a 54-year-old man, who tested positive for COVID-19, died recently. The residents have asked the authorities to immediately clear the blockage in the underground drainage line to ensure hygiene at their locality.

Following incidents of COVID-19 positive cases being reported in this area, both the streets have been sealed and movement of the residents has also been restricted. Currently, conservancy workers of Madurai Corporation with all necessary safety gear spray disinfectants and collect garbage from households regularly.

R. Yatish, a resident, said that human waste has been oozing into their toilets, causing harm to the residents. “All of us are already anxious as COVID-19 positive cases were reported in our area. I have a two-year-old son and I am worried that this unhygienic condition may further worsen the situation,” he said.

The problem can be addressed if the 15 drainage chambers in the street are cleared using sucker machines, said A. Jayakumar, a resident and former councillor. “These pipelines were laid under the ‘Namakku Namey’ scheme in an unplanned manner. Hence, they have to be cleared once every year. Though we repeatedly complained to the officials, no action has been taken yet,” he said.

A Corporation official said that this was one of the locations chosen for laying new underground drainage pipelines under the Smart Cities Mission. “We are working on war-footing to address any complaint from residents. This issue was not brought to our notice. But, we will enquire and take steps at the earliest,” the official said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/27uiyw/article31190808.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28MARTH-Sewagejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/faulty-drainage-system-worries-residents-of-madurais-maruthupandian-street/article31190809.ece

Dakshina Kannada observed a complete lockdown on Saturday with the district administration withdrawing permission given for the sale and purchase of essential commodities from 6 a.m. to noon, after two new positive cases were reported in the district on Friday.

Some milk booths in the city and other towns in the district sold packets for some time early in the morning. Later they closed down.

Hence, milk vans of Dakshina Kannada Cooperative Milk Union Ltd. (DKMUL) had to return from many towns in the district and places in the city to its dairy in Kulashekara in the city.

All vegetable and grocery shops, which otherwise operated from 6 a.m. to noon, remained closed. The main central market in the city wore a deserted look.

A meeting, chaired by Kota Srinivasa Poojary and attended, among others, by Nalin Kumar Kateel, MP and MLAs, decided late on Friday to impose a complete lockdown across Dakshina Kannada citing a spurt in COVID-19 cases in neighbouring Kasaragod and also in Dakshina Kannada on Friday.

Since the communication on the complete lockdown to the media came late there was no clarity whether medical shops, banks and milk booths would be allowed to function.

The district administration did not clarify on the same till late in the night. Hence, some medical shops did not open on Saturday.

Raviraj Hegde, president, DKMUL, said that despite showing identity cards several milk vendors were not allowed to open their shops by police across the district.

In some places police asked them not to open their outlets on Sunday too. Hence, 1.8 lakh litres of milk were returned to the dairy.

Infosys Foundation sent critical medical supplies worth ₹28 lakh to Dakshina Kannada to tackle COVID-19, according to P.S. Harsha, Police Commissioner, Mangaluru.

339,2020/03/28,COVID-19 | Discoms get 3 months for payment to gencos to ensure 24X7 power supply,"For ensuring uninterrupted power supply, the Power Ministry has also announced that payment security will be reduced by 50%.

The Central government on Saturday announced a slew of relief measures, including three-month moratorium for distribution companies (discoms) to pay to power generation companies (gencos), to ensure 24X7 electricity supply during the COVID-19 lockdown period.

From last August, the goverment had made it mandatory for discoms to issue a Letter of Credit to get power supply from gencos. Besides, discoms were given an option to get power supply on single day advanced payment.

This was done in view of the mounting outstanding dues of discoms towards gencos.

For ensuring uninterrupted power supply, the Power Ministry has also announced that payment security will be reduced by 50%.

According to a statement by the Ministry, directions are issued to power regulator CERC to provide three-month moratorium to discoms to make payment to gencos (generating companies) and transmission utilities. Also, there will be no penalty on late payment.

In addition, States are requested to issue similar directions to SERCs ( State Electricity Regulatory Commissions) .

Despite the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19, the whole workforce of the power sector — generation, transmission, distribution and system operations — is working round the clock, Power Minister R.K. Singh said in the statement.

In order to maintain the continuity of supply of coal by domestic coal companies and transportation by railways, the Ministry is in touch with the ministries concerned.

Due to the lockdown, consumers are unable to pay their dues to discoms.

This has affected the liquidity position of discoms, thereby impairing their ability to pay to the generating and transmission companies.

In this context, Mr. Singh has approved significant relief measures for the power sector.

CPSU Generation / Transmission Companies will continue supply/ transmission of electricity even to discoms which have large outstanding dues.

Industry body Nasscom has urged the government to suspend all deadlines, including for tax payment and return filing, until four weeks post lifting of the lockdown to provide relief to startups and SMEs.

To contain the spread of COVID-19, the government has announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown starting March 26.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has caused high stress on startups, putting their continuity at risk. They are looking to government to provide support and relief...” Nasscom said in a statement.

The industry body said startups are facing severe time loss and project delays due to the prevailing circumstances that has contributed to financial pressure on them.

“We request that the government consider rental subsidy for workspaces used by startups which are regulated/owned/managed by government agencies,” it added.

The body also requested for a “blanket suspension of all deadlines including tax payment deadlines and filing deadlines until at least four weeks post lifting of all city lockdown”.

These include relaxation of deadline to file Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate (FIRC), option to avail overdraft facility/interest free and equity convertible funding, waiver of fines/penalties for offences violations related to procedural matters, extension of due date for payment of advance tax, and waiver of restrictions for claiming an expense as a deduction under Section 40 of the IT Act.

Provident Fund

Nasscom suggested that payment of provident fund and gratuity deposits should be deferred for the duration of the lockdown, and provide an option to employees for a one-time PF opt-out option for the next financial year 2020-21 given that startups are unlikely to be able to provide any salary increments due to subdued business environment.

“In such a case, both the employee and employer contributions towards the PF may be transferred directly to the employee. This will result in an increase in the take home pay of the employees. This move will be beneficial for the employees in the lower salary bracket and would lead to a higher take home pay for a majority of the start-up workforce,” it said.

Nasscom also sought deferral of interest payment deadlines and relaxation of loan interest payments. Besides, it suggested that governments and PSUs be encouraged to procure Make-in-India software products, and incentives/sops for consumption of indigenous products.

For MSMEs, Nasscom said interest and penalties should be waived for delayed payments of TDS and GST due for the month of March, April and May 2020 if such payment is made by June 30, 2020.

“The working capital of MSME businesses is already stressed and the pandemic has further aggravated the situation. As an immediate relief, all government departments (Centre/State)/PSUs/large corporations must be directed to release all pending payments/invoice receivables raised by the MSMEs within 15 working days,” it added.

The body recommended that separate credit lines be given to MSMEs for handling global recessions.

“To minimise the impact of the pandemic and ensure minimum disruption in supply chain, government must ensure adequate credit flow to the MSMEs (small and medium enterprises),” it noted.

Therefore, it must be ensured that the existing Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) is accelerated with the Turn Around Time (TAT) of issuance of funds by SIDBI reduced to 7 working days, it added.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/covid-19-nasscom-urges-government-to-defer-tax-payment-return-filing-for-startups-msmes/article31193408.ece

Hey there, and welcome back to Clued In!

This gloomy Sunday, get a shot in the arm with a deep (or superficial) clue by Incognito...

The Hindu Cryptic #12895 | Incognito| (8 Across) Clue surface : Disreputable bar’s urgent order for subs (4) Answer : DIVE Definition: Dispreputable bar; urgent order for subs Clue type : Double definition

Such a fun surface.

So, Dive Bars in the United States are shady sort of drinking holes that serve cheap entertainment and are often located in basements. One such bar is known as a Dive.

Surely such places are likely to receive urgent orders from clientelle for food items such as sub-sandwiches...

... as are submarines, which have to spring (or plunge) to action when they receive an urgent order to dive, or go under...

.... which is also something that folks entering dive bars in the 1800s might have done, both as they entered the underground pub and after an overdose of a binge.

Such a tiny word to offer so much scope for lateral thinking.

Happy Sunday, everybody. Stay safe, and don’t go under any time soon!

dive sounds like: dahyv verb — to go below the surface (underwater or underground)

This time we pick a word that would be Greek to most of us non-physicists. But it still is a beautiful sort of word (as is, you could argue, anything that has logic in it).

The Hindu Cryptic #12894 | Neyartha | (9 Across) Clue surface : Relating to the study of matter deformation by the man entering the cool rig at sea (9) Answer : RHEOLOGIC Definition: Relating to the study of matter deformation Clue type : Anagram, insertion Annotation : HE (pronoun for ‘the man’) is inserted into (indicated by ‘entering’) ROLOGIC, which is an anagram (indicated by ‘at sea’) of ‘cool rig’

The word is an adjective derived from ‘rheology’, which is the study of how specific substances flow and change form as they move. Think flubber sloshing about in a petri dish and you’ve got the idea.

rheologic sounds like: ree-uh- law -jick noun — relating to the study of matter deformation and flow Etymology: Greek rhéos meaning stream

343,2020/03/28,It’s also a fight against punitive measures,"The requirement of massive resources following the pandemic may be an occasion to lift global economic sanctions

A global pandemic demands game-changing actions by all nations in order to halt its global spread, provide relief in terms of medical supplies and to rebuild shattered lives. The global community has the responsibility to rise to the occasion. Any global cataclysm affects poor countries more than the rich ones as the former do not have the resources to meet the unexpected economic challenge. While the developed countries and their groups provide economic packages to themselves and their partners, developing countries stare into the distance with hope of handouts from the international financial institutions or some generous rich allies.

One way of dealing with the emergency in an emergency mode is to consider lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations and individual countries on developing countries. Many international sanctions imposed on the basis of political and economic decisions and taken as a part of diplomatic efforts by countries, multilateral or regional organisations against states or organisations exist around the world. These were meant either to ‘protect national security interests, or to protect international law, and defend against threats to international peace and security. These measures include the temporary imposition on a target of economic, trade, diplomatic, cultural or other restrictions’ and can be lifted only through a long process of ascertaining whether their objectives were met.

The UN Security Council has a ‘mandate by the international community to apply sanctions that are binding on all UN member states. They serve as the international community’s most powerful peaceful means to prevent threats to international peace and security or to settle them’. Peace enforcement is possible if the sanctions fail, but that is only in the rarest of rare cases. The sanctions often lie dormant for technical reasons even if their original intent and purpose have lost their relevance. The victims of these sanctions suffer in silence or engage in negotiations to get relief.

When America struck

Apart from UN sanctions, there are ‘unilateral sanctions that are imposed by individual countries in furtherance of their strategic objectives. Typically intended as strong economic coercion, measures applied under unilateral sanctions can range between coercive diplomatic efforts, economic warfare, or a threat of war’. These take the form of economic, diplomatic, military and sport sanctions.

The unilateral sanctions are naturally not mandatory to any other state, but the United States has often stipulated, like in the case of Iran, that those countries which do not apply sanctions to Iran would be debarred from doing business with the U.S., a Hobson’s choice in many cases.

After the initial invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, the UN ‘placed an embargo on the nation in an attempt to prevent an armed conflict. A naval and air blockade was added. The purpose of the initial sanctions was to coerce Iraq into following international law, which included the recognised sovereignty of Kuwait’. But even after the liberation of Kuwait, a series of sanctions were created to weaken the country. A UN plan to purchase food and medicines by selling Iraqi oil to the world became one of the most serious scandals to hit the UN and its Secretary General. U.S. sanctions against Iran over the years broke the back of the country and forced it to reach an agreement to limit its nuclear activities. The U.S.’s withdrawal from the Iran deal has now resulted in Iran facing crippling sanctions. Perhaps, the impact of COVID-19 was severe in Iran on account of the sanctions and the resultant economic crisis in the country. There are many more cases of sanctions against many countries still in existence. Temporary sanctions in protest against the policies of countries often result in expulsion or withdrawal of diplomatic personnel.

The politics of sanctions entered a new era when U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” (CAATSA) that grouped together sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea. Currently, the U.S. alone, or together with other countries has sanctions against Belarus, Myanmar, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, and Zimbabwe and several other countries.

The wide network of sanctions is comprehensively monitored by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US Department of the Treasury which enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes and related entities and individuals.

No calculation

There is no estimate of the losses sustained by these countries on account of these sanctions. But these countries will be much relieved if these restrictions are removed. The present global pandemic and the requirement of massive resources may be an occasion to lift these sanctions. The countries which have imposed these sanctions will not have to make any financial outlay to assist these countries at this time of a humanitarian emergency.

The G20 Chairman, the King of Saudi Arabia, on a suggestion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had convened a video conference of G20 leaders. As a follow up of that meeting, the G20 could consider proposing the lifting of multilateral and bilateral sanctions. As Winston Churchill said, “ Never let a good crisis go to waste.”

344,2020/03/28,RBI’s guns boom: On lockdown relief,"India’s financial system will need more support as the virus crisis evolves

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) finally rolled out its big guns on Friday to fight the effects of the coronavirus on the financial system. Businesses were clamouring for relief and Governor Shaktikanta Das’s measures address the crucial factor of sustaining system liquidity while offering palliatives to individuals and businesses. The measures seem to have been designed assuming the best case scenario that the country will be able to fight off the maleficent effects of the virus in the next few weeks. But there is no certainty over how long this uncertainty will prolong which means that Mr. Das’s announcements, as indeed that of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday, can only be the initial steps needed to protect the economy. There will be more to do as the crisis evolves; governments and regulators are reacting to events, as opposed to being proactive, simply because this is a kind of crisis that they have not dealt with before. Viewed from this perspective, the RBI’s steps are exactly what is needed at this point in time. They reflect the central bank’s willingness to listen to impulses from the ground and its effort to stay ahead of the curve, which is laudable.

The sizeable rate cut will obviously make the headlines though its impact will be largely on sentiment. Existing borrowers will benefit assuming that banks pass on the cut quickly — it is hoped that they really do so — but there is going to be nothing like the cut spurring fresh investment, which will be the last thing on the minds of businessmen. To that extent the size of the cut appears a trifle too large. But where the RBI scores is in the liquidity enhancement measures that it has unveiled. The sum total of new long-term repo operations of ₹1-lakh crore, and ₹1.37-lakh crore each from the cut in cash reserve ratio and increase in marginal standing facility (overnight borrowings by banks from the RBI) adds up to a very significant ₹3.74-lakh crore. Together with the ₹2.8-lakh crore pumped in through various market interventions since February, the RBI’s liquidity injection amounts to a whopping 3.4% of GDP. To be sure, there will be consequences of heightened liquidity but that is a problem for another day. The priority is to keep the system lubricated. The moratorium on term loans and deferment of interest on working capital loans will reduce anxiety among businesses and individuals who will see a fall in income/cash flows. The central bank has also done the right thing by widening the policy rate corridor — the reverse repo rate cut is 15 basis points more than that in the repo rate. This will hopefully push banks away from their ‘lazy banking’ practices and force them to lend more. In sum, it is a good start by the RBI but it needs to keep thinking on its feet and react quickly as the situation evolves.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rbis-guns-boom-the-hindu-editorial-on-lockdown-relief/article31186784.ece
345,2020/03/28,Trial and turmoil: On Israel government formation,"Netanyahu has earned another reprieve, but it might not last long

Thursday’s election of Benny Gantz, leader of the opposition Blue and White party, as Speaker of the Knesset, signals the path to a unity government in Israel after three inconclusive general elections in 12 months. In a U-turn, the former military general who was invited by Israel’s President to form a government after the indecisive polls, nominated himself as leader of the legislature and won backing from members. The full implications of this latest twist in Israeli politics remain unclear. But Mr. Gantz had until now repeatedly rebuffed calls from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to collaborate on a unity government with a view to breaking the year-long political deadlock. He had even contemplated legislation to limit the Prime Minister’s tenure to two-terms, as well as to block persons indicted for corruption from occupying the office. The target was Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving leader who also faces trial in three cases of graft. While Mr. Gantz’s latest move is possibly a response triggered by the pandemic, the sudden about-turn has caused outrage among supporters of Blue and White and its allies as a complete betrayal and could split the party.

But despite the awkward compromises involved, the political reconfiguration bodes well for democracy in Israel. Parliament was suspended after the March polls on the pretext of restrictions arising from the pandemic by Yuli Edelstein, the former Knesset Speaker and Netanyahu ally. That decision was subsequently overruled by the Supreme Court, which ordered Mr. Edelstein’s successor to be chosen on Wednesday, forcing the latter’s resignation. Mr. Gantz’s elevation has averted the risk of a constitutional void. Politically, the step could be the first in a complicated process leading to a power-sharing arrangement with his arch-rival, Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud party. The new government would be confronted with the ticklish issue of Mr. Netanyahu’s trial, which has already been postponed until May. While the Prime Minister has consistently denied any wrongdoing, a conducive climate for an independent investigation would infuse much confidence into the administration. Moreover, stitching together a viable coalition would be no mean challenge, given that Mr. Netanyahu, 70, remains a highly polarising figure. For instance, any support from the Joint List, the third largest bloc in the Knesset, comprising factions within Israel’s Arab community, would depend on the extent of influence parties of the extreme right exert in any new government. With the 15 seats it controls, the bloc will manoeuvre hard for influence. With its strong anti-Arab stance, Avigdor Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu party — it has seven seats — would be another important factor. Mr. Netanyahu may have earned another reprieve. But after more than a decade in office, he cannot afford to underestimate the strength of sentiment against him.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/trial-and-turmoil-the-hindu-editorial-on-israel-government-formation/article31186795.ece
346,2020/03/28,Chaos at National College Grounds as Kalasipalyam market wholesalers arrive,"The civic body’s plan to convert a few playgrounds into vegetable and fruit markets did not take off on Saturday on account of logistical problems. The first day of the initiative was marked by miscommunication and chaos at Shankarapura after wholesale traders from the Kalasipalyam market started shifting their produce to the National College Grounds under the impression that they had been granted permission to do so by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). This misconception arose after civic officials reached out to the merchants to discuss the merits of a relocation.

According to sources in the BBMP, the decision was not final and no arrangements were made for the move. However, several merchants thought the matter was settled and started moving their produce on Friday night itself. BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said talks on shifting the market were still in progress at the time and nothing had been agreed upon. “In the meantime, without any communication and permission, they all of a sudden shifted to National College Grounds,” he said.

As word spread, hundreds of residents and retail buyers thronged the ground, throwing any semblance of maintaining social distancing to the wind. The rules of the lockdown in the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic were forgotten and hundreds of vehicles were parked outside the ground while the police watched helplessly.

All the wholesalers were finally evicted around 11 a.m. by the BBMP, after residents and elected representatives intervened. D.N. Ramesh, councillor, Sunkenahalli ward, said the chaos was created because of mismanagement and miscommunication from wholesalers and civic officials. S. Manjunath, of Shankarapuram Residents’ Welfare Association, urged the authorities not to shift entire markets to grounds located in residential areas as it would defeat the purpose of social distancing and the lockdown. “If only retailers and pushcart vendors are allowed in, then the Fort High School Ground will be a better option,” he said, adding that the National College Grounds should not be converted into a wholesale market.

New location

The BBMP finally decided to shift the Kalasipalyam wholesale market to Singena Agrahara in Anekal taluk. “We have assured the merchants that arrangements for a temporary market will be made at Singena Agrahara, with all the precautionary measures, from Monday. We have asked licensed wholesale merchants to shift there as soon as possible,” a BBMP official said.

The BBMP Commissioner said there were 423 licensed wholesale merchants operating out of the two-acre Kalasipalyam market, with hundreds of trucks and lorries, and thousands of retailers, pushcart vendors and even residents visiting every day. “Hence, social distancing is impossible there. At Singena Agrahara, there is a 43-acre plot available, with a fruit market already operating from there,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/2toari/article31195309.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGMARKET1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/chaos-at-national-college-grounds-as-kalasipalyam-market-wholesalers-arrive/article31195310.ece
347,2020/03/28,"COVID-19 lockdown: Bengaluru police issue nearly 80,000 passes","The city police have issued nearly 80,000 passes to representatives of essential services and some individuals who cited personal emergencies. However, this has not gone down well with senior officials in the police and other departments.

“It dilutes the purpose of the lockdown. How can we enforce it if hundreds of vehicles have road passes?” asked a senior police officer. To prevent people from gathering at their respective Deputy Commissioner of Police offices to collect passes, the police have started issuing them online. “This means that more people will get them,” the officer said.

Another police officer raised a complaint saying that her friend was able to get a pass for her domestic help. “This is sheer misuse and needs immediate action,” the officer said. On Saturday, there was a noticeable increase in traffic on the roads.

According to sources, the idea of a total lockdown came into question after a face-off between Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan and Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao at a meeting held in Vidhana Soudha recently. “Mr. Ashwath Narayan accused Mr. Rao of favouritism for allowing some food chains to operate and restricting others. This was seriously taken and after the review meeting, it was decided that passes would be issued to people working for essential services and those who are in emergency situations,” a senior police officer said.

“We cannot use force, so all we can do is request people not to conduct unnecessary work or misuse this privilege,”’ said another officer.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-lockdown-bengaluru-police-issue-nearly-80000-passes/article31195268.ece
348,2020/03/28,Maids who tested positive for coronavirus spark off panic in Bengaluru,"The authorities have undertaken contact tracing after two maids who worked for a couple in Sanjaynagar, who had recently returned from abroad, contracted the novel coronavirus. One of the maids lived in Geddalahalli and worked for several houses in Dollars Colony. Tension gripped the area after it was revealed that one of the houses she worked in was close to the Chief Minister’s residence. BBMP officials and the police inspected the area and her residence in Geddalahalli.

“More worrying is the fact that the woman had interacted with around 70 people, including other families for whom she worked as a domestic help,” said a police source. “She was in close contact with her neighbours in Geddalahalli and six of her family members. The authorities are undertaking contact tracing as the area she lives in is congested and there is a common washroom.”

However soon after the lockdown, most of the people who had interacted with her, who were labourers from Yadgir, returned to their native towns. “The information has been communicated to our counterparts in Yadgir, and civic officials are monitoring the case,” the source said.

350,2020/03/28,COVID-19: No family or personal life for these nurses,"Santosh Kumar B. has not held his three-year-old daughter in his arms for over 20 days. Whenever he feels like seeing her, he makes a video call. He is not a soldier fighting enemies at the border, but he is no less — he is a staff nurse attending to patients infected with COVID-19 at a city hospital.

“I sent my daughter away with my wife to her grandparents’ house soon after I was posted in the Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratory at Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI) to collect blood samples and throat swabs of patients with COVID-19 symptoms,” said the 34-year-old, a nurse at Victoria Hospital.

“In the initial days, we did not have COVID-19 personal protection equipment (PPE) kits and were using HIV PPE kits, which cover only the front of the body. Exposure to the infection is usually high in labs while collecting throat swabs, and with HIV PPE kits the risk was even more. Patients tend to cough and sneeze more while their throat swab is collected, putting us at risk. I did not want my family to be exposed to any infection,” he said.

Since March 23, Mr. Kumar, who is also president of the BMCRI Permanent Staff Nurses’ Association, has been under a 14-day self-quarantine. He will be posted in the isolation ward after that.

In wards, the exposure to infection is high, especially if the patient needs to be administered intravenous fluids, for which a cannula has to be put. Sources say the protective gear is single layered and there is a chance of exposure to the virus even if there is a small tear.

Shanta M., a staff nurse working in the COVID-19 isolation ward at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD), has also isolated herself from her family for the past one month.

As most Group D workers in government hospitals are hired on contract and are not trained to work in isolation wards, it is inevitable for nurses to attend to all the needs of the patients. “We enter the isolation ward wearing a full-body protective gear, but our jobs carry the greatest risk of exposure. We cannot have our food on time or even drink water frequently as we will have to remove the protective gear. We have to change the gear every time we come out and re-enter the ward,” said Ms. Shanta.

Providing support

These nurses don’t have to deal with just the medical needs of the patients. “Most of them are psychologically disturbed as isolation means a whole new environment for them. Although mental health counsellors have been counselling them, we make them feel comfortable in the wards. We interact with them and reassure them that there is nothing to worry about even if they test positive, as they can be treated with medicines,” she said.

So far, these healthcare workers have been going to their individual accommodations after their shifts of six to eight hours at the hospital. However, now the hospital authorities are working on arranging accommodations for them within the campus.

“Faced with a shortage of staff, sending every nurse on a 14-day quarantine is not possible for government hospitals. But we are working on sending every COVID-19 ward nurse on a 14-day quarantine after 4-5 days of work. This is essential as some nurses have been working without a break ever since cases started coming in,” said a senior doctor from RGICD.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/8wmq3e/article31195196.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGNURSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-no-family-or-personal-life-for-these-nurses/article31193573.ece
351,2020/03/28,COVID-19 has domestic workers stuck between a rock and a hard place,"Rajeshwari (name changed) is confused and restless these days. On the one hand, she is unsure of how to deal with calls from some of her employers asking her to report to work, and on the other she is unable to leave the city to visit her sons, who are in Dharmapuri, Tamil Nadu.

Many domestic workers, who are vital to the smooth functioning of homes, are facing a similar trepidation. While some employers have asked them to stop reporting to work ever since they started taking the risk of the COVID-19 spread seriously, others are still expecting them to show up. This, despite mobility being severely hampered by the lockdown. The police are cracking down on even those venturing out on foot.

The issue of whether the forced holiday is going to affect their pay is also playing on the minds of maids and cooks. “I work in six houses and most of them started asking me to stop coming to work when the State lockdown was announced. We [she and her husband] were planning to go to Dharmapuri to stay with our children, but the national lockdown was announced and we got stuck here. Now, one or two employers who have figured out that I’m still in the city are calling me back to work. I don’t know what to do,” said Ms. Rajeshwari, who lives at Vigyan Nagar.

In apartment complexes and buildings, residents have started complaining about their neighbours who are yet to give leave to their domestic workers. The fact that maids are still reporting to work raises the risk of infection for themselves, the families they work for, and others. “Every day, I see many domestic workers coming in to work in my apartment block. It is as if nothing has changed. I am worried, given how quickly the virus spreads,” said Aravi, a resident of Shantinagar.

Role of union

Those who are part of the Domestic Workers’ Rights Union have also been raising the issue of many members being forced to go to work, and in other cases facing the possibility of losing pay because of the lockdown.

Geetha Menon, joint secretary of the union, said they were in the process of raising awareness among workers about the symptoms of the disease. “They kept going to work till Monday. Only when the national lockdown happened did they stop. Some say they are being asked to come to work. There is a threat of not being paid,” she said.

The union has submitted an advisory to the Labour Department about workers in the unorganised sector and the COVID-19 issue, with special mention of domestic workers, social security, and protection.

“We also want an advisory to residents’ welfare associations to include giving paid leave to domestic workers. The other advisory we have given is on ration and safety nets,” she said.

Another problem is people who want to go to work. The union is coming across workers who do not want to stay in the cramped spaces they live in, choosing instead to be at work. “Complaints of domestic violence have also been coming in during this period.

Human rights activists have demanded a probe into an incident in Bhoopasandra where a youth, along with his brother and other family members, assaulted two constables on Wednesday and was shot in the leg a day later when he allegedly attacked the police and tried to flee during a spot inspection.

A video of the accused, Tajuddin, attacking the constables on Wednesday as they tried to enforce the lockdown, had gone viral.

However, a new video clip has emerged showing the police beating and kicking Tajuddin and his friend Khutbuddin.

It was purportedly shot a few minutes before the police were attacked.

co), said the video clips should not be viewed in isolation and that the series of events should be viewed holistically.

Three FIRs

The Sanjay Nagar Police have registered three FIRs in connection with the series of incidents.

The first FIR is against two unidentified youths who were doing wheelies on a scooter in Bhoopasandra on Wednesday afternoon. According to the FIR, the accused tried to hit the constables Basavaraja and Manjunatha. They then kicked the barricades and fled.

An hour later, the two constables reported finding the youths on a street in the area and approached them to arrest them. According to the second FIR, they abused the constables verbally, called other people in the neighbourhood and attacked them physically. The youth, identified in the second FIR as brothers Tajuddin and Khutbuddin, were joined by their parents Shabuddin and Yasmeen Sultana among others who also attacked the constables.

Family arrested

Tajuddin allegedly threw a stone at one of the constables, but the group fled when a Hoysala arrived at the spot. The police arrested the entire family of two sons and their parents and booked them for attempt to murder among other offences.

The new video that has now emerged shows the two constables beating up two youth, purportedly Tajuddin and Khutbuddin. “As the constables approached the duo to arrest them for trying to run them over with their scooter earlier, the youths became defensive and resisted arrest. Force was used to arraign them. But by the time they could be taken into custody, others joined and the duo again attacked the cops,” Mr. Shashi Kumar said.

The Hindu could not verify the exact sequence of events among the contradictory versions.

On Thursday, Tajuddin was taken for a spot inspection, when he allegedly tried to flee and attacked the cops yet again. In retaliation, the police shot him in the leg. A third FIR was filed in this connection.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/27jpxz/article31189541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bengaluruJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/new-video-gives-twist-to-bengaluru-assault-case/article31189492.ece
353,2020/03/28,Bored at home? Learn dance online for free,"Dance studios in the city offer classes on social media platforms

Do you love to dance? But, are unable to step out to a studio due to the lockdown? Now, for thousands confined to their houses, dance studios in the city are offering free learning sessions online, through social media platforms.

For instance, The Swingers, a dance company and studio, has been teaching hundreds of people hip-hop and freestyle through Instagram videos in the evening. Prasanna Kumar of The Swingers said: “During times when most people are nervous, restless or frustrated, dance will be therapeutic. It has the power to improve mental and physical health. Otherwise, people will continue browsing on their mobiles or watching TV.”

This could potentially get more people interested in dance, he said. “There are many who want to give dance a shot, but are apprehensive and shy. Through the classes, they can learn at home and see how interested they are,” he added. The sessions are currently getting hundreds of views, every day. To encourage students, the studio is also asking them to post their videos, and a few of them get featured on the studio’s Instagram page.

Similarly, Raack Academy of Dance plans to have free online dance classes from April 6, for four weeks. Each day, there will be a class for an hour and a half, on their Facebook page and website. Ramana Balaji, of Raack Academy of Dance, said: “From 8-year-olds to adults, anyone can learn from the sessions. We plan to teach a few styles of hip-hop. These will be recorded sessions and will be posted every day in the evening. Once in a while, we will also have webinars. This will particularly keep children engaged and excited.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/kjrd8l/article31195251.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SWINGERS001,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bored-at-home-learn-dance-online-for-free/article31195252.ece

357,2020/03/28,"Soon, passes for e-commerce delivery staff","Following complaints of harassment by the police from e-commerce companies, the Chennai Corporation has announced the issuance of passes for personnel associated with such firms.

Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash has empowered Joint Commissioner (Health) and Regional Deputy Commissioners (Works/North/Central/South) to issue COVID-19 passes for people and personnel who come under the categories of essential services, to function during the lockdown. The passes will be issued at the head office or regional offices.

Commercial and private establishments, factories, workshops, industries, transport, public utilities, media services, health and medical services have been exempted from the lockdown.

Representatives of online supermarkets said that they were “facing tremendous harassment, and their supplies were being routed to political party leaders”.

“We are not being allowed to sell. If this goes on, supplies will run out and we will not be able to replenish them,” said a representative of the company.

E-commerce companies in the city were able to meet only 10% of the demand. “The demand is very high. The only option is to strengthen local players to sell online. Many service providers have developed apps and made arrangements for fumigation and certification to meet the demand. But the police are not permitting local players and small entrepreneurs. The offices are not being allowed to be kept open. Grocery supply has been disrupted. Prices are set to rise because of a few wholesale players. There will be food riots if the situation continues.

358,2020/03/28,Police have a hard time tracking quarantine violators,"List of those under home quarantine given to Assistant Commissioners of Police

Home quarantined persons sneaking out are posing a nightmare to the police and civic officials.

When police personnel, accompanied by Corporation officials, recently went to track the status of home quarantined persons in the city, they were shocked to see some of them missing.

A father-son duo, who had returned from Bangkok and were home quarantined in Semathaman Colony in Koyambedu, had fled to Keezhakarai, Ramanathapuram, without informing authorities. The police also found a youth, supposed to be in home quarantine, roaming the streets of Anna Nagar. “Though they did not have any symptoms of COVID-19, they were told to stay home by health officials, but some of them did not follow the 14-day rule, as was required,” said a police officer in Anna Nagar.

ACPs have been given the list of persons who are under home quarantine, in their jurisdictions, and they in turn have deputed personnel to monitor the houses.

“Thinking that they are free from the disease and that they will not spread the virus to others, a few of them break the quarantine,” a police officer in Washermenpet said. “Recently, a youth returned from Croatia and was asked to stay indoors for 14 days. He went to a relative’s house in Marakkanam for a festival. We called him back to the city and have confined him in his house,” the officer said. A woman, a senior citizen, came from the U.S. and was taken to a quarantine ward in Poonamallee. But she escaped from there and reached her house in K.K. Nagar. Police personnel fanned out and nabbed her and got her readmitted in the facility.

The police filed a dozen cases last week, under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC, read with provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/91zjpf/article31195117.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THFOOTBALL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/police-have-a-hard-time-tracking-quarantine-violators/article31195118.ece
359,2020/03/28,Coronavirus: These NGO’s are working around lockdown restrictions to feed the needy,"For daily wage earners, a 21-day lockdown means an abrupt pause in livelihood. Here are some NGOs who have their back

Many of us, while checking our bank accounts and our stocked fridges this week, have felt a moment of gratitude for the economic security nets that we have, that will help us tide over the next 21 days. But there are also many who don’t have this net, and now do not have the option of stepping out to earn their daily wage. And so, some organisations are helping the fortunate former reach out to help the latter.

For instance, Chennai-based Sumanasa Foundation has called for contributions to fulfil a target of ₹20,000, in order to provide 100 kilograms of rice, 50 kilograms of dal, 45 litres of oil, 15 kilograms of salt, jeera, turmeric and chilli powder for the city’s community kitchens, run by the Greater Chennai Corporation. Yuva (Youth for Unity and Voluntary Action), a non-profit in Mumbai, is fundraising online to provide daily needs to over 2,000 families they surveyed in the metropolis. They require funding not only for food and groceries, but also for volunteers’ safety gear.

The NGO Safa, has been working with daily wagers like auto drivers, vendors and some members of the trans community of Hyderabad for 11 years now, and also have a presence in Chennai, Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi. Founder-president Rubina Nafees Fatima describes the situation in Hyderabad, “Even the night shelters, where we usually have difficulty convincing people — especially women — to move to, are seeing long queues of people hoping for food.” Safa has been providing a standardised package of rations “that can sustain a family of four for about five days” in the hotspots that they have located around the city.

“We identify two people in each basti (hamlet) to volunteer giving out these packets at each door, so as to avoid queues. We have also trained our volunteers about hygiene and social distancing,” she says. Safa has been doing this for a few days now, but since the lockdown came into effect, supplies are expected to dry out soon. The main bottleneck is that of permits, both for people and vehicles. “We have vans and trucks with permits now, but need volunteer drivers. Wholesalers are also falling short of labour. Besides these, each city has its own unique problems,” she says, adding that the organisation is rolling out an app to coordinate with those who want to help.

Similarly, Bengaluru-based NGO Hasiru Dala received permits for its vehicles and staff members only on Friday, says Lakshmi Karunakaran, a member of its children’s programme. “The challenges are multiple, because there is a complete freeze,” she says. “Before the lockdown, a relief work sticker on some of our vehicles would help them ply. Now, we need to give documents and the vehicle number in order to get a pass for each person on ground.” So even if more people are ready to volunteer, she explains, they have to wait till they get a pass, since movement in public is understandably under restriction.

The NGO has been working with waste pickers in six towns and cities of Karnataka for 11 years now, including Bengaluru, Mysore and Hubli. “They pick recyclable paper and other things during the day, and sell them to scrap dealers at night — none of which they can do at the moment. Many of them are not from stable homes, or are migrants, or have no ration cards. We have identified about 2,000 families who don’t have ration cards, since they can’t avail the relief announced by the State Government,” says Lakshmi.

Since the informal norms of social distancing began, they had begun distributing food kits and children’s hygiene kits (including soap and handkerchiefs).

“Before the lockdown was announced, we had managed to give out 260 food kits, each containing five kilograms of toor dal, some masoor dal, oil, soaps, chilli powder and jaggery, in addition to 25 kilograms of regular rice, or boiled rice, or maize or wheat flour, depending on where the family had migrated from,” says Lakshmi, adding, “Since the lockdown, we have been running around for permission. But now that we have them, we can start work again.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wyoek1/article31192582.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MPYUVANGO1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/these-ngos-are-working-around-coronavirus-lockdown-restrictions-to-feed-the-needy/article31192583.ece
360,2020/03/28,Chennai police book cases against 278 people for violation of section 144,"Additionally, two cases were booked against people who left their homes despite being quarantined

From Friday evening onwards, the Chennai City Police have booked 278 cases against people for venturing out despite prohibitory orders being in place.

The city has been under lockdown from 6 p.m. on Tuesday to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been in force to prevent people from gathering in any place. City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan issued the prohibitory orders pursuant to the lockdown announcement by Prime Minister Modi.

As many as 156 check-posts have been installed across the city. The Assistant Commissioners of Police and Inspectors of Police with personnel from their respective jurisdiction have intensified vigil. Beat patrolling and sector-wise patrolling on two-wheelers has been increased in the city.

“From 6 p.m on Friday, until 6 a.m. on Saturday, 278 cases were booked against persons who violated prohibitory orders across the city. Two more cases were booked against persons who left their homes despite being quarantined under Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act,” said police sources.

Over 123 vehicles, including 120 bikes, were seized for violation of prohibitory orders.

Separately, Traffic police personnel booked five persons for drunken driving, 780 persons for not wearing helmets and 230 for violating other rules of the Motor Vehicles Rules.

361,2020/03/28,"Police Inspector in Chennai goes door to door, offers help to the elderly","The law and order inspector in Nolambur has been arranging for food to be delivered to senior citizens in his jurisdiction, during the lockdown period

﻿

While a few policemen have came under criticism for assaulting and punishing people who have violated section 144 in the city, there are many in the the force who go beyond the call of duty in order to help residents. One such person is inspector M. Sathyalingam, law and order inspector in Nolambur who has been identifying elderly persons living alone in his jurisdiction and helping them.

Ever since the lockdown began, the inspector has been going around his jurisdiction in his patrol vehicle and using the public address system, he has been asking people to stay indoors. “I then started doing a door-to-door campaign and started creating awareness about the importance of staying indoors. It was then I understood that many elderly people are finding it hard to get groceries and food,” said the inspector, who has served in the department for 18-years.

According to him there are 7,500 small and big apartment complexes in his jurisdiction which spans up to 9 kilometres. “There are around 18,000 aged families in my range and of these, around 1,000 are living alone. Some of them were finding it hard to get food. So I thought the police could render some help. I provided my number to them and asked them to call me whenever they are in need of anything,” he added.

With the help of volunteers, he prepared and packed food. “We provided it to those who asked. However since app-based food delivery and home delivery of groceries is now allowed, within a stipulated time, some won’t need it. But there are few who do not use smart phones and we will continue to help them,” he added.

Besides, the Nolambur police have been identifying homeless people and are housing them in a community hall after conducting tests.

Residents said that the police were performing a noble service. “They came to our house on Friday and enquired if we need any help. The inspector provided his number and asked us to call if we need anything,” said P. S.

362,2020/03/28,COVID-19: How Chennai’s Kasturba Nagar became a ‘breakfast joint’,"Janani Venkitesh started serving breakfast to conservancy workers; inspired by her example, other residents of the neighbourhood are doing the same thing

In a world that has suddenly turned upside down, where regular systems are on hold, routine is disrupted and there is even danger attached to following one’s routine, having to continue living and working as if nothing has changed is the utmost challenge any human can face.

Conservancy workers are among those who face this challenge. Their routine has changed — how and when they get to work and even where they eat — but the work itself hasn’t.

Early this week, when Janani Venkitesh learnt that the conservancy workers reporting for work in her locality, Kasturba Nagar, were forgoing their breakfast due to changes in their routine, she was actually on her second coffee of the morning.

She gulped hard.

And that is when the breakfast she cooked grew bigger, with extra portions being made for these conservancy workers.

“Their work begins very early and they have their breakfast between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., usually buying food from a roadside eatery. As most of the shops are closed now, many workers skip breakfast,” says Janani who is secretary, Residents of Kasturba Nagar Association (ROKA).

(Conservancy workers are now transported to their work spots by special vehicles arranged by the government; though this is commendable, it may still signify a break in routine for them, for if they had the option of heading to work on their own, they might have a few extra minutes at home when they can wolf down home-made breakfast.)

Janani had served them breakfast along with coffee for two consecutive days, but her neighbours wouldn’t let her continue playing host to them ad infinitum.

Janani explains that when she shared the matter on the Association’s WhatsApp group – numbering over 150 people – the response was overwhelming. Many residents offered to cook breakfast for the conservancy workers. The breakfast-offer calendar is booked up to April 5, adds Janani.

“Each of us will take turns to provide breakfast. This is one way of acknowledging their service and expressing our gratitude for keeping our streets clean even while exposing themselves to the risk of Coronavirus infection,” says P. Saranya, another resident of Kasturba Nagar.

“This is a one-off situation that all of us find ourselves in, and it is necessary to make it different for them and for ourselves,” says Janani, adding that when they are out here helping us when they don’t have to, they absolutely deserve to have some good home-made breakfast every day during these trying times.

Janani shares a special bond with these conservancy workers as she is part of the group from ROKA that had been going along with them, before the novel Coronavirus outbreak, to ensure residents’ compliance with waste management rules.

Every day, three residents of Venketachalam Nagar in Thirumullaivoyal, take a walk through the locality, separately and at a pre-set hour, covering all streets, to inquire from residents, especially senior citizens without any support system, if they are finding any difficulty accessing essential items such as groceries and milk.

An initiative of Venketachalam Nagar Residents Welfare Association, it supplements the solicitous inquiries of this nature that already happen on the Association’s WhatsApp group. This exercise is being carried out for those residents who may not be part of the WhatsApp group, be unable to communicate through technological devices. It is primarily aimed at benefiting senior citizens, as many of them are not tech-savvy.

There are 18 streets in Venketachalam Nagar, and around 650 households.

So, two three-member teams fan into the neighbourhood, one in the morning and the other in the evening. Each member in the three-member team covers six streets.

Data about the total number of senior citizens in the locality and their health status have also been collected by the residents’ association, so that it would be easy to make the right decisions during an emergency.

N. Ravichandran, Avadi Municipal Commissioner, said the Amma canteens in the Corporation would also begin to serve dinner for the benefit of residents. “We have engaged 10 vehicles and one of Fire and Rescue Services Department to carry out disinfection daily. Nearly 150 km of roads are being disinfected every day as a precautionary measure for COVID-19,” he said.

Moreover, a team of workers are engaged in disinfection efforts at the household level too. Of the 1 lakh houses identified in various wards, nearly 40,000 houses have been covered so far. A team of 120 workers are also involved in distributing awareness notices and are required to get digital signatures of the residents, he added.

A total of 32 persons have been placed under home quarantine in the Corporation and are being monitored along with Health department.

365,2020/03/28,COVID-19: Villivakkam police take stay-at-home message to residents’ doorsteps,"Over the last one week, from across India, there have been images of police personnel forcing the “footloose” who stir from home and hit the streets, do an Indian from of sit-up (“thoppukaranam”). Images of police personnel wielding their batons also beamed into living rooms. One of the enduring images is that of a traffic policeman in Chennai being reduced to hand-folded despair, as he made an impassioned plea to motorists not to venture out unnecessarily.

The sight of the men in uniform does serve as a deterrent, and if this is paired to messages about Coronavirus safety delivered at doorsteps, the impact is likely to more powerful.

The Villivakkam police is adopting this strategy: With public address systems mounted on autorickshaws and patrol jeeps, they head down many streets within their jurisdictional limits, and play a pre-set five-minute stay-at-home audio message. With a mike, an announcer also reinforces the message that only the necessity of buying essential items should bring residents out of their homes. They are said to be covering over 100 streets, which are largely interior streets, and also sections of arterial roads such as CTH Road, New Avadi Road and Konnur High Road. Key intersections such as the Villivakkam junction and Nathamuni theatre traffic spot on CTH Road, Padi flyover and SIDCO Nagar are also being monitored for public gathering.

This exercise is being monitored by Rajesh Babu, inspector, Villivakkam police (Law and Order wing).

The Anna Nagar police district comprises police stations at Aminjikarai, Arumbakkam, Anna Nagar, Koyambedu, Koyambedu CMBT, Maduravoyal, Nolambur, Rajamangalam, Villivakkam, Kolathur, J.J Nagar and Thirumangalam.

Similar exercise

The Thirumangalam police personnel numbering more than 100 persons including around 60 policemen in the law & order and crime wings of the station, are also carrying out an awareness campaign involving public address systems mounted on autorickshaws.

366,2020/03/28,Shift to upscaling food rationing now,"Expanded rations will not only bring relief in this pandemic but also help sustain a nourished and healthy population

Two days ago, the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a ₹1.7-lakh crore package of social security measures to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic in the period of the 21-day lockdown. In respect of food security, the package falls far short of what is needed. I argue that we need to immediately ensure universal rationing with an expanded food basket, and special measures for cooked food in urban areas for the vulnerable population.

The burden of the current lockdown is borne disproportionately by the large unorganised workforce, comprising hundreds of millions of casual daily wage-workers and self-employed workers. India already holds the record for the largest number of malnourished persons in the world. As their ability to purchase food diminishes, a growing population of working people and their families will soon enter a phase of hunger and undernourishment. The answer to this looming and very real scenario of food insecurity lies in a massive programme of food rationing, far greater than what the Finance Minister has promised.

Lessons from history

To ensure that all people have access to adequate food in the midst of this unprecedented health and economic crisis with potentially high levels of mortality, we must immediately expand our food security system. Before I come to the components of such an expanded programme, let us briefly look at the lessons provided by the experience of other countries in using rationing in times of scarcity.

In the United Kingdom in the 1940s, rationing or a policy of “fair shares” was introduced in a period of war and scarcity. Starting in 1939, each and every person was issued a ration book, with a weekly entitlement that could be collected at a local grocery store. Rationing encompassed many commodities, starting with butter, bacon and sugar, and later augmented by eggs, biscuits, tinned food, meat, cereals, etc. A remarkable outcome of the war years was, as Amartya Sen has demonstrated, a significant improvement in vital statistics including a rise in life expectancy and a decline in the mortality rate. Despite heavy war casualties and a decline in consumer expenditure per capita, life expectancy actually improved. In the first six decades of the 20th century, the decade from 1941 to 1950 saw the largest increase in life expectancy in England and Wales.

India’s timeline

In India, the British introduced rationing in six cities in 1942, mainly to supply industrial workers with adequate food. Following demands from a strong political movement, Malabar became the first rural area to implement rationing in 1943. In the mid-1960s, the system of rationing or the Public Distribution System (PDS) was made a national universal programme, which steadily expanded till 1991. In the 1990s, the policies of liberalisation led to the withdrawal of universal rationing and its replacement by a policy of narrow targeting. Differential entitlements were provided for BPL (Below Poverty Line) and APL (Above Poverty Line) households. In 2013, the landmark National Food Security Act (NFSA), ensured legal entitlement to rations and other food-based schemes (such as mid-day meals in schools). Around 75% of rural households, and 50% of urban households, that is, a total of two-thirds of all households, were eligible for inclusion (now termed priority households) in the NFSA.

The implementation of the NFSA — notably the PDS, the Mid-day Meal Scheme, and the Integrated Child Development Services scheme — varies significantly across States; nevertheless, the infrastructure for distribution of food is in place in all parts of the country.

China’s strategy

In China, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), a planning body, was the key coordinator along with the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) in ensuring supplies of basic foods and price stability to the poor, especially in Wuhan province, the epicentre of the current pandemic, which was under lockdown since January 23, 2020.

The Chinese strategy had multiple components, which included public corporations and ministries, 300 large private companies, 200,000 private stores, and local government institutions. To illustrate, State-owned companies such as COFCO or the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation, and Sinograin (China Grain Reserves Corporation) supplied key commodities to Wuhan. This included 200 tonnes of rice, 50 tonnes of flour and noodles, and 300 tonnes of edible oils each day during the peak of the pandemic in February 2020. The National Grain Trade Centre has to date supplied 155,000 tonnes of corn and 154,000 tonnes of soyabean to Wuhan. Special delivery trucks for transport of vegetables were arranged, and the local government organised open-air markets.

Kerala was the first State in India to announce a package with income support measures and in-kind measures including free rations of 15 kg (grain) and provision of cheap meals. The government of Tamil Nadu announced free rations of rice, sugar, cooking oil and dal to all ration card holders. The supply of rations for unorganised workers is to be through Amma canteens. The Delhi government will give 1.5 times existing entitlements at no cost to all ration card holders.

Key points of a plan

In India a system of expanded rations must have the following components. First, for all rural households, free rations of rice and wheat at double the normal entitlement must be distributed. The current entitlement is about half the quantity of daily cereal intake recommended by the Indian Council of Medical Research: the new quantities should be the actual minimum requirement per person per day. The government of India has now doubled rations (rice or wheat) to all priority households, from 5 kg to 10 kg per person per month. However, this falls short, as the rations are not to all households but only priority households; the rations are not free (only the additional 5 kg is free).

The provision of rations must be universal: this is not the time to demarcate households by type of ration card or whether they have a ration card or by any form of biometrics. The system of identification of priority households is not error-proof, and no household wrongly excluded should be outside the ambit of rationing today. This upscaling is feasible as the country has stocks of 58 million tonnes of rice and wheat; and the wheat harvest is currently underway in north India.

Coronavirus | Kerala to provide free ration to all

Second, for all rural households, additional rations of cooking oil, sugar, salt and lentils should be provided on a regular basis. Soap must also be included in this list. As supplies have to be arranged, the distribution could be weekly or fortnightly in order to ensure smooth availability. It is good to see that the government of India has announced one kg of dal per household, but it needs to provide more commodities quickly.

Third, if milk, eggs and vegetables (or one or more of them) can be supplied, we can not only ensure basic food security at the time of a major health crisis, but actually address our burden of malnutrition.

For urban areas, we need a combination of provision of dry goods and of cooked food. All households with ration cards can be given the same entitlements as proposed for rural households.

For the vast numbers of workers and migrants in towns and cities, however, we must set up arrangements for preparation and delivery of cooked food. The large numbers of closed community kitchens (schools and colleges, company and office canteens, for example) and restaurant workers now sitting idle or laid off can be brought together to undertake a massive programme of provision of cooked meals at subsidised rates. Kerala has taken the lead here. This will require careful planning and technology to distribute food while ensuring physical distancing. The answer is not to simply close the Indira Canteens (serving low-cost meals) as Karnataka has done.

All the measures proposed must continue for at least three months, and be reviewed afterwards.

An imaginative massive exercise of expanded rations could not only provide succour in this pandemic but also bring in a policy shift that will help sustain a nourished and healthy population.

367,2020/03/28,"Letters to the Editor — March 28, 2020","Heading back

The picture accompanying the report, “Lockdown forces migrant workers to leg it home from Manesar” (Page, 1, March 27), is the real news. It is shocking that no arrangements were made to help people working outside their home States get back safely. That some of them are walking back 400 km without money and support is distressing. It is the duty of the Central and State governments to reach out to them. The companies they work for should have helped them.

M. Qasmi Nadwi,

Ganeshpur, Basti, Uttar Pradesh

The pictures evoke deep empathy. These citizens are on the periphery of the economy and it is deplorable that governments have not ensured their well-being. Their sheer helplessness speaks volumes about our tall claims of economic growth.

Anuj Sharma,

Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh

The plight of the worker in India is always one that is depressing. It is unfortunate that migrant labour is being subject to more hardship. That many have to walk back, literally starving, is disheartening. Those who are privileged must help.

Zacharia Verghese,

Kozhikode

It is sad that a country which is professed to be a developed and advanced haven is unable to ensure that the downtrodden have their basic rights met. The report, “15 to a room, without a morsel” (Inside pages, March 27) brought tears to my eyes. The lockdown has garnered praise from different quarters, but what about denizens who have not even tasted a morsel?

Fuzail Ahmed,

Tirurangadi, Malappuram, Kerala

While physical distancing is indispensable in preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus, self-quarantine and early detection are of immense importance. It is important for people to be checked especially after inter-State travel. Many are skipping this out of fear of isolation or sheer irresponsibility. Migrants from affected States such as Maharashtra, Kerala, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh may be carriers of the virus and still asymptomatic. This could lead to massive local transmission.

Shayan Das,

Gobardanga, West Bengal

It is one thing to empathise with the workers and quite another to ignore the possibility of them being infected or infecting others on their way back. The loss of work may have precipitated this, but remaining where they were would have been a better option. A physically fit person can cover only 30 to 35 km a day which means that they will have to walk for at least a fortnight continuously. It is doubtful whether they would be welcome in their hometowns. When the government’s order is to stay indoors, walking back should have been the last option.

V. Lakshmanan,

Tirupur, Tamil Nadu

Prohibitory orders

In Tamil Nadu, the police should constantly review their actions and permit people to move about for genuine reasons (Tamil Nadu, “Stringent action against violators: DGP”, March 27). There are instances of cattle and poultry feed shops not opening for fear of a police crackdown. It is the same case with poultry shops. There are cases where one cannot make purchases without intense questioning or extreme police action. All this is leading to big losses for small-scale home entrepreneurs.

368,2020/03/28,Live online workshops a wonderful initiative during lockdown: Pullela Gopichand,"Sports Authority of India (SAI) has launched a series of live online workshops to engage athletes during the 21-day national lockdown

At a time when athletes have been restricted to their homes owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Sports Authority of India (SAI) has launched a series of live online workshops with experts in sports science and sports management to engage athletes and help them enhance their knowledge.

The workshop was launched by Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju on his Twitter account, where he invited everyone to join in the interesting sessions. The workshops are live from 11 am everyday, on all social media platforms of SAI.

The first session of the 24-series workshop started on Friday with renowned physiotherapist Nikhil Latey speaking about how to train at home during the time of corona which got over 8K views. This was followed by a session on nutritional requirements for athletes during corona pandemic by Ryan Fernando, which garnered more than 15K viewership from athletes, coaches and fitness enthusiasts.

Other speakers include national badminton coach Pullela Gopichand, former Indian hockey captain Viren Rasquinha and senior sports journalist Sharda Ugra, among many others.

The sessions are being attended by athletes and para athletes from all sport, including Olympic probables shooters Divyash Panwar, Apurvi Chandela, Abhishek Verma, boxer Lovlina Borgohain, Anish Bhanwala, Nikhat Zarin, swimmer Srihari Nataraj, among others.

Speaking about the sessions, Olympian Pooja Dhanda said, “The sessions are very informative. It helped me think differently about training while at home and helped me focus on key areas. I look forward to the other sessions as well.”

Praising the initiative and affirming the importance of being mentally and physically fit while being at home, Pullela Gopichand said, “It is a wonderful initiative taken by SAI. In these testing times with the coronavirus, it is important to keep oneself physically and mentally active and find ways to use our time better. These online sessions will certainly help in achieving that. Sport is not only about being competitive, challenges will be thrown up and it is how we face them with the best of our ability and keep moving forward that counts.”

Latey lauded SAI for taking up these online sessions and for reaching out to the athletes in these times, especially with the Olympics being postponed, saying: “These are uncertain times for athletes with the lockdown and suspension of training and events across the world. For a lot of us, the moment the lockdown is lifted, we can get back to doing what we do, but it’s not the same for athletes. They are unsure if they will be at the same level as they used to be in the absence of regular training and competition. This is why we need to come forward and help our athletes and make them utilise their time and these online sessions initiated by SAI are so useful. With the nationwide reach that SAI has, it will definitely have a positive impact.”

369,2020/03/28,Glimmer of hope: BMC plans community centres,"Homeless people left to fend for themselves in midst of crisis with no access to water, electricity

“We have always had a water problem, but it was never this bad,” says Radha Rajput, who lives with five other homeless families in Charni Road, adding that they were having to literally beg for water for their daily needs.

“Since the lockdown, only one toilet is open. That too for barely 30 minutes in the morning. As soon as the queue increases, they shut it down,” she said. Her story is similar to that of nearly one lakh people across the city, who do not have access to even basic needs such as water or electricity.

Brijesh Arya of the Beghar Adhikar Abhiyan said that homeless communities have been badly hit on several fronts. “While food is an issue, it is water that is a major concern. Most homeless people don’t have access to water and usually rely on local shops, railway stations, temples or mosques to cater to their daily needs. The other issue is toilets, as many have shut pay and use toilets out of fear,” Mr. Arya said

Jayashree Bhoj, additional municipal commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said they were planning to rehabilitate families in eight community centres spread across the city. She said schools were also being looked at a possibility by officers at various BMC wards.

Mr. Arya said he welcomed the move to rehabilitate the homeless but all of them should be provided with health check-ups once they were in the community centres or schools and proper social distancing should be facilitated. Sitaram Shelar from Centre for Promoting Democracy said they had come to know that at the ward level, efforts were being made to open up schools for the homeless as well. “We don’t want them to fill schools beyond a point as that would defeat the purpose. The other crucial thing they should take care of is that families should be rehabilitated together as a unit, with their belongings, and not be separated,” he said.

With the city staring at a 21 day lockdown, several prominent organisations have started mobilising resources to provide basic food items for the worst affected by the economic lockdown such as homeless communities and daily wage labourers, but faced major hurdles by way of mobility and travel restrictions.

According to the 2011 census, in Mumbai alone, the population of homeless is 57,415. Mr. Arya said that today the real number easily exceeds one lakh, most of whom depend on daily wage jobs, hawking or small businesses. Ms. Rajput said she and others were primarily in the business of stitching flowers for gajras and torans. “Our biggest day to earn is Gudi Padwa, where historically we earn at least ₹1,000. With that gone and all other avenues of income shut, we have literally nothing left,” she said.

‘Distribution an issue’

“Distribution is a major issue as homeless communities are scattered across the city in large and small clusters and in some cases it’s just individual families,” he said, adding that there could be as many as 300 clusters spread across the city.

“Communication is the other major issue as people living in these homeless communities used to charge their phones in shops. With the lockdown, several had been unable to charge their phones and we have lost touch with them,” he said. Since the lockdown, Mr. Arya, said that he had managed to visit a only a few homeless communities on Friday after nearly five days.

In some wards, BMC has also started to provide cooked meals to the homeless, but activists feel that that issue was spread across the city and needed a citywide response by the BMC or the State government till the lockdown was lifted.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/zgspp7/article31195487.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMHOMELESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/glimmer-of-hope-bmc-plans-community-centres/article31195488.ece
370,2020/03/28,3 held for hoarding hand sanitisers worth ₹2.5 lakh,"They were being sold on the black market at a higher price

The Mumbai Police Crime Branch has arrested three people who were allegedly hoarding hand sanitisers and selling them at increased rates on the black market.

According to Crime Branch officers, the goods were seized in a raid conducted on Friday, after the Unit VI received a tip-off about largescale hoarding of sanitisers. “Acting on the information received, Unit VI teams conducted a raid at a flat in Dinanath Wadi in Mahim, where two accused were found with the stash of hand sanitisers, which were being hoarded with the intent of creating a shortage in the market, and being sold at ₹65 a piece instead of the market value of ₹50 for each 100 ml bottle,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Detection I) Akbar Pathan said.

The two accused, identified as Viraj Dhariya (20) and Jainam Dedhiya (21), were arrested and their interrogation led the Crime Branch to a third accused, Neeraj Vyas (49). Mr. Vyas, who is allegedly the mastermind of the racket, was arrested from Mira Road and all the three were charged under the Essential Services Act.

“We have seized 5,000 bottles of hand sanitisers of 100 ml each, collectively worth ₹2.5 lakh, from the accused. Inquiries so far indicate that the accused obtained them from a company called Hindustan Chemicals and that the order was placed in the name of Curewell Medical and General Stores based in Juhu Koliwada,” Mr. Pathan said.

The police are still conducting inquiries to find out how long the racket has been active and how many hand sanitisers the accused have sold at enhanced rates during this time.

This is the Mumbai Police’s third operation against hoarding and sale of goods that have been classified as essential services by the government in light of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Earlier this week, the police had busted two rackets where facemasks were being hoarded and recovered facemasks worth crores of rupees.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/t0exub/article31195455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29bm-Crime,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3-held-for-hoarding-hand-sanitisers-worth-25-lakh/article31195457.ece
371,2020/03/28,"Mumbaikars open hearts, purse strings to help pavement dwellers, daily wagers","Food Packet Distribution drive has been reaching out to the underprivileged in 24 locations in the city since March 21

From collecting and dispersing food to approaching the State government with recommendations, Mumbaikars are doing their best to ease the pain of the underprivileged during the lockdown.

Ever since the novel coronavirus crisis broke out, numerous organisations and individuals have been distributing cooked or essential supplies to ensure that the underprivileged get at least two meals a day. The campaigns are being conducted at various locations all over the city in coordination with the authorities.

The Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH), a student Islamic organisation based in Mumbai, has started a Food Packet Distribution drive in 24 locations across the city since March 21. While the main objective of the initiative was to supply free food, many economically backward families were found to have run out of basic supplies, which the organisation has started providing.

Muzaffar Ansari, who is in charge of the initiative, said, “Our purpose is to serve people, as service to humanity is service to god in this critical time. With the help of the police, we distribute a minimum of 220 boxes of food and a maximum of 500 boxes every day.”

Over time, as people became aware of the initiative, donations started pouring in, with ₹1.60 lakh being donated from all over the city so far.

The JIH has also requested the State government to create a special fund in order to help labourers and workers in unorganised sectors. The letter, sent on March 22, urges Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to allocate some amount from the State budget and request industries to divert their corporate social responsibility donations of the first quarter to the pool.

“The State can also appeal to the people to chip in according to the requirement,” said Rizwan-ur-Rahman Khan, president of JIH Maharashtra.

Other than creation of the fund, the organisation suggested paying a compensation of ₹5,000 per month or providing food, water and shelter for free to approximately 3.65 crore unorganised daily wage earners in the State, starting from March. The letter also suggested that the compensation can be limited in the districts affected by COVID-19 that are under lockdown.

Similar initiatives are being conducted by other organisations in the city. The Raza Academy, for example, is providing food to the homeless who stay in railway stations.

“Food is a basic necessity for every human but due to the circumstances and conditions we live in currently, not everyone has access to this. We will be serving meals twice, at 1 p.m. and 8 p.m. for those in need,” Raza Academy founder Mohammed Saeed Noori said.

The menu consists of dal, jeera rice, a vegetable, chapattis and kheer and the organisation aims to reach out to 200 people every day.

The Round Table India, an NGO, is delivering groceries to senior citizens staying alone in Mumbai.

Vickaash Agarwal, head volunteer for the Maharashtra region said, “We started our services on March 24 and our basic motive is to help senior citizens living alone because they can’t stand in long queues outside departmental stores.”

The NGO is providing commodities like sugar, pulses, rice, dough and vermicelli. While the delivery is free, the groceries are charged according to the senior citizen’s economic status.

Individuals pitch in

Individuals have also contributed to the cause. Prabjoth Singh, a Sion-based actor, has along with his family and friends, been distributing free food to the homeless since March 22. The idea came up when the Gurudwara Shri Dashmesh Darbar was closed to avoid large gatherings in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, due to which the homeless people could not get food from the langar.

What started as a small venture with two cooks to feed 30 to 40 people has now turned into a food packet distribution, with meals being handed out twice a day.

“We cook nearly 60 to 70 kg of rice every day that feeds 100 to 200 people. We earlier served meals from home but have now started to distribute packets in places near our locality. We requested the gurudwara committee to lend us their large stoves and woks to make the meals, which they granted. It has helped us.”

What is also heartening is that people from then relatively socio-economic strata are also doing their bit. Mr. Singh recalled how, when he recently went to buy vegetables for his initiative, a vendor asked him why he needed 20 kg of tomatoes.

“On learning why, he insisted that I take 10 kg free of cost,” Mr. Singh said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/yrcmmt/article31195450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BM-food-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbaikars-open-hearts-purse-strings-to-help-pavement-dwellers-daily-wagers/article31195451.ece
372,2020/03/28,"Chaos reigns at APMC; threat to life, say traders","Threaten to discontinue operations

With nearly 1,200 trucks crowding the roads leading to the APMC market, traders unanimously decided to discontinue operations till the lockdown ends. “The crowd is unmanageable and our life is at risk. We have unanimously decided to not trade, but we leave it to individual choice. Each one has the freedom to trade, but most of us have decided to stay at home with our families,” said Shankar Pinglay, secretary of the market.

Usually, the number of trucks that enter the market is not more than 700. On Saturday morning, the roads leading to the market witnessed were clogged. “At least 20,000 people were present at the market with no protection today. We cannot risk our lives every day. The government has directed us to provide essentials and we have kept the market open. But we can’t work like this. There is shortage of labourers too,” a vegetable trader said.

Sanjay Pansare, secretary of the fruit market, said traders are not in favour of continuing operations. “To control such massive crowds, the Army will have to be called in. People are not worried about the novel coronavirus. No one will die if they don’t buy vegetables, they can still survive with pulses and grains. To get rid of the virus, one will have to control their taste buds for some time. This is going to be a long fight.”

Mr. Pansare said the government should declare a financial package for farmers who are facing losses. He said, “If the government makes the provision to run 400 distribution centres in Mumbai, then such crowds can be regulated. Government officers working from home can be deployed to take online orders of 15 housing societies in their area and forward it to the APMC for delivery.”

Meanwhile, Konkan divisional commissioner Shivaji Daund promised to find a way to keep the market functioning. NMMC Commissioner Annasaheb Misal also wrote to Mr. Daund suggesting a strategy to regularise crowds in the market.

Mr. Misal said, “On rotation basis, only 30% traders should work with adequate workers. Not more than 200 trucks should enter the market. Other trucks should be parked at checkpoints. When one truck leaves the market, another should be allowed to go ahead from the checkpoint. Social distancing has to be maintained at all times.”

Mr. Misal also suggested setting up checkpoints for trucks at Digha, Shilphata expressway, Uran, Vashi and Airoli.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/k471yc/article31195434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMAPMC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/chaos-reigns-at-apmc-threat-to-life-say-traders/article31195435.ece
373,2020/03/28,Labour shortage hits freight operations,"Two-fold problem: rakes awaiting unloading at destination and loading at source

Freight operations in the city have been affected due to an imbalance in the availability of labourers at loading and unloading points. The Railways and road authorities are bearing the brunt with a huge load of goods piling up.

A senior railway official said loading and unloading of goods such as coal and liquefied petroleum gas have not been affected much. He said, “The issue is with manual loading and unloading of goods such as grains, cement and fertilizers. Since they are essential items, we are working with local district authorities to ensure that the rakes are unloaded.”

According to sources, the problem is two-fold: at certain places, rakes are waiting to be unloaded; and rakes transporting goods such as foodgrains and cement are not being loaded at source.

A senior Central Railway (CR)official said two rakes carrying steel are waiting to be unloaded at Kalamboli, while six others are awaiting their turn. A senior Western Railway (WR) official said rakes carrying cement or foodgrains have not entered the city for nearly a week as they are not being loaded at source. Officials said transportation of cement was the worst-hit with a 90% dip in loading being recorded.

The lack of labour is also affecting container traffic. Abhishek Gupta of the Bombay Goods Transporters Association (BGTA) said several trucks are stranded in parking lots in Kalamboli and Vashi as there are no labourers to unload them. He said, “Drivers can’t leave trucks unless they are unloaded. As they have already reached their destination, they won’t be paid for spending extra time there. Moreover, the situation at the parking lots is terrible as drivers don’t have access to food or water.”

Shalabh Goel, divisional railway commissioner, Mumbai Division, CR, said loading had dipped at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust too due to labour shortage. The Railways has suspended all passenger traffic, leaving only freight trains running. He said, “Mumbai has a unique geography and we have had to arrange cars to transport loco pilots and assistant loco pilots to the starting points of freight trains as many live in different parts of the city.” CR had surpassed its freight target of 2019-20 of ₹1,822.56 crore by March 25.

The lockdown has also affected parcel traffic, which used to be transported via passenger trains. Senior officials said medical items were often sent via parcel vans as they required low volume and had high value. Now, CR and WR have decided to run dedicated parcel trains.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ns6g9p/article31195383.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMAPMC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/labour-shortage-hits-freight-operations/article31195384.ece
374,2020/03/28,Tempo mows down 4 migrant workers heading home on foot,"Bikers chase vehicle, hand over errant driver to police

Four migrant workers were killed and three others were injured when a tempo ran over them on the Virar stretch of the Mumbai–Gujarat Highway on Saturday.

The Virar police said the incident occurred at 3 a.m. at Bhoral village when the migrant workers were heading to their native villages in Rajasthan on foot. The police said the tempo sped away and passing motorists arranged for ambulances to rush the injured to hospitals.

“Two bikers who saw the accident chased the tempo and caught the driver, Ranjeet Singh Thakur (34). They later handed him over to us,” an officer with the Virar police said.

375,2020/03/28,Police trace starving handloom workers after video goes viral,"Officers swing into action, provide food items to sustain 30 families for a few days

The Bhoiwada police on Saturday traced a group of 30 starving handloom workers in Bhiwandi after their video went viral on WhatsApp and arranged food for them for the next few days. However, they are still looking for a long-term solution.

According to police officials, the video showed the labourers sitting with masks at a safe distance from each other while one of them described their plight in Hindi. Hundreds of daily wagers in the handloom town of Bhiwandi have been struggling to make ends meet after the State went into lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Grabbing attention

The widely circulated video caught the attention of the Bhoiwada police around 10.30 a.m. Senior police inspector K.A. Kapre said, “We traced the workers by circulating the information to constables at the station. Contacting and locating the handloom workers took 45 minutes. We then contacted the owner of the mill and got in touch with Nirman, a local NGO, to provide them with immediate relief.”

By 12.30 p.m., sufficient dal and rice to last for a few days were handed over to the 30 workers, who mostly hail from Bihar and Jharkhand and live in Razzak compound on Kariwali road.

Mujim Ansari, the sole earner in his family of five, said, “We are grateful to the police for their quick response. We haven’t been given a permanent solution yet, but I am happy that my family has food to sustain ourselves for a short while.”

Police officials said they are awaiting a response from the employer to work out a long-term solution for the handloom workers.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pa8kf5/article31195318.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMPolice-distribute-food,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/police-trace-starving-handloom-workers-after-video-goes-viral/article31195319.ece
376,2020/03/28,Man’s phone call sends police on wild goose chase,"Bhiwandi resident’s claims of seeing triple murder and bodies being taken to hospital turn out to be false

The Narpoli police in Bhiwandi on Friday arrested a 50-year-old man for allegedly making a hoax call about a triple murder, which put half the police station staff to work in these already stressful times. The accused, who was being questioned till night, could not even give a coherent reason behind his action.

The Thane Police control room received a call at 1 a.m., with a Marathi-speaking man claiming that he had seen three people getting murdered in Bhiwandi. The caller told the control room officer that the victims were two women and a man, and that their bodies were being taken in a private vehicle to Ashirwad Hospital in Kamatghar, Bhiwandi.

“We sent teams to the hospital but could not find any evidence to support his claims. We also searched the entire premises with the same result. We then started looking for the vehicle that the caller had mentioned, as he had given us the licence plate number as well,” Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajkumar Shinde, Zone II, Thane Police, said.

After a while, the vehicle was found parked close to the hospital but no signs of bodies having been ferried in it were found.

The police then obtained the location of the caller’s number and found him in the same vicinity. He was identified as Mahadev Chevle (50), a resident of Brahmanand Nagar in Bhiwandi. Mr. Chevle was taken to Narpoli police station and questioned. Despite extensive inquiries, the police have not found any motive or even a link between him and the vehicle in question, so far.

“Mr. Chevle keeps claiming that he finds it funny to put government servants to work, and that he had similarly targeted other police personnel and civic officials in the past,” Mr. Shinde said.

The police arrested Mr. Chevle and charged him with providing false information to a government servant under the Indian Penal Code.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ej43ny/article31188229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bmprankcall,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mans-phone-call-sends-police-on-wild-goose-chase/article31188227.ece
377,2020/03/28,"As more trucks enter, APMC staff struggle to keep market sanitised","Extra security guards, police personnel hired for bandobast

The planning of the APMC authorities along with government officials to get the market in Vashi sanitised and run it in a safe way went for a toss after 513 vegetable trucks rolled in along with purchasers on Friday. The idea was to have lesser number of vehicles, not exceeding 150, which could be managed well in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Kailas Tajne, a vegetable vendor, said there were at least 5,000 buyers and 2,000 traders at the market. “When farmers send their produce, we can’t say no to them. The control room set up to tackle the issues is located in the head office. The officers who are supposed to be in the field are not available at 2 a.m. when the market opens.”

Anil Chavan, secretary of APMC, said they were expecting only 200 trucks. “But since the market was shut and there was excess stock with farmers, many of them sent across. Usually traders call for the stock as per requirement, but some of the farmers sent even without asking for it and we could not deny them. We had planned to take in the vehicles only till 4 a.m., but it went on till 6 a.m..”

From Saturday, Mr. Chavan said, they had planned to allow 100 vehicles at a time to avoid crowding. “Meanwhile, we have hired an additional 50 security guards and have also received extra policemen for bandobast.”

The police have been doing their job well but overcrowding puts management off track, said Ashok Shiledar, a mathadi worker. “Only 20 % of the mathadi workers are available for work. We are hungry; we are not provided with snacks and tea.”

Traders have also claimed that the sanitisers had gone out of stock and after a point, sanitisation of the vehicles and men were stopped.

Konkan divisional commissioner Shivaji Daund said, “From Saturday, around 100 policemen will be available for bandobast. The unexpected crowd poses a challenge. Things will be better from Saturday.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ymcdep/article31188220.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bmApmc,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/as-more-trucks-enter-apmc-staff-struggle-to-keep-market-sanitised/article31188219.ece
378,2020/03/28,130 booked for travelling in vehicles meant for essential services,"The Navi Mumbai Police on Friday booked over 130 people for allegedly trying to travel hiding in vehicles meant for essential services at Vashi toll naka, Nawde phata at Taloja, and on the Sion-Panvel highway near McDonald’s at Kalamboli.

Senior police inspector Sanjeev Dhumal said the people, who wanted to go to their home towns, were found hiding in the vehicles though it seemed as if they were carrying essential goods. “We are blocking all vehicles and asking them to go back and only those with essential commodities are allowed to pass. Police personnel are deployed at Vashi toll naka round the clock. People need to understand the seriousness of the novel coronavirus outbreak and stop venturing out.”

The four vehicles caught at Vashi naka were two tempos, one ambulance and one truck. Fifty-one passengers along with the drivers were booked. The ambulance owner, Tanaji Balwant, from Curry road had planned to go to Kolhapur along with his wife and child, and let six passengers travel in it.

At Nawde phata in Taloja, the police found 14 people travelling in a truck from Dombivali to Satara and four in a car. “The truck had delivered sugar and on its return was carrying passengers in the name of supplying essential services. The truck had five men, three children, and six women. The four in the car from Khedukpada were loitering around the node,” Kashinath Chavan, senior police inspector of Taloja police station, said.

The Kalamboli police found 63 people in seven vehicles, including an ambulance, milk delivery van, tempo, truck, and autorickshaw. They were on their way to Phaltan in Satara and Karnataka.

All of them were booked under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), and 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule) of the Indian Penal Code, and sections of the Motor Vehicle Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/four-vehicles-intercepted-for-ferrying-people-130-booked/article31188165.ece
379,2020/03/28,Grandson of Vashi mosque secretary youngest victim,"Raigad district’s first patient discharged

The youngest patient to test positive for COVID-19 in Maharashtra is a two-and-half-a-year-old-boy, grandson of the Vashi mosque’s secretary, who was in direct contact with a Filipino, the index patient of Navi Mumbai.

The 59-year-old Islamic scholar from the Philipines along with nine others had visited the mosque from March 10 to 12. While welcoming him, the secretary had hugged him. “Later, the Filipino was inside his room as he was feeling unwell,” Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) Commissioner Annasaheb Misal said. The scholar succumbed at Powai’s Hiranandani Hospital on Sunday.

While the secretary (57) tested positive on March 24, his son and domestic help were found positive the next day. On Friday morning, his grandson too tested positive.

“We have also quarantined 53 people who had visited the mosque for namaaz on the day when the Filipino was present. As of now no one has showed any symptoms. The four cleaners of the mosque also underwent a test and their reports came negative,” Mr. Misal said.

Meanwhile, the index patient of Raigad district, a Kamothe resident (63), was discharged from Kasturba Hospital on Thursday.

Under the Panvel Municipal Corporation, the number of home-quarantined is 231, while 212 travellers have completed 14-day quarantine. Twenty-four people have been referred to Kasturba, while the current positive case is one, reports of 22 have come negative and that of one is awaited.

Similarly, under the NMMC, 690 are on home quarantine, 33 travellers have completed 14-day quarantine, and eight are in Kasturba while six are in Vashi NMMC hospital. The number of positive cases is eight, while 12 have tested negative and reports of eight are awaited.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/grandson-of-vashi-mosque-secretary-youngest-victim/article31188160.ece
380,2020/03/28,Maker’s Asylum develops face shields for healthcare workers,"Aims to distribute 10,000 units of the protective gear

While citizens clapped and beat utensils to encourage healthcare workers on Sunday, two members of Maker’s Asylum decided to quarantine themselves at the community hackerspace in Andheri, to produce protective gear for healthcare professionals.

In the past two days, founder of Maker’s Asylum Vaibhav Chhabra and lab head Narender Sharma, have designed affordable face shields for frontline healthcare professionals, like doctors, nurses and people conducting COVID-19 tests, which can be produced rapidly on a mass scale across the country.

Made of acrylic, foam, OHP sheets and elastic bands, the face shield is reusable and weighs less than 25 gm. The transparent OHP sheets can be replaced quickly, has hinges to fit all head sizes and the face shield can be assembled in less than three minutes. “We provide extra sheets along with the shield to replace whenever required, and it has ventilation holes so it can be worn all day,” said Richa Shrivastava Chhabra, managing partner, Maker’s Asylum.

Worn over a mask, face shields can be used to protect healthcare and sanitary workers from splashes, sprays and splatter of body fluids like mucous and saliva on the facial area, further reducing the chances of contracting coronavirus. The makerspace aims to produce and distribute over 10,000 face shields to government hospitals and doctors for free, for which they are raising funds online, in order to procure raw materials. “The requirement for these protective gears will soon reach more than a lakh and besides these 10,000 masks, we have orders from private individuals and hospitals too,” said Ms. Shrivastava Chhabra. The face shield is estimated to cost Rs. 100 each.

With a 21-day lockdown in India, the biggest challenge is to transport these face shields to several parts of the country. “So the idea was to come up with a standard product and not produce them centrally but everywhere, and not deal with the logistics of distribution,” said Ms. Shrivastava Chhabra. They plan to collaborate with labs and over 500 hackerspaces across India to produce these face shields and distribute them regionally.

Initially, Mr. Chhabra and Mr. Sharma, developed the shields using 3D printers, which took longer to manufacture. So they decided to use laser cutters or digital fabrication to quicken the process. The makerspace can now cut the acrylic headgear in less than a minute and make up to 500 a day. “In India, we need to make COVID-19 testing more aggressive, and for that, we will need adequate protection,” said Ms. Shrivastava Chhabra.

Labs and makerspaces who have laser cutting machines and want to help manufacture and distribute the face shields locally, as well as those interested in buying the face shields from Maker’s Asylum, can contact them at info@makersasylum.com or call on 9004686828.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/k2nm00/article31188150.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BM-mask,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/makers-asylum-develops-face-shields-for-healthcare-workers/article31188133.ece
381,2020/03/28,Coronavirus lockdown | Maharashtra seeks Army’s help,"Three locations in Mumbai identified for emergency isolation wards

Maharashtra has sought the help and support of the Army to ensure free movement of essential goods across the State, and also in providing medical infrastructure. Senior officials said while the Army has not been summoned yet, the government is in touch with the Southern Command headquarters, Pune, for any assistance during the 21-day period.

Topping the State’s help list is assistance with medical infrastructure, said officials. “We have written to them and are in touch with them [Army] on various issues, most importantly for safe transport of essential commodities in sensitive areas, and construction of emergency infrastructure,” said a senior official from the Chief Minister’s Office.

Government officials have held meetings with the Army and identified three locations in Mumbai to set up emergency isolation wards. “We are prepared to tackle any emergency. If the number of positive patients goes up we can start isolation wards immediately at Bombay Exhibition Centre, Goregaon; another ground at Worli; and the Convention Centre at Bandra Kurla Complex. We have extra 500 beds in JJ Hospital, GT hospital and St George hospital,” said Cabinet Minister and Mumbai’s Guardian Minister Aslam Sheikh.

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar confirmed the State has written to the Army but it is limited to asking for only medical help. The Government has not yet summoned the forces. However if the situation persists, and further assistance is needed the government will not hesitate to summon the Army, he said.

‘Show restraint’

Earlier, the DCM had appealed to the people and the State police to show restraint during the 21-day nationwide lockdown. He said if clashes between people and the police do not stop, the government may be forced to call in the Army. “I appeal to all, please don't force us to call the military to take charge,” he had said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6wej4m/article31188109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMMIGRANTWORKER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/lockdown-state-seeks-armys-help/article31188053.ece

Citizens’ group Aamchi Mumbai Aamchi BEST has urged the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking to convert its depots into distribution centres for food, water and medicines.

In a letter to BEST committee chairman Anil Patankar, the group also asked the BEST to provide safety kits to its staff and explore the option of using buses to deliver essential items. Since the start of the lockdown, the BEST has been the city’s only transport provider.

Along with the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation, it has been plying buses on limited routes and catering to people providing essential services. On Friday, it ran 1,674 buses of the scheduled 3,073 buses. Mr. Patankar said there were plans of converting the depots into relief centres, but there has been no official word or directive regarding the suggestion. “If the need arises, we will definitely pursue it,” he said.

In the letter, the citizens’ collective said the city’s 27 bus depots were large open spaces that could be used for the delivery of aid. It also said several marginalised groups in the city have had to bear the brunt of the 21-day lockdown. They are surviving without any source of income and their food stocks are depleting, it said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/best-urged-to-turn-depots-into-aid-disbursal-centres/article31188006.ece

384,2020/03/28,"BMC reaches out to donors for safety gear, oxygen cylinders","Most cases at peripheral hospitals, but supply going to major hospitals: civic officials

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has appealed to corporates and individuals to donate personal protective equipment (PPE) to meet the needs of its municipal hospitals. The BMC also requires more oxygen cylinders for the isolation centres it is setting up.

Vishwas Mote, assistant municipal commissioner, said, “We want PPE, Azithromycin 500mg, food packets, and ventilators. Donors can get in touch with me at Andheri Sports Complex.”

According to BMC data, its municipal hospital stores have 50 oxygen cylinders, while the requirement is 555; only 3,742 PPEs against the requirement of 35,000; and just 65,293 N95 masks though the need is 1,15,800. There is sufficient stock of Gamex gloves, Nitrile gloves, 3-ply masks, ventilators and hand sanitisers, but due to lack of coordination between hospital management and contractors, it has not yet reached the stores.

Civic hospitals place orders with the BMC’s central purchase department (CPD) and the contractor makes the delivery. Despite complaints of shortage of N95 masks and gloves, the department said as on March 27, it has enough stock. However, there is stock of only 35,000 PPEs and no surplus.

A senior CPD official said, “There is no shortage at all, but we are hoping to receive more PPEs soon through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. In some cases, since trucks are stranded on the State’s borders, contractors have not been able to make deliveries. We have intervened and ensured their release.”

Deputy municipal commissioner (health) Ramesh Pawar denied reports of shortage of masks. He said, “It is not so. Today, we held a meeting with all medical superintendents and deans, and have given them a free hand. Vendors and systems are in place. They can place orders and take whatever they need. CSR is just a bonus and we depend on it only for 10% requirement.”

On hospitals not yet receiving supplies, Mr. Pawar said, “It is the job of the medical superintendent to make purchases and ours to make them available. They will not face any shortage. The major hospitals don’t have a single COVID-19 patient. All are at peripheral hospitals, but the supply is going to major hospitals.”

Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “In Kasturba Hospital, we have 1,500 PPEs, sufficient N95 masks, and 17 jumbo oxygen cylinders. We have placed orders for 555 cylinders and so far 50 have been delivered. They will be used for peripheral hospitals, where we are setting up 1,030 isolation beds. Those will be delivered by March 30.”

‘Adequate supply’

On the lack of co-ordination, Mr. Kakani said, “We have assigned CPD staff in major hospitals to issue orders, obtain signatures, ensure supply and payment. Only those treating patients should wear PPE, but when doctors are working in three shifts, we are providing 100 PPE daily. Kasturba Hospital has 1,500 PPE. We have adequate supply and hospitals should use them judiciously. Shortfall is there because there is a strain on manufacturers, but we have planned up to April 30.”

In a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday, the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) had highlighted the risk medical students are facing due to lack of PPE. MARD said five medical students, who worked at the international airport, SevenHills and Kasturba hospitals, were quarantined for having COVID-19 symptoms.

Dr. Shariva Randive of MARD said, “The letter made a difference. There are enough masks and PPE now. We are now working with the government.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/qpjfc4/article31187958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bmstockcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bmc-reaches-out-to-donors-for-safety-gear-oxygen-cylinders/article31187959.ece

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has appealed to all persons back from foreign travel since January, and yet to be tested for novel coronavirus, to voluntarily come forward and get themselves tested irrespective of whether they are displaying symptoms or not.

The appeal comes following a letter by the Union Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba to Chief Secretaries of all States to check on those who have returned between January 18 and March 23.

An 85-year-old surgeon with Saifee Hospital is likely the latest COVID-19 casualty in Mumbai. The doctor was rushed to PD Hinduja Hospital in Mahim on Thursday and died within hours of admission. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is verifying the test reports before labelling it as a COVID-19 death as the test was carried out at a private laboratory.

According to a civic official, the doctor’s grandson had returned from the U.K. on March 14. On Wednesday, the family called a private testing facility to collect samples of the surgeon and his grandson from their home. On Thursday, the surgeon complained of breathlessness and was rushed to Saifee Hospital, where a chest CT scan was carried out and he was kept in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Doctors suspected COVID-19, and the report from the private lab arrived at the same time, confirming the surgeon and the grandson had the virus. Both were taken to Hinduja Hospital, which has a designated isolation facility.

Meanwhile, the surgeon’s son, also a doctor at Saifee, tested positive on Friday. Samples of four other family members have been sent for testing. The surgeon was buried at Charni Road. Health officials said he was a diabetic and had a pacemaker.

Sources said the son, a cardiac surgeon, conducted consultations and surgeries through the week. Civic officials have sent samples of 14 staff members, including other doctors, operation theatre staff and his patients, for testing.

According to sources at Saifee Hospital, the CT scan and X-Ray facilities on the second floor, and the ICU on the fifth floor have been shut for disinfection.

A doctor said the hospital already had a reduced OPD load due to the lockdown, and only the emergency department was functional. Director Dr. Vernon Desa said in a statement that all containment and surveillance measures have been implemented. “Saifee Hospital reiterates that the hospital is fully operational,” he said.

The city is facing a stiff challenge in its fight against COVID-19 with the virus entering densely populated slums and chawls where social distancing is impractical.

M East ward, known for its poor socio-economic conditions, has reported 10 positive cases. The civic officials are now facing an uphill task of tracking their contact history in the cramped area. It comprises Govandhi, Deonar, Baiganwadi, Mankhurd, Shivaji Nagar, Cheetah Camp and a part of Chembur.

A 48-year-old cleric from Baiganwadi in Govandi was the first to test positive on March 23. He had travelled to Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. Besides his daily interactions at a local mosque, which has now been sealed, he had offered namaz at Lotus Colony, where one person later tested positive for COVID-19.

In another case reported from Cheetah Camp, a man who returned from Dubai tested positive. His wife’s sample returned negative and she is now under home quarantine. The sample of a 65-year-old woman from Plot no. 10 in Govandi, who died of severe complications on Thursday, also tested positive. Of the 10 cases, some are close contacts of patients with a travel history. In one case, the patient’s travel history or contact has not yet been established.

‘Lockdown ineffective’

A civic official said the houses in chawls are located close to each other and the huge population results in a positive patient coming into contact with a large number of people. A local resident of Govandi said though there is concern over the rise in cases, the lockdown has not been effective in the area. He said, “Everyone is seen sitting outside in groups. No one is paying heed to the police’s constant announcements to stay indoors.”

Local MLA Abu Azmi said he had enlisted volunteers to go around in autorickshaws and make announcements urging people to stay at home. He said, “Everything is being done, but it’s still difficult to keep people inside their homes. The poorest in the area have large families and small houses.”

In Jambhlipada slum in Kalina, a man who returned from Italy tested positive and a local doctor he had consulted also tested positive this week. As of Friday, the civic health officials have sent 57 people for testing, including close contacts of the man who returned from Italy and the doctor who has a thriving practice in the area. Though the man consulted the doctor on March 19, the doctor continued to see patients till March 23. He also visited a small hospital in the area where he attended to patients. Local corporator Tulip Miranda is now taking steps to spread awareness of the disease in the area.

390,2020/03/28,24-year-old good Samaritan stabbed in Mumbai,"The Pydhonie police have launched a manhunt for two inidentified men who allegedly stabbed a 24- year-old Pydhonie resident near his house on Friday morning.

According to the Pydhonie police the incident happened on the the Chakla Street in Pydhonie at around 10 a.m. on Friday. The police said that Mohammed Syed (24), a resident of the area was distributing tea and biscuits among daily wage labourers who sleep on the pavement in the locality.

391,2020/03/28,COVID-19: Shirdi Trust to donate ₹51 crore,"The Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust in Shirdi in Ahmednagar district has announced it would give ₹51 crore to the State government to augment its efforts to combat COVID-19. On Friday, the trust’s CEO Arun Dongre said the ad hoc committee of the trust has decided to donate ₹51 crore to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.

“The Central and State governments have geared up to take on the novel coronavirus which is wreaking havoc all over the world. The trust has always come forward to help both governments in times of natural calamities and national disasters,” Mr. Dongre said, recalling the trust’s contributions at the time of the deluge in western Maharashtra last year as well as towards the families of the soldiers martyred in the Pulwama terror strike.

In the backdrop of surging COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra, the trust has already commenced activities to bring relief to personnel such as district police personnel and other workers on the frontlines of the fight against the virus by providing them with food packets for breakfast and lunch.

Meanwhile, the Temple Management Trust in Kolhapur, which manages the famous Mahalaxmi Temple, has announced a donation of ₹2 crore, of which ₹1.5 crore would be given to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund in the State’s fight against COVID-19.

392,2020/03/28,Cultivating a rice-eating habit amid Coronavirus lockdown,"Spirit of the Earth wants people to share heritage rice recipes on Instagram, to understand mindful eating and immunity building

“Research says it takes 21 days to form a new habit. We have 21 days at home — yes, it’s a lockdown, but it’s also an opportunity to reflect on our lifestyle, and understand the impact of it on our health, environment and community at large,” says Jayanthi Somasundaram of Chennai-based Spirit of the Earth, an organisation which focusses on conservation and cultivation of heritage produce.

Spirit of the Earth is now encouraging everyone to share recipes that use heritage rice via Instagram, which they will in turn post on their Instagram handle, @spirit_of_the_earth_2017. With the focus being on mindful eating and immunity building during the lockdown, information on the rice used for each dish will also be shared.

The visual stories to be shared for the next 21 days will revolve around three major themes.

The first will be what heritage rice actually is — What have you tried? Is it healthy? Is it easy to cook? Is it tasty? Why should one opt for heritage rice, over the polished hybrid variant?

The second will be mindful living — Where does your food come from? Have you been to a farm? Do you know a farmer? What are the native varieties of crops? Is organic really helpful for the soil?

The third will be immunity-building foods — What are the colours on my plate? Is more colour healthier? Can rice build immunity? How much rice should I have for each meal? What can I make with the rice water?

“The recipe has to be something simple, nothing too fancy. We believe these stories will encourage conversation in so many homes,” Jayanthi says, adding, “Change may not come right away, but these conversations will certainly strike a chord. Once people are aware of what they are buying, where they buy, what they eat and how they live — they will evolve from mere consumers to contributors to society.”

As many families are spending mealtime together, there is a surge of interest in cooking healthy meals. At this time, Jayanthi says they hope to introduce people to native varieties of rice, which are not just healthier, but also better for the planet. “At our 50-acre agricultural land in Manjakudi, near Tanjore, we cultivate close to 40 different varieties of heritage rice, and are constantly striving to revive more varieties,” she says.

Wide range

When it comes to heritage rice, each variety has a unique taste, aroma and property. Fragrant ones include gobindobhog, ajara ghansal, katarni, sukhdas and iluppai poo champa. From the farming perspective, rice varieties can be classified into kuruvai (short duration crop, 60 to 90 days) and champa (long duration crop, 120 to 130 days).

“We have certain rice varieties that are best suited for making idli and dosa — garudan champa, poongar, kullakar, iluppai poo champa, thooyamalli and navara. For preparing traditional snacks like murukku and thattai, we recommend thooyamalli, perungar or ramakali rice. This is the best season to make vathal and vadams, and for that thengapoo champa is best suited,” Jayanthi says.

She adds, “This activity is for people to understand that simple changes in lifestyle can bring about much bigger changes too. We think this is the time when people are going to think about life and reflect on their choices, and hopefully make better decisions at the end of the 21 days.”

393,2020/03/28,COVID-19: Good samaritan reaches out with food for the displaced during the lockdown in Kochi,"PA Mary Anitha is providing food for street dwellers, migrant workers and the policemen on duty during the Coronavirus lockdown in Kochi

“If it was to feed people in distress for a day I would make biriyani. But this has to go on for 21 days till the lockdown is over,” says PA Mary Anitha who is leading a community-feeding programme in Kochi. Along with a team of volunteers, she is providing food packets for street dwellers, migrant workers and the policemen on duty. A clinical psychologist, Mary founded the Centre For Empowerment and Enrichment in 2007 and opened branches in Ernakulam, Thiruvanathpuram and Malappuram.

“I began this centre mainly to bring the needs of differently abled children into the forefront,” says Mary, who also started a project called ‘Unity Me’ that focuses on their medical and financial needs.

During the 2018 Kerala floods, Mary opened a kitchen that cooked and served food for nearly 2,000 people in different relief camps. With a network of friends and volunteers, she even reached out to remote areas in Wayanad. As soon as the Coronavirus scare began and restrictions in movement were imposed, Mary was quick to connect with her network.

“We have to be careful of personal distancing and not assemble in one place, so I had to work out another strategy,” says Mary who cooks for a 100 people daily and organises food packets through her network for another 200.

She recalls the first day, March 12, when she began providing snacks for the policeman on duty at Vyttila junction. “While all the focus goes to people who are in distress, we tend to overlook the caregivers and the people behind the scenes. Our policemen are working round the clock to serve us, so I began with them.”

Her two food distribution points for migrants and street dwellers are at Kaloor and Ernakulam Boat Jetty. Mary not only provides food but also ensures that every person receiving taking a parcel washes his/her hand thoroughly and uses hand sanitiser. “We have to make them aware of the importance of this habit too,” she says.

Her network of volunteers was built through her three counselling centres, which have 3720 families registered. The families of the special children help her cook, collect and deliver food. She also has the support of her family - husband and three children - in her work.

This operation required careful planning. “I have data on the numbers of people who need food. Without that I would not know how much food to organize.” According to her, there are 126 slums in Ernakulam district, 32 in Kochi city and approximately 800 migrant workers. At Kaloor, she provides 225 food packets and 100 at the Boat Jetty.

The menu is simple: rice and green gram gruel while the policemen get banana fry, bread roll or kolkuttas for snacks . Another social group, FACE, sponsors tea.

Mary has been working closely with the police force for past several years, addressing them on subjects like psychology, “mostly on stress relief”, motivational talks and sensitisation.

394,2020/03/28,Karnataka a forerunner in COVID-19 prevention and patient care,"The impact of COVID-19 may be far too many on people in various walks of life and one among them is the manner in which the fear of the virus causing the disease has brought all political parties and politicians together across the nation and particularly in Karnataka which has emerged a forerunner in prevention and care.

Politicians here are together with very little heard of their dissent, if any, against the ruling leaders who are doing their best in providing healthcare facilities apart from preventing the spread of the disease. Healthcare is a State subject and Karnataka has done well in its preparations to face the onslaught of the virus, and one of the State’s oldest hospital, the Victoria Hospital, has been modified overnight to handle all the infected patients.

With the Bharatiya Janata Party ruling in the State as is the case at the Centre, it is obvious that the government of B.S. Yediyurappa has been abiding by the guidelines and advisories of the Centre in letter and spirit. But then the local situations warrant some new features whether it be in an effective closure of public places or social distancing and it is here that the government needs the support of the people and their political representatives.

While political leaders discussed the preventive steps to be taken against the disease during the recent session of the State legislature, what has been missing in recent days is a meeting of all political leaders which would be appropriate at the present juncture. The need for calling an all-party meeting by the BJP government in Karnataka to enable all the political parties to come together, in the effort to counter the challenges posed of the virus, may perhaps yield optimum dividends.

The newly appointed president of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee D.K. Shivakumar told The Hindu, “We appreciate all that is being done to prevent the spread of the disease and the healthcare being provided to people. However, the State government should have the courtesy to discuss with the Opposition leaders and also update them on the prevailing situation”.

Incidentally, most of the Ministers in the Yediyurappa Cabinet are also unaware of the situation and the decisions being taken although there is very little that they can do, which, incidentally, calls for expertise . It is only the Chief Minister and two Ministers concerned with healthcare who are believed to be involved in the decisions, apart from some select officials of the government. A notable feature, however, is that there are several medical experts who are being consulted and the decision to set apart the Victoria Hospital to provide appropriate care for the infected persons was owing to their suggestion. Karnataka was one of the first States in the country to set apart a major medical facility for COVID-19 patients.

It is said that the elected or public representatives have a very limited role in the present situation and there is no requirement for any consultation to arrive at policy decisions. At best, it would only be prudent for the government to convey its decisions to the elected representatives and videoconferences are the only way since an assembly of people could have a serious effect.

395,2020/03/28,"Go, Corona, go: The land of the holy cow shall not be cowed down by a virus","Even without any virus threat, clapping, conch-blowing, and utensil-hitting are known to improve blood circulation, enhance digestion, and increase your attractiveness, not just to the opposite sex but the entire spectrum of LGBTQIA+

First of all, I want to thank all 130 crore of my fellow Indians for expressing their gratitude to me last Sunday. It was amazing. At a personal level, as someone who has been striving day and night to combat the superstitions around the COVID-19 pandemic, I was deeply touched by your appreciation, and positively infected by your enthusiasm.

As soon as I stepped into my Wuhan-facing balcony at 5 p.m., the entire nation erupted in thunderous applause, thanking me for my selfless service at this critical time. Not only were people clapping, ringing bells, and clanging kadais, many courageous souls also took out a procession, cocking a snook at coronavirus. I think this was very much needed, and I can’t emphasise enough the significance of sending out a strong message to all our enemies: the land of the holy cow shall not be cowed down by a virus.

Unfortunately, while most Indians got the symbolism behind the gesture, far too many remain ignorant of the science behind the 5 p.m. plate-banging. First of all, as renowned vedic microbiologist Vijay Dinanath Chauhan pointed out in a tweet, March 22 was Amavasya, the darkest day of the month. This was the day when the evil force of the SARS CoV-2 virus was at its peak. And that’s precisely why it was a complete masterstroke by our PM to get the entire country to do Thali Bajao. As per line 28, chapter 56, verse 112 of the Rig Veda, the vibrations thus produced would considerably weaken the virus since the moon was, at that very moment, passing to the Revathi nakshatra.

Miraculous properties

Moreover, even without any virus threat, clapping, conch-blowing, and utensil-hitting are known to improve blood circulation, enhance digestion, and increase your attractiveness, not just to the opposite sex but the entire spectrum of LGBTQIA+. So I request everyone to stop advertising their ignorance by criticising the #Thali Bajao PR campaign.

Now let me come to the main point. Having done more than any other expert to spread authentic information about COVID-19, I recognise the importance of timely communication packed with the right kind of content. So I shall take this opportunity to dispel the other big myths around the pandemic and inculcate the correct mindset among my brothers and sisters so that, together, we can present our beloved leader with the ultimate gift: a resounding victory over coronavirus.

Myth #1: It is the government’s responsibility to protect you from COVID-19.

Fact: It is actually your responsibility to protect the government’s image from COVID-19.

Explanation: Please understand that you are not in Scandinavia. You are living in the world’s largest democracy, which means it is the responsibility of every citizen to protect the image of the leaders whom they have wilfully voted to power. Our beloved leader has already spoken to each one of you more than once in the past 10 days, that too on national television. He has explained everything. So instead of asking 10,000 questions – why aren’t we testing more, where is protective gear for doctors, what are the poor going to do, etc. – use your pranic energy to convince the virus to stop acting like a Pakistan-funded terrorist. Pick up a thali, grab a karandi, and keep banging the former with the latter while chanting the cosmic mantra, “Go, Corona, go!” until either the thali breaks or Corona goes.

Myth #2: The government has imposed a lockdown in order to stop the spread of the virus.

Fact: The lockdown is to help you know thyself.

Explanation: “All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone,” noted the 17th-century French mathematician Blaise Pascal. If what Pascal said was theory, the past week in India has been the ‘practicals’. We’ve all had to sit quietly in a room, alone. This is that rare moment in history when you can make a lasting contribution to your species, prove yourself a patriot, and win points for being selfless and civic-minded by doing what you want to do every single day of your life but can’t: stay in bed all day.

That’s not all. This lockdown is the starting point of an adventurous journey of self-discovery. I know of people who buy expensive tickets to go and do in a Cambodian monastery what anyone can now do sitting at home: contemplate the meaning of life.

In fact, I’ve reason to believe that most coronaviruses are motivated by nothing more than a desire to see all of humanity practise dynamic meditation. “Know thyself”, said Plato. Now is your chance to spend some quality time with yourself. What’s more, you can do so without loss of pay. Make the most of it.

Myth #3: You are being urged to wash your hands frequently because soap kills the virus.

Fact: Washing your hands frequently helps you appreciate how your government resolves every problem.

Explanation: Rinse and repeat.

Prophetic: “When I was a little boy, a man read my palm. He said that my life will take the course of Nature.”

Simple start: I belong to the Mising tribe, an indigenous community inhabiting parts of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

Eureka moment: My green journey began in 1978, when I was 16. The floods washed away homes leaving behind sand. My parents went away to another village, but I stayed behind. Snakes came into the open in the wake of the floods, but they died owing to the heat on the sandbar. I thought the village too would die like the snakes.

One-man army: For the next 15 years, I lived alone and planted saplings. Gradually the sandbar transformed into a 550-hectare forest, and is now named Molai forest after Payeng.

Life: I live in a small hut in the forest with my wife Binita and three children. I keep cattle and buffaloes and the money I make from selling the milk provides me with an income.

Villains: Sometime back, I lost around 100 of my cows and buffaloes to the tigers in the forest. But I don’t blame the animals. I blame the people who encroach and destroy the forests forcing animals to do this.

Genre: Animated musical

In the faraway Kingdom of Arendelle, little Princess Elsa has the power to control and create ice and snow. She uses it to play with her younger sister Anna. One night, after Elsa accidentally hits Anna on the head almost killing her, their parents take them to a colony of trolls to heal Anna and make her forget her sister’s ability. When they return to the castle, Elsa stays in her room scared of hurting Anna with her increasing power, causing a rift between the sisters.

In a storm

When the girls are teenagers, their parents are lost at sea during a storm. Years later, following Elsa’s 21st birthday and upcoming coronation as queen, the castle gates are opened to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years, much to the dismay of Elsa who fears people finding out about her abilities.

Anna meets Prince Hans, and falls in love and decides to marry him. But Elsa doesn’t approve.

What will she do? Is Elsa safe? Will Arendelle return to its former glory?

Ice cold facts:

When the gates open during “For The First Time in Forever,” there is a cameo of Rapunzel and Eugene (Flynn) from Tangled.

The characters of Hans, Kristoff, Anna and Sven are a reference to Hans Christian Andersen, the author of The Snow Queen, which is the inspiration for Frozen. Say the names quickly in sequence to hear the similarity.

402,2020/03/28,"In virus-hit Spain, former LaLiga winger Toni Dovale dons the white coat","Dovale trades his football boots to serve his country

Journeyman footballer Toni Dovale put his football boots to one side and slipped into a pharmacist’s white coat in the front line struggle against coronavirus in Spain.

The 29-year-old pharmacy graduate and former top-level sportsman had been playing football for a Thai club, but was visiting his family in Spain when the COVID-19 pandemic took hold.

So he decided to pitch in using the studies which he had yet to put into practice due to his passion for football. “I really was packing my bags to go back when things got complicated,” Dovale said.

Travel restrictions

Travel restrictions trapped Dovale in his native La Coruna in the Atlantic coast region of Galicia, where he started his football career with nearby Celta Vigo.

Although Dovale also completed his university studies in pharmacy four years ago, he had never actually worked in the field.

Now with the world of sport in limbo the footballer realised the time was ripe to use his studies to help his homeland.

“I was playing in Asia then; pharmacy is different there and I was never in Spain long enough to work,” he said. “With football stopped and travel banned I said to myself 'get some practical experience and do your bit'.”

'Fear'

The coronavirus is ravaging Spain with a death toll of over 4,800 and some 64,000 registered cases of infection. There is hope of course with around 10,000 people already cured of the virus in Spains for multimedia clients

“We're in a really frightening situation. Those of us working with the public are afraid, and the people who come to us for advice are afraid too,” says Dovale, who is working in a pharmacy run by his family.

He has gloves but no mask, and does not appear ready to lose his smile any time soon.

“We all know we are exposed, that this is a pandemic and a complicated situation,” he says. “But we all know too that our behaviour in complicated situations defines who we are, and for me I need to put fears for my own safety to one side and help in any way that I can.""

“There are shortages of many things and we are struggling to get enough of the simple things like thermometers, paracetamol, gloves and hand gels,” says Dovale.

Dovale has played football for Spanish top flight clubs Leganes and Rayo Vallecano, Sporting Kansas City in the United States and also Bengaluru in the Indian Super League before moving to Thailand.

“Right now I'm the same as everyone else in that I train at home jumping over the furniture,” he jokes. “I start at 7 a.m. and I use whatever I can including bottles of water and stuff like that. Then I go downstairs to the pharmacy.""

“I hope this is over as soon as possible and that I can go back to playing football again. Right now though everything is up in the air and I have no idea when sports will get going again over there (in Asia) or when we Europeans will be allowed to even travel again,"" he says, adding ""I have no idea how this is going to pan out. Let's just hope it's all over soon and I can get back to my normal life playing football.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/w8tldk/article31194821.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/aTH29TONY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/former-laliga-winger-dons-the-white-coat/article31194822.ece
403,2020/03/28,Farmers will not face problems in bringing vegetables to Vizag: Minister,"‘RTC is running special buses for them’

No implementation of social distancing at a few rythu bazaars, problems faced by farmers during transportation of essential goods, issues of migrant labourers during lockdown and a few other issues were discussed during the review meet organised by the Tourism Minister M. Srinivasa Rao along with District Collector V Vinay Chand, officials from the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) and others concerned, here on Saturday.

Speaking during the review meet, Mr. Srinivasa Rao reiterated that there would not be any problem for farmers during the transport of vegetables to the city. He said that he had already discussed the issue with the police, for which RTC is running special buses. He also said that to keep a watch over the implementation of lockdown and also to ensure provision of essential commodities in the rural areas, they have appointed a committee which include a police official, Tahsildar and MPDO.

During the meet, a few political representatives brought to the notice of the Minister that GVMC do not have adequate quantity of bleaching powder due to which the spraying operations are not being properly done. Responding to it, GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana said that they have received bleaching powder stock on March 27.

Over the arrangements at ration depots, the Minister said that one volunteer would be present at the ration depot to help public. The volunteer will ensure social distancing is followed, he said.

Paderu MLA K. Bhagya Lakshmi complained that several migrant labourers were entering the district from East Godavari border and asked for strengthening of surveillance there.

411,2020/03/28,Who’s afraid of a virus wolf?,"The human tryst with epidemics is as old as the hills; writers over centuries have repeatedly explored it in prose and verse, underlining not just its terrifying power but also the resilience of the human mind in confronting it

After the hailstorm of graves/ the column was thrust up high/ and four old poets/ leaned back on it / to write on the books pages/ their bestsellers.

— Jaroslav Seifert in ‘The Plague Column’ (Translated by Ewald Osers from Czech)

In his poem, ‘The Abandoned Cemetery at Balasore, India’ Jayanta Mahapatra conjures up an atmosphere of “timeless ennui” that foreshadows an epidemic looming over human kind. For the poet, the cholera epidemic embodies “a quiet power” as it “moves easily, swiftly” through “past and present” into “the growing young, into the final bone”, threatening to wear down “all truth with ruin”. The poem underlines the insignificance of human life against a contagious malady’s potent power.

As we struggle with the outbreak of Covid 19, we must remember that the human tryst with epidemics is as old as the hills. From the Antonine Plague (165-180AD), the Plague of Justinian (541-543 AD), and the Great Bubonic Plague in Europe (1346-1353) to the Spanish Flu (1918-20) HIV (1981-) and the Asian Flu (1957-58). It was Homer who first used the term epidemios for the returning natives in Odyssey. The word was first advocated as a medical term in a treatise by Hippocrates to mean “that which circulates or propagates in a country.” Writers over centuries have explored the impact of epidemics in prose and verse.

Living with death

“The plague was posting sentries at the gates and turning away ships bound for Oran,’’ wrote Albert Camus. For contemporary readers, the fictional examination of a pandemic is almost synonymous with Camus’ The Plague. The seminal allegorical work is a critique of “repugnant materialism” as well as a graphic account of human confrontation and co-habitation with death.

How true these words ring today: “Many continued hoping that the epidemic would soon die out and they and their families be spared. Thus they felt under no obligation to make any change in their habits, as yet. Plague was an unwelcome visitant, bound to take its leave one day as unexpectedly as it had come.”

As research, Camus meticulously studied earlier histories and literature, going back to Thucydides’ account of the typhus plague that ravaged Athens. Later writers explored and expanded the plague metaphor further. Notable among these is José Saramago’s Ensaio sobre a Cegueira (Blindness) and Mario Bellatin’s Salon de Belleza (Beauty Salon).

Laws dissolved

Perhaps the most virulent pandemic in human history is the Black Death of the 14th century that lasted till as late as the early 18th century, recurring at sporadic intervals. Then too, the initial outbreak devastated Italy, inflicting heavy casualties on Florence; and later in Marseilles, France.Giovanni Boccaccio’s The Decameron, composed in the 14th century, which inspired Geoffrey Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales, provides an authentic description of the pestilence in Florence. In his introduction, Boccaccio chronicles the devastation he witnessed: “In this sore affliction and misery of our city, the reverend authority of the laws, both human and divine, was all in a manner dissolved and fallen into decay, for (lack of) the ministers and executors thereof, who, like other men, were all either dead or sick or else left so destitute of followers that they were unable to exercise any office, wherefore everyone had license to do whatever pleased him.” Chaucer’s portrayal of plague in ‘The Pardoner’s Tale’was in all probability inspired by Boccaccio, although England had been repeatedly ravaged by plague between 1348 and 1376.

Ravings and ragings

Daniel Defoe gives a firsthand account in A Journal of the Plague Year Written by a Citizen who Continued all the While in London (1722): “And here I must observe also that the plague, as I suppose all distempers do, operated in a different manner on differing constitutions; some were immediately overwhelmed with it, and it came to violent fevers, vomitings, insufferable headaches, pains in the back, and so up to ravings and ragings with those pains; others with swellings and tumors in the neck or groin, or armpits, which till they could be broke put them into insufferable agonies and torment; while others, as I have observed, were silently infected, the fever preying upon their spirits insensibly, and they seeing little of it till they fell into swooning, and faintings, and death without pain.” More than two centuries later, Thom Gunn would describe the AIDs epidemic in his poem ‘In Time of Plague’:

My thoughts are crowded with death

and it draws so oddly on the sexual

that I am confused

confused to be attracted

by, in effect, my own annihilation.

Comic proportions

Epidemics and human responses to it occasionally gained a lighter dimension. In Due Preparations for the Plague as well for Soul as Body, Defoe narrates the extraordinary precautionary measures taken by the head of a family during a self-imposed quarantine that lasted an amazing five and a half months in 1665. Besides gathering provisions for the family (husband, wife, three sons, two daughters, two maids and an apprentice), elaborate measures, often of comic proportions, were undertaken to prevent infection. Even letters delivered by the postman were purified: “...he caused the porter to smoke them with brimstone and with gunpowder, then open them, and to sprinkle them with vinegar; then he had them drawn up by the pulley, then smoked again with strong perfumes, and, taking them with a pair of hair gloves, the hair outermost, he read them with a large reading-glass which read at a great distance, and, as soon as they were read, burned them in the fire; and at last, the distemper raging more and more, he forbad his friends writing to him at all.”

It wasn’t just the plague; with colonial ambitions came the ‘White Man’s Burden’, a self-inflicted responsibility assumed by the British that came with its unique share of cholera, small pox, flu, dysentery, tuberculosis and a host of other epidemics. Corresponding with his aunt Edith Macdonald in 1884, young Rudyard Kipling articulated his fears, emblematic of those that plagued the average European in India: “As you are seven thousand miles away, I don’t mind telling you that there has been a case of sporadic cholera already and, as this is the third year since we had the last epidemic, we are anticipating a festive season later on.” The outbreak of epidemics in the colonised space was often interpreted as a ‘problematic reversal’ of the aggressive act of subjugation by the colonisers.

Wrath of deities

However, beyond the Euro-centric portrayal of epidemics, there were also indigenous accounts. Celebrated Hindi poet Suryakant Tripathi’s memoir, A Life Misspent, provides a heart-rending account of the influenza epidemic that ravaged India during the early years of the 20th century: “I travelled to the riverbank in Dalmau and waited… The Ganga was swollen with dead bodies. At my in-laws’ house, I learned that my wife had passed away.”

In Bengali writer Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay’s works, malaria is an inevitable part of rural life. His central protagonists, Ramesh in Pallisamaj, Brindaban in Panditmasay, orSrikanta in Srikanta, are frequently portrayed as altruists, eager to take on the arduous task of rescuing pandemic-afflicted villagers, oblivious to the danger of contagion. Interestingly, the villagers held the wrath of deities responsible for diseases like plague, cholera and small pox, and made offerings to goddesses like Olabibi, Sitala, Manasa, Bonobibi, Olaichandiand others.

Epidemics feature in Tagore’s novels too. In Chaturanga (1916), when Calcutta is scourged by plague, Saachish’s compassionate uncle converts his home into an infirmary for the poor, but while nursing the patients, succumbs to the disease.

Literature, in responding to epidemics, celebrates the enduring range of human responses, the gamut of feelings that rage against the onslaught of disease and death. We will no doubt see poets and writers chronicle the current difficult times too.

412,2020/03/28,"Freedom, we choose","The Hindu Prize 2019 for Fiction and Non-Fiction reinstates the newspaper’s commitment and support to new and powerful creative voices in the country

When he won The Hindu Prize 2012 for his novel Em and the Big Hoom, Jerry Pinto said, “Most precious of all is the freedom to think. We must band together to protect everyone’s right to think the way they want to. It is us — all of us — who must protect freedom of speech and expression.” And this freedom has remained the cornerstone of The Hindu Prize over the 10 years of its existence. In 2018, a Non Fiction category was introduced to demonstrate the paper’s commitment and support to new and powerful creative voices in the country.

Compelling books

This year, The Hindu Prize 2019 has been awarded to Santanu Das’s India, Empire, and First World War Culture (Non-Fiction) and Mirza Waheed’s Tell Her Everything (Fiction).

In the citation for India, Empire, and First World War Culture, the jury says, “The sweep of its historical imagination, its

compelling prose style and its ethical seriousness make this work a tour de force. Its depth of research and its engagement with a rich variety of archival sources — textual, visual and auditory — are truly remarkable. Letters, diaries, songs, sound recordings of prisoners-of-war, photographs, drawings and paintings, in addition to a spectrum of official archives, from Punjab to Bengal and beyond, help to recreate the varied facets of the war experience in India, Britain and Mesopotamia. Longing, homesickness, fear, pride, loyalty, loss and, above all, the tensions and intimacies of inter-racial relationships resonate powerfully in Das’s narrative” and that the book “will endure not only for its outstanding scholarship but as an exemplar of an alternative mode of writing that reveals the multisensory dimensions and the human costs of the First World War.”

Speaking of his win, Santanu Das said he was “thrilled — and deeply honoured. My first thoughts go to the over one million sepoys and non-combatants who have for so long wandered in the no man’s land between Eurocentric memories of World War I and nationalist histories of South Asia. The Hindu Prize means a lot; for my training is in English literature and I took a gamble. I wanted to go beyond a conventional grand narrative sealed up in medals, memorials and events, and instead open up from below the historical past — intimate, palpable and incorrigibly plural — by looking at objects, images, rumour, letters, diaries and sound-recordings from around the world as well as literary and political writings. This involved a redefinition of the ‘archive’ as well as how to evoke the messy underworld of feelings and experiences through the act of research and writing.”

Heartbreakingly resonant

Further, he was “struck by how heartbreakingly resonant the material was for our times, whether it was Tagore on the dangers of nationalism, or this letter written on July 17, 1916 by a sepoy: ‘We wandered about Paris for eight hours. On that day, we all ate at the same table. Our company was composed of five sepoys, of whom three were Sikhs and two Muslims, two sweepers and three cooks; but we all ate together at the same table. Moreover, we have often eaten food and drunk tea prepared by Muslims.’”

Describing Tell Her Everything as “a compelling novel” and “extraordinary work of fiction,” the jury describes it as evolving “from a sentimental drama to a gripping account of the darkness within the soul. The writing is delicately nuanced to capture the subtlest fears and the most concealed denials of its first-person narrator. Waheed conveys his protagonist’s suppressed guilt, his longing to be understood, his urge to justify what he has done, a terrible deed in a terrible time...’

‘In laying bare the soul’s compromise with evil, Mirza Waheed forces us to confront not only individual human frailty but also the decadence of our times.” Speaking of being “honoured”at having won the prize, Waheed said, “Being on the shortlist alongside such illustrious writers was wonderful enough; this is simply delightful. I’m grateful to the judges for such a generous reading of Tell Her Everything.”

413,2020/03/28,Valley of sighs: Review of Nitasha Kaul’s ‘Future Tense,"Kaul’s depiction of contemporary Kashmir and its troubles is affecting and detached by turns

Nitasha Kaul’s second novel, set in contemporary times, follows young Kashmiris as their lives intertwine only to be thrown apart. It follows them as they deal with love and identity weighed down by the burden of their inheritance.

Kaul’s Kashmir is a haunting spectre, desolate in its beauty, where the past is always present, unshakeable. A Kashmir that won’t let two people be together simply because of its complex history.

Tangled web

Through the lives of Fayaz, Shireen and Imran, Kaul demonstrates that for Kashmiris time is not linear; the past, the present and the future exist simultaneously, constantly and inescapably. Fayaz deals with his disintegrating marriage and a disillusioned

career choice; his nephew, Imran, must choose his future from among limited, predetermined options; Shireen discovers there is nowhere to go unless she knows where she came from. In the evolution of their friendships, Kaul manages to unpack value systems: they must negotiate for personal freedom and space as they come of age, contending with their respective families and the traditions they hold on to.

Kaul makes a few splendid leaps from humour to pathos as she depicts the tangled web of morality that all Kashmiris must come to terms with. As when Bichor, Imran’s friend, realises that the money his friend, Rafiq, had given him for his parents is now worthless, thanks to demonetisation. The Indian Prime Minister is referred to as The Great Leader — a nice touch. Bichor and Rafiq scheme to take revenge against India for what happened to the Valley in the summer of 2016.

Family heirlooms

At the same time, certain events are just irredeemably dark, offering no hope. Ghulam the boatman drowns in sheer exhaustion when he is sent back to get the bags of the three passengers he had rescued after his shikara overturned. Rehan, Fayaz’s friend, reminisces about his childhood in the Valley in the 90s, recalling how children would gather dust in plastic bags and throw it at each other, pretending they are grenades. Such realities won’t be unfamiliar to Kashmiris — they suggest the seemingly innocuous process of radicalisation, the fruitless hope for change, the snobbery of the English-speaking liberals in posh cafés, the crisis of belonging.

In one of the early chapters Fayaz talks about his wife, Zeenat, and Srinagar as one; both harsh, unforgiving, resilient and indifferent to him.

Despite such intricate insights, what might end up irking the reader is Kaul’s prose. In places it is too formal — she assumes a clinical, academic detachedness while describing certain events and characters that gives the impression of an indifferent narrator speaking. The pace of the book is bogged down at times by ruminations and the overzealous use of metaphors and analogies that serve little function. The emotional content gets mired in its long, overdrawn articulation.

However, Kaul does paint a convincing portrait of contemporary Kashmir. The lucid depiction of the robustness of its natural beauty undercut by the emotional turmoil of its people is no small feat, considering that Kashmir is several kingdoms rolled into one. Where political ideology is a family heirloom passed down for generations and the attempt to escape the inheritance is taken as a form of betrayal.

The novel ends with Zeenat’s shikara ride with her adopted son, who looks into her eyes and smiles, which makes her feel alive for once, after all the turmoil of her marriage and the conflict in the Valley — a moment symbolic of the brokered peace, the fissure of calm that her characters manage to shelter themselves in. It’s a fitting end for these troubled times.

414,2020/03/28,‘It is important to embrace the messiness of the past’: Santanu Das,"For his book on the Indian sepoys of the Great War, Santanu Das recovered the histories of people who did not know how to read or write

Over a million Indian soldiers served in World War 1. But there was no Wilfred Owen among their ranks to record the horror and pity of war in heart-rending verse. This means that most of their stories were assumed to be lost to time till researchers started combing the archives. Santanu Das’s India, Empire, and First World War Culture collects “raw histories” — objects, images, rumours, pamphlets, letters, diaries, sound-recordings, folk songs, poetry, essays and fiction — all relating to the forgotten sepoys, to create a lifelike portrait of the WWI soldier in his time. It adds layers of perspective to existing narratives to show how the Great War affected the Indian soldier fighting a battle in which he had no personal stake. Excerpts from an email interview:

When and why did you become interested in the Indian soldiers of World War I?

While doing my first book, Touch and Intimacy in First World War Literature (2006), I was repeatedly struck by the complete erasure of the role of over one million Indian troops in standard (Western) books on World War I; neither was I taught about them at school in India. Something needed to be done. But what I sought to capture in my book was not just India’s war ‘contribution’ or how these men fought and fared but the teeming underworld of their feelings and experiences from below — in battlefields, hospitals and POW camps as they encountered new lands and people, lived and loved, or faced the horrors of trench combat. I wanted to recover the historical past not sealed up in medals and memorials but palpable, intimate and plural.

I also tried to locate the war in Indian socio-cultural history more broadly, from Gandhi’s recruitment speeches to photographs, testimonies and voice-recordings of the soldiers, from Punjabi women’s folk songs to the writings of Tagore, Iqbal, Gandhi and Sarojini Naidu to what the war meant for Indian nationalism.

How did you handle the research? What challenges did you face?

The book has taken me more than 10 years and around the world, from villages in Punjab to archives, battlefields and cemeteries across Europe and East Africa to museums in Australia and New Zealand. My primary challenge was how to recover the histories of people who did not know how to read or write, and this led me to go beyond conventional textual sources and re-conceptualise the ‘archive’: I looked at trench objects, photographs, paintings, letters, memoirs, posters, postcards, rumour, gossip, sound-recordings, songs, pamphlets, poetry, fiction. It is important to de-Europeanise our research methodology as well as our sources, think carefully what questions we should ask of the material and embrace the messiness and materiality of the past.

Is there any artefact you have uncovered that strikes you as being particularly telling or poignant?

I soon realised that the problem was not scarcity but an excess of quite remarkable material. Thus, in the Dupleix Museum in Chandernagore, I found the bloodstained glasses of ‘Jon Sen’ who, I later found, was the only non-white member of the Leeds Pals Battalion. He was killed on May 22-23, 1916. In the National Archives in Delhi, I came across the trench notebook of Mir Mast, an Afridi Pathan who had deserted to the German side and went on a jihadi mission to Istanbul and Kabul. In the Pitt Rivers Museum, I found a Naga ‘dance hat’, comprising a German helmet brought back from the Western Front and adorned with horns and hair. In Ypres, I visited the barn which was used as the casualty station for Indian troops.

But for me, the most haunting testimony was the tremulous voice of Jasbahadur Rai, a young Gurkha sepoy, recorded in the POW camp of Wunsdorf by his German captors on June 6, 1916 at 4 pm: “My body has become thin as a string, how much can I cry?” He died a few months later.

Do you think there should be a WWI museum in India? What should such a museum look like?

I understand that DAG and the ASI are already collaborating on such a museum.. It is essential that it be a war museum, not a military museum: war is far wider than combat; it’s about people, not just soldiers. It should reflect the army’s religious, ethnic and cultural diversity. It should be a space for commemoration and reflection rather than nationalist triumphalism. It is important not to lose sight of the horrors of war while recognising human courage and resilience.

415,2020/03/28,‘Bridgital Nation – Solving Technology’s People Problem’ review: Fantastic bond,"Two writers push for a virtual bridge to connect diverse India

Planners have long dreamt of building a bridge between education and work. The best that some of them could manage to create was a flyover — an approximate, long-range link between general skills that schools might teach and work opportunities in a flourishing economy.

To offer a bridge in the middle of an economic slowdown is bold indeed. N. Chandrasekaran and Roopa Purushothaman promise a multi-purpose bridge. Apart from schools and work, their bridge will help to link talent with opportunities, professionals with the masses, governments with the governed, and so on. The title reveals the versatile identity of the bridge _ it is digital.

This is not the first time we are being told about an all-purpose balm for all our miseries as a nation. Technology enthusiasts have been saying it all along, since the 1990s, to be precise, that old, time-consuming approaches can now be given a fair valedictory, simply because a brave, shining, corruption-free world is waiting to be inaugurated.

New words

The transition has now matured, having invented its own vocabulary. Words like change, problem and transition are out; they have been replaced, respectively, by transformation, challenge and disruption.

Although these verbal shifts have occurred globally, solution-advocacy is sharply national. That is why Chandrasekaran and Purushothaman call their book ‘bridgital nation’. They start and persist throughout the book that India can be treated as a unit, a cohesive entity, without conflicts or paradoxes, let alone contradictions. There is no room for acknowledging a political context either; everybody is presumed to be together in this search for solutions. The search is somewhat desperate, as it must be completed before our demographic dividend runs out.

Familiar though it sounds, the authors give it a distinct human, in fact, feminine character. Their style is that of purposive fiction, inhabited by characters chosen and carefully built to represent a problem, such as the socio-cultural constraints faced by women in the job market.

The plot or life-stories are well-crafted, to give a pan-India authenticity to the characters. All this imparts a seductive quality to the prose and a benign feel to its message.

The only irksome detail is the sub-title: ‘solving technology’s people problem’. It is all too transparent, suggesting that the technology is already there, leaping towards its next artificial intelligence. Its development is not going to wait for people or their governments to catch up. Hence, if people don’t benefit, it is their problem. Luckily, this unfortunate echo does not run through the book.

Two key areas

Education and health are the two key areas the authors hope will benefit most from the digital bridge they propose, in addition to agriculture, logistics, financial services and the judiciary.

Interestingly, they don’t seem to notice that in both education and healthcare, ‘bridgital’ solutions will deprive the main players, i.e. teachers and doctors, of the benefit that direct experience of diagnosis brings. If, for instance, a software can tell a teacher which specific activities will help different children, following their digitally evaluated performance in a test, why should the teacher worry about lack, or loss, of agency in a workplace jointly dominated by bureaucracy and corporations? In the fully bridgitalised world, professional agency and autonomy will be things of the past; a wealthy nation would regard them as memorabilia.

416,2020/03/28,‘V.P. Menon: The Unsung Architect of Modern India’ review: Adviser to the powerful,"A much needed biography of an outstanding bureaucrat in the run-up to Independence is marred by an overdependence on only one source, V.P. Menon’s papers

A biographer is inevitably dependent on papers left behind by her subject — diaries, correspondence, aide de memoire and so on. These are the principal sources based on which she reconstructs the life that she has chosen to portray. But these “private papers” as they are called in the historians’ trade need to be read with — and sometimes even against — other sources that are available for the period and for specific incidents.

It is the evaluation of various types of evidence that informs the craft of writing a biography and is also at the heart of history writing. The trap before the biographer is to take what her subject wrote at face value and as her only source. Such an approach often leads to a distorted perspective or an erroneous version of an event or incident. In spite of being a trained historian, Narayani Basu, occasionally falls headlong into this trap.

Root of a controversy

It is this propensity to depend on one kind of source — most often what V.P. Menon himself recorded or remembered — which is at the root of the controversy that is stalking this book and perhaps pushing up the sales figures. The latter will keep the publishers happy but Basu’s handling of the concerned incident does no good to her reputation as a historian. The incident is the formation of the first cabinet of independent India under Jawaharlal Nehru.

It is Basu’s claim that Nehru did not want Vallabhbhai Patel in that cabinet and that the latter was included only after V.P. Menon alerted Lord Mountbatten who spoke to Gandhi. According to Menon, as quoted by Basu, Patel’s name was included “as a sop”. All this is based on an interview Menon gave to H.V. Hodson and on Hodson’s recollections. Basu makes no effort to read this evidence — or check it against other available evidence.

Nehru and Patel

Evidence contrary to Menon’s claim and Hodson’s remembrance of that claim is easily accessible. Srinath Raghavan, one of the finest historians of modern India, presented this evidence in an article published immediately after the launch of this book. (‘Nehru never excluded Patel from the Cabinet List’, The Print, February 12, 2020) As Raghavan shows, Patel was directly involved in the formation of the first cabinet and that Mountbatten noted this in a report dated August 1.

As further evidence of Patel’s involvement on July 30, Raghavan cites Nehru’s letter to Patel in which he informed the latter that he had persuaded Ambedkar to join the cabinet as law minister. There is also a letter dated August 1, 1947 from Nehru to Patel in which he formally invited Patel to join the cabinet and described Patel as “the strongest pillar of the cabinet.” Patel replied: “Our attachment and affection for each other and our comradeship for an unbroken period of nearly 30 years admit of no formalities. My services will be at your disposal, I hope, for the rest of my life and you will have unquestioned loyalty and devotion from me in the cause for which no man in India has sacrificed as much as you have done. Our combination is unbreakable and therein lies our strength.” Patel’s name was on top of the list that Nehru sent to Mountbatten on August 4. Patel would also be the deputy prime minister.

Nothing of the above finds mention in Basu’s telling of the incident. She glibly accepts Menon’s version of things without checking it with the existing available evidence. This doesn’t speak highly of her as a historian. She wanted to create a sensation by making the utterly incorrect claim that Nehru wanted to exclude Patel, and included him only under pressure for which her subject – V.P. Menon -- was responsible.

Apart from the sensationalism, there is also Basu’s prejudice against Nehru which is evident throughout the book. It is a prejudice that she inherits from V.P. Menon on whose papers she is so completely dependent. To give one example: On p.413, Basu writes, “In the weeks following Gandhi’s assassination, there were calls for Patel to resign, and Nehru wearily told Krishna Menon that it was perhaps for the best if Patel stepped down.” She proceeds to support her statement by quoting what Nehru wrote to Krishna Mennon, “He [Patel] has rather changed in the past few months. He has been the target of many attacks, more especially in regard to the assassination of Gandhiji and he has become rather nervous on certain subjects. Any express or implied criticism in this context upsets him.” Where in these lines penned by Nehru is there even the suggestion that he would prefer Patel to step down? This is an example of a very tendentious reading of a letter.

Painstaking research

These examples are unfortunate because this book is the product of very painstaking research into a treasure trove — the papers of Menon. The over dependence on these papers makes for a flawed biography and on occasion very poor history. This is a biography that needed to be written and Basu must be complimented for having taken on this project. Menon rose from humble beginnings to be an outstanding bureaucrat and the confidante of some of the great and the mighty. He remained true to his ideological convictions and spent the twilight years of his life with the Swatantra Party and the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. He played a sterling role in the integration of the princely states into the Indian republic. Without his work with Patel, the Indian republic would not have acquired the shape that it did. It is also true that Menon’s work has not always been recognised. Thus the word ‘unsung’ in the subtitle is justified. But ‘architect of modern India’? Does modern India consist of only the integration of the princely states? Biographers should be careful about what claims they make for their subject.

Basu is also badly served by her publishers because the book has no index. This is an appalling omission in a book of this kind.

417,2020/03/28,‘The Social Question in the Twenty-First Century – A Global View’ review: For a coalition of the excluded,"Will the undocumented migrant, the indebted farmer, the brutalised student, and the demonised minority forge an alliance in a quest for social justice?

It took a Thomas Piketty to settle the question for all those allergic to Karl Marx: does capitalism promote inequality? Yes. Piketty proved with empirical data what Marx had proved using dialectics — that in a capitalist society, the wealthy earn from their assets, without having to work, much more than what the working classes earn from their wages and salaries. The rich get richer, and the poor, poorer, unless the state intervened. It was only through tax-funded redistributive policies such as pension schemes and subsidised healthcare that capitalist societies achieve a measure of stability.

But in recent times, following the global rise of neo-liberalism, governments around the world have started retreating from their social responsibility, preferring to put their faith in ‘market solutions’. It is against this backdrop of neo-liberal orthodoxy taking root in policy circles that this anthology of scholarly essays brings the focus back on an old question that has receded from public memory: the social question.

Search for dignity

What exactly is the ‘social question’? Simply put, it is the age-old, human quest for social justice and dignity. It has found expression in different ways throughout history — in wars, mass migrations, the founding of new religions, cults and kingdoms. However, this ancient quest crystallised into the ‘social question’ quite late in human history. As sociologist Goran Therborn, one of the contributors to this volume, which is an open access publication and available free online, observes, it was only “in a context of Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution — the former by putting inequality before the law, and the latter by producing poverty and misery by wage labour” that the social question emerged as a concept.

In other words, the social question is organically linked to the rise of wage labour.

Just as wage labour spread at different times to different parts of the world, answers to the social question have followed different trajectories. In the Global North, the social democratic welfare state became the norm. In the Global South, the State’s social protections remained weak and perpetually under pressure from mounting debt as the country tried to balance growth and redistribution.

Widening disparity

The third trajectory, followed by the erstwhile communist countries, saw the State taking complete ownership of both capital and labour.

But by the first decade of the 21st century, all the three responses to the social question (the social democracies of Western Europe, the redistributive states of the Global South, and the Communist bloc) had converged into one stream: the neo-liberal state that speaks not of social justice or equality, but ‘poverty eradication’.

Today it’s a truism that economies of the Global South, such as India, are striving to become like the developed West by growing faster and bringing economic prosperity to all its citizens. But anthology editors Dutch sociologist Jan Breman, social historian Marcel van der Linden, and U.S.-based sociologists Kevan Harris and Ching Kwan Lee, contend that what is actually happening is the opposite: with increasing informalisation and flexibilisation of the work force, and the rise of a ‘precariat’ following de-industrialisation, it is the informal economy, widening disparity, and growing pauperisation of the Global South that is spreading to the Global North.

“The social question of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was the workers question,” notes Therborn. But with workers marginalised, and lacking a political voice, who is left to articulate this question? At the moment, there appears to be no one. Perhaps there is potential for a coalition of the variously excluded. Can the undocumented migrant, the indebted farmer, the daily wager, the brutalised student, and the demonised minority forge an alliance rooted in a common quest for social justice?

Whether unlikely allies manage to bridge class and identity divides for a common political programme will determine if, and how, the social question is articulated in the 21st century.

418,2020/03/28,"COVID-19: How to keep your palms soft, after washing hands","With the incessant — but necessary — washing and sanitising of our hands these couple of months, here’s how to make sure they don’t get too dry

Wash your hands. We can’t stress that enough in the light of COVID-19. Doctors have recommended that you wash for 20 seconds with soap and water or use sanitisers with 70% alcohol, which is a known drying agent. It’s not just a cosmetic feel-good factor. Trapping moisture in the skin is necessary to prevent cracks, which in turn can attract infection. Here’s how to lock the moisture in, right after you wash.

Basic hand care

Almond oil, olive oil, coconut oil all work, says Chennai-based dermatologist Dr Deepika Lunawat. However, sesame seed oil is not suitable for sensitive skin, says Dr Jaishree Sharad, founder of Mumbai-based Skinfiniti.

She also suggests the use of aloe vera. “Pluck aloe vera leaves and extract the sap out of them to apply on your palms,” she says. This is also the time when we are cooking more than usual. “Before cooking, first apply a few drops of ghee on your palms to prevent damage from acidic vegetables that we cut, like onions, potatoes, and tomatoes,” she says.

In the absence of moisturisers, oiling your palms also works

Handy guide

Shahnaz Husain gives us recipes for soft hands

Daily: For very dry hands and nails, mix together one tablespoon almond oil, one tablespoon sesame seed oil, one teaspoon wheatgerm oil. Apply daily and massage it into the skin.

Daily in the evening: Add one teaspoon pure glycerine to 50 ml of rose water. Keep in an airtight bottle in the fridge. Apply on the hands and leave on for half an hour. Then, wash it off with plain water.

Thrice a week: Mix into a paste 2 tablespoons sunflower oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice and 3 tablespoons coarse sugar. Apply and rub into hands. Wash off after 15 minutes.

Don’t forget the back Shahnaz Husain reminds us that it is the back of the hands that is prone to early wrinkling, and shares her moisturising technique.

Apply the cream on the back of the hand. Work down each finger, starting from the tip. Use tiny circular movements on the joints of the fingers. Massage the back of the hand, using strokes moving from the fingers towards the wrist. Massage the cream on the nails and the skin around the nails too.

Palm care routines

Soak hands in water for 15 minutes, and then apply 2-3 drops of coconut, olive, or almond oil. Wrap hands in baking gloves for 15 minutes and wash off with plain water, suggests Chennai-based dermatologist Dr Renita Rajan.

For an overnight routine, she suggests applying a drop of your moisturiser, and wearing a pair of socks over your hands. If you can’t do it all night, try it for an hour. This will increase absorption. Avoid this if you have sweaty palms, as it will increase irritation.

While you are watching a movie, run malai (top of the milk cream) on your palms for 10 minutes, and rinse under water, says Dr Sharad. “Milk cream is a good hydrating agent and rebuilds lost skin cells.”

“If the skin on your palms is scaling due to excessive dryness, or has developed cuts, apply turmeric as it is an antiseptic, and clean it with coconut or almond oil instead of washing it,” she adds. Finally, keep yourself hydrated, Dr Lunawat reminds us.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/9mu23h/article31192850.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30mpanchor1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/covid-19-how-to-avoid-dry-skin-after-washing-hands/article31192853.ece
419,2020/03/28,The journey of standing still,"How staying at home, thanks to the coronavirus, made me rethink the way I travel

I had travelled incessantly for months, and all over the globe — from Tokyo to Seattle, from Oslo to Cairo. I gained points for frequent flying, but lost the discernment of a thoughtful traveller. In every new city, the hotel room appeared to be an exact copy of the one I had left behind.

Slowly, the boundaries between the places began to blur. One night, I tumbled out of bed with hunger pangs and began hunting for a sushi joint on the streets of Cairo. That’s when I knew I needed a break. No, not another trip out, but a trip back home.

Just as this thought of staying home began to solidify in my head, the coronavirus outbreak hit the news. Soon, the first cases appeared in Sweden, where I live. Being home for weeks was no longer an option, it was a necessity.

I decided to take a complete break, which meant I would not go to office, not attend any calls or meetings. In fact, why not combine that with a digital detox, I wondered. So, I packed my phone away, depositing it with a friend with instructions not to open the door if I came knocking a few hours later.

I felt an odd calmness. I heard birds chirping on the trees as I sat down with my coffee in the balcony. I sipped slowly, consciously. I had lived in this apartment for more than three years, but realised I was unfamiliar with some parts of it. Like the balcony, where the wood on the floor was chipping off. Maybe it could do with a small gurgling fountain in a corner.

Forgotten books

By late morning, the signs of boredom set in. I became restless; was I missing out on emails or messages? Given that there was no TV or Netflix any more, I had to find solace elsewhere. Books, those long-forgotten friends, came to my rescue. A large pile collected dust on my table — books that I had picked up at various airports but never got around to reading. I examined them: they ranged from business to science to personal development, with some fiction thrown in. I picked up Llosa’s The Time of The Hero, in preparation for his talk in Copenhagen later in the year. I picked Neil Gaiman’s American Gods as well, a book that I had heard many things about. I needed engaging non-fiction, so I added Cal Newport’s Deep Work and some Harvard Business Essentials to the lot.

Meditation too

The days became easier. I got into a rhythm, neatly compartmentalising my days: I read non-fiction in the mornings and afternoons, and saved up fiction for the evenings. In between, when my eyes got tired, I meditated. In the evenings, after dinner, I went for a long walk away from crowded places.

There are several streams in Malmö, and I walked along a different one every day.

By the end of the week, I had read five books, more than I had read in the last six months. What stood out was Deep Work — about how we are increasingly distracted in this hyper-connected world, and our ability to do high-focused work is diminishing. Though I craved for my smartphone, the urge lessened in the course of the week. I felt more in control. I also noticed that I had slept better throughout the week, thanks to regular meditation, zero screen-time, and an unplanned, loose schedule peppered with good literature. When I first seriously started travelling in my early 20s, I wanted to drown myself in different cultures, understand the subtle differences that exist between cultures and appreciate them. Even with little money in my pocket, I had made journeys that taught me life lessons and established friendships that survive to this day.

Over time though, with more money to spare, I could fly to remote parts of the world; I had become a tourist. I realised I was now browsing through the places that I visited, rarely taking the time to dig deep, or establish any connection to the place or its people. The more I travelled, the more I sought familiarity. My travels had turned from collecting experiences to ticking boxes.

They say recognition is the first step to change. This travel curfew, imposed on me by the pandemic, got me thinking about rationing my travel, sprinkling it over the year; and when I do travel, I decided I would let myself be educated by the unfamiliar and the unknown.

Sometimes, standing still is the best journey of all.

420,2020/03/28,‘Easy to blame China; but India’s wildlife trade is thriving too’,"India just doesn’t have enforcement even though it has some of the strongest laws, says forensic scientist Samyukta Chemudupati

Samyukta Chemudupati began her career as a forensic science teacher and now trains frontline forest department personnel to use forensics in wildlife crime investigation — to link the crime scene to the criminal — whether it is through profiling human DNA, analysing gunshot residues on animals, or tracking black money trails.

Head of forensics at Wildlife Conservation Trust, Mumbai, Chemudupati talks about the link between wildlife trade and zoonotic disease, and the fall guys and kingpins of this activity — the fourth largest illegal trade worldwide.

Could the growing discourse on zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19 bring about a more concerted effort globally to crack down on illegal wildlife trade, one of the many speculated sources of the pandemic?

Well, that’s an interesting point because organisations across the world have actually looked at the spread of coronavirus, and have now called upon leading nations to use this information to understand how illegal wildlife trade not only decimates wildlife, but also transmits diseases from wild animals. I don’t think there is enough information to substantiate a clear relationship between illegal wildlife trade and coronavirus yet; but the important thing to consider is that when you’re removing a wild animal from a space where it serves a critical function, you’re also moving whatever it has inside of it — you are moving any diseases they may carry to a new area, while also removing the functionality that the animal serves within that ecosystem.

You have said that while we point fingers at traditional Chinese medicine, we must introspect on wildlife trade in our own country.

Yes, wildlife is consumed in a huge variety of ways in India. It could be something as simple as a baba who sits in a city peddling some kind of component of, say, a spiny-tailed lizard, as a supposed cure for arthritis. It could be the use of peacock feathers in temples or in our homes as decorative items. It could be coral in our jewellery. It could be meat from wild boar or deer. It could even be something as obscure as black magic practices — for example, owls are in extremely high demand around Diwali, because people believe this is when you should be culling them to appease the gods.

The wildlife pet trade is very big too, but the market hasn’t been surveyed in detail, so we don’t know the precise extent of wild animals in captivity. But it is safe to say that everybody knows somebody in their immediate social or family circle who has a wild animal as pet. It could be something as innocuous as a parakeet, which is protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, or a star tortoise, which is also a scheduled species under the Act. So, while it is easy to blame traditional Chinese medicine, in our own country there continues to be a huge demand for wildlife, and the illegal wildlife trade is thriving.

The ‘bad guys’ of wildlife crime in popular imagination are always the poachers — often the poorest people feeding the huge demand from cartels and consumers. Why do we hear so little about the real drivers of wildlife trade — the fourth biggest transnational crime in the world?

I think the simplest answer is that enforcement agencies themselves don’t know the real people behind these crimes. The guy who’s on the ground, actually doing these activities, is obviously the lowest hanging fruit. You can find him, he is easy to apprehend, he’s easy to photograph. Whatever it is that is driving him to do this activity — whether it is extra income to feed himself or his family — the fact is that somebody is exploiting his traditional skill; tribal hunters, for instance, are well-skilled at navigating the forest, at identifying animal tracks, locating them in places that most other people would probably die in. What is being lost in this entire narrative is that it’s not just these guys. There are also people within cities, middlemen, people who are working at international levels, kingpins of wildlife trade, who are using these people to line their pockets. But the fact remains that because they’re so well connected, you often don’t even know they are involved in a crime like this.

Even though we have tough laws in the form of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and we have a Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), you have said that India’s enforcement success is nowhere near satisfactory. Is wildlife crime not a priority?

It is only in the past decade or so that people have started to pay heed to wildlife crime. Not only is there apathy, the key agencies involved don’t talk to each other. So, for example, the WCCB may not talk to an agent who’s sitting at the border, or the border agent will not talk to the nearest forest department officer to say, ‘Oh, we spotted something’. Very often, coordination between States is lacking, so contraband could be moving between States and go completely undetected. There’s a huge systemic issue, as a result of which we don’t have the kind of enforcement we should have, despite having some of the strongest laws.

Does India need greater investment in wildlife forensic science as a discipline to deal with the enormity of the crime?

Absolutely. I think what we really need is an army — and not just of forensic scientists, who can evaluate evidence quickly, accurately scientifically, strongly — to be able to push the science to new borders. If you look at wildlife forensic scientists in the U.K., for instance, they are doing some fantastic groundbreaking research — they’ve developed techniques that can lift fingerprints off feathers and eggshells.

We need forensic scientists in India not just to aid enforcement agencies, but also to start pushing the envelope. The need for this was yesterday.

So, we definitely need more scientists to join the bandwagon, catch up, or push the science and do some fantastic science so we can really have strong evidence that will go to a courtroom where the judge will not be able to say that this case cannot be true; or we will not have a defence lawyer who will tear up a case to bits because the evidence is not packaged correctly or analysed correctly or the analytical techniques used can be put in doubt.

As the debate rages about the viability of convalescent plasma (plasma extracted from those who are recovering from coronavirus (COVID-19), a paper published in the Journal of American Medical Association has hit a home run for a possible treatment methodology. At a time when the world is grasping at straws for treatment methods, every positive outcome raises hope.

Though the study has a very small cohort, five patients, critically ill with COVID-19, the preliminary results are said to be promising, by experts across the world. In a paper authored by Chinese scientists Chenguang Shen, Zhaoqin Wang, Fang Zhao, et al, it has been argued that the ‘preliminary findings raise the possibility that convalescent plasma transfusion may be helpful in the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, but this approach requires evaluation in randomised clinical trials.’ While the cohort is small, there is less scepticism about the study results, experts argue, because the method (convalescent plasma) has worked well for other conditions.

118 labs ready to test for COVID-19, says ICMR

Five critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 and with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), who also had the following — severe pneumonia with rapid progression and continuously high viral load despite antiviral treatment; and mechanical ventilation — were chosen for treatment with convalescent plasma transfusion. The plasma was drawn from five patients, who had recovered from COVID-19. The study was conducted at the infectious disease department, Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital in Shenzhen, China, from January 20, 2020, to March 25, 2020. Clinical outcomes improved dramatically post the intervention, the authors record.

They added: “Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalised within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score decreased, and the ratio that determines severity of ARDS increased within 12 days (172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion.

Isolation is India’s best weapon: ICMR

ARDS resolved in four patients 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from the ventilator within two weeks. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital and 2 are in a stable condition 37 days after transfusion, the paper recorded.

‘Encouraging data’

Vincent Rajkumar, haematologist and oncologist at Mayo Clinic, in Minnesota, says: “This study provides encouraging data that treatment with plasma collected from patients who have recovered from COVID 19 treatment can work. Since collecting, storing, and giving plasma is routine process for blood banks, it’s something that is easy to do. It will also get increasingly easier as there are more and more people who recover from COVID-19.”

Meanwhile, the British Medical Journal has reported that the U.S. FDA has approved the use of plasma from recovered patients to treat people who are critically ill with COVID-19, ‘provided that doctors get approval over the telephone.’ The article added: The method has been used in the past to treat diseases such as polio, measles, and mumps, in the 1918 flu epidemic.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/7apoxy/article31194436.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-plasma,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/study-shows-good-results-with-plasma-treatment-for-covid-19/article31194437.ece
422,2020/03/28,"What is the difference between cleaning, disinfecting and sterilising?","Personal hygiene is very important during the time of Corona Pandemic. Though the words cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilising are used interchangeably, they are not the same.

During the corona pandemic, much has been spoken about personal hygiene, with the words cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilising used interchangeably.

First, cleaning. Cleaning is the removal of any visible particle, ranging from dust to fallen food. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes it as, “The removal of foreign materials (soil and organic material) from objects and is normally accomplished using water with detergents or enzymatic products.” This is also the first step to disinfection and sterilisation.

“It is enough to clean our houses as we always did, if there are no family members who are infected. But this process does not kill the bacteria or virus; it instead reduces its percentage on the surface,” says Dr. Vinay D., Consultant and Head, Department of Infectious Diseases, Apollo Hospital, Bengaluru. “If there are any people who are infected with the coronavirus, we should disinfect the common areas and the surfaces touched by the person, to avoid its spread.”

Disinfection helps us kill germs with the use of chemicals. “This can be done with bleach, chlorine or any alcohol-based product available in the market. But this process can still leave still behind vegetative spores on the surface.”

Some common areas that have to be disinfected are doorknobs, light switches, counter tops, tables, handles, taps, toilets, and electronic devices. “Check if the product says disinfectant in its label and make sure it has not passed its expiry date. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for its application. It is best to wear gloves when you are handling disinfectants to prevent irritation on the skin,” Dr. Vinay warns.

You can make a household bleach solution by mixing four teaspoons of bleach with a litre of water. In the kitchen, he suggests soaking utensils in warm soapy water for a few hours before washing them. “If you go out, soak your clothes in an antiseptic solution for 30 minutes. Wash these and dry them under the sun before you wear them again,” he says.

The next level is sterilising. According to the CDC, this process destroys all the microorganisms on the surface or in a fluid to prevent disease transmission associated with the use of that item. “It kills everything including the spores.” This is especially important for hospitals, where surgeries take place. “This is to make sure that the germs do not get transmitted from one patient to another. It can be done using heat, autoclave (steam under pressure) or radiation. But sterilisation is not essential to be done for the amount of germs that can be found at homes,” says Dr. Vinay.

423,2020/03/28,Possible transmission of novel coronavirus from mother to child,"Researchers found elevated levels of specific antibodies in a newborn

A possible case of transmission of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from the mother to the child has been reported on March 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The researchers from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and other hospitals found elevated levels of antibodies (IgM) against the coronavirus in a newborn.

The mother was laboratory confirmed to be positive for coroanvirus on January 31. A chest CT showed typical signs of infection in both lungs. On February 2, the mother was admitted to the Renmin Hospital in Wuhan. Molecular tests carried out four times confirmed that she was positive for the virus.

Caesarean section

On February 22, the infant was delivered by caesarean in a negative-pressure isolation room. The mother wore a N95 mask to reduce the chances of transmitting the virus to the newborn. The mother did not come in physical contact with the newborn after delivery. The mother’s vaginal secretions were negative for the virus.

The newborn did not exhibit any symptoms of infection and molecular tests (RT-PCR) carried out five times — from two hours after birth to 16 days — were negative.

However, the newborn showed elevated levels of antibodies against novel coronavirus even at two hours after birth and remained elevated till March 7, when the mother and child were discharged. However, molecular tests of the amniotic fluid and placenta were not done.

The authors say that the antibodies (IgM) cannot be transferred to the foetus through the placenta. So in all possibility the foetus was exposed to the virus for at least 23 days from the day the mother was diagnosed positive for the virus.

Although the baby was delivered by caesarean, infection with the virus at the time of delivery cannot be completely ruled out, the authors say. But even if the baby was infected to the virus during the time of delivery, it takes three–seven days for antibodies to the virus to start appearing. However, in this case, antibodies were seen just two hours after delivery.

“The elevated IgM antibody level suggests that the neonate was infected in utero,” the authors write. “IgG antibodies can be transmitted to the foetus through the placenta and appear later than IgM. Therefore, the elevated IgG level may reflect maternal or infant infection.” However, only when molecular tests of the amniotic fluid and placenta (which were not done in this case) show positive can one be certain of vertical transmission.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/bjbqld/article31192761.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29TH-SCICORONA-2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/possible-transmission-of-novel-coronavirus-from-mother-to-child/article31192788.ece

As the world is grappling with thousands of deaths and lakhs of coronavirus-infected cases, there is some hope as the world’s top university Oxford has announced its vaccine is entering Phase 1 clinical trials in humans.

In a press release, University of Oxford stated that its researchers working in an unprecedented vaccine development effort to prevent COVID-19 have started screening healthy volunteers (aged 18-55) on Friday for their upcoming ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine trial in England’s Thames Valley. The vaccine based on an adenovirus vaccine vector and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is already in production but won’t be ready for some weeks still.

Although this is the second vaccine to enter Phase 1, Oxford’s ‘viral vectored’ technology is more established, compared to Moderna’s RNA vaccine, which was the first to enter Phase 1. No RNA vaccines are currently licensed for human use.

According to details published by the University, preclinical work on the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine is being conducted in collaboration with several partners including Rocky Mountain Laboratories (NIH/NIAID), and the ‘CSIROxbridge Consortium’ led by Indian origin Principal Investigator Professor S.S. Vasan of Australia’s science agency CSIRO.

“This is a significant development in humanity’s fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has already claimed more than 25000 lives across the world with over half a million confirmed cases”, Prof Vasan told The Hindu from Australia.

Moderna and Oxford are amongst eight candidates selected and funded by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the world body coordinating the efforts against Covid. The other six are CureVac, Inovio, Institut Pasteur, Novavax, and the universities of Hong Kong and Queensland.

In fact, other than the eight CEPI-funded vaccines, there are also 14 other institutions including two from India: Pune-based Serum Institute of India and Ahmedabad based Zydus Cadila, which are engaged in developing vaccine for this infectious disease, according to the latest issue of the Nature Biotechnology journal.

The team at Oxford will enrol healthy volunteers aged between 18–55 years, who, if they pass screening, will be the first humans to test the new vaccine, called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.

The trial will provide valuable information on the safety aspects of the vaccine, as well as its ability to generate an immune response against the virus.

The Oxford University through its press release has invited interested individuals to volunteer to participate on the COVID-19 vaccine and register on its website.

The trial, a collaboration between the University’s Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group clinical teams, will recruit up to 510 volunteers, who will receive either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or a control injection for comparison.

Whilst the team will start screening people now to see if they are eligible to take part in the study, participants will not receive the vaccine for some weeks, as per the media statement.

The trial has been approved by UK regulators and ethical reviewers. Researchers are working as quickly as possible to get the vaccine ready to be used in the trial, which includes further preclinical investigations and production of a larger number of doses of the vaccine.

Professor Adrian Hill, Director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, said, “The Oxford team had exceptional experience of a rapid vaccine response, such as to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014. This is an even greater challenge. Vaccines are being designed from scratch and progressed at an unprecedented rate. The upcoming trial will be critical for assessing the feasibility of vaccination against COVID-19 and could lead to early deployment.”

Professor Andrew Pollard, Chief Investigator on the study, said, “Starting the clinical trials is the first step in the efforts to find out whether the new vaccine being developed at Oxford University works and could safely play a central role in controlling the pandemic coronavirus that is sweeping the globe.”",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/1fapbd/article31189701.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/oxfordhealth,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/oxford-universitys-coronavirus-vaccine-opens-for-clinical-trial-on-humans/article31189704.ece

426,2020/03/28,How population size shapes evolution patterns in E. coli,"Large populations tend to evolve into exercising fitness trade-offs

Studying cultures of E. coli bacteria, a group of evolutionary biologists from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, has found that the population size determines the kind of fitness trade-offs the microbes adopt. Fitness trade-off may be understood in the following manner: Organisms do not have the capacity to maximise all their functions at the same time. Often when they enhance one function, another function suffers, or when they adapt to survive well in one environment, they cannot survive or reproduce well in another environments. This is called a fitness trade-off. This concept has been used by evolutionary biologists to explain why species prefer one environment to another.

Generalists, specialists

There are several ways in which the concept of fitness trade-off originates. Evolution causes some organisms to be generalists, by which it is meant that they can survive in different environments, and basically they will have an tolerable level of fitness in all environments. The other option is they evolve into specialists, where the organism will have a high degree of fitness in a particular environment while having low fitness in other environments. An example of this is in the context of antibiotic resistance – generalists tolerate a wide range of distinct antibiotics (for example, multidrug resistant bacteria). On the other hand, specialist bacteria have to show a fitness trade-off. They resist one antibiotic (for instance, rifampicin) but become susceptible to another (for instance, tetracycline). From the example itself, it is clear that understanding how evolution brings about difference between specialists and generalists, for instance, is very important.

The study shows that large populations tend to evolve into specialists, exercising fitness trade-offs, whereas small populations evolve into generalists.

Environmental changes

“Ours is the first study to demonstrate a relationship between population size and fitness trade-offs and the results are important in understanding the population genetics of ecological specialization and vulnerability to environmental changes,” says Sutirth Dey of IISER Pune’s Department of Biological Sciences and the corresponding author of the paper published in the journal Heredity.

The study experimentally affirms the link between population size and evolution of fitness trade-offs. Apart from this there are practical implications. An example is described by Prof. Dey: “Owing to their higher extent of specialisation, larger populations can become more vulnerable to sudden changes in the environment.”

If the environment abruptly shifts between two states that show fitness trade-offs with each other, then populations with a history of evolution at larger numbers would be at a greater disadvantage than historically smaller populations. “For example, costs of antimicrobial resistance are expected to check the spread of resistant microbes if antimicrobials are removed abruptly from the environments. Moreover, pathogens are also expected to experience fitness trade-offs when they migrate across different hosts,” explains Prof. Dey.

The group next plans to study the response in fluctuating environments. “We are now studying more complex links between population size and trade-offs, combining fitness data with population genomics, in both constant and fluctuating environments,” says Prof. Dey.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/4vj9cj/article31192823.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29TH-SCISUTIRTH-DEYjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-population-size-shapes-evolution-patterns-in-e-coli/article31192824.ece
427,2020/03/28,Silent spread of novel coronavirus in Italy went undetected for weeks,"By the time the first case was reported, the virus had already spread to most areas in southern Lombardy

Italy reported its first laboratory-confirmed case of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on February 20. But according to a study posted in a preprint repository arXiv, people appear to have been infected in early January and started showing symptoms by January 14. There apparently seems to have been a silent spread of the virus in the community for nearly 50 days.

By the time the first case was reported, the virus had already spread to most areas in southern Lombardy. Lombardy region, a district of 10 million, is the epicentre of the epidemic in Italy. So a day after the first case was reported, 28 more cases were confirmed, confirming the silent spread of the virus in the community.

Uncovering the trail

Contact tracing and testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic exposures to positive cases helped uncover the ongoing transmission prior to the laboratory confirmation of the first case.

The median age of people infected by the virus is 69 years and 47% of people who were infected required hospitalisation, of which 18% required intensive care. Each infected person spread it to 3.1 people, which started decreasing by end of the third week of February. The time between successive cases in the transmission chain, otherwise called as serial interval, was 6.6 days. “We did not observe significantly different viral loads in nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic,” the authors say in the preprint. Manuscripts posted on preprint servers are yet to be peer-reviewed.

“The transmission potential of COVID-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon,” the authors write. “Aggressive containment strategies are required to control COVID19 spread.”

Progression of disease

If there were just 530 cases on February 28, it increased to 5,830 by March 8. By early March, cases were reported from several areas in Lombardy region, a district of 10 million, which is the epicentre of the epidemic in Italy. As on March 26, there have been 74,386 cases, which is very close to China’s (81,782), and 7,503 deaths, which is the highest in the world.

The authors collected epidemiological data through standardised interviews of confirmed cases and their close contacts. The information gathered included dates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results, hospitalisation and contact tracing. The epidemiological analyses were carried out on 5,830 confirmed cases during the period January 14 and March 8.

Immediate response

Contrary to what one might imagine, there has been “almost immediate initial response” by the Regional Health System. The focus was to collect epidemiological data and perform model-based predictions, increase in testing and providing hospital assistance for affected subjects.

The authors say that efforts were taken to limit the spread through contact tracing and isolation. Despite these efforts taken quickly, the number of new cases kept rising steadily leading to “rapid saturation of the health emergency system with a progressive difficulty” in treating COVID-19 patients.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/o3lcmm/article31192773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29TH-SCIITALY1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/silent-spread-of-novel-coronavirus-in-italy-went-undetected-for-weeks/article31192774.ece
428,2020/03/28,Strike at the spike and win the war,"The spikes made of a glycoprotein are the business end of the virus

During the last six weeks, a series of research papers have appeared that offer medical solutions to defeat the life-threatening coronavirus infection - COVID 19. These are apart from the attempts to produce a protective vaccine against it.

The picture of how the novel coronavirus (scientists also call it SARS-CoV-2) looks is by now familiar to all of us (see the picture above). It is a roundish ball with spikes covering its entire body. These spikes, which are the business end of the virus, are made up of a glycoprotein, and the detailed structure of the spike protein and how it helps in entering the host (what an unwelcome name! but scientists are polite people) cell of the infected individual is seen by a Seattle-based group, using cryo-electron microscopy (https://doi.org/2020.02.19.956851,) and also in the journal Cell < cell.doi.10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058>. The spike protein recognises a specific enzyme called ACE2 on the cell surface, kills its activity and enters the host cell, and wreaks damage.

Learn from the past

Go back in literature, and one finds that this activity of the novel coronavirus is actually a historical one. People have studied the catastrophe caused in 1918 by the Spanish Flu pandemic, wherein millions died. The patients suffered severe lung damage, pneumonia, and acute respiratory syndrome, which has recently been seen again in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by the pathogen named SARS (called SARS-CoV coronary virus). Research here showed that the enzyme called Angiotensin Converting Enzyme or ACE2 fights against the viral attack and protects against damage (see; “good ACE, bad ACE do battle in lung injury, SARS” https://doi.org/10.1038/nm0805-821, and also that ACE2 is beneficial for hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (Tikellis C, Thomas MC. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) Is a Key Modulator of the Renin Angiotensin System in Health and Disease., International Journal of Peptide Research 2012, doi:10.1155/2012/256294).

Hence this repeated request by public health officials to senior citizens across the world, and to those with these problems to stay safe at home.

Molecular and genetic basis

Most recently, a very important paper appeared from the Wuhan-based CAS lab for special pathogens, which revealed the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus, its entry through deactivating ACE2 of the affected individual, plus another important point, namely, treatment of the affected by using the serum of a recently recovered patient. (This is important since it was shown as early as in 2006 by Liu and coworkers, < https://doi.org/10.1086/500469> when the SARS infected the world, treating the affected with the sera of recovered patients offered them the protective antibody IgG.). Hence the suggestion made across the world by some scientists that this can be followed in the present instance of COVID 19, too.

About the same time that this Wuhan work came about, comes another paper in the journal Cell from Leibniz, Germany (https://doi.org/10.1016.j.cel.2020.02.052), where the group confirmed that the novel coronavirus’ cell entry depends not only of ACE2 but another molecule (and enzyme) in the host cell, called TMPRSS2. They suggest further that the latter can be blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor! This is an important advance, since we may now look for such blocking molecules as drugs against the dreaded enemy the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2!

Take Home Lessons

We thus see four different ways of overcoming the enemy. The very first is what people must do (use protective devices and methods, do not allow community spread, stay home and safe); the second is to attempt to use the serum from recovered patients to boost the immunity of the afflicted; the third is to look for drugs to treat the affected and the fourth is to devise successful vaccines. These take time — but hopefully in months and not in years. Let us therefore attempt all of these methods.

A few words about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID 19. Two days ago, the newspaper The Guardian of U.K. points out that as many as 35 companies worldwide are racing towards such a vaccine, and at least 4 of them have tested their products on animals. Some have repurposed and modified their earlier vaccines against SARS and MERS to try on COVID 19. And two companies are building vaccines based on the messenger RNA that COVID19 has. But clinical trials on humans will take time to check on their efficacies and side effects, which may be as long as a year or more. Let us therefore attempt all of these methods.

We know by experience that where there is distress, there is hope; where there is hope, there are efforts; where there are efforts, there are solutions; and where there are solutions, there is success.

429,2020/03/28,How artificial intelligence can aid eye testing,"A tool to detect diabetic retinopathy has been developed by Google and an international team of researchers

From diagnostics to drug development, artificial intelligence (AI) today has become a valuable extension of the medical field. A new addition to its long list of uses is a hi-tech screening tool developed by Google and an international team of researchers for detecting diabetic retinopathy a diabetic complication in the eye.

A study conducted at two eye care centres in India — Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai and Sankara Nethralaya, Chennai — which screened over 3,000 patients with diabetes, has shown that the AI’s performance exceeded the conventionally used manual grading method used to identify diabetic retinopathy . The AI had a specificity and sensitivity of around 90%. The results were published in JAMA Ophthalmology.

A specialised retinal fundus camera was used to take photos of the eye. “Usually when we need to evaluate the retina, we dilate the pupil to allow more light to enter the eye and illuminate the back of the eye. But in this fundus photography it is not necessary as a coherent beam of light can enter the small gap (Pupil) and take an image in just two to three minutes,” explains Dr. Rajiv Raman from Sankara Nethralaya, Chennai and one of the authors of the paper.

He adds that it is very easy to operate and the cost of the camera has also significantly reduced in the recent past. Tamil Nadu and Kerala governments already have over 150 of these cameras currently in use.

Once the images are taken, it is fed into the computer and the AI tool screens it for diabetic retinopathy. A previous paper published by the team in 2016 in JAMA explains how the AI tool was shown over 120,000 images of the retina and taught to identify what each lesion meant. According to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy scale, the AI tool was taught to grade the severity (none, mild, moderate, severe or proliferative) and give an instant report along with the recommendations.

Early intervention

“Diabetic patients are normally asymptomatic when the eye is concerned until the late stages or advanced stage when treatment is difficult or not so effective. So it is important to find the patient at an early stage and help prevent loss of vision,” explains Dr. Kim Ramasamy from Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai.

“What we have deployed here is an opportunistic screening. We placed the camera at the diabetologist’s clinic and trained their technician to take a picture of the back of the eye (retina) and upload it to the AI tool. In about two minutes, the patient can get their eye test report along with the other regular diabetic test reports. Based on this report, the diabetologist can further refer the patient to an ophthalmologist if needed.” he adds.

Dr. Ramasamy explains how the team has been testing this AI at even small Health Centres in Tamil Nadu. “When about 100 patients are screened, about 20 will have any level of diabetic retinopathy and only four to five might need intervention. But to track down this small number we absolutely need to screen all the diabetics, and we currently don’t have the facilities now. It would be great if we can have these opportunistic screenings at offices, railway stations or other public places,” adds Dr. Ramasamy.

Detecting breast cancer

The corresponding author of the paper Lily Peng adds in an email to The Hindu: “Beyond diabetic retinopathy we are also working on a number of other research projects using AI to tackle healthcare problems. Earlier this year, we showed in a research paper that AI models can help detect breast cancer in mammography images more accurately than doctors. Our research is still in the early stages, but it shows that AI can be a path forward to improve screenings for breast cancer and boost the chances of survival.”

430,2020/03/28,Infecting healthy people with coronavirus can speed up vaccine trials,"Participants will be carefully followed to monitor how they respond

Even if everything goes to plan, it will take at least 12-18 months for a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine to be tested if conventional clinical trial procedures are adopted. Meanwhile, thousands are getting infected and hundreds are dying every few days. As a result, the healthcare system is getting stretched and strained, and doctors are forced to remove ventilators from older or sicker patients to make them available for younger people who have better chances of survival, as seen in Italy.

A preprint, which has not been peer-reviewed and published in a journal, posted in the Harvard University repository, has proposed an alternative approach to test the candidate vaccine and make it available earlier.

Is there a way to hasten the vaccine development process so that a vaccine becomes available earlier?

Yes, there is an option to accelerate the process and possibly make the vaccine rollout possible several months earlier. The process is called the “Controlled human infection model (CHIM) or simply human challenge studies. The human challenge study does not involve the conventional Phase-3 trial where thousands of healthy volunteers receive either a vaccine or a placebo and followed up for a long time to assess the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Instead, about a hundred healthy volunteers are first vaccinated and then intentionally exposed to the novel coronavirus to test the ability of the vaccine to protect the individuals from getting infected. This will sharply cut the time taken to complete the trial.

What is the basic difference between a Phase-3 trial and a CHIM study?

In the case of the conventional Phase-3 trial, vaccine safety and efficacy are tested on high-risk volunteers who would get naturally infected. In this, all volunteers are mandatorily advised to reduce the risk of getting infected by following risk-reduction measures such as hand hygiene. Recruiting thousands of volunteers and waiting for a sizeable number of them to get infected to study the efficacy of the vaccine is what takes a long time.

But in the case of the human challenge study, previously uninfected volunteers will be first vaccinated and then deliberately exposed to the virus in a controlled environment and monitored on a regular basis. This drastically cuts down the time to study the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.

Has the CHIM model been used earlier in vaccine trials?

According to 2016 World Health Organization regulatory guidelines, human challenge studies have been conducted over hundreds of years. The yellow fever experiments conducted in the early 1900s helped prove that mosquitoes transmit the virus causing yellow fever. The human challenge studies have generally been used for testing “less deadly diseases” such as influenza, dengue, typhoid, cholera and malaria.

At what stage will the human challenge study be undertaken?

According to the corresponding author Prof. Nir Eyal from the Center for Population-Level Bioethics and Department of Philosophy, Rutgers University, New Jersey, human challenge study will come into the picture only after initial safety, vaccine dosage, number of doses required and immune responses have been verified through conventional Phase-1 and Phase-2 human clinical trials.

Who will be the ideal individuals recruited for the CHIM study?

While the coronavirus has been found to infect all age groups — children to older people — young adults in the age group 20-45 generally do not exhibit severe symptoms requiring hospitalisation and ventilator support. According to the authors, young adults who do not have any chronic conditions and who have not been already infected with the novel coronavirus will be the ideal candidates. These people should be residing in areas with high transmission rate and hence are at substantial risk of getting naturally infected with the coronavirus.

How will the vaccine be tested on the volunteers?

The safety and immune responses are tested through the conventional Phase-1 and Phase-2 trials. As part of the human challenge trial, the volunteers would be first exposed to the virus to cause an infection. “This is done to know the dosage required to produce an infection in about two-thirds of the participants,” explains Prof. Gagandeep Kang, executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad. She is not an author of the preprint.

“The symptoms caused by the infection will be milder than what people would get if naturally infected. To ensure that the virus causes only mild symptoms, a particular strain has to be selected or the virus should be weakened,” Prof. Kang explains. In the case of dengue, the symptom caused is just a rash and viraemia (presence of virus in the blood) and no fever, she says.

According to her, unlike in the case of Zika, the novel coronavirus does not seem to persist for a long time, thus making it ethically easier to undertake a human challenge route to test a vaccine.

The final step will involve volunteers randomly chosen to receive either the vaccine or a placebo. After a predetermined time, during which the body develops immune response to the vaccine, the volunteers will challenged with the virus. According to the authors, the participants will be carefully followed to monitor how they respond to the viral challenge. The participants will remain isolated during the course of the study.

What will be the outcomes that will be monitored?

The authors say the primary endpoint of the trial will include measures of viral load, time taken for first symptoms to show up, and proportion of people who get infected despite being vaccinated. The immune responses in the vaccinated participants will be studied post viral challenge.

How soon will a vaccine be ready if human challenge model is adopted?

“We should have the vaccine by the end of the year if the human challenge model is adopted,” says Prof. Kang. “But licensing agencies will ask for efficacy studies to be carried out in large numbers of people post-licensing.”

However, the authors say they would conduct an expanded placebo-control study in the field on at least 3,000 people for evidence on immune responses and short-term adverse effects prior to applying for a licence.

Is carrying out a human challenge trial ethical?

“We let people, for example, volunteer to be emergency medical services during this period. That significantly elevates their risk of getting infected. But it’s also very important. In clinical trials in general, we don’t focus only on reducing risks to participants; we focus on achieving a reasonable balance between the added risks that they take and the importance for the community,” Prof. Eyal tells Nature.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article20668900.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th22-jacob-koshGIV2TFCUG3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/infecting-healthy-people-with-coronavirus-can-speed-up-vaccine-trials/article31190983.ece
