0,['17/01/2020'],Women Yakshagana performers find prominence on stage,"While Yakshagana remains a gem of Karnataka’s cultural heritage, it is also known that traditionally this performing art form is practised by male artistes only. However, it isn’t the same anymore. A growing number of female artistes are establishing their presence in it, and they are finding prominence too. According to Sushma Mairpady , a 25-year-old engineer, who recently performed in Bengaluru, Coastal Karnataka is abuzz with Yakshagana acts by women, and the trend is now spreading to other parts of the state as well.“I started practising Yakshagana at the age of 10. I was inspired by my father. Those days, only men were seen taking the stage for the all-night dance-drama acts. But now, things are changing,” she says, adding, “It’s quite encouraging to see how so many female artistes are now pursuing this art form with zeal, particularly in Mangaluru, Udupi and Kundapura . Both working women and homemakers are taking time out of their daily routines to perform, even when the shows go on for long hours. And they are respected and supported by their families and society.”Looking back at her 15-year journey in Yakshagana, Sushma says, “As a little girl, I used to practise almost every day at home. This went on until I finished college. There isn’t that kind of time now anymore. However, years of practice make you perfect the craft. As member of travelling troupes, now I can only manage to practise for a few days before the performance. There have also been instances of impromptu acts.”Mostly based on stories of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, these Yakshagana performances are presented in two parts – ‘Teneku Tittu’ and ‘Badagu Tittu’. These comprise two– ‘Draupathi Prathapa’ and ‘ Daksha Dwara ’.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73295201,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-136247/73295201.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/theatre/women-yakshagana-performers-find-prominence-on-stage/articleshow/73294552.cms

The Margazhi music festival is coming to a close and the classical musicians, who’d tirelessly performed for over a month, took a break and played a game of cricket recently.

In this Cricket Kutchery , all the musicians were split into four teams with 11 players in each team. Most of them are passionate about the sport, and so, all of them gave their best shot. The teams held serious discussions, but when playing the game, were all fun and banter.

And somehow, all these ‘firsts’ are interrelated. I think my first-ever professional assignment was for a toy brand. I was very, very young then, and I don’t really remember how it came my way. And a few years later, I did an ad for an energy drink brand when I was in Class IV.My mom’s friend, Krishna, is an ad filmmaker. He thought I was cute enough to do ads and asked my mom to get my portfolio done. There were no managers then and my photos were given to co-ordinators Rukmani aunty and Biju aunty. They would let us know whenever there was a requirement. So, that’s how this energy drink ad happened. On the day I had to shoot the ad, I also had internal assessment at school. My mom wouldn’t allow me to bunk and so, I quickly wrote the test and rushed home after telling my teacher that I had a tummy upset!In my growing up years, I had anchored shows on a kids’ TV channel, and also shot for a short film for DD on pollution. It was like a mini-series, but I don’t think it took off. It was called The Birds Are Coughing, and it was shot by Priya ma’am. Little did I know then that she’d give me my first movie as well — Kanda Naal Mudhal . Somebody had seen my photos and told me that there was an audition happening for a film. When I went there, I was surprised to find out that it was being directed by Priya ma’am. We hadn’t met after the documentary and in the interim, she’d gone to work with Mani Ratnam sir as his assistant on films like Aayitha Ezhuthu (Yuva). So, when she met me, she was super excited and imagine my surprise when she said that she was searching for me all along! She had liked my work in the documentary, and wanted to work with me again. So, I auditioned for the role and before I even reached home, her team called to tell me that I was in and that I had to report to work in the next two days. I was just 14 then, in Class IX. Playing Laila ’s sister was such a fun, crazy experience. I enjoyed acting; I enjoyed being different characters. I like expressing through art, and as I grew up, I understood how art has the ability to make people laugh, cry and experience so many other emotions.

11,['17/01/2020'],5 must-learn commands,"Choose the most valuable reward: The key is to find out what drives your dog a little crazy – it can be a toy, a praise, or a valuable treat. Once you know what works, it can be used to train her/him.

Train your dog at home first: It’s essential to find out whether your pet is comfortable in her environment. So, begin by having his training sessions at home, where he feels secure and safe to give you his undivided attention.

Keep distractions to a minimum: Train him in a place where there are not many distractions so that your intended reward should be the only one



Basic obedience is a must for all canine citizens. More so for pets in cities as they live in confined spaces, and interact with more humans.DOG’S NAMEThe first thing your puppy should learn is her/his name. It means that your pet must respond by looking at you when you call out her/his name. The easiest way to teach that is by offering a treat or praise (read good boy/girl), each time s/he looks at you, regardless of whether you call out your pet’s name or not. Your dog will soon learn that making eye contact is worth her/his while. Once s/he makes eye contact, add the name just prior to him/her making eye contact. Follow it either by a treat or praise. This way, your pet learns that the sound of her/his name, paired with eye contact, results in a treat or praise. Remember not to use her/his name while disciplining, especially when young.COME The ‘Come’ command is one of the most important exercises you must teach your dog. A dog who moves reliably when called can be called out of life-threatening situations like running across roads while chasing another animal/ball... A dog that doesn’t come when called can also get lost if s/he manages to run off from the house or is loose from the leash during a walk.Inside and outside the house, it is important to train your dog to have a reliable recall command. This command allows your dog to be called away from potentially dangerous situations.STAYA dog which can be trusted to stay in a particular spot can be a big help in situations where a door is left open, or a leash or collar breaks during a walk.SITWhile walking on the street, it is a good idea to train your dog to ‘sit’, where a street and sidewalk meet. This way, you will avoid him/her trotting into the street when a vehicle is moving towards him.DOWNPet parents can avoid dangerous situations by asking their dogs to get down when something dangerous approaches them. It gives them time to reach their dogs and save them.Huzannah Banajee is a dog trainer & therapist (with inputs from Delano Henriques, dog trainer, and Malaika Fernandes)Tips to motivate your pet—Malaika Fernandes, canine behaviouristwww.dogsandpupsmagazine.com; www.facebook.com/DogsandpupsmagAre you a proud petparent?

NEW DELHI: Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday urged states to implement the amended Motor Vehicles Act while giving a cold shoulder to demand from Rajasthan to reduce penalties. The minister said only those who violate rules face the risk of paying hefty fines and the improved law is not against law abiding commuters.

Gadkari was responding to a demand from Rajasthan government to reduce traffic fines and penalties under the amended law, which came up at the 39th meeting of Transport Development Council in the national capital. “When it was brought to his notice how one two-wheeler driver was slapped with huge fines, the minister said he was aware about the case. He asked whether such persons who commit multiple offences be allowed to go scot free?” said an official, who was present in the meeting.

Sources said Assam was the only state of those present to commit to implement the central law in totality. They added that transport ministers of other states did not make any comment on the issue.

The minister also warned officials responsible for faulty engineering and road designs of stringent action as road accidents have huge impact on country’s economy. According to an official estimate, the socio-economic loss due to road accidents is pegged at 3% of the GDP of the country.

This is not the first time when Gadkari has taken such a stand. Soon after some of the states had reduced the fines, he had said the local governments would have to answer if fatalities don’t decline in their states.

The transport development council took up issues including harmonisation of road tax across states, guidelines for setting up, authorisation and operation of vehicle scrapping facility and the need to have tourist bus permit system, on the lines of National Permit for trucks, for their seamless movement across the country.

He is alleged to have played a role in over 50 blasts across India and has been serving life term in a jail in Ajmer after being convicted of carrying out blasts in trains on December 5 and 6, 1993 at six locations in Rajasthan.Ansari’s family says he left early Thursday morning for prayers, when he did not return, his family approached the police station assuming that he might be there for his mandatory morning visit. When they did not find him there, police decided to take down a “missing person’s complaint” and recorded statements of Ansari’s family members.

17,['17/01/2020'],More than a hobby: Shopping addiction can be a disorder,"Remember Rebecca Bloomwood from Confessions Of A Shopaholic? The girl was a mess and so was her closet, full of designer clothes that she bought and forgot, and many pairs of shoes that she didn't need. And it's not like she went on a shopping spree because she had loads of money to spare. She continued buying things even while being in some serious credit card debt. Rebecca was addicted to shopping and found it hard to say no to any item that caught her fancy, despite not being able to afford it. Experts say that Rebecca was a compulsive buyer. A person with Compulsive Buying Disorder (CBD) has an excessive preoccupation or poor impulse control with shopping, and studies have suggested that while it may help in relieving stress and tension in short term, in the long term, it can have adverse effects, which include financial stress, anxiety, negative emotions as well as discord with family and friends.According to Delhi-based psychologist Dr Prerna Kohli, some people develop CBD as they essentially get addicted to how their brain feels while shopping. ""CBD is a type of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), which isn't as common as other mental illnesses such as stress, anxiety or depression,"" she says, adding, ""While shopping the brain releases dopamine, also known as the 'feel-good' hormone. Dopamine is a hormone and neurotransmitter that's an important part of the brain's reward system. The pleasure and rush of dopamine is what a CBD patient is looking for.""It is important to note that love for shopping and going on occasional shopping sprees do not mean that one is a compulsive shopper and is suffering from some disorder. Experts say that when any kind of compulsion takes over and becomes an addiction, then it’s a problem. ""These days, people have easy access to shopping. Anyone who is giving in to that impulse, doesn’t necessarily have a disorder. Shopping is not a problem, but if you feel the compulsion to do it, then it’s a problem. If you are spending on things you don’t need and if you’re shopping even when you don’t have money, that’s a real problem,"" says Delhi-based psychologist Dr Harsheen K Arora.Dr Kamna Chhibber, another psychologist from Delhi, adds, ""There's a big difference between having a penchant for shopping and having an outrightcompulsion. People generally say that they are compulsive shoppers, they get these strong urges and they are not able to control it, but are they doing it at the cost of their lives, livelihood or relationships? If the answer is no, then it’s not necessarily CBD.""Contrary to the popular belief, men can be compulsive shoppers, too. Dr Kamna Chhibber shares, ""I worked with this gentleman, who was in his late 30s. He used to engage in a lot of compulsive shopping. His mother had a similar habit.

If a person has anxiety, depression or bipolar disorder, or any existing comorbid condition, this behaviour is co-existent with it. Low self-esteem can also be something that leads to this.

Saqib Saleem with Mohinder Amarnath

Kabir Khan's sports drama film 'is nearing release now. The film tells the story of the Indian cricket team's iconic World Cup win in 1983. Ranveer Singh , who plays the winning captain Kapil Dev , has begun sharing character looks on his social media and recently, he shared the look of Saqib Saleem , who is essaying the role of all-rounder Mohinder Amarnath . Mohinder – or Jimmy to the fans – was the architect of the Indian win with Man of the Match performances in both the semi-final and final. While the actors and the film crew are waiting to see how the public will react to the film, the players themselves are also excited.Speaking to us on the sidelines of a cricket event in Delhi last year, Amarnath had said he is looking forward to the film and hopes that it will stay true to the Indian team's journey. ""I am looking forward to it (the film),"" he said, adding, ""It was a great triumph of the underdog and I hope the film can capture that feeling. When we started the campaign, people thought we’d be there just for formalities. In fact, lot of players in the Indian team had planned holidays, but once we started doing well, we all clicked at the right time. But the press gave us no chance, which helped us. When you are the underdog, there is no pressure.""The World Cup hero spent some time with the film's team when they trained in Dharamshala last April.

19,['17/01/2020'],"Remembering SUCHITRA SEN, Bengal’s QUEEN of HEARTS!","In life, as in death, Suchitra Sen remains an enigma. The dusky, elegant beauty with an enchanting smile, marched into the celluloid like Colossus. Her vibrant, romantic appearance used to send the audience into a tizzy. Her unmatchable performances stole many a million hearts. That’s how you describe Suchitra Sen, the graceful chapter of India’s tinsel town. On her 6death anniversary, we take a look at the Mahanayika’s stardom to reclusive journey.Born as Roma Dasgupta, on April 6, 1931, in Pabna district (now in Bangladesh), the enigmatic beauty did her schooling at a local high school but because of the Partition in 1947 the Dasgupta family had to migrate to West Bengal. That same year, Suchitra stepped into an early marriage with Dibanath Sen, son of then famous industrialist Adinath Sen and it all started from that period.Dibanath was surprised to find out his wife’s terrific acting talent early in their marriage life and encouraged Suchitra Sen to start a career for herself. He brought in an iconic filmmaker Bimal Roy, whose late sister was incidentally Adinath Sen’s first wife. It was Bimal Roy who introduced her to another noted director of that time Sukumar Dasgupta. After a formal screen test Sukumar launched the aspiring actress in his film ‘Saat Nombor Koyedi’. Not many people know one of Sukumar Dasgupta’s assistants gave the young actress her iconic screen name ‘Suchitra’ and rest his history. In 1953 Suchitra Sen signed several films including ‘Kajori’, ‘Sharey Chuattar’ and ‘Bhagawan Sri Sri Krishna Chaitanya’. Suchitra and Dibanath’s only child Moon Moon Sen was born next year. However, the ambitious actress managed to juggle between her motherhood with film career like a pro.Many believe the turning point in her budding career was the cult classic ‘Sharey Chuattar’ as it became a super hit. This comedy caper directed by Nirmal Dey had legendary actors like Tulsi Chakraborty, Molina Devi, Bhanu Bandopadhyay , Jahar Roy and many more. The most significant point is Uttam Kumar , for whom it was debut film, was successfully paired with Suchitra to pave the way for a golden era. From this point, literally there was no looking back for both of them.For the next two decades or so, the celebrated pair ruled Bengali cinema. Incidentally, among the 60 odd films in which Suchitra Sen appeared, 30 films saw Uttam Kumar as the male lead. In fact, Uttam soon emerged as the heartthrob of Bengal along with the romantic and melodramatic Suchitra Sen. Their landmark films include ‘Saptapadi’, ‘Shilpi’, ‘Har Mana Har’,’ Indrani’, ‘Chaawa Paawa’, ‘Shapmochan’ and ‘Suryatoran’ among many others. These cult classics used to enjoy jam-packed cinema halls on a regular basis. During the 50’s and 60s, serpentine queues for tickets in advance for Uttam-Suchitra films were a common phenomenon. The unmatchable fandom of this iconic pair set a benchmark in the history of Bengali cinema and it remains unchallenged till today.Suchitra Sen achieved her first international success in 1963 when she received the Best Actress award for ‘Saptapadi’ at the Moscow International Film Festival. She became the first Indian actress to have this honour! Another of her record-setting movie was ‘ Uttar Falguni ’ where she played a double role of courtesan Pannabai and her barrister daughter Suparna. She was flooded with congratulations and rave reviews for essaying out the stereotypical mother ready to go to any extent to offer her offspring a dignified life.One more landmark film ‘Saat Paake Bandha’ guided Suchitra Sen into the limelight once again. Here she was cast opposite another acting legend Soumitra Chatterjee. The matinee idol reflected the agonies of a young wife torn between her idealist husband and her rich, dominating mother so aptly that the audience was left in awe. The climax of the film where the wife tears off her husband’s vest in a moment of glory remains attached with the minds of Suchitra Sen’s fans even today. This one too won another award at the Moscow Film Festival.The legendary actress stepped into Bollywood under the guidance of Bimal Roy who decided to cast her in his blockbuster ‘Devdas’ and she excelled in her role sharing the screen with the then superstars Dilip Kumar and Vaijyanthimala. Her grace and immaculate style gave her the opportunity to shine in ‘Bombai Ka Baboo’ opposite the evergreen Dev Anand. However, Suchitra Sen’s most famous Bollywood film is Gulzaar’s ‘Aandhi’ which followed a woman politician’s dilemma between her political and personal life. It created a storm throughout the nation as the storyline had an uncanny resemblance with the life and career of Indira Gandhi. She eventually received a nomination for Best Actress for her sensitive performance in ‘Aandhi’. Sadly, she missed the opportunity to work with the Titans of contemporary Bengali cinema at that time like Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak and Mrinal Sen . Though Ray once tried to cast her but things didn’t work out. In 1972, Suchitra Sen was conferred with the prestigious Padmashree award.Although Dibanath Sen had taken all the initiative to launch his wife’s film career once, yet her increasing popularity and stardom saw them drift apart. It was November 1969 when the news came - Dibanath has died in a car accident in the US.After this disaster Suchitra Sen surprising everyone went into a self-imposed oblivion as she detached herself entirely from all the public appearances and contacts. Consequently, the film fraternity and media started to compare her with Greta Garbo, the mysterious Hollywood star. To stick with her obscurity, in 2005 she even refused the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award. Then it was January 17, 2014 – the day when Suchitra Sen walked into the sunset. Till date, the elusive mystifying queen of Bengali cinema lives on in millions of her fans’ hearts.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73297821,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-346394/73297821.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/bengali/movies/news/remembering-suchitra-sen-bengals-queen-of-hearts/articleshow/73297704.cms

Well, the actor posed nude for the shoot Reyaansh tells BT, “Amit Khanna, the photographer, approached me with this bold concept, which is based on the story of the emperor’s new clothes. The idea was to replicate the popular tale of an emperor, who roamed around nude with his loyal subjects praising him, until his son told him that he wasn’t wearing anything. I had to pose nude for the shoot and then get suited up for another picture. The two were then merged to emphasise the theme.”The actor admits that he was apprehensive about ‘ baring it all’ in front of the camera. He says, “I was hesitant initially, but then, I realised that it was an opportunity to explore myself and break free of inhibitions. I don’t think that it will hamper my screen image, as the shoot has been done aesthetically.”Given the nature of the shoot, Reyaansh had to follow a strict diet and fitness regime before the shoot. “I would work out twice a day.

NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday played down the $1 billion investment promised by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, saying the money was meant to cover the losses that the e-commerce player had notched up in the country and it was not “doing a favour”.The minister’s statement at the Raisina Dialogue came a day after the Amazon CEO announced a fresh $1 billion investment in India to digitise small businesses in the country as part of an initiative to get them to sell on the marketplace .“I have on more than one occasion said this to the people of India that please follow the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. Don’t try to find loopholes. They may have put in $1 billion, but if they make a loss of $1 billion every year then they jolly well have to finance that $1 billion. It is not as if they are not doing a great favour to India when they invest $ 1 billion,” the minister said at the event.He then went on to reiterate that e-commerce companies that were allowed to operate through the marketplace model, and barred from multi-brand retail, needed to adhere to the rules “in letter and spirit”.Just last week, Competition Commission of India, the country’s fairplay watchdog, ordered a probe to see if the two big e-tailers, Amazon and rival Flipkart , were operating in line with Indian competition rules. The probe came days before Bezos landed in India. Government officials, including Goyal, cold-shouldered overtures from Amazon to meet Bezos during his visit to the country.Small traders are up in arms against global retail giants, saying they are under-cutting their businesses leading to job losses and have demanded a level-playing field.“They are investing money over the last few years in warehousing and certain other activities, which is welcome and very good... in a fair marketplace model if on a turnover of $10 billion you are going to have a loss of $1 billion, it certainly raises questions over where the loss came from. How can a marketplace make such a big loss, unless they are indulging in predatory pricing, or some unfair trade practices?” Goyal said, adding that the authorities probing allegations of wrong-doing by companies such as Amazon and Flipkart will look into it.Although the minister was attacked on social media for the statement, Confederation of All India Traders, which has been behind protests against Amazon and Flipkart by local traders, lauded the “bold and pragmatic” statement. “With this stand the minister has once again reiterated that the government is sensitive to the interests of seven crore traders of India who are severely affected by the malpractices of e-commerce giants,” CAIT president Praveen Khandelwal said in a statement.“We have very strict rules about FDI in multi-brand retail, where only 49% (FDI) is allowed and anybody who tries to use the marketplace model to get into the multi-brand retail space surreptitiously, will have to be questioned and will have to be investigated. Whether they are doing that or not is a matter for the investigators to decide,” Goyal said.He also said India and the US are in an “advanced stage” of dialogue to resolve some of the pressing trade issues. He said that both the countries can expand their trade relations which in future may result in a preferential or a free trade agreement.In Video: Amazon not doing India a favour: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73311353,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-290567,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/piyush-goyal-amazon-investing-to-cover-losses-not-doing-india-a-favour/articleshow/73311341.cms
25,['17/01/2020'],Rakesh Wadhawan: Supreme Court stays HC order to shift promoters of HDIL from jail,"This story is from January 17, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed a Bombay high court order releasing HDIL promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and his son Sarang, accused in Rs 4,355 crore PMC Bank scam, from Arthur Road prison and putting them in custody at their residences with two guards each to facilitate the sale of their assets for recovery of investors’ money.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta mentioned the Enforcement Directorate ’s appeal against the high court’s order before a bench of CJ S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant , who were initially posting it for hearing on Friday. However, Mehta convinced them about the urgency of the situation and said the high court had passed the order on a PIL and even allowed the Wadhawans to travel for the purpose of sale of assets.

The bench allowed the ED’s appeal to be registered, took up the matter an hour after the SG sought urgent hearing and stayed that part of the HC order which directed shifting of the Wadhawans from prison to their residences. The ED alleged that various officials of PMC Bank, along with the promoters and executives of real estate firm HDIL, were in criminal conspiracy, leading to disbursement of loans in a fraudulent manner and falsification of account books. “Such a relief (by the HC) could not have been granted in a PIL when the accused persons were in judicial custody in relation to a serious bank fraud of more than Rs 4,355 crore,” the ED said.

Mehta clarifiedthat the ED had no grievance against the HC decision to constitute a three-member panel headed by former SC judge K S Radhakrishnan for sale of assets of accused persons.

27,['17/01/2020'],"Reflect on global consensus, don’t raise Kashmir issue: India to China","This story is from January 17, 2020

NEW DELHI: After discussions on Kashmir at UNSC once again ended without an outcome, India on Thursday pointedly asked China to “reflect on the global consensus” that India and Pakistan resolve all outstanding issues bilaterally and refrain from raising the Kashmir issue at the forum.

With China’s third attempt to embarrass India at the behest of its ally Pakistan running aground, India said it was time Beijing drew “proper lessons” as most UNSC member-states, including UK and Russia , agreed during discussions on bilateralism as the way forward in addressing India-Pakistan issues.

The ministry of external affairs also directed some advice at Islamabad, saying, “Pakistan can avoid this global embarrassment time and again by putting their energy in something constructive.”

UK’s role, in fact, was a revelation as, according to officials, there was a discernible change since last August when it had disappointed India. As an official source said, UK permanent representative Karen Pierce at least twice intervened in favour of the argument that India and Pakistan address the issue bilaterally.

China has been looking to rake up Kashmir since India’s decision to revoke the special status of J&K. “Pakistan’s practice of using false pretenses to distract from addressing the malaise that afflicts it has run its course today,” said India permanent representative to UN Syed Akbaruddin .

MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar here said China should draw proper lessons and refrain from taking such action in future, adding an effort was made by Pakistan through a member of the UNSC to again “misuse the platform of UNSC” for discussing a bilateral matter.

Majority of the UNSC members were of the view that the Council is not the right forum for such issues and this should be discussed bilaterally between India and Pakistan, he said.

NEW DELHI/HYDERABAD: The CBI has filed an FIR against Adani Enterprises Ltd and a former chairman and an ex-managing director of the National Cooperative Consumer Federation (NCCF) alleging irregularities in the selection of a company for supply of coal to power stations in Andhra Pradesh .

The FIR named Adani Enterprises, former NCCF chairman Virender Singh, its former managing director G P Gupta and its senior advisor S C Singhal as accused. They have been charged with criminal conspiracy, cheating and under provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act.

The FIR said the accused “committed irregularities by way of manipulation in the selection of bidders, thereby giving undue favour to Adani Enterprises Ltd in award of work for supply of imported coal to APGENCO despite its disqualification”. The agency alleged that acts of “omission and commission” by NCCF officers showed that they acted in “a manner unbecoming of public servants” and conspired with the company.

A spokesperson for Adani group said, “There is a news item about lodging of an FIR by CBI against NCCF and Adani Enterprises Ltd related to supply of imported coal. The subject matter is an old one. Adani Enterprises Ltd has complied with the process, all formalities and relevant laws for the supply of coal. The company has not done anything wrong in supply of coal. It’s a preliminary investigation report only. The company shall respond to the same and shall also put forth the factual position to the authority.”

According to the FIR, the Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation (APGENCO) had floated a limited tender enquiry for the supply of 6 lakh tonnes of imported coal via sea ports to Narla Tata Rao thermal power plant in Vijayawada and the Rayalaseema Thermal Power Plant (RTPP) in Kadapa on June 29, 2010. The tender was forwarded to seven public sector units including NCCF, a multi-state cooperative under the Union consumer affairs ministry which has 78% government stake, the FIR said.

The CBI alleged that NCCF’s Hyderabad unit, which had received the APGENCO tender enquiry on June 29, 2010, had forwarded it to Singhal in its Delhi headquarters. “The same day, the head office selected a single party — Maharishi Brothers Coal Limited (MBCL) — to transport the coal at a margin of 2.25% instead of initiating the process for floating an open tender to call for bids from competitive bidders citing lack of time as the deadline was July 7,” the FIR said.

On July 7, APGENCO informed NCCF, Hyderabad, that the date of tender had been extended to July 12 following which allocation to MBCL was cancelled and an open tender was floated, it added.

“It is pertinent to mention here that before extension of the date of tender, they had seven days (July 1, 2010 to July 7, 2010) and after extension of date they had five days only (July 8 to July 12, 2010) but now management felt that they had sufficient time to call open tender,” the FIR said. The draft tender notice was discussed and approved by three senior officials of NCCF — Singhal, Gupta and Singh — who ignored guidelines without consulting the head office level committee, CBI claimed.

Six bidders — Adani Enterprises, MBCL, Vyom Trade Links, Swarana Projects, Gupta Coal India and Kyori Oremin — responded to the NCCF tender on July 10, 2010, whose details and bids were tabulated and sent to the headquarters by the Hyderabad unit the same day, the FIR said.

“Gupta Coal had quoted 11.3% NCCF margin while MBCL had kept it at 2.25% but the remaining companies had not quoted any NCCF margin. Bids of Gupta Coal, Kyori Oremin and Swarana Projects were rejected by NCCF as they did not fulfil tender conditions,” the FIR said.

“Instead of cancelling the bid of Adani Enterprises Ltd, senior management of NCCF conveyed the offer margin of NCCF to the company through one of its representatives Munish Sehgal who was sitting in the NCCF head office on July 10, 2010 in the evening,” the FIR said.

Have done nothing wrong: Adani group

A spokesperson for the Adani group on Thursday said, “The subject matter is an old one. Adani Enterprises Ltd has complied with the process, all formalities and relevant laws for the supply of coal. The company has not done anything wrong in supply of coal. It’s a prelim inary investigation report only. The company shall respond to the same and shall also put forth the factual position to the authority.”

29,['17/01/2020'],Such pinpricks will sow division among allies: Mallikarjun Kharge on Sanjay Raut,"This story is from January 17, 2020

NEW DELHI: As a fresh row raged between allies over Shiv Sena leader’s comment about Indira Gandhi , Congress in-charge of Maharashtra, Mallikarjun Kharge , warned that such pinpricks will sow division among partners who should remember that they have come together to keep the BJP out of power because of its divisive politics.

On Thursday, Kharge said he telephoned Maharashtra Congress chief and state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat to convey this advice-message to Shiv Sena leadership. As a result, Raut expressed regret and withdrew his comment that “Indira Gandhi used to meet Karim Lala”.

In the fledgling ruling alliance of Maharashtra, comprising NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress, it was yet another controversy triggered by comments of a partner, the remark about Savarkar by Rahul Gandhi having touched off a similar confrontation earlier.

Speaking to TOI, Kharge said, “Such things are not good for alliance. We should not speak the language of dividing each other. We have a common minimum programme of governance. We should focus on CMP rather than talking about past stories. If we talk about past, so many things will come out.”

The senior AICC functionary expressed satisfaction that Raut had expressed regret but added tersely, “We are not there just to get abused. We came together to keep BJP away from power. We may have our likes or dislikes but we are there for a reason. BJP is raking up non-issues in the name of patriotism. But we should not rake up non-issues. If allies speak like this, the government cannot deliver.”

Kharge said people of Maharashtra have accepted the three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi which they believe will deliver for the common man. “Their expectations are high. So, let us work unitedly to strengthen the government and the CMP. We expect all allies to stick to this line,” he said.

The consternation in Congress over Raut’s comment could be understood by the stern message sent by the AICC to its state leadership, a reason why Congress’s cabinet ministers in Uddhav Thackeray ministry came out full throttle against the “attack on Indira Gandhi”.

Congress leaders were optimistic that the row would die down and Sena would be careful in future. Despite the row, party managers have found considerable softening in the Sena ranks, evident in how Aaditya Thackeray met Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday and how he personally invited party chief Sonia Gandhi for the swearing-in ceremony of his father in November.

A senior leader said Sena broke away from its old ally BJP for “power and chief ministership” and “is cognisant of this reality”.

30,['17/01/2020'],"SC ignored, death-row prisoners segregated","This story is from January 17, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court committee on prison reforms surveyed jails in 12 major states and found 222 prisoners on death row, including four in the Nirbhaya case, and said except Jharkhand, all other states had a policy of segregating such prisoners from other inmates in flagrant violation of repeated SC rulings since 1978.

The 170-page report of the prison reforms committee headed by retired SC judge Amitava Roy, which was recently placed before a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde through amicus curiae Gaurav Agrawal, said, “Except Jharkhand, all other states have a policy for segragation of death row convicts from other inmates.” The committee surveyed prisons of Assam , Bihar, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka , Kerala , Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

It said the policy to segregate condemned prisoners from other inmates was in violation of landmark decisions of the SC, starting with the Sunil Batra case judgment in 1978. In that case, the SC had said that “death row convicts cannot be segregated” and that they are “entitled to the amenities of ordinary inmates in prison like games, books, newspapers, reasonably good food, the right to expression - artistic or other, normal clothing and bed”.

In Ajay Kumar Pal case in 2014, the SC had ruled that a convict sentenced to death could not be segregated till his/her mercy petition to the President was disposed of. “Segregating a prisoner before that would be a complete transgression of the right under Article 21... causing incalculable harm to the prisoner,” it had said.

Last year, while dealing with inhuman condition in prisons, the SC had said, “There is no difference between a separate cell and solitary confinement. Therefore, a convict on death row is entitled to move within the confines of the prison like any other convict undergoing rigorous imprisonment. However, certain restrictions may be necessary for security reasons, but even then, it would be necessary to comply with natural justice.”

The Model Prison Manual, 2016, recommended segregation of each convict sentenced to death (whether or not the sentence of death has been confirmed by the high court) from the date of his admission to a prison, the committee said in its report. However, it pointed out that Delhi Prison Rules, 2018, adopted a more humane approach by stipulating that segregation of a death row convict would be effected when all legal remedies were exhausted and the convict was under a finally executable death sentence.

This means, the Nirbhaya case convicts, who have moved mercy petitions before the President after dismissal of their curative pleas by the SC, could not be kept under segregation and can avail facilities like education, legal, sports, canteen, interviews, labour, remission etc which are available to other prisoners.

The committee also found that of the 12 states, only Delhi and Kerala allocated work to all death row convicts lodged in their prisons, while in other states, only 25% of condemned prisoners were allocated work. “J&K and Karnataka have no policy for allocation of work to death row convicts, which is a violation of the fundamental right,” it said.

Of the 222 condemned prisoners, Maharashtra houses the highest (71), followed by Uttar Pradesh (27), Bihar and Karnataka (22 each), West Bengal and Kerala (18 each), Jharkhand (15) and Delhi (12). Of the 222, appeals against death sentence of 139 convicts are pending in the SC (31) and HCs (108).

32,['17/01/2020'],Imran Khan will get invite for SCO summit: Govt,"This story is from January 17, 2020

NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday confirmed that it would invite Pakistani PM Imran Khan along with other heads of governments of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) nations for the annual meeting of the Central Asia group dominated by Russia and China.

The invitation is on expected lines as both India and Pakistan are now full members of the SCO and the Pakistani leader could not have been overlooked. While there is no word on a bilateral meeting or lack of it, this will be Khan’s first visit to India after becoming the PM in August 2018. It has been a tumultuous time for India-Pakistan ties since then with the attack on a convoy in Pulwama in February 2019, carried out by Pakistan-backed Jaish, resulting in the deaths of 40 CRPF personnel.

The Pulwama terror attack led to an IAF strike on a jihadi training camp in Balakot in Pakistan on February 26 and the failed attempt at retaliation by the Pakistan air force the next day.

The Modi government, which returned to office in May 2019, has avoided re-engagement, insisting on Islamabad addressing terrorist organisations targeting India from its soil. Ties headed further south with Modi 2.0 moving quickly to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, making it clear that the state was fully integrated with the rest of the country, leading Pakistan to launch a diplomatic offensive with limited results.

MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said all eight member countries, four observers and dialogue partners of the grouping would be invited for the meeting, which will be held later this year. “The meeting is held annually at the PM’s level and it discusses SCO’s programme and multilateral economic and trade cooperation,” he said at a media briefing.

“As per the established practice and procedure within SCO, all eight members of the SCO, as well as four observer states and other international dialogue partners will be invited to attend the meeting,” Kumar said when asked whether Khan would be sent an invitation. Sources later said the invite should not be seen as a dilution of India’s position that no dialogue with Pakistan was possible in the current circumstances. For the first time, India will host the annual meeting of the council of heads of government of SCO, the bloc’s secretary general Vladimir Norov had said on Monday.

The government’s announcement on inviting Pakistan to the event came in the middle of continuing tensions, with Islamabad also attacking the Citizenship Amendment Act, which offers citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis, Jains and Christians, who fled Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh due to religious persecution. India and Pakistan became full members of the China-dominated grouping in 2017.

33,['17/01/2020'],"Kirana store to B’wood, Bezos feels Mumbai’s pulse","This story is from January 17, 2020

No matter what the analysts tell you, brick and mortar stores are here to stay. At least for as long as Jeff Bezos needs to cook. The wealthiest man in the world who introduced the world to online shopping carts is often found walking the aisles of a grocery store in the suburbs of Seattle, pushing that metal wire cart loaded with all that he needs to indulge his passion for cooking. “I’m not a good cook but I like to cook. I just like to walk the aisles of a grocery store without a plan and then put together a meal,” said Bezos, on his first trip to Mumbai on Wednesday.

But Bezos’s love for the physical store isn’t limited to his own pleasures. The founder of the world’s largest online retail giant has been courting neighbourhood mom-and-pop stores in the country as delivery agents or to sell products through them as part of their strategy. “In fact, I just visited a tiny kirana store today which was an incredible experience. They do regular business but they also provide a space for online packages. I met this young man who helps his parents run the store and how its improved their lives to have this extra source of income was a moving experience,” said Bezos while fielding questions from actor Shah Rukh Khan and filmmaker Zoya Akhtar at a gathering of members from the Indian film industry.

For Bezos, who has been to India three times since he made his first trip 11 years ago, “there haven’t been perceptible changes of great magnitude,” he says. But it is for those reasons that he finds the country endearing. “Certain things are the same and I love those things. Every time I come here I see so much energy, dynamism and colour… everywhere you go and everything that you do, I’ve never seen more diversity in the world. Also, everybody here seems to be focused on self improvement. I get a boost of energy. I’m like wow, it’s so alive here.”

The centi-billionaire worth $115.5bn did not perfect his winning formula right at the outset, though. “I wanted to be an archaeologist and that was pre-Indiana Jones. Then I went to college wanting to be a physicist but realised half way through I wanted to pursue computer science which became my greatest passion and that’s how I ended up doing what I do,” he recounted.

Clearly, time isn’t something that Bezos has on his hands, one would imagine but the man who at 56, is perhaps more occupied than most people are in the prime of their lives, dismisses the thought. “There’s this false idea that CEOS are under the most stress. No, but why? I’m a CEO and when you’re in charge you can delegate your stress. It’s not hard work that people dislike, it’s being out of control and I hate being over scheduled,” is how he put it.

If it’s his grandparents that Bezos considers his greatest influence, it is an unlikely item in his wardrobe that he credits as his “lucky” charm. “A pair of flashy Texan cowboy boots with red stars that you’ll see me wearing every time we send a rocket into the sky,” said Bezos, the space-obsessed cofounder of an aerospace company who revealed that the alien official in the last Star Trek film was “indeed me”.

34,['17/01/2020'],2 students attacked on Visva-Bharati campus,"This story is from January 17, 2020

SANTINIKETAN: Several persons attacked two students with cricket stumps at a boys’ hostel on the Visva-Bharati campus on Wednesday night.

Santiniketan Police arrested two of the suspected attackers – Achintya Bagdi and Saber Ali – and produced them in a Bolpur court on Thursday morning and pressed attempt-to-murder charge against them, apart from other non-bailable penal offences.

VB PRO Anirban Sarkar said there was a clash between two student groups on Wednesday night; no political reason was found to trigger it. “The security officer, proctor and other officials rushed to the hostel and brought the situation under control,” he said.

Left-backed Students’ Federation of India (SFI) claimed that the victims — Swapnonil Mukhopadhyay and Debabrata Nath — were its members. SFI Visva-Bharati unit leader Somnath Sau claimed Bagdi was an ABVP supporter and that the attack was a fallout of the demonstration Left students had held during Raya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta ’s visit to the campus on January 8.

ABVP’s Birbhum coordinator Ramesh Pramanik rubbished the claims. He said: “Neither Bagdi nor Saber is attached to ABVP. It is surprising that Left supporters are accusing our workers of the attack. None of our workers was present during the incident. I have heard the clash broke out over an apolitical matter. Left supporters started blaming ABVP for publicity.”

Trinamool Congress Chatra Parishad (TMCP)’s Birbhum president Suranjan Chatterjee said: “Bagdi is our member and he leads our activities at Visva-Bharati.” He, however, added: “A group of Left supporters from outside, probably Jadavpur University , tried to enter the boys’ hostel. When our workers protested, a scuffle broke out between the two groups.”

Bagdi too admitted as much, saying “we had gone to rescue Sulabh Karmakar, a Trinamool member, who was beaten up and left bleeding profusely”. He was speaking to reporters while stepping out of the court lock-up.

Bengal education minister Partha Chatterjee said ABVP had been carrying out attacks in institutes across the country to suppress democratic protests, and the VB incident was the latest instance.

MEERUT: Thirty-three local residents who received notices of recovery from the local administration have responded to it, claiming that they were not involved in rioting that took place in the district on December 20.

Office of the additional district magistrate had sent notices to 46 suspects claimed to have been involved in the rioting. As per the directions, a process of recovering damage to the private and public property began after the names of the suspects cropped up in the police investigation.

The statements of all 33 were recorded by officials and now the further process has been started into the matter, said sources. According to additional district magistrate Amit Singh , “We have received 33 responses so far, in which the accused and their family members have denied any involvement in violence and damaging properties. Further investigation is on and we will now match the photos of the accused, which were provided by the police, with their identity cards. If photos match, action will be taken against them. Action could also be taken against the family members, who have denied the accused’s involvement in the violence.”

A total of 46 notices had been served to protesters for anti-CAA violence in Muzaffarnagar district two weeks ago, the ADM’s office had confirmed. The notices did not mention any specific recovery amount. But, the “rioters” have been asked to appear in person before the ADM’s court to record their statements within seven days.

Sources said that the local administration had asked police to provide details of the alleged offenders who took part in damaging properties and vehicles after Friday prayers on December 20. Now, police have provided names and addresses of 46 individuals.

36,['17/01/2020'],"SC rejects telcos’ plea to review verdict on payment of Rs 92,000 crore to Centre","This story is from January 17, 2020

NEW DELHI: In a blow to telecom companies, the Supreme Court on Thursday refused to re-examine its verdict by which it had directed them to pay around Rs 92,000 crore as licence fee and penalty along with interest based on the revenue-sharing model from 2004 till 2015.

A bench of Justices Arun Mishra, S Abdul Nazeer and M R Shah dismissed the review petitions filed by Bharti Airtel , Vodafone Idea, Tata Teleservices and other companies after examining their plea in chamber. “Having perused the review petitions and connected papers with meticulous care, we do not find any justifiable reason to entertain the review petitions. The review petitions are, accordingly, dismissed,” the bench said in its order.

The telecom companies had earlier pleaded that their review petition be heard in open court and they be given a chance to convince the bench to re-examine the verdict. The bench refused the plea and dismissed their petition in the in-chamber proceedings. The last recourse for the companies, which have expressed inability to deposit the amount, is to file a curative petition to get any relief from the court.

The apex court had on October 24 allowed the Centre to recover around Rs 92,000 crore from telecom operators while dismissing their plea that adjusted gross revenue (AGR), on the basis of which fee is paid by them to the Centre, should include only core telecom services, excluding revenue from other sources. It had accepted the Centre’s contention that AGR should include dividends, handset sales, rent and profit from the sale of scrap, apart from revenue from services.

Initially, 15% AGR was fixed as licence fee under revenue sharing, which was reduced to 13% and lastly to 8% in 2013. Almost all telecom operators — Airtel, Vodafone, Idea, RCoM, Aircel, BSNL and MTNL — will feel the pinch of the apex court verdict.

“The definition of gross revenue is crystal clear in the agreement. How the adjusted gross revenue is to be arrived at is also evident. It cannot be submitted that the revenue has not been defined in the contract. Once the gross revenue is defined, one cannot depart from it and the very meaning is to be given to the revenue for the agreement,” the bench said, adjudicating the dispute between the Centre and telecom companies that has been going on since 2003.

The court had said the companies had not only to pay licence fee but will have to shell out interest and penalty for delaying payment. It had held that each and every source of revenue be part of AGR. It said discounts allowed on international roaming to consumers, commission and discount to distributors on sale of prepaid vouchers are also part of the gross revenue.

The court further said gains from foreign exchange fluctuations, monetary gains on sale of shares, insurance claim in respect of capital assets, amount of negative balance of prepaid customers, reimbursement of the infrastructure operating expenses, waiver of late fee and non-refundable deposits paid to subscribers are all part of gross revenue and licence fee must be paid taking all of them in account.

Refusing to grant any relief to the companies to waive off penalty and interest, the court said, “No litigant can be permitted to reap fruits on such inconsistent and untenable stands and litigate for decades in several rounds which is not so uncommon but is disturbing scenario projected in very many cases.”

38,['17/01/2020'],"Money for statue, but not for poor: Bombay HC slams Maharashtra","This story is from January 17, 2020

MUMBAI: Referring to the plight of patients at the twin Wadia hospitals in Mumbai’s Parel due to freeze of grants, the Bombay high court on Thursday slammed the state government, saying it has money to build Dr B R Ambedkar’s statue but not to spend on the poor and middle class who cannot afford treatment at “star” hospitals.

The comment came a day after the state cabinet raised the cost of the Ambedkar memorial project at Dadar’s Indu Mills by Rs 300 crore, taking it to Rs 1,070 crore to account for a 100ft increase in the icon’s statue to 350ft. “For that (statue), money is there, but the same people Ambedkar represented all his life can die. They need medical aid or statues?” asked the bench of Justices Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Riyaz Chagla while hearing a public interest litigation to release grants by the state and BMC to the Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital and Bai Jerbai Wadia Hospital for Children. While the state and BMC share 50% of the grant to the maternity hospital, BMC funds 85% of the grant to the children’s hospital.

Advocate Girish Godbole , for the state government, said the finance department has sanctioned Rs24 crore from the contingent fund and it will be given in lumpsum within three weeks. “This is an eyewash. This, to materialize, will take months. Tomorrow this amount should be released,” said Justice Dharmadhikari, adding that otherwise, right from the state chief secretary to the deputy secretary, “we will parade them here (in court). You want that?”

Godbole also said the government will scrutinise if the maternity hospital’s other claims are genuine and added that in “the administration some are drawing salary from the two establishments.” He also said “amounts claimed are inflated.” Senior advocate Rafiq Dada, for the hospitals, said all accounts are audited. “They (officials) used to come to meet you (Wadia) for a cup of tea,” said Justice Dharmadhikari.

Dada said salaries are not paid. He said there are 300 critical beds and a total of 800 beds in both hospitals. “Critical patients are not being admitted. It is very distressing,” Dada said.

The judges even didn’t spare CM Uddhav Thackeray , who on Wednesday launched the first girder of the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link. “You have time to inaugurate schemes…time to go and inaugurate a bridge which is yet to be built. We are thankful to the CM for finding time to meet them (all stakeholders),” Justice Dharmadhikari said.

The BMC’s advocate Suresh Pakale said its balance payment is over Rs14 crore towards the children’s hospital, and it will release it. On Friday, the state government will inform when the amount will be disbursed. “Common man you can take for a ride. Not us,” said Justice Dharmadhikari.

NEW DELHI: The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has set up an advisory board to serve as a first level of examination in cases of banking and financial frauds above Rs 50 crore in state-run banks and financial institutions — a move which is expected to ease the fear of investigative agencies among officials and get the wheels of lending moving.The panel will review cases of financial fraud involving general managers in state-run banks and financial institutions before any action is initiated by the organisations involved.The five-member panel headed by T M Bhasin, ex-chairman & managing director of Indian Bank and a former vigilance commissioner, will also provide advice on all cases of financial fraud under the relevant laws.The move comes after experts and industry leaders flagged the concerns during their recent meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, where they cited instances of investigative agencies hounding the corporate sector and bankers.For instance, Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra is learned to have pointed to the CBI booking Carnation founder Jagdish Khattar , the former Maruti chief, for a loan fraud as a case where genuine business failure was being punished.Similarly, Bharti Group chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal had also flagged this as a concern, which came weeks after Rahul Bajaj raised the issue of “fear” in corporate India before home minister Amit Shah, who was present at the annual ET Awards with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal .During a separate closed-door meeting with the PM, bankers and market experts, the issue of bank chiefs being made personally liable for loans turning bad was raised, with some bank chiefs suggesting that decision-making had come to a halt as they did not want to face action for genuine business decisions.Modi had assured that honest bank officers would be shielded from investigative agencies in cases of bona fide business decisions. Nirmala Sitharaman, too, had sought to comfort bankers over their fears of arbitrary action by investigative agencies and had invited CBI chief RK Shukla for a meeting with bank chiefs last month.The new panel is an improvement on a committee under Bhasin, which was set up last August. The CVC had set up the advisory board on banking frauds after consultations with the RBI based on the recommendations of the expert committee on NPAs and frauds.“Now, in view of the increasing complexities and issues arising or difficulties being faced in technical matters, it has been decided to rename the board as advisory board for banking and financial frauds,” the CVC order said. State vigilance commissions have also been advised to follow a similar approach.The government is keen to ensure speedy decision-making and accelerate bank lending to boost overall economic growth, which is estimated to slow to 5% in 2019-20, the slowest pace in 11 years.A CVC order said all public sector banks and financial institutions shall refer all matters of suspected fraud of over Rs 50 crore linked to public servants equivalent to the rank of general manager and above to the board for advice before initiating an inquiry or investigation.It said all administrative ministries, organisations and entities of the government shall ensure that the advice of the board has been sought and made available to the investigative agencies, which may take such advice into account while initiating an action or preliminary inquiry.In case during the course of the investigation, the involvement of a public servant above the rank of GM comes to the notice of the investigative agency, they may refer the matter to the board for advice before proceeding further.Apart from Bhasin, other members on the board are former urban development secretary Madhusudan Prasad, former Border Security Force director general D K Pathak and Andhra Bank former MD & CEO Suresh Patel. The fifth slot would be filled with an expert from the financial sector.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73318491,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-70922,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cvc-panel-to-vet-fraud-cases-of-over-rs-50-crore/articleshow/73313216.cms

PNG in the city is being supplied under the Patna City Gas Distribution Scheme

PATNA: Around 11,000 households in the state capital are now connected with the piped natural gas (PNG) network while 700 households are already getting piped supply of cooking gas, the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) has said.

“About 150km gas pipeline has been laid in Patna in the past one year,” a GAIL official said, adding, that 11,000 households are now connected with the pipeline network and gas supply at these homes will begin soon after the connection paper work is completed.

PNG in the city is being supplied under the Patna City Gas Distribution Scheme, which was launched by PM Narendra Modi on February 2019 from Begusarai. It targets to connect all households in Patna at an estimated cost of Rs 2,500 crore.

Rajneesh Goel, deputy general manager (DGM) of GAIL, Patna region, said on Thursday that currently pipoed gas is being supplied to several areas across the city, including at BIT colony, AIIMS colony, building construction department quarters in Rajbanshi Nagar, IGIMS colony and some parts of Jagdeopath.

“The gas pipelines have been laid at more locations covering 11,000 households, including DRM colony in Khagaul, electricity board quarters, Ved Nagar, Vikas Nagar, RPS colony, some parts of Rukkanpura and Gola Road. The supply of PNG will begin in these households by next week as registration work is in progress,” Goel said.

He added: “The target to connect all household in the city with PNG supply will be achieved by 2023. To achieve this target, we have to lay 1,000km pipelines in the city.”

GAIL is now in the process of laying pipelines on Bailey road and neighbouring areas on the stretch between Saguna Mor and Income-Tax roundabout.

To get PNG connection, the customers need to pay Rs 354 for registration and a refundable security deposit of Rs 6,000. PNG is priced at around Rs 23 per kg, which comes to around Rs 400 per month. The bill per month is calculated according to consumption.

Dr Ajit Kumar, who lives in AIIMS colony, said his wife has been using PNG for some months now. “It is cheaper than the LPG cylinder and lasts longer than the LPG cooking gas,” he added.

Trisha Kumar, registrar at BIT-Mesra Patna and a resident of BIT Colony said, “It is the first area in city which got PNG connection. I’m satisfied with the facility.”

The supply network being laid in Bihar is part of the Jagdishpur-Haldia gas pipeline project of the Centre under the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga Yojana. The main pipeline is connected with the injection point at Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh.

Representative image

PATNA: Auto-rickshaw drivers in the city have been badly hit by the shortage of CNG (compressed natural gas) with the filling stations witnessing long queues throughout the day. Dearth of filing stations in Patna district is also hampering the transition from fossil fuel to CNG.

Patna currently has just three CNG stations and all of them are on the outskirts of the city. Nearly, 2,670 vehicles run on CNG in Patna, including 70 cars.

Around 100 petrol-run autos that had converted to CNG are now forced to use petrol due to the CNG shortage. Rakesh Kumar, who plies his auto between Gandhi Maidan and Saguna Mor, complained of long queues at the Rukanpura filing station.

“The queues are so long that it takes more than seven hours to refill,” said Kumar, adding, “The state government should do something. Since I got the CNG kit fitted my earning has been reduced by 25%.”

Another auto-rickshaw driver, Kuldip Singh said he converted his auto back to petrol. “I started using petrol because my earning has been reduced to Rs 10,500 per month from Rs 18,000. I was not able to save anything,” Singh said.

Bihar State Auto-Chalak Sangh general secretary, Raj Kumar Jha said around 80 auto drivers have reconverted their vehicle to petrol due to the daily ruckus at the CNG stations in Patna.

“How can the state government expect the auto-drivers to convert the vehicles into CNG by January-end, 2021 when they are not able fulfil the demands,” he asked.

GAIL officials in Patna region are looking for private parties to collaborate with to set up more CNG stations. “It is difficult to get land for CNG stations in city. However, five more stations will come up at Saguna Mor, Naubatpur, Digha, Bailey road near RPS Mor and Station road before December 2020,” an official said.

MUZAFFARPUR: The beneficiaries of Lohia Swachch Abhiyan scheme in Aurai block on Wednesday adopted a peculiar way to protest against the officials for their “callous” attitude in making payments to them for construction of toilets.

Over 200 men, women and children reached the block office with ‘lota (a globular water container)’ in their hands as part of the protest.

The ‘lota march’, organised under the banner of Jan Sangharsh Morch (JSM), was led by a social worker Akhilesh Yadav. Yadav had earlier announced to launch a massive protest march on the occasion of ‘Makar Sankranti’ if payment is not made to the beneficiaries of the scheme by January 10.

“I chose this day as it is a day for making us ‘swachch (clean)’. The day marks the first day of the Sun’s transit into Makara (Capricorn). A sum of Rs 12,000 was to be given as incentive after construction of toilets in the houses of the selected beneficiaries. We met block development officer, circle officer and sub-divisional officer (east) several times, but in vain. Hence, we decided to hold a ‘lota march’ to draw the attention of the officials concerned,” Yadav said.

Aurai BDO Vinod Kumar Prasad said all required processes for making payments under the scheme were underway. “There were some technical glitches due to which we were unable to process the payments. The glitches have been rectified and the payments will be made by the end of February,” he said.

Vijayawada: Continuing the increasing trend, there has been a substantial spike of 8.7% in the total number of suicides during 2018, compared to 2017, in Vijayawada, according to the latest Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India (ADSI) 2018 report released by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). Out of these, 73% of the suicides were by men (211) while the rest were by women (75).

Vijayawada accounts for 5% of all the suicides in Andhra Pradesh and ranks 24th in a list of 53 major cities across India. While the city may account for only 5% of all the suicides in the entire state, the suicide rate (incidence of suicides in the city)—19.2%—is higher than the state average of 10.2%.

Of the 286 suicides reported in the city, at 53%, the most common reason behind the extreme step was family problems. Following that were bankruptcy and illness, which accounted for 11% each, love failure came next at 5%, then came extramarital affairs at 4%. The reasons for the remaining 8% of suicides were unknown.

At 2%, the total number of student suicides saw a decrease as compared to 11% in 2017. The top three means adopted by victims to end their lives were hanging, drowning, and consuming poison.

While the total number of suicides which cites unemployment as a reason were a mere 1% in the city, it is pertinent to note that 9.6% of people who took the extreme step happened to be unemployed.

The number of self-employed persons (vendors, tradesmen and other business) who ended their lives stood at 9.8%. Similarly, while failure in examination might have only been a fraction of the overall suicides, 7.6% of the suicides in the city were by students. Of all those who ended their lives, the percentage of professionals and salaried were 8.9% while the percentage of students who killed themselves was 7.6%.

The ADSI report noted that 17.1% of the people who killed themselves were housewives.

On the other hand, Visakhapatnam which happens to be a bigger city in terms of population and geography than Vijayawada, saw a massive 33% increase in suicides compared to 2017. However, at 290 suicides, they remain variant with Vijayawada by only one percent.

Vadodara: The detection of fake marksheets by the M S University (MSU) in 2019 during regular verifications sought by various organisations has sparked a major controversry with a senate member demanding that the varsity file offences in this regard.

The university gets a series of requests by employers as well as education institutes both in the country and abroad for verification of marksheets submitted by those who have passed out from the MSU. After examining the documents and checking records, the university gives its opinion regarding the authenticity of the document.

In 2019, the university had received 625 such requests from employers and education institutes. It had come to light that 20 marksheets submitted by former students of the university were fake.

While the detection of fake marksheets was a part of regular procedures, it sparked a row with senate member and Congress spokespersons Narendra Ravat demanding that the university should register offences regarding the fakes it had detected. He claimed that the data that was shared by the university recently was only of one year and there may be many more such cases.

MSU vice chancellor Parimal Vyas said that the university had introduced a series of security measures in its marksheets to ensure that any counterfeiting could be detected. “We inform the police regarding this. We will examine the possibility of registering offences and take necessary action,” he said. Vyas said that it was not necessary that the duplicate marksheets were made locally. “This can be done by any person at any place. We are improving our mechanisms to ensure that making fake marksheets is not easy,” he said.

Chennai: Proximity to public transport, which was not a top priority in earlier years, is now driving consumer rental decisions, shows a study by real estate search portal NoBroker.com. While preference for proximity to public transport grew from 46% in 2018 to 59% in 2019, the share of consumers considering factors like water and safety stood flat year-on-year. The survey covered all major metro cities — Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Pune and Hyderabad, — with a sample size of 14,526 respondents.

“Although cost of rent, availability of car park space continues to be major concerns proximity to public transport and water supply have seen higher requests in the last year,” Saurabh Garg, co-founder and chief business officer of NoBroker.com said. The survey conducted to study the property-search patterns has found traffic woes taking a toll on consumers and change of workplace becoming increasingly a relevant factor as more people choose to stay close to work.

Amritha Vijaybaskar (28), a Bengaluru-based HR professional shared her experience moving from three houses in a year before settling for a home with access to public transport.

“There was no second thought in admitting how public transport is more than a necessity, especially in a city where most street corners witness traffic jams,” Vijaybaskar said.

The ‘no-compromise’ moto on renting houses only with close proximity to metro station or bus station is on an increasing trend among two or four-wheelers owners too. “Though we have a car only one of us could use it at a time, while the other uses public transport. Since, our offices are at two opposite directions, we compromised on a house midway to save time. However, we had to pay 15% higher rent,” Sukanya Adithya, (35) a Medavakkam resident in Chennai, who takes the public bus from Medavakkam to Adyar. ANAROCK Property Consultants’s vice chairman Santhosh Kumar agrees though not applicable for self-employed people, majority of Indian tenants still find public transport essential. “It goes without saying that people who rent homes are usually professionally active and need to get to and from work with reasonable ease. Depending on the city in question, public transport may be the most feasible way of commuting and the availability of accessible bus and train connectivity cannot be over-emphasised,” he said.

50,['17/01/2020'],Sebi allows trading in options on commodities,"This story is from January 17, 2020

(File photo)

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi on Thursday allowed exchanges to start trading in options on goods, which could potentially bring down the risk of trading in commodities like gold, silver, rubber, chana and garments. This will also allow traders to take delivery of goods on which they buy options, market experts said.

Till now, futures on commodities were allowed and options trading was limited to contracts on those futures, while direct trading in options contracts on commodities were not allowed. For example, MCX had launched options on gold futures. The current regulation will allow exchanges to launch options contracts on gold.

In a detailed circular, Sebi on Thursday specified the contract sizes for these options, how the settlement will take place, when delivery could be made, at what prices there contracts could be exercised, etc.

According to market experts, Sebi’s decision was a right step at further strengthening the commodity derivatives market. “The provisions shall pave the way for launching options contract in commodities based on underlying spot market price and settlement through compulsory delivery,” said Sanjit Prasad , MD & CEO, ICEX . “These contracts will reduce the risk for the hedgers. Options in agriculture commodities can prove to be an important tool to replace minimum support price intervention scheme of the government,” Prasad said.

51,['17/01/2020'],Amfi seeks debt funds with tax sops for retail investors,"This story is from January 17, 2020

(File photo)

MUMBAI: You could soon have another option to save taxes by investing in debt schemes of mutual fund houses, if a proposal by Amfi, the industry’s trade body, is accepted by the government. Planned on the lines of Equity Linked Savings Scheme ( ELSS ), one of the most popular tax-saving instruments for Indian investors, Amfi has proposed to allow the introduction of ‘Debt Linked Savings Scheme’, or DLSS , by the government in its Budget proposal.

In addition to offering retail investors another tax-saving option, the proposed DLSS could also “help channelise long-term savings of retail investors into the corporate bond market and help in deepening the Indian bond market,” the Amfi said in its Budget proposal to the finance minister.

“While the RBI and Sebi have taken the welcome steps in developing a vibrant corporate bond market in recent times, it is imperative that other stakeholders complement these efforts, considering the fact that with banks undertaking the much needed balance sheet repairs and a section of the corporate sector coming to terms with deleveraging, the onus of providing credit falls on the other players,” Amfi said.According to latest Amfi data, ELSS — with total assets under management (AUM) nearing Rs 1 lakh crore — was the third grossing scheme type among equity funds, behind large-cap (Rs 1.55 lakh crore) and multi-cap (Rs 1.53 lakh crore).

ELSS as a fund group contributes about 15% to the total equity fund AUM. Since these funds come with a three-year lock-in for enjoying tax exemptions, the fund managers also get a longer investment horizon than other open-ended funds.

In its 17-point agenda, Amfi also proposed abolition of dividend distribution tax ( DDT ) for equity mutual funds. It also proposed similar tax treatment for NPS, EPFO, insurance companies and some other select group of companies “who invest on behalf of their investors/contributors/ policyholders in mutual fund schemes or infrastructure debt funds of mutual funds”.

52,['17/01/2020'],Bihar: Vaishali crowd greets ‘lauh purush’ with pro-CAA chants,"This story is from January 17, 2020

A view of crowd of BJP national president and Union Home Minister Amit Shah's rally in support of CAA at Vaish... Read More

VAISHALI GARH: All roads leading to Khanauna village, adjacent to the venue of Union home minister Amit Shah ’s ‘Jan Jagran Sabha (public awareness meeting)’ about CAA, were dotted with saffron flags and mood of the local residents was upbeat. Reason: It was the first occasion for them to have a glimpse of the BJP stalwarts, particularly Shah.

“Shah has emerged as ‘lauh purush’ (a man with iron will) of the present era. His role in abrogation of Article 370 and 35A, which earlier gave special status to Jammu & Kashmir, has made me a great fan of him,” said 70-year Janardhan Singh, who was being helped by his 18-year-old grandson Sonu Kumar to reach the venue of the meeting.

People were seen jostling with each other to reach the venue as early as possible. “I have come from Dhankaul village under Patepur assembly segment of Ujiarpur Lok Sabha constituency in Vaishali district. Though I am not a BJP ‘bhakt’ (as saffron party supporters are referred to), I have come to listen to the Union minister to know the fact of the matter,” said Ganesh Kumar (55), who ekes out livelihood by giving door-to-door tuition to students.

The motley crowd mostly comprised of youths, who responded by waiving their hands in the air at every shout of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’. The crowd became restless to listen to the Union minister as soon as the helicopter started hovering over their head on the Khanaura Pokhar ground. Slogans like ‘Amit Shah zindabad’, ‘Amit Shah amar rahe’ and ‘Bharat mata ki jai’ rent the air.

Though women were sitting calm and composed in chairs, they too joined the youths when Shah asked the audience to take out their cellphones and dial a particular number to express their solidarity with central government on the CAA. Everybody in the crowd showed their cellphone sets to Shah and started dialling the number. “Lekin mera phone to lag nahi raha hai (I am not getting connected),” rued Pawan Singh (35), a resident of Vaishali Garh .

A woman police constable, who was on duty near the barricade, replied, “Jammar laga hua hai. Phone kaise lagega (Jammers have been installed. How will the cellphones work?). The same complaint came from others in the crowd as well. Movable jammers were installed at the venue as a precautionary measure. Shah’s threat perception is very high.

Mamta Devi (48), a resident of Ufraul village, was more candid in her conversation. “Mujhe CAA ke bare mein bahut malum nahi hai. Lekin netaon ki baat sunkar to aisa lagta hai ki kanoon thik hi hai (Though I don’t have much knowledge about the CAA, the netas’ statements suggest that the law is okay),” she said, adding that several BJP functionaries led by Union minister Nityanand Rai and state party chief Sanjay Jaiswal had earlier visited her native village.

Though the villages around Kharauna Pokhar, the venue of the meeting, have a sizeable chunk of Muslim voters, their presence was negligible. “Battlelines have already been drawn. Abki baar vidhan sabha chunav mein pata chal jayega ki janta kiske saath hai,” said 65-year-Sarfaraz Alam, a tailor.

A child at the protest venue at Sabzibagh area in Patna

PATNA: The Sabzibagh locality of the city has virtually turned into national capital’s Shaheen Bagh with people from all age groups sitting on an indefinite dharna since January 12 to protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR). With tricolours in their hands, people can be seen raising slogans like ‘hum le ke rahenge azadi’ and ‘kagaj nahi dikhayenge’.

The protesters said their lifestyle changed since Sunday when the agitation was launched. While homemakers finish their daily chores in haste, businessmen shut their shops early to join the protest. It is mainly from the evening that the protest starts gathering momentum, though some people stay there round the clock.

Ahmad Yasmeen, a homemaker from Langar Toli locality, said, “I finish my household chores early and join the protest in the evening and stay there till 11pm.”

Ninety-year old Soghra Khatoon, who also joined the protest braving biting cold, said, “I decided to stay in India after the partition and no one can force me to leave the country,” said this nonagenarian.

Co-coordinating from the stage, 25-year-old Saujanya Upadyaya said they start the day with national anthem, which is followed by reading of the Constitution. “We talk about our freedom fighters and the importance of the Constitution. We also make it sure that the stage is not used by any politician. It is people’s protest and we all are together in our fight against the present government at the Centre,” he said.

Daniyal Alam, a final-year law student from Dehradun, who came to Patna recently on a vacation, has also joined the protest. “This is not about any community. We are the followers of Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh,” he said.

Locals also ensure that the commuters are not disturbed. “Our aim is not only to pull the crowd, but also ensure that others do not face problem. A group of young boys has been deputed at the site to manage traffic,” said Prince, a local businessman.

Former Patna mayor Afzal Imam is also a daily visitor to the protest site. “The government is formed for people, but the present government is only working to divide the country on the basis of religion while ignoring issues like unemployment and inflation. After CAA, they have come up with NPR, in which even date of birth of parents will be asked. How many people remember these figures?” Imam asked. He also hit out at CM Nitish Kumar for “neglecting” the poor who voted for his party. “Nitish has notified NPR in the state and we all know that only poor and middle class people will be harassed by this,” Imam added.

54,['17/01/2020'],Lekhpals and junior officers behind the delay in land acquisition?,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Land acquisition for highways and Ring road projects has exposed the laxity of lekhpals and junior-rank office... Read More

VARANASI: Fast-tracking the process to tackle problems that delayed land acquisition for highways and Ring road projects has exposed the laxity of lekhpals and junior-rank officers.

While necessary forms for collection of compensation amount were not distributed among land owners by lekhpals, SDM Sadar Ballia, despite repeated reminders, did not give the details of land acquired to senior officials.

Sample this. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma issued a show-cause notice to lekhpal Lohrapur for creating hurdles in compensation distribution process among farmers.

Also, a letter requesting the suspension of SDM Sadar of Ballia district was forwarded to state government for not providing records of owners of land acquired for Varanasi-Ghazipur National Highway-29 that led to delay in land acquisition process. List of other lekhpals, who have not completed the formalities of land acquisition, was also sought by the DM.

“A showcause notice has been issued to lekhpal Lohrapur for delay in compensation distribution process. Also, a letter recommending SDM Sadar Ballia’s suspension has been sent to state government,” said DM Kaushal Raj Sharma.

The DM, who had set a deadline of first week of February to wind up the process of land acquisition process for all highway and infrastructure related projects last week, conducted the first hearing on Tuesday evening to clear hurdles of nine highway projects and ring road in presence of NHAI officials, ADM (administration) and special land acquisition officer (SLO).

During the hearing it surfaced that in ring road phase-I project of NHAI, Rs 297 crore had to be distributed among land owners, which have been acquired for it. However, after distribution of Rs 284 crore remaining, Rs 13 crore were left unused in the SLO’s account as the Lohrapur lekhpal did not distribute the necessary forms to farmers and land owners of Ahmadpur, Danupur and Singhpur villages to begin collection of compensation.

The SDM Sadar of Ballia district came on the radar of officials for not providing the details of land records of villages including Kaithi despite repeated reminders from SLO office. This delayed the process of distributing compensation amount among owners of land acquired for Varanasi-Ghazipur NH-29 for past several months.

Notably, the SDM Sadar Ballia also holds the charge of additional revenue officer (ARO) and looks after the record operation department of Varanasi region for the settlement of land along river banks.

The distribution of compensation among the owners of land acquired for constructing toll plaza on NH-2 has also not been distributed so far.

The DM was also shocked to see that despite the directives issued to SDMs concerned last week for solving the issues hurdling the process of taking possession on acquired land at Kachnar, Thathra and Bihda villages were not solved so far.

The officials were also asked to coordinate with NHAI officials for holding camps to complete the process of compensation distribution and solving all other issues.

55,['17/01/2020'],Biometric devices go kaput in MU colleges,"This story is from January 17, 2020

GAYA: The Magadh University administration has received several complaints regarding malfunctioning of biometric machines to record daily arrival and departure timing of the nearly 1,700 employees of the university’s central office, postgraduate departments, 19 constituent colleges and one government-funded minority college spread over the five districts of Magadh division.

Though the machines were installed more than a year ago, the present vice-chancellor (VC), Rajendra Prasad, has taken the initiative to monitor the functioning of the biometric machines and link it with the salary payment system of teachers and non-teaching staff.

As per the complaints, besides developing frequent snags, the machines fail to identify and register attendance on the basis of finger impressions of several employees. In many cases, the employees have to make repeated attempts and sometimes the machine positively responds and sometimes it does not respond and ‘timed out’ messages are flashed on the screen.

Conceding receipt of complaints about malfunctioning of the biometric attendance machines, the VC said that a committee has been constituted to conduct a performance audit of the biometric attendance machines.

“The committee will visit all the colleges and university departments, where such machines have been installed. The committee has already visited more than six colleges and follow up action will be taken once the committee submits its report. The private company, which was awarded the contract for the installation of biometric attendance machines and its subsequent maintenance, has been asked to depute its representative to accompany the inquiry committee members during their visit to the colleges and departments where the machines are installed,” said the VC.

He added, “Employees whose attendance is not recorded in the machine have been asked to manually register their arrival or departure in the attendance register.”

PATNA: Former Union minister and RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha on Thursday made an appeal to all non-NDA parties in the state to take part in a human chain to be organised by his party on January 24 on the twin issues of unemployment and education. The RLSP has sent letters in this regard to all major anti-NDA parties, including Congress, RJD and Left allies.

Incidentally, the state government will organise a statewide human chain on January 19 to promote Jal Jeevan Hariyali scheme, liquor prohibition and its anti-dowry and anti-child marriage campaigns.

“Education and unemployment are the main issues in Bihar. The education system has completely deteriorated in the last 15 years since Nitish Kumar came to power. People have been forced to migrate to other states for education and employment,” Kushwaha said. The slogan of RLSP’s human chain is ‘Hame chahiye shiksha aur rozgar, isiliye manav katar’.

Kushwaha said January 24 was chosen for the event to mark socialist icon Karpoori Thakur’s birth anniversary. “We will organise various programmes like cycle rally, foot march and ‘prabhat pheri’ on January 21 to garner support for the human chain, which will be formed outside government schools,” Kushwaha said.

He claimed that the Congress will emerge as the strongest of all political parties in the state.

Kapoor, who was on a one-day visit to Bihar to interact with the members of Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee and discuss party’s strategy for the upcoming assembly elections, said the Congress functionaries and workers will work tirelessly to rejuvenate the party in the state.

Asked about RJD, which is presenting itself as big brother in Mahagathbandhan and strongest of all the allies in Bihar, Kapoor said, “All parties are strong but Congress will emerge as the strongest of them all.”

Kapoor refrained from naming RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as the alliance’s chief ministerial candidate. “These things are decided by the Congress’s high command,” he said.

Kapoor also hit out at CM Nitish Kumar for planning to organise a human chain to promote the government’s Jal Jeevan Hariyali scheme on January 19, saying the latter was “fooling” common people. “Was Nitish unaware of environmental issues when he came to power in the state 15 years ago?,” he asked.

Surat: Congress leaders have opposed Surat Municipal Corporation’s (SMC) drive to contact people for positive feedback on cleanliness under ‘Swachh Sarvekshan’ campaign.

Congress councillors have written to municipal commissioner stating that health officials have been moving around in the city and contacting people for their feedback on cleanliness. The health officials are asking residents to submit positive feedback and also taking their mobile numbers.

Aslam Cyclewala, Congress councillor, said, “We are not opposed to feedback, but the way the health officials are visiting localities and asking residents for positive feedback is quite disturbing. If people are happy with cleanliness in the city, they are going to vote under Swachh Sarvekshan.”

“In many places, health officials are facing ire of the residents, particularly in slum areas. It is because the residents are unhappy with cleanliness and lack of water, roads, drainage etc in their areas,” he added.

Last year, the Diamond City was pushed to 14th spot from 4th spot in national ranking and in the last two quarters of this year, it is placed at the 20th place.

Sources said health department of SMC has started a rigorous exercise of door-to-door campaign where officials have been instructed to interact with people. The health officials have been moving around at railway station, bus depots, vegetable markets, processing plants, public and community toilets, commercial and residential localities.

Dr Ashish Naik, deputy municipal commissioner (health and hospital), told TOI, “Till now, we have been successful in getting 1.61 lakh feedback. All this is due to door-to-door campaign launched in the city since January 4. We are doing this activity under information, education and communication (IEC) programme. There is no opposition from residents regarding feedback under Swachh Sarvekshan campaign. Actually, we are also visiting colleges and schools to get feedback of the students.”

Surat: City-based NGOs , working for the rescue and rehabilitation of the injured animals and birds have urged the residents in the Diamond City to properly dispose the sharp-edged kite strings (manja) left, especially from the trees , to prevent injuries to birds and other animals.

Voluntary organisations stated that the number of birds injured by the manja decreased drastically in 2020 compared to 2019 during the two days of kite flying festival on January 14 and 15. However, they are still getting an average of 150 calls of the bird rescue, majority of them are entangled in the strings on the trees and on the terraces.

Darshan Desai of Prayas NGO told TOI, “We have received 93 calls for bird rescue from different parts of the city on Thursday. Though the festival is over, still we are getting calls for rescue. The manja left on the terrace and those hanging from the trees and other places is hurting the birds.”

“We have been urging people to dispose the manja from the terraces, plants and trees to save the lives of the innocent birds. Number of calls are for pigeon rescue,” he added.

According to Desai, Prayas alone received 303 calls during two days of the festival, out of which there were 14 casualties. About 41 birds flew away after they were given primary treatment by the volunteers.

Snehal Patel of Nature Club Surat, an NGO working for the rescue of birds and animals said, “This year’s Uttrayan was comparatively safer for the birds, but we fear that the killer manja discarded on the roads, terraces and trees are not good for the birds. Our volunteers have been telling the people calling on our helpline to dispose the manja from their locality to save the birds.”

According to Patel, the rescue calls have actually increased after two days of the festival on Thursday. At present, the centre is receiving about 100 calls of bird rescue. Majority of the cases are critical as the birds are badly entangled in the manja.

Lucknow: There is no evidence to show the involvement of activist and lawyer Mohammad Shoaib in the violence that erupted during a protest against the citizenship law in Lucknow on December 19, said the district court, granting bail to him.

Shoaib was granted bail on Wednesday, 27 days after he was arrested but the court order was released only on Thursday. Shoaib is likely to come out of jail on Friday. According to the order, the prosecution failed to produce evidence to show Shoaib’s involvement in violence during the protest.

Additional district judge SS Pandey granted bail to Shoaib (76), considering that he was not named in the first FIR filed by police on the night of December 19 for the violence. Shoaib was only accused of conspiracy and the prosecution had admitted it had not come across any evidence proving Shoaib’s involvement in arson, the order said.

The court also took into account that fact that co-accused in the case activist SR Darapuri had already been granted bail. Besides, according to the police case diary, injuries to cops including SP (east) Suresh Chandra Rawat were not grievous, it said. Shoaib’s counsel in defence JS Siddiqui said that the administration had barred Shoaib from leaving his house since 6.30pm on December 18. The next day, after the violence, cops had asked him to accompany them around 11.45pm as “the circle officer wanted to meet him”. However, police had shown his arrest from Clarks Awadh trisection around 8.45pm on December 19.

On December 20, Shoaib’s family filed a habeas corpus petition in the high court to seek the reason for his detention. It was then revealed that Shoaib was arrested for involvement in a violent protest against CAA at Parivartan Chowk. The counsel also argued that it was Shoaib’s fundamental right to peacefully protest against government policies he disagreed with. The government advocate, however, said Shoaib was among the prime accused in conspiring the arson on December 19. He said Shoaib had instigated people to participate in the violence and being an advocate, had used help of his wife to protect himself from arrest. Bail was granted on furnishing two sureties of Rs 50,000 each along with a personal bond.

Mumbai: Moody’s has placed Yes Bank ’s ratings under review with a remark that further direction was uncertain. At the same time, the ratings agency has downgraded the bank’s baseline credit assessment to Caa2 from B3. The placing of Yes Bank’s deposit rating of B2 under review reflects Moody’s expectation that the lender’s standalone viability is getting increasingly challenged by its slowness in raising new capital.

The ratings agency said that the potential credit risk to the bank’s creditors is uncertain because there are several diverse scenarios that could affect it in either positive or negative directions. Yes Bank is in discussions with a number of investors to raise new equity capital, which would be credit-positive if executed successfully. If the bank successfully recapitalises, repairs and cleans its balance sheet, its ratings could stabilise or be upgraded. According to Moody’s, if a private sector solution is unsuccessful, and a regulatory led resolution is implemented, Moody’s expects that Indian authorities will strive to maintain systemic stability and avoid losses to depositors and senior creditors. Any concrete measures from Indian authorities to resolve the bank without losses to the depositors and senior creditors could also lead to a stabilisation or an upward movement in the bank’s ratings.

“Because the viability of the bank absent a large capital injection is in question, Moody’s has downgraded the bank’s standalone credit profile or its BCA to Caa2 from B3,” said Moody’s vice-president and senior credit officer Alka Anbarasu.

A scenario where neither a private sector recapitalisation nor balance sheet repair are forthcoming would be credit-negative, and could lead to a downward movement of the bank’s ratings.

Surat: Railway employees associated with Western Railway Mazdoor Sangh’s (WRMS) Surat branch will hold a protest at Surat railway station against privatized high-speed Tejas Express that will run between Mumbai and Ahmedabad on Friday.

Railway staff associated with WRMS stated that the protest was against privatization of railway services by the government. Tejas Express is being run by private operators through Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC).

Sources said the privatized Tejas Express train will start operations between Mumbai-Ahmedabad from January 19. The inaugural run of the train is scheduled on January 17 and that it will reach Surat station from Ahmedabad at about 12.40pm.

AK Verma, vice-chairman of Surat WRMS, said, “We are against privatization of trains and other railway services. Tejas Express train is being operated by private operators and they will exploit travelling public and earn huge profits without rendering good services.”

Verma added, “National Federation of Indian Railwaymen (NFIR) has already submitted a memorandum to central government against privatization of mail and express trains in the country earlier. Our demand is cancel this decision and allow railways to operate Tejas Express.”

Health minister Mangal Pandey inaugurates an air ambulance counter at Patna airport on Thursday

PATNA: A round the clock air ambulance counter, joint initiative of two private firms, was inaugurated by health minister Mangal Pandey at Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport (JPNI) here on Thursday.

The minister appreciated the joint initiative of the two private companies which provide air ambulance services across the country. “People can directly book air ambulance from this 24x7 counter at Patna airport now to shift patients to hospitals in other cities,” he said.

Patna airport director Bhupesh CH Negi, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) commandant Vishal Dubey, Airline Operators’ Committee chairman Rupesh Singh and airline executives attended the inaugural function.

An official of the private firm running the air ambulance service said permission had to be obtained from the state hangar earlier for parking the air ambulance for sending patients from Patna to other cities across the country. “Getting permission was a time-taking exercise. Now, people will not have to go through lengthy processes as all the formalities can be completed at the counter itself,” the official said.

Anshu Aman, managing director of the other private firm, said, “We have issued a toll free number – 9931075125 – for the convenience of people. One can avail the air ambulance service by paying Rs 4.80 lakh to 5 lakh. An ICU team, doctors, nurse and two attendants will accompany the patient.”

Aman added, “Ten to 12 patients avail the air ambulance service in Bihar on an average per month through recommendations from the doctors. Now, they can do it on their own.”

Officials of the two companies said they have planned to open similar air ambulance counter at Gaya airport next week. “One air ambulance aircraft will be stationed at Gaya airport,” they added.

Representative image

PATNA: City jeweller Mukesh Kumar Gupta, who was kidnapped from Saguna Mor under the Danapur police station area here on January 10, was killed while being taken to Motihari on the same day, police said on Thursday. Mukesh’s body had been disposed of by Motihari police as it remained unidentified even after 72 hours.

The matter came to light after Patna police arrested three criminals from the vicinity of St Karen’s High School on Gola Road here on Thursday. The arrested criminals were identified as Ramashish Kumar alias Ashish Yadav, Aman Kumar and Rajesh Kumar.

Mukesh’s elder brother Rakesh Kumar Gupta had lodged an FIR with Danapur police station on January 11 in connection with the incident. Mukesh had owned a jewellery shop on Kharanja Road at Danapur.

According to police, Mukesh had left for Saguna Mor from his shop after receiving a call on January 10. Later, a man reached the shop using Mukesh’s bike and left after taking jewellery worth of Rs 1.5 lakh from his elder brother Rakesh.

It was Mukesh who had called Rakesh, asking him to hand over the money to the man. After this, Mukesh’s cellphone remained switched off.

Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said Mukesh was taken to Motihari in a car by four criminals, including the three who were arrested on Thursday, and killed there.

“They had throttled Mukesh to death inside the car and dumped his body along a road the Chiraiyya police station area in Motihari. The body was recovered on the morning of January 11,” Sharma said, adding the fourth accused was evading arrest. “It was in the car of the fourth accused that Mukesh was killed,” the SSP added.

He said Mukesh’s body was disposed of in Motihari after 72 hours according to norms, but his family members identified it after seeing photographs. He said the prime accused, Ramashish, had kidnapped Mukesh with an intention to kill him.

“Ramashish had mortgaged jewellery worth around Rs 1.5 lakh to Mukesh. He wanted to take it back by paying money. However, Mukesh told Ramashish that the money he paid to him was not enough to reclaim entire jewellery,” the SSP said.

He added cellphone and sim card used to call Mukesh at Saguna Mor was seized from Ramashish possession. “Four more cellphones, three country-made pistols, including a semi-automatic one and 33 live cartridges were seized from the possession of the three arrested criminals,” the SSP said.

(Representative image)

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: A consortium of Tata Group and two financial investors will now buy 49% in GMR Airports , operator of the Delhi airport which is the largest in the country, instead of 44.4% as proposed earlier.

In March 2019, the consortium had planned to invest Rs 8,000 crore for a 44.4% stake in GMR Airports. But the deal ran into regulatory hurdles as rules do not allow a corporate owning an airline to have more than 10% in an airport.

Tata, which runs two airlines — Vistara and AirAsia India — in the country, was to own 19.7% in GMR Airports, while the two investors — GIC and SSG Capital — were to hold 14.8% and 9.9%. Competitors of Tata’s domestic airlines had opposed its foray into the airport sector on carrier ownership grounds.

The increased stake purchase of 49% will now see Tata’s share in GMR Airports coming down in a bid to comply with the rules. The two investors’ shares will go up in GMR Airports, which runs Asia’s sixth biggest airport at Delhi as well as the Hyderabad airport. GIC will become the largest shareholder in the consortium.

In October 2019, the country’s antitrust agency, Competition Commission of India, had approved Tata and the two investors’ deal to purchase up to 55.2% in GMR Airports, subject to Tata carrying out certain modifications. Tata intends to route its investment in GMR Airports through Tata Realty and Infrastructure, while GIC will do it via Singapore-based Valkyrie, and SSG Capital through Solis, also based in Singapore. Promoter GMR Infrastructure is divesting a large stake in the airports business as it wants to deleverage its balance sheet.

Ras Bihari Prasad Singh

PATNA: Patna University vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh said here on Thursday that even though population growth has so long been considered as a major constraint to India’s developmental process, the demographic dividend may well be utilised for ensuring exponential growth of knowledge resource.

Speaking as chief guest at the inaugural function of the 4th ‘Knowledge dissemination workshop’ organised by PU Population Research Centre (PRC) at Wheeler Senate House here, Singh said as many as 3.92 lakh babies are born in the world every day out of which 67,000 are born in India alone.

“While ways and means are already being found to check this population explosion, efforts should also be made to develop our country with such a vast population into a land of huge knowledge resource. Fortunately, 67% of the country’s population happens to be youth which can be properly trained to turn our problems into opportunities,” he said.

The directors of all the PRCs, except Jammu and Kashmir, are attending the two-day workshop. Altogether 26 research papers are to be presented at the workshop and a compendium containing 44 papers would be published.

Tejashwi Prasad Yadav

PATNA: RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Thursday launched his three-day ‘Pratirodh Sabha’ for Seemanchal region from Kishanganj with a veiled attack on the AIMIM president, Asaduddin Owaisi , who had addressed a rally here recently.

“Some parties are trying to create confusion in Bihar. Their leader (Owaisi) came here and said he is not afraid of Lalu Ji. He should have asked his ally, the Telangana CM, to stop NPR instead of preaching against NRC and NPR across the country,” Tejashwi said.

Tejashwi was addressing a rally at Marwari College in the Muslim-dominated Kishanganj district. His Pratirodh Sabha initiative is seen as a bid to stake claim on the Muslim votes of Seemanchal as the state gears up for polls later in the year.

The leader of opposition in Bihar also hit out at CM Nitish Kumar on NPR. He said Nitish is trying to fool people by claiming he will not allow implementation of the National Register of Citizen (NRC), but his government is allowing NPR here.

“I am challenging the CM that if he really doesn’t want to implement NRC then he should immediately call a special session of Bihar assembly and pass a resolution that NPR will not be implemented in the state…NPR is the first step for NRC,” Tejashwi said.

On NPR he said, “NPR is a census pro forma in which people will have to tell about the place of birth of their father. Division will start there itself. Hence, we completely oppose NPR and will not allow implementation of NPR as well as NRC in Bihar at any cost. We are ready to give our blood for preventing the division of the country. We will keep fighting.”

It was his first public meet in Seemanchal, which virtually kickstarted his party’s poll campaign from Kishanganj, which saw an AIMIM candidate win in the assembly bypoll held last year. Muslims form the traditional vote bank of RJD along with Yadavs in the state.

The Seemanchal region has a high Muslim population. According to the 2011 Census, Muslims constitute 42.95% in Araria, 38.46% in Purnea, 44.47% in Katihar and the highest in Kishanganj at 67.98%.

In a bid to woo the predominant Muslim population of the region, Tejashwi said “Whenever we talk about shortcomings of BJP-led NDA, they say they will send us to Pakistan. I would like to assert that Muslims of Seemanchal themselves can destroy Pakistan.”

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday said steps being taken by the state government to curb pollution, conserve water, promote greenery and protect the environment will greatly benefit the future generations. The CM said the government was taking several steps to control pollution by imposing relevant laws.

Addressing the ‘64th Conference of Chairmen and Member Secretaries of the Central and State Pollution Control Boards and Committees’ at Bihar Museum here, the CM said laws have been made for pollution control, but creating awareness among people about environment conservation is more important. “Awareness among people leads to more effective implementation of laws,” he said.

Speaking on air pollution in Bihar, Nitish said air pollution has become a major concern for Bihar where the number of vehicles has increased manifold with increase in purchasing power of people and good roads. He highlighted steps being taken towards environment conservation by the state government through its ambitious ‘Jal Jeevan Hariyali (JJH)’ mission.

“Around Rs 24,524 crore will be spent on JJH campaign by the state government in next three years and eight crore saplings will be planted across the state,” he said.

Nitish added global warming and climate change have already started affecting weather pattern. “Earlier, the average rainfall of the state was 1,200mm to 1,500mm. It came down to 1,027mm in last 30 years and further reduced to 901mm in last 13 years,” he said.

Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said environment protection was a top priority of the state government. “About 50% hospitals in Bihar are using bio-medical waste processing facilities upon strict directives from Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB),” he said.

Central Pollution Control Board chairman S P Singh Parihar, principal secretary of ministry of environment, forest and climate change (EFACC) C K Mishra, CM’s principal secretary Chanchal Kumar, principal secretary EFACC Dipak Kumar Singh, BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh and chairman of other state boards and committees were also present.

Surat: India will soon become an arms manufacturing hub and net exporter of defence equipment because of active participation of private sector now, defence minister Rajnath Singh said in Hazira on Thursday.

He flagged off the 51st K9 VAJRA-T gun from L&T’s armoured system complex (ASC) in the presence of group chairman AM Naik. L&T has till now delivered 51 K9 VAJRA-T guns of the total 100 to Indian Army.

Addressing the gathering at the ASC, Rajnath said, ““I have been told that more than 75 per cent of K9 VAJRA-T gun has been manufactured in India. Over 5,000 people have got direct employment and 12,500 indirect employment through this complex. It is a matter of great pride for us. This is first time after Independence that private sector is giving a new dimension to manufacturing of defence equipment in the country. Strategic partnership (SP) model, which has been introduced in defence production policy, will enable private sector to manufacture fighter aircraft, helicopters, submarines and armoured vehicles and emerge as global giants.”

“In the past, defence industry could not perform to its potential as the private sector did not receive the support. Thus, our dependence on import of arms for our defence forces increased. We are prepared to make policy changes to provide a better platform to both public and private sectors to work together and contribute in nation building,” the defence minister said, commending L&T for ensuring its participation under the SP model..

He said the government was determined to make India a defence manufacturing hub under ‘Make in India’ initiative. The $26 billion defence industry will provide employment to over three million people by 2025, the defence minister added. The government is setting up defence corridors in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for promoting manufacturing of defence equipment in the country.

“The government has taken various initiatives to increase manufacturing of defence equipment in India. We have simplified industry licensing process, increased foreign direct investment (FDI) cap, taken steps to promote defence exports, streamlined defence offsets policy, establishing defence investor cell, providing government-owned trial and testing facility to private sector and launching schemes for startups and SMEs to promote innovation,” Rajnath said.

The defence minister after he visited the L&T’s ASC said it was a strong example of ‘naye bharat ki nayi soch’.

The guns are equipped with India specific modifications

L&T began manufacturing the K9 Vajra-T 155mm/52 calibre tracked, self propelled Howitzer gun after winning the largest contract ever awarded to an Indian private company by the ministry of defence through global competitive bidding. The contract involves delivery of 100 guns in 42 months with an associated engineering support package (ESP) covering spares, documentation and training etc. The 51 guns delivered are equipped with India specific modifications such as auxiliary power pack, air-conditioning and firefighting systems etc for desert conditions.

Surat: A textile weaver was cheated by a broker , owner of a textile shop and a mill owner to the tune of Rs30 lakh worth fabrics. Salabatpura police on Thursday registered a complaint in this connection and launched a manhunt to nab the accused who are on the run.

Vipul Shah, 40, owner of a powerloom unit, had supplied grey cloth worth Rs30 lakh to Mahesh Sarang, proprietor of Ganesh Fabrics; Pinkesh Patel, proprietor of Kailash Silk Mills; and Bhupendra Joshi two years ago. The trio had issued cheques for part payment against delivery of fabrics, but all the cheques bounced when presented in bank.

Shah said in his complaint that he had contacted the trio on their mobile phones, but they stopped receiving his calls. A few days ago, the complainant met Bhupendra Joshi, broker, who threatened him and asked him not to demand money again.

SG Chauhan, police sub-inspector, told TOI, “We have registered the complaint against the trio under IPC sections 406, 420, 120(b), 504 and 506(2). One of the accused had threatened the complainant a few days ago. This prompted the complainant to approach us. A manhunt has been launched to arrest the accused.”

82,['17/01/2020'],"Co-lo case: Sebi clears 9 ex-NSE, current execs","This story is from January 17, 2020

Mumbai: Sebi has given a clean chit to nine people, including NSE ’s former MD Ravi Narain , in a case in which it was alleged that a host of the exchange’s executives had colluded to favour a handful of brokers. The two sides had allegedly teamed up to make illegal gains using the NSE’s optical fibre network that connected to its derivatives trading server.

Popularly called the NSE’s co-location or co-lo case, there were several allegations of wrongdoing against Narain and other ex-NSE executives — senior VP (operations) R Nandakumar, co-lo head Jagdish Joshi, and chief technology officers (CTOs) N Muralidharan & Ravi Apte. Several serving NSE executives named in the case have also been exonerated. These are chief operating officer (trading) Mayur Sindhwad, CTO (projects) Sankarson Banerjee, CTO (operations) G Shenoy, and VP (regulations) Suprabhat Lala .

The case relates to the allegations of wrongdoing between 2013 and 2015.

In its order, the markets regulator said that none of the nine executives was occupying a post of director and/or a key managerial position at NSE during the relevant period, which was between April and July, 2015. “The materials available on record also don’t indicate even remotely the role of any of the noticees as an employee of NSE in facilitating Sampark Infotainment to establish the (optical fibre) connectivity at NSE,” the regulator said in its order.

In this high-profile case, it was alleged that exchange executives had allowed a non-registered service provider Sampark Infotainment to lay optic fibre network connectivity between the exchange’s trading room and the servers of select brokers. This was done in such a way that these brokers enjoyed a faster speed of trading over all others.

In the exchange trading business, where there are very sophisticated computers that use complex algorithms to take advantage of price discrepancies within micro-seconds, such advantages could result in huge profits.

It was also alleged that these nine NSE executives did not act in a fair and equitable manner in their dealing with the brokers. A further allegation was that NSE had amended its rules in an opaque manner to allow Sampark Infotainment to provide network services from within its premises, despite the company not being registered with it. Sebi didn’t find any evidence in this matter too to proceed against these officials.

83,['17/01/2020'],‘Pay as you use’ motor cover sees test launch,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Mumbai: The insurance regulator has approved two proposals for usage-based motor insurance policies under its regulatory sandbox scheme.

The scheme allows insurance companies to come out with products that are not just innovative but radically different in the way business is done. However, the policies have to be launched as a pilot project and distributed in relatively small numbers in a controlled environment until they are proven.

Bajaj Allianz’s motor insurance policy allows customers to pay the premium depending on how many kilometres the car has travelled. Edelweiss General Insurance has got the nod for an app-based multi-vehicle, usage-based floater policy for motor own damage cover.

Bajaj Allianz has also launched a health insurance product with a co-pay feature (where the customer pays part of the bill) in partnership with fitness tracker GOQii. “I firmly believe that a healthy lifestyle, coupled with health insurance, increases the life expectancy of a person. Under the co-pay model, we are associating with GOQii wherein, based on the engagement level of the insured on the health platform offered by GOQii, the percentage of their co-pay will be decided,” said Bajaj Allianz MD & CEO Tapan Singhel . “Additionally, in India, the premium for a motor insurance policy for the own damage part is based on the age, make and model of the vehicle. ‘Pay as you consume’ model will help us change,” said Singhel. According to Edelweiss General Insurance, the IRDAI operational guidelines for the sandbox allow the pilot product launch only between February 1 and July 31 this year. “The emerging era of shared mobility makes it a very relevant product for vehicle owners today, where they can pay as per the usage of the vehicle and/or driving behaviour. Further, as the policy covers multiple vehicles in one, it saves you time and any hassle involved with buying multiple policies for multiple vehicles,” said Edelweiss General Insurance CEO and executive director Shanai Ghosh.

(File photo)

MUMBAI: HDFC Bank will carry out an upgrade of its credit card platform to provide new features that will give more power to customers in a phased manner. The upgrade will happen on January 18, between 1 am and 12 noon, leading to a limited outage in services. Though phone banking, net/mobile banking and interactive voice response systems will be unavailable for card customers, cards will continue to function for both online and offline purchases.

A spokesperson for the bank said it will be upgrading to VisionPlus V10, the latest in global banking architecture. “This migration is an industry-first in India and will offer a superior user experience for credit card customers. It will enable the bank to be completely future-ready and enhance customer experience by offering faster resolution of credit card disputes. From about a week to less than a day and instant card creation, even during browsing on an e-commerce site,” the spokesperson said.

The instant card generation will initially be available only for existing customers but is likely to be extended to non-customers later. The bank will speed up dispute resolution by making the process straight through. The new system will allow the users to file disputes by clicking photographs of charge slips and uploading them.

In future, there will be value-added service through partnerships, as the bank will be providing faster API (application programmed interface) integration, allowing more third-party service providers to plug in to offer their services to HDFC Bank customers.

Cardholders who are travelling overseas will be able to apply for an immediate increase in their credit limits through the bank’s app.

SURAT: In a major blow to BJP in Navsari, president of the Vejalpore Nagarpalika , Rajesh Modi along with 250 supporters resigned from the party’s membership on Thursday. The flood of resignations follows the party leadership’s failure to take disciplinary action against the vice-president of the nagarpalika who had slapped Modi during the general board meeting in December.

Unruly scenes were witnessed at the general board meeting of Vejalpore Nagarpalika on December 27 after the issue of the expansion of Navsari Nagarpalika’s limits came up for discussion.

After he was not allowed to speak, vice-president Santosh Pundhkar got irritated and slapped Rajesh Modi at the meeting.

Sources said that there are a total of 36 members in the Vejalpore Nagarpalika, of which 33 are from BJP and three from Congress. More than a year ago, Pundhkar also tried to bring about a no confidence motion against Modi by forming a rival group with 15 members of the nagarpalika.

However, as there was no discussion held on the no confidence motion against the president in any of the general board meetings held in the last one-and-a-half-years, Pundhkar and his supporters were extremely angry.

During the last general board meeting on December 27, verbal exchanges took place between Modi and Pundhkar over the expansion issue, where Pundhkar slapped Modi in front of the entire nagarpalika members.

Talking to TOI, Modi said, “Pundhkar had formed a group of 15 BJP members in the nagarpalika to remove me from the post and take the control. He wanted to do wrong things to earn money illegally, which I opposed many times. As none of his work was done in the nagarpalika, he took the opportunity to slap me during the general board meeting.”

Modi further said that he had given an ultimatum till January 14 to the party leadership to suspend Pundhkar and his group of members in the nagarpalika. However, after no action was taken, they decided enmass to tender resignation. “I am also prepared to resign as the president of Vejalpore nagarpalika,” he added.

When contacted, Navsari district BJP pesident, Naresh Patel said, “We had assured Modi of taking action against Pundhkar and other 15 members of nagarpalika. But he resigned from the party. I have received information from the party leadership that all the 15 members including Pundhkar will be suspended for their act before January 20.”

86,['17/01/2020'],"Despite nation-wide ban, plastic kites and Chinese manja have free run this Sankranti","This story is from January 17, 2020

HYDERABAD: Sankranti , turned out to be a messy affair with many areas in the city littered with remnants of plastic kites and Chinese manja this year. Ironically, there is a state-wide ban on single-use plastic and nation-wide ban on manufacture and sale of Chinese manja.

Environment Foundation of India’s Arun Krishnamurthy said, “Debris of plastic from kites and manja was found on city streets, drains and even tree tops. This is going to cause a considerable harm to the environment for years.”

“The single-use plastic ban needs to be enforced strictly. It is also proof that National Green Tribunal’s ban on Chinese manja is not being implemented properly,” environmental activist Prof K Purushotham Reddy said.

On Thursday, Meerpet police recorded the statement of 14-year-old Mandala Narsimha, who suffered burns when his kite came in contact with overhead electric lines.

“When the boy pulled the manja, sparks from the electric lines and fell on him. The dry grass on which he was standing also caught fire,” Meerpet SI B Krishna Reddy said.

Sai Anirudh, a resident of Habsiguda, said, “I had a near-death experience a day before Sankranti after a plastic kite came flying down and got stuck on my face while I was driving my two-wheeler. I couldn’t breathe or see anything until I realised what was happening and removed the plastic from my face.”

Taskforce police seized Chinese manja worth Rs 2.6 lakh from Shivlal Kite Shop in Himayathnagar, Gopal Singh Kites Shop in Domalguda on Tuesday night and apprehended the shop owners Birju Shivlal and Lalchita Kishan.

Telangana State Forest Department officials added that six mobile teams were formed to check sale and purchase of Chinese manja.

“Six mobile squads conducted searches on 250 shops and recovered 118 kg of synthetic manja,” a forest department release said.

Birds bear brunt of festivities

The forest department officials and volunteers of wildlife and environmental NGOs rescued 39 birds including pigeons, crows, eagles and black kites during Sankranti celebration. According to rescue volunteers, a few birds were found dead and several others were injured after getting caught in manja between January 13 and 16.

Soudharm Bhandari from Greater Hyderabad Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said eight birds died in past three days due to injuries from glass-coated manja. Forest department asked citizens to contact on helpline number (18004255364 & 040-23231440).

87,['17/01/2020'],"Free power, water in Delhi: AAP to give guarantee cards","This story is from January 17, 2020

Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: As free schemes take centre stage ahead of Delhi assembly polls , Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is planning to give guarantee cards to the people of the national capital. The cards will guarantee people 200 units of free electricity and 20,000 litres of free water per month for the next five years, apart from free bus ride for women and free pilgrimage scheme for senior citizens. The party is also mulling appointment of “mohalla marshals” in several areas to make them secure.

The guarantee cards will be delivered to the residents in all 70 assembly constituencies well before the assembly polls, which are scheduled to take place on February 8. AAP Rajya Sabha MP ND Gupta said that the guarantee cards and the party’s poll manifestos are likely to be distributed separately. We are planning to distribute guarantee cards before the manifestos, sources said.

Gupta said that the appointment of “mohalla marshals” may find a mention in the party’s manifesto. “These marshals would be deployed as security persons in various mohallas and would be paid by the government for their services.”

Free welfare schemes of the AAP government have found many supporters in Delhi. In a bid to capitalise on the love of people for the free schemes, Delhi Congress has also announced that if elected to power, the party will give monthly 600 units of electricity and 20,000 litres of water free.

AAP and BJP functionaries have been locking horns over the free welfare schemes of late. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and other leaders have repeatedly claimed that the saffron party would stop free services like electricity, water and bus rides for women, if it came to power in Delhi. AAP MP Sanjay Singh had on Wednesday got into a confrontation with BJP parliamentarian Gautam Gambhir on the issue. “BJP functionary Anil Jain had said that his party was against any kind of free services to people. Now, Gambhir has contradicted the claims made by Manoj Tiwari,” Singh said.

Hitting out at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Gambhir had said that he was not against free services for poor, but those who could afford them should pay nominal charges. Singh alleged that BJP leaders were continuously opposing the free welfare schemes of the AAP government.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari has, however, clarified that no existing subsidy started by the AAP government would be altered. On Thursday, he again slammed AAP leaders who have been claiming that BJP would stop the free welfare schemes if it came to power in Delhi.

“AAP leaders are habitual liars and always twist the facts to suit their interests. After coming to power, BJP will give five times the benefits given by the AAP government. Several central schemes that were stopped by the AAP government, would benefit people” Tiwari said.

Thiruvananthapuram: Former DGP T P Senkumar , who claimed to be an active SNDP union member after his retirement, has accused SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan of amassing illegal wealth worth Rs 1,600 crore and demanded a comprehensive probe against the members of Vellapally family.

Addressing reporters along with SNDP union leader Subhash Vasu, who raised similar allegations against Natesan, on Thursday, Senkumar alleged that Natesan has a hoard of wealth amounting to Rs 1,600 crore, ‘which he accumulated through unaccounted donations received against school and college admissions and appointment of teachers’.

The duo also demanded an administrator rule in SNDP Yogam for a three-month period and fresh elections after that. “Many people have told me about the bitter experiences they had due to Natesan’s leadership. There are schools and colleges which are managed by the SNDP Yogam and Sree Narayana Trust,” he said.

“We must know where this money went,” Senkumar said demanding probes by directorate of revenue intelligence, income tax department and enforcement directorate. Senkumar also accused Natesan of mismanagement of the micro financing project aimed to benefit Ezhava community and misappropriation of funds. “Majority of people converting to other religions are from Ezhava community. This is because of poverty. The micro financing initiative was supposed to give them loans at a low 4% interest rate. I hope the legal battle against the financial fraud will have a proper conclusion,” he said.

He also questioned the authenticity of internal elections of SNDP Yogam and alleged that Natesan was winning the elections through unfair means like bogus votes. Senkumar said Natesan and family should stay away from the Yogam administration for a while. “A reputed and reliable retired judge must take over the administration for three months, and a free and fair election should be conducted under the watchful eyes of the judge. We are ready to accept Natesan, if re-elected properly,” he added.

Amaravati: Upping the ante, farmers in the capital city area demanded that the state government should first make the experts committee reports public before seeking their opinion.

In response to the advice of the high-level committee comprising ministers and officials, to file their suggestions and objections with the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) commissioner, the LPS farmers sent mails to the CRDA office. Farmers said the minister’s appeal on the issue was amateurish. They raised strong objection to the government calling for their views without making its stance clear. “Everything is going on in closed-door meetings. The experts’ committee reports are not made open. High-level committee meeting notes are not circulated. How could they expect us to respond?,” asked farmers’ leader and advocate Mallela Seshagiri Rao.

The LPS farmers filed separate petitions to CRDA commissioner taking strong exception to the way it was handling a serious issue without consulting them. “We are the stakeholders of Amaravati, the capital city development project. How could the government take unilateral decision and ask us to file objections and suggestions after taking a call,” said N Venkateswara Rao of Venkatapalem village.

He said he had become a stakeholder of the project by giving his land and getting a returnable plot from the CRDA. He said he has the right to make submissions to the committee and the experts committee should have heard all the LPS farmers before finalising its report .

Another farmer, K Srinivasa Rao, demanded that the government should first make both the experts committee reports (GN Rao committee and BCG committee) open and allow the people to file their objections.

“Without the material mentioned, I will be handicapped to make submissions. It is against natural justice,” said Rao. The farmers asked the CRDA commissioner to provide the copies of expert committee reports. He also demanded the CRDA to release the experts’ committee reports in Telugu which could put the CRDA in a spot. The farmers also objected to the high-level committee comprising ministers and officials going through the contents of the reports without making them public documents.

Meanwhile, CRDA made special arrangements to accept suggestions and objections from farmers at the CRDA office as the high-level committee set a Friday deadline for the process.

NEW DELHI: According to the JNU administration, 6,140 students have registered for the winter session, accounting for 72.3% of the student population. Of these, 4,192 are hostel residents and 1,948 day scholars. The administration said these figures constituted 65% of the hostellers and 95% of day students. These claims were contested by JNUSU , which said the figures cited by the administration related actually to students who had cleared their mess dues.The university also extended the last date for registration by another two days to January 17. In a statement on Thursday, JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar said that there was a last minute rush on January 15, the last day, and students had approached the administration to extend the deadline for the winter semester registration.After the changes in the hostel fee structure, a hostel resident paid from Rs 3,008 to Rs 3,020 for a period of six month during the registration process. This includes Rs 1,800 for hostel rent for six months, Rs 1,100 as security deposit and Rs 108-120 as tuition fee.The VC’s statement also claimed, “All schools and centres have announced their time-tables and are working on conducting tests for those students who did not complete the last semester academic requirements. The university has been doing everything possible to help the students continue their academic activities. A great number of faculty members are actively working to make sure that the academic interests of the students are addressed.”JNUSU had called for a boycott of both classes and the winter semester registration process when the university refused to accede to the demand for the hostel fee hike rollback. The protests have been going on since October 28, when the Inter-Hall Administration meeting was disrupted because JNUSU representatives hadn’t been invited. The amended IHA manual was, nevertheless, passed, prompting immediate protests by the students.JNUSU asserted that the university administration was doling out misleading numbers. Contrary to the administration’s claims about the number of registrations, the students’ union maintained that only 40-45% students had registered. Satish Chandra, JNUSU general secretary, said, “The administration is giving incorrect data. They are counting those who have cleared their mess dues, claiming them as registrations. In fact, many students are yet to register and the boycott of the registration process will continue.""",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73324090,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-570232,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jnu-72-of-students-registered-for-session/articleshow/73310023.cms

Samajwadi Party (SP) candidate Shafikuzzama Ansari Babu registered victory in Saraiyya ward (66) of Varanasi Municipal Corporation (VMC) with 1,752 votes on Thursday, while Congress and BJP candidates finished at fourth and fifth positions, respectively. The seat had gone vacant after the death of Riyazuddin Ansari, father of the winning candidate.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos with partner Lauren Sanchez at an event on Thursday

MUMBAI: No matter what the analysts tell you, brick and mortar stores are here to stay. At least for as long as Jeff Bezos needs to cook. The wealthiest man in the world who introduced the world to online shopping carts is often found walking the aisles of a grocery store in Seattle, pushing that metal wire cart loaded with all that he needs to indulge his passion for cooking. “I’m not a good cook, but I like to cook. I just like to walk the aisles of a grocery store without a plan and then put together a meal,” said Bezos, on his first trip to Mumbai on Wednesday.

Love for the physical store isn’t limited to his own pleasures. The founder of the world’s largest online retail giant has been courting neighbourhood mom-and-pop stores in the country as delivery agents. “In fact, I just visited a tiny kirana store today which was an incredible experience. They do regular business but they also provide a space for online packages. I met this young man who helps his parents run the store and how it’s improved their lives to have this extra source of income was a moving experience,” said Bezos, while fielding questions from actor Shah Rukh Khan and filmmaker Zoya Akhtar at a gathering from the Indian film industry.

For Bezos, who has been to India thrice since his first trip 11 years ago, “there haven’t been perceptible changes of great magnitude” . But it is for those reasons that he finds the country endearing. “Certain thi-ngs are the same and I love those things. Every time I come here I see so much energy, dynamism and colour… everywhere you go and everything that you do, I’ve never seen more diversity in the world. Also, everybody here seems to be focused on self improvement. I get a boost of energy. I’m like wow, it’s so alive here,” he said.

The centi-billionaire worth $116 billion did not perfect his winning formula right at the outset, though. “I wanted to be an archaeologist and that was pre-Indiana Jones. Then I went to college wanting to be a physicist but realised half way through I wanted to pursue computer science which became my greatest passion and that’s how I ended up doing what I do,” Bezos recounted.

Clearly, time isn’t something that Bezos has on his hands, one would imagine but the man who at 56, is perhaps more occupied than most people are in the prime of their lives, dismisses the thought. “There’s this false idea that CEOs are under the most stress. No, but why? I’m a CEO and when you’re in charge you can delegate your stress. It’s not hard work that people dislike, it’s being out of control and I hate being over scheduled,” is how he put it.

If it’s his grandparents that Bezos considers his greatest influence, it is an unlikely item in his wardrobe that he credits as his “lucky” charm. “A pair of flashy Texan cowboy boots with red stars that you’ll see me wearing every time we send a rocket into the sky,” said Bezos, the space-obsessed cofounder of an aerospace company who revealed that the alien official in the last Star Trek film was “indeed me”.

Nahar decided to kill his paramour as she was not able to conceive

AGRA: Directions for an injection was all it took for Agra police to call out the bluff of a 35-year-old man who had allegedly murdered his paramour and was acting unconscious to escape with around Rs 1.5 lakh she had received as alimony.

Identified as Nahar Singh , a resident of Benai Kala village of Etmadpur police jurisdiction, the accused had on Wednesday night made a distress call to emergency helpline 112 informing them about an attack by a gang of robbers near Sikarata village. He claimed that they waylaid him while he was heading home along with his ‘wife’ Preeti (28) on a bike and robbed him of Rs 12,000 at gunpoint. He added that they even killed his ‘wife’ when she resisted the robbery bid.

Superintendent of police (rural west) Ravi Kumar said, “As Etmadpur police was conducting a raid in a nearby location in connection with another case, they rushed to the spot mentioned by Nahar along with the Dial 112 team. They then found him lying on road in a partially unconscious state. However, our personnel noticed that he didn’t have even a single scratch on his body and his wallet, mobile phone and bike were all intact while the woman was lying dead in a pool of blood.”

“The accused claimed that a gang attacked them and killed his wife before fleeing with cash. Our team immediately cordoned off the area and sent both of them to S N Medical College. While the woman was declared brought dead, the accused was lying in an ‘unconscious’ state even though doctors could not find any injury mark. Suspecting foul play, our team asked doctors if they can use an injection to help him gain consciousness, on hearing which the accused jumped up from the bed and tried to escape,” he added.

The SP further said, “After conducting a thorough medical check-up, we decided to question the accused. He soon confessed that Preeti was a divorcee with whom he was in a live-in relationship for many months. Though he was planning to settle down with her, he was unhappy as she was not able to conceive a baby boy. Hence, decided to eliminate her to steal the money she had received as alimony.”

Police said that Nahar is already married and has three daughters. They registered a case against him under IPC section 302 ( murder ) based on a written complaint lodged by Preeti’s relatives.

At the time of filing this report, a panel of doctors were conducting an autopsy of the victim to ascertain the cause of death. Police sources, however, claimed that the victim was probably killed by a sharp-edged instrument as the skin on her head was peeled off.

NEW DELHI: As free schemes take centre stage ahead of Delhi assembly polls , Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is planning to give guarantee cards to the people of the national capital. The cards will guarantee people 200 units of free electricity and 20,000 litres of free water per month for the next five years, apart from free bus ride for women and free pilgrimage scheme for senior citizens. The party is also mulling appointment of “mohalla marshals” in several areas to make them secure.The guarantee cards will be delivered to the residents in all 70 assembly constituencies well before the assembly polls, which are scheduled to take place on February 8. AAP Rajya Sabha MP ND Gupta said that the guarantee cards and the party’s poll manifestos are likely to be distributed separately. We are planning to distribute guarantee cards before the manifestos, sources said.Gupta said that the appointment of “mohalla marshals” may find a mention in the party’s manifesto. “These marshals would be deployed as security persons in various mohallas and would be paid by the government for their services.”Free welfare schemes of the AAP government have found many supporters in Delhi. In a bid to capitalise on the love of people for the free schemes, Delhi Congress has also announced that if elected to power, the party will give monthly 600 units of electricity and 20,000 litres of water free.AAP and BJP functionaries have been locking horns over the free welfare schemes of late. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and other leaders have repeatedly claimed that the saffron party would stop free services like electricity, water and bus rides for women, if it came to power in Delhi. AAP MP Sanjay Singh had on Wednesday got into a confrontation with BJP parliamentarian Gautam Gambhir on the issue. “BJP functionary Anil Jain had said that his party was against any kind of free services to people. Now, Gambhir has contradicted the claims made by Manoj Tiwari,” Singh said.Hitting out at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Gambhir had said that he was not against free services for poor, but those who could afford them should pay nominal charges. Singh alleged that BJP leaders were continuously opposing the free welfare schemes of the AAP government.Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari has, however, clarified that no existing subsidy started by the AAP government would be altered. On Thursday, he again slammed AAP leaders who have been claiming that BJP would stop the free welfare schemes if it came to power in Delhi.“AAP leaders are habitual liars and always twist the facts to suit their interests. After coming to power, BJP will give five times the benefits given by the AAP government.

Vijayawada: The three day-long Sankranti celebrations concluded in the city on Thursday. Citizens celebrated Kanuma, the third day of Sankranti, with great religious fervour.

People did pooja for cattle and offered special prayers to vehicles to as part of the Sankranti Kanuma celebrations. Cattle used to play a significant role in farming before advanced technology and machinery came into use. So as a thanks, farmers worship cattle on Kanuma day, acknowledging their services. “Kanuma day is considered as a day of rest for cattle. We decorate the bulls, cow, sheep on this day and offer them fodder and prayers. Cattle are considered as family members in the Nuzividu region of the state,” said K Ramanna, a farmer from Mylavaram.

Meat markets in the city were crowded right from early hours of Thursday morning. The cost of country chicken, mutton, and fish sky-rocketed due to the festival demand. “Hosting feasts is an important part of celebrations on the last day of the Sankranti. But this year, we have minimised our lists considering the soaring price of meat. Cost of onions, cooking oil has also increased and it affected our celebrations,” said M Lavanya, a home-maker from the city.

Meanwhile, Sankranti celebrations conducted by the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) ended on a high note on Wednesday. Endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivas, who attended the programme as chief guest, appreciated the way the event was conducted by VMC officials. “Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has asked officials across all 13 districts to conduct Sankranti celebration on a grand scale. Our government is giving top priority to culture and tradition. Sankranti is a harvest festival and our officials brought the village atmosphere to the city. It is our responsibility to continue our traditions and culture for future generations,” the minister said.

VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh and his wife participated in the traditional Mr and Mrs Ramp Walk conducted at the event.

Krishna district collector A Md Imtiaz, MLA Malladi Vishnuvardhan presented the prizes to the winners of Rangoli, dance, singing and cooking competitions conducted as a part of the celebrations.

97,['17/01/2020'],EOW books gutka manufacturers for Rs 1900 cr GST fraud,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh EOW on Thursday booked four directors of Kaipan Pan Products Private Limited for allegedly evading GST (goods and services tax) worth Rs 1900 crore through fraudulent means. EOW had raided business establishments of prominent pan masala and gutka manufacturers in Bhopal, Indore and Gwalior following complaints of massive tax evasion. Several child labourers were rescued during the operation, said officials.

“The timing of the raid was very important. We found labourers working at 4.30 am. What kind of shift is it? There were no records of stock, materials and labourers working at the unit. We have enough evidence to prosecute them,” said an EOW officer, wishing anonymity.

When contacted, EOW DG Sushovan Banerjee confirmed the action and said strong steps would be taken against those involved. the directors have been booked under section 420 (forgery), 120 (criminal conspiracy) of IPC or and 122 of GST Act.

Raids were conducted at factories of some of the top brands in Govindpura at around 4.30am. Separate teams had raided other gutka companies in Indore and Gwalior. The raid team in the state capital was led by EOW SP Arun Mishra. Ready stocks worth more than Rs 5 crore were found at these units. EOW had shortlisted these companies immediately after chief minister Kamal Nath ordered a crackdown last week.

On January 3, in his first meeting of the year with bureaucrats, CM Nath had said: “Shudh Ke Liye Yudh is a massive drive that is gathering popularity through public support. But there needs to be action against gutka and paan masala sellers, apart from cartels involved in the manufacture and supply of fake medicines.”

“Unaccounted’ packs are sent off to different destinations. They have 40 labourers only to load packs of gutka pouches in trucks, so you can imagine the amount of gutha that is produced and supplied from this factory alone.”

Knowing that the clandestinely produced gutka is loaded in trucks early in the morning, the EOW team raided the unit at 4.30am. As they detected more illegal activities — like child labour and mixing of tobacco in gutka— personnel from departments like labour, revenue, commercial tax, excise, central excise and police also joined the operation.

Officials said that the government has been trying to plug leakage of revenue from gutka and tobacco companies. Excise duty is calculated under ‘Pan Masala Packing Machines (Capacity Determination and Collection of Duty) Rules, 2008’, modified in 2010, and ranges from Rs 14 lakh to Rs 77 lakh, depending upon the price per packet of pan masala (non-tobacco) and production capacity of machines. For flavoured supari, the tariff is charged on MRP and duty is calculated at 2.36% per packet, excluding 35% abatement.

It is alleged that the companies have been under-reporting the capacity of their machines in collusion with a section regulatory officials. Company officials tried to argue that some of the machines were not in use. “Each and every machine was in use when the unit was raided. Number of labourers made it clear that the production was being under reported,’ said the EOW officer, adding that mismatch has been found in the declaration and production capacity of machines.

Mangaluru: A poster released as part of the three-day international kite festival is in Tulu . The festival will be held at the Panambur Beach from Friday.

The poster by artist Dinesh Holla , that is being shared on social media, has a line written in the Tulu script that reads, ‘ Kudla International Kite Festival ’.

Dinesh Holla told TOI that the poster has the picture of Koti- Chennaya, the legendary Tuluva twin heroes, and Aati Kalenja, an ancient traditional folk art.

“This is an attempt to draw the attention of the people towards vanishing art forms of Tulunadu,” he said. Holla has designed nearly 19 publicity posters for the festival, all highlighting the art and culture of the region. Since he is not an expert in the Tulu script, he has also designed a few posters that are in the Kannada script, but in the Tulu language. Most of the posters are based on the theme Yakshagana, Bhoota Kola, fishing, kambla and other such activities.

International kite flyers have begun arriving in Mangaluru.

The three-day international kite festival is being held as part of the Karavali Utsav.

Use of the Tulu script, and the demand seeking inclusion of Tulu in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution has picked up in recent years. Recently, Dilraj Alva, owner of Sri Ganesh Prasad (SGP) buses that operate between State Bank terminus and Mangaladevi, painted one of the SGP buses on route 27 with Tulu vowels and hashtags : #Tuluto8thschedule and #TuluofficiallnKA_K, in order to support the campaign.

Vadodara: It’s getting riskier to stop people peeing outside others’ houses in the Banyan City. A day after a labourer was stabbed in Angadh for stopping two people from relieving themselves outside his house, an auto rickshaw driver, Vijay Vankar, was attacked with a knife on Wednesday for exactly the same reason in Kishanwadi.

Vankar was attacked when he confronted the accused trio, Alpesh Thakor, Arjun Machhi and Anko asking them not to pee outside his house. Vankar told the police that Thakor, who allegedly runs a liquor den in the locality, and his clients used to relieve themselves near Vankar’s house on the ground floor of a government housing scheme.

Vankar’s wife Hema oftened complained about the stench emanating from the urine near their house. On Wednesday evening when Vankar was returning home from work, he saw the three accused sitting outside a barber’s shop near his house. He approached them about the problem of severe stench. But instead of listening to his plaint, Thakor used casteist slur against Vankar which enraged him and they got into a brawl.

In his complaint Vankar said that Thakor pulled out a knife and asked Anko to stab him. However, Vankar sat down when Anko was about to attack him, thus saving his life. Then Thakor and Machhi held Vankar while Anko hurled the knife on his forehead. Vankar got severe cuts and bled profusely from his forehead, but the hoodlums continued to kick and thrash him.

When his wife and a friend came to his rescue, the trio even beat up his wife. Vankar was taken to Jamnabai Hospital for treatment and was later referred to SSG Hospital. Vankar registered an offence of assault, causing hurt, criminal intimidation and under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. However, cops are yet to arrest the trio.

Agra/Meerut/Bareilly: Heavy rain and hailstorm lashed western Uttar Pradesh on Thursday throwing normal life out of gear. Meanwhile, IMD officials have said that the prevailing conditions are likely to continue for two or three days, with the region likely to receive more rains.

While Agra received over 4mm rainfall on Thursday, chilly winds brought the temperature in the city down by around 12 degrees. Officials of the Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) operated gas heaters at over a dozen places apart from lighting bonfires in other spots. The air quality also improved on Thursday with the city recording an AQI of 174 (moderate). On Tuesday, the same was 314.

In Meerut, Thursday’s rainfall of 5mm broke a two-year record of maximum monthly rains received in the city. The maximum monthly rainfall received in January this year is 25.2mm as compared to 17.6mm in 2017. Heavy rains and hailstorm accompanied with fog led to an increase in AQI — from 204 to 232. The maximum and minimum temperatures recorded in the city were 15.4 degrees Celsius and 9 degrees Celsius respectively. While the maximum temperature was six degrees below normal, the minimum was two degrees above normal.

Raj Kumar, meteorological department in-charge of Meerut region, said, “Cloudy sky with one or two spells of rain or thundershowers is likely on Friday and Saturday followed by dense fog next week.”

In Bareilly, there was a nip in the air due to mild showers across the city. While 1.2mm rainfall was received on Thursday, IMD officials have predicted more in the coming days. The maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 19 degrees Celsius and 12.5 degrees Celsius respectively.

Ashish Singh, a local resident said, “For the past few days, there was some relief from the winter chill especially during afternoons. Mild rain on Thursday has further intensified the cold.”

Weather expert Neeru Agarwal said, “Mild to moderate rainfall occurred in the city due to western disturbances. Though it didn’t make much difference to the minimum and maximum temperatures, it has revived chilly winds. Cloudy weather conditions will prevail for the next couple of days and city is likely to receive light to moderate showers.”

Similarly, rainfall and hailstorm also lashed parts of Firozabad, Mathura, Etah, Aligarh and Mainpuri districts.

GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat Food and Drug Control Authority (FDCA) will embark on a state-wide drive to check the quality of milk at the village level before it is handed over to local co-operative societies. Action will be initiated against milk producers if samples of milk are found to be either unhygienic or adulterated, FDCA officials said.

In addition, FDCA will also launch a drive against unorganized dairies to check milk adulteration. “These dairies sell unpacked milk and they will be checked as well,” the official said.

The drive will be conducted in association with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).

H G Koshiya, commissioner, Gujarat FDCA said that while big milk processing plants like those of Amul have facilities to check milk according to FSSAI standards, there is no mechanism to check milk for adulteration or hygiene at the village level before milk producers deposit their milk with village co-operatives. “The state government has decided to start checking the quality of milk at source when farmers milk cows or buffaloes. Whether farmers draw milk in hygienic conditions or not or whether any adulteration is done will now be checked at the village level,” he said. The official added that a database of all milk producers will be sought from the major milk cooperatives.”

CM Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurates Kerala Literature Festival in Kozhikode on Thursday

KOZHIKODE: It’s an era of intolerance and hatred. It started when the Sangh Parivar took dominance over the Indian politics, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said while opening the fifth edition of Kerala Literature Festival here on Thursday

There is a group that’s trying to lead the youth into the darkness, he said adding that “one thought that is being promoted widely now is that everything that was practised in the olden days was noble and they should be rejuvenated. By promoting such ideas, some people are trying to establish non-progressive attitude among the youths. The attempt is to attract the youths to ultra-nationalism and communalism by promoting such sentiments. If such attempts turn fruitful it would disintegrate our country.”

Meanwhile, the government has extended support to Kerala Literature Festival for setting up a permanent venue taking into account their contribution towards the society. “The young generation should be driven towards secularism, democracy and rational thinking. The Kerala Literature Festival is making the right intervention at the right time to drive the youth towards progressive thinking,” he said.

Dr Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, minister of climate change and environment for the UAE, attended the inaugural session. Minister for tourism Kadakampally Surendran and others were also present for the inaugural session. In another session ‘National Anthem: The National Treasure,’ T M Krishna, musician and author, discussed the national anthem as a poetic masterpiece and national treasure.

KLF is being held at five different venues and the curtain will fall on Sunday.

National Highway-169, which connects Mangaluru, Moodbidri and Karakala, which will be widened

Mangaluru: The action committee of residents who are likely to lose their land due to widening of NH-169 (earlier NH-13), are apprehensive about the compensation they are supposed to receive.

Union ministry of road transport and highways has issued a public notice to residents of Mangaluru, Karkala and Moodbidri taluks, whose land will be acquired for widening of the national highway between Mangaluru and Moodbidri. Residents of Sanooru in Karkala, Beluvai, Padu Marnadu, Thodaru, Thenka Mijaru in Moodbidri and Badaga Edapadau, Badaga Ulipady, Moodu Perar, Kandavara, Mulooru, Thiruvailu and Kudupu in Mangaluru taluk, have been directed to appear with all documents pertaining to their land, before the special land acquisition officer. While residents of Karkala and Moodbidri have been asked to produce documents on January 22, land owners of Mangaluru taluk have been directed to visit on January 23.

However, Residents of 17 villages in Mangaluru and Moodbidri taluks led by Rashtriya Heddari 169 (13) Mangaluru-Moodbidri Rasthe Agalikarana Bumalakara Horatta Samiti have been questioning the compensation pattern. Samiti president and advocate Mariamma Thomas told TOI that a final notification for the land acquisition was made in 2017.

Hence, the compensation will be awarded as per the 2017 notification. However, the land value has been increased in the past three years, but the same has not been considered while calculating the compensation to be paid to land owners, Mariamma said.

“We will point out the technical errors in the compensation to be distributed to landowners at the meeting to be convened by the district administration and National Highways Authority of India on Monday. Those who are losing their land will be receiving compensation as per the rate fixed in 2017, and increase in the market value due to inflation has not been considered. Residents will be eligible to receive only the interest for the compensation,” she said, adding that the samiti will take a decision on the future course of action soon.

Nashik: Parisar, a Pune-based non-government organisation, is conducting a survey of five non-attainment smart cities of Maharashtra, including Nashik, and the findings are to be released once the study is over.

Apart from Nashik, other cities include Aurangabad, Nagpur, Pune and Solapur.

The NGO officials were here in Nashik on Thursday. They met the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and smart city officials, and took information on the measures being taken to improve the air quality in the city.

The NGO said it has already conducted the study of other cities. “We are studying the air quality of five non-attainment cities of Maharashtra, which are also smart cities, to see what the smart city officials and municipal corporations are doing to improve air quality,” said Sharmila Deo, a senior official of the NGO.

“We have conducted the study of the other four cities. We will prepare a collective report of all the five cities in Maharashtra and release it thereafter. It will take a month to complete the process,” she said.

NMC officials said the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) is an authority to check the air quality of the city and there are four air quality monitoring stations. The officials also talked about the action plan the civic body had prepared to tackle air pollution and measures being taken for the implementation of the action plan.

The officials said that Nashik had been included among 100 air polluted cities around two years ago. “We can’t comment on this as this is the jurisdiction of the pollution authority,” they said.

“But the quality of air in Nashik city is good. The city is also known for its good climate. Therefore, we are also studying the matter — through a private educational institute — to find out why the city was included among the list of 100 air-polluted cities in the country,” said NMC officials.

The NGO officials also met the smart city officials and held a discussion on the air quality.

However, the students, who have been demanding the resignation of the VC and the registrar holding them responsible for the alleged excesses by security forces on December 15, refused to relent.

Reiterating that he regrets the hardships and inconvenience faced by students due to the police action, Mansoor said, “The police entry was an aberration. They have no role in the working of the university. Law and order on campus will henceforth be maintained by the university authorities.” He once again clarified that he had given permission to police only to restore normalcy and not to enter the residential premises.

The VC also urged the students to cooperate with the visiting National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) team and the fact-finding committee headed by Justice V K Gupta.

Students’ leader Faizul Hassan, who is also a member of AMU coordination committee, said that the students are not satisfied by the explanation given by the VC.

Varanasi: Agroup of managers of affiliated colleges of Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth (MGKV) have been charged with misbehaving and beating women security guards of MGKV Proctorial Board after being stopped from entering the administrative building on Thursday. The managers were reportedly demanding withdrawal of fee hike.

Taking serious note of the incident, MGKV vice-chancellor Prof TN Singh has ordered lodging named FIR against the accused after identifying them through CCTV footage. He said the managers also staged demonstration without seeking any prior permission.

Reports said managers of about 10 affiliated colleges, along with their supporters reached the administrative building on Thursday afternoon. The VC said after they sought appointment, he allowed only five persons to meet him at 11am. But they reached the campus along with their supporters. When the women Proctorial Board personnel tried to stop them, they attacked and misbehaved with them. They also staged a demonstration demanding immediate withdrawal of fee hike, he added.

Talking to TOI, the VC said: “I had agreed to meet their five-member delegation. They were informed that fee hike had been made in view of the circular of the state government for universities to arrange funds from their own resources to meet expenses of increased wages of invigilators, examiners, installation of CCTV cameras in examination rooms, improving quality of printing of question papers and others.”

The decision of fee hike had been taken by the finance committee and cannot be changed by any individual, he added.

There are over 300 colleges affiliated with MGKV, but the managers of less than a dozen colleges are demanding withdrawal of fee hike, he said and added that the footage of misbehaviour and manhandling women security guards are being reviewed to identify the assailants and lodge a named FIR against them, he added.

Hyderabad: Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy on Thursday pulled up railway officials and Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel after he found the door frame metal detector at Secunderabad railway station to be defunct.

Kishan Reddy was at the Secunderabad station to catch a train to a municipality as part of BJP municipal elections campaign.

Kishan Reddy was on his way to Bellampalli, Narsapur, Godavarikhani and Ramagundam municipalities.

SCR principal chief security commissioner GM Eswara Rao told TOI, “The door frame metal detector is supposed to beep when a passenger walks in with a metal item. It was not working when minister Kishan Reddy came to the station due to a technical issue. We have replaced it. We have also asked for more door frame metal detectors.”

Secunderabad railway station handles around 1.25 lakh passengers during festive season.

“We will be deploying additional forces from Railway Protection Special Force (RPSF). Currently, the RPF is short-staffed. We have sought 780 new personnel for RPF and they are undergoing training. There will soon be greater security at the railway stations and platforms. To temporarily sort out the problem, we are roping in special forces,” said Eswara Rao.

A member of an anti-terror cop squad said, “Secunderabad was on Lashkar-e-Toiba’s hit list. During Sankranti, there is huge rush of passengers. RPF and Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel shall ensure the safety and security of passengers.”

Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said that the sitting MLAs who had been denied tickets for the upcoming assembly polls were a part of the AAP family and would continue to be so.

Kejriwal dismissed the opposition’s allegations that some of the party candidates had a tainted background and stressed that AAP was committed to its 3Cs formula, according to which people with a criminal background, or those who were corrupt or of bad character would not be included in the party.

“We came into politics to make it clean. It was because of our clean politics that we were able to deliver so much (in the last five years). We will keep our commitment to 3Cs always,” Kejriwal said at a press conference.

On allegations from certain quarters that the party had “sold” tickets, Kejriwal said myriad charges were levelled by people when they were denied tickets. Badarpur and Seelmapur MLAs Narayan Dutt Sharma and Ishraq Khan have openly made their displeasure known after being snubbed.

While 46 of the 61 sitting MLAs have been given another chance, the remaining have been dropped after a series of qualitative and quantitative surveys conducted by the party and private agencies to assess their performance and winnability. Most of the dropped MLAs have maintained a stoic silence, but some have made no effort to hide their disappointment.

Asked if the party was talking to the dropped MLAs, Kejriwal said all parties would make efforts to poach them. “They are a part of our family and I hope they will remain so,” he replied to a query.

The AAP leadership has been trying to reach out to the “disappointed” MLAs and convince them that the party is with them. Three dropped MLAs, Ram Chander from Bawana, Sukhbir Singh Dalal from Mundka and Surinder Singh from Delhi Cantonment, made an appearance at the party office and joined the inauguration of Rajendra Nagar candidate Raghav Chadha’s office, a day after being denied tickets. It was projected as a sign of everything being fine in the party. AAP has stressed that the dropped MLAs will be given positions in the party and, after the election, in the government.

While some of the MLAs are said to be exploring all options, Seelampur MLA Ishraq Khan is reportedly likely to join Congress. A person close to the MLA stated that he was in touch with Congress functionaries and may contest the election on its ticket from Babarpur.

In the middle of a press conference organised by Khan on Wednesday, former Congress MLA from Seelampur, Mateen Ahmad, had dropped in and appreciated the work done by him.

What is distressing though is that the number of persons who are overweight has been rising consistently.Experts and nutritionists do not see this worrisome trend being arrested any time soon, saying the falling consumption of home-made food is one of the major contributors to obesity.A comparison of the NFHS-4 survey, commissioned in 2015-16, and the SFHS survey done in 2019, shows that there has been a 0.8 percentage point increase in the number of women who are overweight or obese.Similarly, the percentage of overweight or obese men has increased by 2.9 percentage points.Nutritionists and experts believe the increase in obesity among both men and women is growing at a much higher rate than what these surveys indicate.Health experts and nutritionists say that the problem of obesity is now increasing among teenagers as well. “I have a lot of teenagers coming in for weight loss. The trend of eating out and not cooking at home is dangerous. Almost all restaurants are full on weekends. This has directly affected the consumption of home-cooked food,” says Binaifer Lalkaka, a lifestyle management health coach.Nutritionist Arya Singh says that with increasingly both husband and wife working, it becomes difficult for the family to have home-cooked food, which reflects in the huge spurt in people ordering food online.“People realise the need to lose weight, but the majority perhaps do not know the right methods,” she said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73318962,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-596517,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/one-in-two-gujarat-adults-is-obese-or-underweight/articleshow/73310293.cms

NEW DELHI: Several hoardings with slogans like “Desh jalana bandh karo” (stop burning the country) and “Left attacks students/JNU” with the photos of ABVP activists injured in the JNU violence appeared near Law Faculty and Ramjas College on Delhi University’s North Campus on Thursday.

Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad-led Delhi University Students’ Union claimed it had put up the hoardings to expose the Left organisations. The hoardings also had photos of the protests against Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens.

DUSU president Akshit Dahiya said, “On the DU campus, different student organisations have been coming together and spreading negativity on the campus.”

Objecting to the hoardings, National Students’ Union of India (NSUI)-Delhi president Akshay Lakra said, “It’s sad to see wastage of the students’ union budget by ABVP to spread the rightist propaganda. Despite having been exposed many times, ABVP still hasn’t accepted its defeat in its own propaganda.” .

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said that the sitting MLAs who had been denied tickets for the upcoming assembly polls were a part of the AAP family and would continue to be so.Kejriwal dismissed the opposition’s allegations that some of the party candidates had a tainted background and stressed that AAP was committed to its 3Cs formula, according to which people with a criminal background, or those who were corrupt or of bad character would not be included in the party.“We came into politics to make it clean. It was because of our clean politics that we were able to deliver so much (in the last five years). We will keep our commitment to 3Cs always,” Kejriwal said at a press conference.On allegations from certain quarters that the party had “sold” tickets, Kejriwal said myriad charges were levelled by people when they were denied tickets. Badarpur and Seelmapur MLAs Narayan Dutt Sharma and Ishraq Khan have openly made their displeasure known after being snubbed.While 46 of the 61 sitting MLAs have been given another chance, the remaining have been dropped after a series of qualitative and quantitative surveys conducted by the party and private agencies to assess their performance and winnability. Most of the dropped MLAs have maintained a stoic silence, but some have made no effort to hide their disappointment.Asked if the party was talking to the dropped MLAs, Kejriwal said all parties would make efforts to poach them. “They are a part of our family and I hope they will remain so,” he replied to a query.The AAP leadership has been trying to reach out to the “disappointed” MLAs and convince them that the party is with them. Three dropped MLAs, Ram Chander from Bawana, Sukhbir Singh Dalal from Mundka and Surinder Singh from Delhi Cantonment, made an appearance at the party office and joined the inauguration of Rajendra Nagar candidate Raghav Chadha’s office, a day after being denied tickets. It was projected as a sign of everything being fine in the party. AAP has stressed that the dropped MLAs will be given positions in the party and, after the election, in the government.While some of the MLAs are said to be exploring all options, Seelampur MLA Ishraq Khan is reportedly likely to join Congress. A person close to the MLA stated that he was in touch with Congress functionaries and may contest the election on its ticket from Babarpur.In the middle of a press conference organised by Khan on Wednesday, former Congress MLA from Seelampur, Mateen Ahmad, had dropped in and appreciated the work done by him.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73316066,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-167851,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/kejriwal-dismisses-talk-about-some-candidates-having-criminal-records/articleshow/73316475.cms

Amaravati: In a major initiative, the state government has cleared decks for taking up comprehensive drinking water projects in six districts with Rs.12,308 crore.

The projects have been planned to cater to the needs of water starving regions like Palnadu in Guntur and Uddanam in Srikakulam district.

The Palnadu water grid project will be taken up with Rs.2665 crore while Rs.700 crore would be spent on Uddanam area drinking water project.

“It is the fulfillment of yet another promise made before the general elections. Our leader Jagan has promised to take up the water project during his padayatra and cleared the permissions within seven months after coming into power,” said Gurazala legislator Kasu Mahesh Reddy.

He said that he had submitted the project report to Jagan during his padayatra in the constituency and got the promise. He said that the scheme would serve nearly 15 lakh people of seven assembly constituencies in Palnadu region.

Similarly, comprehensive drinking water projects in East Godavari would be taken up with Rs.3960 crore and West Godavari projects to get Rs.3670 crore.

The proposals have been hanging in the balance for several years. Palnadu people will never forget chief minister YS Jagan for his gesture,” said Mahesh Reddy.

The projects have been planned to cater to the needs of water starving regions like Palnadu in Guntur and Uddanam in Srikakulam district.

Police said that Prajapati’s friend Dharmendra who works under the accused had not been paid salary for over a month. As Prajapati was asking them to pay the salary for quite some time, they got enraged and decided to teach him a lesson.

“The accused said that the deceased had nothing to do with the issue, yet he was trying to interfere which they did not like,” said a police official. On January 13, the accused beat up Prajapati on the outskirts of his native Kunvarpura village in Dabhoi taluka. After the attack, Prajapati went home and slept. But in the evening when his father tried to wake him up, he did not respond. Prajapati’s neighbour called GVK-EMRI 108 ambulance. The paramedical staff declared him dead. His father told cops that Prajapati had succumbed to internal injuries.

Nashik: The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) headquarters has directed its Nashik regional office to undertake a survey of the Satpur and Ambad industrial estates to ascertain the quantum of industrial effluents generated in both the areas and how much is being discharged into different nullahs linked to the Godavari river without undergoing treatment.

The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had told the MPCB that it would not construct underground sewer lines in these two industrial areas of the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC).

Top authorities of the NMC and MPCB recently conducted a meeting on the issue at Mumbai where the municipal corporation reiterated its stand that it would not be feasible for it to undertake construction of underground sewer lines.

The NMC also made it clear that it would not return the Sewerage Benefit Tax which is part of property tax being collected by MIDC from industrial units in both the estates. The MPCB had recently directed the NMC to return the tax amount it collected in the past if it is adamant on not constructing underground drainage lines in both the industrial areas.

“Instructions have been given by our head office to conduct survey of total effluent generated in both the industrial areas. The report is to be submitted to our head office after the completion of the survey. It will take at least a month to conduct the survey,” said sources from the regional office of MPCB.

“MIDC is supplying water to industrial units in both the said areas. The survey will include how much water is being supplied in each of the industrial units and how much effluents are being generated from the total water supply. Moreover, the survey will also list down the industries that have their own Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) and how many do not have the effluent treatment system,” said MPCB sources.

Vice president Venkiah Naidu

CHENNAI: Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday found himself in the midst of a controversy over attempts to ‘saffronise’ Tamil saint-poet Thiruvalluvar . But, even as his tweet created a stir, it was hurriedly deleted.

“Remembering great Tamil Poet, philosopher and Saint, Thiruvalluvar on his Jayanti today. #Thirukkural, authored by him provides guidance to mankind on how to lead a noble life,” Naidu said in his tweet. “Considered as one of the greatest classics in #Tamil #Literature on morality, values and ethics, the treatise on a variety of subjects, including governance remains relevant for all times. #Thiruvalluvar,” he further said in the tweet.

This tweet, from the official handle @VPSecretariat of the Vice President of India looked innocuous at first glance, especially as it came on January 16, which is observed in Tamil Nadu as Thiruvalluvar Day. But, it soon caused a stir as Thiruvalluvar was in a saffron robe as against the usual white, and brought back memories of a recent tweet of the Tamil Nadu unit of the BJP, showing Thiruvalluvar in a saffron robe, created quite a furore.

As if wanting to avoid any political fallout, the VP’s office quickly deleted the tweet. “The earlier tweet was posted by mistake by a staff of Vice President Secretariat and was deleted soon after it was noticed,” it said, in a fresh tweet. This time, Thiruvalluvar too was back in his usual white robe.

DMK MP from Dharmapuri S Senthil Kumar thanked Naidu for heeding the request and deleting the earlier tweet. “Thank you Vice-president Respected Venkiah Sir, Much respect and regards for deleting the Saffronised Thiruvalluvar picture and replacing with the Government official picture as requested,” the MP tweeted.

But, BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit was back with a tweet on Thiruvalluvar Day wishes. It carried a picture of Thiruvalluvar in a saffron robe. In a tweet, it even sought to link BJP’s election symbol ‘Lotus’ with Thirukkural. “One who bathes in a lotus pond will not seek another pond. Likewise, one who reads Thirukkural will not seek another book,” it said in a tweet, along with a picture of a saffronised Thiruvalluvar.

Later, it also sought to condemn a reported directive of the Malaysian government that asked Muslims not to partake in Pongal celebrations, by terming it a Hindu festival. Saying it was an attempt by Malaysia to separate Muslims from Tamils, the BJP tweet condemned the move.

However, there was a backlash soon after, with people questioning the party for poking its nose in the affairs of another country while seeking to create a division between the Hindu majority and the Muslim minorities at home. Some of them had even posted pictures of Muslim families in Malaysia celebrating Pongal.

The state BJP unit also sought to give a Hindu twist to 'jallikattu', a bull sport popular during the Pongal festival, by calling it a Hindu tradition.

Aligarh Muslim University

AGRA: A number of AMU faculty members and retired teachers took out a peaceful protest march against CAA and NRC on the campus on Thursday.

Shouting slogans, the protesters took out a rally from the staff club to Duck Point. They said, “We express our anguish, shock and strong condemnation on the passage of the discriminatory and anti-secular Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) that has linked citizenship to religion. It has been opined by the Supreme Court in a number of cases that secularism enshrined in the Preamble is the basic feature of the Constitution.”

“We appreciate the initiative taken by the students of Jamia Millia Islamia, Aligarh Muslim University , JNU and other universities against this unlawful Act. Their sacrifices will make history. The lack of far-sightedness of the AMU administration is clear,” they added.

They also strongly condemned the lathicharge, firing and brutality shown by the police against students in both AMU and JMI that left several injured.

The protesters said that the AMU administration has entirely failed to use the age-old system of pro-proctors, proctorial team, teachers and alumni to meet exigencies on the campus. “We consider the acts of AMU administration unnecessary and uncalled for. Students have full right to peacefully demonstrate against any injustice without hampering their studies and examinations. Therefore, we appeal to the students to attend classes, appear for examinations and remain non-violent in protests,” they added.

Bhopal: A week after declaring Deepika Padukone-starrer ‘Chhapaak’ tax-free in the state,chief minister Kamal Nath on Thursday asked officials to wage a war against open sale of acid in MP. Nath said that cases of acid attacks can be curbed through exemplary punishment and public awareness.

“It is very important to curb the open sale of acid in the state. Instructions have been issued to run a campaign across the state,” tweeted Nath.

The chief minister had on January 9 declared Bollywood movie `Chhapaak', based on the story of an acid survivor, as tax-free in the state. The movie actress Deepika Padukone has already expressed her concern over the issue, saying it is very disturbing to find the ease with which shopkeepers are selling acid after asking casual questions like ‘why do you need it?’ Nath. in his tweet, said it is not just enough to declare the movie tax-free, but there is a need to create awareness about it.

Nath said, “There is a need to create awareness along with strict action to prevent such incidents. The culprits should be given severe punishment and we will ensure this.”

Nath also said that severe action must be taken to curb incidents of acid attacks on women. “We will fix responsibility in all such cases. The incidents of acid attack are a sign of barbarism and brutality. This needs to be stopped,"" he said.

According to latest data released by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Madhya Pradesh is fourth among the 10 worst states in term of acid attacks from 2014 to 2018.

Ahmedabad: Senior director and principal engineer for advanced rendering and visualisation at Intel, Jim Jeffers, will introduce design students to using high-fidelity ray-tracing technology for product design at the Ahmedabad Design Week, which has been organized by the Karnavati University on Friday.

“Ray tracing supported by a high-level of computing by Intel, produces a high degree of visual realism. The technology’s state of the art algorithm delves into the complex physics of light to produce the maximum realism,” says Jeffers.

He added that the technology generates an image by tracing the light path as pixels in an image plane and simulates the effects of its encounters with virtual objects. “During a live demonstration on Friday I will connect to Intel’s data centre in US to render a whole graphic visualisation. I want students to unleash their imagination through the power of ray tracing for designing automobiles, architecture and in product design. I will also show how the technology’s computational power can be unleashed for processing images of cloth, fluids, hair and more,” said Jeffers.

He said India holds immense potential for Intel’s ray-tracing technology. “I want to introduce Intel’s high-performance visual libraries like Embree and our microtools. We are now designing GPUs to take advantage of ray-tracing technologies. We see India taking the leadership in using these tools led by its design institutions,” says Jeffers.

On how ray-tracing differs from conventional 3D rendering, Jeffers says, “The ray tracing algorithm creates realistic effects by calculating reflections and shadows, which are difficult to simulate using other algorithms. The parallel computational independence makes ray-tracing more efficient than other technologies.”

141,['17/01/2020'],Delhi: How police nipped protest at Turkman Gate in the bud,"PROTEST OUTSIDE THE TURKMAN GATE AGAINST CAA IN OLD DELHI ON THURSDAY. PHOTO BY RAJESH MEHTA

NEW DELHI: Chaos reigned at Turkman Gate on Thursday as protesters tried to block Asaf Ali Road and organise a sit-in protest against Citizenship Amendment Act. However, this time Delhi Police was well-prepared owing to intelligence inputs. The gathering was dispersed quickly in the early hours to prevent a Shaheen Bagh re-run. Though the protesters returned in the evening, police managed to contain them to the bylanes.Learning from their mistake at Shaheen Bagh — where they had presumed that the gathering would be small and isolated, but ended in a huge protest — police were more alert. When the handful of protesters tried to put up resistance, as video footage showed, they were evicted from the area and detained.The entire stretch of Asaf Ali Road around Turkman Gate was barricaded after 2am. The protesters were not allowed to squat or set up tents. A large group of women personnel were deployed to deal with women protesters. A warning was also issued to the speakers against inflammatory speeches.The leaders of the protesting groups were asked not to stop the flow of traffic. The day was also saved after an informal meeting with religious leaders of the area and the women protesters. Because of this, the agitation failed to gain momentum, unlike Shaheen Bagh and Khureji.Initially, police were taken aback when the protesters led by some residents of Shaheen Bagh and Jafrabad occupied the footpath outside Turkman Gate and started setting up plastic sheets and shamianas. They also got into a verbal spat with the policemen when asked to move away. However, they were soon convinced to limit the protest to the footpath with 50-60 people.The crowd started swelling when women and children from Shaheen Bagh, Jafrabad and Khureji were called to the spot through social media. By 6am, one carriageway of Asaf Ali Road was blocked.The arterial road remains busy with goods vehicles heading to the markets in the Walled City, especially after midnight. Anticipating the crowd to swell further, additional commissioner (central) Mandeep Singh Randhawa asked police to start checking vehicles carrying people and stop them from reaching Turkman Gate. The vehicles were diverted from Delhi Gate or Chaman Lal Marg.By daybreak, police issued an ultimatum to the organisers to shift the protest elsewhere before the peak hours began. While some left, a few dozen stayed back and had to be evicted forcefully.Around 7pm, the protesters again started gathering in the lanes behind Turkman Gate, but police blocked the entry and exit. Religious leaders were again roped in to convince the protesters to remain within the barricaded area.Meanwhile, videos of the incident, which went viral on social media, showed protesters being removed from the site trying to provoke the policemen into a confrontation. Police said efforts were being made to identify them. A probe has been initiated against a woman captured on camera misbehaving with policemen. The woman and her group have been spotted at different protest sites masquerading as DU, Jamia or JNU students. The SIT probing the anti-CAA riots has been asked to probe their background.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73310202,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-151760,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-police-nipped-protest-at-turkman-gate-in-the-bud/articleshow/73310204.cms

146,['17/01/2020'],Tamil writer speaking on CAA cut short at book fair,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Chennai: A section of litterateurs and some in the audience have accused the organisers of the Chennai Book Fair of asking writer Arumugam Tamilan to end his speech on Wednesday night for making references to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The organisers, Booksellers and Publishers Association of South India (BAPASI), denied the charge and said he was cut short because he had exceeded the time limit.

BAPASI president R S Shanmugham said the police had given permission to keep the fair open only till 9 pm and Tamilan was still speaking around 9.05-9.10 pm. So he was asked to wrap up.

But this didn’t cut ice with critics. “I don’t know whether the organisers have prepared any list on what is to be spoken. The idea is to suppress those who question the establishment. This is a dangerous trend,” said Tamil poet Manushyaputhiran.

Book fairs are open platforms where all ideas are discussed without any censorship, he said. “If the organisers don’t want such talks, then they should prepare a list of what they want immediately. Otherwise, they should come up with an explanation for their misdeeds like why these people are prevented while expressing their ideas in the open. If we can’t talk about CAA and NRC, then we can’t talk about demonetization as well,” he said.

Filmmaker Amshan Kumar said such restrictions and interferences are unfair, particularly when it comes to a book fair where ideas are expressed freely. “It’s happening quite often, and I consider this a very dangerous one. Writers are meant to speak about the issues around them. They should never be stopped. What happened at the book fair was ridiculous,” said Amshan Kumar.

Young Tamil poet Sukritharani said such attacks are against the secular fabric of society. “I was not there when this incident took place. It’s unfortunate. I heard about it later and it’s unfortunate,” she said.

Chief minister V Narayanaswamy

PUDUCHERRY: Chief minister V Narayanasamy challenged lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi to prove land grabbing charges levelled against him and his son by a Congress MLA N Danavelu , who was suspended from the party on Thursday, and declared that he will resign if the charges are proved.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, he questioned whether Bedi will resign and quit public life if the charges against him and his son cannot be proved. Narayanasamy termed Bedi’s decision to issue a press statement on Danavelu’s baseless oral allegations of land grabbing without any concrete evidence against him and his son as derogatory. He declared that her action proved that she does not have any administrative abilities.

“When you receive a written complaint of corrupt practices with concrete evidence against someone, you must first review the complaint and ascertain whether there is any ground for the allegation and then refer the issue to the police or the CBI. She (Bedi) issued a press note based on Danavelu’s baseless open allegations without any evidence against me and my son. This reveals the animosity she has towards me. I am openly challenging Bedi to prove the charges and I will resign. Will she resign and quit public life if the charges cannot be proved?” Narayanasamy questioned.

He said anyone can level corruption charges against anybody, but they must produce concrete evidence to prove their charges. “People know Danavelu’s past and his activities before,” he said.

Narayanasamy lambasted Bedi charging that she does not have the ability or quality to serve as lieutenant governor. “She does not have any qualification to be a lieutenant governor. Chief minister is a constitutional authority. She insults chief minister and ministers to attain instant publicity,” he said.

He said he had served as the secretary of All India Congress Committee for 14 years, as a member of parliament for 23 years, Union minister of state for 10 years and is currently serving as the chief minister for the past three and half years and declared that he could not have been a part of Manmohan Singh-led cabinet in the UPA1 and UPA2 governments in the Centre if he was involved in corrupt practices.

“I served as Union minister with CBI under my direct purview. If I had indulged in corrupt practices, I would not have been a part of Manmohan Singh-led cabinet in the Centre and I would not have been in the good books of our leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi,” he said.

He accused All India NR Congress and BJP parties besides Danavelu of encouraging and instigating Bedi to act against the elected government.

The revenue inspectors were provided smart hand-held devices

AGRA: To increase revenue recovery and bring transparency in collection of house tax, Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) administration on Thursday launched android based tax collection system.

The revenue inspectors were provided smart handheld devices. Connected to the civic body’s central server, these devices will allow revenue inspectors to issue receipt to the property owners. Besides, the central server will also send message of receiving payment on the customer’s registered mobile number.

According to Mayor Naveen Jain, the new tax collection system will leave no scope for any malpractices in the tax collection process. A hundred android based handheld devices have been provided to the AMC by Axis bank as part of the corporate social responsibility.

Mayor Naveen Jain said, “Digitalization of records of 3.10 lakh properties in the city’s 100 wards has been completed. The digital records have been uploaded on the AMC website. After paying tax, the property owners will be able to crosscheck it online. AMC is first in UP to implement the smart tax collection system.”

For the current financial year 2019-20, the municipal board has set a target of collecting Rs 60 crore house tax. So far, only Rs 26 crore has been collected. AMC officials hope that the android collection system will help in achieving the target by March 31.

According to AMC records, out of the 3.10 lakh properties registered with the civic body, only 10 percent property owners have no dues pending. Around 10,000 property owners have not paid any tax for the past five years. Recently, AMC administration has issued notices to these property owners to clear their outstanding dues.

KOCHI: Admission supervisory and fee regulatory committee (ASC) failed in fixing an appropriate fee for MBBS courses in self-financing colleges, the high court said in a judgment.

A division bench comprising Justice A M Shaffique and Justice T V Anilkumar considered 17 petitions filed by college managements, alleging that the ASC failed to consider the fee fixation afresh even though the high court had set aside the committee’s order last year and remanded the matter back for fresh consideration. Fee fixed for 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2018-19 were considered in last year’s judgment. Now, the ASC has confirmed the earlier view taken by it, which was already set aside by the high court, the managements alleged. The ASC ignored the documents submitted and fixed a fee that had no connection with the actual expenditure, the managements contended.

The court said a perusal of the ASC’s order does not reveal any application of mind. As per the 2019 judgment and Section 11 of Kerala Medical Education (Regulation and Control of Admission to Private Medical Educational Institutions) Act, the fee fixed should be reasonable and should consider various parameters such as location of the college, nature of the course, cost of land and building, administration and maintenance expenses, and reasonable surplus for growth and development. But no such consideration is found in the ASC’s order, the court said.

Finding that the ASC had failed to comply with the order to consider the matter afresh in its proper perspective, the court said there is no clarity in the committee’s order and there was re-determination of fee by the committee. When the Act itself gives an indication as to how the fee has to be determined, the committee is obliged to fix the fee in accordance with the statutory provisions, the court said. The committee had thoroughly failed in fixation of fee, the court said.

Kozhikode: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that India’s position in the world order was rising and added that Indian thought has the potential to solve some of the most leading challenges faced by the planet.

Inaugurating the three-day international conclave on ‘Globalizing Indian Thought’ organized by the Indian Institute of Management-Kozhikode ( IIM-K ) through video conferencing on Thursday, Modi said that Indian way of conflict avoidance is not by brute force but by the power of dialogue.

“It would make everyone proud that being rooted to Indian systems and traditions, the country is surging ahead on the path of development. You can see it in the manner in which India has achieved remarkable financial inclusion and how we have rolled out the largest healthcare programme in the world. No wonder India’s position in the world order is rising. Indian thought has given a lot to the world and has the potential to contribute even more,” he added.

Elaborating on the various strands of Indian thought that has been the hallmark of country’s culture and contributed much to the world, Modi said that the ideas of compassion, harmony, justice, service and openness were central to Indian values.

“Our civilization has prospered when many could not. Why? Because one finds peace and harmony here,” Modi said.

Stating that many of the health practices which have now become popular worldwide, including yoga, have their roots in India, Modi called upon the IIM community to devote time to yoga.

He said that India’s belief in peace and harmony also included harmony with mother nature and environment and traces of that belief can be found in the leadership role performed by the country in forming the international solar alliance and efforts to increase use of renewable energy.

Highlighting the respect and importance accorded to women in Indian culture, Modi said that even while most Western countries took decades to give voting rights to women, the makers of the country’s Constitution ensured women had voting rights from the very first day.

Modi said that innovation came naturally for India as it had a culture of openness and respect for different opinions.

“The innovative zeal of Indians is drawing the world to India. We are a nation with a vibrant young population. Our demographic dividend makes us a magnet for investment,” he added.

He also digitally unveiled a statue of Swami Vivekananda in front of the MDC Complex at the function.

Spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, in his keynote address, said that scientific temper was embedded deeply in Indian thought. He said that India can give a sense of belongingness to the world through its culture, wisdom and rich traditional knowledge.

President of Indian Council of Cultural Relations (ICCR) and MP, Vinay Sahasrabuddhe and IIM-K director Debashis Chatterjee spoke. Grammy Award winner Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt staged a musical performance after the session.

Fr Kuriakose Mundadanof

KOCHI: Fr Kuriakose Mundadan of the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese has come out with a veiled attack against the stand taken by the Syro-Malabar Synod against Love Jihad while criticizing the Church for not having a formal stand on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ).

Fr Mundadan’s reaction was in his column ‘Varikalkidayil’ on the Sathyadeepam, a Church run weekly, set to hit stands on January 22. As per a clipping of the weekly, which completed printing the priest in the article titled, ‘Paurathva Bhedagathiyum Love Jihadum Kooticherkaamo? (Can Citizenship Amendment and Love Jihad be intertwined?)’, states that it is common sense to not make statements belittling any particular religion when the entire country is burning due to politics of religion.

“Since, the dangerous CAA would negatively affect the diversity and democracy of India, political parties and religions took a clear stand on it. But was the stand of the Catholic Church clear? This question is important as there was no clear stand on the issue from the Catholic Church in Kerala,” the article reads.

It states that unlike the strong worded opposition of Latin Catholic Church in Kerala and Archbishop Soosa Pakiam, the statement by the Syro Malabar Synod headed by Cardinal Alencherry, who is also KCBC president, was just an advice to the central government. The priest states, commenting on the Synod’s statement that the central government should resolve the confusions and apprehensions around CAA.

“Laity in the state is asking about the present state of the Catholic Church in Kerala which comes under Pope Francis who is known for his strong stand for secularism,” the priest writes.

The priest points out the lack of evidence in allegations of Love Jihad. “Has anyone taken the number of men and women who have converted to Christianity in the name of love?” he asks in the article. Fr Mundadan told TOI that priests have the right to express their opinion and the article was his take on the issue.

Sonia Gandhi (L); Tejashwi Yadav(R)

NEW DELHI: Congress is likely to enter into a pre-poll alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) for the Delhi assembly elections on February 8. RJD may take five-six seats while Congress will fight for the rest, a source said. The two parties already have a tie-up in Bihar and Jharkhand.

The central election committee of Congress was busy in a closed-door meeting till late Thursday evening to finalise its candidates and the announcement of the alliance is likely to be made on Friday.

Earlier in the day, RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha met senior Congress functionaries and handed over the list of seats and candidates. He told a news agency that RJD was entering the fray to fulfil the role of a Poorvanchali party. “Our relations with Congress go a long way back. So, we started talks with them and the talks have been positive,” he said. Indicating that a deal may be sealed within the next 24 hours, Jha said while RJD had demanded seven — 10% — seats, it was “ready to contest on five-six seats”.

The seats chosen by RJD include Burari, Karawal Nagar and Timarpur in north-east Delhi, Kirari in north-west, and Uttam Nagar and Palam in west Delhi, all with a significant percentage of voters from Poorvanchal, a term that loosely refers to migrants from eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

A senior Congress functionary claimed that the impact of the alliance would be felt in several other seats with Poorvanchali voters. The RJD candidates may also contest on the Congress’ election symbol, a source said. To woo the Poorvanchali voters, Congress recently appointed Kirti Azad as the chairman of its campaign committee.

In the recently held Jharkhand assembly elections, the two parties went into an alliance with Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and they have come to power. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, too, they had an alliance. In Bihar, RJD had contested on 20 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats while Congress got nine.

CM V Narayanswami

Puducherry: The Union home ministry has requested the Puducherry government to inform whether it had obtained the mandatory clearance from the Centre for the visit of chief minister V Narayanasamy and others to Singapore in November last year.

Deputy commandant (home) Ravi Ranjan in a letter to chief secretary Ashwani Kumar said the ministry has examined the Puducherry government's letter dated December 13 last year on the visit of Narayanasamy and others to Singapore.

""Government of Union Territory of Puducherry is requested to inform whether mandatory FCRA (The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act) clearance had been obtained or otherwise,"" Ranjan said.

He also advised the Puducherry government to adhere to the Centre's direction of intimating the ministry in advance on the foreign trips of the chief minister, his cabinet colleagues and other elected members through the lieutenant governor.

""Government of Union Territory of Puducherry is also advised to take action as per Cabinet Secretariat's O.M. dated May 6, 2015, in future, with prior intimation to this ministry through LG Puducherry,"" Ranjan said.

Lieutenant governor’s secretariat thanked the Centre for addressing the long-standing violation frequently committed (by the chief minister, ministers and elected members). Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi pointed out that there are two sets of rules for foreign travels – one for the public officials and the other for the elected members occupying responsible positions in the administration.

Bedi accused Narayanasamy, his cabinet colleague M O H F Shahjahan and DMK MLA R Siva of visiting Singapore in November last year without obtaining the mandatory clearance from the Centre. She said the anomaly was raised in the governors’ conference held recently and expressed gratitude that the issue was ‘addressed and settled with urgency for the larger public good’.

“The office of the Lt Governor thanks the GOI, MHA for settling this long-standing violation which was being frequently committed,” she said.

Bedi pointed out that the issue related to the Singapore visit of Narayanasamy and others has not been ‘finally settled as statutory clearance under FCRA was not obtained’ by the team led by the chief minister.

She insisted that members of the cabinet and others must obtain all prior clearances mandated before taking up foreign trips.

Bedi accused a minister of travelling frequently to a country without intimating the chief secretary and lieutenant governor’s secretariat and obtaining prior clearance from the Centre. She also accused a few others (ministers and elected members) of visiting ‘sensitive countries without any record with the administration’.

“All this now comes under due regulation and watch,” she said.

Narayanasamy had denied the charges and claimed that he and others obtained due clearance from the authorities concerned before visiting Singapore. He claimed that he informed the Prime Minister’s office about the visit and the Union external affairs ministry also accorded political clearance for the visit.

CHANDRAPUR: Close on the heels of excise department’s suggestion to lift liquor ban in Chandrapur district owing to “revenue loss”, state minister for relief and rehabilitation and Chandrapur guardian minister, Vijay Wadettiwar , on Thursday said that a committee will be soon formed to evaluate the success of prohibition. “Based on its report the state government would take a call on lifting prohibition in the district,” said Wadettiwar.

Wadettiwar, who was on his maiden visit to Chandrapur after becoming a cabinet minister, talked about the positive and negative impacts of liquor ban and said that time has come to evaluate its outcome.

The excise department’s suggestion had come up at a review meeting of various department called by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar recently. Wadettiwar claimed he was not present at the meeting but stated that if it’s established that prohibition has proved successful in Chandrapur, “then there is no question of revoking the ban”.

Leader of anti-liquor activists, Paromita Goswami, termed the statements and developments as a “conspiracy to create an atmosphere against prohibition”. Addressing media on Thursday, she tore into claims of revenue loss due to prohibition and reasons being put forth to lift the ban.

“The claims of excise department officials about losing revenue of Rs200 crore per month or Rs2,400 crore per year due to prohibition in Chandrapur district is a blatant lie,” she said while claiming that the department’s total revenue target itself is between Rs15,000 and 17,000 crore.

Wadettiwar had in the past lashed out at the failure of liquor ban in Chandrapur and demanded it to be evaluated. While campaigning for assembly election, he had spoken need of projecting Tadoba as an international tourist destination. Liquor is one of the main attractions for tourists, he had said while stressing that national and international visitors need to be offered what they like when they come to Chandrapur.

Many people’s representatives have opposed the liquor ban. Chandrapur MP Balu Dhanorkar is a strong supporter of lifting the ban. During the Lok Sabha election campaign, his opponent BJP’s Hansraj Ahir termed its as fight between ‘Milkman Vs Liquor baron’.

Independent MLA from Chandrapur, Kishor Jorgewar, too has sought rethink on prohibition. His rival and former BJP MLA Nana Shamkule had registered his opposition to the study panel that had recommended liquor ban back in 2012-13.

Goswami claimed that Congress and NCP leaders have made lifting liquor ban their top priority since Loksabha election. “Soon after coming to power, they started taking steps to life the ban. They don’t talk about the outcome of liquor ban in Wardha and Gadchiroli districts, because those were implemented during their regime,” she said.

She declared that any move to lift prohibition will be strongly opposed. “I am not against the review committee. If it carries out fair and impartial evaluation, I am optimistic about a positive outcome,” she said.

She said that there is no revenue loss due to the ban. “Excise on liquor is taken at the source of production (liquor factory) and none of the liquor producers have claimed reduction in production due to prohibition in Chandrapur,” she said.

The activist also claimed that the loss is only Rs5 crore which was revenue from liquor licence renewal in the district, she claimed.

Chandrashekhar Azad

NEW DELHI: Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad , who has been externed from the city for the next four weeks by a court as a part of a bail agreement, will be visiting Jama Masjid on Friday. The same day, he will attend a media conference and then head to the Valmiki temple at RK Ashram Marg before leaving for his hometown in Saharanpur.

Azad had sought special permission from the court for the visits. Bhim Army media coordinator Kush said that Azad would be visiting the Jama Masjid between 11am and 12 noon. “If possible, he will also visit the Ravidass Temple in Govindpuri,” Kush added.

However, police sources said that Azad’s itiniary had not been shared with them till Thursday late night. A team of policemen would escort him and videograph all his movements until he reaches his hometown. He would not be allowed to address a crowd at any of these places.

Cops expect a large crowd to follow Azad during his visits and have made adequate arrangements.

Azad was earlier arrested from the Jama Masjid after a wild-goose chase through the day during which he kept hoodwinking the police. He was charged under sections of rioting and arson after a protest at the Delhi Gate suddenly turned violent after Azad’s speech at the Jama Masjid.

He was bailed out on Wednesday after he approached the court citing health issues.

Nitin Raut

NAGPUR: Guardian minister Nitin Raut on Thursday said that he wants to build the tallest statue of Lord Buddha in the city. This will attract international Buddhist tourists here, he feels.

Raut also announced that he would build a Buddhist-themed park near Futala. The project was proposed in 2003 during the tercentenary celebrations of the city, but never materialized.

The minister said that the city had a lot of tourism potential due to its proximity to tiger reserves and association with Dr BR Ambedkar. “If we develop Gorewada zoo and some places of interest related to Ambedkar and Buddha and combine it with wildlife tourism, Nagpur can become a big tourist hub. Most of the international tourists in India are from Buddhist countries,” he added, while addressing a ‘Meet the Press’ event at Patrakar Club.

He further said that Zero Mile would also be beautified to attract tourists. “In fact, I want to develop an Ambedkar corridor in the state. All the places which had some association with him would be linked,” he added.

Raut could not clearly explain the astronomical grid support charge (GSC) proposed by MSEDCL on solar rooftop consumers. Media persons pointed out to him that on one hand, the energy department was promoting solar energy, and on the other hand making it expensive for consumers. Raut said that he would comment on it after holding a meeting of discom officials on Friday.

The minister said that MSEDCL was installing solar agricultural pumps on a priority basis. “We have installed thousands of pumps, and many more would be supplied to farmers in the coming months. It is wrong to say that we are against solar power,” he asserted.

On the appointment of private experts by the previous government in the energy department, Raut said that they had been asked to resign, failing which their services would be terminated. “My department will see a lot of cleansing in the coming days,” he added.

On failing to curb crime rate in the city, Raut said that minister of state for home Satej Patil had convened a meeting of city police officers and told them to take concrete steps to reduce crime, otherwise they would have to face the music.

New directions

ALLAHABAD: In his first administrative decision after taking over, Allahabad University’s (AU) new officiating VC RR Tewari granted relief to 12 students leaders who had been suspended or rusticated during the tenure of his predecessor RL Hangloo. On Thursday, Tewari ordered that the suspended students can appear for their examinations and complete the course.

The list of suspended students included former AU Students Union president Rohit Mishra

The errant students were either suspended, blacklisted or rusticated from the university over their alleged involvement in various protests Hangloo or the university administration.

“These 12 students can now enter the campus and appear in their exams,” said AU chief proctor Ram Sevak Dubey.

In another important decision, the VC appointed Shailendra Mishra from the anthropology department as the new public relations officer of AU.

Ravi Singh, one of the senior-most class C employees of AU, was again appointed as the personal assistant to the VC. Singh was also Hangloo’s PA and the AU registrar, but was later transferred to the office of dean of arts and commerce— a move which was considered to be far below his capability and seniority. Singh took charge on Thursday.

Tewari also said that AU would function for five days a week, albeit teachers who feel that they have to take extra classes to complete the syllbus are free to teach on Saturdays and Sundays as well.

“The offices would remain open for five days only, but because of the delay due to recent disturbances, the head of the departments would ensure that the syllabi is completed in the spring semester (January-June 2020) within time. Teachers can take classes on Saturdays and Sundays as well,” said Tewari.

HYDERABAD: Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy on Thursday pulled up railway officials and Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel after he found the door frame metal detector at Secunderabad railway station to be defunct.

Kishan Reddy was at the Secunderabad station to catch a train to a municipality as part of BJP municipal elections campaign .

Kishan Reddy was on his way to Bellampalli, Narsapur, Godavarikhani and Ramagundam municipalities.

SCR principal chief security commissioner GM Eswara Rao told TOI, “The door frame metal detector is supposed to beep when a passenger walks in with a metal item. It was not working when minister Kishan Reddy came to the station due to a technical issue. We have replaced it. We have also asked for more door frame metal detectors.”

Secunderabad railway station handles around 1.25 lakh passengers during festive season.

“We will be deploying additional forces from Railway Protection Special Force (RPSF). Currently, the RPF is short-staffed. We have sought 780 new personnel for RPF and they are undergoing training. There will soon be greater security at the railway stations and platforms. To temporarily sort out the problem, we are roping in special forces,” said Eswara Rao.

A member of an anti-terror cop squad said, “Secunderabad was on Lashkar-e-Toiba’s hit list. During Sankranti , there is huge rush of passengers. RPF and Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel shall ensure the safety and security of passengers.”

Indore: The future is here. Manholes of Swachh Indore will now be cleaned by robots. After Hyderabad, now Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) is planning to introduce robotic manhole cleaning machine to eliminate human intervention in cleaning of manholes in city.

Corporation officials said that 10 robotic de-silting machines will be deployed in one of wards in city on trial.

“We are in talks with a Kerala-based firm that has developed this robotic machine for cleaning manholes. The agency has proposed to deploy around 10 robotic cleaning machines in city on trial. If found feasible, the initiative would be implemented across city,” IMC commissioner Asheesh Singh told TOI.

He said that though IMC already have super sucker machines for cleaning sewer lines and chambers, sometimes they require manual intervention as these machines are not that equipped to perform the work.

“Deploying these robotic machines can be a helpful solution to do away with manual intervention,” said Singh.

The commissioner said that they are in talks with a private group to fund this project under corporate social responsibility. “We have proposed the firm to bear 90 per cent cost of this project and remaining 10 per cent would be borne by IMC,” he said.

This robotic machine, estimated cost of which is around Rs30lakh, collects, lifts and shifts waste from a manhole, doing away with the need of manual intervention in cleaning of sewer lines and blockages in manholes.

Officials associated with the firm said that this robotic de-silting machine is equipped with four CCTVs to monitor cleaning work.

It comes with two units including a stationary unit attached with a user interface at the top and a robotic device at the bottom that goes inside manhole and performs the cleaning work. “The entire operation can be controlled and monitored from control panel, and the operator does not have to go inside the manhole,” said Rashid K, an official with the firm while speaking to TOI.

“This machine can also detect toxic gases like hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methane, sulfur dioxide for safety of the operator,” he added.

There are over 1.77 lakh manholes in city that are maintained by IMC.

KOCHI: Allan Shuhaib and Thwaha Fazal , the youths from Kozhikode who were arrested for alleged Maoist links, were produced at NIA court in Kochi on Thursday and remanded in judicial custody.

The duo told reporters at the court premises that they were not Maoists but active CPM workers and demanded chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to present evidence for their alleged link with Maoist groups.

The youths were arrested under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) on November 1, 2019.

“We are members of the CPM. We are not Maoists. We used to campaign for the party, seeking votes. We were booth agents during the last election. The chief minister should reveal where we had planted the bombs or who we killed,” Alan and Thwaha shouted at reporters while coming out from the NIA court.

The case pertains to the Kerala police registering a case against three youths who were found under suspicious circumstances in the Peruman Perummal area of Kozhikode around 6.45pm on November 1. One among them ran away when police approached them. Police later claimed that they recovered posters and leaflets having links with Maoist groups from the accused persons.

NIA re-registered the FIR and took over the probe on December 18, 2019. It was re-registered under Section 20 (any person who is a member of a terrorist gang or a terrorist organisation), Section 38 (offence related to membership of a terrorist organisation) and Section 39 (offence related to support given to a terrorist organisation) of UAPA.

On Thursday, they were brought from the jail in Kozhikode where they had been lodged since their arrest and produced before the NIA court in Kochi.

Meanwhile, NIA filed a petition seeking seven days of custody of the accused persons from January 20 onwards which was opposed by the counsels for both the accused. The court which decided to hear of custody petition and the objection raised by counsels of accused on Friday, remanded the accused to the high-security prison in Thrissur.

Thwaha filed a petition seeking dental treatment, including permission to undergo a root-canal procedure.

NIA prosecutor submitted before the court that the treatment should be provided in the presence of a police officer and the court ordered to provide the necessary treatment at Thrissur Medical College.

NAGPUR: Work on the project started in May 2016 and many works are still incomplete. Mayor Sandip Joshi , who held a meeting to review its progress on Thursday, said people were troubled by the chaotic traffic and increasing accidents at the site. The meeting was convened following a request from east Nagpur MLA Krishna Khopde.

Khopde, deputy mayor Manisha Kothe, municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar, corporators Abhay Gotekar, Rajkumar Solekar, NHAI’s deputy general manager Samay Nikose were among those present.

Municipal commissioner too expressed concern over slow progress of work. He pointed out NMC had completed the land acquisition and had extended all support for expediting the work. He said NHAI had done nothing for flyover’s speedy completion. It had not even penalized the contractor carrying out the work, Bangar said.

Nikose responded that the NHAI had set new extended March 2020 deadline for the contractor to complete the work. Bangar asked how would the work be done in two months given its current status.

Even construction of roads beneath the flyover was going on at a snail’s pace, Solekar told TOI. He drew attention towards incomplete road work between HB Estate and Octroi naka on Pardi road. As a result, many accidents happen there, he said. Joshi told TOI that an extended meeting with all concerned officials from NHAI, NMC and traffic police on Pardi flyover construction will be convened soon.

Meanwhile, NMC’s electricity department is framing a policy to curb the menace of TV cables criss-crossing the streets and being fastened to street lights. Deputy mayor Kothe on Thursday held a meeting and directed NMC’s legal and electrical departments to frame a policy that should restrict cable operators from misusing street light poles. Kothe also directed the electrical department to hold a meeting of cable operators in the city to end the menace.

Rotary Bangalore IT corridor organizers of Pet-a-thon , Dog lovers participate with their pets at Cubbon Park ... Read More

NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is bringing in a policy wherein a pet lover cannot keep more than two dogs, said mayor Sandip Joshi.

He was replying to the residents of Vijay Cooperative Housing Society, Sonegaon, who told him how a resident was feeding almost 15 dogs at her house in their locality. The residents were speaking to him during the first day of mayor’s Janta Darbar that kicked off from Laxmi Nagar zone.

Joshi’s first Janta Darbar received more than 60 complaints. He directed assistant municipal commissioner (Laxmi Nagar zone) Raju Bhivgade to address all grievances at the earliest. Most of the complaints pertained to irregular sweeping of roads, choking of sewer lines, encroachments, bad roads, stray cattle and dog menace etc.

Residents told the mayor that they cannot venture out any time during the day due to stray dog menace. Despite complaints to the NMC’s veterinary department and even to local corporator Lahukumar Baheti, no action was taken. “Now, a woman feeds almost 15 stray dogs and they chase every resident in the locality,” they claimed.

Joshi told them that the NMC is framing a policy which will restrict any pet lover not to keep more than two dogs. He said soon, a proposal in this regard will be tabled before the general body meeting and will be implemented.

Bajaj Nagar residents also pointed out about dog excrement on pavements, especially in front of entrance gates of many houses and public grounds and parks. They also stressed the need to restart penalizing dog owners who fail to clean the poop of their canines. Residents also expressed concern over cattle straying in playground and roads.

Despite the mandatory rule of having dog licence by paying just Rs200 per annum, only 121 citizens have licences to keep canines. The NMC even used to penalize pet owners for dog excrement on pavements or roads. But due to casual approach of the NMC’s veterinary department, the move is not being implemented.

Venkatesh Nagar residents exposed NMC’s failure to address accumulation of water and garbage in Sanchayani premises near Khamla Square. “Despite high court’s directive and contempt, the NMC has done nothing,” said Satish Vaidya, a resident of Venkatesh Nagar, adding that the entire premises has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes due to accumulation of water and garbage.

Joshi said the NMC had prepared an estimate to fill the basement and ground floor of the building. For the purpose, it needed around Rs 3.50 crore. “So, we have decided to fill it with the help of public participation,” he said.

To a complaint from residents, Joshi threatened MSEDCL’s Congress Nagar division to sit on a hunger strike in front of their office if they failed to cover meter board at Rambagh Complex Apartment Association in Ramkrishna Nagar, Khamla. January 24 is the deadline to address the issue, he said.

Devakar Varshe, a resident of Sneh Nagar, pointed out about the substandard work while constructing community hall in a playground in their locality. “Constructed a couple of years ago with funds sanctioned by former CM Devendra Fadnavis, walls and ceiling of the hall developed cracks,” he claimed. Joshi asked Bhivgade to visit the spot and submit a report.

PUDUCHERRY: Puducherry Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) has suspended MLA N Danavelu from the party for anti-party activities, PPCC president A Namassivayam said. Danavelu had levelled corruption charges against chief minister V Narayanasamy, his son and health minister Malladi Krishna Rao.

Speaking to reporters in the presence of Narayanasamy at the party office on Thursday, Namassivayam said the local unit brought the anti-party activities of Danavelu to the notice of All India Congress Committee, which issued an instruction to suspend anyone including ministers or elected members or party cadres indulging in anti-party activities.

“We have suspended MLA Danavelu from the party based on the instructions of the AICC. We will issue a show-cause notice to him seeking his explanation within seven days. A disciplinary committee formed by the party high command will take a final call after reviewing the reply furnished by Danavelu,” Namassivayam said.

Namassivayam pointed out that Narayanasamy and Congress leaders reached out to Danavelu on several occasions to discuss the issues raised by him. “Chief minister invited him and held discussions on several occasions. But he continues to indulge in anti-party activities. He is not participating in the party affairs for the past two and half years. He does not respond to phone calls or letters from the party office. The issues concerning the party must be discussed within the party, but he went to the media making wild allegations,” said PPCC president.

Namassivayam accused Danavelu of approaching an independent MLA from Mahe and attempting to broker a deal to topple the Congress government with the help of opposition parties. He said the opposition All India NR Congress (AINRC) and the BJP have been instigating Danavelu to act against the Congress government.

Danavelu told media that neither PPCC president nor the chief minister can suspend him from the party.

""Puducherry Congress leaders do not have the right to initiate disciplinary action against me. Only Sonia Gandhi or Rahu Gandhi can initiate action against me. I have raised serious corruption charges but neither the chief minister nor the ministers invited me for any discussion. Chief minister and ministers deny the charges and claim that the charges are false. They are wrong. They are attempting to misguide. I will expose their corrupt practices,"" said Danavelu.

Meanwhile, AIADMK legislative party leader A Anbalagan demanded the Congress government to convene the assembly to prove its majority in the House by holding trust vote. He insisted Narayanasamy take moral responsibility after he and his son were charged with corrupt practices by an elected member and resign.

In the 30-member assembly, the ruling Congress has 14 (after the suspension of Danavelu) The party has the support of its ally DMK (three) and an independent candidate. On the opposition side, AINRC has seven and AIADMK four. There are three BJP leaders nominated as members to the legislative assembly.

AHMEDABAD: More than 50 drones will keep an eye on the wild ass population in the state. After a successful experiment, the forest department has decided to use the technology for the Wild Ass census next month.

The wild ass census will cover an area of more than 5,500 sq km, including 4,000 sq km of the Little Rann of Kutch. The census will be cover Kutch, Patan, Morbi, Banaskantha, Surendranagar and Ahmedabad districts.

The December 2014 census had returned a count of 4,451 animals, a 413 increase from 2009, when 4,038 wild asses had been counted.

Senior officials in Gandhinagar said the department decided to carry out an experiment and a drone was sent into the Little Rann of Kutch.

On spotting a herd of wild ass, the drone was lowered to about 100m. “We realised that there were four such groups in various fields and the drone was further lowered for a clear picture. At a height of 50m, we noticed movement and could a call to all the animals then flocked to the main held. Finally, all the 99 wild asses grouped together. Officials in the field took several videos and still photographs. It emerged that all the animals could easily be counted using such photographs.”

“After this experiment, the department decided to use drones for the census this year, especially in areas unreachable by humans,” said principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Shyamal Tikadar. Another forest official said the census will employ two methods, the first will be drones and the second the conventional method, where wildlife experts will count wild asses.

The first census of wild asses was conducted in 1940, when 3,500 wild asses were found. By 1960, this figure fell to just 362. The species was then classified as ‘highly endangered’. In 1973 and 1976, the Rann of Kutch and adjoining districts were taken up as the area for conservation of the wild ass. He said the forest department began conducting the census since 1976.

The census will adopt the block counting method. About 20 zones and 100-odd sub-zones will be formed in an area covering the entire wild ass range.

AHMEDABAD: More than 50 drones will keep an eye on the wild ass population in the state. After a successful experiment, the forest department has decided to use the technology for the Wild Ass census next month.

The wild ass census will cover an area of more than 5,500 sq km, including 4,000 sq km of the Little Rann of Kutch. The census will be cover Kutch, Patan, Morbi, Banaskantha, Surendranagar and Ahmedabad districts.

The December 2014 census had returned a count of 4,451 animals, a 413 increase from 2009, when 4,038 wild asses had been counted.

Senior officials in Gandhinagar said the department decided to carry out an experiment and a drone was sent into the Little Rann of Kutch.

On spotting a herd of wild ass, the drone was lowered to about 100m. “We realised that there were four such groups in various fields and the drone was further lowered for a clear picture. At a height of 50m, we noticed movement and could a call to all the animals then flocked to the main held. Finally, all the 99 wild asses grouped together. Officials in the field took several videos and still photographs. It emerged that all the animals could easily be counted using such photographs.”

“After this experiment, the department decided to use drones for the census this year, especially in areas unreachable by humans,” said principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Shyamal Tikadar.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Adequate rainfall coupled with decent prices have brightened the prospects of cumin (jeera) farmers in Gujarat. The acreage sown with cumin in the state has increased by 44% and output is likely to rise by 25% in 2020.

Data compiled by the Gujarat government’s director of agriculture shows that cumin acreage has increased by 1.41 lakh hectares (ha) to 4.87 lakh hectares by the end of the January 13, against 3.45 lakh hectares at the point of 2019. The total cumin acreage for the entire rabi season last year was 3.82 lakh ha.

Greater availability of water following a good monsoon and farmers getting good price for their produce last year are the factors responsible for the increase in cumin cultivation.

“Gujarat saw less cumin production last year, which helped farmers get good prices for their produce. This year the monsoon was good. As a result, the area under cumin cultivation has increased,” said Ashwin Nayak, chairman, Federation of Indian Spice Stakeholders (FISS).

Lower production projections had kept cumin prices between Rs 2,700 to Rs 3,400 per 20kg throughout 2019. Prices are still firm between Rs 2,700 and Rs 3,200 per 20kg depending on quality.

“With the higher acreage, Gujarat is expected to produce 25% more cumin than last year. A lot depends on the weather over the next couple of months. If weather changes unexpectedly, it could hurt the crop,” Nayak added.

The new crop is expected to begin arriving at market yards from March end or early April, as sowing was delayed this year, market players say.

According FISS, cumin production in Gujarat in 2019 was low, at 1.67 lakh metric tonnes, compared to 1.71 lakh metric tonnes in 2018.AHMEDABAD

183,['17/01/2020'],What areas in Sec’bad need better traffic monitoring?,"This story is from January 17, 2020

With Rachakonda police roping in volunteers to help ease the traffic in Sec’bad, TOI asked readers which areas were facing traffic issues -

Traffic monitoring is the need of the hour from Bolarum to Tirumulgherry and beyond. Roads in various parts of the city are in shambles. Areas such as Bolarum, Alwal, Lothkunta, Tirumulgherry and Vasavi Nagar need better roads. Roads in various areas have bottlenecks thanks to encroachments by shopkeepers, bus stops and illegal parking lots. Not even a single traffic signal is manned properly. The traffic police should study the busy stretches and understand the requirements of each junction. Widening can be a temporary solution but not a complete answer. Traffic islands, traffic signals and manual availability of police personnel at all times is the best possible way out to overcome traffic issues - Deepesh Surana

As many of the important roads are not wide enough, traffic snarls are a common sight even during non-peak hours. However, the busiest roads in Secunderabad such as Paradise junction and Patny junction need special attention. In these areas traffic comes to a grinding halt in the absence of adequate police personnel to regulate traffic from dawn to dusk. For easy flow of traffic, law-enforcing agency should not only strictly prohibit parking on either side of the road but also see that no cart-vendor is allowed to occupy part of the road and transact business. Police must also caution RTC drivers against rolling stops and stopping in the middle of the roads. Home guards must be pressed into service and posted on all busy roads to assist police personnel in smooth movement of traffic - Srinivasan Ramaswamy

Areas such as Lal Bazar junction , Lothkunta junction, Alwal require better traffic management. Several areas such as Uppal, Hubsigua, ECIL 'X' roads, West Marredpally main road, Shenoy Hospital road, old Bowenpally petrol bunk, Hasmathpet road experience regular traffic snarls and this must be looked into - CH Simhadri

The involvement of traffic volunteers is a very good initiative by Rachakonda traffic police. We as citizens must also be a part of this initiative and learn traffic rules and regulations. We must also follow these rules and help those around us do the same - Raja Shekhar Mettu

It is a good idea to rope in traffic volunteers. Those who do not follow the traffic rules must be made volunteers. Authorities must get rid of long meridians that is causing traffic woes in various parts of the city - K Mohan

Aditi Bhatt

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand’s Aditi Bhatt won gold and bronze medals at the All India Junior Ranking Tournament 2020 that was held in Chandigarh.

Second seeds Bhatt and her partner from Kannada, Tanya Hemanth, defeated Uttar Pradesh’s Shruti Mishra and Shailja Shukla 21-11 and 21-9 in the final of the girl’s doubles event.

The triumph in the finals helped the duo to clinch gold medal. In the singles event, Bhatt lost the semi-final to Uttar Pradesh’s Mansi Singh 18-21 and 16-21, which earned her a bronze medal.

The national championship was held in Chandigarh from January 10 to January 14.

Speaking about her success, Bhatt told TOI Thursday, “The finals was not that tough, as we managed to beat them quite comfortably. But, the quarter-finals against the Telangana pair was extremely tough. But I am quite happy that we won because it was the first time I was paired with Tanya Hemanth. Now, the other selection tournament is in Bengaluru, where my objective will be to secure a gold medal in the singles event too,” said Bhatt.

Bahadur Singh Mankoti, secretary of the Uttarakhand State Badminton Association (USBA), credited Bhatt’s mother for her victory.

“She has been a U-17 national champion and even won gold in U-19 all India competition. Her future is very bright as she is giving consistent performances. We are quite sure that she will play soon in major international tournaments. Recently, she performed well in the national as well as international tournaments. The Credit for her consistent performance goes to her mother as she always travels with her for tournaments,” Mankoti said.

Aditi Bhatt’s mother Poonam Bhatt hoped that her daughter replicates her performance in the Bengaluru event.

“I have been devoting my time with Aditi for the last 8 to 10 years. This was one of the two selection tournament. The other one will start next week in Bengaluru. Based on the performance in both these tournaments, players will be selected for international tournaments in Netherlands and Germany. Top 4 players of different categories will be selected and Aditi has very good chances of getting selected,” said Poonam Bhatt.

185,['17/01/2020'],Dehradun: AYUSH students threatens protest if colleges fail to refund hiked fees,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Trivendra Rawat

DEHRADUN: Even after the chief minister’s directive two months ago and the high court’s order last year, many private AYUSH colleges in the state are yet to refund the hiked fees of over 6,000 students. Irked, the students have now decided to launch their protest again if the state government does not intervene in the matter immediately.

“We had written several reminders to the university and to the government, but no action was taken against the colleges makes, which makes the government’s intentions very clear towards AYUSH students . We are left with no option than to re-start our agitation, as the examinations are fast approaching and the colleges are forcing students to pay the hiked fees to get themselves registered,” president of AYUSH student’s medical association, Faizal Siddique said.

Notably, chief minister, Trivendra Rawat in November last year had assured that the state government would ensure compliance of the orders of High Court which has asked the Ayurvedic colleges to return the hiked fees to all the students within a month’s time. The CM had also announced to make a fee fixation committee which would be headed by a HC judge.

The decision of ensuring the compliance of HC’s order was taken in the emergency meeting called by the chief minister which was attended by Ayush Minister Harak Singh Rawat, Ayush secretary Dilip Jawalkar and authorities of Ayurvedic University.

The colleges had hiked the fees to Rs 2.5 to Rs 3 lakhs, which was just Rs 80,000 earlier. The students had approached high court last year and even the court maintained that the fee hike was unreasonably high and ordered the colleges to return the fees.

187,['17/01/2020'],Nagpur: Five times increase in hacking cases in two years,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: Artist Bijayananda Biswal, a noted painter who was even mentioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a speech, is the latest victim of hackers. They managed to take over his social networking account which had images of most of his creations over the years. The former railway employee said he was stunned to find out he could no longer access his award winning art works online, or interact with his thousands of followers.

A Right to information (RTI) Act query recently underlined how hacking cases have increased from 21 in 2017 to over 100 last year. It makes for a 79% jump from 57 in 2018 to 100 the following year.

The rise in hacking leaves behind the increase in cases of cyber frauds. In 2019, there was an increase of 77% in online cheating cases, which rose from 1,349 in 2018 to 2,377 in the following year. Apart from hacking, there was also a rise in crimes related to social media, from 573 in 2019 to 393 in 2018.

DCP, cyber crime , Shweta Khedkar said cases of hacking have increased but police are also trying to detect cases and nab offenders as fast as possible. “Websites and social media accounts must be secured with anti-virus applications like firewalls and other protections. Accounts and websites must not be vulnerable to cyber attacks easily,” she said.

“We have managed to crack cases and zero down on culprits too, like in the case of a private bank, but users should practice caution in the first place,” said the DCP. She added that one of the reasons hackers operate is the lure of earning easy and fast money. Some hackers are also driven by psychological aberrations or even criminal designs, like revenge or extortion.

Advocate Mahendra Limaye, an IT expert, said hacking has not been specifically mentioned in the amended IT Act, but is described as illegal access to a computer, system or network. “Hacking or such illegal access can land one in prison for three years and fine up to Rs3 lakh, if proved,” said Limaye.

“One of the plausible reasons behind the rise in hacking may be the increase in the drive to collect more information. One must be careful regarding using unprotected systems or connecting one’s system in public places. Using free Wi-Fi and such facilities at public places is not advisable as unknown systems and networks get access to one’s personal systems,” he said. “Auto-logins and saving passwords at random is also an easy invitation to hackers,” said the IT expert.

Limaye also said that the institution imparting training in ethical hacking should also make their students aware that such practices can lead to legal problems if done with criminal intent.

To avoid being stuck at Ashram, two-wheelers are illegally passing through Okhla Bird Sanctuary

NEW DELHI: How bad can traffic jams be? Shivani Jain, who lives in Sarita Vihar in south-east Delhi , was forced to shift to Noida to avoid the daily jams on Mathura Road. With the shorter, and the relatively freer Kalindi Kunj road closed due to an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest, Jain shifted to her mother’s house because she could not afford her children missing school.

“Nursery and KG students are stuck in traffic jams for hours,” exclaimed Jain, recalling how the school bus brought her son home around 4pm instead of 2pm.

Thursday was 33rd day of the protest by the women of Shaheen Bagh . While gathering nationwide attention and sympathy, they have blocked Road 13A, which links the Sarita Vihar underpass and Mathura Road with Kalindi Kunj, leaving office goers, students and health services in a quandary. Slum dwellers near Jasola Vihar who work as maids in south Delhi localities, have also been impacted.

On Thursday afternoon, TOI found seven ambulances stuck in the traffic going towards Ashram. Hospitals in the affected area include Holy Family, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute and Apollo Indraprastha, besides other smaller establishments. Ambulance driver B. Paswan at Holy Family conceded that the protesters allowed vehicles carrying patients to pass through, but barred the empty ones. “What if we receive an emergency call when stuck in a jam?” Paswan asked.

Even patients are inconvenienced. At Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, doctors told TOI of patients caught in traffic. “In emergency cases, these delays can prove disastrous,” said a doctor. At Fortis Escorts, the doctors revealed how in the initial few days of the protest, many patients, especially from outside Delhi, failed to arrive for scheduled appointments fearing violence.

The routine of students going and coming from schools has been disrupted too. Anita Sahani, who lives in Sarita Vihar’s L Pocket, was especially harassed because the school timings of her two children are different. “The school bus does not come and for a month now I have had to either wait at the school or make two journeys via the clogged raid,” said Sahani glumly.

To avoid being stuck at Ashram, two-wheelers now use the road inside the Okhla bird sanctuary. Such unauthorised entry can lead to jail stay and fine, but Mahesh Yadav, a delivery executive, pleaded helplessness. “Delivery to Noida or Faridabad will be much delayed. Instead of 10-15 minutes, I sometimes take 1-2 hours to cover short distances,” he said.

Mohammad Aman, who runs a construction and demolition business, said that though he supported the protest, the government should now coax the protesters to shift. Like him, most residents of Sarita Vihar, Jasola Vihar and Sukhdev Vihar side with the protesters, but sheer necessity has prompted them to seek a change of the sit-in site. On Sunday, a large crowd in Sarita Vihar asked for the barricades at Shaheen Bagh to be removed.

On Thursday evening, the area ACP addressed the protesters, asking them to allow traffic movement on the Kalindi Kunj road since it was affecting business in the area. The cops even offered the protesters an alternate space where they could continue the protest.

NAGPUR: A 35-year-old man surrendered before Wadi police on late Wednesday night after allegedly bludgeoning his live-in partner to death a few hours earlier at their house in Ambedkar Nagar. Wadi police have arrested the accused, Sidharth Sonpiple, and booked him for murder under sections 302 and 201 of Indian Penal Code (IPC).

He was produced before the court on Thursday and remanded in police custody for a day.

Police said Sidharth, a labourer, and his partner Alka were living together since the last three months. The couple was separated from their husband and wife. They used to regularly get into fights as Sidharth suspected that Alka’ was in a relationship with some other person/s. Alka regularly went out at night and came back in the morning, which used to bother Sidharth.

On Tuesday night, the duo had dinner and got into a fight after Alka said that she is going out. Alka went out and came back at around 5am on Wednesday.

On Wednesday afternoon, the duo again got into a fight after Sidharth asked Alka where she had been the entire night. When Alka’s answer failed to satisfy Sidharth, the accused got angry, picked up an iron rod (khalbatta) and started hitting her.

Alka sustained injuries on her head and stomach. Sidharth got frightened and left her in a pool of blood. He locked the house and went outside. After roaming for several hours, he approached Wadi police station at around 10.30pm and confessed to the crime.

Police soon rushed to the spot and sent her body to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) where the post mortem was conducted. Cops later arrested Sidharth.

DEHRADUN: Disappointed with the poor garbage management of the civic body in terms of segregation of waste, several resident groups have taken it upon themselves to segregate the daily waste they generate in their respective localities.

One such group, Eco Group in Kewal Vihar, has around 150 families that are segregating their waste and making compost out of wet waste.

The group members say they ensure segregation and composting of around 100kg waste daily. The practice has given employment to women from economically backward sections, as the group gives them unused or waste cloth material, which they turn into cloth carry bags.

""On weekends, we also conduct awareness drives in other localities of Dehradun. Different programmes are being planned for different localities. For instance, in slums, we ask children to separate plastic from daily waste and hand it over to us, as we want to make sure that minimum plastic goes to the landfill in Shishambara,” said Ashish Garg, member, Eco Group.

Another group, Eco Campus Drive that began in 2017, is catering to around 800 people living in the campus of the Indian Institute of Petroleum. They started with awareness drives and later proceeded to door-to-door garbage collection. More than 70kg waste is segregated and composted by them daily, the group members claim.

“Our campus is spread over more than 750 acres. Wet waste is composted in pits across the campus. We try to recycle the dry waste, and send the non-recyclable part to the municipal corporation. We have a plastic-to-diesel converter that produces 800 litre diesel from around 1 tonne of plastic waste. We have seven active members and our aim is to make our campus zero-waste,” said Suman Jain, coordinator, Eco Campus Drive.

Residents of Siddhartha Paradise in Panditwari, have also started a group, with 500 residents practicing complete segregation of 80kg of waste they produce daily, since October last year.

“We have six active members. Apart from waste management, we conduct awareness drives especially for maids, as they are the best bet for segregating household waste. A vehicle of the NGO Waste Warriors comes every 10 days to collect the dry waste, while bio-medical waste is collected by NGO Medical Pollution Control Committee every three days. We compost 65% of the wet waste in over 30 drums installed at various spots of the colony. The rest goes to the municipal corporation,” said Narendra Singh Rawat, member, Siddhartha Paradise RWA.

194,['17/01/2020'],Nagpur: Cutting trees is last option for any project said Nitin Gadkari,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Nitin Gadkari

NAGPUR: In news that could assuage ruffled environmentalists, Union surface transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari has assured citizens to give his complete support to conservation of trees and environment.

Speaking exclusively to TOI, the two-time city MP said cutting trees “has always been the last option for any project”. Gadkari was speaking a day after the civic authorities decided to drop plans to construct a road through a thriving bio-diversity in Bharat Nagar area of the city which is owned by the Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PDKV).

Calling himself an environment lover, Gadkari said, “Whenever I think of development, the prime focus is on ensuring that progress and environment protection go hand-in-hand. I am very alert towards such issues and I assure the citizens to give my complete support.”

Affirming that not a single tree would be cut at the urban mini-forest rechristened as ‘Bharat Van’, Gadkari said, “Many citizens came to meet me and, after various discussions, we decided to find a middle way. Our aim was to come up with a solution which doesn’t damage the trees in Bharat Van. Today, I am delighted that not a single tree will have to be cut for this road project. ”

As reported by TOI earlier, hundreds of environmentally conscious citizens including residents of Bharat Nagar, green activists, children, doctors, senior citizens and members of various civil society groups came together on April 3 last year to meet Gadkari, raising their voice against “environment foeticide” which was set to destroy Bharat Van.

TOI was the first to report about the proposed road which was a part of the nearby Telangkhedi Lake redevelopment project. In Gadkari’s own words, the facelift for the lake by constructing a musical fountain and an elevated viewing gallery has been his “dream project”. This paper had also highlighted how more than 500 age-old trees and a rich biodiversity habitat are threatened by the development plans.

Welcoming the minister’s stance, environment activists in the city stressed that the next focus should be on conserving the Telangkhedi lake. “We are grateful that the minister took a decision keeping in mind the concerns of citizens. Though Bharat Van is now safe, the 220-year-old lake is on the verge of dying. It is full of garbage, silt and water hyacinth due to which its dissolved oxygen levels are dropping. Even if the musical fountains and other activities start, the lake will die within a few years,” said Jaydeep Das, honorary wildlife warden of Nagpur.

Based on TOI’s reports, Das had written a letter to the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court highlighting the adverse impacts of the proposed road. HC had treated his letter as a suo motu public interest litigation on December 3, 2018.

Meanwhile, MahaMetro, which is the executing agency of the project, has stated that dropping the road was a joint decision of itself, Nagpur Municipal Corporation and Public Works Department (PWD). “Metro had no central role in policy-planning of this project. The plan for constructing the road was submitted as per directives from PWD, which is handling the planning and financing of the entire project,” the agency stated. It added that changes at any level were communicated to MahaMetro by PWD.

NAGPUR: In a shocking revelation, Nagpur University’s (NU) vice-chancellor SP Kane admitted that the administration failed to spread awareness about refund of revaluation scheme since the last three years, which led to not a single student applying for it. He, however, assured that anyone applying for refund after clearing their subjects in the last three years will be given their dues.

“We started the refund scheme in 2016-17, but haven’t received even a single application. It’s correct that we haven’t created awareness about it. Now, we’ve decided to take bank account details of students along with IFSC code so that their refund could directly be deposited into their accounts,” Kane told TOI, adding that he aims to make the system completely cashless.

With a view to fulfil long-pending demands of various students’ organizations like ABVP, NSUI, MNS and NCP among others, the VC on October 23, 2016, announced to refund the revaluation fees of Rs150/paper if the student cleared the subject. TOI had reported his major announcement which he had termed as one of his dream projects in detail next day.

A recent RTI query by Abhay Kolarkar disclosed that NU collected over Rs3.30 crore from revaluation fees of students in the last three years. In reply to the activist’s questions, NU’s assistant registrar Manoj Joshi said the number of students applying for revaluation had jumped from 20,458 in 2016 examination to 45,500 in 2019 summer exams.

Explaining the rise in figures, the VC said it was due to increase in the number of exams due to introduction of semester pattern. On being pointed out that the new pattern was introduced about three years ago, Kane, who’s tenure is coming to an end on April 7, said that in 2016-17, only BSc courses were offered in the semester system while BCom, BA and other courses were added in later years.

“In the last three years mentioned in the RTI query, six exams were conducted as per semester patten. There’s no question of raising doubts on the evaluators. Unlike common perception, we don’t like receiving revaluation applications from the students. It would be a golden day in the university’s history when there wouldn’t be even a single applicant,” Kane said.

The VC said he had already asked director of students’ welfare (DSW) to issue a notification for refund of revaluation fees and inform all the conducted and affiliated colleges to paste that on their notice boards so that the students would come to know about it.

“Even now, the students can apply on plain paper if they cleared the subject after revaluation. We’re also exploring option of online application,” he added.

DEHRADUN: Amid sloganeering and bursting of crackers, Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal announced the name of six-time MLA from Kaladhungi Bansidhar Bhagat as the new Uttarakhand BJP president on Thursday.

Meghwal made the announcement after getting feedback from a BJP panel which also included CM Trivendra Singh Rawat. “There was only one name that we discussed and in keeping with the traditions of our party, Bhagat’s name was cleared unopposed for the state president post,” said the Union minister.

Sources said that the names of candidates who were said to be in the fray such as Kailash Pant, Suresh Joshi and Naveen Dumka were not discussed and Bhagat was elected unopposed by the party.

Meanwhile, former Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who was expected to attend the announcement, couldn't make it to Doon.

Addressing the media after his anoinment, Bhagat said, “I am thankful to the party for giving me this responsibility and my priority is to prepare for the 2022 assembly elections by strengthening the party at the booth level.”

Bhagat further said, “The state president’s role is important to coordinate with the state government and boost the morale of the party cadre for different campaigns.” After taking over the reins, the new president also held a meeting with the office-bearers of the state unit at the party office in Dehradun. According to BJP insiders, Bhagat would be setting up his team for the state level in the coming weeks, followed by a whirlwind tour of all 70 constituencies in the hill state.

Senior leaders such as Union HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Nainital MP Ajay Bhatt, state cabinet minister Dhan Singh Rawat, and others also reached the party office to congratulate Bhagat.

Speaking to mediapersons, Nishank hailed Bhagat as his contemporary who has deep knowledge of booth-level management and party’s organisation functioning. “I am fully confident that his skills in managing the organisation and immense experience as a legislator would strengthen the BJP in Uttarakhand,” he said.

Outgoing state president Ajay Bhatt said, “Bhagat has a great organisational experience and has a deep connection with party workers across the state.”

Police have seized the ultrasound machine and are preparing to lodge a case against the owners

JHANSI: A diagnostic centre in Jhansi which conducted sex determination test was caught red-handed on Wednesday. Authorities have seized the ultrasound machine and are preparing to lodge a case against the owners.

As per the details, a team from Gwalior headed by deputy collector Deepshikha Bhagat, along with nayab tehsildar Vandana Yadav, visited the diagnostic centre after receiving regular inputs that women from Madhya Pradesh were sent here for illegal sex determination of their unborn children.

During initial investigations, they had rounded up an Anganwadi female worker Aruna Yadav, who used to act as a mediator.

The team got in touch with the local authorities after reaching here. Nayab tehsildar herself, as a decoy customer, contacted a native broker Shubhash Yadav and clinched a deal of Rs 10,000 for conducting the test. The broker took the decoy customer to Jai Matadi Ultrasound Centre situated opposite to Jhansi Medical College where they met with one Ram Naresh Patel.

During the negotiation, other team members also arrived along with Jhansi authorities—ACM Vanya Singh and nodal head (Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques) Dr Mahendra Kumar—and caught them red-handed.

As per city magistrate Salil Kumar Patel, the centre is registered in the name of Dr ML Verma who was not present during the raid.

The test was being conducted by Ram Naresh Patel, an arts graduate, whereas, Subhash and Aruna worked as brokers. During interrogation, Aruna revealed that in the past, she had brought three more people for the test and charged Rs 10,000 each from them.

“We have seized the ultrasound machine, along with a tracker machine, computer harddisk and a few registers. We are preparing to lodge a case under Section 28 of PCPNDT Act in consultation with the APO,” said the city magistrate.

200,['17/01/2020'],Sebi clears nine current and former NSE executives,"This story is from January 17, 2020

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi has given clean chit to nine people, including Ravi Narain, former MD of NSE, in a case in which it was alleged that a host of NSE officials had colluded to favour a handful of brokers to make illegal gains using the NSE’s optical fibre network that connected it to its derivatives trading server. Popularly called the NSE’s co-location or co-lo case, there were several allegations of wrongdoing on Narain and other ex-NSE officials including R Nandakumar , senior VP (operations), Jagdish Joshi, co-lo head, and N Muralidharan and Ravi Apte, chief technology officers (CTOs).

A host of serving NSE officials was also named in the case and have been exonerated. They are Mayur Sindhwad, chief operating officer (Trading), Sankarson Banerjee , CTO-Projects, G Shenoy, CTO-Operations and Suprabhat Lala, VP-Regulations.

Sebi in its order said that none of the nine officials was occupying a post of director and/or a key managerial position at NSE during the relevant period, which was between April and July, 2015. “The materials available on record also don’t indicate even remotely, the role of any of the noticees as an employee of NSE in facilitating Sampark Inftainment to establish the (optical fibre) connectivity at NSE,” the regulator said in its order.

In this high-profile case it was alleged that exchange officials had allowed a non-registered service provider, Sampark Infotainment, to lay optic fibre network connectivity between the exchange’s trading room and the servers of a select brokers in such a way that these brokers enjoyed faster speed of trading over all other brokers. In the exchange trading business where very sophisticated computers that use complex algorithms to take advantage of price discrepancies within micro-seconds, such advantages could result into huge profits. The case relates to the allegations of wrongdoing between 2013 and 2015.

It was also alleged that NSE these nine officials did not act in a fair and equitable manner in their dealing with the brokers. A further allegation was that NSE had amended its rules in an opaque manner to allow Sampark Infotainment to provide network services from within its premises despite the company not being registered with it. Sebi didn’t find any evidence in this matter too to proceed against these officials.

Kanpur: At least 55 passengers had a providential escape when a UPSRTC bus overshot a broken railing on Lower Ram Ganga canal and its rear portion hung precariously over a canal in Rasoolabad area of Kanpur Dehat late Tuesday night.

The bus, which was from Bulandshahr depot, was going to Delhi from Kanpur.

This is the third incident in the state involving a bus in last one week.

Police said the incident took place after the bus driver, Mohan Singh, lost control while giving passage to a truck coming from opposite direction on Rasoolabad-Bilhaur road.

The bus came to a halt after the driver applied the brake but by then the rear portion was hanging in the air. While many passengers moved cautiously towards the front side and got down safely, others rushed out through emergency exit. Some others jumped off the vehicle through the windows.

Police and transport officials reached the spot and pulled out the bus to safety with the help of JCB and cranes. Circle officer, Rasoolabad, Ram Sharan Singh said: “All the bus passengers are safe. Passengers said the bus was within speed limit but driver lost control while trying to avoid collision with the truck. A major tragedy was averted.” Eyewitnesses said had the bus not come to a halt, it could have plunged into the canal, resulting in casualties.

On January 13, At least two persons were killed and 16 others left injured when a UPSRTC bus travelling in dense fog on Agra-Lucknow expressway fell into a ditch.

Earlier on January 10, at least 20 passengers travelling in a private sleeper bus were charred to death in Kannauj district after the bus collided head on with a truck carrying some inflammable material.

The accident took place on the GT Road stretch of Delhi-Kanpur highway when the bus was going to Jaipur from Gursahaiganj in Kannauj.

NEW DELHI: Matiala assembly constituency has the highest number of electors, so whoever wants to capture that seat needs to appeal to a wide range — from middle- and upper-class voters in Dwarka’s urban setting to the economically lower sections in the over 20 rural communities. The candidate also has to pass muster with the cynical section among voters — the 18-19 year olds, who number the highest here among all assembly seats.In the relatively well-developed localities, issues like 24/7 supply of water and electricity, more green spaces and pothole-free roads are key concerns. Jaswinder Kaur, a resident of Dwarka’s Sector 10, said her power and water bills had come down since 2015, giving her no reason to vote for a change. “I’m happy with the work that is happening in our area. If development continues, why should people complain?” asked Kaur.Surya Prakash, a Sector 11 resident, remarked that with the profusion of housing societies in Dwarka, guaranteed supply of water and electricity was important to voters. “We’ve seen improvements in water and electricity. Not only has there been a reduction in bills, but there are fewer power outages,” said Prakash.The sub-city, however, is not likely to be the deciding factor in an electoral victory because a bigger chunk of voters live in urban and rural villages. Adjacent to Dwarka is Kakrola, a village that is still pushing for development. Its residents look enviously at Dwarka’s posher sectors for ideal infrastructure and development. “People want to see improvements in our area too. Of course, slowly but surely, they are taking place. The progress in government schools is tremendous,” said Rekha Bhatt, a Kakrola housewife.Deeper in the constituency in villages like Ghumanhera, Chhawla and Rewla Khanpur, the landscape changes dramatically. The urban sprawl of Dwarka is replaced by open mustard fields. And the electoral issues too are completely different: employment, sanitation and transport connectivity with the rest of the city.Farmer Bharat Singh sits outside his house in Rewla Khanpur, enjoying the winter sun. The yellow spread of his mustard field is a heartening sight, but he rues the lack of economic opportunities for youngsters. “Working in fields is not lucrative, so it doesn’t tempt the new generation, least of all those who are educated,” said Singh. He said they were inclined to find urban jobs, but pointed out reaching the city was a task for them.The constituency is currently represented by Aam Aadmi Party’s Gulab Singh Yadav, who won comfortably in 2015, leaving BJP’s Rajesh Gahlot and Congress’ Sumesh Shokeen in his wake.AAP government’s attempts to provide better healthcare and education, according to village voters, are appreciated because they did not have easy access to hospitals or medicines in the past.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73317871,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-132181,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/citys-biggest-segment-may-not-be-easy-to-call/articleshow/73310443.cms

The administration barricaded the area and started restoration work

UTTARKASHI: A newly constructed concrete security wall of All Weather Road Project collapsed due to rainfall in Chinyalisaur region of Uttarkashi district on Tuesday. The winter rain which damaged the retaining wall, which is built in hills to prevent soil erosion, has also narrowed the width of the Gangotri National highway, which is now posing threat for residents and tourists.

While local residents and activists raised questions over the quality and technical irregularities in the construction of PM Narendra Modi’s pet project, the Uttarkashi district magistrate said that an investigation has been set up to ascertain what went wrong.

District magistrate Ashish Chauhan said that the administration is doing every bit to ensure safety of the people and smooth functioning of the project. “We are not sure how the incident took place but we have set up an inquiry to ascertain who is at fault. The guilty will not be spared. The road is also being repaired at the earliest,” he said.

Sources said that around a 100-metre-long safety wall was recently constructed under the ongoing All Weather Road project on Gangotri National Highway near Raj Rajeshwari temple of Chinyalisaur region. However, a 50-m stretch of the wall collapsed after a recent spell of rainfall. Soon after the incident, the administration barricaded the area and started restoration work.

Uttarkashi-based activist Shoorveer Singh said, “It is surprising that a massive project like this couldn’t even withstand winter rainfall. The climatic conditions of the region are harsher during monsoons, how will the Centre government’s dream project survive then?”

He added that the incident has exposed the carelessness of the government agencies in implementing the project, for which the government is spending a lot.

A local resident also raised questions on the quality and technical irregularities on the construction work. He said, “Due to shoddy work done by some people, lives of several others are now at risk. After barricading, the road has further narrowed down. The government should take immediate action against careless officers to ensure quality of the project.”

DEHRADUN: Six people were killed after the car they were travelling in plunged into a 200-metre-deep gorge near Saknidhar on Rishikesh-Badrinath National Highway in Tehri district on Thursday morning.

The car carrying six passengers, including three women, two men and a girl child, was going towards Rudraprayag from Rishikesh when the accident took place before Devprayag around 10am, said a police officer.

“All six people inside the car were family members. Prima facie, the person behind the wheels lost control over the vehicle resulting into the accident. However, exact cause of the accident would be ascertained after investigation,” said Mahipal Rawat, in charge of Devprayag police station.

On receiving information, local police along with State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) reached the accident spot and launched search and rescue operation.

DEHRADUN: Chief Wildlife Warden of Uttarakhand Rajiv Bhartari on Wednesday gave orders to either capture or kill the leopard, which allegedly dug out a corpse from a graveyard in Haridwar and fed on it.

Notably, the same leopard had on October 26 last year attacked a man near Sector-4 of BHEL area. This year, on January 4 and January 10, the big cat had claimed two other lives near Subhash Nagar and Sector- 5 of BHEL area, respectively.

The incident has led to panic among locals, who want the forest department to cull the leopard immediately, even though the officials and scientists have outright denied the possibility of a big cat scavenging for corpses.

“It is just not possible for a leopard to dig out a body and scavenge simply because it doesn’t have any mechanism to dig out the soil. Though this could have been done by a hyena or other carnivore scavenger which is found in Haridwar area in Rajaji reserve,” said Y V Jhala, senior scientist, Wildlife Institute of India.

Meanwhile, the forest department has sent a team for inspection.

“There were pug marks; however, our analysis shows that it may belong to another animal. Also, the ground inspection revealed the presence of a civet in that area, not of a wild cat, as is being rumoured. These are speculations, which everyone should refrain from,” said Haridwar DFO Akash Verma.

Verma said seven cages have been installed in sensitive areas, which include Western Foundry Gate of BHEL, Sector 3 (BHEL), Sector 4 (BHEL), Sector 5 (BHEL) and Ranipur Road.

“Now, shooters from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand are being contacted to either capture or kill the big cat,” he said.

Social activist Medha Patkar addresses a protest against CAA/NRC at Delhi University's North Campus

NEW DELHI: Social activist Medha Patkar , at an event held at Delhi University on Thursday, said that NRC and NPR meant National Resistance to Communalism and National People’s Resistance, respectively. She applauded the students and youth for leading the movement against the Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

“Now, the government is scared of you as you are fighting on the principles of the Constitution. What is happening in the country is not about one law. Now, it has transformed into people’s resistance. So NPR is actually National People’s Resistance and NRC National Resistance to Communalism,” said Patkar. She reiterated that documents should not be shown when officials come for collecting NPR data.

At the event held by “Gandhi Calling” organisation, Tushar Gandhi, lawyer Karuna Nundy and others also addressed the students who had gathered in large numbers at the arts faculty. Mahatma Gandhi’s great grandson Tushar Gandhi told the students that they should be ready to sacrifice in this fight. “Now, you cannot stop. This is the second fight for freedom and in the process you have to give a lot of sacrifices,” said Gandhi.

Lawyer Karuna Nundy explained the legal provisions of CAA/NRC/NPR and said the fight should go on till the act is repealed. “NPR, as being claimed, is not just like another census. For the first time, they are going to ask where your parents were born and if you are a citizen of the country. Also CAA does not mean that citizenship for Hindus will be fast-tracked,” said Nundy who later read the Preamble, along with the students.

NEW DELHI: Matiala assembly constituency has the highest number of electors, so whoever wants to capture that seat needs to appeal to a wide range — from middle- and upper-class voters in Dwarka’s urban setting to the economically lower sections in the over 20 rural communities. The candidate also has to pass muster with the cynical section among voters — the 18-19 year olds, who number the highest here among all assembly seats.In the relatively well-developed localities, issues like 24/7 supply of water and electricity, more green spaces and pothole-free roads are key concerns. Jaswinder Kaur, a resident of Dwarka’s Sector 10, said her power and water bills had come down since 2015, giving her no reason to vote for a change. “I’m happy with the work that is happening in our area. If development continues, why should people complain?” asked Kaur.Surya Prakash, a Sector 11 resident, remarked that with the profusion of housing societies in Dwarka, guaranteed supply of water and electricity was important to voters. “We’ve seen improvements in water and electricity. Not only has there been a reduction in bills, but there are fewer power outages,” said Prakash.The sub-city, however, is not likely to be the deciding factor in an electoral victory because a bigger chunk of voters live in urban and rural villages. Adjacent to Dwarka is Kakrola, a village that is still pushing for development. Its residents look enviously at Dwarka’s posher sectors for ideal infrastructure and development. “People want to see improvements in our area too. Of course, slowly but surely, they are taking place. The progress in government schools is tremendous,” said Rekha Bhatt, a Kakrola housewife.Deeper in the constituency in villages like Ghumanhera, Chhawla and Rewla Khanpur, the landscape changes dramatically. The urban sprawl of Dwarka is replaced by open mustard fields. And the electoral issues too are completely different: employment, sanitation and transport connectivity with the rest of the city.Farmer Bharat Singh sits outside his house in Rewla Khanpur, enjoying the winter sun. The yellow spread of his mustard field is a heartening sight, but he rues the lack of economic opportunities for youngsters. “Working in fields is not lucrative, so it doesn’t tempt the new generation, least of all those who are educated,” said Singh. He said they were inclined to find urban jobs, but pointed out reaching the city was a task for them.The constituency is currently represented by Aam Aadmi Party’s Gulab Singh Yadav, who won comfortably in 2015, leaving BJP’s Rajesh Gahlot and Congress’ Sumesh Shokeen in his wake.AAP government’s attempts to provide better healthcare and education, according to village voters, are appreciated because they did not have easy access to hospitals or medicines in the past.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73317871,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-132181,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/citys-biggest-segment-may-not-be-easy-to-call/articleshow/73318321.cms
212,['17/01/2020'],"NSI develops Natural Sugarcane Spread for use in place of jams, jellies","This story is from January 17, 2020

Kanpur: National Sugar Institute (NSI) has successfully developed 'Natural Sugarcane Spread' which can be used in place of commercially available jams and jellies. From 100 kg of sugarcane, about 15-16 kg of ‘Natural Sugarcane Spread’ can be produced. Also, it is economically viable as the product will cost Rs 27-28 per kg only.

This feat could be achieved after two years of continuous efforts. The sugar technology division of NSI has developed this product that can be made in different flavors.

Detailing about the product, director, NSI, Prof. Narendra Mohan, said that the product made is natural in which no chemical is used for juice clarification and preservation.

“The basic process involves dual filtration, including a high degree of filtration using membrane filters, clarification of cane juice using vegetable mucilage’s and skimmed milk etc. About 80-85% of the water present in the juice is removed by carrying out evaporation at reduced pressure. Thus, the product is natural and besides sucrose, contains carbohydrates, vitamins, glucose, fructose, proteins, fats and minerals originally present in cane juice with no added sugar”, Prof Mohan explained.

He said Natural Sugar Spread can be made in various flavors--chocolate, ginger, cardamom, mint and lemon, using natural extracts depending upon the consumer choice and preferences.

“It can thus be termed as a real natural nutritious health product also. Even without adding any preservative, the shelf life of the product is estimated to be one year which can be extended further by adopting superior packaging techniques”, the NSI director informed.

As regards economics, from 100 kg of sugarcane, about 15-16 kgs of ‘Natural Sugarcane Spread’ can be produced and thus considering the present sugarcane prices, the estimated cost of the product will be about Rs. 27-28 per kg only, he added.

Keeping in view the surplus sugar production which has kept the sugar prices depressed and looking to the growing market of such natural and chemical-free products, this can be a value-added product for the Indian sugar factories, Prof Mohan added.

The institute has already received preliminary inquiries for technical know-how from many firms, he said.

He further said that the National Sugar Institute is committed to developing value-added products in sugar factories so as to enhance its revenue pot for achieving economic sustainability.

Keeping this in view and to train the sugar factory personnel, the institute earlier established a ‘Special Sugar Division’ and is now in the process of setting up a 10 tons per day refined sugar unit.

Police said the man, Bharat Diwakar, was a local SP leader and used to take contract of fishing in Barua dam. On Tuesday night he had gone to attend a function along with his wife Namita at his parental village Dahini, but both went missing mysteriously.

When the matter was reported to the police, they interrogated their driver Ramsewak Nishad, who also worked in Diwakar’s fisheries. Spilling the beans, Ramsewak told police that Diwakar had killed Namita on Tuesday night and took her body to the dam to dispose it. Ramsewak said he helped Diwakar stuff the woman’s body in a sack and tied it with a bolder so that it drowned.

They took the body in the middle of the dam in a boat to dump, but the boat capsized. While Ramsewak swam to safety, Diwakar drowned, claimed police.

After a hectic search, SDRF recovered the body of Namita on Thursday, while Diwakar is still untraceable. Police have also recovered the abandoned SUV of Diwakar parked near the dam along with the slippers of the woman.

SP Chitrakoot Ankit Mittal said a case has been lodged against Diwakar under Section 302 of IPC at Bharatkoop police station on the application of Namita’s parents while Ramsewak is being interrogated to confirm his role in the crime.

“We are trying to recover Diwakar’s body and gather more facts. We have sent the body of the woman for postmortem examination to find out the cause of the death. We are also examining the role of Ramsewak after which any action will be taken,” he added.

AURANGABAD: Hundreds of employees of a large private sector firm and their supporters on Thursday took out a morcha to the divisional commissionerate demanding the government to make the company pay their dues which have been pending since the past year.

“Our hunger strike has completed 150 days; still the authorities have not intervened. To draw their attention, we took out a morcha to the divisional commissioner’s office,” said their legal advisor Abhay Taksal.

Employees’ union president Gajanan Khandare and Taksal alleged that the authorities have deliberately ignored their hunger strike. “The morcha today was meant to draw attention of the people toward the injustice meted out to the 340 workers, who have resorted to strike in front of the office of the deputy commissioner of labour,” they said.

Earlier, they said the workers resorted to ‘bheek mango’ (seeking alms) agitation and sent Rs 721 to the company owners. The workers have also sent a memorandum to the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on December 12, 2019, but to no avail, Khandare and Taksal said.

They said they had sought time of the chief minister during his recent visit to the city to voice their grievances. But they did not get an appointment. They said that the government should consider their situation.

KOTTAYAM: The heads of the Orthodox Church have said that the Ordinance promulgated by Kerala government regarding the burial of bodies at the Christian cemeteries would not stand legal scrutiny and will create complications.

Addressing a press conference on Thursday, they said that though the chief minister said that it was being promulgated in the aftermath of the disputes between the Orthodox and Jacobite Churches, after it came out, it has proved to have implications for all Church denominations.

They alleged that the Ordinance is a ploy by the government to circumvent the contempt of court petition filed by the Orthodox Church in the Supreme Court which alleged that court granted rights are not enforced by the government. The Church also expressed its eagerness to know the views of other Christian denominations on the issue.

They said that crystal clear definitions have not been given to several clauses of the Ordinance. The first clause says if a parishioner dies he is qualified to be buried in the cemetery of the church belonging to his parish where his ancestors were buried. However, no definition has been given as to who is an ancestor. “It hasn’t clearly said an ancestor pertains up to which generations? It has not been clearly said who is the authority to establish that one belongs to particular parish and his ancestors were buried in the cemetery of that parish,” said the leaders.

Yuhanon Mar Dioscoros Metropolitan, Orthodox Church spokesperson Johns Abraham Konat and MOSC association secretary advocate Biju Oommen were present at the press conference.

Usha Gupta (inset) was waiting for her husband in the car when the men spotted her

NEW DELHI: Police have solved the murder case of an elderly woman, who was shot dead in her car near Patparganj, with the arrest of two robbers from outer Delhi.

The accused — Mohmmad Mazhar and Mohammad Kamrul — who were involved in a spate of robberies in Narela Industrial Area, told cops after their arrest that they had murdered the woman in a bid to snatch her phone and gold chain on September 21, last year.

Mazhar and Kamrul were caught from their residence in Usmanpur. During questioning, Mazhar said that Kamrul was his brother-in-law. Cops are also looking for their third associate. Kamrul was arrested several times earlier also for stalking college students and women at bus stops.

DCP (outer-north) Gaurav Sharma said that efforts to track down the robbers were intensified after they were found using black bikes during the robberies. During questioning Mazhar told cops that both he and Kamrul were fascinated with the new model of the motorbike and would target two-wheeler riders on empty stretches and rob their bikes.

On September 21, they spotted Usha Gupta sitting in her car and decided to rob her. Mazhar parked the bike behind the car and walked up to the driver’s side and started hitting at the car window to break it. When Gupta tried to drive away, Mazhar chased her and shot at her from the window. All this time Kamrul was waiting for him on the bike.

A CCTV footage showed him running back to the bike and the accused speeding off. Police said that they always used helmets during the crimes to ensure they were not caught by traffic police while fleeing or their faces were not identified.

Recently the duo stole a bike from the JJ colony in Bawana and robbed a man near Laxmi Nagar, but while fleeing their bike was hit by a car. They then left the bike at the spot and fled. Two months back they had robbed another man near Pandav Nagar, but few cops spotted them during which Mazhar again abandoned the bike and jumped over rooftops to escape.

Sharma said that a team from Madhu Vihar police station had already informed them about Mazhar’s identity while probing the murder case. It was found that Mazhar and Kamrul were school dropouts and drug addicts.

220,['17/01/2020'],"Kochi: Soon, genome sequencing of Indian oil sardine","The whole genome sequencing will help researchers understand sardine behavior

KOCHI: The whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the Indian oil sardine is likely to be released this year by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI). This will help researchers understand sardine behavior, which is probably leading to falling marine stock or collapse of the fisheries in some areas. The fall in sardine production has affected the overall marine production in most coastal states.According to the CMFRI researchers, the genome sequence is almost 80% complete and has already revealed several distinct characteristics of this commercially important fish which impacts fish production in the country. As the WGS is a process of determining the complete DNA sequence of an organism’s genome at a single time, the DNA markers have already revealed three distinct sub-populations of Indian oil sardine in the Indian ocean region — Gulf of Oman, northwest coast of India and other coasts mainly southwest and southeast coast of India.“The CMFRI will release a draft sequence of genome of Indian oil sardine soon. Even though the CMFRI has found that three types of sardines including Oman sardine have the same genetic structure, separate management strategies are required for these sardines as they live in different waters,” said A Gopalakrishnan, director, CMFRI.The Indian oil sardine fishery is characterized by large annual fluctuations and significant variability in reproduction. The reduction in stock complexity and genetic diversity will affect the resilience of fish stocks and their capacity to recover from extreme reduction in population size due to climatic or environmental effects. Considering these factors, fish stocks should be managed on a regional scale by assessing the number of spawning components and behavioral groups so that stock complexity is preserved and maintained.“Our analysis revealed a population explosion of this species during the Pleistocene Epoch, due to the emergence of upwelling events in the Indian Ocean. In the future, if climate change brings about changes on current patterns and upwelling events, it will affect the abundance and dynamics of Indian oil sardines.

223,['17/01/2020'],Junctions turn into a traffic nightmare,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Kozhikode: The unscientific traffic movement at small junctions on the national highways and other roads in the city are turning these junctions into problem zones.

Unsignalized and unmanned junctions have become accident-prone zones with the increased flow of vehicles.

Successive and unsignalized intersections are causing traffic blocks along the national highway stretches in the city limit. The shortage of manpower in the police also makes it impossible to deploy personnel at every junction.

Absence of warning boards and signals regarding the presence of junctions is a major problem for long-distance vehicles, said Rakesh Mohan, a motorist. The motorists plying on the NH fail to detect the presence of arterial roads and the chances for accidents are high, he added.

The junction on the Puthiyangadi-Kunduparama road connecting to Karaparamba Road, the Puthiyangadi Junction , Chakorathukulam Junction , Vandippetta Junction on NH 766 , East Hill Junction, and YMCA Junction are a few such unmanned junctions which have become traffic bottle necks owing to unscientific movement of vehicles.

Absence of medians and traffic circles and the absence of walkable pathways are also causing difficulties to motorists and pedestrians at such junctions. Inadequate visibility of the intersection, high speed of the vehicles, increased volume, presence of bus stops and auto rickshaw stands at the junctions also increases the chances for accident.

The widening of the road, installation of traffic signals or the appointment of police personnel to control the movement of vehicles are ways to tackle the issue. A number of minor accidents involving two-wheelers and other vehicles were reported on the West Hill Engineering college junction, Barracks Junction and other junctions.

The Puthiyangadi Junction, Kunduparamba Junction and other small junctions are also prone to accidents. Speeding of two-wheelers and other motorists is considered the key reason for the accidents.

Besides, the diversion of traffic through arterial roads and small junctions during road repair work and during the visits of VIPs also cause trouble to public. The use of connecting roads by heavy vehicles including school buses and private buses during congestions worsens the situation as they take extra time to move though the small junctions.

The police cannot appoint cops at each junction as we do not have sufficient manpower, said a senior official. However, we deploy personnel at all junctions when we impose any traffic diversion and the chances for congestion are high, the official added.

NEW DELHI: A 31-year-old man, who worked as a cabin crew earlier, was arrested for trying to dupe people on the pretext of job openings in an airline.

Accused Sanket Jha , who hailed from Maharashtra, posted a message informing job aspirants about the launch of ‘ Yo Airlines ’ in Thailand . He asked interested candidates to send their applications for the job of cabin crew.

Police said that Jha posted an advertisement on Instagram about the vacancies. He had also posted a link asking the candidates to fill in their details and apply. On Wednesday, he called candidates for an interview at a hotel near Bangla Sahib Gurudwara. Jha was a BCom graduate and worked as a cabin crew with an airline for four years.

Officers said that around 300 candidates appeared for the interview, during which Jha asked them to deposit around Rs 2.5 lakh for confirmation of job. One of the women candidates then became suspicious and called police.

A case of cheating was registered and two women, who were also present with the accused, have been served notice to join the investigation.

Bhopal: After hearing far too many imaginative excuses from helmetless bikers, Bhopal police are getting them to put their creativity to better use: write 100-word essays on ‘why I don’t wear a helmet’.

For some, putting 100 words to paper is proving to be a tougher punishment than a Rs 100 fine. Those who write, and write well, stand to get a prize. No prizes for guessing it — a helmet.

“People make ridiculous excuses when they are caught driving without helmet. So, why not ask them to write it,” SI Vivek Gour, who was deployed at Roshanpura Square for the essay writing event on Thursday, told TOI.

227,['17/01/2020'],Burglars steal 41kg of silver jewellery from two stores,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Pune: A gang of burglars broke into two jewellery stores in Wakad and made off with 41kg of silver ornaments and 100gm of gold jewellery, totally worth Rs21.55 lakh, in the early hours of Thursday.

The burglaries happened between 3am and 5am. Pravin Devkar (36), who owns Kanak Jewellers in Kaspte Vasti, and Manohar Chuahan (30), owner of Ambika Jewellers in Rahatni, have lodged complaints with the Wakad police.

The burglars stole 35kg of silver ornaments, the gold and a little cash from Kanak Jewellers. They stole 6kg of silver from Ambika Jewellers.

Devkar told TOI that he was informed at 7am that his store’s shutter was broken. “I reached there and found that they broke the central lock and gained entry,” Devkar said. He said he had installed CCTV cameras in his store. “They stole the DVR and also changed the angle of a CCTV camera of an eatery near my shop,” he said. The complex’s security guards found nothing suspicious at the store during their rounds, around 3am, he said.

Police suspect that the burglars, after the theft at Kanak Jewellers, might have broken into the other store — the lock of the shutter was broken and a safety grill was cut, an officer said. The burglary was discovered around 8am, when a neighbouring shop owner alerted Chauhan, police said.

Assistant inspector Harish Mane said they have dispatched teams to trace the burglars. “We are also checking CCTV footage,” Mane said. Sub-inspector R S Mudal is investigating the case.

228,['17/01/2020'],3 electricity sub-stations commissioned,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Kannur: Minister for electricity M M Mani has said the power deficiency in the district would be solved very soon with the commissioning of the new sub stations.

Inaugurating the newly upgraded 110kV substation and the 110kV double circuit line connecting Sreekantapuram and Vellaparamba at Sreekantapuram in the district on Thursday, he said the government had promised there would be total electrification and there would not be any power cut. Both these promises have been kept and many new projects are coming up in the power distribution sector, he said. The capacity of the earlier substation there was 66kV.

The Rs 4,000-crore project, Dhyuthi, to ensure that there is no power failure, has been started and also the Rs 10,000-crore trans-grid project which would double the transmission and distribution system in the state has begun, he said.

“All these projects would be implemented in a phased manner and once completed the power transmission in the state can be flawlessly managed for the next 50 years,” he said.

In response to the demand mooted by MLA K C Joseph who presided over the function, the minister said the government is ready to open a Vydyuthi Bhavan in the district if a proper place is made available.

The works of the existing hydroelectrical projects are being completed and there is a plan to have a second power station in Idukki, he said. At the same time, solar power has more potential in future and the target is to produce 1,000MW electricity using solar power, said the minister. Out of this, 500MW will be rpoduced using rooftop solar panels while the remaining 500MW would be produced by installing solar panels at the dam sites. As of now the state produces 200MV using solar power and the efforts in this direction are a model for the nation, he said.

Talking about total electrification in the state, the minister said the electrification is remaining in only those places where there is obstacle due to forest. At Edamalakkudy in Wayanad, electricity was provided after installing 35km-long cable, he said.

The minister also commissioned the substations at Kelakam, Nedumpoyil and Vasliyavelicham, all in the hilly areas of the district. Out of this, the one at Nedumpoyil has been upgraded from 66kV to 110kV.

NAGPUR: The low rank of Nagpur among cities having offences per one lakh population, as per the statistics released by the National Crime Records Bureau ( NCRB ) for 2018, has made the police chief BK Upadhyay hopeful about seeing the city finally getting rid of its ‘ Crime Capital ’ tag.

The CP feels that the data of State Crime Records Bureau (SCRB), which is generally released after the NCRB data, for the year 2018 will bring cheers for the city. He feels that with crimes going down, the city would be at least out of the top five.

At a recent press conference, CP had stated that in 2019 the crime rate reduced by 10% as compared to the previous year.

In the NCRB data for 2016 the city was on the second spot in the country in terms of crime rate. It ranked seventh in the statistics of the following year. The city since then has been dubbed as the ‘Crime Capital’, especially to corner former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis who also held the home portfolio then.

Upadhyay said, “In 2016, Nagpur was third in the state as per the SCRB data in crime rate after Amravati and Aurangabad. In the last two years, the number of crimes has gone down by 2,000-2,500 as compared to 2016, which means Nagpur would be comfortably down to either 6th or 7th position or even lower.”

The CP said that showing the city in bad light by calling it ‘Crime Capital’ would be unfair. “Nagpur should be projected as ‘Safe City’ which is a statistically proven fact now,” he said.

A police officer inspects the substation in Ambegaon taluka

PUNE: A 20-year-old youth’s bid to steal copper rod from a power substation in Ambegaon taluka, about 65km from the city, cost him his life on Wednesday.

The youth, Pavan Kadale, suffered 70% burns while trying to remove a copper rod from a live isolator at the Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MSETCL) substation at Pimpalgaon Khadki on Wednesday morning. He succumbed to injuries at the Sassoon General Hospital late in the night.

Devendra Patil, the deputy executive engineer at the MSETCL substation in Pimpalgaon Khadki, lodged an FIR with the Manchar police. He explained, “Isolators transmit power, while the copper rods are used for earthing.”

The tragedy came to light after technicians working at the substation heard a loud noise and rushed out. They saw a youth lying on the ground with burn injuries. “The technicians immediately alerted police and Patil,” the Manchar police said.

Police, after investigations, said the youth and his accomplices could have scaled the wall of the substation to enter its premises after cutting the barbed wire fence. “The substation is secured with a compound wall and a barbed wire fencing. The entrance has 24X7 security and the MSETCL technicians also stay at the substation round the clock,” Patil said.

The Manchar police said the group managed to remove 23 copper rods from three different supply lines when the power was shut. “The youth suffered burns when he tried to remove a copper rod from a live isolator,” the police said.

His accomplices left him injured at spot and fled with 23 copper rods, collectively worth Rs75,000, the police said.

The police took the suspect to a nearby hospital. “He had suffered 70% burns and was shifted to the Sassoon General Hospital in Pune. He had initially given us a fake name to avoid any trouble. When we recorded his statement at the hospital, he revealed his actual identity. He also claimed that he had come alone to the substation,” an officer of the Manchar police said.

The MSETCL’s deputy executive engineer, Patil, said the number of missing copper rods indicated that more people were involved in the theft.

The police have registered an offence under the relevant sections of the Indian Electricity Act. A police team led by inspector Krishnadev Kharade has launched a search for the remaining suspect/s.

PUNE: The Alankar police on Wednesday arrested a 43-year-old man for stealing gold and cash worth Rs9.40 lakh from the home of his late employer in Karvenagar on January 13.

According to the complaint, the suspect stole 300gm of gold biscuits and Rs1.90 lakh. The police said they have recovered the gold biscuits.

Police said the suspect had been employed as an assistant by Satyen Dobhada, a urologist, who died in an accident in June 2018.

Dobhada’s wife Leena (44) lodged an FIR with the police on Wednesday, alleging that the valuables were stolen from her flat. A team of police investigated and arrested Kamble from Kothrud. “We have recovered gold biscuits from the suspect. We are yet to recover the cash,” a police officer said.

According to the complaint, Leena, a medical practitioner, left her flat at 2pm on January 13. When she returned three hours later, she found the locks of the main door and the safety door broken. “She found Rs1.90 lakh and the gold biscuits missing from the cupboard,” the officer said.

After receiving her complaint, a couple of police constables began collecting information about possible suspects. “We got a tip-off about Kamble’s involvement and took him into custody for questioning,” the officer said.

Under sustained questioning, Kamble admitted to stealing the valuables.

Police said Kamble had worked for Dobhada as an assistant. In June 2018, Dobhada — on his way to Lonand, Satara, to perform surgeries, was killed after his car had collided with a van at Nira on Pune-Pandharpur road. Two others died in the accident, while Kamble and the driver escaped with their lives.

Since Kamble had proven trustworthy, Leena started taking his help with odd jobs. “The suspect took advantage of it and committed the burglary,” the officer said.

Manoj and four others, including two women and a child, sustained critical injuries.

A resident of Hisavati village in Bulandshahr district, Manoj tied in a nuptial knot with Shivani, a resident of Chungi Mohalla locality in Chandausi, on Wednesday. After the rituals, the newlywed couple left for Bulandshahr around 7am on Thursday. When the car reached near Bhagatji International School in Behjoi, the driver lost control over the vehicle and crashed into a roadside tree.

Upon hearing their screams, farmers working in nearby fields rushed to the spot and rescued them. They had to chop off the tree to pull out the passengers from the mangled car and informed police.

Police shifted the injured — Manoj and his sisters-in-law Madhu and Neeraj and Madhu’s son Prince, and driver Deepak — to a community health centre, where doctors referred them to a higher medical facility in Moradabad.

Behjoi station house officer inspector Ravindra Pratap Singh said they informed families of the injured and sent the body for postmortem.

237,['17/01/2020'],"New technology may make angioplasty easier, safer","This story is from January 17, 2020

Representative image

NEW DELHI: For patients with a blocked artery , involving heavily calcified blood vessels, a new technology introduced in India recently promises to make angioplasty much easier. It involves ablating the calcium deposition in the artery using sonic waves before putting a stent for improved blood flow.

Having calcified artery causing blockage is seen in about 10% to 15% of patients, especially those who are elderly and diabetic, say doctors.

According to Dr Ashok Seth, chairman, Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, in such patients it becomes difficult to open these blockages and implant stents.

“Intravascular Lithotripsy generates sonic pressure waves to break up problematic calcium so that artery can be opened with ease and blood flow restored with the placement of a stent. The therapy leverages a minimally invasive approach that has been embraced by physicians for decades to treat kidney stones,” he said.

Dr Seth and his team performed the first case in the country on a 67-year-old man with heavily calcified artery. Dr Praveen Chandra, chairman, interventional cardiology at Medanta – The Medicity, Gurgaon, said that they also performed a case using the new technology last week. “Earlier, we had to drill into the artery using special equipment to remove the calcium deposition. It was risky,” he said.

Intravascular Lithotripsy uses a small generator to produce therapeutic sonic pressure waves from a catheter that is threaded through the arterial system to the site of the blockage. The pressure waves pass through the soft vascular tissue, preferentially disrupting the hardened calcified plaque inside the arterial wall by creating a series of micro-fractures, said Gurmit Singh Chugh, CEO, Translumina, partners of Shockwave Medical for India.

Pune: The Pune District Retail Traders’ Association recently organized a protest against online e-commerce firms as part of the nationwide protest held by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) opposing the visit of a leading e-commerce firm’s chief executive officer to India.

Sachin Nivangune, president of the association and CAIT Maharashtra secretary said that the protest was organized in several areas, including Kothrud, Sinhagad Road, Shivajinagar, Sadashiv Peth, Wagholi, Bibvewadi, Karvenagar and Balewadi, among others.

“CAIT has been spearheading an aggressive nationwide movement against e-commerce firms and we support it fully. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on a petition filed by Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh has also ordered DG Enforcement of CCI to investigate the business module of two popular e-commerce firms and investigate the allegations of predatory pricing, deep discounting, loss funding, exclusivity, preferential seller treatment and influencing prices,” said Nivangune.

He added that CAIT will continue its nationwide agitation against such e-commerce players and the action taken by Pune retailers would be based on the decision taken by the confederation. “We have a straightforward agenda that these firms should comply with FDI policy both in letter and spirit or they have to leave India,” he said.

BAREILLY: The Shahjahanpur POCSO court on Thursday awarded 10 years rigorous imprisonment and Rs 20,000 fine to a man who was found guilty of sodomising an eight-year-old boy in Madnapur area of Shahjahanpur district in 2013.

Sohan Singh was booked by police in 2013 under sections 377 of IPC and 3/4 of POCSO Act. A monitoring cell constituted by Shahjahanpur police in 2019 pursued this case and ensured speedy trial and conviction, claimed police.

The judgement was pronounced by additional district and session judge Rashmi Nanda, after additional district government council Rajiv Awasthi produced convincing evidence in court against the accused.

This incident was reported in January 2013, when the victim was playing outside his house in the village. The accused lured him by offering a candy and sodomised him at an abandoned place. The accused was arrested after a police complaint was made by the boy’s parents. A chargesheet was filed and court proceedings initiated in 2013 itself.

Awasthi said, “We welcome the strict punishment which will send a strong message to society against sexual crime against children. Accused Sohan Singh will serve 10 years in jail and pay Rs 20,000 as well. The time he has already spent in jail will be deducted from his total term.”

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

242,['17/01/2020'],‘Mishaps due to lack of road infra high’,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The road accidents statistics for 2018, released by national crime records bureau (NCRB) a few days ago, has a table of data that could prove to be an embarrassment for the capital district. As per the data available with NCRB , Thiruvananthapuram tops the list when it comes to the number of accidents reported due to the lack of proper road infrastructure.

According to NCRB data, Thiruvananthapuram recorded 59 accidents in 2018 where 99 persons were injured and seven others died. The table also had figures of five other major districts in the state. While the figure was zero for Kannur, Kollam and Kozhikode, Kochi recorded 13 accidents with 11 injured persons and Malappuram had 11 accidents where 13 persons were injured.

Kerala Road Safety Authority commissioner N Shanker Reddy said that the lack of proper road infrastructure is a problem for all districts in the state. The reason for the high number of accidents in the capital might be the high traffic volume and undesirable road practices of motorists.

“There is a chance that victims in most of these cases could be pedestrians as many roads here still lack proper footpaths or zebra crossings on roads,” he said. He added that Thiruvananthapuram has a vast area with a lot of narrow roads outside city limits, where accidents may be high.

“Having said so, there has been some improvement on roads here as suggested by the latest figures,” Reddy said. For example, there was a negligible increase (0.2%) in accident fatalities when the figures of 2018 and 2019 are compared. The overall conditions such as road infrastructure, safe driving practices and law enforcement, are improving he said.

Meanwhile, a scientist with national transportation planning and research centre (Natpac) said that though lack of road infrastructure is indeed a problem, the conditions may not be that bad as cited by the figures.

“It all depends on the input given by police personnel who attend different accident cases. Often, a detailed further inquiry does not go into accident cases and officers may cite the cause of accident after drawing conclusions from the preliminary inquiry alone. Another thing we can consider in this case is that police personnel of other districts do not care to go into minute details of the accidents and hence the figures in those districts might appear less,” he said on condition of anonymity.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Thursday stressed that there should be “strict compliance” with the AAP government’s circulars on safety and security standards in schools .

The court’s directions came as it disposed of a suo motu matter to improve the conditions in Delhi schools, and for framing guidelines to make them accountable for children’s safety. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar said Delhi government has already issued circulars and taken steps to maintain safety and security standards in schools, and there remained no justification for HC to continue monitoring.

The bench disposed of the matter after AAP government informed that the circulars were issued asking the schools to carry out a police verification of the support staff, counselling and sensitisation of all staff, installation of CCTV cameras and providing separate washrooms for girl students.

Taking note, the court said only the implementation of the circulars, in letter and spirit, by the schools was required to be ensured, and ordered “there shall be strict compliance with the circulars by the schools in accordance with law.” It added that if there was any violation by any school, action would be taken.

Prior to passing of the order, advocate Ashok Agarwal said that while the government was taking steps and issuing circulars, they were not being complied with by the schools.

Pune: The civic body has set the monsoon deadline for finishing the Ambil Odha repair and rejuvenation project, including construction of a retaining wall along it.

A meeting regarding the restoration project was held in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). “The civic administration has approached the state government for financial help for the project. The work must be completed in five months. If the funds are available, it will be completed within the deadline,” said Prashant Waghmare, the city engineer, PMC, on Thursday.

The deluge on September 25 had flooded Katraj, Sahakarnagar, Satara road, Katraj-Kondhwa road, Indiranagar, Bibvewadi and some other areas. Several lives were lost, too. Public amenities like gardens, water pumping stations and cultural halls were damaged.

The PMC has planned a restoration project for Ambil Odha at an estimated cost of around Rs250 crore. The civic administration will spend Rs78 crore. The corporation has sought help of the state government for funding the rest of the amount — Rs172 crore. The civic administration is also seeking help from other government authorities like Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA).

The money would be spent on fitting protective mesh along the nullah, deepening of the channel, reconstruction of culverts and roads along the nullah, action against illegal constructions and encroachments, and survey of properties along the nullah.

Nearly 60 people participated as support trekkers in the eco expedition held last year

PUNE: New scientific revelations have come out of city-based mountaineering club Giripremi’s Kangchenjunga eco expedition last year.

Mountaineers and trekkers had collected samples from the base camps and the expedition which they brought back to scientists at Savitribai Phule Pune University and other research institutes.

Umesh Zirpe, team leader of the expedition, said, “This is the first time in India that such an expedition was conducted. Kangchenjunga is on the border of India and Nepal. So the eco expedition was on both sides to the base camps. Nearly 60 people participated as support trekkers, and we called them eco trekkers,” he said.

Avinash Kandekar, assistant professor of the department of geography from the Savitribai Phule Pune University, was the coordinator of sample collection throughout the expedition.

“The base camp expedition was divided into two groups, one from the Sikkim side and another group from the Nepal side. Seven students from the SPPU’s department of geography also took part and three went on to do their research on this,” he said.

Core samples were taken from four glacial lakes of Sukha Pokhari, Lakshmi Pokhari, Samiti Lake and Lam Pokhari. “We drilled a hole into the rocky portions of these lakes to collect the samples,” he said.

Shubham Gavhane, who participated as a postgraduate student of geography, submitted his dissertation on the expedition entitled — Late Holocene Environmental Magnetic changes at Lam Pokhari Lake; Implications to climate change .

Now, an assistant professor of geography at D Y Patil Arts Commerce and Science College in Pimpri, Gavhane said, “We conducted an analysis on mineral magnetic change which gives an idea of the climate change that took place over the last few years. As we go deeper, we get the longer years’ record of climate.”

Mineral magnetic analysis gives the trend of change in climatic condition in that particular valley. “We also took up the particle size analysis which gives an idea of the variations in the size of particles in different layers. Lastly, we conducted a mineral identification under microscope and identified the different minerals at different depths in the samples that were collected,” he added.

Through the samples, Kandekar said, they were able to gauge that it dated back to around the time of the Holocene era.

“The Holocene period is an inter-glaciation period, where the snow started melting. Some samples we got are from the bottom of the lake and most of them have a chance of being either from the Holocene period or before. We have sent the samples to an Ahmedabad-based institute for the exact dating. The samples are divided into the bottom, middle and surface samples where the sediments have settled over ages,” Kandekar said.

Vijayawada: The outskirts of Vijayawada within the commissionerate limits witnessed several illegal cockfighting events and cops managed to crackdown on 104 persons and registered 27 cases during the last two days of Sankranti festival.

According to official data, they also seized 62 cockerels and recovered Rs 1.7 lakh cash from gambling spots.

Cops also recovered 103 cockfighting knives commonly known as Tari.

The enforcement figures of Krishna district police unit stand much higher than Vijayawada due to their larger jurisdiction.

A total number of 313 persons were arrested and Rs 1.1 lakh cash was seized along with 185 roosters and 208 knives. Apart from the cockfighting gambling rackets, cops also cracked down on other gambling rackets like ‘Kotha Mukka’ and ‘Matka’ card games and recovered more cash. In Vijayawada, they seized Rs 4.4 lakh cash and registered 13 cases against 87 people. Krishna district police unit registered 47 cases against 143 persons and seized Rs 8.2 lakh cash from them.

Regardless of the enforcement, the bloodsport did take place unabated at the suburban regions of Yanamalakuduru, Pedapulipaka and Edupugallu villages under the commissionerate limits. They also took blatantly place in Gudivada, Nuzvid, Avanigadda and other places in the Krishna district where the stakes were higher as several lakhs of cash are said to be exchanging hands.

The steps taken by the police to keep cockfights and gambling in check have not been entirely successful in the area.

253,['17/01/2020'],Coimbatore: Vegetable prices drop as local supply picks up momentum,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Representative image

COIMBATORE: Prices of several commonly used vegetables have started to gradually drop as the harvest season is around the corner. While in some cases prices have already decreased by 10%, farmers said they would become more cheaper in the next two weeks.

While harvest has begun in other states and a few other places in Tamil Nadu, the district is gearing up for the same. A source said the district was likely to harvest vegetables starting next week. While farmers are watching the prices cautiously, many homemakers are heaving a huge sigh of relief.

On Thursday, big onion was priced at Rs 63 per kg, compared to Rs 80 in the first week of January and Rs 100 in the last week of December. The cauliflower price, which remained at Rs 52 per kg through December and January first week, dropped to Rs 48, while Beetroot prices came down to Rs 58.5 per kg from Rs 68.

While tomato and carrot prices have marginally increased by Rs 2 to Rs 8 per kg, people said the hike wouldn’t affect the kitchen budget. Hemalatha A, a resident of RS Puram, said, “Compared to two months ago when the price of vegetables such as onion and drumstick increased by Rs 80 to Rs 100 per kg, this week is a relief to shop.”

She said there was nothing to be concerned over the marginal increase in the tomato and carrot prices as onion, beetroot and cauliflower have become cheaper. “It won’t affect our budget. In fact, we could now spend more on fruits,” she said.

Vegetable traders said except for shallot and drumstick, prices of vegetables were slowly returning to normal. S S N Jothi, from Odanchathiram vegetable market, said, “Prices have begun coming down as we are receiving supplies from surrounding districts and villages. In fact, we are primarily selling only local vegetables now.”

However, drumstick and onion continue to come from other states such as Karnataka, Gujarat and Maharashtra, among others.

While harvest of vegetables has begun in the region, farmers said it would take another one week to start the same in a full-fledged manner. P Kandasamy, state secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam, said, “Our vegetables are growing well because of good rain that we received during monsoon. Harvest will take place over the next one week in the region.”

G A Wahab, a member of Saibaba Colony Vegetable Traders’ Association , attributed the fall in vegetable prices to increased supply from Sathyamangalam-Annur stretch, where harvest has begun. “We can expect the prices to fall further as local supply increases. Brinjal price hasn’t seen any fluctuation so far as the crop is hit by fog and mist situation.”

254,['17/01/2020'],PMC says trash dumping down to ‘zero’ at Uruli,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Pune: The civic administration on Thursday said dumping of garbage at the Urali Devachi depot has been finally stopped.

A senior Pune Municipal Corpration (PMC) official claimed that the practice of open dumping of garbage in Uruli Devachi came to an end on Wednesday after 25 years and the administration was looking forward to continue with the new arrangement.

The civic body had in the past pledged to not send garbage-laden trucks to Uruli Devachi and Phursungi after December 31, 2019. However, it had failed to meet the deadline. This prompted the residents of the two villagers to stop the trucks reaching their areas. They were also mulling over to intensify the agitation. The residents had then put on hold the agitation, as the PMC sought two more weeks to stop the practice.

“We have brought down garbage dumping in Uruli to ‘zero’. The waste is now going to other plants for processing. We have been doing this on an experimental basis for the past 15 days,” said Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of the PMC’s solid waste management department.

The official said the administration has increased the daily garbage processing at its existing processing plants to treat the trash not reaching the Uruli depot. “Besides, a 700-tonne capacity plant at Hadapsar, which was not working at its full capacity, is now operational at the optimum capacity. Steps have been taken to ensure that the waste is not left unattended to at the ramp sites, Molak said.

A senior official from the solid waste management department said the civic body was planning to permanently stop dumping of garbage at the depot in the next four months. At least eight plants of various capacities are expected to become operational by then.

The residents of Uruli Devachi and Phursungi have said they would keep a watch on the situation for the next few days. Bhagwan Bhadale, a resident, said, “We need to see if the PMC keeps its promise this time. The civic administration had violated such promises on many occasions in the past.

Civic activists have sought detailed analysis of the PMC’s claims and how the garbage was being processed in the city. “If the PMC can start processing garbage at the existing plants within two weeks, then why was it not done before December 31, 2019? The PMC should make public details of waste processing during the last three months,” said Vivek Velankar of citizens’ group Sajag Nagrik Manch.

PUNE: Over 180 passengers aboard an IndiGo flight to Jaipur suffered a mid-air scare in the early hours of Thursday when the Airbus A320neo aircraft, with Pratt & Whitney engines, had to be diverted to Mumbai after heavy vibrations.The flight had taken off from the city around 3.40am, a source said, and was supposed to land in Jaipur by 5.35am. Heavy vibrations in one of the engines of the aircraft rattled the passengers at an altitude of around 30,600 feet. The lead pilot (commander) then decided to divert and land at Mumbai airport, the nearest at the time.A spokesperson of the airline said, “An IndiGo flight 6E-6129 (A320) operating from Pune to Jaipur was diverted to Mumbai this morning. During the flight, the pilot got an engine vibration alert and followed the laid standard operating procedure. The flight landed in Mumbai. The aircraft is currently under inspection there. All passengers were accommodated in another aircraft to Jaipur.”A source said, “At 4.25am, the emergency was declared, and the pilots decided to divert the aircraft. The flight landed in Mumbai around 4.40am. The other flight assigned to the passengers departed around 7.35am for Jaipur.”A passenger aboard the aircraft said, “There was a sudden jerk, followed by a few more. We did not quite understand the issue, but realised that something was wrong. The cabin crew was initially quiet. The pilot then announced that the flight was being diverted, and that’s when some passengers panicked.”Another source said the engines of the aircraft was last inspected on December 9. The next inspection was scheduled after the completion of 500 cycles (flights), but one of its engines developed snag during the 255th flight.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) earlier directed that these aircraft (A320Neos) could operate if at least one of their engines was modified. The DGCA recently extended the deadline for modifying the Pratt & Whitney (P&W) engines of these aircraft to March 31 from January 31. Apart from IndiGo, GoAir has A320Neo aircraft with P&W engines.Both the airlines encountered similar incidents in the recent past. This is the 21st snag petaining to IndiGo aircraft in two years. In October last year, a Pune-bound IndiGo plane returned to Kolkata after take-off because of an engine snag. Another IndiGo flight from Pune to Nagpur had to return to the city in April last year because of a similar problem.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73323256,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-91369,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/indigo-flight-diverts-to-mumbai-after-mid-air-engine-vibrations/articleshow/73310503.cms

258,['17/01/2020'],29 detained for anti-CAA stir without nod,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Bareilly: Police in Bareilly have detained 29 anti-CAA protesters who tried to stage a sit-in at the Azad College ground without permission on Wednesday night.

Police initially tried to convince them to take requisite permission before entering the college ground for the sit-in, but the protesters, who were not led by anyone and a few of them were from outside the Bareilly district, refused to budge. Police had to use force to disperse the crowd.

Among the 29 detained, eight were charged under section 151 of IPC (knowingly joining or continuing in assembly of five or more persons after it has been commanded to disperse) while others were released after warning.

According to sources, several people from neighbouring towns of Uttarakhand and a few from Jharkhand and Bihar, who are living in Bareilly for their livelihood, had come to the ground to support the protest of Ittehad-e-Millat Council (IMC) chief Tauqeer Raza Khan. Raza was protesting at Islamia school ground since Monday but he decided to call off the protest on Wednesday evening after a few groups attempted to sit at the same venue in support of CAA.

Bareilly SSP Shailesh Pandey sent extra force from reserve police lines to the spot and SHOs from Premnagar, Kotwali, and Cantonment police stations were also rushed to tackle any untoward situation.

Additional SP Abhishek Verma, who led the police action, told TOI, “After IMC’s protest was over, several outsiders from Uttrakhand, Bihar and Jharkhand attempted to stage protest and even tried to disrupt peace. They were around 500 to 600 in numbers and were led by Mohammed Rizwan from Kichcha town in Uttarakhand. After requesting them for several hours, we had to use our force to disperse the crowd at midnight. Our intelligence report said that a few antisocial elements were intending to spread violence here. We had checked with local leaders but no one was leading the protest from Bareilly.”

“We had taken 29 persons under custody and 20 of them were released upon furnishing personal bond while 9 were presented in court where seven were granted bail while their leader Rizwan was sent to 14-day judicial custody. No one was hurt in the process,” the ASP said.

“We have registered an FIR against 29 named and nearly 200 unidentified persons under relevant sections of IPC at Baradari police station. We are keeping an eye on all the suspicious activities and all our security agencies are on alert,” he added.

Tauqeer Raza Khan told TOI, “We called off our protest because a few antisocial elements were attempting to disrupt peace. We have no idea about the outsiders who came to join protest. For us, peace in the city is our priority.”

259,['17/01/2020'],PIL afoot to make local bodies responsible for water supply,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Pune: Akhil Bharatiya Grahak Panchayat, a Pune-based consumer activists group, intends to file a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in Bombay High Court, demanding that the government make all local civic bodies responsible for providing water if building permission is granted by them for any construction.

A mere affidavit from the builder declaring that he would provide water from any of the available sources should not merit grant of building permission, stated activist Vijay Sagar. He along with the Pune district housing federation president Suhas Patwardhan and members of various housing societies have written to the state government on the issue.

Now, they intend to file a PIL demanding that all local civic bodies be made responsible for providing water if building permission is granted by them after collecting the required fee.

The group is currently in the process of collecting data of water usage and requirement for water tankers from all housing societies in Pune. With many housing societies in fringe areas such as Kharadi, Wagholi, Undri and Katraj dependent on water tankers for almost throughout the year, developers who had submitted affidavit for granting of building permission have backed out, leaving the citizens to fend for themselves.

The activists in their letter stated that the local authority should not hold individuals, such as developers or consumers, to run after water source after the construction is completed.

Corporations and even the metropolitan authorities accept affidavits from builders stating that they are responsible for supplying water. Building permission is granted once the local authority receives the affidavits.

In 2007, residents of Mohammadwadi and Vimannagar raised the issue with the local authority but without much success.

The residents told TOI that they have to depend on tankers for water supply. “It is an ordeal for us year after year and our society spends lakhs on tankers,’’ said a resident.

Three years back a divisional bench of Bombay HC had imposed temporary restrictions on PMC from sanctioning new projects in the Baner-Balewadi areas or granting occupancy certificates for completed buildings till the water issue was addressed.

Their demands

Local authority should be held responsible for all infrastructure provisions, including water

The onus should be made accountable and not builder

Water affidavits should not be the yardstick for granting building permission to increase their coffer

As development fee is collected, water has to be provided

NEW DELHI: Fourteen cars, including a BMW , were charred in east Delhi’s Vivek Vihar in the wee hours on Thursday . The cars belonged to a sale and purchase dealer, who had parked them in an empty plot opposite to the Vivek Vihar police station due to lack of space. Three fire tenders were rushed to the location to douse the blaze.

The cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained.

The dealer, Vivek Walia, alleged that someone had purposely set the cars on fire. “There is no way all of them would have caught fire together. These cars were not even covered under insurance,” he said.

According to the fire department officials, a call was received around 2.30am on Thursday about a blaze opposite the Vivek Vihar police station. “The fire engulfed fourteen old cars but no one sustained any injuries in the blaze,” they added.

“Our guard informed us about the fire. We reached there only to see 13-14 cars in flames. We want a through enquiry into this. Cars do not catch fire like this. They were parked at a distance from each another,” said Walia.

The crime and forensic team was called to lift evidence from the spot.

Pune: Kidney donor Pramod Mahajan (68), a marginal farmer from Sangli district, will soon set out on a tour of 94 cities covering 17,500km on his motorbike from January 18 to spread awareness about organ donation.

“I am hale and hearty and raring to take up this mission. I look forward to this journey as it has given me a cause,” Mahajan said.

Pune-based NGO ReBirth Foundation, in association with Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC) and Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization, will flag off Mahajan’s pan-India motorbike tour from Patrakar Bhavan in Navi Peth at 11am on Saturday. Mahajan is a member of the NGO, which works in the field of organ donation and keeps a record of potential organ donors.

“This time, I will be riding an Avenger motorcycle with 220CC engine. ReBirth Foundation has provided the motorbike for the expedition. In 2018, I had used my own Yamaha Libero motorcycle for the 100-day bike expedition for organ donation,” Mahajan said.

In 2018, Mahajan, had embarked on the solo journey from Shaniwarwada on October 21, and completed it on January 25, 2019, at Sarasbaug. It had taken him 100 days to travel over 12,000km across the country. Over 10,000 people had supported the cause by filling in organ donation forms during the course of his journey.

“Unlike last year, when I had travelled to 19 states in 100 days, I am going to cover 28 states in 132 days this year. I have included states in northeast India and some union territories like Diu and Daman in this year’s itinerary,” Mahajan said.

His talk on organ donation has inspired many. “People listen to me with intent and take my word seriously because I am not just delivering talks on organ donation, I have myself donated one of my kidneys to a needy stranger,” Mahajan said.

He had donated one of his kidneys to a former employee of Central Industrial Security Force around 18 years ago.

“Besides, Mahajan embodies the very fact that a kidney donor can actually lead a normal and healthy life. He confesses that he has had absolutely no health issues since donating his kidney,” said transplant coordinator at ZTCC Aarti Gokhale.

Mahajan lives with his wife in Sangli district’s Dhavali village. Apart from farming, he sells books to earn a living. “During the last bike expedition, except for a cold, I didn’t suffer any health issues. I am fitter and I do not have any underlying medical conditions,” Mahajan signed off.

Thiruvananthapuram: Ever thought of sipping your juice with a grass straw or carrying a food in a bag made from tapioca extract? An exhibition that is organized as part of ‘ Suchitwa Sangamam 2020 ’ in the city offers an array of such alternatives for single-use plastic .

The exhibition consists of around 120 stalls and demonstrates methods to avoid plastics from daily life.

A group of MSc students from School of Environmental Sciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, made bio straw from common invasive grass species. Shijo Joy, Abijth and Ajith are the brains behind this. “We all know about the side-effects of plastic. When we thought of a solution to reduce plastic, we thought of bamboo straws and those made of special grass in Vietnam. So we decided to work with the raw materials available in our area and tried with many plants, including paddy and wheat, and finally ended with grass,” the students said. The product is made from the stem of common grass, locally called as ‘Potha’.

It is a handmade product, where the hollow stem of the grass is cut and cleaned with some treatments to prevent fungus and other bacterial growth. Then the stems are dried in sunlight. The durability of these straws is 4 to 5 months and rate is Rs 1. The students plan to take this product into the market and to make it commercially available.

The show also presents carry bags made of starch extracts from eatables such as tapioca and is mixed with biodegradable polymer. These bags have high-loading performance and can be recycled with paper. The bags are soluble in water and will produce carbon when burned as paper. This product has been brought to the exhibition by companies ‘Breathing Earth’ and ‘Bio Mart’. Bio Mart also brings out transparent containers made out of corn and plates made of sugarcane starch. There are other stalls also which showcase plates and spoons of sugarcane bagasse. These companies are looking for a market in Kerala and expressed their hope that the people will support these ecofriendly products.

Kerala Agriculture University showcases fast bio decomposer that runs with electricity.

NAMAKKAL: Taking a cue from jallikattu , residents of Nandavanam Street in Tiruchengode here on Thursday organized an interesting game for the women folk - they had to catch a hen/rooster tied to their leg.

S Devendran, one of the event organizers, said while jallikattu tested one’s bravery, the game that they organized was intended to put the contestants’ intelligence into test.

“In this game, a hen or rooster will be tied to the participants’ legs using a rope. The participants will be blindfolded and left in a circle. They have to catch the hen or rooster within the stipulated time, while ensuring neither they nor the bird go outside the circle,” Devendran said.

He said the game wasn’t anything new to the village. “We are conducting the event for the 11th consecutive year.”

Representational Image

BAREILLY: A 21-year-old rape survivor gave birth to a baby who died two hours after the delivery at a community health centre in Nighasan area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on Wednesday.

The girl was allegedly raped by her cousin in Sampoornanagar last April and the accused is currently lodged in Lakhimpur district jail. The baby’s body was sent for autopsy and a DNA test would be conducted on survivor’s request so that it could be used as evidence against the accused.

According to sources, the girl had visited her uncle’s house last year where she was repeatedly raped by her cousin for nearly a month. Her cousin allegedly threatened to kill her which forced her to remain quiet. The crime came to light when she got pregnant and was sent back home by her uncle. After returning home, she narrated her ordeal to her parents. A police complaint was then filed against her cousin under the section of rape.

There were repeated talks between both the families for a compromise but the accused refused to marry the girl. In the meantime, police continued their investigation and sent the accused to jail on December 10 after collecting evidence.

On the other hand, the girl refused to abort her child and felt labour pain on the night on Tuesday and delivered a baby girl on Wednesday morning. However, the newborn was very weak and died within two hours of delivery. The survivor’s father said that his daughter was under severe depression which possibly affected the health of her baby as well.

SHO Nighasan police station Deepak Shukla said, “The rape survivor’s family had requested us to send the baby’s body for autopsy and collect sample for DNA test, to be used as evidence in their case. The FIR in this case was registered at Sampoornanagar police station and we will share the autopsy report and other information with them as per standard procedure.”

Pimpri Chinchwad: The civic body will start a pilot project for the early detection and intervention of disabilities in pre- and post-birth children up to six years at 10 centres.

Assistant commissioner of urban community development department Ulhas Jagtap said a contract will be signed soon with the district disability rehabilitation centre, Pune, for the project. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation will be the first civic body in the state to implement such a project.

A senior civic official said early detection and intervention for disability rehabilitation is the way ahead.

“It comprises disability prevention, reducing severity of disability and preparing a child having permanent disability for the future. It is also a method for parental acceptance of a disabled child in the family for medical and social rehabilitation,” he added.

The civic body proposes to start early intervention centres by strengthening the infrastructure of anganwadis/ balwadis first and then scale it up. “We are approaching the Union government's district disability rehabilitation centre to collaborate,” he said.

The project will be implemented on a pilot basis at 10 centres in five anganwadis and five balwadis which will be shortlisted. The total budget allocated for early intervention for one year is Rs 72 lakh.

The anganwadis and balwadis in the slum and gaothan areas will be picked for the pilot project. A survey of every household in the jurisdiction will be conducted.

“Tests of pregnant women will be conducted for finding any disability in the foetus. Tests will be conducted on newborn children for early detection of any disability. Audiometry tests, OAE and Bera tests brainstem evoked response and audiometer testing will be conducted at Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial hospital in Pimpri, the official,” he added.

270,['17/01/2020'],2.5L teachers needed for Census process,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Pune: The Census department wants the Maharashtra government to provide 2.5 lakh teachers for the decennial headcount and collection of National Population Register (NPR) data across the state.

Census officials said the teachers would be helpful for the work once the formal notification was issued. Maharashtra is yet to receive the notification on the NPR drive to be carried out between April and September across the country.

The officials said department’s work was listing of houses, the first phase of the Cencus work and NPR data collection. An official said 137 “master trainers” in Pune have been guided and 3,800 teachers would be trained once the notification was issued.

“The notification is expected from the general administration department headed by the chief minister,” a senior Census official said on Thursday. In Maharashtra, the drive was supposed to be held in May-June. Congress cabinet minister Varsha Gaikwad recently issued a statement that the Maha Vikas Aghadi would not allow the rollout of NPR drive in May.

Census department officials have undergone training in the past three months. “Once the notification is issued, no official can refuse the work. It is like election duty. The enumerators entrusted with the house-listing task will have to simultaneously collect the NPR data,” the official said.

The NPR is supposed to record the “usual residents” of the country living in an area for the past six months or more or people willing to stay there for the next six months or more. The Census involves collection of information about all residents of India without listing their names.

Under Section 4 (2) of the Census of India Act, 1948, the state may appoint persons as Census officers to take, aid in or supervise the taking of the census within any specified local area and such persons, when so appointed, shall be bound to serve accordingly. Rule 5 of the Citizenship Rules, 2003, states that every official of the Centre and state government shall assist the Registrar General of Citizen Registration in preparation of the database.

Section 11 of the Census of India Act lays down the penalties — imprisonment up to three years and/or fine — for government or any other staff declining to aid in conduct of census. Any refusal to perform NPR duty may invite up to Rs1,000 fine under Rule 17 of the Citizenship Rules, 2003.

Vijayawada: The long wait for the announcement of the rank and file of AP Congress ended on Thursday with the party’s national leadership appointing former minister Sake Sailajanath state president. Former MP and APCC vice-president N Tulasi Reddy and former MLA Shaik Mastan Vali will assume charge as working presidents.

The APCC president’s post fell vacant following the resignation of former minister N Raghuveera Reddy immediately after the 2019 general elections. Several senior leaders lobbied for the post including former Union ministers M M Pallam Raju and J D Seelam.

However, the AICC leadership cleared the candidature of Sailajanath, a loyalist of late YS Rajasekhar Reddy.

The Congress had lost most of its cadre and voter base in the state to YSRC after Jaganmohan Reddy walked out of the party in 2009 and formed his own outfit.

Pune: The period piece Anandi Gopal and the coming-of-age drama Tujhya Aaila were big winners in the Marathi Competition category of the Pune International Film Festival (PIFF). The Tunisian film A Son bagged the top honour in the World Competition.

The awardees were announced at the ceremony held at the National Film Archive of India (NFAI) on Thursday, which marked the end of this year’s edition of PIFF. All jury members, Malini Fonseka, Dubravka Lakic, Mazhar Kamran, Rajula Shah, Istvan Kovacs, Vishka Assayesh, Lutz Konnerman, and Marie-Pierre Bretas, were present during the ceremony. Veteran actor Vikram Gokhale and sound designer Bishwadeep Chatterjee gave away the awards.

The jury at this year’s festival adjudged films both in the World and Marathi Competition sections, unlike last year. Besides the awards for the best film and director in both sections, the organizers gave away special mentions and jury awards, as well as acting, screenplay, and cinematography awards only for Marathi films.

Mehdi Barsaoui’s film A Son was adjudged the Best International Film of the festival. Bartosz Kruhlik was named the Best Director for the film Supernova. The actor Wagner Moura’s directorial debut Marighella was awarded a special mention. Moura is better known for playing Pablo Escobar in the Netflix drama Narcos.

Sujay Dahake’s film Tujhya Aaila, which deals with abuse that children hear and the ways in which they navigate the situation, got a special jury award apart from awards for cinematography and screenplay for Vijay Mishra and Niyaz Mujawar.

Anandi Gopal, a film about one of the first female doctors in the Indian subcontinent, won the top honour as the Best Film. The award is named after Sant Tukaram and sponsored by the government of Maharashtra. Lalit Prabhakar, who played Anandibai’s husband Gopal in the film, also won the Best Actor award. He said that the process of ‘unlearning’ for his role was a daunting challenge.

“For researching my role, I read the letters that Gopal Joshi had written during his lifetime. Those letters brought out a lot of things, like his views and his personality. There was also the task of unlearning a lot of things. It was back in the 1800s, and there was a way in which people styled themselves and spoke. I had to make sure that while acting, none of my current trappings came in the way,” Prabhakar said.

Mukta Barve took home the Best Actress award for her role in the film Y. That film’s director Ajit Wadikar bagged the Best Director award.

COIMBATORE: The job profile of S Ayyappan , a 34-year-old assistant teacher at the Government Residential School for tribal children at Lingamavur in Udumalpet, Tirupur, is to teach the 23 tribal children in class. However, he doesn’t stop with that. He also grooms them and washes their clothes .The teacher, who joined the school in October 2018, says when he first saw the children, they were unkempt and weren’t groomed properly.“All through the year, the children stay at the school hostel and go home only during festivals such as Diwali or Pongal. Their parents come to visit them once a month. When I asked them why they weren’t groomed, they would say their parents had found no work and couldn’t visit them to take them out for a haircut,” he says.It was then that Ayyappan took upon himself to give the students their regular haircut. “When I was young, I had learnt to cut my own hair. With that practice, I started giving haircuts to my students,” he says.There are 12 boys and 11 girls in the school, aged five to 10 years. They are studying in classes I to V. The children belong to tribes such as Irulars and Kadars from Thirumoorthy Malai, Udumalai, Valparai and Anamalai. Their parents work as labourers in farms or tea estates. The school was started in 1997.Earlier, the students used to wash their clothes on the bathroom floor. Ayyappan, with the help of the school headmaster M Pandi, built a washing stone in the campus.“But even then, the kids were playful and didn’t wash their clothes properly. So, I started washing their clothes,” adds the teacher.Ayyappan did his schooling from Ramakrishna Ashram’s Children’s Home at Pallapalayam in Coimbatore. “There, we had to take monthly turns in doing ashram work, such as puja, cooking, tending to cattle, etc. This instilled a sense of service in me, because of which I want to help my students,” he says. Ayyappan credits his Class XII teacher Murugesan who helped him pursue teacher training at the institute of education training in Kotagiri.Pandi says Ayyappan is the first teacher he has seen who does so much for the students. “Because of his approach, students’ behaviour too has improved in class. His friendly and helpful nature have made students behave well and pay attention in classes,” says the headmaster.",coimbatore,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73317234,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-498574,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/this-teacher-of-tribal-school-grooms-students-washes-their-clothes/articleshow/73310615.cms

Amaravati: The state government has decided to clear the bills proposed to repeal AP CRDA Act and The AP Decentralisation and Equal Development of All Regions Act, 2020 through a joint session of the assembly and council on January 22.

The decision has been taken keeping in view of TDP’s majority in the Upper House which is most likely to veto the bills proposed by the government. The joint session will bring the uncertainty over the capital city to an end despite uproarious protests in Amaravati.

The state government has already decided to convene the special session of the assembly on January 20 and council on January 21. Although YSRC could get through the bills in the assembly thanks to its massive majority in the House, the bills are likely to be turned down by the Council where TDP has numbers to dictate terms.

As per the procedure, the bills vetoed by the council would again go to the assembly for reconsideration. The bill will once again go to the council after ratification by the assembly.

Although the council could not reject the bill for second time, the government does not want to wait for the process to get completed.

With a view to avoid delay in clearing the bills which chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy wanted to rush through, the government is contemplating to convene the joint session of the assembly and council on January 22.

In such case, the government could easily sail through the voting as it has bumper majority if the numbers of both the Houses are taken into count.

YSRC political strategists took the recent experience where the TDP dominated council rejected the bill to introduce English medium in government schools even after it was cleared by the assembly during the winter session.

“We have our own strategy to get the bills cleared. People gave us mandate to take the decisions that benefits the larger sections of the state. We will not disappoint anyone except the gangs working with vested interests and are headed by Chandrababu Naidu,” said chief whip Gadikota Srikanth Reddy.

Ahmedabad: After affirming their affidavits first from Virginia in the US and St Michael in Barbados, the two missing women from Nithyananda ashram have affirmed their affidavits before the Indian high commission in Jamaica.

The affidavits were tendered before the Gujarat high court on Thursday in response to the habeas corpus petition filed by the father of the women. The HC was not satisfied with the affidavits filed on two earlier occasions and had suggested that the court may take them into consideration, only if they are affirmed before the Indian high commission.

However, the girl’s father vehemently opposed the affidavits and raised questions on their authenticity. It was suggested on his behalf that such affidavits should be verified by an Indian embassy, for his daughters appeared to have been coerced to sign the affidavits.

The father’s advocate reiterated that her daughters’ lives are in danger and they should be asked to appear personally before the court and express their wish. The father has been claiming that Nithyananda and his associates have forcibly detained his daughters and illegally sent his younger daughter (19) to an island in the West Indies via Nepal in November last year after he demanded custody of his three children living in the Ahmedabad ashram.

In the third batch of affidavits also, the petitioner’s daughters rejected their father’s claim that they have been detained forcibly.

Accused in police custody

Rajkot: An absconding loot and murder accused was nabbed near Khambhalia of Devbhoomi Dwarka district on Wednesday.

Police said the accused, identified as Navaz Detha, had allegedly bludgeoned Allarakha Bhati to death in Pirlakhasar village of Khambhalia taluka last year.

Detha had allegedly committed the murder along with his friend Gulab Qureshi.

After Qureshi came to know that Bhati was carrying cash, he hatched the loot and murder conspiracy with Detha. Both attacked Bhati with bats and iron pipes, killing him on the spot. They hid Bhati’s body in the bushes near a river and had looted Rs 4,000 cash from his pocket.

Besides this, Detha had stolen 20 metre long cable wire worth Rs 12,000 from a windmill in Shethakhai village of Bhanwad taluka in Devbhoomi Dwarka district, three years ago.

“We had received a tip-off that Detha was going towards Pirlakhasar village from Khambhalia on his two-wheeler, following which we kept a watch there and nabbed him,” said M D Chandrawadia, inspector with Devbhoomi Dwarka local crime branch.

Thiruvananthapuram: On Thursday, a forensic team examined the brown Maruti Suzuki Estilo that was allegedly involved in a hit-and-run accident near Sasthamangalam that killed two persons at 9pm on December 29. Police sources said that preliminary examination of the vehicle did not yield any evidence that the vehicle was involved in an accident.

“Prima facie, the car appears to be in good condition and there were no dents or damages that could happen due to a collision,” said an officer who is part of the probe team. The car belongs to Sadanandan (47), a clerical staff of Raj Bhavan, who stays in the staff quarters. On Wednesday, police had confiscated his car.

The forensic team has not drawn conclusions from spot examination. Since the car was tracked down after over two weeks, there is still the possibility of the owner carrying out repair works. Hence a detailed scientific examination will be conducted to ascertain that angle and the team collected evidence from the car for the purpose.

Online food delivery executive Abdul Rahim (44) from Nedumangad and Aditya B Manoj (21) from Sasthamangalam were killed in the accident. While Abdul Rahim, who was standing on the side of the road, died on the spot, Aditya, who was riding a motorcycle, died on January 10 after battling for his life in a hospital.

Police are yet to comprehend the sequence of events that led to the accident. A car was seen on CCTV as it stopped momentarily at the accident spot and later disappeared mysteriously as onlookers were busy trying to get the injured to a hospital. They only remembered a brown Estilo.

Police found the car after compiling a list of 1,600 Zen Estilo cars registered in city. Police filtered the list down to those registered near Vellayambalam and Sasthamangalam region and finally located it. Sadanandan was then summoned to Museum police station for questioning on Wednesday.

During questioning, Sadanandan claimed that his vehicle was not involved in the accident and that he had heard a loud noise while passing the spot, on December 29. He then slowed down his car and saw the mishap. A passerby had then accused him of causing the accident. He claimed that he explained the sequence of events to that person and that person let him go. Police have not registered a case against Sadanandan as his role in the accident is yet to be ascertained.

COIMBATORE: People thronged CODISSIA grounds to celebrate Mattu Pongal in a traditional way in the city on Thursday.

The celebrations, which were organized by Nayam, an event planner, included traditional games like Aadupuchi Attam, Uriyadithal, Vazhuku Maram, Silambam and Malutham as well as traditional dances like Parai, Parai Thapattai, Karagam and Mylattam.

Several people, who could not visit their native towns or villages, took their children to the venue to show them traditional ways of Pongal celebrations. “The organizers allowed individuals to participate in games like pambaram and tug of war. This is better than children sitting in front of the television the whole day,” said D Sriram, who brought five children from his family. A livestock exhibition was also conducted at the venue.

People living in the western parts of the district brought their children to the Madeshwaran temple opposite to the Aavin office on Thadagam Road. They witnessed hundreds of dairy farmers bringing their cows in a long procession to the temple to offer their prayers. Many of the cows were decorated with vermillion and sandal paste rubbed on their back and forehead. Large “Nandhi” idol on the temple was also decked with sandal, turmeric and several tonnes of fruits.

Families with cows decorated their cattle and offered prayers to them, thanking them for the livelihood and milk they provide and praying for their fertility.

Farmers began the day by giving their cows and calves a bath early in the morning, rubbing the cow and bull’s bodies with turmeric and kumkum and painting the bulls’ horns in colours of red, orange and blue. “While we wrap silk scarves on bull’s horns, we put them on cows, as we believe silk bring bountiful prosperity to cattle,” said T Murugan, a farmer from Thondamuthur.

Thiruvananthapuram: Students from the 1970 batch of College of Engineering, Trivandrum are celebrating their alumni’s golden jubilee year. The celebration, named Mahasangamam , began with a ‘ Gurupooja ’ where former professors of CET were honoured. The celebrations were inaugurated by former Isro chairman G Madhavan Nair at 3pm on Thursday.

“The contribution of our batch — in terms of academics, sports and cultural activities — were significant to the growth of CET as a pioneering educational institution in our country. So instead of merely celebrating the golden jubilee year of our batch, we thought of doing something unique and productive for our college. Only through such deeds we can be remembered by our college,” said S Gopakumar, an alumnus of the batch.

On July 25, CET will honour these students at the college. “As a part of the celebration, we decided to sponsor the studies of students belonging to economically-weaker sections of the society and support researches that are conducted for recycling plastic. Along with that, we are suggesting the reuse of debris from Maradu flat demolition to build blocks, interlocking tiles and fences,” he said.

The batchmates will stay at a resort in Kovalam with their families to reminisce and relive their college days. “All of us are well over 72 and now we are guided by memories. The college administration told us that they are ready to give us a stage every month as the college is also celebrating its 80th year. We will be organizing programmes every month along with other alumni associations, which will be beneficial to students as well as the faculty,” he said. Out of 240 students belonging to five different batches of 1970, only 180 are alive.

“We booked Valecha and Khiyani on the complaint of Bhaktani’s mother Lajvanti, who alleged that the accused were pressurizing Bhaktani for the recovery of the interest on Rs 60,000 loan he had taken from them,” said an official from Pradyumannagar police station.

According to Lajvanti’s complaint, both Valecha and Khiyani had threatened to kill Bhaktani, if he did not pay the amount. This prompted Lajvanti to approach the police.

“When Lajvanti went to Pradyumannagar police station along with Bhaktani, both Valecha and Khiyani came after her and pressurized her not to lodge the complaint against them on October 10 last year. It was at this time that Bhaktani took out an acid bottle from the boot of his two-wheeler and consumed its content,” added the official.

Meanwhile, the cops have launched a manhunt for Velecha and Khiyani.

Representational image

MUZAFFARNAGAR: Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the cases of violence during the anti-CAA protests have booked 33 jailed protestors for allegedly provoking children to throw stones at policemen during the clashes. The probe agency has invoked sections of Juvenile Justice (Care And Protection of Children) Act, 2015 against the accused. All the 33 accused were earlier charged under various sections of the IPC and sent to jail.

Several new offences committed against children, which are so far not adequately covered under any other law, are included in the

Juvenile Justice (Care And Protection of Children) Act, 2015. These include use of children by militant groups, sale and procurement of children for any purpose including illegal adoption and offences against disabled children.

The SIT got the permission to slap the additional charge on the 33 accused from chief judicial magistrate Ravikant Yadav’s court.

“SIT has added an extra section of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, against 33 offenders of the violence,” said Wakar Ahmad, a lawyer who is fighting cases of some of the accused of the violence which erupted on December 20 last year in Muzaffarnagar.

During the clashes, several minors were seen throwing stones at the policemen and vandalizing properties.

According to police, as many as 47 cases were registered at Nagar Kotwali and Civil Lines police stations, in which more than 250 people were named. Police have arrested more than 80 people so far in the matter.

Another senior lawyer Chandraveer Singh said that the sections of the Juvenile Act, 2015 were invoked as there was no such provision in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to book people for such offences.

Jana Sena Party chief Pawan Kalyan. (ANI photo)

VIJAYAWADA: Extending support to BJP on the National Register of Citizens and Citizenship Amendment Act, Jana Sena president Pawan Kalyan on Thursday said political parties were creating fear among people.

He said there was no threat to Indian Muslims with the new laws initiated by the Centre. Speaking to media here on Thursday, Pawan said the Citizenship Amendment Act was brought to give citizenship to minorities persecuted in neighbouring countries. “India was never declared as a Hindu nation. Hindu minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh are facing torture and the CAA has been brought to provide citizenship to such people who migrated to India under fear,” said Pawan.

Kalyan said there was no truth that Indian Muslims would lose citizenship with the CAA and NRC. He said that the controversy about the CAA and NRC was unnecessary.

The Jana Sena president said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah were taking the nation into growth corridor. Explaining his U-turn on his fight against the BJP-led Centre on the Special Category Status (SCS), Pawan said the TDP leadership had committed a blunder by agreeing to the special package to ignore the SCS.

Pawan also criticized YSRC’s three-capital cities theory saying that no one would call a city as capital because it hosts the high court. He said it was a diversionary tactic.

He said that he had found fault with the TDP regime when it pooled 33,000 acre for the capital city. Pawan promised to uproot casteism from politics in the state. He said Jana Sena was ready to work with BJP .

303,['17/01/2020'],Silver jubilee of Yuva Mahotsav to witness new platforms for talent,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Margao: The 25th edition of Goa Yuva Mahotsav organised by Konkani Bhasha Mandal (KBM), which will kick off on Friday at Ravindra Bhavan in Margao, will witness a mammoth congregation of youngsters from across the state. Chief minister Pramod Sawant will be the chief guest at the inaugural session to be held at 11.30am.

KBM’s Anwesha Singbal said that altogether 39 educational institutions have registered for the 3-day event. “While there will be a direct participation of over 2,500 youth, we expect a crowd of over 10,000 young people,” she said.

As this year marks the festival’s silver jubilee, the organisers have introduced a new programme ‘Yuva Nakhetra’ which will see past participants of the Mahotsav unleash their talents, it was informed.

Pradip Kakodkar, a chartered accountant, who had participated in several such festivals since its inception, says the event provides participants a new perspective about Goa’s rich social and cultural heritage. “Looking back, I can say with pride that only after stepping on the stage of Goa Yuva Mahotsav, I got a better understanding and developed affection towards the diverse aspects of Goa’s vibrant culture, history, heritage, folk art, etc,” Kakodkar said.

Reminiscing about the various agitations he participated in over the years, along with his co-participants at the mahotsav, Kakodkar points out to one such protest staged by Goa Hitrakhan Manch, where they cornered and confronted the then post master general into withdrawing a circular that would have harmed the prospects of Goans seeking employment in the postal service. “I remember the post master general called me up at 2am to say that she is withdrawing the circular,” Kakodkar says.

Nevertheless, the mahotsav has also attracted criticism, particularly from veterans of the Konkani movement. They argue that while the mahotsavs of late have lent a celebratory dimension to the Konkani movement, these have failed to build a strong youth force that would take to the streets to fight for the cause of Konkani as and when needed.

Dinesh Manerkar, who was closely associated with the event during its initial years, counters the criticism. “The youth festival has succeeded for the last 24 years in keeping the talents of Goan youth alive. Today’s educational system is so rigid that students are burdened with their internal exams and attendance,” he says.

“The Yuva Mahotsav has no doubt created a revolution,” Kakodkar says, “but the event should result in creating a strong young leadership that will take up the issues concerning Goa long after the curtains are drawn on the event.”

Panaji: Around 750kg of wet waste and 1,500kg of dry waste is generated every day of the Lokotsav. Keeping in mind the volume of waste generated, this year, the festival has introduced a waste management project in a step towards solving the garbage issue.

Here, the wet waste is directly fed into the processor unit built into a mobile van to be processed into organic material, while the dry waste is segregated into seven categories before being handed over to the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP).

“This is an attempt at making the festival a zero-waste event. The wet waste will be converted into compost to be distributed among farmers through the directorate of agriculture,” said Ashok Parab, deputy director, directorate of art and culture (DAC).

Having bagged the event-planning contract this year, Fusion Events suggested to the DAC to make the festival a zero-waste event. The event management team then reached out to Indore-based Swaaha Resource Management Pvt Ltd to execute the project.

The team has executed this project at various events in Indore. “The biggest event, however, was the Bohra-community festival Ashara Mubaraka in 2018, wherein we processed 25 tonnes of wet waste per day on site. Over the course of the 10-day festival, 250 tonnes of organic waste was converted into compost. This was then handed over to the farmers of the Bohra community,” said Rohit Aggarwal, director, Swaaha. The mobile processor unit has a capacity of processing 2,000kg of wet waste per day in eight-hour shifts. At the Lokotsav, the unit operates for two to three hours per day to process the 750-odd kg wet waste into compost.

The dry waste is segregated into plastic bottles, glass bottles, polythene bags, paper cups, newspapers, cardboard, tetra packs and tin cans. Around five people segregate dry waste while one person manages the mobile wet waste processor.

“A truck from CCP comes to the festival venue twice a day to collect the segregated dry waste,” Aggarwal said.

At around 4pm on Wednesday, Himanshu Gohel, a friend of Chavda, had come to the police chowky to hand him tickets for the India-Australia one-day match to be held on January 17, when a bullet from Chavda’s firearm hit him accidentally and he died from the injury.

MUZAFFARNAGAR: A UP police constable, who joined the state police force nine years ago, allegedly committed suicide late night on Wednesday in Shamli district. His body was found hanging from a tree in Shamli’s Police Lines by another on-duty constable.

The deceased constable – Harendra – allegedly committed suicide over a family discord. However, a probe has been set up and the reason behind his death is being investigated. When informed, his Meerut-based family went into a state of shock.

According to sources, a security guard patrolling Police Lines late night on Wednesday, found the body hanging from a tree. He alerted his superiors, who rushed to the spot and sent the body for postmortem, after identifying him as constable Harendra of village Laluhera in Meerut, and posted in Shamli district.

According to Shamli SP Veenit Jaiswal, “Based on information we have received, he was taken to the district hospital where he was declared brought dead. His family was informed and his body sent for postmortem.” He added, “It appears that a family dispute was behind the suicide.”

COIMBATORE: Farmers in the first zone of irrigation of Parambikulam Aliyar Project (PAP), which includes Coimbatore and Tirupur, have raised concerns as water meant for the region has been opened for Uppar Dam . This would result in insufficient water for crops in their zone, they said.

Farmers from the first zone said they have sown crops such as groundnut and shallots which were now ready to receive water. At this juncture, the state, which had promised four rounds of water to be released for the first zone, has now released water to Uppar Dam, they said. This would eat into their share of water, farmers said.

S Paramasivam, a representative of Tamil Nadu Farmers Association from Tirupur, said around 1lakh acres of land have been cultivated in the first zone. This includes areas such as Pollachi, Kinathukkadavu, Udumalapet, Madathukkulam, Kangeyam and Palladam. Around 25,000 farmers, most of whom are small and marginal, cultivate in this region, he said.

“Groundnut has been sown. Shallots have sprouted. At this juncture the state has let water to Uppar Dam. This would mean there would be no sufficient water for this region,” he said.

Paramasivam said there was enough water only for the first PAP zone and the state had announced four rounds of water would be opened from January 27. “They had said only surplus water would be given to Uppar Dam. But now they are giving them water meant for this region,” he said.

When contacted, a senior official attached to the Parambikulam Aliyar Project said they had given water to Uppar Dam after farmers from that region had represented to the state. They have so far been given around 210mcft of water to Uppar Dam. “Farmers in PAP zone one would be given 7,600mcft water as announced. They would get sufficient water,” the official added.

While the farmers had called for a protest on Friday at the Pollachi PAP office, the water opened from Tirumoorthy Dam to Uppar Dam was stopped on Thursday evening. So the farmers said they have called off the protest.

East Coast Railways spokesperson Jyoti Prakash Mishra talks to Ashok Pradhan about Thursday’s accident and more .

n What caused the train to derail?

An inquiry has been ordered. The Commissioner of Railway Safety will probe into it. The inquiry will start on Saturday. Any member of public who has any information relating to the accident can share the details with the inquiry authorities. The Commissioner of Railway Safety is an autonomous organization under the administrative control of the ministry of civil aviation.

n Any preliminary findings given that it’s a case of a running train hitting a stationary train?

The statutory inquiry will unravel the exact reasons. But as immediate response, pending the inquiry, the Indian Railways suspended four personnel: the train driver, assistant driver, the station master of Nergundi besides the goods train guard. This move is meant to ensure free and fair inquiry and fixing of responsibility. The probe will find answer to all questions. It would be improper to jump into any conclusion before that.

n What is the extent of damage and train services affected?

Eight coaches and the engine were derailed. The injured were immediately shifted to SCB Medical College and Hospital. Locals played good Samaritans in reaching out to the affected people and in shifting them. Five trains were diverted. Repair of the damaged track was done on a war-footing. The running of trains has normalised on the route.

n The latest incident seems recurrence of a similar mishap on Sept 29, 2016 near Cuttack?

Every accident has its own reasons. It would be unfair to compare any two incidents. In 2016, a passenger train (Bhubaneswar-Bhadrak DMU) had hit a stationary goods train near Cuttack. That incident took place around 4 pm. This incident has happened in the morning.

n Are you indicating at the visibility problem due to fog this time?

I am not indicating to anything. Only thing is, two incidents can’t be compared. Let the probe find it out. I can’t either indicate or ignore anything. That’s not possible without proper inquiry by the appropriate authorities.

n Of late, there seems to too many incidents within East Coast Railway area starting with a major mishap on January 22, 2017 near Rayagada...

The year 2019 was largely incident free. There was an incident of burning of some train coaches (Puri-Hatia Tapaswni Express) in Puri station in March last year when the train was empty. It was the handiwork of miscreants, not an accident. A robust safety drive is in force. We will further revisit and strengthen wherever there is scope. Safety is of paramount importance to the railways. For every single incident, small or big, responsibility is fixed, caused identified and corrective measures taken.

n There are also many incidents of fire in premium trains. Can you tell us about the precautions undertaken?

There were some cases of fire, not just in ECoR but in other parts. After technical inputs regarding the same, it has been corrected. There is no fire incident in recent months. The railways is alert.

According to its announcement, the company started the drive against defaulting commercial establishments in the morning in its 247 sections under 20 distribution divisions. Around 13,411 commercial consumers were covered by 533 special disconnection squads, said a Cesu source.

“This does not include online payments which will be known on Friday. We have also received complaints from around 3,971 consumers on bill revision. As many as 2,346 consumers have availed instalment facilities for paying arrears,” said Cesu CEO Arun Bothra in a press statement.

He said the company has advised all its field units to keep the collection counters open from early morning to late evening for allowing the consumers to pay their arrears. Commercial consumers of Saheed Nagar and Baramunda have cleared their arrears in full on the first day of drive itself, he added.

Bothra said Cesu has decided to conduct its disconnection drive in a phased manner. The company will target defaulting commercial and high value customers only in the first phase. “The second phase of disconnection drive will focus on affluent and high value domestic consumers keeping in view huge outstanding arrears. In the third phase, all other consumers will be covered. It will specially focus on consumers who have not paid electricity dues for years together,” he added.

People in Dhenkanal district opposed the move of the Cesu. The locals said the company should not take this extreme step when the students are preparing for their upcoming examinations. Some villagers of Gurujang in Khurda district had argued with the Cesu officials while the electricians were trying to disconnect electricity supply to a betel shop. “The shop has arrears of Rs 21,000. The owner has given this shop to me to run. The company had given notice four days ago and snapped the power supply today,” said Susant Das, the shopkeeper.

Bhubaneswar: The wife of city-based businessman Parvinder Pal Singh, who was assaulted by local youths in Laxmisagar area, alleged that some people visited their house late on Wednesday night, leaving them scared. The visitors included Bhubaneswar Central MLA Ananta Narayan Jena and Khurda deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Anup Kanungo among others. Ananta, however, said he went to the house to express solidarity with the family and to give them assurance about their safety.

“It was about 1.30 am. We were sleeping. Suddenly there was loud banging on the door. We got so scared we did not open the door. They kept on banging for a long time,” said Kamaljit, wife of Parvinder. “If they had come to show their sympathy they could have come in the evening. What was the point of coming after midnight?” she asked. At the time of the incident the couple were there along with their three children.

She said the people again visited their house on Wednesday morning and said they are with the family. “We came to know that those who assaulted my husband got bail on Wednesday night. How can we trust them?” she asked.

Parvinder also expressed surprise as the accused got bail so easily. “I was assaulted in front of the police. They hit me with a big stone. I am alive today by god’s grace. It was a clear case of attempt to murder. We feel there is no justice in this land,” Parvinder said.

Dubbing his visit as a courtesy call, the Bhubaneswar Central legislator said, “It was a courtesy call as he is a resident of my constituency and it is my duty to stand with the family in difficult time.”

The incident took a political turn when opposition Congress and BJP criticised the state government and the police for favouring the accused. BJP leader Jagannath Pradhan lodged a complaint at Laxmisagar police station against the MLA and the DSP, alleging that both visited Parvinder’s house late on Wednesday night to threaten the family.

Panaji: With the Zilla Panchayat elections being announced, Goa Forward Party called for all anti-BJP forces, including the Congress party to unite and take on the BJP in the state. While publicly reaching out to the Congress party, GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that the party’s leadership would meet and chalk out the strategy for the ZP polls, which will be fought on party lines.

“We will meet tomorrow and take a proper decision. I am talking about not dividing the anti-BJP vote. We have to do business with the Congress,” said Sardesai. He was speaking at the inauguration of the Dr. Jack de Sequeira square at Merces junction.

GFP had recently joined hands with the Congress, MGP and independent MLA Rohan Khaunte while moving an adjournment motion calling for a discussion on diversion of water from river Mhadei in the state legislative assembly. This is the second overture being made by GFP towards the Congress even through the former remains a member of the NDA alliance at the Centre.

Congress party said that it would be happy to align with a trusted partner which have not joined hands with BJP. “We want a trusted alliance. We do not want to align with anyone who in interested in opportunistic politics, those who have not helped BJP to come to power,” said state Congress president Girish Chodankar.

Chodankar made it clear that the door remained closed for GFP at this moment, the exact opposite of what Sardesai wants.

“Most Goans want the opposition to be united. We are not going to be cannibalistic by creating confusion and allowing the BJP to win. Everybody who is opposed to this anti-people government should be brought under one umbrella but the responsibility for this lies with the Congress because it is the principal opposition party,” Sardesai said.

GFP appears to be in two minds about contesting the ZP elections on party lines with party insiders still worried about a backlash from voters. GFP, which won three seats in the 2017 state assembly elections on an anti-BJP plank, quickly chose to support the BJP government, a move seen as betrayal by many of the voters.

“Politicization of the local self-government bodies should be avoided, but the question is whether this view still stands,” said Sardesai when asked whether the party was keen on contesting the ZP elections on party lines.

MUMBAI: With an angry Congress exerting pressure, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday withdrew his statements made a day before that former PM Indira Gandhi had met gangster Karim Lala at Pydhonie.

“I am taking back my words if someone feels hurt by my statements,” the Sena MP told media on Thursday after Congress ministers Balasaheb Thorat and Ashok Chavan lashed out. “Raut should avoid making such irresponsible and irrelevant statements and respect our leaders… We have spoken to the CM,” said Thorat. Going a step further, Chavan said his party is “ready to pay whatever price required”, but will not tolerate comments against the late PM.

Later, Sena scion Aaditya Thackeray sought to put a lid on the row, saying Sena founder Bal Thackeray had immense respect for Indira Gandhi and Raut’s statement was taken out of context.

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut ’s demand that Udayanraje Bhosale should provide evidence of being a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj evoked sharp reactions in parts of western Maharashtra; with Satara observing total bandh on Thursday.

Satara city wore a deserted look with markets, shops, educational institutions staying closed for the day. Heavy police bandobast was seen at all entry points of Satara and in the city. The bandh crippled daily life in Satara as all transport activities, petrol pumps and shops remaining closed.

Supporters of former MP Udayanraje Bhosale, who is the 13th descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, moved around the city. BJP workers gathered at Moti chowk in the morning. They carried placards slamming Raut and NCP legislator Jitendra Avhad and demanded unconditional apology from them.

BJP activists and supporters of Udayanraje also held demonstrations in Sangli, Solapur and Ahmednagar districts.

In the meantime, Sambhaji Bhide of Shivpratishthan Hindustan has given a call for a bandh in Sangli on Friday. Talking to the media, Bhide condemned Raut and urged chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to take action against him.

Bhide warned that similar bandh would be observed all over Maharashtra if action is not taken against Raut and he does not withdraw his statement.

BJP spokesperson Ram Kadam has demanded registration of offence against Raut. In a letter to the home minister, Kadam has said that Raut’s statement has hurt sentiments of the people of Maharashtra.

Raut has also upset workers of Congress and NCP with his statements on former prime minister Indira Gandhi and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. Raut allegedly said Gandhi used to meet underworld don Karim Lala and described Pawar as stepney (the spare tire in a car).

NCP workers, however, were not open in their rebellion considering the current political setup. A top NCP leader said on the condition of anonymity that Raut’s remarks on Pawar were humiliating.

This is the second time that Raut has targetted Bhosale. Earlier, he had asked the descendants of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to clarify their stand on the controversial book by a BJP member. After furore, the book has now been withdrawn.

Kolhapur: The district has emerged as an oasis for Congress with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray finally respecting the request of local Congress functionaries to appoint minister for state for home Satej Patil guardian minister of Kolhapur .

Patil, who is also president of Kolhapur district Congress, is credited for party’s performance in the 2019 assembly elections. He was appointed president few days ahead of the assembly polls following Prakash Awade’s resignation.

Now, Congress workers believe that it was Patil’s leadership that rejuvenated the party in the district as it went on to win four seats in 2019 whereas in 2014 it has even failed to open the account.

This time around Congress emerged as the strongest party in the district with all other parties suffered defeat. Of the seven seats, Sena managed to win only one seat while BJP was unable to win a single seat. NCP managed to retain its two seats in the election.

Performance of the grand old party in Kolhapur assumes significance as it failed to improve in other western Maharashtra district, including Pune, Satara, Sangli and Solapur where it has senior functionaries like Prithviraj Chavan, Sushilkumar Shinde and Vishwajeet Kadam.

Earlier, Kolhapur district witnessed severe battle for the post of guardian minister between NCP’s Hasan Mushrif and Patil as both parties were looking for expanding their party base.

Sources in Congress said that Patil’s appointment is significant in view of the election to Kolhapur Municipal Corporation later this year.

The police said that they sent a government panch with the complainant to meet the forest official at a hotel in Panhala. The voice recorded during the meeting confirmed that someone demanded bribe from him. “Based on this, we set up a trap and the complainant met the forest official and gave him Rs 1,000. However, he did not accept the money and returned it. We immediately rushed to the spot and nabbed the forest official. However, during investigation, we found that the voice recorded in hotel was different than the voice of the forest official.

Kolhapur: Safety audit of 45 major bridges that were submerged during the recent floods in Kolhapur and Sangli districts is in the final stage and a report will soon be submitted to the government.

Almost all major and minor bridges — including those on Pune-Bangalore National Highway, Kolhapur-Ratnagiri Road, Kolhapur-Sangli Road, Kolhapur-Gaganbawada and Kolhapur-Radhanagari road — were submerged in floodwater last year.

There are 479 bridges in Kolhapur district while in Sangli the number is 452. The bridges have been built over Panchganga and Warna rivers. After floodwater receded, a primary safety audit of was conducted and they were open for traffic after confirming that they are safe.

According to a public works department (PWD) official, the department did not have adequate instruments and machines to test the safety of these bridges.

“The heavy flow of water, wooden logs, branches of trees and other material that was flowing in the rivers during flood might have damaged the bridges. Thus, safety audit was a must. Apart from this, there was a possibility that the impact of landslide, rise of water level above the bridge, soil erosion during floods might have impacted the strength of the bridges” the official said.

“We then decided to conduct safety audit of major bridges from Kolhapur and Sangli district that have maximum traffic load and are important for communication. We called a team of expert teachers and students from IIT-Chennai and requested them to conduct the safety audit of 45 bridges using standard equipment,” he added.

The audit is in the final phase now. “The team is now checking the strength of the bridges using ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle), laser beams, video cameras and other instruments. The team will submit us report in details after completing the work,” the official said.

“Based on the report we will take up the repair work of the damaged part of the bridges if any is found during the audit. We will implement all suggestions that the team will make in its report,” he said.

Bombay high court

MUMBAI: Referring to the plight of patients at the twin Wadia hospitals in Parel due to freeze of grants, the Bombay high court on Thursday slammed the state government, saying it has money to build Dr B R Ambedkar’s statue, but not to spend on the poor and middle class who cannot afford treatment at ‘star’ hospitals.

The comment came a day after the state cabinet raised the cost of the Ambedkar memorial project at Dadar’s Indu Mills by Rs 300 crore, taking it to Rs 1,070 crore, to account for a 100ft increase in the icon’s statue. “For that (statue), money is there, but the same people Ambedkar represented all his life can die. They need medical aid or statues?” asked the bench of Justices Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Riyaz Chagla while hearing a public interest litigation to release grants by the state and BMC to the Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital and Bai Jerbai Wadia Hospital for Children. While the state and BMC share 50% of the grant to the maternity hospital, BMC funds 85% of the grant to the children’s hospital.

Advocate Girish Godbole, for the state government, said the finance department has sanctioned Rs 24 crore from the contingent fund and it will be given in lumpsum within three weeks.

“This is an eyewash. This, to materialize, will take months. Tomorrow this amount should be released,” said Justice Dharmadhikari, adding that otherwise, right from the state chief secretary to the deputy secretary, “we will parade them here (in court). You want that?”

Godbole also said the government will scrutinise if the maternity hospital’s other claims are genuine and added that in “the administration some are drawing salary from the two establishments”. He also said “amounts claimed are inflated”. The judges questioned what officials of the public health department, when it was part of the trust, were doing. Senior advocate Rafiq Dada, for the hospitals, said all accounts are audited. “They (officials) used to come to meet you (Wadia) for a cup of tea,” said Justice Dharmadhikari.

Dada said salaries are not paid. He said there are 300 critical beds and a total of 800 beds in both hospitals. “Critical patients are not being admitted. It is very distressing.” The judges said they thought that “when there are new faces as political bosses, all this would stop”. They said non-release of grants led to the trustees taking measures to refuse admissions and discharge patients. “This is disgusting. Why should anybody who is not part of the dispute suffer? In the commercial capital, (the) poor strata of society is refused admission at a charitable hospital in which the state is a partner,” Justice Dharmadhikari said.

The judges then observed that the government is competing to build a statue of Ambedkar which is taller that of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. They questioned if by looking at the statues, hunger, physical ailments and other miseries would be removed. They didn’t spare CM Uddhav Thackeray, who on Wednesday launched the first girder of the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link. “You have time to inaugurate schemes…time to go and inaugurate a bridge which is yet to be built. We are thankful to the CM for finding time to meet them (all stakeholders),” Justice Dharmadhikari said, also asking whether the court should acknowledge it in the order.

The judges said that in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, there are reports of children being underfed and dying. “This should be the scenario in Maharashtra? That too in the commercial capital of India?” Justice Dharmadhikari asked.

BMC’s advocate Suresh Pakale said its balance payment is over Rs 14 crore towards the children’s hospital, and it will release it. But Dada said the BMC owes it “more than Rs 100 crore.” On Friday, the state government will inform when the amount will be disbursed. “Common man you can take for a ride. Not us,” said Justice Dharmadhikari.

“A total of 18 witnesses were examined and based on the available evidence and statements the court awarded life sentence to Katale. The court also slapped a fine of Rs 5,000 and simple imprisonment of six months if he fails to pay the fine,” public prosecutor Manjusha Patil said.

325,['17/01/2020'],Ganjam admin to help boy suffering from rare skin disease,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Berhampur: The Ganjam district administration has stepped in for treatment to a 10-year-old boy of Gothagaon in Sheragada block, 50 km from here. He is suffering from a rare skin disease from his birth.

Jagannath, son of Prabhakar Pradhan, a farmer, has dry and dark patches in the skin. He is dubbed as ‘human snake’ as his skin is full of scales. The skin disorder, ichthyosis, is a genetic disease, said a doctor.

District collector Vijay Amruta Kulange, went to his home late on Wednesday and discussed with his parents about the ailment and sanctioned Rs 10,000 from the district Red Cross fund for initial treatment. Earlier they had provided Rs 5,000.

“We have advised his parents to take him to All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), Bhubaneswar, for his better treatment. A team of doctors will coordinate to refer him to AIIMS,” he said. If necessary, he will be treated in a private hospital. The expenses will be provided from the chief minister’s relief fund, he said.

Chief district medical officer (CDMO) B K Panigrahy said he is undergoing treatment in the City Hospital here and his condition is stable.

Ichthyosis is a chronic skin disease that is characterised by thick, dry and rough patches on the skin. Experts said this type of skin disease affects less than one in three lakh people. Ichthyosis is hereditary but there are also acquired forms of the disorder, said an expert.

Sushama Pradhan, mother of Jagannath, said he feels pain frequently. “We apply moisturiser, oil and other medicines four to five times a day, but in vain,” she said. He studies in Class III in a local school. “But he is reluctant to go to the school as he is booed as human snake by others,” she said.

“We got him treated in different hospitals, including MKCG Medical College and Hospital here. But the disease is yet to be cured,” said his father.

Jagannath is his youngest son while other two sons aged 12 and 14 are doing fine. His six children — two sons and four daughters — had died earlier due to the rare skin disease, family sources said. “While one of my daughters, suffering from this disease, lived four years, other five children died within a year,” said Sushama.

326,['17/01/2020'],Bengaluru: Where timepieces are a treat to watch,"This story is from January 17, 2020

The India International Watch and Clock Fair was inaugurated at Gayatri Vihar on Thursday

BENGALURU: Time, it appears, is out of the joint at India International Watch and Clock Fair under way in Bengaluru. But that is not only because the hands of thousands of clocks and watches show different hours, but also due to the mindboggling varieties on display.

From German-made grandfather clocks to smartwatches, from a watch with sparkling diamond petals resembling a flower to chameleon-like collections, from those with British-era stamps and coins as dials to ones with pure gold dials and straps, the fair showcases over 50,000 styles and designs from over 100 brands.

The event is happening at a time when the watch industry itself is at the crossroads. With Apple, which isn’t a watch company, is leading the world in watch sales, the core companies in the sector have been discussing opportunities of growth in the new scenario.

“All answers lie in the fundamental proposition that people don’t buy products just because they are good. They buy brands they believe in. So we need to build brands, nurture and grow them... India has the capability to build every component of a watch. While cost of labour is growing in other countries, we see an opportunity to build a watch manufacturing or a global service centre,” said Johnson Verghese, managing director, Fossil India.

The four-day event kicked off at Gayatri Vihar, Palace Grounds on Thursday. It’s open from 10am to 7pm. Held every two years, the ‘festival of time’ has come back to Bengaluru for the second time after a gap of 12 years.

At Jaipur Watch Company’s stall, the most prized possessions are models that are hand-engraved. “Earlier, such engravings were seen only on swords and weapons of maharajas. When I happened to meet some artisans who could do that in Udaipur, I took their help to customise the same for watches,” said Gaurav Mehta, founder of Jaipur Watch Company. These watches take nearly four months to make.

Gaurav’s customers include celebrities and star hotels. For Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he made a customised watch with the leader’s face engraved on it. The accessory was gifted to the PM by a politician. Among Gaurav’s collections are also pure gold watches worth Rs 3.5 lakh. The most expensive one is the sparkling flower watch, which has diamond-studded petals that move like real flowers around the dial. While the watch with real diamonds cost Rs 12.5 lakh, the one on display, with American diamonds, is worth Rs 4.5 lakh.

Grandfather clocks imported from Germany and cuckoo clocks from Korea are other major attractions. “While there was a trend of returning to mechanical watches, I wanted to do the same with clocks. I decided to get into the business of grandfather clocks from German company Hermle,” said Sanjan B Hasija of Skylark Trading Co.

On display are clocks ranging from Rs 25,000-Rs 5 lakh.

327,['17/01/2020'],NDA to fight assembly polls under Bihar CM NitishKumar: Ami​t Shah,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Amit Shah

VAISHALI GARH: Union home minister Ami t Shah here on Thursday said the NDA would fight the coming assembly election in Bihar under the leadership of chief minister Nitish Kumar.

Shah’s categorical statement, made in his first public speech in the state since last year’s Lok Sabha polls, is set to put at rest speculation about who would lead the NDA in the Bihar election. This comes close on the heels of a section of BJP leaders dropping hints about a change of leadership in the NDA, despite Shah’s earlier statement projecting Nitish as the ruling alliance’s CM face.

Speaking at well-attended pro-CAA rally, first by any top BJP leader in the state, Shah said, “BJP aur JD(U) ka gathbandhan atoot hai. The NDA government at the Centre is under PM Narendra Modi, while the state is under CM Nitish Kumar ji).”

The BJP national president, in a scathing attack on RJD, said, “The era of lantern (RJD’s poll symbol) is over. Humne pradesh ko lalten yug see LED yug mein laya hai.” Without naming RJD chief Lalu Prasad, he added, “Wo jail mein sapna dekh rahen hain. Unka apna CM banane ka sapna pura nahi hoga.”

Shah was generous in his praise for Nitish and gave the CM all credit for transforming the state from “jungle raj” to “janta raj”. He said Bihar’s growth rate was a meagre 3% when it was under RJD rule. “Now in 2020, the state’s growth rate is 11%,” he added.

Shah said the NDA government in the state would now work for providing piped drinking water to every household in the next five years. He added, “Electricity and gas connections have already been given to all households.”

Referring to the CAA, the home minister said, “I am overwhelmed by the response from Bihar. I have addressed a series of meetings, but Bihar is where I have got the maximum support on the CAA.” He added, “The CAA is all about giving citizenship to all those Hindus, Jains, Christians and Sikhs who faced religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.”

Shah said Muslims in the country need not worry about losing their citizenship. “Rumours are being spread and people are being misled on the issue,” he remarked, adding, “Opposition parties are doing this to people, especially Muslims, for political gains.” “Mat (vote) ke lalach mein mati (wisdom) kho diye hain,” he said.

The home minister accused 'tukde tukde gang' (opposition leaders) of “toeing the line” of Pakistan PM Imran Khan by “orchestrating violence” in the first three-four days of the passing of the CAA by Parliament. He warned, “Those who shout slogans like Bharat tere tukde honge will be taught a lesson.""

Accusing Congress of adopting double standards on the CAA, Shah said the Congress in Rajasthan promised citizenship to such people in its election manifesto. “Jab wo bole toh thik aur hum bole to galat. Ye kahan ka nyay hai?” he asked.

In his 25-minute speech, Shah targeted Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal, Mamta Banerjee and Lalu Prasad for their “vote bank politics”. Holding Congress responsible for the plight of hundreds of refugees, he said the Indian government at the time of Partition did not take care of the rights of the lakhs of people who willingly stayed back in East and West Pakistan.

“While the number of minorities in Pakistan decreased, the population of minorities in India increased manifold,” Shah said, adding, “India never talked of Hindu Rashtra because of which all sects and religions flourished here.”

On the issue of building a temple at Ayodhya, Shah said a “sky-touching temple of Ram Lala” will be built there in the next four months. He highlighted the NDA government’s success in settling the issues of Article 370 and 35A in Jammu & Kashmir.

Illustration used for representational purpose

BENGALURU: A murder convict and a woman homeguard who hatched a plan to extort money from a woman sub-inspector from Vidyaranyapura police station landed behind bars on Wednesday.

Ramu alias Chool Ramu, 35, called the woman cop on January 7 night and abused her, saying they had her nude pictures. He demanded she pay him Rs 1 lakh, failing which he would defame her. The SI rebuked the caller and filed a complaint.

During investigation, it was revealed that the phone call was made by Ramu, a history-sheeter and murder convict who had been released after seven years in jail.

Sleuths discovered that the SIM card was registered in homeguard Puttamma’s name. They took the duo into custody and questioned them. It turned out that Puttamma, 32, was the one who made Ramu call the woman sub-inspector.

Police said Puttamma was upset with the SI because the latter would burden her with work. She used Ramu, who she had met four years ago when she was deputed in Parappana Agrahara prison, where he was serving a murder term.

Sleuths suspect Puttamma, who is married, had a relationship with Ramu after he came out of prison.

329,['17/01/2020'],May support BJP if assembly gets Jack’s statue: Vijai,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Panaji: Goa Forward Party (GFP) on Thursday challenged the 10 MLAs who switched over from the Congress to the BJP to convince the state government to install a life-size statue of Dr Jack de Sequeira in the state legislative assembly complex.

GFP president Vijai Sardesai, who inaugurated the Dr Jack de Sequeira Square at Merces junction, said that he was willing to support the BJP government if the statue was installed in the complex. “We failed to put up the statue of Dr Jack de Sequeira in the assembly, which we wanted to do. Now, the 10 MLAs who have gone to the BJP (from the Congress) we pray that they do it at least,” Sardesai said.

The former deputy chief minister said that when GFP was part of the state government, Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate was in favour of the statue being put up in the assembly complex.

“These 10 MLAs should prove me wrong. If they do that then we may even think of supporting the present government,” said Sardesai.

Sardesai made the statement in the presence of St Cruz MLA Tony Fernandes who is one of the MLAs to switch over from the Congress to the BJP. “Dr Jack de Sequeira fought to protect Goa’s identity. I will propose to our government to beautify the roads around this square,” was all that Fernandes said.

The square at Merces has been built on land provided by the government when Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar was a minister. The site has been developed by the Merces Konkani Kala Kendre.

Sardesai also slammed the government headed by chief minister Pramod Sawant by stating that the BJP government was trying to rewrite history in the state.

“If not for the opinion poll, the chief minister would have been a chairman of a zilla parishad, nothing more. People are trying to rewrite history. Today you cannot say that Nehru did not do anything for Goa. It is Jawaharlal Nehru who laid the path for the Opinion Poll, which is Independent India’s only referendum. Just because those who run the country like it, you cannot criticise Nehru,” he said.

Bhubaneswar: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday laid foundation stone of the heritage and infrastructure projects in Puri during his visit to the pilgrim town. He also offered prayers at the Jagannath Temple and reviewed the heritage corridor project.

“I am always happy to visit Shree Jagannath Mandir and pray for welfare of people of our state. You will see the projects surrounding the temple will be very beautiful,” Naveen told reporters after visiting the shrine.

Though the chief minister visits the 12th century shrine every year on January 1, this year he could not visit as he was mourning the death of his brother-in-law Sonny Mehta.

Projects for which foundation stones were laid include the Shree Setu project, Jagannath Ballav Pilgrim Centre, multi-level car parking and redevelopment of municipal market complex under the Abadha scheme. Foundation was also laid for three other projects which will not be part of the Abadha scheme. The Shree Setu Project is a 2.3-km link that will connect the NH-316 with the Grand Road through a trumpet bridge bypassing the town. The link, which will ease congestion and facilitate smooth vehicular movement within the city, will be developed at a cost of Rs 380 crore. The Jagannath Ballav Pilgrim Centre will be set up with an investment of Rs 190 crore over 5.5 acres. It will have facilities like multi-level parking for 1,000 cars, tourist amenities, commercial space, meditation centre and multi-modal hub.

Naveen also laid foundation stone of renovation of municipal market complex into a modern market complex along Grand Road. As many as 550 vending outlets and parking space for 100 cars will be developed with an investment Rs 50 crore. A multi-level parking for 500 cars and 350 vending outlets will also come up at Jail Road at a cost of Rs 96 crore.

All these four projects are part of the Puri World Heritage Project that aims to transform Puri into a world-class heritage city. Construction for these projects would start very soon. All these Abadha projects are targeted to be completed by end of the 2022, said a senior works department official.

Projects outside Abadha include seafront vending zone with an investment of Rs 12 crore, redevelopment of Swargadwara at a cost of Rs 5 crore and centralised kitchen for midday meal and Aahar by spending Rs 10 crore. Naveen also reviewed the heritage corridor project around the temple and on the Grand Road where works secretary Krishan Kumar and 5T secretary VK Pandian briefed him about the status.

Koraput: The Koraput district police have started installing high resolution CCTV cameras in urban areas of the district as part of the measures to strengthen security and check crimes.

While police have installed at least 35 CCTV cameras in Kotpad, situated along Odisha-Chhattisgarh border on Thursday, work is on for installation of 92 CCTV cameras at Jeypore and 62 CCTV cameras at Semiliguda and Sunabeda.

“Kotpad being the border town of the district and coming under the corridor of ganja smugglers, CCTV cameras were first installed at the town on a priority basis and installation of CCTV cameras in other towns of the district is in full swing,” said SP (Koraput) Mukesh Kumar Bhamoo.

According to the SP, the cameras are installed at all important locations of the towns and the installation of cameras in all urban bodies of the district is expected to be completed by January 26.

“It will help arrest crime as the towns’ key areas will be under 24x7 surveillance,” the SP said.

While latest technology and high-resolution motorised zoom facility CCTV cameras have been put to use, a control room has been set up at the town police station concerned from where officials would monitor the areas under CCTV surveillance.

Selected officials can see the live footage of the CCTV cameras in their mobile phones, the SP said.

Police is hopeful that the CCTV cameras would bring down the crime graph, especially snatching, motorcycle theft, ganja smuggling and rash driving as the technology would cut response time.

Meanwhile, locals have hailed police for installing the CCTV cameras in the urban areas of the district.

“Presence of CCTV cameras across the towns will give a sense of security to residents even in the dead of the night. However, their proper maintenance is to be ensured,” said Sashi Bhusan Patnaik, adviser, Chamber of Commerce, Jeypore.

KOLKATA: The KMC plans to overhaul the century-old New Market , large parts of which have been showing signs of decay over the past few years, to give it a fresh lease of life.But before work starts, the civic authorities will conduct a detailed study of the Grade-I heritage market to ascertain the current condition of the structure. The civic body will float a tender to appoint an agency to carry out the survey. It was also weighing the option of roping in the best structural engineers to conduct the structural stability test of New Market before going in for “total restoration” of the structure, said senior KMC market department official.The KMC, however, has a challenge before they can start restoration: the illegal occupants of the market will have to be evicted. “Large portions of the ceiling of the market have been made vulnerable owing to the construction of make-shift structures on the terrace. We need to evict the occupants and raze the makeshift structures to make the building structurally safe,” said a KMC market department official, adding effective steps were being planned to remove the people from New Market’s roof, which they have turned into their homes.The frequent incidents of concrete chunks falling off the ceiling in different parts of the 145-year-old market over the past five years has apparently nudged the civic top brass to take the initiative to restore the crumbling structure from further decay. “New Market is an inseparable part of the city’s rich history,” said a KMC market department official. “Sadly, many parts of the building have developed major cracks. Concrete is falling off the ceiling at regular intervals. It’s time we conducted a detailed study of the structure and came up with a solution to save the historic market from collapsing.”A KMC buildings department official conceded that large parts of New Market were crying out for urgent repairs. Pointing out that the condition was especially poor in the flower range, meat range, fish range, vegetable range and Golghar , the official expressed apprehension that if a comprehensive repair work was not taken up soon, it might “cost them dear”. “Though we have taken up temporary repair work from time to time, we need to chalk out a comprehensive restoration policy for the heritage market to make it structurally safe. Any further delay in this direction will cost us dearly,” the KMC building department official said.

Puducherry: Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi said a one-member expert committee constituted by the council of ministers recommended the closure of Anglo-French Textiles (AFT) mill in view of mounting liabilities.

Bedi, in a statement, pointed out that the board of directors of the AFT mill also accepted the recommendation and resolved to close the mill. She said the council of ministers, however, decided to introduce voluntary retirement scheme instead of closing the mill. She was of the view that the decision of the board of directors to close the mill will be ‘appropriate’ considering its financial situation.

The lieutenant governor said she referred the issue to the Union government as there was a difference of opinion with the council of ministers in April 2019.

She told the Centre that the mill management had been asked to file a notice for closure as per the Industrial Dispute Act pending its final decision. “The final decision of the Union government in the matter of closure is expected shortly,” she said.

Meanwhile, the AFT managing director on Tuesday filed a notice seeking the government’s permission to close the mill under Section 25-O of the Industrial Disputes Act.

Now, the government represented by the labour department will hold a detailed inquiry eliciting the views of the management, workers and other stakeholders, including bankers, who provided loans to the mill.

Bedi said the labour department will study the reasons for closure keeping in mind the interest of the general public and other relevant factors and submit a report to the government.

She said she has approved the release of grant-in-aid to the mill to pay lay-off compensation to the workers on January 9.

Speaking to reporters on the tax cut decision, former transport minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar said he disputes the fact that the transport department had the approval of the finance department.

“Even if there was a cabinet approval, we will stand by our demand of an inquiry into the tax cut issue,” Dhavalikar said.

He questioned the rationale behind a cut in road tax when the automobile companies had come out with schemes to sell outdated models. “What was the reason for the state to reduce the tax and cause Rs 48 crore loss,” he questioned.

MUMBAI: Wading into the controversy Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut stoked with his comment that former PM Indira Gandhi had met gangster Karim Lala, another mafia don Haji Mastan’s adopted son Sundar Shekhar said on Thursday many Congress members like Murli Deora and Sushilkumar Shinde would meet his ‘baba’.

“Baba was a pucca Congressi. I remember senior Congress leaders like Vasantdada Patil , Murli Deora and Sushilkumar Shinde meeting him,” said Shekhar. He wondered why Raut had changed his statement on Thursday. “Small leaders would meet Haji Mastan at a hotel in central Mumbai while big leaders would meet at a five-star hotel in south Mumbai.” At times, he would go to Delhi too, he said.

Though Shekhar claimed Haji Mastan had raised him, Mastan’s family had earlier denied he was adopted by Mastan.

Shekhar added that till 1984, Haji Mastan or Mastan Mirza was in Congress. “But after Indira Gandhi’s death in October 1984, baba left Congress and along with Joginder Kaware founded Dalit Muslim Suraksha Mahasangh in 1985,” he said. “I remember Ramdas Athavale (RPI leader) would stand outside the room while baba and Kaware held meetings,” he recalled. “Both Muslims and Dalits ditched him and he changed his party’s name to Bharatiya Minorities Suraksha Mahasangh.”

Panaji: Elections to the North and South Goa zilla panchayats (ZP) will be held on March 15.

The polls, which will involve all 50 ZP constituencies — 25 each in North and South Goa — will be held on party lines. TOI was the first to report that the ZP elections would be held on party lines.

A detailed notification of the schedule for the election process will be issued in February, state election commissioner R K Srivastava told TOI. He also said the commission has begun preparing the electoral roll.

Political observers said the ZP polls will determine the strength of each political party. “It is akin to a mid-term poll to test the waters. The results will show who stands where,” a political observer said.

While BJP and Congress have already declared that they will contest the elections on party lines, GFP president Vijai Sardesai said GFP functionaries would meet by the end of the week to decide on whether to contest the ZP elections on party lines or to support independent candidates. GFP is represented by three MLAs.

MGP president Deepak Dhavalikar said the party has decided to contest the ZP polls independently. MGP has favoured elections on party lines in a bid to ascertain its political clout in the state.

In 2015, then chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar had decided to conduct ZP elections along party lines. The Goa Panchayat Raj Act was accordingly amended in March that year. The provision, however, was not extended to village panchayat elections.

Reresentative image

JAIPUR: To expand the facility of free coaching to the students of private colleges of the state, Rajasthan higher education department has issued directions to private colleges to run free coaching classes to help them prepare for competitive examinations.

Government colleges in the state are already running such coaching classes since last year for the students under the programme ‘Pratiyogita Dakshata’. The government now wants private colleges affiliated with it to run similar classes.

Commissioner of college education Pradeep Borad said that they are hopeful that students will be benefitted by this. “We want the participation of the private organisations in this programme as well. They have to start the classes from this session and there are colleges who have already begun the session. It will have an impact in the coming days as students won’t have to pay high fees to the private coaching classes,” said Borad.

There are many types of coaching classes going on and to decide which type of coaching will be provided to the students will depend on the majority. “Most of the students are interested in RAS and UPSC coaching but if the majority of the students are interested in Patwari or REET exam than that coaching will be given. Students will be given an option to choose the types of coaching they would want to choose” said Borad.

There are more than 400 private colleges in the state getting affiliation and NOC from the government which makes it mandatory for them to run such classes. The administrative control of private colleges is in the hands of the government.

BENGALURU: With Bengaluru being one of the four Indian cities included in the World Bank list for conducting a global ease-of-doing-business survey, the state government is on a mission to revamp Karnataka Udyog Mitra, its single-window clearance portal for project approvals.

“We want to streamline KUM and make it more integrated. Currently, it has only 10 departments. We have added 38 in the new portal and this number may go up in time,” said an official from the industries and commerce department. he revamped portal is likely to be launched by March.

The new portal is expected to speed up the process of getting clearances and approvals, especially no-objection certificates, which have been described by many as the biggest pain-point in starting a business here.

The new portal will be linked to DigiLocker app, through which an applicant will receive updates on the status of applications with each department, including notifications on scheduled inspections and visits. The portal will also be linked with the Karnataka Sakala Act website, which will send reports to the respective department’s commissioner if work is pending beyond the stipulated period.

“The line department’s responses and further requirements will be sent to the applicant through DigiLocker app. If line departments need additional documents, they can source them from the app. These features will be implemented under phase 1 of the revamp project,” an official said.

Over the past two weeks, coordination meetings have been held with over 10 departments including BBMP, BWSSB, KSPCB, fire and emergency services, Bescom, factories, boilers and industrial safety department and health department.

Karnataka’s score in the statewise ease-of-doing-business report, released by the department of industrial policy and promotion, has risen from 48.5 in 2015 to 88.4 in 2017 and 96.4 in 2017 and 98.6 in 2018.

KOLKATA: A 19-year-old youth on Thursday donated a portion of his liver to save the life of his father. Ranjit Kundu (44), who runs a hardware shop in Basirhat, has been suffering from a serious liver disease for more than three years.

Ranjit was taken to different cities, including Delhi and Bangalore, for treatment. Everywhere, he was told that a liver transplant was the only way he could be saved. But in the absence of any donor, Ranjit’s condition kept deteriorating. “Abhjit Chowdhury, a doctor at SSKM Hospital , said liver transplant was the only option to save his life,” said the patient’s younger brother, Jayanta.

Given the situation, Ranjit’s son, Pratim, a first-year undergraduate student, started reading up on the internet about liver transplant and came to know about organ donation .

As a donor could not be found in spite of their best efforts, Pratim decided to donate a part of his liver. Doctors were told about it and the surgery was carried out at SSKM Hospital’s School of Digestive and Liver Diseases (SDLD). Doctors at SDLD said the surgery was successful and both the recipient and the donor would remain in the post-operative intensive care unit.

Jayanta added, “My nephew had been very concerned about his father’s health. He said he would donate a part of his liver to save his father as we did not come by any donor.” Pratim’s family initially tried to deter him because of his young age, but he told them that his life would be meaningless if he could not save his father.

“Considering the donor’s age, the recipient has got a good quality liver. So, we expect a good outcome. This was our first liver transplant for 2020,” said SDLD head, GK Dhali.

BENGALURU: A private helicopter emergency medical services firm on Thursday said it has offered to run air ambulance services in Karnataka and sought the state government’s partnership.

The firm, International Critical-Care Air Transfer Team, conducted a mock drill which saw dummy accident victims being transported from Mandya to Jakkur aerodrome. Co-founder Shalini Nilshad said: “We are thinking of making it a free service by tying up with the Karnataka government . Air ambulance teams attending to accident victims are often seen in the US, UK and other European countries.”

While she did not elaborate on how the company plans to fund the project, Shalini, however, said designated landing strips will be identified and created along highways in Karnataka, which could be used for choppers to land in case of accidents.

Deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan, who was present at Jakkur where the helicopter from Mandya landed, did not comment on ICATT’s proposal . Financial viability and sustainability have been the pain points of such projects in the past.

“Over the years, several air ambulance providers have shut shop. This business will be successful only when people can afford it. In other countries, these services are covered under insurance,” said Sanjay Mishra, MD of Air Rescuers Worldwide.

The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its judgment in a plea by a mining company seeking the court’s nod to commercially use and transport iron ore that was extracted prior to March 15, 2018 and lies unused in its mines in Goa.

Mining in the state came to a halt on March 15, 2018, after the apex court quashed the second renewal of the mining leases of 88 companies.

“The Supreme Court has reserved its judgment on transportation of ore that was extracted prior to the mining ban and is lying inside and outside leased areas. Arguments concluded on Thursday. If permitted by the Supreme Court, it will provide temporary relief to mining affected areas. The judgment is likely to be passed soon,” the chief minister’s office announced.

A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant reserved its order after hearing arguments from senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Chowgule and Company Pvt Ltd, and lawyer Prashant Bhushan who has been representing the NGO, Goa Foundation .

The mining company is aggrieved by an order of the high court and has been seeking a nod from the apex court to permit it to commercially use and transport mined iron ore. The plea has been vehemently opposed by Goa Foundation, which alleged that the apex court in 2014 had held that the mining leases of various companies were illegal after 2007.

“The mined iron ore is illegal and is state property which needed to be confiscated,” Bhushan argued, adding that later in 2018, a bench headed by Justice Madan B Lokur also quashed the renewal of mining leases of over 80 companies.

Rohatgi said the company was empowered to conduct its mining business for six months after the closure of mining at the direction of the apex court. He asked that the mining firm be allowed to commercially use iron ore that had already been mined.

JAIPUR: The commissioner of metro rail safety is likely to conduct safety inspection of Jaipur Metro , Phase IB corridor in March .

As finishing work of the underground corridor is expected to be completed next month, the Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) is planning to invite CMRS in February.

A senior JMRC official said, “We are already conducting internal trials. We will invite the CMRS by the end of February. During the inspection, the commissioner will check track parameters, tunnels and the stations, calibration of the trains and firefighting system among others,” he said.

Official said, the JMRC started internal trial run in November last year on Phase IB corridor which has underground length of 2.4km from Chandpole to Badi Chaupar in the Walled City. The underground corridor, which is expansion of Phase-I (Mansarovar to Chandpole) is expected to be operational by March 2020, as per the plan.

In September 2018, the internal trials were initiated to enable former chief minister Vasundhara Raje to flag off the project like her successor Ashok Gehlot did it in 2013. However, the plan failed as project was not completed, official sources said.

The length of entire Metro corridor Phase 1A and 1B is 12.07km. After BJP came to power, Raje inaugurated Jaipur Metro Rail Project (Phase 1A) in June 2015. This corridor was made operational in 2015 after spending Rs 2,023 crore. An official said, “The project cost of underground Phase-IB project is Rs 1,126 crore. Out of which, Rs 969 crore has been provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).”

Sources at JMRC said, the Metro Phase 1B missed its June 2018 deadline due to various reasons including Supreme Court ban on sand mining, shifting of seven temples and design change of two underground stations. The JMRC officials believe there will be increase in ridership after the Phase 1B) is operational. In absence of Phase 1B, the performance of Phase-IA of Jaipur Metro was ‘poor’ as the average ridership dipped.

“At present, average 20,000 passengers commute through Metro daily, as against the projected figure of one lakh. But Phase-II is expected to boost the numbers,” said a senior official.

JAIPUR: Urban Development and Housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal has accused the previous BJP government of carrying out several works under the Dravyavati river project without issuing tenders.

“Both the projects, Dravyavati river and Ring Road are delayed due to BJP’s lack of planning. The ring road cannot be made operational as railway permission is pending,” said Dhariwal

The minister attacked the previous government while inaugurating a multi-level parking at C-Scheme locality on Thursday. After change of regime in December 2018, the multi-crore project was moving at a snail's pace as contractor was demanding the due amount. The minister, however, said that the firm carried out work, which was not mentioned in the tender agreement.

The project, which will accommodate 400 cars. The parking is expected to provide relief to number of office-goers as there is no space in the area.

An official source at the JMC said, construction of the multi-level parking project started about nine years ago on public private and partnership mode. The contractor was given rights to construct a commercial space on government land in exchange.

“The project was embroiled in controversy after the contractor moved an application to raise the height of building (commercial space) from 15 metre to 22 metre. However, objections were raised by the department for the same. The project was delayed for this reason,” sources said.

Parking has been a major issue in the fast-growing Jaipur as the number of registered vehicles increases by 12% annually. “Vehicles parked on roads not only obstruct traffic, lack of parking space also creates a difficulty for the visitors at the major markets. The parking will resolve the problem in the area,” sources said.

JAIPUR: Sawai Man Singh Hospital scripted a major success in performing its first heart transplant on the intervening night of Wednesday-Thursday. The cardiac surgeons retrieved the heart of a 25-year-old man and transplanted it into a 15-year-old boy, suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy.

The recipient had an enlarged heart due to the disease and it was functioning at less than 15% of its capacity. The recipient had complained of decreasing urine output, breathlessness and also he had edema over his body, which made him almost bed-ridden. He was in touch with the SMS Hospital doctors as he was undergoing treatment at the hospital. He belongs to Sawai Madhopur.

When the doctors called him over the phone about a donor whose relatives had given consent to donate his organs — heart, liver and two kidneys, the boy’s family rushed to the hospital for the transplant, which started at around 4am and it was completed at around 8am. The doctors took four hours to complete the transplant.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted, “Happy to know that first ever heart transplant has been performed in SMS government hospital, #Jaipur today. I pray to God for it to be successful and may the patient regain health soon. #Rajasthan.”

Health minister Raghu Sharma congratulated SMS Hospital's team for performing the heart transplant in a government hospital. Dr D S Meena, medical superintendent, SMS Hospital said, “The donor belonged to Bheem of Rajsamand district, who was brought to the hospital as he had suffered severe head injury on January 10 in a road accident.”

He said that the youth was unconscious and despite the doctors providing him treatment, he did not regain consciousness. A committee, which declares patient brain-dead and certify it by conducting certain tests, declared the 25-year-old brain dead on Wednesday afternoon. Following that, a team of counsellors of the hospital encouraged the relatives of the patient to donate the organs. The family gave its consent and at around midnight, the doctors started procedure of retrieving his organs. The patient was undergoing treatment at SMS Hospital's Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics (ITO), he was shifted to main SMS Hospital's building, Dhanwantri building’s second floor.

There, the doctors started retrieving his organs. His liver was transported to a private hospital in Jaipur for transplanting it into a liver-failure patient. “The two kidneys harvested from the donor were transplanted into a 35-year-old male and 37-year-old female, who were undergoing dialysis for past few months. Both kidneys were transplanted into patients at SMS Hospital,” said Dr SS Yadav, senior professor and head of the department (urology), SMS Hospital.

At one point of time, the vital parameters of the donor became unsuitable for organ donation as his blood pressure and pulse rate had also gone down but later his parameters improved, which made the transplant possible.

PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Thursday that the Supreme Court’s decision paving way for the construction of the greenfield international airport at Mopa was “a great relief” for the state and it would become operational in January 2022.

As per the earlier schedule, the first phase of the Mopa airport was supposed to be completed by September 30, 2020.

Sawant said the government was keen to fast-track the project and appealed to people “not to crate obstructions for small reasons”. He also urged the people of Goa not to block the development of the greenfield project in the larger interests of the state, and its tourism industry.

In an obvious message towards activists and environmentalists, Sawant called on Goans to co-operate with the state government. “We don’t want to damage the environment. We will take care of the environment while ushering in development,” he said.

The chief minister also said some people, in the name of the environment, try to stop or block the development of the state. “This should not happen,” he said.

“The Mopa airport will open up new avenues for Goa, and propel the state’s economic growth,” Sawant said.

“Our government is committed towards sustainable development that priortises its people and environment,” he said.

Margao: Director of urban development Tariq Thomas in his order passed on an appeal against the “part occupancy” certificate issued by Margao Municipal Council (MMC) for a commercial project at Aquem, Margao, in November 2019 has been kept it in abeyance until the next date of hearing.

The appeal has been filed by Margao resident Shirish Kamat pointing out that the project stands on a wetland which is in an open space and that all approvals by various authorities have been obtained “illegally”.

Kamat in his complaint pointed out that there is no such provision in the law to issue any such thing called ‘part occupancy ’ and that the certificate issued by MMC wasn’t as per the format specified in the Goa Land and Development Building Construction Regulation 2010.

The complaint had stated that on the strength of the part occupancy certificate, the developer will induct third parties in the building, thereby creating third party rights, complicating matters further.

He further pointed out that the MMC chief officer couldn’t issue any occupancy, let alone part occupancy, in any manner until he decides on the “serious illegalities” raised before him.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan high court directed the panchayati raj department to find out the number of posts remaining unfilled out of the 41,000 posts of third grade teachers announced in 2012, and fill the vacancies with the petitioners.

The division bench of Justice Sabina and NS Dhaddha gave the order on a petition by Namonarayan Sharma and about 80 others. The petitioners claimed that the candidates who had scored less marks than the appellants were selected.

During the pendency of the writ petition, the results were revised because of revision of answer key, the candidates who had scored lower in merit than the appellants also made it in to the selection process. But such candidate was retained in service on the directions of a single bench order which was upheld later by a division bench.

So, the court directed that the petitioners be accommodated in the vacancies existing out of the 41,000 posts announced.

357,['17/01/2020'],SC clears construction of Mopa international airport under NEERI watch,"This story is from January 17, 2020

NEW DELHI / PANAJI: In a major relief to the state government, the Supreme Court on Thursday lifted the suspension on construction of greenfield Mopa international airport , being developed by GMR , after a year and asked the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute ( NEERI ) to oversee the project to ensure that there is no environmental damage or danger to flora and fauna of the area.

A bench of justices D Y Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta also directed the concessionaire of the project to adopt a zero-carbon programme in construction and operational phases of the airport.

The Supreme Court last year found fault in the environment clearance given to the project before staying construction and directed the expert appraisal committee (EAC) to re-examine it.

The court said conditions imposed by the EAC and National Green Tribunal (NGT) are sufficient to protect environment.

Over 54,000 trees were felled on the project site and the developer has been directed to plant 5.5 lakh trees.

The Supreme Court also said that the project proponent would bear the expenses and fees of NEERI.

As per the earlier schedule, the first phase of Mopa airport was supposed to be complete by September 30, 2020.

After examining all aspects of the project as directed by the apex court, the EAC cleared it but imposed additional conditions to protect environment. The concessionaire has now been subjected to over 100 mitigatory conditions, which include 16 at the behest of NGT and 40 imposed by EAC in the second round of clearance.

Expressing satisfaction on the conditions imposed, the bench said, “the EAC has adequately addressed these concerns and laid down additional conditions to ensure adequate protection of the environment”.

It refused to accept a plea that EAC failed to analyse the impact of the project comprehensively and said, “it cannot be said that the EAC has, in its appraisal process, ignored the concerns”.

In its earlier judgment, the Supreme Court had highlighted numerous deficiencies by the project proponent leading to the grant of EC. The court had also noted the abject failure of the project proponent to provide complete information on the existence of reserved forests.

Approving the decision of EAC, the bench said, “The evaluation of merits is a matter which primarily rests with an expert authority. The court can certainly supervise procedural compliance and ensure that all necessary inputs which are required to be factored into the decision-making process have been duly borne in mind. Once this has been done, the court must be circumspect in micro-managing the decision-making process by EAC by substituting its own opinion for that of EAC. Undoubtedly, no process can be perfect or free from studied criticism.”

Rajasthan transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas

JAIPUR: State transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said that the Central Motor Vehicles Act is totally anti-people and asked the Union surface transport minister Nitin Gadkari to rethink the new Act.

He was speaking at the road safety council meeting held in New Delhi on Thursday. He said the penalty in the new Act is so high that about 80% of the people could not afford it and drive in fear as they do not have that much money in their pockets to pay penalty. He pointed out that only eight states have implemented the new Motor Vehicles Act and the Central government should listen to the people where they were not able to pay such a hefty penalty.

He said there are chances of more accidents if drivers in their effort to evade penalty, resort to rash driving. He said under Section 200 of the Act which comes under the purview of the state government, Rajasthan has decided to reduce compoundable penalty. But he said non-compoundable penalty is very high and could not be reduced by the states. So, he said the Motor Vehicles Act requires revision.

Cops investigate the case at the mall where the youth committed suicide

JAIPUR: Police have identified the youth who, in a suspected case of suicide, jumped from a mall near Bais Godam in the city on Wednesday. His family has been informed, though it is still uncertain if he fell accidentally or jumped on his own.

The deceased has been identified as 27-year-old Keval Sharma and his body was handed over to the family after post-mortem on Thursday.

Shreemohan Meena, SHO, Ashok Nagar police station said, “Although the deceased has been identified and it is almost certain that it is a case of suicide, the reason for it remains unclear. No suicide note was found on his body. The staff heard something hit the ground and when they rushed out, they saw Keval lying there in a pool of blood.”

The CCTV camera footage showed Keval taking the elevator up and police are looking further to check the floor which he jumped from. “Till now, the footage shows Keval taking the lift but we are trying to confirm the floor from which he jumped, though it appears that it is likely to be from the highest point of the mall,” added the SHO.

Keval was unmarried and cops are questioning the family as well to ascertain the reason behind the suspected suicide. The official said, “We will question the family as well to see if they had any idea as to why Keval took the extreme step. Probably, he was under some kind of stress but that remains to be found yet.”

Last year in November, 26-year-old Rohit Sharma jumped from a mall in the city just a day after getting married. Sharma had gone to the mall to buy a gift for his wife but instead jumped to his death. During investigation, police had found that initially Sharma had planned on consuming phenyl but for unknown reasons, chose to jump from the fifth floor of the mall.

360,['17/01/2020'],Michael Lobo for law to curb non-Goans from buying farm land in Goa,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Michael Lobo

CALANGUTE: Stating that Goan identity was in danger of being wiped out because of the huge influx of non-Goans who have settled in the tiny coastal state, ports minister Michael Lobo said the only way to save it was to bring in a legislation to stop them from buying orchard and agricultural land in the state.

“Outsiders come and buy orchard and agricultural land, build houses and settle down in Goa because this land is cheap. They should only be allowed to purchase flats as they are more expensive, and fewer people can buy them,” he said. The number of non-Goans would be restricted if this is imposed, the ports minister said at the Opinion Poll Day celebrations organised by the Calangute panchayat on Thursday.

Lobo said he was contemplating tabling a bill in the state assembly, which would enable only those with 25-year domicile to buy land in the state.

The minister said he would lobby with chief minister Pramod Sawant and state BJP chief Sadanand Shet Tanavade to pass a law in the state assembly, allowing non-Goans to only purchase flats and land tracts which are already converted into settlement zones.

He said the original figure of Goans has not increased, and expressed fears that the indigenous population could soon reduce to a minority.

Stating that it is not possible to debar people from other parts of the country from buying land in Goa, Lobo who represents Calangute constituency, the hotspot of tourism in the state, said a legislation could help curb the trend.

Describing the 1967 Goa Opinion Poll as historic, the minister said it was only because of it that the state has retained its distinct identity.

“Unfortunately, the state government has still not given it the importance it deserves. Opinion Poll Day should be a state function. When Manohar Parrikar became chief minister in 2017, I had discussed the matter with him and he had said he would form a committee to take the proposal forward, but unfortunately he died soon after,” Lobo said. “I will work on this. There should be a resolution in the assembly that Goa should only be for Goans,” he said.

The family of Jack Sequeira complimented the Calangute panchayat for taking the initiative to install a statue of the father of the Opinion Poll in Calangute. “I have been coming here for the last 18 years on this day because Calangute first started celebrating this occasion, thanks to Joseph Sequeira,” Lily Sequeira, the daughter of Jack Sequeira said.

Jack Sequeira Jr, the grandson of the late leader, said if Goa had merged with Maharashtra, “today we would have been a backyard of Maharashtra”. “The Opinion Poll gave us an opportunity to grow and develop our own identity. Hopefully, one day the state government will take cognisance of this and give it due recognition,” he said.

JAIPUR: With Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor ( DMIC ) work in the state falling far behind the schedule, the government is weighing options to bring the department under Bhiwadi Industrial Development Authority ( BIDA ) or RIICO for fast tracking trunk infrastructure development.Lack of funds for buying land and the non-availability of adequate officials on the ground have been major roadblocks for implementation of the project.On Wednesday industries minister Prasadi Lal Meena even admitted that the other five states sharing the route of the corridor have made significant progress, while Rajasthan is yet to make a beginning.Meena said that the government has identified 532 hectare land in five villages for which compensation worth Rs 128 crore will be given by March this year. The government has already paid Rs 20 crore last year as compensation for land last year.But earlier estimates suggests that the government needs Rs 3,000 crore to pay for 1,425 hectare for Khuskhera-Bhiwadi-Neemrana (KBN) Industrial Smart City. Even though the process for land acquisition started in 2012, no significant progress has been made so far.Additional chief secretary, industries, Subodh Agarwal, who had recently visited Dholera in Gujarat and has been following up other states to understand the DMIC work being implemented there, said, “We are thinking of dissolving the DMIC department and transfering the posts to BIDA or RIICO so that work can be fast-tracked. In fact, there is no separate department for DMIC in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana or Madhya Pradesh that share the corridor. The work in those states are carried out by existing corporations or authorities of the respective governments. In fact, this is one of the reasons why the project in the state has not progressed at the desired pace.”Agarwal said under BIDA or RIICO, the advantages will be manifold in terms of ease of doing business, work culture and retention of officers or employees and they will add impetus to the complex process of implementation that the project requires.“We need dedicated people on the ground to understand and address local issues for hassle-free implementation, while the broader policy and strategic decisions can be taken care by the Industries department. The project has already suffered a prolonged delay and we cannot afford to lose any more time,” added AgarwalThe $100-billion dollar project is being built along the high-speed Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) that would reduce the time for goods movement between Dadri near Delhi to Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai from current 14 days to about 14 hours.

KOLKATA: ‘Apolitical’ tents were being put up at Park Circus on Thursday evening for the protesters who are agitating against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens for the last nine days. Provisions for bio-toilets and running water will also be made.Asmat Jamil, who is leading the protest, met chief minister Mamata Banerjee at her residence on Wednesday and requested her to grant permission to put up a shed as it was becoming difficult for the women and the kids to stay in the open at night. She also spoke about the lack of basic amenities — like running water, washroom and light — at the venue.“Within 24 hours, I got a call from chief minister’s office. We will arrange for all the basic amenities with the government’s permission. I am thankful to Didi for understanding our problems and keeping her words,” said Jamil, adding that a request had been made for a white tent as it is a protest without a political banner. During the meeting, Jamil also invited Mamata Banerjee to visit the sit-in at Park Circus.Echoing Jamil, Uzma Alam, another protester, said she was thankful to the chief minister for supporting their cause. “Being a woman herself, the chief minister understood our problems. Everyone who is supporting our cause is welcome to join us but we request everyone to come as a citizen of the country, leaving behind their political affiliation,” said Alam.Local councillor Sana Ahmed said: “I met the protesters at Park Circus on Thursday and listened to their problems.”According to Rafiqua Hayat, a graduate, who has been staying in the open and chanting slogans all night to keep the morale of the protesters high, it’s a small victory that they have achieved.“This will encourage and motivate us to fight the long battle against NRC, NPR and CAA,” she said.Eighty-year-old Nurjahan Shakil comes to Park Circus every day to show solidarity with the movement against CAA. “Most of the young women have infants, who they bring to the protest venue with them because there is nobody at home to take care of them. “They are fighting to defend the Constitution and I am happy that their sacrifice has been recognized and basic amenities are being provided,” said Shakil.APDR’s Altaf Ahmed believes the continuous movement of common people, especially these women, who fought all odds for nine days and stayed in the open to protest against the act, deserves basic facilities. APDR submitted a deputation to the mayor-in-council on Wednesday, requesting the administration to grant permission for tent and bio-toilets.The sit-in, which started last Tuesday with a group of women and students from different campuses, has seen steady rise in the number of participants, with more and more people joining in every day. Hundreds of women are protesting at Park Circus Maidan, which is being identified as Kolkata’s Shaheen Bagh without any basic amenities like running water, washroom and shelter.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73314900,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-603392,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/park-circus-protesters-get-a-tent-after-braving-cold-for-nine-days/articleshow/73309704.cms
368,['17/01/2020'],Officer’s response to stray dog complaint on Rajasthan portal goes viral,"This story is from January 17, 2020

UDAIPUR: When Prahlad Keer of Udaipur turned to the Rajasthan Sampark portal to lodge his grievance about the menace caused by a stray dog in the village, the response posted by the village development officer disposing the case, took a comical twist, which is now going viral on social media.

Keer, a resident of Dhava gram panchayat in Vallabhnagar panchayat samiti, had on November 2019, lodged a complaint on the sampark portal, wherein he wrote that a female dog bit everyone in the locality. The village development officer, who made an enquiry about the complaint, uploaded the response on the portal on January 15. The officer Malkesh Meena replied, “After speaking to the locals, it has been found that the bitch did not bite anybody. Many children and people pass through the street and she harms no one. Since the complainant had hit the animal, she barked at him but didn’t bite him. Hence, the complaint is fit to be disposed of.” People are finding the nature of the complaint weird and the authority’s response in disposal even funnier. Some even expressed their reservations over the language used by the officer.

“The complainant was a common man so its understandable that he used unparliamentary words for the animal, but the officer should have been more careful. These people cannot be respectable to poor animals, leave alone fellow peeps who they hold in scant respect anyway. However, the letter, its content and the seriousness of the disposal is truly funny,” said a senior police officer wishing anonymity. Upendra Kumar Sharma, BDO, Bhinder said the letter is not a complete one.

KOLKATA: Die-hard fans of Mohun Bagan had a tough digesting the news of the merger of India’s oldest surviving top-tier football club with two-time ISL champion ATK, with some of them lashing out their angst and perplexity on social media. But in the end, the reaction from most fans was obvious — acceptance with a heavy heart.“Logically thinking, the arrangement serves both the clubs. While ATK has the financial stability, Mohun Bagan comes with 131 years of heritage and legacy that no other football club in India can boast of. The merger can turn the club into a formidable force. But being an emotional fan, it is hard to see a club my entire family has been rooting for years suddenly becoming a different entity. I am certain, the passion will be missing,” said Saikat Banerjee, a techie and an ardent Mohun Bagan fan from Behala.For more than a year, fans were aware of the speculation about ATK joining hands with Mohun Bagan. Even then, when the announcement was finally made on Thursday, it was a difficult pill for fans to digest.“RPSG group is the best investor Mohun Bagan can ever have but if the new arrangement results in tampering of the jersey colour, flag or the logo, fans like me will not take it lightly. If the new club has to lure the Mohun Bagan fanbase, they will have to keep some of these aspects intact,” said Sumanta Chakraborty, a banker. Some ATK fans, too, were livid over the fact that they would have to share the stands with Mohun Bagan supporters.Social media was abuzz with sane voices as well. “Being a Mohun Bagan fan, it’s hard to believe that Mohun Bagan isn’t an autonomous body anymore. But somehow, we should be happy that Bangalir football will get more exposure and Indian players will get world-class facilities to develop their skills. If you say about our heritage, where has it gone in last few years? A Bengal derby used have a maximum of two to three Bengali players,” wrote Samrat Banerjee on Facebook.There were also some who raised more pertinent questions like the future arrangements of the players. “Forget about fans and their emotions, what about the players.. currently there are 40 or 50 players playing in these two teams and do not forget ATK has its reserve squad too. What about these players’ future?” asked Arijit Denre, a fan from Howrah.But in the end, most fans said they would have to accept that it was necessary for the legendary club to do away with archaic ways of administration and embrace a professional structure but passionate fans still added that all they want are the name, jersey colour and logo of the century-old club to remain intact.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73315376,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-795317,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/atk-mohun-bagan-merger-news-sinks-in-slowly/articleshow/73309714.cms
370,['17/01/2020'],ATK-Mohun Bagan deal: Acceptance at 130-year-old club’s birthplace,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Mitra Bari, from where Mohun Bagan club was formed 130 years ago

KOLKATA: Gouri Bhaduri, the wife of legendary Mohun Bagan player Shibdas Bhaduri’s great grandson, was hesitant about the ATK-Mohun Bagan deal. For someone who has Mohun Bagan in her blood, the name of ATK is alien. “It would be better if they retain the name of Mohun Bagan. I do not know ATK,” she said.

Though Gouri Bhaduri has never heard of ATK, her son-in-law Paritosh Ranjan Roy has fair knowledge about ISL and ATK. On Thursday, Roy was a bit pragmatic. From his heart he wants Mohun Bagan’s name to stay but he can understand the compulsion. “If it is needed for the existence of the club then I have no problem with the new set-up,” he said.

Another Mohun Bagan supporter Dhruba Ghosal, who is watching his favourite team play for over 50 years, however, was yet to make up his mind. “Perhaps, it was needed but considering the heritage of our club, Mohun Bagan’s name should come before ATK. It should be Mohun Bagan ATK and not the other way around,” he said.

Hirak Kumar Mitra, a descendant of Mitra family, in whose home ground Bagan started its journey 130 years back, was more vocal in support of the merger. Mitra has seen the likes of Sailen Manna and Chuni Goswami playing in Mohun Bagan colours. His grand-father Jatindranath Mitra had watched the historic IFA Shield Final in 1911. “We have not renewed the membership of Mohun Bagan for long. Actually, the old members were not very happy with the affairs of the club. It would be better if ATK can bring in professionalism here. No other clubs in India can match the kind of brand Mohun Bagan has,” he said.

Mitra believes Sanjiv Goenka has some vision of the club. “We all know ISL will be the best league in the country. So there was hardly any other option to be in ISL,” he argued. Utpal Bag, a veteran Mohun Bagan supporter, welcomed the move as well. He has been watching Bagan play since 1976 and became a club member in 1982. “This was needed, otherwise how will the club run? How long an individual will finance the club? If you do not have big sponsor, you stand no chance in ISL and I-League is soon becoming a second division tornament,” he justified. Die-hard Mohun Bagan fan Souvvik Ghosh echoed: “It is a step in the right direction.”

Nashik: Congress and Shiv Sena have decided to stitch a post-poll alliance to take control of the Nandurbar zilla parishad for the next five years.

The state leadership of both these parties have directed the local units to join hands in the ZP.

“Since both the parties are coalition partners in the Maha Aghadi Vikas (MVA) government in the state, we have decided to join hands for the Nandubar ZP. It would help the local body get all necessary support from the state government, including funds for carrying out development projects in the tribal-dominated district,” said state tribal welfare minister and local Congress MLA K C Padvi.

The state Congress has appointed Padvi to hold parleys with the Sena camp and work out the modalities of the ZP-level alliance.

Senior Sena functionary from Nandubar and former MLC Chandrakant Raghuvanshi said the state party leadership has directed the local unit to tie up with Congress.

The elections for the posts of ZP president and vice-president are slated to take place on Friday. The Nandubar voters had given a hung verdict in the recently concluded ZP polls with Congress and BJP winning 23 seats each. Both parties are short by six members to cross the magic mark of 29. The support of Sena, which won seven seats, is crucial for Congress. There was no pre-poll alliance between any of the parties in the ZP polls in Nandurbar.

According to the understanding, while the post of ZP president will go to Congress, the new ZP vice-president would be from Sena. “Sena has also demanded the post of the chairmen for two committees, which Congress is unwilling to give, since the number of seats that party has won is far less than what our party has won. We are holding talks with our Sena counterparts to convince them to settle for chairman of one committee,” Congress sources said.

NAGPUR: Come Sunday and city-based Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology ( VNIT ) would don a new look, thanks to its alumni association. The premier institution will celebrate its diamond jubilee by unveiling a 10-feet-high bronze statue of Sir M Visvesvaraya, after whom the institute is named.

A new-look entrance, with new fountains, street lights and a LED light show, would also be inaugurated on the day by Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari in the presence of VNIT’s Board of Governors (BOG) chairman Vishram Jamdar, director Pramod Padole, alumni association chairman Shashikant Chaudhary and others. Three more projects funded by the alumni would also be inaugurated by the dignitaries. They include a football ground, two lawn tennis courts, and a modern night tea kiosk for students called ‘Chandrama’.

Interestingly, all projects were entirely conceptualized, funded and implemented by various batches of VNIT.

“Our alumni association has collected Rs5 crore, which would be utilized not only for infrastructural projects, but also for various academic activities. We’ve so far finalized 11 projects to be funded by them. We’ve also entered into a pact with Union Transport Ministry for conducting classes on road safety and audit for government officials, including those from PWD and CPWD,” Padole told the media.

He added that the statue was made by Ram Sutaria, who was part of the team that built the world’s highest ‘Statue of Unity’ in Gujarat. “Fourteen of my PhD students have also contributed to the statue,” he said.

Explaining the other projects, Chaudhary said their association had been working since 2012 and so far has 1,600 life members. “The 1984 batch has taken up the task to gift the bronze statue, while 1985 batch has set up Chandrama. The 1986 batch has helped construct the tennis courts and 1992 batch has sponsored the football stadium. More alumni are coming forward to help their alma mater in the diamond jubilee year. Out of over 22,000 students who have graduated from this prestigious institution, we’ve got details of 20,000, although partially,” he said, adding that it felt nice to give back to your alma mater.

Jamdar informed that VNIT would be setting up a ‘Centre for Excellence in Innovation’ in collaboration with the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) division of the Government of India. “We will be hosting a meeting of directors of various NITs, and 16 of them have already agreed to attend, under this initiative. Vikram Kirloskar from Kirloskar Group has consented to deliver a lecture on carbon policy rating and accreditation on February 8 in our college,” he said.

Padole added that grand nephew of Visvesvaraya — Satish Mokshagundam and his wife Laxmi Satish — would be attending the function on Sunday. “Our alumni chapters are also working in Dubai and the USA apart from all metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore,” he said.

VALPOI: Mohammad Sauad Alam, 19, a native of Bihar , was arrested by the Valpoi police on Thursday after he tampered with the gold bangles of a woman in Keri on the pretext of polishing them.

Police said Alam visited the house of Devki Gawas in Ghoteli, Keri, and convinced her that he would bring back the original lustre of her gold ornaments. He then applied a powder on two of her gold bangles and dipped them into a liquid. In a few minutes, Gawas noticed that her bangles began turning black and their gold sheen had disappeared.

Her shouts for help were heard by several other villagers, who gathered at the spot and caught the accused. He, however, managed to escape. The villagers then alerted the police and began searching the entire village for him. He was found in the neighbouring village of Shiroli and was handed to the police. A case has been registered under provisions of the IPC.

KOLKATA: As the clock strikes noon, this small empty courtyard in Entally fills up with eager eyes and empty tummies. The promise of food has been bringing the hungry mouths from the neighbouring slums to this courtyard every afternoon since the beginning of the new year. It’s a strange mix here — Christian nuns feed Hindus and Muslims of all ages from the neighbouring slums. They eat and share out of each other’s plates and create a picture of complete harmony that could be a testament to vouch for in these troubled times.We are talking about the food ATM installed by the nuns of the Kolkata Mary Ward Social Centre at Loreto Convent Entally. The initiative was undertaken to feed slum dwellers of the neighbouring Tangra, Motijheel, Dhapa and Palmer Bazar areas. A little under 200 people, mostly kids, are fed lunch now. But the volunteers are hopeful that with more help coming in, they will be able to feed more people soon.For the moment, Loreto schools on Elliot Road and at Entally and Bowbazar are collecting, pooling and ferrying food to the food ATM. Loreto School Dharamtala has also pledged to contribute to the initiative. Students of these schools have been divided into batches. Under the supervision of teacher coordinators, they bring fresh, clean, home-cooked food, packed in containers ready to be distributed to the slum dwellers as they walk in. Every name is recorded in the register maintained at the ATM.“They sit around the courtyard to eat. We provide fresh drinking water, an egg and a banana each, along with the home-cooked food and do not allow them to carry it away. We make them sit there and eat everything because we know that carrying back the food can lead to wastage,” said director of the centre Monica Suchiang, who designed the programme.There’s quite a variety on the menu and no two plates are similar. If Salma Khatoun got a plate of biryani, Baby Singh may have got khichdi and subzi. No one is so selfish that s/he won’t share. In fact, they are happy sharing. On Thursday afternoon, 15-year-old ragpicker Zuber shared his fried rice and chilli chicken with friend and fellow ragpicker Raju who had got puri sabzi along with the egg and banana. “Hum log sab mil baant kar khate hain yahan. Memsaab log ek time ka pet bhar ke khana dete hain. (We eat together and happily share our food. Madams here fill our bellies once a day),” Zuber said.Schoolchildren who donate the food, bring in whatever is cooked at home. This is why no two children’s food pack are the same. Hence, the variety in the meals served. “We are happy that every child is eager to help. Each week, one class has to bring in food just once. Every child brings enough to feed one hungry mouth,” explained Nandini Bhattacharya, a teacher at Loreto Elliot Road, who is coordinating for her school. The centre’s cafeteria also cooks and serves thalis of rice, daal and subzi for the food ATM.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73315026,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-340599,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hindus-muslims-eat-at-food-atm-run-by-nuns/articleshow/73309730.cms

Nashik: Nashik police on Thursday claimed to have solved a city mobile shop burglary case by arresting one of the members of a seven-member gang from Bihar and recovering four iPhones worth Rs 1.20 lakh from him.

The crime branch I, who picked up the suspect from Ghorsahan village of Motihari district, discovered that the remaining six members of the gang are in Nepal and Bangladesh to dispose of the stolen mobile phones.

“The arrested suspect revealed under interrogation that his accomplices have gone to the neighbouring countries to sell the phones and also the modus operandi they adopted,” said they police.

Police said the same gang had targeted a showroom on the Gangapur road and stolen 82 iPhones on December 10 last year, following which an investigation had been launched.

The gang is engaged in stealing only select high-end mobile phones from various parts of the country and disposing them of in Nepal and Bangladesh because it is difficult to track the phones outside India, said police.

The CCTV footage showed that the security personnel posted at a jewellery shop near the mobile phone showroom on Gangapur road here left for home at 5am on December 10. The thieves approached the shop 20 minutes later and broke open the shutter after covering it with a bedsheet. The arrested suspect, along with the other gang members, stole the iPhones.

During the investigation, Gangapur police sent teams to Bihar, from where the crime branch sleuths arrested the suspect.

Police said that gang members are seasoned criminals and know that it is easy to track down the mobile phones if sold to anyone in India.

According to police, the inter-state gang must have targeted many cities in Maharashtra and that the custodial interrogation of the suspect will help in cracking more cases. The suspect was prodced before a local court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody till Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law Robert Vadra told the Enforcement Directorate (ED) that he used Google map to identify properties for purchase after one of his associates from Bikaner , Mahesh Nagar, brought land registry papers to him.

Mahesh Nagar is brother of Congress MLA from Haryana ’s Lalit Nagar, and was the authorised representative of Vadra’s Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd. Vadra had allegedly purchased four land parcels through Nagar and later sold them off at huge margins to Allegeny Finlease Pvt Ltd.

Based on Nagar’s statements, Vadra has been questioned multiple times by the investigating officers of the ED’s Jaipur zone. Sources said, Vadra has been evasive on the source of funds used to purchase these land parcels which were meant for rehabilitation of displaced persons of the Mahajan Field Firing Range.

After two days of questioning in Jaipur earlier this year in connection with the Bikaner land scam, the ED on February 15 had attached Vadra’s Sukhdev Vihar house besides other assets worth over Rs 4.62 crore.

380,['17/01/2020'],"Kolkata: Meet giraffes, zebras at Eco Park next year","File photos of giraffes at Alipore zoo from where animals will be brought to the New Town facility next year

KOLKATA: Giraffes and hippos in enclosures may greet visitors to Eco Park from next year. The West Bengal Zoo Authority has got the approval of master layout plan for ‘Harinalaya Mini Zoo’ at New Town from Central Zoo Authority (CZA) recently. The development makes it the 12th recognized mini zoo in Bengal.Though Harinalaya — spread over 10 acres — has been operating since 2016, the move by CZA finally gives it an official recognition.Talking to TOI, state zoo authority member secretary V K Yadav said that the zoo will house giraffes, hippos and zebras that will be shifted from the Alipore Zoological Gardens once the entire facility is ready by the end of this year. “Initially, we plan to bring four giraffes, four zebras and two hippos from Alipore zoo. But before that, the final enclosure designs need clearance from the CZA. The designs are ready and we hope to get an approval for the same from CZA by February,” Yadav said, adding that they will start the construction soon after that. “We are eyeing a deadline of 2020-end. If all goes well, the mini zoo will be fully operational from 2021,” he added.According to him, the mini zoo will also house turtles, an aviary and a pheasantry. Harinalaya is located beside gate number 6 of Eco Park and visitors now don’t have to shell out any additional fees to visit the place. The usual entry fee of Rs 30 per person, includes the charges to Harinalaya.Inaugurated in 2016, by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Harinalaya now houses a few spotted deer and barking deer. Though forest department had developed its plan, Hidco had allotted funds for it, said Yadav. “We also have plans to write to Hidco, seeking additional 10 acres from them so that the mini zoo can be developed in future,” said Yadav.Commenting further on the enclosure design, a senior official said that CZA gives specifications on enclosures for each and every animal. “So, before bringing the animals, we have to get sanctions for the final enclosure designs, which have been planned as per CZA guidelines, from the central authority,” the official added.This may ease some pressure on the Alipore zoo as well. A senior official had earlier said that the Alipore zoo is now flooded with rescued animals. “A zoo can’t display exotic animals and birds beyond a certain percentage of the total animals on display. Land is the need of the hour and we had earlier urged the agencies concerned to help us find land,” the official had said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73315266,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-479003,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/meet-giraffes-zebras-at-eco-park-next-year/articleshow/73309743.cms

TimesView Reservations have become a trump card for political parties, who unscrupulously wield it to secure support. It was never intended to be that way. Because they were so impoverished, the Constitution provided special benefits to backward classes and women through reservation with the aim of improving their condition. The system, based on caste, was only applicable for 10 years, but it failed to address backwardness and discrimination. At the start, only SCs and STs were included in this policy, but the 1980 Mandal Commission report, virtually made it a free for all. Now, a solution has become a problem and it refuses to go away.

BENGALURU: The clamour for reservation in government services and educational institutes in the state is growing and experts suggest it has a lot to do with the lack of jobs. While some castes are demanding a hike in reservation, others want to be included in the list of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST).The Valmiki community for instance has taken centre stage, seeking a hike in ST quota and threatening a stir if their demand is turned down. There is a long-standing demand by Kurubas and Kodavas to be included in the ST category, while nearly 25 other small caste groups have similar demands.Ironically, dominant agrarian communities like Lingayats are also exerting pressure on the government to recognize them as ‘backward’, just so they can avail quotas in education and government jobs. And there is a mad scramble to reserve private sector jobs for locals. In fact, the government is readying a bill to this effect — largely for political reasons as the Supreme Court has capped reservations at 50%.Experts say the scenario reflects the challenges these communities are facing in education and jobs and it stems from the inability to earn a stable income from the agrarian sector. With private sector jobs also dwindling, these agrarian communities see “quotas” as a form of “security” for the community.Sandeep Shastri, political analyst, said the rush for reservation or a higher percentage of reservations is not based on unbiased empirical data on the current level of backwardness of different caste groups.“We have not been able to publish the caste census conducted in the state for fear of political fallout,” Shastri said. “In today’s identity politics, each social group wants to wrest the maximum benefit for its members, again, without any rationale, scientific or evidence-based study of the relative deprivation in each social group. Thus, protest and influence politics appears to define and decide who gets how much and not whether they really deserve it.”Prof Harish Ramaswamy, another expert, said it largely has to do with employability especially in this age of globalisation. “There is a shrinking space for government jobs,” he said. “Private sector demands are not being met by the education we are offering. There is a mismatch that has led to freshers being unemployable. In order to overcome this shrinking job scenario, reservation has taken hold.

Representative image

BHOPAL: Despite a Supreme Court ban, acid is being sold in the city. Shopkeepers in many areas are selling it on the sly as toilet cleaner.

The main reason for sale of acid is that it is a cheap toilet cleaner and easily clears the stains on toilet tiles. Many locals argue that instead of ban on sale of acid, administration should find way to control its misuse.

Neha Saxena, a homemaker from Sharda Vihar, argued that a bottle of branded toilet cleaner costs around Rs 100- Rs 150, while a bottle of acid is available for less than Rs 50. Acid is more effective in removing floor stains. She said ban on acid results into its black marketing.

Ankit Trivedi, a college student, said that there are a number of shops that sell acid at Loha Bazaar near Peer Gate.

Cases of acid attacks have been reported in Bhopal in the past in May 2019, a 45-year-old man threw acid on his wife while she was returning home from the auto-parts shop where she worked at Hamidia Road in Hanumanganj locality at night.

The acid was so concentrated that the clothes of the woman were completely burnt. She collapsed on the road and the passer-byes covered her body with ‘gamchas’. The enraged locals thrashed the accused husband and he too fell unconscious.

Earlier in January 2019, a 32-year-old woman doctor, posted at AIIMS, was waylaid by bike-borne men and threatened of acid attack. The accused were asking her to withdraw the complaint, she registered against them.

Panaji: There is an immediate need to stop manual sewerage work and replace it with a mechanised cleaning system, said Manju Diler, a member of the National Commission for Safai Karmacharis, Union ministry of social justice and empowerment.

She was speaking at a meeting with the North Goa collector, directors of social welfare, municipality administration, Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) commissioner, deputy labour commissioner and other officials, held in Panaji on Thursday.

The objective of the meeting was to discuss and review welfare measures, work conditions and compensation given to sewerage workers.

“It is necessary to ensure that safety equipment is provided to sanitation workers,” she said. She discussed the minimum wages of the employees of Sulabh International and spoke about the latest development project entailing the laying of sewerage pipelines across the state.

Diler asked for the data pertaining to the promotion of sewerage workers working for urban local bodies such as municipalities, and discussed measures to be taken to improve and enhance their standard of living.

Director of social welfare, Umeshchandra Joshi said the Goa government was implementing various schemes for the betterment of sewerage workers. Awareness camps are aimed at educating sanitation workers about the schemes implemented for their welfare. Diler therefore suggested to organize more camps regularly to create more awareness about the schemes and measures for the workers with proper registration to inform to their office.

391,['17/01/2020'],"Old, defunct CCTVs fail to keep an eye on crime","This story is from January 17, 2020

Bhopal: The CCTV cameras installed by various agencies between 2009 and 2014 for surveillance in the city are hardly any help to police as they are not only obsolete but most of them have become defunct also.

Installed in phases from 2009 to 2014, the technology and specifications of these cameras have become outdated and provide poor results. About half of the cameras remain out-of-order most of the time.

Police scan CCTV footages after any major loot, accident or theft incidents to identity suspects. However, there was no help from these cameras in past one year and police relied on private CCTV cameras installed by people on their premises to find any clue during investigation.

Unlike the much-advanced CCTV cameras installed under the Integrated Traffic Management System (ITMS) under the Smart City project, gathering footage on any crime incident from these surveillance cameras is a tedious job as cops have to manually search for footages staring at the screen for hours together.

On January 3, two scooterists snatched a mobile phone from a Delhi-based trainee chartered accountant (CA) while he was talking over phone outside his hotel in MP Nagar Zone I. He ran after the robbers till Thaddaram Complex trisection, but they sped away towards Jyoti Square. The CCTV cameras at Thaddaram Complex trisection and Jyoti Square failed to give any clue to MP Nagar police when they scanned the footages.

SHO MP Nagar Manish Rai said the footages were grainy and provided no help at all.

Similarly, police struggled to get any help from surveillance CCTV cameras while investigating the abduction of 3-year-old Varun Meena in Kolar and the loot bid with a jeweller’s driver in Kotwali area last year. In many hit-and-run accidents, cops struggled to find the accused driver due to lack of good cameras.

Senior police officers wishing anonymity said the project to install 10,000 new CCTV cameras across the state is withheld due to shortage of funds.

Cops maintained that the number of cameras is not adequate to cover various left out vital parts of the city and at least 3-4 times more cameras are needed. City police have already sent a proposal to PHQ seeking installation of at least 1,000 more CCTV cameras, but no action has been taken so far.

Police officers maintained that it was the private cameras that provided help in all the major crime cases cracked by the police during the past one year. Under ‘Bhopal Eye’ app initiative, police are now encouraging people to install CCTVs on their premises and provide the live feed to police by linking it with police on the app.

Police have marked strategic locations across the city and identified private buildings where people are being asked to install good quality night vision cameras on their premises so that police may get help in case of any criminal activity.

To encourage people for CCTV installation, police are holding meetings with members of various organisations like nursing homes associations, religious institutions, schools/colleges, petrol pumps, jewellers, covered campus colonies societies, coaching institutes and banks. Police plan to get live feed from at least 5,000 cameras through public participation under the ‘Bhopal Eye’ campaign.

DIG Irshad Wali admitted that the quality of surveillance CCTV cameras is poor. The proposal to increase the number of CCTV cameras in the city has been sent to PHQ, he said, adding, police are making people aware to install good quality night vision cameras on their premises for their own safety. It’s a win-win situation for people and police, if they share the live feed with police. He said that as of now police have got live feed of around 500 CCTV cameras under Bhopal Eye initiative.

PATNA: Police have launched a manhunt to arrest 12 people who were named in an FIR in connection with the murder of a milk trader , Manish Kumar (20), who was beaten to death at Gosaipur diara village under the Akilpur police station area in western Patna on Wednesday night. The victim was a resident of Kasimchak village under the same police station area.

Police said one Chunnu Kumar of Sultanpur village under the Danapur police station area was named as the main accused in the FIR lodged by victim’s father Vishwanath Rai with Akilpur police station on Thursday.

SHO (incharge) of Akilpur police station Deo Kumar Prasad said multiple injury marks were found on the head and the body of Manish. “Manish and Chunnu had a fight at least two months back over a monetary dispute,” he said, adding Manish had lent money to Chunnu which the latter failed to pay back.

Prasad said Manish was on way to riverine belt from Akilpur to collect milk when he was intercepted by more than six people. “He was riding a bike when several people armed with rods and sticks attacked him. They fled the spot after committing the crime. Manish was taken to a hospital where the doctors declared him brought arrival,” the SHO said, adding raids were on to arrest the accused.

393,['17/01/2020'],Karnataka cabinet expansion only after Yediyurappa’s Davos visit,"This story is from January 17, 2020

BS Yediyurappa (File Photo)

BENGALURU: Chief minister BS Yediyurappa is likely to induct new ministers into his cabinet only after he returns from Davos, Switzerland, on January 25.

Yediyurappa will leave for Davos on January 19 to participate in the World Economic Forum’s 50th annual meet.

Sources say Yediyurappa is keen on expanding his cabinet before he leaves for Davos and is still trying to secure the green signal from BJP national president Amit Shah. However, Shah has cold-shouldered Yediyurappa’s several requests for a meeting to discuss the issue.

Shah is scheduled to visit Karnataka on January 18 to participate in a pro-Citizenship (Amendment) Act rally in Hubballi and the CM plans to corner him there. But, given the time constraint, Yediyurappa is likely to put off the exercise till he returns from Davos even if Shah extends approval.

“Even if Shah gives the green signal, Yediyurappa will have less than 24 hours to expand his cabinet,” a source said. “It is highly unlikely he will rush through the process of inducting ministers. Also, his presence is required to douse disgruntlement which is bound to arise once the new ministers are sworn in.”

The CM and the party high command are on different pages as far as cabinet expansion is concerned. While Yediyurappa is hell-bent on keeping his promise of inducting all the newly elected MLAs, who switched from Congress and JD(S) to the BJP, Shah is keen on sharing vacant berths equally between loyal MLAs and the new entrants. There are 16 cabinet berths vacant.

Shah, sources said, is of the opinion that giving 12 berths to the turncoats will lead to heartburn among loyalists and it will impact the party’s prospects in the next election. “Moreover, he is of the opinion that none of the turncoats have mass appeal, nor do they have any administrative experience. This, he thinks, will impact governance,” said a source.

This has resulted in a deadlock and the issue has dragged on for a month now.

Colva: Three occupants escaped unhurt after the vehicle in which they were travelling landed in the Sal river early Thursday morning.

Margao police personnel, who were conducting checks of vehicles as part of their night patrolling duties on a small bridge connecting Margao to Benaulim, rushed to assist the youths.

Constables Suraj Velip, Hiresh Bhuttewadkar and home guard Divakar threw a rope into the water and pulled out the trio who had clambered onto the bonnet of the sinking vehicle.

As no third party was involved in the incident, no case has been registered by the police.

In his statement to the police, the vehicle driver said that he was attending a party at a popular establishment in Benaulim. At around 2am, he left the party along with two female friends in order to proceed home.

Police said that as the driver was proceeding to Margao, he lost control of the vehicle, rammed into a partly damaged retaining wall and landed into the river.

A family member later arranged for a crane to haul the vehicle.

JAIPUR: An Army jawan from Nagaur was killed in J&K after getting trapped in an avalanche caused by heavy snowfall in the valley on January 13. The Army launched a search and rescue operation but he could not be saved. His remains were found under the snow and will be brought to his village in Kuchaman city in Nagaur district by Friday. Four other jawans were also killed in the same accident.

Representative image

PANAJI: The Goa Real Estate Regulatory Authority ( Rera ) has ordered a Salcete-based real estate entity to pay Rs 25 lakh to a complainant with 10% interest per annum from June 2016.

Acting on a complaint by Clifford D’Mello in July 2018, Rera member Pramod Kamat passed the order asking the respondent company to refund the deposit amount with interest.

The complainant had booked a flat at Pedda, Varca, with built-up area of 56.3 sqm in a project by the builder in April 2016 by paying an advance of Rs 25 lakh.

The project did not start even two years after the payment was made.

Since the project did not start, the complainant requested the builder to refund his money with interest. The builder was not willing to refund the advance. He gave false assurances whenever the complainant sent messages on his cellphone, the order read.

He also produced receipts of the payments made to the builder more than two years ago.

A notice was issued to the builder. During the hearing held in June 2016, the respondent agreed to refund the deposit with interest but he did not do so even after the complainant followed up with a reminder.

Rera then issued a showcause notice as to why a penalty should not be levied. It directed the respondent to remain present in the office.

The respondent sought a month’s time and the next date of the hearing was fixed. He turned volte-face and came up with a case that the complainant was an investor and not a home buyer, and that no relief could be granted to the complainant by this authority as all his claims were barred by the law of limitation.

Rera held that the complainant was not an investor but a bona fide intended purchaser, and that the respondent was duty-bound to refund him.

398,['17/01/2020'],Chennai: Congress free to leave alliance said Durai Murugan,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Durai Murugan

CHENNAI: The Congress-DMK ties took a further beating on Wednesday after DMK treasurer S Durai Murugan said the Congress was welcome to quit the alliance and that the ally’s exit would in no way affect his party’s prospects in elections ahead. While, this is the first time, a senior DMK functionary has asked its electoral partner to exit the alliance if it so desired, the Congress has maintained a studious silence. The Tamil Nadu Congress Committee chief K S Alagiri has refused to react beyond his earlier statement that the alliance with DMK was on.

A recent statement by Alagiri that DMK had “not adhered to coalition dharma” had upset the DMK leadership. Congress councillors had indulged in cross-voting in the recent rural local body elections, leading to DMK losing a district panchayat chairmanship. This had upset the DMK leadership, provoking it to boycott the CAA meeting convened by AICC president Sonia Gandhi on Monday.

In the AIADMK alliance too, all is not well. On Thursday, senior minister D Jayakumar remarked rather cryptically, ""anything is possible in politics."" This was in reply to a question from reporters in Chennai about the possibility of Congress switching to the AIADMK alliance.

On Pongal day, Durai Murugan told reporters in Vellore, “If they want to quit, let them do so. How are we concerned? It is no loss for us.” He further added, “Congress does not have a vote bank to make a dent in our party’s prospects. Do they have votes to make an impact?” asked Durai Murugan sarcastically.

On former Union minister T R Baalu saying only time will tell about whether the DMK-Congress alliance will continue, Durai Murugan said, “Baalu said only time will tell. But I have answered the question.” Sivaganga MP and former Union minister P Chidambaram’s son Karti Chidambaram, joined issue, taking to Twitter to ask why Durai Murugan did not say this during the Vellore Lok Sabha election which his son Kathir Anand won with a slender margin of 8000 votes. “Why didn’t this wisdom dawn before the Vellore parliamentary byelection?” tweeted Karti.

Meanwhile on Thursday, Virudhunagar MP Manickam Tagore said the DMK-Congress alliance was the best for the Lok Sabha elections in Tamil Nadu. “What Alagiri said was only regarding the rural local body elections. Our party cadres are upset that they did not get a chance to become even a deputy chief in district panchayat unions,” Tagore told TOI. He said Alagiri had only expressed his concern about the allotment of posts in the local body elections. “Stalin has not spoken anything. But, when DMK leaders criticise the Congress party, I have a suspicion that they do not have Stalin’s interests at heart and don’t want him to become a CM of TN,” he said.

IUML leader and DMK ally K M Khader Moideen attempted to cool tempers by stating, “What Stalin says is important. Has he said anything?” The former Vellore MP said there was only one leader for the DMK and that only his views mattered.

Representative image

NASHIK: The central crime branch of Nashik police successfully tracked down and arrested a suspect accused of killing a man inside a medical shop in Kalwa of Thane district.

Commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare-Patil on Thursday said ground work and human intelligence were two important factors that helped them catch the suspect — identified as Sarfaraj Ansari (29), a resident of Jharkhand. A case against Ansari was also registered at Nashik Road police station in 2017.

The suspect is accused of killing Premsingh Kishorsing Rajpurohit (26), a relative of shopowner. The suspect broke into the shop to steal at midnight of December 27, 2017, only to find the victim inside the shop.

As Rajpurohit tried to stop Ansari, the latter pulled out a gun and shot two rounds one of which hit the former.

“Our men had no information other than the two photographs in which Ansari was seen with two women. We had no clue about the whereabouts of the women or the suspect. But assistant sub-inspector Dattatray Kadnoor and constable Gangadhar Kedar identified the women and interrogated them that led us to the suspect,” Nangre-Patil said.

“It was established that the suspect came to Nashik and then went to Jharkhand. We were waiting for his return and had also sent teams to the track him down,” a police officer said.

The police then got to know that the suspect was coming to Nashik and accordingly a trap was laid at Nilgiri Baug.

“We nabbed him on Thursday morning. The suspect will now be handed over to the Thane police when they come here for his custody,” another senior police officer said. Commissioner of police has announced a cash reward of Rs 25,000 to every policeman involved in cracking the case.

“It is not known if the women are involved in the crime. We have seized a country-made pistol, three rounds, cash and valuable, including motorcycle, amounting to Rs 64,390 from Ansari. Further interrogation will be carried out by the Thane police,” the officer said, adding that the suspect has been remanded in police custody till January 18.

401,['17/01/2020'],700 girls yet to get financial aid under Kanya Vivah Yojana,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Indore: Over 700 girls, who got married under ‘Mukhya Mantri Kanya Vivah Evam Nikah Yojana' in this financial year are still awaiting financial aid they are entitled to under the scheme. The amount adds up to around Rs3.5 crore.

As per social justice department data, 1083 girls have tied the knot under Mukhya Mantri Kanya Vivah Evam Nikah Yojana in current fiscal and are entitled to Rs51,000 each (Organizers of these mass marriage ceremonies too are entitled to Rs3,000 per couple for making required arrangements).

“In current financial year, we have distributed payment to 356 girls. For payment to remaining 727 girls, grant from state government is awaited. We have written to senior officials on various occasions to release the same,” social justice department joint director, Suchita Tirkey Beck said.

The main reason behind the delay is additional financial burden being borne by government, said a senior administrative official on condition of anonymity. After Congress came to power in state, it increased the aid amount from Rs28,000, to Rs51,000, as it had promised in its poll manifesto. The increase in amount has led to increase in number of eligible girls solemnizing their marriage under the scheme to avail the benefit. All this has resulted in additional financial burden on state government. At present, over Rs100 crore is yet to be distributed among over 20,000 eligible girls across the state, the official said.

This delay in payment has started a political blame game between the BJP and Congress.

“Congress has come to power by making false promises including waiving off agriculture loans in 10 days of making the government, else chief minister would be changed. Also, Kamal Nath increased payment under Kanyadan and Nikah Yojana but hundreds of beneficiaries are waiting for payment,” BJP city president Gopikrishna Nema told TOI.

He said that Congress government has shut many schemes of Shivraj Singh Chouhan government and on the same lines they have released a ‘calendar’ (fixed nine days for Hindu marriages and nine for Muslims) to discourage mass marriages under the said scheme.

“In 15-years of BJP regime, many ‘already married’ couples availed benefits of the scheme by participating in mass marriage ceremonies sponsored by the then government, resulting in huge corruption. I have lodged a complaint that marriages performed under the scheme in this financial year be verified,” MPCC secretary Sanjay Bakliwal told TOI.

He said that by releasing the calendar, government would be able to check such corruption as apart from verification by the concerned departments, the beneficiaries would have to submit an affidavit too.

MEERUT: The carcass of an adult freshwater dolphin, bearing deep harpoon wounds, was found on the banks of the Ganga River inside protected Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary near here, reducing the count of the mammal to 35 in the region. The killing of the mammal prompted the Uttar Pradesh’s forest department to register an FIR and launch a crackdown against illegal fishing on the Ganga stretch which has been earmarked as Ramsar site for the conservation of dolphins.

The mammal’s carcass was found near Jalalpur Jora village in Hastinapur division. It comes days before state’s chief minister Yogi Adityanath is scheduled to visit Hastinapur sanctuary.

The authorities claimed the body “seemed a bit old and the mammal could have been attacked somewhere else.” The post-mortem examination report stated that the death was caused due to the harpoon attack, which spoke volumes about the security of the national aquatic animal in the region.

Divisional forest officer (DFO) of Meerut division Aditi Sharma said, “Hastinapur sanctuary is divided into five districts and it is not clear where the dolphin was killed. The post-mortem report revealed that the harpoon had hit the spine of the mammal killing it instantly. Since dolphin is not used for human consumption, the hunters/poachers didn’t take it away and the carcass reached Hastinapur river bank. We are in the process of filing an FIR against the unknown poacher.”

Meanwhile, neighbouring Bijnor’s DFO M Semmaran has launched a drive against illegal fishing in the region under his jurisdiction. “Apart from this drive, we have also launched awareness campaign among villagers about the dolphins. We have also arrested three persons involved in illegal fishing along with their nets,” he said.

UP’s forest department and WWF India are working on a project for conservation of freshwater dolphins, and the stakeholders were upbeat with the recent census held in October last year, which showed three healthy calves adding to the population of 33 this year. In all 36 dolphins were counted in the census.

Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary is a 2,073 square-km of stretch along the Ganga and comprises regions of five West UP districts, Bijnor, Meerut, Hapur, Amroha and Muzaffarnagar. Ramsar Site is from Garh Mukteshwar to Narora in Bulandshahr.

Meerut’s DFO Sharma said, “The initiative to conserve dolphins at the Ramsar Site had begun in 2015 with 30 dolphins. In the last census, the number had risen to 36 and most of them were spotted in Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary. Considering the fact that this mammal gives birth only once in a couple of years, the rise in its population was quite encouraging and three calves also show the favourable habitat for them. But this death is unfortunate and a thorough investigation is underway.”

Ramsar sites are considered to be of national importance for conserving biological diversity.

Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot

JAIPUR: The Press Council of India (PCI) has taken suo motu cognisance of a comment by chief minister Ashok Gehlot that if the media does not carry government news it will not get advertisements .

Gehlot made the remark light-heartedly while ending a press conference last month. The PCI has now issued notice to the state chief secretary and sought a reply on the CM’s “disconcerting” remark.

Gehlot’s remark has invited criticism from BJP state president Satish Poonia as well. In a press conference held on December 16 last year, Gehlot allegedly said that ""vigyapan chahte ho toh hamari khabar dikhao"" (if you want advertisements, publish or telecast our news).

""Such statement is contrary to the values of democracy and affects the reliability and freedom of media. A notice for reply has been issued to the chief secretary of Rajasthan in this regard,"" the PCI said in a release.

Poonia said Gehlot should stop threatening the media to hide his failures and should instead start concentrating on his state's affairs which have turned worse in the last 13 months of the Congress government.

Poonia said that the media, described as the ""fourth pillar of democracy"" has been bringing out both success and failure stories of the state government. Gehlot is the first chief minister of the state to have received such a notice which gives an impression that the media faces threat under his tenure. This also raises a question mark on the person who claims himself as a follower of Gandhian philosophy, he added.

He also said that Rajasthan has joined the list of states which top the crime rankings, while Gehlot, despite being the home minister, is unable to control the crime rate.

Similarly, Gehlot has also dismissed death of over 100 children in the state as a minor issue. Besides, farmers have suffered huge losses from a locust attack on their crops, for which the Chief Minister has not announced any compensation, he said.

NAGPUR: In a record of last five years, Nagpur University would be conferring highest number of degrees in the 107th convocation on Saturday, where its alumnus and now Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde, had consented to be the chief guest.NU would be bestowing a total of 64,993 degrees at the function to be held at Suresh Bhat Sabhagruh from 10.30am, which included 746 PhDs, 13,037 undergraduates, 50,936 postgraduates and one DLitt to be conferred on Shrihari Chava from the commerce and management faculty.All though many legal luminaries were part of NU’s convocation ceremonies in the past, no CJI had ever visited it. “Former attorney General MC Settalvad was the chief guest in 1955 convocation, Justice MN Venkatchaliah had occupied main chair in 1980, and justice MN Chandurkar had also graced the occasion once. But this time, we’re lucky to have the CJI as our alumnus, who will be delivering the keynote address,” NU media coordinator Shyam Dhond informed.Terming CJI’s presence as a proud moment for the entire university, vice chancellor SP Kane said his elevation to the top post should be added to the NU achievements during inspection by NAAC and other agencies. “Unfortunately, such achievements isn’t counted while awarding the grades. Many of our alumni have achieved great heights and are occupying prominent positions globally,” said Kane, who was flanked by pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande, registrar Neeraj Khaty, finance officer Raju Hiwse, Board of examination and evaluation director Prafulla Sable and four deans.Like the 106th convocation, this time too, NU has drastically scaled down the number of medals, it used to award till 105th ceremony. This time, it would be awarding just 185 medals and prizes, of which 158 are gold, nine silver and 18 prizes. In 105th event, over 457 medals and prizes were awarded that included 312 gold, 43 silver and 102 prizes.Ayushi Khandelwal, who cleared MBA from Dr Ambedkar Institute of Management Studies and Research, will be getting highest number of gold medals (7), followed by Sayali Bhave (LLB-5 years) of NU’s Dr Ambedkar Law College and Sakharam Mandpe (MA Ambedkar Thoughts) from NU’s Ambedkar Thought Department with six gold medals each. Madhuri Ghugguskar from NU’s Postgraduate Education Department has won five gold medals for topping the MEd exams.Kane informed that after the convocation, NU plans to shift some of its offices to the new premises near its campus. He informed that at existing premises in front of Maharajbagh square, they had decided to use the backside of its administrative building for convocation in future. “The old offices earlier housing printing press would be demolished and cement flooring would be extended till the end. A dome shaped cover would be placed at the top. Same venue used to have host the convocation in the past. The old premises of College Section would be refurbished and would be used as a guesthouse for the NU employees and other guests.”Informing on suspended professor Shoma Sen, who is in Pune police’s custody in connection with her alleged involvement in Koregaon-Bhima violence, the VC said NU can’t go ahead with its internal inquiry, unless Pune cops officially provide them list of offences under which she was arrested. “They told us that probe was underway and therefore they can’t handover such sensitive details to anyone,” he said.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73309771,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-393514,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-to-bestow-highest-no-of-degrees-in-last-5-years-in-107th-convocation/articleshow/73309771.cms

Trichy: City Wide Inclusive Sanitation (CWIS) Trichy celebrated “sanitary Pongal” with sanitary workers to spread awareness on the importance of personal and public hygiene in Ganesapuram locality under Ponmalai zone of Trichy corporation on Wednesday.

CWIS is a global project for which Trichy was selected as one of the four towns and cities across the nation to improve the existing sanitary infrastructure. Ganesapuram was once an open defecation-prone locality which eradicated it through public participation and behavioural change. CWIS said Ganesapuram was selected for the sanitary Pongal to recognise the remarkable turnaround. With 75% of the residents here being sanitary workers, the objective of the celebration was to encourage the workers to pursue the best sanitary practices. As many of the sanitary workers were found reluctant to use safety gear while on duty, messages promoting its importance in safeguarding lives were conveyed at the celebrations. Competitions such as running race, Uri adi (pot breaking contest) and kolam contest were organised, each incorporating a sanitation aspect.

“In running race, participants have to wash their hands properly before the event started,” organiser Sugantha Priscilla, senior specialist, Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS) said. In Uri Adi, sanitary awareness messages were placed inside the pot which the participant had to read out aloud after breaking it with a stick.

Representative image

MUMBAI: CBI told the Bombay high court on Thursday that the search to retrieve a weapon allegedly used to kill rationalist Narendra Dabholkar which was thrown into the Thane creek , is nearing completion.

Additional solicitor general Anil Singh sought at least 15 days to complete the dredging operation, being conducted by a foreign agency, from a bench of Justices Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Riyaz Chagla. The high court is monitoring the CBI probe into Dabholkar’s case and that by the state police’s special investigation team into the killing of CPI leader Govind Pansare .

Additional solicitor general Anil Singh submitted CBI’s probe report. It stated that the dredging work is nearing completion. “The area of the creek is mostly covered, except for a small part which is affected by high tide and low tide,” said Singh.

The judges also remarked they are “anxious” that the SIT has not been able to make headway to find the absconding accused in the Pansare murder case.

The high court observations came after perusing SIT’s probe progress report submitted by senior advocate Ashok Mundargi.

The judges noted the report states that a team is camping in Bangalore to “ascertain whether a commonality is there” in the killings of Pansare and journalist-activist Gauri Lankesh.

It also informed teams have been dispatched to Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Goa to launch a search for the absconding accused. The court will take an update in both the cases on February 13.

Dabholkar was shot dead on August 20, 2013, by unidentified motorcycle-borne assailants in Pune while on his morning walk. He was 68. Pansare and his wife were shot at on February 16, 2015, in Kolhapur during their morning walk. While his wife survived, the veteran CPI leader died four days later.

410,['17/01/2020'],Rajasthan: Press Council takes note of CM Ashok Gehlot comment on advertisements,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot

JAIPUR: The Press Council of India (PCI) has taken suo motu cognisance of a comment by chief minister Ashok Gehlot that if the media does not carry government news it will not get advertisements .

Gehlot made the remark light-heartedly while ending a press conference last month. The PCI has now issued notice to the state chief secretary and sought a reply on the CM’s “disconcerting” remark.

Gehlot’s remark has invited criticism from BJP state president Satish Poonia as well. In a press conference held on December 16 last year, Gehlot allegedly said that ""vigyapan chahte ho toh hamari khabar dikhao"" (if you want advertisements, publish or telecast our news).

""Such statement is contrary to the values of democracy and affects the reliability and freedom of media. A notice for reply has been issued to the chief secretary of Rajasthan in this regard,"" the PCI said in a release.

Poonia said Gehlot should stop threatening the media to hide his failures and should instead start concentrating on his state's affairs which have turned worse in the last 13 months of the Congress government.

Poonia said that the media, described as the ""fourth pillar of democracy"" has been bringing out both success and failure stories of the state government. Gehlot is the first chief minister of the state to have received such a notice which gives an impression that the media faces threat under his tenure. This also raises a question mark on the person who claims himself as a follower of Gandhian philosophy, he added.

He also said that Rajasthan has joined the list of states which top the crime rankings, while Gehlot, despite being the home minister, is unable to control the crime rate.

Similarly, Gehlot has also dismissed death of over 100 children in the state as a minor issue. Besides, farmers have suffered huge losses from a locust attack on their crops, for which the Chief Minister has not announced any compensation, he said.

NEW DELHI: Listing diplomatic isolation of Pakistan and keeping it under pressure of blacklisting by FATF as measures to tackle Pak-based terror, Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat on Thursday called for strong and concerted global action against states sponsoring terrorism .

In an address at the Raisina Dialogue, Gen Rawat said there is a need to take a hard-line approach in dealing with terrorism, the way the US went after terror groups after the 9/11 terror attacks.

“As long as there are states which sponsor terrorism, we will have to live with the menace. We need to take the bull by its horns. We have to bring an end to terrorism and that can only happen the way Americans started after 9/11,” he said.

Gen Rawat suggested that India should start counter-radicalisation programmes by targeting the “right” persons. “We have to address the ideology of radicalisation,” he further said.

412,['17/01/2020'],It’s business as usual for some meat stalls despite Thiruvalluvar Day ban,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Trichy: Despite the ban imposed by Trichy Corporation against functioning of meat stalls and the sale of meat in the city on account of Thiruvalluvar Day on Thursday, a few meat stalls here did function and business went on as usual. Though the civic body officials are entitled to seize the meat and initiate actions against meat stalls that defy the ban, sanitary department of the civic body did not take any action.

As per G.O. 45 dated January 23, 1980, of the Rural Development and Local Administration Department, the state government has ordered the closure of meat stalls and slaughterhouses on three days annually-Thiruvalluvar day, Vallalar day and Mahavir Jayanti.

Following the guidelines, Trichy Corporation, a few days back had issued notices to around 400 meat and poultry stalls in the city prohibiting them from doing business. However, at least 5-10 shops in Ponmalai zone of Trichy Corporation located in Ponmalaipatti were kept open.

“Notifying about the ban on sale of meat during Thiruvalluvar day through newspapers and letting the meat stalls function as usual is a useless exercise,” KC Neelamegam, a resident of Ponmalaipatti said.

With the two abattoirs of Trichy Corporation located at Gandhi Market and G Corner remaining shut on Thursday, the sale of meat in mutton stalls have also raised questions about where the goats were slaughtered and whether those premises were hygienic. While meat stalls in Karumandapam, Gandhi market and Cantonment were found closed, locals said that those in Ponmalaipatti violated the ban on Thursday.

“We were not aware of the functioning of shops. Action will be taken against the meat stalls that defied the ban,” an official with Ponmalai zone of Trichy Corporation said.

Bhopal: With the rate of inflation touching 7%, its highest level in the last five years, prices of almost all the essential commodities have gone up burning a deep hole in the pockets of people, especially the middle class. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) has added to their woes.

Market experts said coarse cereals and pulses have been driving food inflation since the beginning of 2019. While onion prices set the markets ablaze, spiralling prices of other vegetables, like tomato, have only made life miserable for consumers.

For the past many weeks, onion was beyond the reach of the aam aadmi. “Last month, it was sold at a rate of Rs 120 a kg in Bhopal. Good quality onion is still being sold at Rs 50 a kg. For some time, even potato price had shot up, but onion, garlic and ginger are the real cause for veggie inflation,” ,” said Rashmi Inamdar, a housewife in Bhopal.

Ashish Jain, a grain merchant, said: “Rs 10 hike in per kg of wheat is a huge increase. This commodity has affected all and sundry.”

State general secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Udhyog Vyapar Mandal Navneet Agrawal said, “A lot of elements related to inflation are controlled by the government, but it seems to be least interested in controlling the inflation.”

Agarwal said the government should have anticipated loss of onion crops through its huge network of officials and should have placed import orders accordingly. ""It delayed the process,” he said.

In the past four months, prices of wheat, edible oil, moong, LPG cylinder and several other fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) have gone up.

RK Gupta, state president of the LPG dealers' association, said: “The domestic LPG cylinder, which was available at a rate of Rs 581 in August last year, is being sold at Rs 781 this month. Similarly, the LPG cylinder used for commercial purpose went up to Rs 1246.50 in January this year from Rs 1,011 in August last year.”

Besides, there has also been an increase of 5% to 6% in cost of medicines which are not in the list of drug price control order. Most of the manufacturers are taking advantage of this, sources said. Lalit Jain, a wholesaler of medicines, said: ""There is also an increase of 3% to 4% in the price of drugs to fight against cancer.”

Jain, also president of Bhopal Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said it has been observed that the GST is also responsible for the inflation. “I am not saying that it is the only element responsible for inflation, but definitely it is responsible for it.”

Representative image

MADURAI: Setting aside the conviction and sentence awarded to a person in a dowry death case, Madras high court has remitted the case back to the trial court saying it had convicted him without giving an opportunity to defend himself. Appellant Gnanavel and the deceased Gomathi were married in 2006. The prosecution case is that during the marriage her parents promised to give 15 sovereigns gold jewellery as dowry but gave only 11 sovereigns. On one occasion, Gomathi had gone to her parents’ house and informed them that she was being tortured by her husband for the four sovereigns.

On April 7, 2007, there was a quarrel between the couple and the neighbours pacified them. Later in the day, Gnanavel strangled his wife to death using a rope. Oomatchikulam police registered a case and arrested him. The Madurai mahila court in an order on October 20, 2014 convicted and sentenced him to undergo 10 years imprisonment under section 304B (dowry death) of IPC. The appellant filed an appeal before HC Madurai bench in 2014 challenging the order. On perusal of the submissions made on either side, Justice M Nirmal Kumar observed that the brother, father of Gomathi and a villager have categorically stated about the appellant subjecting her to cruelty and harassment.

The judge observed that the RDO who conducted an inquiry had in his reports confirmed the unnatural death and gave a categorical finding that there was demand for dowry, harassment and cruelty leading to the death of the woman. The judge said the VAO and panchayat president have also stated about the confession. Considering all these facts the trial court had convicted the appellant under IPC section 304B, without extending him any opportunity to defend himself. Hence the judge said it was necessary to give the appellant that opportunity in the interest of justice.

415,['17/01/2020'],2 finished projects take Trichy up 3 spots in smart cities ranking,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Trichy: Trichy corporation has slightly improved its position in the recent ranking of Tamil Nadu’s smart cities compared to November. With two smart city projects completed, it has now been placed at the eighth position, up three spots from the eleventh and last position it found itself in among the city corporations selected for the programme two months ago.

The smart cities mission was introduced by the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) in 2015 to improve the urban infrastructure of cities and set a benchmark for it. Till January 2018, 11 cities from the state were selected for the initiative based on the innovative project ideas proposed by the urban local bodies. At the latest review meeting held on January 10 at Chennai, the performance and ranking of smart cities based on the execution and completion of projects were discussed. Since the urban local body here had completed two projects — World War memorial beautification and green space development — in December, Trichy was able to scale the rankings to 8 this month. The city has 13 smart city mission projects in the execution stage.

“But Trichy is dragging its feet in expediting the major smart city projects such as biomining. Poor planning by the authorities is costing the city valuable time,” Subash Chandran, a resident of Woraiyur said. As cities like Madurai, Erode and Tiruppur have completed only one smart city project each, they were placed after Trichy in the ranking. Coimbatore, Chennai and Thoothukudi have secured the first three spots followed by Salem, Tirunelveli, Thanjavur and Vellore. Official sources in Trichy corporation blamed legal hurdles for the delay in the execution of Chathiram bus stand redevelopment and multi-level car parking (MLCP) projects. “Chennai and Coimbatore cities were selected for smart cities mission in 2016 itself, but Trichy was selected for the scheme only in 2017,” an official source added. However, though Thoothukudi corporation was also selected along with Trichy in 2017, it has found a place among the top three.

NEW DELHI: In 2015, when the assembly elections neared, very few voters in Delhi were aware of how severe the problem of air pollution had become. At the time, the city only had seven air monitoring stations and the now easily recognised benchmark, CPCB’s Air Quality Index , or AQI, was yet to be launched. Five years later, pollution has acquired a social dimension of its own — so much so that it has become an election issue.Since 2015, Delhi has added 31 more air quality monitoring stations, an indication that the problem is regarded with the seriousness it deserves. Last month, the United Residents Joint Action (URJA), an umbrella body of residents’ welfare associations, released a nine-point People’s Manifesto on Clean Air 2020, signifying that RWAs are becoming vocal about the urgency in finding solutions to the capital’s bad air. The three prominent political parties in the fray, namely the Aam Aadmi Party, Congress and BJP, have agreed to incorporate points from URJA’s manifesto in their own.Atul Goyal, president, URJA, disclosed that its manifesto was drafted after consulting a number of RWAs over three-four years. “Construction dust and vehicular pollution are problems throughout the year. They affect the whole of Delhi,” observed Goyal. “We have not had any respite from these two woes. In order to tackle Delhi’s air pollution, the state government needs to be committed to the cause of decongesting the city, switching to cleaner fuels, reducing vehicles on the road and improving public transport. Our green manifesto also asks for better cooperation with neighbouring states instead of indulging in a blame game.”Amit Aggarwal, a Vasant Kunj resident, said the public had begun to contribute to the fight against pollution, but the government needed to do a lot more to boost Delhi’s air quality. “I got rid of my 15-year-old car though it was in perfect running condition and I used it for only a kilometre or two each day,” the IT consultant said. “As a citizen, I did my bit, but I am not seeing the returns in terms of improved air quality. Since so much more obviously needs to be done, why not tie the perks of MLAs to air quality in some manner?”In New Friends Colony, which falls in the Okhla assembly constituency, people complain about the area’s consistently high AQI. Okhla is one among 13 pollution hotspots identified by Delhi Pollution Control Committee in 2019. The others are Narela, Bawana, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, Dwarka, Wazirpur, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, R K Puram, Jahangirpuri and Ashok Vihar.Madhavi Sachar, who lives in New Friends Colony, said people were becoming more conscious of pollution but felt the government needed to act strong a for sustained fight. “Measures like cars with odd-even licence plates using the road on alternate days raise awareness and cut emissions, but it’s tough to say what is being done in concrete terms to counter pollution,” she said. “Political parties now know they cannot get away with ignoring pollution.”In Dwarka, numerous anti-pollution protests have taken place in the last five years. From strong voices against felling trees to build the Dwarka Expressway to demanding the Bharat Vandana Park as an eco space, residents have been trying to stave off the reduction in green cover in the sub-city. “We are vocal because the government has to take strong measures to preserve trees and improve the air quality. So far, only the reverse is happening,” said V Selvarajan, a local.Many people feel air pollution as an election imperative is discussed only by the elite, with voters in the economically lower categories focused more on existential problems like water, electricity and sewage. “You may not see people in Seelampur or Jahangirpuri worrying about pollution so much. Those who are anxious about the air quality are too few to make an impact on the elections,” rued Bhavreen Kandhari in Defence Colony.Kandhari, however, is happy air pollution has emerged as a talking point now. “The state government is taking notice of the protests and the voices against the bad air.

From strong voices against felling trees to build the Dwarka Expressway to demanding the Bharat Vandana Park as an eco space, residents have been trying to stave off the reduction in green cover in the sub-city. “We are vocal because the government has to take strong measures to preserve trees and improve the air quality. So far, only the reverse is happening,” said V Selvarajan, a local.Many people feel air pollution as an election imperative is discussed only by the elite, with voters in the economically lower categories focused more on existential problems like water, electricity and sewage. “You may not see people in Seelampur or Jahangirpuri worrying about pollution so much. Those who are anxious about the air quality are too few to make an impact on the elections,” rued Bhavreen Kandhari in Defence Colony.Kandhari, however, is happy air pollution has emerged as a talking point now. “The state government is taking notice of the protests and the voices against the bad air. We expect the party that comes to power to focus on decongesting Delhi, reducing air pollution and improving waste management,” said a hopeful Kandhari.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73314519,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-340357,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-delhis-toxic-air-may-not-let-contenders-breathe-easy/articleshow/73310027.cms

MEERUT: With the arrest of four Delhi residents, UP police on Thursday claimed to have cracked a sensational robbery which took place in Meerut’s upscale Central Market last month. It comes two days after the jewelers’ association threatened a complete shutdown over rising incidents of robberies in the region.

All the arrested youths, including kingpin Akshya Sharma, are from the national capital, and are said to be involved in at least four recent robberies, including two in Delhi. “From them, we recovered looted jewellery worth Rs 25 lakh and cash to the tune of Rs 11 lakh,” a senior police officer said.

According to police, the gang took “inspiration” from a television crime show on how to dodge police trail and pull off a robbery without leaving surveillance clues that could lead the police to them.

“They disposed of the clothes they had worn during the robbery and also changed their appearance, by haircut and trimmed beard. They went in hiding in different states and maintained minimal contact over phone,” Meerut SSP Ajay Sahani said.

For the local police, the December 17 robbery was a “blind case” as the accused had left no clues. They had decamped with digital video recorder (DVR) of the CCTV camera installed at the premises of the jewellery showroom.

“Police had to trace the suspects through CCTV cameras installed on the route which the robbers took after the crime. They also took inputs from the victims to arrive at the list of suspects,” the police officer said.

“A dedicated team was working round-the-clock to solve the case. Teams were sent to Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Punjab and Rajasthan in search of the suspects who had gone in hiding soon after the incident,” Meerut zone’s additional director general (ADG) Prashant Kumar said.

“Akshay was in debt of over Rs 25 lakh, which he had lost in betting. To recover the amount, he had hatched the robbery with his aides,” SSP Sahani said. Investigation revealed that Akshay worked as an artisan in jewellery manufacturing and has knew about the thriving bullion establishments in the city and security loopholes.

“The gang had been conducting recce for the past 6-7 months before they carried out the robbery on December 17,” the SSP said. Police are probing the role of the gang in at least four robberies, two each in Meerut and Delhi. Their role in other similar cases is also being probed.

Nashik: A member of the Maharashtra scheduled castes and scheduled tribes commission, Justice C L Thool, on Thursday said the police should provide security to men who were allegedly assaulted and abused during a birthday party at a farmhouse in rural Nashik last week.

The victims have been admitted to the Nashik civil hospital.

“I have told police to provide full security to the victims, their families and witnesses so that they don’t turn hostile in any case,” said Thool after meeting the victims, police and the district administration.

Thool said that the victims spoke at length about the way they were beaten up. He has instructed the doctors to provide all medication to them and take the help of social justice department, if required, for buying medicines.

According to police, the victims are disk jockeys and were hired for a birthday party at the farmhouse. During the event, there was an altercation between them and the host. The victims were then allegedly beaten up and remarks passed against them.

The main suspect, who has been arrested along with nine others, is a history-sheeter. All the nine suspects have been booked under various sections of the atrocities act. The main suspect has cases against him in various police stations and had been externed from Nashik city. He was arrested from a hideout in Nandurbar.

“I have heard both the victims carefully. I have gone through the station diary as well. As of now, it appears that everything said by the victims has been noted down correctly. I have asked police to complete all the formalities required in the next three days and take the issue to logical conclusion,” Thool said.

The SC-ST commission member instructed police to take extra measures to ensure that evidence is not tampered with. He also advised the doctors and the family members to limit the number of visitors meeting the victims as it was necessary for their own safety.

Trichy: Nammalvar Motcham was observed in Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam, which marked the conclusion of the 21-day long Vaikunta Ekadasi festival on Thursday. The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department that manages the Srirangam temple said that the festival attracted close to 12 lakh devotees during the festival.

On Thursday morning, at around 5.30 am, senior temple priests initiated the rituals of Nammalvar Motcham. The idol of Nammalvar, one of the 12 supreme devotees of Lord Vishnu, was placed at the feet of Lord Namperumal, the processional deity of Ranganathaswamy temple. HR&CE sources said that the practice was observed to re-enact the act of saint Nammalvar achieving Motcham (transcendent state).

“The last two days of Vaikunta Ekadasi festival attracted a significant number of devotees as they overlapped with the Pongal holidays.

Around two lakh people visited the temple during the opening of Paramapadavasal on January 6,” said P Jayaraman, HR&CE joint-commissioner of the temple. During the 21 days, officials said that 12 lakh people thronged the temple.

The next opening of Paramapada Vaasal is scheduled to be celebrated on December 25. Every year, during the Tamil month Margazhi (December-January), Vaikunta Ekadasi is celebrated in the pattern of Pagal Pathu (daytime celebrations for 10 days) and Raa Pathu (night-time celebrations for 10 days).

On the first day of Raa Paththu, Namperumal was taken in a procession from sanctum sanctorum, exiting the Paramapatha Vaasal also known as Sorga Vaasal (gateway to heaven) to appear for the devotees in thousand pillar mandapam.

TRICHY: The body of a 24-year-old man with his face mutilated was found on a vacant plot near Uzhavar Sandhai in Thennur here on Wednesday. The deceased was identified as P Santhoshkumar from Kooni Bazaar in Palakkarai in the city.

On getting the information, Santhoshkumar’s mother P Muthulakshmi came to the spot and confirmed the identity of the deceased. According to the complaint by his mother, Santhoshkumar and his younger brother Sathish were labourers in the fish market in Puthur. Their father died a few years ago.

Santhoshkumar left home on January 13 but did not return. His mother and brother tried reaching him on his mobile phone but the phone remained switched off.

On Wednesday, she got the information from her relative about his body being found with the face crushed.

Muthulakshmi pointed the needle of suspicion on three of his friends who were also working at the fish market. She said that Arun, Sathish and Durai could have settled scores with him over some trivial issues.

Based on her complaint, Thillai Nagar police registered a case against the three and are on their lookout. The police brought the body to Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital for postmortem.

Sharad Pawar

NAGPUR: Even as new energy minister Nitin Raut has ruled out scrapping of two new 660MW thermal units at Koradi power plant, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar wants new ones in Nashik.

A source in Mahagenco said that there are only three units in Nashik power plant. “Only one is being run at present because the power is costlier than other power stations. There were plans for a 660MW unit but it is stuck due to the objection raised by ministry of defence (MoD) over the height of the chimney,” he added.

Nashik minister Chhagan Bhujbal wants new units there so that locals can get jobs. He requested Mahagenco to start new ones there but did not get much response. He therefore contacted his boss Sharad Pawar.

The source said that Pawar recently held a meeting in this regard with chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) of Mahagenco and other senior officials.

The officials told him about the problem of chimney’s height. They also said that as Nashik plant was far away from coal mines, the cost of its power was higher than those located in Vidarbha. “We told him that Nashik power would not be purchased under merit order dispatch (MOD),” said the source.

Pawar however, was adamant on new units. The officials therefore proposed that the non-operational old units would be renovated and made online. The NCP chief asked the officials to submit a report within days about all the options.

Even though Mahagenco is having difficulties in getting environmental clearance for Koradi units, it is not ready to shift them to Nashik, where locals are ready.

Local environmentalists trashed Mahagenco’s contentions that Nashik power would not be purchased. “Mahagenco will sign a power purchase agreement (PPA) with MSEDCL, its sole consumer, and if there is need for power then Nashik power will be consumed,” said an environmentalist.

The Mahagenco source also said that with solar power costing around Rs3 per unit, Nashik power would be costly too at over Rs4 per unit. However, this logic is true for Koradi units too.

Raut wants new units in Koradi as they will generate 5,000 jobs for locals. He is however, completely ignoring the damage to health of people due to increase in pollution.

Aurangabad: Environmentalists have raised a strong objection to the civic administration’s move to cut around a large number of trees in the Harsul area for setting up a waste processing plant, saying that the facility can be established without harming the trees.

The deputy mayor, however, said that the said trees will be transplanted and the city will not lose them at any cost.

The Harsul tree issue has drawn much attention as experts have already been opposing the proposal to cut trees for the memorials of Balasaheb Thackeray and Gopinath Munde.

The AMC has selected ‘gut’ number 5 and 14 in the Harsul area to set up the 150 tonne per day (TPD) waste management plant.

According to civic activist Ayyub Patel, the proposed waste management facility at Harsul would require cutting of around 150 trees. “The site selected for the plant has 50 mango trees on the 7/12 extract. In fact, the number of trees is more. Around 150 trees of neem, chiku, mango and other varieties will be cut by the AMC,” he said.

The civic body had started dumping garbage at the site in April 2018, turning the area into a mound of mixed waste. Two months later, in July, the AMC buried around 70 trucks of waste under the ground around 200m away from the site. A 16 TPD unit was also raised at the site in 2019 for processing waste. All these activities were undertaken in Harsul, but not without cutting trees.

Asked to comment on the issue current issue, deputy mayor Rajendra Janjal said the trees from the site in Harsul would be carefully transplanted at another location.

However, Kishor Pathak, an expert and also a member of the local tree authority, said, “If they want to raise a waste processing unit, they can do so without harming the trees. No tree can be cut without the tree authority’s permission. Even if permission is sought, we will not approve it,” he added.

Hyderabad: With the dust settling on the nominations, as the last date for withdrawal was January 14, the battle lines are drawn for the forthcoming municipal polls on January 22.

National parties, including BJP and Congress, could field candidates in just 75% of 3,052 wards, including divisions, going to the polls in less than a week. According to State Election Commission data, BJP has fielded 2,313 candidates for 3,052 wards, while Congress candidates are in the fray in 2,616 wards. In other words, BJP did not get candidates for the contest in 739 wards, while Congress has no candidate in 436 wards.

On the other hand, TRS has already bagged 80 wards unanimously.

“Last time, we could find candidates for just 50% of the wards. This time, however, we found nearly 80% candidates. In some areas, our candidates were threatened by TRS leaders and they were abused otherwise we would have returned better numbers” BJP national spokesperson K Subhash said.

BJP district units were backing independents in 120 wards, wherever they did not find suitable candidates or party’s nominees did not file nominations. Sources said BJP had a tough time finding candidates in erstwhile Khammam district, a former Communist citadel, Mahbubabad, and Medak. The sources said the party had difficulty in finding candidates in Muslim-dominated areas too. “We did not have our base in certain areas like Huzurnagar, so we could not find candidates there,” a senior leader admitted.

Even Congress faced difficulties in some areas as more than one candidate was eyeing the same ward. In such cases, the party remained neutral. “There are at least 100 wards across the state where we have more than one candidate in the fray, even though we did not find candidates for all wards. We had more candidates than last time. In many areas, our candidates are being lured or threatened with cases. In such areas, we are supporting independent candidates,” Nayani Rajendar Reddy, a District Pradesh Congress president, told TOI

Congress faced difficulties in finding candidates in surrounding areas of Hyderabad like Rangareddy, Medchal, Sangareddy, Jayashankar-Bhupalapally districts, Warangal Rural and Parakala. Incidentally, BJP observed Parakala bandh on Thursday alleging that TRS was misusing state machinery.

CHANDRAPUR: Minister for relief and rehabilitation and salt pan development Vijay Wadettiwar on Thursday blamed the raging man-animal conflict in forests for the recent death of a tiger in South Brahmapuri range.

The tiger’s carcass, sans the head, paws and tail was recovered last Saturday in South Brahmapuri forest range. The forest department suspects it to be a case of poaching and have arrested eight villagers from Mudjha holding them responsible for chopping off the tiger’s body parts.

Brahmapuri is the assembly constituency of Wadettiwar. Addressing a press conference, he claimed that such incidents can happen due to farmers’ anger. “Those having farms in the fringe forest often suffer losses due to intrusion of wild animals and cattle killing by the predators. Man-animal conflict is at its peak in Brahmapuri,” he said.

Wadettiwar also said that a committee will be formed soon to study high pollution in Chandrapur. “The panel will evaluate the reasons behind the rising pollution and suggest remedies and measures to deal with it. The recommendations will be effectively implemented,” he added.

In September 2019, the standing committee, chaired by BJP’s Jaishree Kulkarni, had rejected the tender proposal submitted by the AMC, citing inefficiency of P H Jadhav— the agency shortlisted based on the lowest bid. The committee asked the administration to carry out the tender process afresh. Subsequently, the Sena members again brought the old tender before the standing committee during a meeting on Tuesday. While Sena members wanted the committee to reconsider the old tender, the BJP pushed for re-tendering.

On Wednesday, BJP city chief Kishanchand Tanwani questioned the Sena’s stand. He asked, “How come the Sena, which had agreed on retendering in the standing committee meeting in September, is now pushing for the agency shortlisted in the old tender?”

On Thursday, Janjal said that the BJP’s persistence for a new tender would disturb the financial management of the solid waste management (SWM) project. “The state government has already approved Rs 148 crore for the SWM project. The BJP members want to issue a combined tender for the waste processing plant and civil construction. However, the work order for civil construction at Harsul has already been issued to a contractor based on the rates of 2017-18. If we go for retendering, it is going to take more time and money as the agencies will quote increased rates,” he said.tnn

Lucknow: While senior BJP leaders will soon arrive in UP to gather support for the amended citizenship law, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has roped in its minority arm, Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), to allay fears on CAA over a platter of Khichdi.

Sources said Sangh also plans to organise public meetings under the aegis of Rashtriya Ekta Mission to convince Muslims, most of whom are staunchly opposed to the amended citizenship law.

Murari Das, national co-convener of MRM, told TOI that the manch would depute its Muslim cadre in cities which witnessed violent protests against the CAA in December. These cities included Lujcknow, Kanpur and parts of west UP. In Lucknow, Khichdi bhoj is scheduled on Friday. MRM will organise a khichdi bhoj and karyakarta sammelan in Allahabad and Kanpur on January 19 and 20, respectively.

Aurangabad: In a major development towards water tax recovery, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has received the data of 1.3 lakh consumers from the private company assigned to manage water supply for two years until September 2016.

A report published by TOI on December 29 highlighted that the municipal corporation is not issuing water bills to its consumers due to the non-availability of data.

Under a contract signed with the civic body, the Aurangabad City Water Utility Company Ltd. (ACWUCL) was managing the water supply of the city for two years. The company issued water bills to consumers and also carried out the recovery of water tax. However, after the AMC terminated the contract with the company in September 2016, no formal handover of the water supply system was given to the civic body.

The ACWUCL also did not share the data of the water consumers with the AMC. Therefore, the civic body was not issuing any water bills to consumers. The TOI report stated that the AMC tax officer had agreed that the municipal corporation does not have their consumer data due to which they could not issue water tax bills. Subsequently, municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey had said that that he will seek data from the previous water supply company in return of clearance of its outstanding dues.

Tax officer Karan Chavan on Thursday said that the AMC has received the data for 1.30 lakh water consumers from the water supply company. “The data includes all the consumers that were being taxed by the compa0ny in 2016. The data was bifurcated into different zones. We have forwarded the data to the respective zones,” Chavan said.

Lucknow: Alarmed over fatal accidents on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway, UP government has commissioned a study of accidents on the 302km e-way.

The transport department has engaged not-for-profit social organisation SaveLIFE Foundation to study the pattern of accidents and find scientific solutions to curb them. The agency would also enable the government to adopt zero-fatality corridors on pilot basis, targeting high-fatality stretches. The aim is to bring down the number of accidents. If successful, the pilot study will be replicated.

“The organisation will help undertake scientific study of the problem and suggest necessary strategy and policy changes to make road journey safer. It will develop an action plan to roll out road safety interventions and also help the department organise training workshops in basic trauma life support, forensic investigation and safe systems,” said transport commissioner Dheeraj Sahu.

The study is significant, considering that the maximum number of lives lost due to road accidents in India are from UP every year.

In 2018, 22,528 people were killed in 44,568 accidents in UP, according to data from the transport ministry.

Founder of SaveLIFE Foundation Piyush Tewari said that his organisation, which has a team of 15 qualified road engineers, would undertake systematic investigation of road crashes.

A separate study of Greater Noida Expressway will also be conducted alongside, said an official.

Chandigarh is a planned city and has good things for us to learn from, said a Shiv Sena corporator

MUMBAI: The BMC ’s civic works committee, which had intended to visit Andaman Islands to study their drainage system, will now head to Chandigarh instead. The Andaman plan was cancelled at the last minute after BJP members in the committee objected to it.

BJP members said Mumbai will learn little from Andaman and added such a tour should be avoided in view of the BMC’s depleting financial collections.

The committee led by Shiv Sena amended its study tour proposal at Thursday’s civic works meeting in favour of Chandigarh. Sena members said BJP had decided against the tour long back following their group leader’s instructions, and no one opposed the proposal.

There are different committees in the BMC, including a works committee that comprises corporators from different political parties proportionate to their party’s strength. They plan national and international study tours for members on public expense, to study existing infrastructure in other cities and countries for implementation in Mumbai. It is alleged in the past, they rarely submitted detailed reports about their visits.

BJP’s Snehal Shah said, “We opposed the tour proposal as there is nothing for us to learn from Andaman’s drainage system. The last study tour was to Shillong but the members did not inform us what they learned there.”

Makrand Narvekar, another BJP corporator, said, “We asked the committee to record our opposition to the visit, following which the tour location was changed. Reports indicate that the BMC’s financial collections are very poor. Then why do we need such a study tour?”

Senior Sena corporator Shraddha Jadhav said civic officials visit various places to learn new things. She said, “Some members were not comfortable with Andaman so I suggested Chandigarh and all agreed to it. Chandigarh is a planned city and has various good things for us to learn for implementation in the city.”

Arundhati Dudwadkar, another Sena corporator, said, “BJP had decided to not join the tour because of instructions from their group leader.”

AURANGABAD: Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu) has asked colleges to carry out an academic audit failing which, the institutes will lose the affiliation.

According to an official release, the colleges have also been told to submit necessary proposals before January 31.

A large section of academic institutions affiliated to Bamu is believed to be running without performing academic audits for a few years. The university has around 410 affiliated colleges with cumulative student strength of over 3 lakh and all these institutions will have to comply with the latest directive.

The move, which has been ordered by vice-chancellor Pramod Yeole has been welcomed by the student community.

“The necessary proposals must be routed through official website of the university before January 31 and should be submitted in-person with supporting documents before February 5. Institutions that have undergone academic audit in the recent past must also carry out the desired audit afresh. The message is loud and clear that no affiliation will be granted to any of the institution from the upcoming academic year if the audit is not performed,” Bamu’s pro-VC Pravin Wakte said.

Stating that the objective of the academic audit would be to oversee continuation of affiliation through a systematic process, the university authorities have appealed to all the colleges to carry out the desired exercise in letter and spirit.

The TOI on December 24, 2019, had reported that Bamu, under the leadership of new VC, has defined the necessary framework for carrying out the academic audit.

The academic audit committee shall consist of a retired VC or pro-VC as its chairman and external as well as internal members. The external members will be charted accountant, engineer or architect and renowned academician of the rank of professor.

The internal member will be three experts of the rank of associated professor from different disciplines. As per norms devised by Bamu, the audit committee will recommend to the academic council of the university the period for which affiliation may be granted to the audited institution and can have a right to recommend freezing of admissions for the first year in case of unsatisfactory performance.

Student activist Tukaram Saraf said, “The Maharashtra Public University Act, 2016, has mandated academic audit for all affiliated institutions.

Representative image

AURANGABAD: Maharashtra cabinet minister and Jalna district guardian minister Rajesh Tope announced on Thursday that the water from Jayakwadi dam will be provided for irrigation on 2.07 lakh hectares during rabi and summer crop seasons.

A meeting of the Canal Advisory Committee was held on Thursday, which was led by Tope. In the meeting, water management of major projects in Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Parbhani, Osmanabad and Latur were discussed.

Tope declared the plan of distributing water from major projects including Jayakwadi, Nimna Dudhna, Nandur Madhmeshwar Canal and Majalgaon dam.

He said Jayakwadi has 100% water storage (2170.935 million cubic metre water storage) and water will be supplied from the dam for all the approved water supply schemes for drinking water and industrial needs until July 31, 2020.

“Two cycles of water supply for rabbi crop and four cycles for summer crop will be provided. As much as 2.07 lakh hectare land will be irrigated from water in the Jayakwadi reservoir, left and right canals,” Tope said.

With 100% storage, Nandur Madhmeshwar canal will also supply water until July 31. The water in the reservoir and the canal of the Nandur Madhmeshwar project will be irrigating 17,600 and 4,700 hectare of land respectively.

However, with poor water storage of 13%, the Nimna Dudhna project will be able to support one cycle only for rabbi crop from its dead storage. “Only drinking water and approved industrial schemes will be provided through the project,” the cabinet minister said.

The Majalgaon project in Beed, with 312 million cubic metre water storage, is filled to its capacity and therefore all the drinking water and industrial needs depend on the project. A total of 46,000 hectare land will be irrigated through the project.

Nimna Terna project in Osmanabad has 35% water storage. Apart from drinking water and industrial needs, the project will suffice agricultural needs by irrigating 2,932 hectare land through three cycles in rabbi season. Tope said that due to a large number of vacant posts in the Command Area Development Authority (Cada) and water resources department, the retired officials and new people will be hired on a contractual basis.

451,['17/01/2020'],Illegal mobile towers: AMC gets Rs 4.14 crore towards property tax,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has received a cheque of Rs 4.14 crore from the high court towards property tax dues for illegal mobile towers across the city on Thursday.

With this, the total recovery of property tax from mobile towers this financial year has reached Rs 8 crore. After taking charge on December 9, municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey had underlined that improving AMC’s financial condition was his top priority.

Subsequently, several measures were taking by the civic body, including intensified tax recovery and mobile tower sealing drives. According to AMC tax officer Karan Chavan, two mobile companies had deposited Rs 4 crore in the high court when dispute related to double taxation was on.

“On Thursday, we received a cheque of Rs 4.14 crore from the court in which Rs 14 lakh is towards the interest of the deposited money,” he said.

AMC legal advisor Aparna Thete said the civic body has previously received Rs 4 crore in different instalments for mobile tower tax through the court. “Altogether, the AMC is expecting a recovery of Rs 30 crore towards property tax from mobile companies. However, that amount is calculated based on double tax. The decision of court is awaited on double taxation,” she said.

The AMC had imposed double taxation on telecom companies for erecting illegal mobile towers in city as per section 267 (a) of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act, 1949. The telecom companies subsequently had approached the Aurangabad Bench of Bombay high court seeking exemption from paying penalty for failure to pay taxes.

Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said that the city has around 600 mobile towers of which only 64 are legal.

“Our lawyer has informed that these illegal mobile towers are not protected under the court directive. Hence, the AMC holds the right to demolish or seal the towers under sections 51 and 52 of Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966,” Ghodele said, adding that the list of illegal towers is with the AMC and action will begin soon.

Udupi: The smell of ghee and melting jaggery is wafting across the streets of the temple town as preparations for the Paryaya feast get under way. Ascending seer Eeshapriya Teertha of Adamaru Mutt is set to roll out the mat for more than 50,000 devotees who will arrive to witness the biennial transition on Saturday.

More than 100 cooks are at work at Bailakere ground from 7am to 5.30pm every day, churning out sweets and savouries for the feast. About 1.2 lakh sajjige vade, and 60,000 pieces each of laddoo and wheat burfi are being readied.

Following in his predecessor’s footsteps, the Adamaru seer has also decided to do away with sugar and maida in Mutt preparations. Jaggery and whole grains will be used instead.

A buffet system has been set up at ‘Annakrishna’ while ‘Annaprajna’ will cater to those who want to squat for a traditional feast. Arecanut plates and steel glasses will replace plastic cutlery.

The first ‘Horakanike’ (feast offering) was from fisherfolk, Bhajana Mandalis and Mattu Gulla Belegarara Sangha. Udupi District Yuva Brahmana Parishad activists have taken the responsibility of the ‘Ananth Ugrana’, the storeroom where Horakanike items are arranged systematically. Forty tonnes of rice, 3 tonnes of jaggery, 1,000 litres of oil, 3 tonnes of Mattu Gulla (green brinjal), 1,000kg of cucumber and 500kg of pumpkin have already been offered.

Trichy: With the entry of Suriyur Kasi, the village temple bull, through the Vadivasal to the jallikattu arena in Periya Suriyur village, Trichy district witnessed its first Jallikattu of the season on Thursday.

District collector S Sivarasu inaugurated the event at 8 30 am, and it went on till 4 pm with the participation of 610 bulls. The event held on Mattu Pongal witnessed as many as 344 bull tamers entering the arena in six batches.

Periya Suriyur jallikattu happens every year on the second day of the Tamil month of Thai. On Thursday owners of untamed bulls and successful bull tamers went home with prizes including bicycle, refrigerator, armchair, bronze lamp, pressure cooker, gold and silver coins.

In a novel initiative, former Trichy MP and AIADMK Trichy urban district secretary P Kumar gave away native breed male calves to the owners of untamed bulls and successful bull tamers. While he distributed three such calves to the winners, he said that the move was to encourage people to rear native breeds. Thiruverumbur DMK MLA Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, who witnessed the event, gave away gold coins to the winners.

Jothilakshmi, 40, from Woraiyur in Trichy who came along with family sustained injuries when a bull coming out of the jallikattu arena accidentally hit her. She sustained injuries on her thigh and hip and was rushed to the government hospital for treatment. Doctors said that her condition is stable.

A total of 29 people suffered injuries during the event, a sizable number of them were injured outside the jallikattu arena after being charged by bulls coming out of the arena.

A sizable number of bulls were waiting event after 3 pm, the scheduled time for the event to get over. This prompted the organisers to extend the event for another hour to allow some more bulls to enter the arena.

The event by and large went peacefully, and police claimed that it could be achieved only due to strict vigil.

By checking entry of unauthorised people and minor violations by bull tamers in the arena police could ensure discipline, said Zia Ul Haq, Trichy district superintendent of police. Trichy zone Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of police V Balakrishnan asked visitors coming on motorcycle to compulsorily wear helmet.

Trichy district police has announced a cash prize of Rs 5,000 each to a bull owner and a bull tamer for the overall performance in all the five jallikattu events in Trichy district. “Almost every policeman will be part of Jallikattu arrangement at the end of this season. Being an integral part of the cultural event, we chose to recognise and reward best practice among bull owners and bull tamers,” said Zia Ul Haq.

TRICHY: Ten people were arrested by the Aravakurichi police for flouting norms on the second day of the rooster duel held in Poolamvalasu village of Karur district on Thursday.

People gathered in large numbers at Poolamvalasu village to witness the duels in which more than 1,000 roosters were brought to the venue. During that time, some of them were found betting on the birds and engaged in gambling. Police personnel present there arrested Balakrishnan, 39, Kalimuthu, 40, Karthikeyan, 33 and Mariappan, 45 for betting on roosters and gambling, Rajendran, 42, Ramesh, 39, Vadivel, 39, and Murugesan, 40, Murthy, 30, Senthil Kumar, 34 for tying knives on the claws of the roosters.

Police have registered cases under four sections against the 10 arrested and seized four knives, eight roosters and Rs 1,150 cash used for betting.

Among the popular venues for rooster duel in Karur, a ban was imposed by the district administration in 2014 following the death of two people after they sustained injuries from the knives tied on the claws of the fighter roosters. Organisers of the event however managed to get permission from the high court last year.

This year, the district administration laid down a 21-point regulation to be strictly followed by the organizers. The roosters were allowed to take part in the event only after undergoing medical examination by a team from the animal husbandry. “Roosters were subjected to doping test to check if they were given alcohol. Only healthy roosters without any injuries could take part in the event,” said a veterinarian.

457,['17/01/2020'],"32 deaths in 4 terms, MLAs call for Vaastu check of MP assembly building","This story is from January 17, 2020

Bhopal: ‘Vaastu dosh’ of the MP Vidhan Sabha is again a talking point after leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava voiced the concern at the opening day of the two-day special session of assembly on Thursday. While paying homage to Joura MLA Banwarilal Sharma, who died on December 21 last year, Bhargava said there could be supernatural element responsible for the high number of deaths among sitting MLAs in Madhya Pradesh.

The MP assembly opened its gates in 1996, and rumours of it being jinxed began swirling in a couple of years. At least 32 sitting MLAs have died since 1998, triggering fears that it has a Vaastu dosh.

“We are a House of only 230 members. Yet, in every term since we shifted to the new assembly, eight to 10 sitting MLAs die. Is it the Vaastu or the constant mental and physical pressures that an MLA has to put-up with?” he wondered in the assembly on Thursday.

The Madhya Pradesh assembly building, designed by famous architect Charles Correa, was constructed between 1983 and 1993. It resembles the Sanchi Stupa, which many MLAs believe is inauspicious. Living beings should not be placed in a structure essentially built for the dead, they argue.

Vaastu of the building has been checked more than once. When the Digvijaya Singh government was in power, former Speaker Shrinivas Tiwari held a special puja to “purify the building”. He also called priests from his constituency in Rewa and held a havan for four days. Ten MLAs died during that term, including minister Likhiram Kavre who was beheaded by Maoists.

“Some believe in Vaastu, many don’t,” the LOP said. “Some even make fun that we are talking of it. But we need to consider that the number of deaths of sitting MLAs is unusually high,” he later told reporters outside the House. “There are two aspects — one, the Vaastu of the building, and second, the work hours and stress of MLAs who have no fixed time to eat or sleep. Sometimes, an MLA works till 2am in the night, listening patiently to every person who approaches him,” Bhargava said.

Former Speaker Sitasharan Sharma, BJP MLA from Hoshangabad, said, “During my tenure as Speaker, there were complaints from MLAs. We got a Vaastu expert from Itarsi, who recommended a small change.” A water tank outside the Speaker’s room was filled with soil and converted into a garden and a wall was broken to install a small gate. Changes were also made after Speaker Ishwardas Rohani, deputy Speaker Harvansh Singh and LOP Jamuna Devi died in the 13th assembly’s tenure.

It is not just BJP that is asking for a Vaastu review or a close look at \mental and physical stress of MLAs. Congress minister for revenue Govind Singh Rajput said, “We believe in Vaastu and since the assembly has been shifted to this building, there have been many accidental deaths. The Vaastu needs to be checked.”

Sitting MLAs death in each term

11th assembly 1998-2003, 10 deaths: Omkar Tiwari, Krishnapal Singh, Dariyav Singh Solanki, Magan Singh Patel, Randheer Singh, Likhiram Kavre, Shiv Pratap Singh, Saiyogeeta Singh Devi Deshmukh, Vesta Patel, Lal Singh Patel

12th assembly 2003-2008, 7 deaths: Kishorilal Verma, Dilip Bhatere, Prakash Sonkar, Amar Singh Kothar, Lavkesh Singh, Lakshman Singh Gaud, Sunil Naik

458,['17/01/2020'],It is all talk and show at the governor’s address,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Chennai: The customary governor’s address to the state legislative assembly at the beginning of new year session has turned out to be an exercise in futility and reduced to a farce. A colonial legacy, it could as well be converted into a chief minister’s address, since it is prepared by the cabinet and not the governor .

It is only the media, political circles, and a section of the intelligentsia, which is aware that the governor is merely reading out the text prepared by the state government , and the views expressed are not his at all.

The public image is of the governor having supported the policies and projects of the state, though the governor and the chief minister belong to different parties, wedded to different ideologies.

All ruling parties, even those like the DMK which in the past were opposed to the very institution of governor, have tended to use the motion of thanks to the governor for his address as an endorsement of its own policies and schemes. The AIADMK MLAs led by the ministers thump the benches whenever the governor reads out portions, hailing the government’s achievements or the party’s leaders like M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa, especially when the governor describes her as Puratchi Thalaivi (revolutionary leader). During the DMK rule, MLAs thumped the desks and rejoiced when the governor referred to M Karunanidhi as ‘Doctor Kalaignar’. The ruling parties derived a sense of vicarious pleasure when they got the governors (from adversarial parties) to hail their leaders.

Tamil Nadu has had a history of governors and chief ministers getting along well, barring the brief tenure of Channa Reddy, who accorded sanction to prosecute the then CM J Jayalalithaa in a corruption case. She even accused him of misbehaviour.

In fact, other governors had such a good relationship with their CMs, that there were charges of gifts being exchanged. Those that shared a bonhomie included, S L Khurana, who went out of his way to carry out the Centre’s move to bring back MGR as CM though he underwent a major surgery in the US. But the good times lasted only till it made sense to the Centre’s political calculation. For instance, Fathima Beevi was allowed by the NDA-government at the Centre to invite Jayalalithaa to form the government after the 2001 elections (though she was disqualified as an MLA). Fathima was later removed, apparently under pressure from the BJP’s Delhi ally, the DMK. K K Shah, too, was on good terms with the then chief minister, M Karunanidhi, even during the Emergency. He had praised the Karunanidhi government one day, but the next day was asked to give a report seeking dismissal of the DMK government. He did so to oblige his bosses at the Centre.

Some governors, like Surjit Singh Barnala, had more problems with the ruling parties at the Centre than in the state. When the Chandra Shekhar government at the Centre directed him to send a report recommending dismissal of the DMK government in 1991 for supporting the LTTE, Barnala refused to comply. He chose to resign rather than bow to Delhi’s orders.

The stand of the DMK in the 1950s and the 1960s was in favour of abolition of the posts of governors. ""Where is the need for goats to have beards and for states to have governors"" was the refrain. There is even less need now for governors to make addresses to the legislature when the text is prepared by the state cabinet. It makes even less sense now when the presentation of the budget has been advanced in many states to early February, when the ruling party can spell out its policies and schemes.

The voting on the motion of thanks to the governor for his address to the assembly is a mere formality almost throughout the country. Governors can seek changes of some words or a phrase, but it is up to the ministers to make them. In the long run, it would be less hypocritical to change the format from governor’s address to chief minister’s address.

Trichy: More than 1 ,500 people took part in Gnanavel Murugan Rath Yatra near Puthanatham on the outskirts of Trichy on Thursday. During the procession, members of Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), one of the organizers of the festival, appealed to the people not to spread false propaganda against the citizenship amendment Act (CAA).

The organizers including the residents of 18 villages and VHP members pulled a chariot carrying the deity of Murugan through the streets of the villages from Paraipatti to North Idaiyattupatti.

The annual festival commenced with the procession of around 1,500 people including around 200 women at Paraipatti village and passed through Malaikattupatti and Karuncholaipatti before reaching Puthanatham area.

A special pooja was performed for the deity on the ratha in front of Kaliamman temple in South Street in Puthanatham before resuming the procession towards Gnanavel hill.

Considering the religious sensitiveness in the area, Trichy rural police headed by superintendent of police Zia Ul Haq camped in the area to ensure the peaceful conduct of the festival.

The police said that they deployed 650 police personnel along the four kilometre stretch of the procession route.

The Puthanatham police team led by inspector Shanmugasundaram deployed drones to monitor the procession to avert any untoward incidents. As a part of the festival, some of the leaders of the VHP also addressed the gathering and registered their concern over the propaganda against CAA.

460,['17/01/2020'],MDL lists 300 items it hopes to buy from UP,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Lucknow: A chemical manufacturer in Kanpur who has developed a water repellent, a man in Shahjahanpur who has created fire- resistant marine plywood, a valve supplier in Kanpur and startups from IIT Kanpur are some of the reasons why Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd (MDL), a GOI undertaking, has come to UP to scout for possible suppliers and manufacturers.

In a meeting with more than 50 interested industrialists on Thursday ahead of the Defence Expo, MDL put forward a list of 300 items which it hopes it can source from UP. It has been mandated to procure goods worth at least Rs 10,000 crore from MSMEs in the next 8-10 years, which is a massive opportunity for companies in UP, said Rear Admiral AK Saxena, director of ship building at MDL.

The company’s foray into UP has been facilitated by Indian Industries Association, the umbrella body of MSMEs in the state.

MDL has said that if MSMEs cannot export bulk orders of products and equipment to far off places like Mumbai, MDL can help with that too. It is also ready to handhold startups and even assist with funding if the product is of superior quality. General secretary of IIA Manmohan Agarwal said after Defence Expo, IIA would arrange for a visit of industrialists to MDL in Mumbai.

Vendors sell used books outside the book fair

CHENNAI: If you are visiting the book fair at YMCA in Nandanam , then don’t miss this ‘alternate’ fair. The pavement leading to the YMCA premises on Anna Salai is dotted with vendors selling old books .

Around 10 stalls have put on sale 10,000 books of which most are English titles with prices ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 150. Most of the vendors ply their trade on pavements near LIC and on Bharathi Salai in Triplicane, and move to venues near book fairs every year.

A M Hyder, a stall owner, said rare books sold at reasonable rates were their USP. “We have books on furniture, antiques and numismatics that may not be available at the book fair. Some books on writings of Mahatma Gandhi are also rare,” he said.

Vendors source used books from different parts of the city. Books on academics, English grammar and novels are in high demand. Titles of international authors are available in plenty.

Villivakkam-based C N Vathilingam, a vendor for more than 50 years, said he had always set up a stall near the fair. “Some of my friends give away books stocked in their homes or we buy them cheap. We sell them,” he said. Vaithilingam once owned a book shop at Moore Market.

Vendors said people looked for specific titles and previous editions of titles no more available. While some vendors said there was brisk sale this year, a few reported poor business. S Nandhakumar, who is selling hard copies of articles published on an online portal, said his objective was to promote the portal. “But I will hardly earn Rs 300 during the book fair,” he said.

The stalls though have attracted book lovers and onlookers. S Sathya, who works for a private firm and bought a book on Gandhi, said, “I regularly purchase a couple of books from these stalls when I visit the book fair.”

The artificial limb was designed and made by Dr Sadanand Thote and Ameya Kathale of Saket Orthopaedic Applianc... Read More

NAGPUR: The world’s first attempt to fit a prosthetic limb to Sahebrao, a male tiger, ended in a disappointment after the big cat rejected it by thumping and shaking it loose. Wildlife veterinarians and orthopaedicians, who initiated the process to fit an artificial limb to Sahebrao on Saturday morning, immediately removed the prosthetic even before it could stand and attempt to walk.

Ever since losing its left paw in a trap in 2012, Sahebrao has been housed in the Gorewada Rescue Centre in city, where the operation to give the nine-year-old a chance to walk comfortably was conducted.

“After the anaesthesia wore off, Sahebrao seemed anxious on the object screwed to his paw. Feeling uncomfortable, it started banging its foot continuously. We suspect it contracted its muscles resulting in the prosthetic coming off easily even though it was fitted well with screws,” said city orthopaedician Dr Sushrut Babhulkar and wildlife surgeon Dr Shirish Upadhye.

Maintaining that it was a difficult operation, Dr Peter Giannoudis said the doctors “have learnt from the experiment and we will have to restore the missing links”. A professor of orthopaedics in University of Leeds, he had visited Gorewada twice to take a look at Sahebrao.

Dr Babhulkar said the failure had nothing to do with the measurement or design of the prosthetic. “We never imagined that the tiger would contract its muscles. The cat species can shrink their size by contracting skeleton muscles,” he added.

The artificial limb was designed and made by Dr Sadanand Thote and Ameya Kathale of Saket Orthopaedic Appliances & Artificial Limb Centre, in city. Kathale said, “This was the first such prosthetic for a tiger. Earlier, I have done it successfully for cats and dogs. It is easier to do it for domestic animals but difficult in carnivores,” he added.

Sahebrao’s limb weighed 1.8kg. “After a lot of research it was brought down to that weight so that the tiger could sustain its weight. Anything lighter in weight would have compromised on quality,” said Kathale.

Next, Dr Babhulkar said they plan to do ‘osseointegration’ where a new bone is laid down directly on the implant surface and the implant exhibits mechanical stability. “However, we will rework on the plan at a later stage after getting in touch with experts worldwide. For now, we are just dumbfounded over the unsuccessful attempt,” he added.

Dr Babhulkar came to know about Sahebrao’s plight through forest staff who visited him for treatment. The orthopaedician then adopted him on February 2018 and promised to get an artificial limb after expert advice.

The experts first suggested removing neuroma in the tiger’s limb. As a first step, Sahebrao underwent clinical and radiological tests in August 2018. During the same time, it was measured for the prosthetic.

In October last year, the tiger was operated upon by Dr Upadhye, Dr Gautam Bhojne, Dr Vinod Dhoot and others for neuroma and arthritis. It is only after relieving it from pain that the operation to fit the artificial limb was attempted.

“The Maharashtra Animal and Fishery Science University (Mafsu) and Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra have signed an MoU to promote research. We are not averse to further modifications and efforts to give an artificial limb to Sahebrao,” said FDCM MD Dr N Rambabu & Dr Ashish Paturkar, vice-chancellor of MAFSU.

Aurangabad: The proposed transport hub at Karodi on the outskirts of Aurangabad city is still a distant dream, drawing sharp reactions from stakeholders.

The project was first mooted around a decade ago when the ‘Vision 2020’ document for Aurangabad city was prepared. The initiative of the then guardian minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, the document had proposed solutions to some of the pressing issues faced by the city on different fronts.

The proposed transport hub at Karodi was expected to minimize traffic of heavy vehicles in the city besides serving as a one-stop solution for different needs of transporters.

Civic activist Sayyed Mushtaq Sayyed Isaak said that it was ironic that the project which was envisaged in the ‘Vision 2020’ document around a decade ago is still on paper.

“States such as Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have set up transport hubs which offer multiple benefits. Taking a cue from some of these projects, we had proposed a similar facility in Aurangabad. The project had found a place in the ‘Vision 2020’ document also, but no progress could has been made,” he said.

According to stakeholders, the revenue department authorities had also proposed land of around 65-acre for the project at Karodi.

“Despite repeated follow-ups with the government authorities and public representatives, the transport hub has witnessed no progress. The facility could have been vital for the growing city like Aurangabad, which witnesses huge movement of the commercial vehicles,” Sayyed said.

Aurangabad district collector Uday Chaudhari could not be reached for his comments.

Meanwhile, no progress has been witnessed either on the demand for shifting the freight loading and unloading point at Aurangabad railway station. The place is located in the immediate vicinity of the station and witnesses huge traffic of heavy vehicles.

NAGPUR: Former president of Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA) Pravin Tapadia has come under the income tax department’s scanner. Tax sleuths have conducted a raid on one of the companies in which he is a director. The department on Thursday conducted search and survey operations on Tapadia Polyesters Private Limited, run by Tapadia, as well M/s Mira Zarda, a betel-nut and tobacco trading firm located in Itwari area. The firm is headed by local businessman Ajay Kamnani.

It is learnt that the taxmen had been keeping tabs on the affairs in Tapadia Polyesters on a regular basis after which finally a raid was planned. The action covers seven premises. A search or raid as it is known in common parlance was conducted in four out of these. A survey was conducted in three. In a survey no cash or other assets can be seized from the premises, but it can be done so if it’s a search operation.

Sources said the company was apparently suppressing income by not recording part of it’s sales and purchases. There are chances that proceeds of such transactions may have been parked in real estate.

In Mira Zarda, sleuths have found that the firm was dealing in banned tobacco products like gutkha and certain low grade cigarettes, which too are banned. The entire deals in the banned items took place in cash, totally evading the tax. Here a search has been conducted in five premises and a survey in four. So far no seizure of cash or other items has been made in both cases, said sources.

Earlier, the income tax department’s directorate of investigation here had detected an alleged refund scam in Nashik. Jurisdiction of the directorate at Nagpur extends up to Nashik. It was found that a number of salaried taxpayers had secured refunds through an agent on the basis of fake documents. So far the department has recovered Rs16 crore such refunds granted to them, said sources.

LUCKNOW: At least 35,000 people living along the 10.9km stretch between Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport and Vrindavan Colony on Kanpur Road will be deprived of meat and fish from retailers and local markets from January 20 to February 9.

As part of the security arrangements for the 11th Defence Expo slated to take place from February 5-8, the district administration has ordered temporary closure of all meat shops in the area for the period. Even roadside vendors selling eggs or meat items and food vans will be removed from the route for at least 20 days .

“The area has been declared a low-fly zone and the protocol involves closure of all meat shops in a 7km radius of the airport to make it a meat-free zone,” said nodal officer for the expo at Lucknow Municipal Corporation Arvind Rao. Officials said that fighter planes participating in the show will take off from and land at CCS Airport. They will fly low until they reach an open ground in Vrindavan Colony, above which the air show will be performed.

“Meat shops often dispose leftovers in the open which attract carnivores including birds. Closing meat shops is essential to deter birds from the area to avoid accidents with planes,” explained Rao.

LMC has also constituted 10 teams to conduct drives for closure of meat shops from January 20.

Thiruvananthapuram: General administration department has sought the intervention of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to cancel the leave of more than 50 secretariat employees who availed it to prepare for the first Kerala Administrative Service ( KAS ) examination to be held on February 22.

A note by principal secretary (GAD) K R Jyothilal said that several employees going on leave to prepare for the examination has affected the functioning of the secretariat, especially when the budget session of the assembly is all set to begin from January 31. The note also said that if those employees who are on leave are appearing for the examination, they should be disqualified.

The note also said that ignoring the duties while on service and preparing for another examination shows their lack of social commitment. “The trend of bettering their own career by ignoring the services to be offered to the public should be discouraged,” the note said. More than 50 employees have availed various types of leave including earned leave and leave without pay, citing multiple reasons. Secretariat sources said that though the leave does not mention anything about the examination, many of them have availed the leave for preparation.

More than four lakh applicants are appearing for the KAS preliminary examination, including several employees from the secretariat. KAS has reservation for those in the government service as well, in addition to general category. Meanwhile, the note by the general administration department secretary has not gone well with the employees’ organizations. “The matters mentioned in the note itself is unwarranted. In KAS, two streams are reserved for government employees. So, how can they be disqualified if they appear for the examination conducted by the public service commission, just because they availed leave? Also, it cannot be said that all those who have availed leave have availed it for exam preparation. The leaves for which they are eligible have been sanctioned by their superior authorities,” general secretary of pro-left Kerala secretariat employees’ association K N Ashok Kumar said.

It is learnt that the chief minister’s office have declined the demand.

469,['17/01/2020'],Non-functional escalators frustrate passengers at railway station,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Aurangabad: Several passengers have complained that the escalators installed at the Aurangabad railway station remain non-operational at most times, especially during the arrival of key trains, posing huge difficulties.

Elderly passengers, expected mothers as well as those travelling with children have been at the receiving end of the lapse.

Narrating his experience, former corporator Mohsin Ahmed said that the escalators at the railway station were not working when he arrived by Nandigram Express on Wednesday morning.

“It was hardship for senior citizens to reach either at the desired platform or exit gate of the station using the foot overbridges (FOB). Moreover, non-functional escalators led to rush at the foot overbridges. It can lead to stampede like situation during rush hours,” he said.

Echoing similar experience, Sanjay Gaikwad, a private professional, said that the passengers carrying heavy luggage often face difficulties due to non-operational escalators.

“I had to carry my huge baggage and handle my children at the same time while making way out of crowded foot overbridge. It was shocking to see such poor management at the railway station,” Gaikwad said.

Aurangabad railway station is equipped with escalators at platforms 2 and 3. The station witnesses footfall of nearly 15,000 passengers per day, including large number of foreign tourists.

Railway activist Omprakash Varma said that the “defunct” escalators not only cause inconvenience to passengers but also leaves a bad impression about the region in the minds of tourists.

“The historic city of Aurangabad and world heritage sites of Ajanta-Ellora are visited by a large number of foreign tourists. The defunct escalators definitely leaves a bad impression in the minds of foreign nationals,” he said.

When contacted, Aurangabad railway station manager L K Jakde said the private contractor assigned with the responsibility of manning the escalators has been reprimanded. “The contractor is based at Nanded and we have informed the divisional authorities about the lapse on his part. We have also proposed a fine to the contractor upon our part,” he said.

COIMBATORE/MADURAI: A file pertaining to sanction granted by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) for setting up a unit of the National Investigation Agency in Chennai is pending with the ministry of finance. Once the finance ministry gives its nod, the unit of the NIA, the primary agency to combat terror, will be set up in Chennai and an officer in the rank of Superintendent of Police will head the unit.

The NIA is also expected to take over the case relating to the killing of special sub-Inspector of police Y Wilson, who was shot dead by two IS suspects at Kaliyakkavilai in Kanyakumari district on January 8. “The district police registered a case under IPC section 302 (for murder ) and the Arms Act. If the case is also registered under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), then can we take it over for further investigation. We are, however, closely monitoring the case,” said the source.

“The MHA had given its nod to set up the NIA unit in Chennai last month. An SP and more than 20 officials will be appointed as part of the Chennai team. An office building for the NIA will be established in the city. The file is pending before the Ministry of Finance for approval,” said an NIA source. Currently, NIA officials from Kochi are handling the cases reported from TN.

Meanwhile, the two terror suspects Abdul Shameem and Taufeeq, who were picked up at the Udupi Railway Station in Karnataka on Tuesday for their suspected role in Wilson’s murder, were produced before a court in Kanyakumari district late Thursday evening and remanded in judicial custody. They have been lodged at the Palayamkottai Central Prison.

Kanyakumari SP N Sreenath told reporters, “The two accused were upset over the arrest of their accomplices and killed Wilson in an act of revenge and to teach the police and administration a lesson.” They killed the officer at Kaliyakkavilai as they were familiar with the place, he said.

Police say the two men had also confessed to having planned coordinated attacks using suicide bombers on Republic Day on January 26.

The SP added that the duo would be taken into police custody soon as they needed to be questioned about their extremist links. “We had very limited time, just 24 hours, to produce them before the court (from the time of arrest). So, we could not question them much,” he said, adding that the gun used for the murder was yet to be recovered.

Medical examination of the two men was conducted by a team of doctors in the Thuckalay police station before they were taken to the Kuzhithurai court. Sreenath said security had been stepped up at all the major as well as minor border check posts connecting Kanyakumari with Kerala. He said the small check posts, like the one where Wilson held post, were primarily established to check movement of medical and poultry wastes from Kerala to Tamil Nadu. “We have now posted armed men and officers and asked them to be on high alert round-the-clock,” he added.

This is the first time TTDC will be operating buses to seven destinations within the city, most of them tourist attractions. Those intersted in the service will have to pay Rs 10 per head.

The bus will follow a circular route with fixed stops (eight stops) and allow passengers unlimited travel for a day with the freedom to disembark at any stop and re-board bus to continue their journey till 6pm.

“Earlier it was decided to operate one bus with seating capacity of 36. As we we have been receiving more inquiries, we have decided to add one more bus with a seating capacity of 18,” said TTDC regional manager G Sabesan.

“There are two advantages, one is people can travel for a cheap rate and there is no bus service within the city connecting all the 7 destinations,” he said.

On being asked if more number of passengers want to avail the service, he said they will consider adding more buses based on the response.

TTDC had introduced ‘hop-on hop-off’ tour for the first time in Chennai on pilot basis and had to operate five buses till Mahabalipuram after receiving overwhelming response, said a TTDC official.

HYDERABAD: While toll plazas across the state were supposed to migrate to FASTag lanes with only two lanes on either side accepting cash, some plazas have been exempted. Two plazas – at Pantagi on NH 65 and Raikal on NH 44 — will be exempted.

“At these plazas, cash will be accepted on 25% of the lanes for next 30 days,” said NHAI regional officer, A Krishna Prasad. This means three to four lanes will accept cash.

The reason for this was heavy traffic pile and high number of cash transactions. “Commuters are being given more time to migrate to the new system,” Prasad said.

Meanwhile, the regional officer informed that commuters will not be given discount on roundtrips on cash payments. “No return journey discount shall be provided to toll payments paid in cash or any other modes with effect from January 15,” an NHAI circular read.

Minister PC Sharma with Jyotiraditya Scindia in Bhopal on Thursday

Bhopal: State minister for transport Govind Singh Rajput, who will host a dinner for members of the cabinet and all MLAs supporting Congress, during the visit of his political mentor Jyotiraditya Scindia on Friday, has said that the dinner is being held to mark the New Year and has nothing to do with ‘dinner diplomacy’, as it is being stated in a section of the state media.

Talking to reporters at the state assembly building on Thursday, Rajput said that they are happy that Jyotiraditya Scindia will participate in the dinner, where all ministers, CM and MLAs supporting the government will be present. “There is no politics involved in the dinner”, he said.

During his visit, Scindia will visit Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) headquarters and attend dinner at Rajput’s official bungalow, besides attending to some personal engagements. He had similar itinerary when he visited the city on July 10-11 last year. Then, health minister Tulsi Silawat had hosted the dinner in which chief minister, ministers and MLAs supporting the government, including two SP MLAs and a BSP MLA took part. During that time, some ministers from Scindia camp had openly complained of being “neglected”. The dinner hosted by a minister from Scindia faction in such a situation was touted as Scindia’s “dinner diplomacy” by a section of media.

Silawat had said then that the dinner was to show unity in Congress and dispel the notion propagated by BJP that this government won’t survive. The political situation remains more or less the same, except for the fact that Kamal Nath government seems far more stable and confident now, but issues like PCC chief and Scindia’s nomination to the Upper House in the election slated in April are still on top of the agenda for the state party leadership.

The main road, which is a two minute ride from National Highway-44, is surrounded by commercial properties on either sides.The stretch is not an anomaly but a regular feature in Kompally, one of the fastest growing municipalities that houses several commercial and residential buildingsThe reason behind the poor condition of the roads has been attributed to work being taken up by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB).The water board had dug the road to lay a 35-kilometre-long pipeline network under Telangana government’s ‘Mission Bhagiratha’ scheme, to provide potable water to every household.Another resident, S Jagannatha Reddy, said, “It is the responsibility of authorities to restore the roads . Several pleas have been sent to the engineering wing, but they have been ignored.”When TOI contacted Subramanyam, deputy general manager, HMWS&SB project division-V said, “The water board will not take up road restoration works at Kompally municipality as it is comes under GHMC.

Representative image

MADURAI: With half-yearly exams done and dusted, board exams loom ahead for students of classes V and VIII for the first time. As uncertainty still surrounds the exams, right from the syllabus to question paper pattern, many schools in the city and parents are pressurising students to study harder.

During the middle of this academic year, the school education department had announced public exams for students of Class V and VIII from this year. Later, it said that students writing for the first three years would not be failed. “Even if students don’t fail, making it a public exam creates pressure for students because schools tend to focus on results. If the students’ performance is not good enough, then the schools’ reputation will be affected. If the top score of a school is low, it can greatly affect admissions for the new year. So, there is pressure to make students work harder at even their young age,” said a government school teacher who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Several government school teachers said that so far no official instruction has been given to conduct special classes after school hours. However, many of them are voluntarily conducting them particularly for late bloomers in a bid to get them to perform better in exams. Many private schools are also holding special classes to help students score better. The classes are mainly in response to the fact that there is still no clarity on the question paper pattern or blueprint so students as a precaution need to cover all portion from all three terms.

Sruthi A, a class VIII student who studies in a private school, said that even if students try to take it easy, parents and teachers are making them feel the pressure. “My parents told me that it is similar to the usual annual exam but that the test papers will be corrected by teachers of another school. That eases my fears but it was pressure enough to be expected to be class topper. Now, teachers and parents expect us to become toppers at state level,” she said.

On the other hand, some feel the move to hold board exams for students at a young age can benefit students, especially from government schools where teachers may not be under pressure to teach lower classes well. “Many government school students are unaware of basic concepts and can barely read or write in class X. These exams can ensure that the quality of teaching in government schools goes up,” said Pandiselvi N, a parent.

479,['17/01/2020'],Budget to fix many eco issues: Thakur,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Kolkata: The Centre is keeping its fingers crossed for revival of India’s economy by shifting its focus from ‘Look East’ to ‘Act East’ policy.

The Union Budget 2020-21 slated to be presented on February 1 is likely to resolve several issues being faced by traders in the country and give thrust on agriculture, job creation and boosting investment on infrastructure development, said Anurag Singh Thakur , Union minister of state, finance and corporate affairs.

Thakur met the representatives of various merchants and traders’ associations at a special session in the city on Thursday and took down their suggestions to resuscitate the economy. “This time, I am in the city to listen to the problems being faced by the traders and know about their expectations in the budget,” said Thakur.

However, the minister of the state sounded confident that the present financial capacity of the country would take a leap in the next five years when “Prime Minister’s targeted 5 trillion economy” can be achieved. “Till now, the Central government has achieved $1 trillion of the target,” he added.

Divestment in share markets, generation of employment, tweak in the policy of environmental clearance for industrial sectors, abolition of GST from real estate sector, boost for housing sector, governmental support to create an appropriate roadmap for the NRIs who are keen to open startups in the country were among the suggestions given to the minister by the representatives of Merchants’ Chamber of Commerce, Bharat Chamber of Commerce, Calcutta Chamber of Commerce, Direct Taxes Professionals’ Association and Association of Corporate Advisors and Executives.

Vivek Gupta, president of MCCI told the minister, “The landmark legislation on insolvency and bankruptcy may step up the industrial sector of the country but its implementation is still very slow.” Narendra Kumar Goyal, president of DTPA urged through Thakur that the Centre take a call on the settlement of the cases pending with National Company Law Tribunal. Total 19,771 cases have been pending with the NCLT benches and 10,860 of these cases come under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016.

“The central bank’s five interest rate cuts last year and billions of dollars of liquidity pumped into financial markets have done little to spur lending. The NPA norms need to be aligned to global norms so that the banks will no longer remain saddled with stressed asset ratios,” said Gupta.

Ramesh Kumar Saraogi, president of BCC, suggested the minister that the Centre make the power sector competitive through PPP model. He also rued that banks only favour big borrowers and are indifferent to MSME units that are “engine of economic growth in the country and have high employment potential.”

The minister said, “I shall take up these issues with the finance ministry and if needed, the government will change policies and amend laws for the country’s economic growth.”

480,['17/01/2020'],Nanded no more needs kerosene,"This story is from January 17, 2020

Aurangabad: The ‘Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana’ (PMUY) launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has highly benefited Nanded, which has achieved the distinction of becoming a ‘kerosene-free’ district in the Marathwada region

With 16 talukas, Nanded is the largest district in the region which has opted for no demand for kerosene through the public distribution system (PDS).

District supply officer, Nanded, Latif Pathan said on Thursday that off late, there has been a rapid decline in the demand for kerosene through PDS in the district.

“As the number of PMUY beneficiaries started swelling, there were lesser takers of kerosene. Of the 16 talukas in Nanded district, 15 of them had registered zero demand for kerosene through PDS by June last year. There was a certain demand for kerosene only in Umari taluka. Now, even that taluka does not require kerosene,” said Pathan.

Before the launch of the central scheme, Nanded district had a requirement of around 14.68 lakh litre of kerosene through PDS. The district administration has over 5.7 lakh families benefiting from PDS, including over 2.65 lakh target beneficiaries of PMUY. As per official record, LPG connections were given to 1,82,868 PMUY beneficiary families in the first phase and another 25,528 families in the next phase.

“Around 15,821 families are yet to avail the central scheme. This implies that these families are still stuck to the traditional ways of cooking using firewood. Attempts are on to reach out to the remaining beneficiaries,” said Pathan.

Launched on May 1, 2016, PMUY aims to provide Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) connections to households falling below poverty line (BPL) in the country. The scheme, which aims at replacing unclean cooking fuels, mostly used in rural India, achieved the target of giving 8 crore LPG connections seven months ahead of its stipulated deadline set in September last year.

Incidentally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be handing over the LPG connection to the 8th crore beneficiary at an event, which will be organised in Sendra, Aurangabad on September 7.

District collector Arun Dongre said Nanded might be among the first few districts in the country to have registered zero demand for kerosene through PDS. “The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana has a broad objective of bringing a positive change in the lives of women, especially those from rural areas. The zero demand for kerosene implies successful implementation of the central scheme in the district,” he said.

Police at the accident site in Mohanlalganj

LUCKNOW: The driver of a speeding hatchback was on Thursday booked for drunk driving after he rammed his car into a sedan carrying a family of six.

Anshu Verma, the accused, had undergone a breathalyser test in Mohanlalganj police station after the incident on Wednesday around 4pm in Kankaha, Mohanlalganj. He had hit the sedan carrying the family of Allahabad resident Sahid Umar (38). He and his wife Afroz (34), brother-in-law Abdul and three children aged 11, nine and five were injured in the accident.

The impact was such that both cars had overturned multiple times and landed in the undergrowths along the road. Locals had rescued the occupants and sent them for treatment to a community health centre in Mohanlalganj. Anshu Verma, also injured, was detained by police and sent for treatment and medical examination.

Mohanlalganj SHO Gaudeen Shukla said, “We found the accused heavily drunk and confirmed it with a breathalyzer test. The complainant had lodged an FIR of drunk driving.”

Umar’s family was returning from Dubagga and headed to Allahabad.

“After the accident, I lost conscious for a few minutes. When I regained consciousness, I saw my wife bleeding from the head. With the help of locals, I rescued her and my kids and rushed to a hospital. They are out of danger now but still very traumatised,” said Umar.

“There were four people in the hatchback that hit us. Two escaped while the driver and another man were detained. They were heavily drunk and I saw empty liquor bottles inside their hatchback,” Umar further added.

“We were fortunate that no one died. However, men like Anshu must not be allowed to drive vehicles, as they are a threat to people travelling on road,” he said.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: The three-kilometre stretch on Outer Ring Road between Burari Chowk and Bhalswa Chowk is arguably the ‘deadliest’ in the city claiming several lives every year. This “killer stretch” was chosen by Delhi government for a proposed “zero fatality corridor” last year. The government, in collaboration with SaveLIFE Foundation , was to scientifically assess the cause of accidents.

The average national figure of fatalities per kilometre is 0.5 annually, while the average for this particular stretch is 11 deaths per km per year. The objective behind adopting the stretch was to turn it from the “deadliest” to the “safest”, and replicate its success on other similar traffic ‘black spots’ in Delhi.

On Thursday, SaveLIFE Foundation, transport department and Delhi Traffic Police initiated “tactical urbanism” trials to mark the 31st National Road Safety Week. “The trials are temporary, quick and relatively low-cost interventions,” a statement from the foundation said.

“The objective of these trials is to insert safety elements for all road users. Since 2016, Bhalswa Chowk has featured among the top black spots in Delhi,” said Piyush Tewari, CEO, SaveLIFE Foundation, adding that in the past three years, at least 25 people have on this stretch.

As part of the trial, temporary urban design interventions will be tested to improve the safety for pedestrians, cyclists and other users. The trials started on Thursday at Bhalswa Chowk to test road space redistribution, road geometries and traffic channelisation among other things, the foundation said.

The old and the new versions of the Kala Samhara and the Nataraja at the Alandurayar temple in Keezhpazhvur in... Read More

CHENNAI: The 9th century Alandurayar temple in Keezhpazhvur in Ariyalur was once known for its rare and ancient sculptures. A couple of weeks ago when a team headed by heritage activists S Vijay Kumar and Aravind Venkatraman visited the Chola temple an administrative staff of the temple asked them not to take photographs. This raised doubts and the team after a detailed investigation found that many of the ruined sculptures have been replaced by substandard ones, supposed to have been made by local artisans.

What happened to the old sculptures? No staff at the temple, which is maintained by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department, could answer to it. When Aravind documented the Alandurayar temple in 2012, the situation was different. The staff were cooperative, and they took him around the temple to try photos of the temple and its sculptures in various angles.

""I was shocked when they told me not to take photographs. But it helped in a way. We wanted to know why they stopped us. We found three ancient sculptures, including the one of Brahma, were replaced with substandard ones in the name of renovation,"" said Aravind. Worse, the staff were clueless about what happened to the old sculptures.

The Ariyalur-Perambalur belt has some great Chola temples and sadly they have been the target of the Sanjeevi Asokan-Subhash Kapoor gang, according to Vijay Kumar, author of ‘The Idol Thief: The True story of the looting of India’s temples’.

""Due to the publicity around this gang we expected greater awareness and better upkeep, security and maintenance of the temple sites. Sadly, that’s not happening,"" he said.

""There is a blanket ban by the court on such renovations yet it continues. Neither the ASI nor the HR&CE has come up with a clear conservation manual. But renovation without vision like this goes against the very tenets of conservation,"" said Vijay Kumar.

There are advanced techniques available today when it comes to restoration of ancient sculptures.

""These ruined sculptures needed special treatment. There are advanced methods and experts are available to do that job. I don’t know why the temple authority removed the ancient ones without following the basic procedures,"" said Aravind.

The temple is significant as it underwent renovations quite a few times. The ancient brick structure of the temple, historians believe, was renovated with stones during the time of Parantaka Chola I (907-955). The team even found an early Chola sculpture of goddess Jesta discarded outside the temple compound.

""There was no response to our questions on the whereabouts of the rest of the sculptures,"" said Vijay Kumar.

Administration does not want to work: High court

CHANDIGARH: After 11 years and 120 hearings by 30 different benches, the Punjab and Haryana high court has reserved its judgment on the conservation of the Sukhna Lake catchment area. But the UT must explain why it waited so long to ask the Centre for help.Passing the interim order on Thursday, the high court divison bench of Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice H S Sidhu not only rapped the UT administration for its “lethargic attitude” that has delayed the sanctioning of Rs 73.51 crore but also gave it two weeks to reopen talks with the environment ministry for this de-siltation and catchment area treatment project.The bench told the ministry to look into matter and consider sanctioning the money.The bench also opined that the Chandigarh authorities must consider the method of dredging and take it to ground, where de-silting of the lake is an urgent requirement. It told the officials to divide the lake into blocks for the preservation effort of dredging.During the resumed hearing, the high court asked the UT administration why it had never tried dredging of the lakebed, to which the UT senior standing counsel replied that experts from the National Institute of Hydrology had stated in report that its was unviable.The court said if the method was good for Pong dam, river Ganga, and the lakes of Nainital, why was it unviable for the Sukhna. The bench observed: “Experts could have their views but we have also seen expert views that defy logic.”The delayed Rs 73.51 crore was for de-silting and deepening the lake. Taking a strong note of the delay, the court observed that: “The Chandigarh administration does not want to work. If the Centre was ready to give the money, why you (the administration) never showed interest? If the UT can’t do this work on its own, it should hand over the job to some other agency. Why is the UT not taking money from the central government when the latter is willing?The high court also observed that its various order had failed to prompt the administration to bring about any tangible change to the state of the Sukhna catchment. It stressed that if the Sukhna was to be conserved and preserved, the problem of desilting must be solved. The Chandigarh administration cannot allow the situation to deretiorate.The UT wants a 2-kilometre eco-sensitive zone in the Sukhna’s catchments, while the Punjab government is trying to keep it to just 100 metres.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73318098,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-224552,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sukhnas-11-yr-money-drought-hc-asks-why/articleshow/73309998.cms

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday urged the Centre not to postpone the Union budget due to the model code of conduct that is in place for Delhi polls.The CM said public welfare was above political benefits for him and the development of the capital should not suffer. He demanded ample funds for Delhi to augment the transport infrastructure, fight pollution, clean the Yamuna, improve sanitation and expand the metro network. The CM, who will soon write to the Centre, also sought funds for the municipal corporations.The Union budget is due just seven days before the assembly elections on February 8. “I have been under pressure from party functionaries to write to the Election Commission objecting to the budget being presented on February 1.

492,['17/01/2020'],Nagpur: Allen Career Institute to have residential coaching facility,"This story is from January 17, 2020

NAGPUR: It hasn’t been long since Nagpur has witnessed a linear growth in highly organized coaching centres. In the recent past, the coaching institutes have flourished, competing neck and neck with each other and promising hopeful parents a bright future for their children.

Coaching isn’t what it used to be earlier where students would all cram into the ‘masterji’s’ living room and study together.

Coaching institutes are now known for uniquely designed uniforms, excellent infrastructure, latest ‘modules’ on all subjects, online and offline tests, and expert and technologically advanced counselling.

These coaching centres have streamlined their functioning to the extent that students are denied entry if they do not show ID cards.

However, these facilities come at a price. Students have to shell out hefty fees every year to avail quality education. The demand for coaching centres has increased considerably with more number of students opting for competitive examinations for admission to medical and engineering colleges.

Not surprisingly, coaching giants mainly based at places known as education hubs of the country, have now found in Nagpur a potential destination to attract students with state-of-the-art facilities. Such coaching classes have established themselves in the city and are earning handsomely for innovative ways to help students crack the toughest examinations of the country.

Allen Career Institute is setting up Central India’s first residential coaching facility a few kilometres from Nagpur airport that boasts of a community hall, recreation room, open gym, sports areas, security, CCTV surveillance and shopping complex. There will be separate buildings for boys and girls who can get coaching and live comfortably at the same place.

The venture looks promising for those who move to Nagpur from other places for education. Officials of Allen Career Institute announced this facility at a press conference on Thursday. The expected fees, that includes stay and meals, is about Rs8,500 per month. In the first year, this facility will be open to Std XII pass students aspiring to clear NEET.

The facility has been designed to house over 300 students. The institute will later expand to admit students aspiring to appear for other competitive examinations, and also introduce more courses.

Hyderabad: State unit of Bharatiya Janata Party said that all promises made by TRS for municipalities were completely forgotten, including the one regarding double-bed room houses at a minimum cost of Rs 5 lakh.

In a document, which BJP termed ‘chargesheet’, the saffron party said: “In the first phase it was announced that there will be 500-1,000 houses, but nothing really happened.”

BJP said that TRS regime did not send 2.42 lakh applications received under the Pradhan Mantri Avas Yojana to the central government. The document also alleged that though the Centre is releasing Rs 1,000 crore for municipalities, the state government is not releasing a matching sum as part of its share.

Lucknow: From new academic session, Lucknow University will implement choice-based credit system (CBCS) at all its post graduation and PhD courses.

The CBCS will offer more learning options to students.

The system was earlier in place only in science courses at PG level.

“The introduction of CBCS will be a major boost to the quality of education imparted at the university level. It will offer more learning options to students with greater flexibility. They will get an opportunity to learn extra subject apart from their core courses,” said spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava.

In a meeting of all heads and deans held on Thursday, it was decided that massive open online courses — which is an online learning and knowledge testing system made available by the ministry of human resource development will be a part of CBCS.

“It will also give students interdisciplinary and intra-disciplinary options, for example, in the inter-disciplinary choice option, a student of science can learn a subject from humanities while in case of intra-disciplinary, a science student of zoology at PG level will also have an option to study botany as one of the subjects,” Srivastava said.

He further added students will also get an option to learn a subject without appearing in any examination of the same,” he added.

The move will give a student of arts the option of studying a course on arts or a language or course of other streams like commerce and science. Similarly, students of other streams will have various option to enhance their the knowledge that will help them in competitive examination and inter-disciplinary research.
