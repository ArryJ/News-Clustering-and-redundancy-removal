0,['27/01/2020'],Reel Kapil vs real Kapil at the Chepauk stadium,"It felt like a match day at the MA Chidambaram Stadium (Chepauk stadium) in Chennai, with live commentary by Krishnamachari Srikkanth. At the crease was Ranveer Singh and bowling to him was Kapil Dev , while the ‘Kapil’s Devils’ from the film 83 was fielding. As the game progressed, Ranveer even managed a hook shot off Kapil’s bowling. Then, they swapped places, with Kapil taking the bat and Ranveer bowling to him. Even as they enjoyed a few moments of cricket at the Chepauk stadium, they chatted about the making of 83 (a film that chronicles Kapil Dev’s journey and India’s historic win at the 1983 World Cup) and memories of the game. Excerpts from the conversation:If you ask of us what we miss about 1983 today, I would say that we miss the energy we had inside the team bus and the dressing room. Those things we miss, sometimes, even more than playing cricket.It’s more than a film. It’s a story that’s probably about one of the most glorious chapters in the history of our nation itself. It even changed the attitude of the nation. Suddenly, Indians looked upon themselves. Because what the Indian team of 83 did was unprecedented and unheard of. I didn’t know half of the things that happened back then. When Kabir sir narrated the story, I was like, ‘Aise ho? Aise thodi? It’s not possible’.One day, Jiiva came to me for tuition. ‘Saar, eppadi aadanum. Konjam sollikudunga, saar!’. I told him, ‘Inga paaru kanna, nee chumma poyi naalu suthu suthu. Sariyayidum’ (laughs).I still remember what Chikka (Srikkanth) sir told me. ‘Chumma kanna moodi suthuda. Patta baghyam, padalenna leghyam’. (laughs).I have said this a million times. There was only one guy who believed from day one of the 1983 World Cup that India could become the world champions and that was Kapil Dev. He taught us the concept of self-belief. Your boss gives you targets, right? It was like that. Roger Binny and I were like, ‘What the heck is this guy talking? Beating West Indies?’. But this guy was so serious about it, man!When we (the players of 1983) were told about making this film, our first reaction was like, ‘No, we don’t want to do that’. Because we felt that we were still young and a story should be about something that happened 50 or 100 years ago. But at the end, everybody, including me, said, ‘Fine, if they want to give us respect and love through the film, then, why not?’.I remember seeing that match (1983 World Cup final) as a school kid. I saw the whole world around me explode and go mad. At that point of time, I didn’t know why the whole world reacted the way it did then. Now, when I make the film 83, I exactly know the reasons why it was like that. It’s one of those stories that’s been staring at our faces for the last 36 years, yet nobody picked it up. I am really glad that none picked it up because that’s why I got a chance to do it.On the first day of the training itself, when the ball came at a certain height, the Natraj shot came naturallyKamal Haasan, who launched the first look poster of the film, said, “I heard about the touching moments that director Kabir Khan told me, which we didn’t know. The cricketers were not even given enough laundry budget and they were supposed to wash their clothes on the tour. We see movies called Avengers with a lot of supermen flying around. But these cricketers are the true avengers. I was also told that there is a very important sad story but very heroic in its own way, which the team had recorded it in the film.”Kamal added, “It is very difficult playing real people. The best thing to do is to be yourself, but respect and admire them. I think Ranveer Singh has done that in whatever little I have seen of the film.Mimicking can be slightly insulting. You need to imbibe the spirit to play a role, and play Kapil Dev. Also, Srikkanth… he’s such an effervescent guy and it is very difficult to emulate him.” Looking at Jiiva he said, “I am keen to see what you’ve done, Jiiva.”He said that, as the filmmaker of Hey Ram, he envied Kabir Khan. “This is the best compliment I can give you. I wish I had directed the film. But I don’t have that much experience in cricket and passion as Kabir Khan. And that’s why I can’t whine about it; instead, I feel proud about it.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73636309,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1053131/73636309.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/reel-kapil-vs-real-kapil-at-the-chepauk-stadium/articleshow/73636309.cms
1,['27/01/2020'],Listening to the National Anthem before a game gets us charged up: Women’s football league captains,"FacebookTwitterPintrest

Ahead of the launch of Indian Women’s League for football that is currently underway in Bengaluru, we caught up with the captains of the 12 teams. These women, range from some who have been playing the game on a professional level for over two decades, and a few more who are involved in the game even as they pursue their undergraduate courses. Each player, though, is thrilled to be able to captain their team and hope to take back the trophy to their club.Shyama Rani, captain of BBK Dav FC from Punjab, points out that this league, in its fourth season now, is a good start to encouraging women to pursue a career in the game. “We need more such platforms. This first league is a good step. We need to keep at the practices even after the leagues and tournaments in order to move ahead,” she adds. Ashalatha Devi, who hails from Manipur and captains Sethu FC, adds that sponsorship and other such incentives are missing in women’s football. “Players who hail from smaller leagues in men’s football have sporting companies sponsoring their kits and other gear. Not a single player from women’s football has received such a sponsorship. If we get such backing and incentives, parents of women playing football will feel secure. It will also act as an incentive to push girls to pursue the sport,” she adds.Mooting the thought is Amoolya Kamal, captain of Bengaluru United FC, who also questions why men’s football, despite the growing popularity, doesn’t see as many endorsement deals as the cricket team gets. “We need more people to call Sunil Chhetri for an advertisement that is done by Virat Kohli, for instance. While the awareness is growing, there needs to be more push by people on social media, along with more press coverage,” she adds.Anita Rawat, captain of Kickstart FC, believes that it is easy for one to give up in a team sport. So, keeping oneself motivated all the time is important. “Youngsters who may not be able to perform well on a certain day or week might be asked to sit on the bench during games. This can bring one’s morale down and can even get them to consider quitting the sport. Instead, they should look at the seniors and get inspired,” she adds. Priya Mistry, captain of Baroda Football Academy, reiterates, “It is a team game. Whether you’re on the field or on the bench, you remain a part of the team and you must never lose focus. Dedication and hard work is important. When you have that opportunity, be proud and patient when standing up to the task.”Ashalatha says it is the National Anthem that inspires her, a sentiment that others agree upon too. “When I enter the ground and we sing our National Anthem, I get goosebumps and get emotional. The outcome of that feeling itself is important to give me that strength,” she says.Poli Koley, captain of Sreebhumi FC, Kolkata, says it was the Indian team jersey that she received a week before her father succumbed to cancer that keeps her inspired. “My father was bedridden, but he had tears in his eyes when he saw my name in the newspaper. So, when I got back home, I gave him my jersey to wear. I want to reach higher and ensure my father's dreams for me are realised.”Others agree that the Indian team jersey is a big motivation. Amoolya says, “When I got the number 14 jersey for India, I got emotional and my eyes welled up with tears, as I got to realise my dream. From that day, I’ve always prayed to the jersey, irrespective of which team I am playing for. The little prayer gives me a lot of confidence in myself.”The captains agree that women’s football is taking small steps towards growing bigger. But, there is a lot that needs to change, and they believe that begins with the approach and mindsets of parents. Amoolya, who is a coach too, says, “When it comes to women’s football, parents play an important role. Many parents think ‘usse lag jayega’ and also ‘puberty ke time pe kya meri bachchi khel sakti hai’, I have had many parents tell me that it is better if I coach as opposed to men coaching their daughters. This mindset needs to change. Not many girls choose football, so when someone has chosen that path, parents need to support her, instead of creating roadblocks.”- (With inputs from Hansy.Sanctis@timesgroup.com)",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73634701,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-344721/73634701.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/listening-to-the-national-anthem-before-a-game-gets-us-charged-up-womens-football-league-captains/articleshow/73634484.cms

4,['27/01/2020'],"Move over ‘ghosting’ and ‘catfishing’, dating terms now have pop culture references","Trying to find bae? Then focus on how you communicate with your special someone. That online dating has kind of changed the way people meet and connect is no secret. Interestingly, whether or not you follow the new lingo, there is a term to describe all your adventures (or misadventures). A closer look at words like ‘ghosting’ and ‘breadcrumbing’ also shows how pop culture as well as our favourite movie and telly characters have influenced the online dating lexicon. So, if you’re game for upgrading your vocabulary, here’s a ready reckoner…Yes, that’s right. ‘Kanye-d’ is inspired by American rapper Kanye West. This refers to a situation when you’re on a date or in a relationship with someone, but you don’t get to talk about yourself at all, because the other person is busy bragging about himself or herself.“I heard that he Kanye-d her on their first date itself.”Picture this: You’re finally with your dream girl or guy, and suddenly, there comes a red flag. He or she turns out to be a completely different personality, similar to the lead characters of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Inspired by their personality differences, ‘Jekylling’ is referred to someone who becomes nasty if you turn them down over a small thing.“It was all cool till she started jekkylling me when I cancelled our dinner date.”This term is inspired by actress-director Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s award-winning series, Fleabag, in which the lead character faces a lot of difficulties because of her dating choices. What led to the coining of the term ‘fleabagging’ was her falling for a ‘hot priest’ in a church. Now, this term is most commonly used when one falls for the wrong person.“These past few men in my life have made it a complete Fleabag of things.”This term emerged after actor Keanu Reeves’s fans were taken aback when he made a quick appearance on the red carpet of an event, hand-in-hand with his girlfriend, artist Alexandra Grant. The actor, who is known to keep his personal life under wraps, had sent netizens into a frenzy after this buzzy appearance. ‘Keanu-ing’, thus, means surprising everyone by making a grand entry into a party along with your new love interest.“She pulled off a total Keanu, I wouldn’t have guessed them together at all.”Adding a character reference to the already popular term ‘ghosting’, ‘Caspering’ is when your date drops enough hints for you to guess the obvious before he/she disappears or ghosts you.“So, you picked him up last night, or are you caspering him again?”Do you feel that your partner is ‘frozen’ when it comes to commitment? This term is commonly used for relationships, in which one of the partners often develops cold feet. ‘Elsa-d’ is inspired by the popular Disney character Elsa, who froze her sister, Anna, by mistake, over an argument. Her frozen heart led to the birth of the term online.“I heard that he Elsa-d her right before she walked down the aisle.”Sandra Bullock’s award-winning film, Bird Box, is what led to the term ‘bird-boxing’. It refers to a partner in a relationship whoignores bad behaviour.“Greta, I know that you can see me standing here. Don’t bird-box me.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73635942,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-221291/73635942.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/move-over-ghosting-and-catfishing-dating-terms-now-have-pop-culture-references/articleshow/73635231.cms

All previous civilisations have been wiped out, everything has regressed back in time and all traces of technology and gadgetry has been wiped out,” explains the director. It’s at this juncture, wherein the last few amongst the survivors are looking to expand their clan, the film delves into the happenings in their life. “The poster shows Anupama who plays Dwaya , her love interest Ekva played by Satya BG, and Trinini, essayed by Mayuri Nataraja , standing atop a cliff and pensively looking forward to a better future. There’s a halo behind them and a symbolic snake that is eating itself which a reference I’ve drawn from the Bhasmasura tale. Set in a fictitious land, there’s a mountain, Rikta that has borne silent witness to their lives and it stands tall in the background,” explains Pradeep, adding that Bhavani Prakash and Raghava also play prominent roles.

7,['27/01/2020'],"If I could, I would have become a hero in my 20s: Director Vikas","He was the director behind Duniya Vijay ’s Jayammana Maga , and since then, he has worked on Puneeth Rajkumar’s Doddmane Huduga. However, it is Vikas’ debut film as hero, Kaanadante Maayavadanu , that has kept him busy over the past four years. The process has been “emotionally and physically challenging, but has taught me patience,” he says, as he recounts his journey with the film, which he believes, will decide his future in the industry.When I was a kid, I would see villains being quelled by heroes and I wanted to be like them too. It seems to be a funny and childish thought, but that was the initial spark that got me interested in acting. In fact, before I directed Jayammana Maga in 2013, I entered the industry in 2002 and played a role in Sudeep sir’s film, Nandhi. So, even though this is my first film as hero, it is not my acting debut.I got very frustrated. The time the process took, got to me and took a mental and physical toll on me. I started looking aged as the film progressed, because I was getting stressed (laughs). We know that the product is top-class. When promoting it, what worried me was that there was not much hype around the film. Just like you can’t ‘make’ viral content, you cannot ‘create’ hype. In the process of worrying, I would not eat or sleep well. There are certain things I cannot control, but ultimately, people will recognise good content, and that realisation has made me calmer.I realised how crucial the hero’s walk was — walking with attitude and confidence takes practice. It took me a few takes to get it right. I often felt lost while watching my co-stars — be it Suchendra Prasad or Sindhu Loknath . I was stunned by their prowess. If I could control things, I would have become a hero in my twenties. Right now, I can’t act like a college-goer who’s romancing girls. It won’t be convincing. I want to take on roles that suit my demeanour. I know that many stars have had a second lease of life after 40, especially in Hollywood. Actors still get a lot of work and take up interesting scripts. Those are the kind of roles I wish to play. I have learnt how challenging marketing one’s film can be. Everyone wants their movie to be promoted on a big scale. But, one realises that stars have that kind of pull, because they have worked their way up and built an audience. Given that this is my first outing as a hero, I have realised that building an audience takes time. I would consider this movie as an invitation card, like a preview to what I can do. Depending on how the audiences respond, things will either go to a great level or I will take my leave from the industry (chuckles).My dedication towards perfecting my project, and reworking on it, have helped me sustain myself in the industry. Even after working on a film for a long time, it should not get boring. That’s my mantra. Scripting also comes easily to me and I have only worked on two scripts in the last few years. If I focus on scripting, perhaps I can do a lot more. Let’s see. God is writing my script. So, I do not know what he has in store.My constant source of support has been Som Singh sir, the producer of this film, who also happens to be my brother-in-law. In my life, I have spent more than I have earned. And my family has always been my support. As the release date is close, I am worried about the audiences’ reaction. Som has seen the struggles I have gone through and asked me to think of this as my last try. He said, “If this doesn’t work, quit the industry. Say goodbye and work with me.” So, this film will decide my future (smiles).",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73636472,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-414787/73636472.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/if-i-could-i-would-have-become-a-hero-in-my-20s-director-vikas/articleshow/73636472.cms

10,['27/01/2020'],"As govt decides to go global with tribal products, focus on quality standards","This story is from January 27, 2020

NEW DELHI: With Prime Minister Narendra Modi directing the concerned ministries to build a global market for products made by tribals and branding them with quality standards, the government is planing to consult the Bureau of Indian Standards and Food Safety and Standard Authority.

They will explore standardisation that can be applicable for various categories of products made for sale in the tribal belts.

It is also proposed to identify large retail chains for marketing support for tribal products and non-timber forest produce in consultation with business chambers’ like Ficci, CII and Assocham.

The focus on tribal goods follows a review by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 9 where he is learnt to have called for coordinated efforts to build a global market for tribal products in ""mission mode"". While Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India, will work on value addition of products from the tribal belts and the on ground linkages to bring the products, ministry of commerce will facilitate the national and internation market linkages including the online outreach.

After a meeting on January 12 with the officials of TRIFED, ministry of tribal affairs, and ministry of minority affairs, commerce minister Piyush Goyal is learnt to have issued directions for also exploring railways as a customer and sale facilitator.

On February 9, the various stakeholders will come together to firm up the plan to execute the outreach and linkages. To promote products of TRIFED, officials have been asked to identify “design, packaging and marketing components” and also identify partners including ad-gurus and designers of repute. The officials will also be identifying clusters to initiate such activities, sources, privy to discussions and directions issued at the meeting, said.

In a video shared on Twitter on January 14, Goyal said, “Have promised PM that over the next 3 years, every Indian citizen will at least buy one product, if not more, which is produced by our tribal brothers & sisters.” Retweeting it, TRIFED MD Pravir Krishna committed to leave no stone unturned to match up to Goyal’s expectations.

Aiming to provide backward-forward linkages, it is learnt that the the designing, branding and marketing plan will focus on two key components - the traditional tribal art and craft products from across states and the non-timber minor forest produce that will be processed into final products at the Pradhan Mantri Van Dhan Kendras (VDVK) at the grassroots. There are plans to explore how the marketing component can integrate the products that are brought for sale by artisans and craftsmen at “Hunar Haats” organised acorss cities from time to time by the ministry of minority affairs.

Since the pan-India roll out of the Van Dhan programme last year, so far 676 VDVKs have been sanctioned in 148 districts of 18 states. These VDVKs will link 2,00,740 tribal households to livelihood generation. TRIFED has a target of setting up 3,000 VDVKs every year to cover 45 lakh tribal households and 2 crore tribal beneficiaries under the programme over five years.

At the meeting chaired by Goyal, it was also decided to identify 100 items to drive promotion of tribal products within and outside the country, sources said. There are also plans to explore opportunities for international retail, exhibitions and business meets.

In Delhi for the auditions of 'India's Best Dancer', Bharti and Haarsh talk about their experience of working together, the changing scenario of comedy in India, and more.Before coming together for 'India's Best Dancer', the couple did shows like ' Khatra Khatra Khatra ', 'Khatron Ke Khiladi' and 'Nach Baliye' together. The duo says that while they do have to work on their script, their on-screen bond that comes across to the viewers comes naturally to them. ""Whenever we are working together, main bilkul relaxed ho jaati hoon. I don't have to do much work. The one who used to teach me earlier, jo script likhta tha mere liye and samjhata tha mujhe, ab jab woh act bhi kar raha hai, toh I am very relaxed,"" says Bharti. Haarsh adds, ""Thoda pressure aa jaata hai mujhpe lekin hum log prepare karke jaate hai. But jo bonding hamari screen par dikhti hai, jo hamara masti mazaak dikhta hai woh ham kabhi prepare nahi kar paate. Woh sab spontaneous hota hai. That comes naturally to us and we just go with the flow.""Bharti and Haarsh say that they are impressed by the pool of talent in the capital. ""Delhi ke log bahut talented hain. It is so cold here but inn logon ka jazba kam nahi hai. Raat bhar se line mein lage hue hain,"" says Bharti. Haarsh tells us, ""I am surprised to see the number of talented dancers in the city. With so many dance reality shows on TV, I thought that there is not much left to discover. But I was wrong.""Talking about Dilli ka khaana, Haarsh tells us that everything is delicious here. ""I really like the food here. Honestly speaking, Mumbai mein sab kuch milta hai lekin achha khaana nahi milta. Yahaan par toh kuch bhi kha lo, everything is delicious,"" he says.Haarsh Limbachiyaa and Bharti SinghBharti began doing comedy on television 12 years ago, and she feels that over time, people have learnt to take humour in good stride. She tells us, ""There are a lot of people who just want to laugh, and there are others who want satire. But these days people have become a lot more intelligent. Aajkal mazaak lene lag gaye hain log."" ""India's comedy scene has seen a tremendous change in the last ten years,"" says Haarsh, adding that while comedy on TV has evolved, people still want desi humour. ""We have new topics to explore now. Jab nayi baatein karte hain toh comedy bhi nayi lagti hai, but logon ko aaj bhi sabse zyada hansi desi humour par hi aati hai,"" says Haarsh.While the TV industry (drama genre) is ruled by women, comedy is visibly male-dominated. Talking about the same, Bharti explains, ""People either want to be a model, or bag the lead role in a show. Kisi ko apna mazaak nahi banwana. Pata nahi kis baat ki sharam hai unmein. Maybe that is the reason why there are fewer female comedians on TV. Mujhe bhi dukh hota hai to see such a state, and I wish there were more women in this genre, too.""As a writer, Haarsh believes that it is easier to write jokes for a man playing a woman instead of writing them for a female artiste. He explains, ""Sunil (Grover) paaji ladki ban kar kuch bhi kar sakte hai, we can ask him to say anything, but we can't do that with a woman. Kahin na kahin woh daayra hota hai and that's why we ask people like Sunil ji and Krushna (Abhishek) to dress up as women. You will never find comedy in real things, but you will laugh when Sunil ji dresses up in a weird fashion.""",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73633121,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-295089/73633121.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/bharti-singh-delhi-ke-logon-mein-bahut-talent-aur-jazba-hai/articleshow/73633003.cms

BEIJING/NEW DELHI: India on Sunday opened a third hotline for its 250-odd students and other citizens caught in the coronavirus-induced lockdown in Wuhan even as China offered to evacuate Americans stranded there, raising hopes of similar arrangements being made for Indians.Although there is no official confirmation yet, the government is believed to have requested the Chinese authorities to enable the evacuation of Indian students in Wuhan, most of them studying medicine.The additional hotline opened on Sunday is meant to help cope with a “large number” of phone calls the Indian embassy in Beijing has been receiving from Indians at Wuhan in Hubei province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak that has already claimed 58 lives amid fears that the rate of infection could jump 50% over the next few days.“In view of the large number of calls received on the two hotline numbers set up by the embassy of India in Beijing in connection with the outbreak of coronavirus infection, the embassy has decided to open a third hotline number +8618610952903,” the embassy said in a tweet on Sunday. The other two hotline numbers are +8618612083629 and +8618612083617.“Over the last two days, our hotlines have fielded nearly 600 calls to respond to concerns regarding this difficult situation. The government and the embassy in Beijing are also examining all options, including through consultations with Chinese authorities, to provide relief to our affected citizens,” the embassy said.Foreign minister S Jaishankar , too, tweeted that India was closely monitoring the situation in Wuhan. “Our embassy in Beijing is constantly checking on the health and well-being of the Indians in China. Please follow @EOIBeijing for more updates on the situation.”About 700 Indian students are estimated to be studying in universities in Wuhan and its nearby areas. The majority of these students are said to have left Wuhan and other areas of Hubei province during the Chinese New Year holidays a few weeks ago. The rest stayed back, little knowing that Wuhan and 12 other cities would be sealed off to stop the coronavirus outbreak from spreading.“As of now, we understand that no Indian citizen has been affected by the outbreak and food and water supplies are available to them,” India’s ambassador to China, Vikram Misri, said. In the past 24 hours, China has reported 15 more coronavirus deaths and confirmed 680 new cases.

PM Modi pays homage to the martyrs at the National War Memorial, on the occasion of the 71st Republic Day Para... Read More

NEW DELHI: Violence has never resolved any issue and no problem in the world can be solved by creating another problem, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday, calling for a “new India” where fair and just solutions can be found to long-festering issues.

Speaking in the context of a recent settlement of Bru people with Tripura and Mizoram reaching an agreement and efforts to conclude more peace pacts with militant groups in the Northeast, the PM said patient negotiation and a fair approach to long pending problems had paid off.

“It can only be solved by seeking an optimal solution. Come, let’s together forge a new India, where every issue is resolved on a platform of peace. Solidarity should be the key to resolving every issue. And brotherhood should foil every separatist attempt to divide us,” Modi said in his first ‘ Mann ki Baat ’ radio address of the year.

Though Modi’s comments came in the context of insurgencies in the Northeast, they assume significance in view of ongoing protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act which have on occasion taken a violent turn and the agitation against the National Population Register . Though Modi’s reference was largely to militants holding out against negotiated settlements, his approach lent itself to broader application.

“On the solemn occasion of Republic Day, I would appeal to anyone in any part of the country, who is still seeking solutions to problems through violence and weapons, to return to the mainstream. They should have faith in their own capabilities and capabilities of this country to resolve issues peacefully,” Modi said while noting 644 militants of eight different groups surrendered with their weapons in Assam a few days ago.

“Those who had strayed towards the path of violence have expressed their faith in peace and decided to become a partner in the country’s progress and return to the mainstream,” he said.

“Those who had picked up weapons thinking that violence could solve problems now firmly believe that the only way to solve any dispute is peace and togetherness. Countrymen will be thrilled to know that insurgency in the north-east has considerably reduced,” he added.

The PM sought to remind listeners of the recent agreement which would help rehabilitation of 34,000 Bru refugees in Tripura. In 1997, ethnic tension forced the Bru-Reang tribe to leave Mizoram and seek refuge in Tripura. These refugees were kept in temporary camps in Kanchanpur in north Tripura. An attempt to relocate them to their original home in Mizoram proved problematic, and they will now remain in Tripura. “Just imagine, how difficult it must have been for them to live 23 long years in trying circumstances in camps. Governments came and went, but there was no cure for their pain. Despite that, their unwavering belief in the Indian Constitution and culture continued. It’s a result of that belief that their life is on the threshold of a new dawn today,” Modi said.

NEW DELHI: The government is set to clamp down on import of furniture and certain types of tyres, especially retreaded ones, amid concerns that cheap goods are flooding the market and pushing out domestic manufacturers .An official decision is expected over the next few days with a detailed analysis on furniture imports having already been undertaken by the commerce department , sources told TOI.Separately, certain types of gems are also on the radar for import curbs.In recent months, the government has stepped up efforts to reduce “non-essential” imports as part of a strategy to boost the ‘Make in India’ initiative, which has been hit by companies holding up investments due to the economic slowdown.As reported in TOI on December 3, the government has identified over 350 “non-essential” imports, ranging from toys and electronics to footwear and textiles goods, on which quality standards, higher duties as well as licensing (as opposed to free imports) are being worked out.Sources said furniture imports have emerged as an area of concern in recent years and are also plagued by a massive problem of under-invoicing, where the value of the goods being shipped into the country is shown to be lower than the actual import price, denying customs duty to the exchequer. “Many of these payments are being made through illegal channels, which is another issue that needs to be addressed,” a government officer said.In 2018-19, furniture imports (including bedding and mattress) were estimated at $1.8 billion (around Rs 12,500 crore), with government officers and industry players suggesting that office furniture was largely ‘Made in China’ and suffered from poor quality. Of this, close to $1 billion came from China, commerce department data showed.Between April and November 2019, the trend has continued with imports estimated at around $1.1 billion, of which Chinese shipments were about $637 million.While tyre imports fell over 10% in the last financial year, the problem is largely due to shipments from Thailand and China, both for new and retreaded tyres. Of the $430 million of new tyre imports in 2018-19, around $127 million was from Thailand, with around $92 million coming from China. Similarly, of the $15.5 million worth of retreaded tyres imported into the country, almost half came from Thailand.“This concern has been there for the last few years and there has been a discussion around restricting retreaded tyres, which is also a demand from the industry,” the government officer said.A section within the government is, however, of the view that import restrictions may not be the best way to boost domestic manufacturing and the Centre should focus on sectors where India is competitive or segments such as electric vehicles or electronics where global demand is expected to rise significantly in the coming years.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73645950,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-871810,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/to-boost-desi-cos-curbs-likely-on-tyre-furniture-imports/articleshow/73645836.cms

The CAA is a matter that is entirely internal to India . This legislation has been adopted by due process and through democratic means after a public debate in both Houses of Parliament,” an official source said.The government expressed hope that as fellow democracies, the EU Parliament would not take any action that calls into question the rights of democratically elected legislatures.The resolution, tabled by European United Left/Nordic Green Left Group, is set to be debated on Wednesday and voted upon the day after. It made a reference to the Charter of the United Nations , Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the India-EU Strategic Partnership Joint Action Plan signed in November 2005, and to the EU-India Thematic Dialogue on Human Rights.

Click here to read all Budget-related news

NEW DELHI: The government is estimating a hit of around Rs 1 lakh crore due to a reduction in corporation tax, against Rs 1.45 lakh crore calculated when the move was announced in September.Official said this estimate was based on an analysis of advance tax payments and will provide much-needed cushion to the Centre, which is battling an acute fiscal strain, with tax collections expected to be significantly lower than the budget estimate of Rs 24.6 lakh crore on gross basis. During the current year, corporation tax collections were estimated at a little under Rs 7.7 lakh crore.For existing companies, the base corporation tax rate has been reduced from 30% to 22%, while new manufacturing companies will only face a 15% levy if they are incorporated after October 1, 2019, and commence operations before March 31, 2023. The decision, however, came with the rider that companies will have to give up on exemptions if they want to opt for the lower rate.Tax consultants pointed out that several companies are yet to decide on whether to move to a 22% levy or continue with the existing mechanism as the effective rate works out to be much lower.“Profitable banks and FMCG companies will find it beneficial to move to the new rate as there is an immediate benefit but infrastructure or some of companies engaged in exports may continue because the effective rate is lower (currently),” said Sudhir Kapadia, who leads the tax practice at consulting firm EY.He said companies that pay minimum alternate tax (MAT) have credit lying on their books, which is holding them back from shifting to the new system as they stand to lose.For IT-enabled services and many other service companies, the gain may be significant, prompting them to shift to the new regime, added Rahul Garg, partner and tax technology leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers India. “Some of the taxpayers for whom the exemptions have expired or are expiring, may avail of this (the new structure),” he told TOI.While most consultants are unwilling to give out numbers, Neeru Ahuja, tax partner at Deloitte India said out of a sample of 100 companies, over half have shifted to the new regime, while around one-tenth are undecided. An important consideration for many has been the possibility of claiming higher dividends.“Many companies have opted for the new scheme of lower corporate tax on further accounting analysis and impact. Opting for a lower rate has also allowed some companies to write-back excess provisions of deferred taxes, which in turn helps the company in having a better bottomline and profits,” she said.EY’s Kapadia said that some of the companies will decide on a changeover in the coming months.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73657154,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1313019,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-may-get-rs-40k-crore-cushion-on-corporation-tax-cut/articleshow/73646318.cms

There is a possibility that gagannauts, could be one or three, will be able to communicate with ISS astronauts... Read More

NEW DELHI: India’s gagannauts will be sent to space at an altitude of 400km, the same height the International Space Station (ISS) orbits around the Earth .

There is a possibility that gagannauts, could be one or three, will be able to communicate with ISS astronauts when they are sent to space by December next year.

Talking to TOI, Isro chairman K Sivan said, “A human-rated advanced GSLVMkIII carrying the human crew capsule will be sent to space. The capsule carrying the astronauts will be positioned around 400km altitude, where they will perform various experiments, including microgravity tests.”

Coincidentally, the International Space Station (ISS), a joint project of five space agencies — Nasa (US), Roscosmos (Russia), CSA (Canada), JAXA (Japan) and ESA (Europe) — maintains an orbit at the same altitude of 400km by means of reboost manoeuvres and circles around the Earth 15 times daily. About the possibility of interaction between gagannauts and ISS, the Isro chief did not rule out the possibility but said, “We have not thought on those lines and right now, we don’t have the facility.”

For setting up a communicaton system with gagannauts, Sivan said, “A constellation of two geo satellites constituting the Indian Data Relay Satellite System will establish the space communication system that will help the space crew talk to the ground station. The first geo satellite will be launched before the first unmanned testflight. The second satellite before the second unmanned testflight (June 2021) next year.” There is a possibility that this system could be used by gagannauts to establish a contact with the ISS.

On whether animals would be sent to space before humans, Sivan said, “only a ‘Vyommitra’ (lady robot) will be sent to space in the unmanned flights. No animals will be taken.” The vyommitra will help test various systems on board to ensure they are compatible for humans to travel to space without any safety hazard.

While spacesuit and other components like crew seats and windows for the Gaganyaan mission will be provided by Russia, France is likely to provide medicine kit and train Indian flight surgeons to enable them to monitor the health of astronauts. The 11-month astronaut training of four shortlisted IAF pilots in Russia is going to start by January-end. Thereafter, the astronauts will undergo mission-specific training on simulators back in India.

NEW DELHI: Come February 8 and the 1.8 lakh voters of the Kalkaji assembly constituency will have to choose between an education activist credited with a key role in reforming school education in Delhi and Kalkaji ki beti. Giving them active competition will be a former councillor.The triangular contest pits AAP’s Atishi against Shivani Chopra, daughter of three-time MLA and Congress Delhi unit chief Subhash Chopra, and Dharambir Singh of BJP, who contested the 2013 assembly poll as an AAP nominee before reverting to his parent party.Located between the Nehru Place highrises and the slum belt, the Kalkaji constituency has a widely diverse electorate consisting of Sikh and Punjabi refugee families who arrived after Partition and the economically marginalised groups of migrants from Poorvanchal and West Bengal.Aam Aadmi Party has replaced its sitting MLA, Avtar Singh Kalka, with one of the best known faces in its ranks, Atishi, who, as advisor to deputy CM and education minister Manish Sisodia, inspired the rejuvenation of the city’s government schools. In Kalkaji, Atishi said that the concerns were about local realities like bijli, paani, naali, schools and hospitals. “People have seen and benefitted from the work done by Arvind Kejriwal's government. Kalkaji residents are going to vote on that performance and for the further development of their neighbourhood,"" she said with quiet optimism.The assembly has more than 25 JJ camps, most of them named after big political icons. The slum-dwellers, concentrated in Sriniwaspuri and Govindpuri municipal wards, are traditionally Congress voters and still the AAP sweep of 2015, had voted for Subhash Chopra in 1998, 2003 and 2008.It is his legacy that Congress banks on this year as it strives to revive itself. Shivani Chopra, 40, the daughter, is accordingly projecting herself as Kalkaji ki beti.The self-professed vegan and barrister-at-law from Inns of Court School of Law, London, claims familiarity with the constituency’s people and insists her father has been at their side whether in or out of power. Shivani said that the chain of development begun during Sheila Dikshit’s three-term tenure was interrupted by AAP and she would aim to restart the process. “Flyovers, road development and Delhi metro began under us and we will take it forward,” she said. The first-time contestant countered her main rival’s education thrust by saying, “Safety is the biggest demand of youth and women. When our kids do not feel safe, what kind of education can they hope for?”But Shivani may have to contend with some unfulfilled promises of the past. People have not forgotten Congress promised to rehabilitate JJ camp residents in flats through in-situ slum development in 2009. Rama Shankar, a 50-year-old rickshaw puller shrugged, “Before every election we have been promised pucca homes in place of our shacks, but nothing has ever materialised,” Shankar said, pointing at the forlorn foundation stone, a reminder of the unkept promise.AAP registers a strong presence in these JJ camps now. Muzaffar Ali, who lives in a Govindpuri slum, explained why. “Many developmental projects have been undertaken in our neglected locality,” the 40-year-old said. “Water lines were laid two years ago and a new community toilet complex has been created. Most of all, people are happy about their electricity bill waiver.”The BJP’s candidate is an old hand in the region. Some believe the former municipal councillor might prove to be a dark horse in a race that is currently focused on AAP and Congress, both of whose supporters are the economically disadvantaged groups. More than 40% of the voters in the urban belt are refugees who settled here after Partition and characteristically called “double-storeywalas” because of the structures of the old houses allocated to them in the 1950s.Dharambir Singh relies on these voters and those in Maharani Bagh, Sukhdev Vihar and other neighbourhoods beset by congestion and parking woes.But even within this class, BJP may face resentment. Tajinder Singh, a garment shop owner in Lajpat Nagar’s Double Storey area, talked of the sealing pains. “These houses were allocated decades ago. Families have since grown and extensions have been made, so sealing them cannot be a solution to norm violations. BJP should have helped us out,” Singh said.While Singh disparages AAP’s subsidies on water and electricity, he promises freebies nevertheless. “Besides these subsidies, we will also provide houses to slum dwellers,” he said, and added, “There is a lot of support for Citizenship Amendment Act in the Sikh community. Unlike other states, being the country’s capital, Delhi also votes on national issues.” Atishi sharply retorted that the saffron party had to talk of CAA because as “far as BJP's agenda for Delhi is concerned, frankly there is none”.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73651336,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-458181,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/aap-cites-achievements-bjp-and-cong-bank-on-legacies/articleshow/73651339.cms

Gorakhpur: The first case of deadly coronavirus reported from Nepal has led to concerns in eastern UP, especially Gorakhpur, which is close to Indo-Nepal border and many people from the city commute to Nepal daily through Sonouli and Badni border.Though steps have been initiated for screening of the virus at the airport, experts believe that health check-up along the open border is a must to check its entry in India.“The virus is deadly and has already claimed lives in many countries. A case has been reported from Nepal too. We share 1751-km long open border with Nepal and checking virus only at the airport and not on borders will be an exercise in futility. Health check-posts should be established at entry points on Indo-Nepal border to check the entry of virus in the country,” Dr RN Singh, campaigner, Mission Save in India, said.“Checking for virus has already started at airport but open border between the two countries should be monitored,” he said. Singh said during SARS epidemic in 2002-03, they demanded health check-posts along Indo-Nepal border which was accepted by the government.“Around half-a-dozen cases of coronavirus have been detected in Thailand. Many people from here also go to Thailand and people from the country visit Gorakhpur. Health check-posts are the need of the hour,” he said.Chief medical officer Srikant Tiwari said an isolation ward would be set up at district hospital.“As of now, no case of coronavirus has been reported in Gorakhpur but the department is ready to deal with the situation.

COIMBATORE: Numismatics and philately enthusiasts in the city, along with the postal department, on Sunday released a ‘phila-numismatic’ special postal cover featuring the first-ever coin that was issued by the Indian Republic, to mark the 71st Republic Day celebrations .

The cover has two original ‘one pice’ copper coins , which were the first coins minted and issued by the Government of India after it became a republic in 1950. The coins, which come with the image of a galloping horse, were issued for six years from 1950 to 1955, said C Selvaraj, a numismatist and philatelist.

Selvaraj, who is also the secretary of city-based Aagar Coin Society, said he had sourced 3,000 coins from numismatists and enthusiasts from across the country. “We have produced 1,500 covers and each cover contains two coins. The value of the coin would be Rs20 today, as they are copper coins. We have priced the cover at Rs150,” he said. The cover, which is the fourth special cover to be released this year in the state, also has serial numbers. “Hence, it cannot be pirated.”

Before the decimalisation of Indian currency in 1957, one Indian rupee was equal to 64 paise. From 1957, it was changed to 100 paise and the older currency of annas were demonetised, said Sudhir Gopal Jakhere, senior superintendent of posts, Coimbatore division. As the coin can’t be legally tendered, they are now used as collectibles, he said.

In 2019, the Aagar Coin Society had released a special postal cover featuring one paise coin, called the ‘hole coin’. “We expected others to issue more such covers, but in vain. So, we have released the second such cover,” he said.

Jakhere said this was a ‘true numismatic cover’ concentrating on a coin issued by the Government of India. “The country became sovereign by first releasing a currency. It is an assertion of authority and an expression of economic independence. To commemorate the first currency released, we have released the cover on this Republic Day. We worked around 1.5 months to produce this. It was completely produced in the district,” he said.

28,['27/01/2020'],Act of Valor: A soldier’s resolve to live for the nation,"This story is from January 27, 2020

Secunderabad: At 19,000 feet and freezing temperatures, Colonel Tarun Kumar of the Indian Army was raring to go. He had volunteered to go to the Siachen glacier for Operation Meghdoot as the observation post officer (OPO). A day before his arrival, the enemy from across the border had hit an Indian post in the vicinity and an officer had died. Having lost a fellow soldier Tarun Kumar was waiting to give enemy a befitting reply.

Tarun Kumar from Delhi had joined the Indian Army in 1989 and was commissioned in the regiment of artillery, 38 Medium Regiment through IMA. In 1994, he got the opportunity to put to use all that he had learnt. He had displayed mettle by opting to be posted on the Siachen glacier and with an Indian army soldier having taken the brunt of firing by the enemy, Tarun and his team were all set to retaliate .

At around 7.30 pm while the team was getting ready to shoot at the enemy posts, there was an attack on their own post. Tarun, who was leading his men, did not realise that he was hit until one of the soldiers told him that he was bleeding.

After he was taken to the hospital, there were nine splinters in his body. One was in his chest between the rib and the heart. Another was on the spinal cord. Three splinters were embedded in the body and the surgeons suggested that they be allowed to remain there as they would not pose a threat to his life. But Tarun Kumar wanted all signs of the enemy removed from his body.

“I don’t want even a single splinter of my adversary in my body. I would not like to live with it even for a single day. I would rather take a bullet and die than live with any of the elements from my adversary’s ammunition,” he told the surgeons who obliged him and removed them.

After serving in the army of 29 years and having taken premature retirement in 2018, Col Tarun Kumar still cannot easily lift his right shoulder without experiencing pain. The trauma of Siachen has also not left him completely. But he is a complete person. He also taught those around him to fearless, including at the National Defence Academy (NDA) where he went as instructor later.

At the Indian Military Headquarters (IMH) in the Ministry of Defence in Delhi, Col Tarun Kumar was staff officer and given the responsibility of handling counter terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. If he escaped death by a whisper in Siachen, he did not want anyone to die at the hands of the enemy. “I did not join the Army to become a martyr. I wanted to live to fight the enemy and save my country. That was why I wanted to live,” Col Tarun Kumar who has settled in the city told TOI.

Intelligence inputs analysed in real-time by Col Tarun Kumar saved the life of a senior ranking army officer who was fighting terrorists in J&K. Tarun’s ability to think on his feet and his presence of mind saved may a days during his stint with the Intelligence.

Col Tarun Kumar also served in Sierra Leone as part of the UN Mission. He was the mission personnel officer from the Indian Army. Even there, the rebels were handled with tact and not allowed to have the upper hand when they carried out a plan against the army. During his 29 years with the Indian Army, Tarun proved that no enemy was daunting enough to intimidate a man whose mind was set on guarding his nation.

Coimbatore: The city corporation has tied up with a German firm to study the models that are followed in other cities in India and abroad to collect and process construction and demolition waste. The company is likely to submit its report at the earliest. Based on it, the civic body is expected to come up with a feasible model for the city.

Pointing out that the Coimbatore Builders and Contractors Association had come forward to sponsor machinery to process the construction and demolition waste as a part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities and that a team had visited such waste processing centres in Ahmedabad and Hyderabad, corporation commissioner J Sravan Kumar said they had also tied up with Germany-based Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH to study the models adopted in other cities and foreign countries to streamline the entire process.

“The firm is expected to submit the report by this month-end and the project is expected to commence within April,” he said.

The study is to find out how much is charged from the public, who transports the debris to the waste processing centre, and how debris are reused. “It will also look into whether the model is implemented as a public-private partnership or corporation has taken full responsibility. We need to adopt a suitable model,” he said.

Earlier, the construction and demolition debris were dumped either along the waterbodies or on vacant lands. To streamline the construction and demolition waste collection process, the city corporation has now notified 17 sites, where the public could dispose of the same.

While the city corporation is using a small portion of construction and demolition debris to level the roads, the remaining waste is getting accumulated at the sites now.

MYSURU: The 20-year-old tusker, which was found ill on Saturday at Gurupura village bordering Nagarahole, died on Sunday. The elephant’s body was burnt after postmortem in the evening.

“It was suffering from constipation. We found soil and mud in the intestine at the time of postmortem. The suspicion is that it died due to unclean water ,” said veterinarian Dr Muzeeb Ur Rehman.

“The lake water is not bad. I fear this tusker would have consumed the water stored inside the villages for various purposes including garlic crop. We sent a few parts of its body for FSL examination. We will get a clear picture about the cause of death of the tusker from FSL,” he said.

“Generally, the elephants consume sand and mud when they develop constipation. We treated it for the same symptoms. In 90% of the cases, the elephants recover. Unfortunately, this elephant didn't recover,” he said.

He also made it clear that the tusker was not electrocuted.

The tusker was found ill at the plantation of one local resident, Jagadish, on Saturday. Senior officials of the forest department rushed to the village and tried to lift it. Dasara elephant Gopalaswamy was used to make it stand on its legs. But the effort went in vain. The authorities continued treatment all night on Saturday and Sunday.

DCF Prashanth, ACF Paramesh and others visited the site and reviewed the situation.

Hundreds of villagers from neighbouring villages rushed to the plantation to see the treatment to the tusker.

Two crore people got together to fix schools, hospitals, electricity and water supply. But Amit Shah comes daily and makes fun of their hard work,” Kejriwal said.Kejriwal claimed that the result of Delhi government schools in the last academic session was 96%, while in other states it was just 40-50%. “About 16 lakh students of Delhi government schools, their parents and 65,000 teachers worked very hard to achieve this. Every year, more than 400 government schoolchildren clear IIT-JEE, but you make fun of their hard work.

Representative image

MYSURU: After some students and research scholars were booked for sedition along with alumni of University of Mysore , varsity authorities have decided to throw out illegal occupants from its hostels.

Hundreds of students stay in PG blocks on campus and though they’re single occupancy rooms, more than two or three people stay in most rooms, claims syndicate member EC Ningaraja Gowda.

He added that since there’s no strict vigil on hostels, outsiders take advantage of the situation and stay there. “I have information that some rooms are being rented out and alumni are allowed to stay there. This is not good for an institution like University of Mysore that has a long cherished history,” he said.

The recent incident wherein varsity alumni, research scholars and students were named in a sedition case has badly dented its image, he said.

The syndicate has resolved to hold dean and hostel wardens responsible for any misuse of varsity property, especially hostels, hereafter and have suggested a round-the-clock vigil, he added.

There are three PG blocks each for men and women on the varsity campus.

A reality check by TOI revealed that since there’s no restrictions on entry, anyone can enter hostel blocks and stay inside in rooms. In women’s block, there is round-the-clock vigil. An employee said there are three blocks for girl students and entry is restricted. Every block is manned by a security guard. “Since the guard has gone for lunch, I’ve been at the gate. We know our inmates and don’t allow outsider inside,” she said.

R Shivappa, registrar, said a committee including syndicate members has been appointed to check the hostels. “Once the committee submits its report, we’ll take legal action as per university and hostel rules if there are any illegal occupants,” he said.

He added that there are allegations about hostel management. “Let the committee give its report and based on it, we’ll proceed,” he said. According to him, there are 18 hostels, including working women’s hostel, in Mysuru, Mandya, Hassan and Chamarajanagara, with 4,100 residents.

Real achievement will be when people adopt organic farming techniques

Preeti Biswas

Secunderabad: My real achievement would be when people start using my organic farming techniques at large and adopt healthy eating as a way of life, said Chintala Venkat Reddy, who was conferred with Padma Shri on January 25.

He was one among three people from Telangana to have received the prestigious award. Born in Alwal, Hyderabad in an agriculture family, he always had keen interest in agriculture. His invention that improves soil fertility also attracted the Presidents of the United States of America, Bill Clinton in 2001 and George W Bush in 2006 during their visit to Hyderabad.

“I don’t use any fertilizer, insecticides or fungicides for agriculture. Every soil has natural nutrients that can be utilised for farming. My mantra is to rejuvenate top layer of soil to reduce depletion of nutrients,” said Reddy.

For Reddy, Padma Shri is only a recognition that will help him spread the word about the novel techniques that he has developed in agriculture. Although his techniques have received patents from many countries in Europe, South Africa, Australia to name a few, he wants them to be widely and freely used by growers and cultivators.

“There is very little research into organic farming or agriculture field. Even if there are any, they fail to reach the masses. Purpose of developing new techniques is not to secure patents but to spread them widely,” said Reddy.

Now an expert into grape farming, he replicated the soil fertility technology in rice, wheat and black grapes which lead to high yields and high nutritive value. He was awarded with Uttam Rythu Puraskar award by former chief minister of Andhra Pradesh YS Rajashekar Reddy in January, 2006 and a national award at India-Agri Award in New Delhi in February 2012.

It’s the biggest recognition for me, says puppeteer Chalapathi Rao

Sandeep Raghavan

Tirupati: Puppeteer Dalavai Chalapathi Rao is mighty elated after being selected for the Padma Shri. “This is the biggest recognition I could ever get for dedicating my life for keeping alive the folk art form, which is fading away in the modern age,” Chalapathi Rao told TOI as he received neighbours and friends congratulating him.

Born in 1936 at the sleepy village of Nimmalakunta near Dharmavaram in Anantapur district, Chalapathi Rao was attracted to puppet shows quite early. He learnt the art from his father Khade Rao at an early age of 13.

And for the next five decades, Chalapathi Rao along with his group of eight artistes gave several puppet shows, mostly revolving around mythological themes. Some of his most popular performances are from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.

Chalapathi Rao and his troupe also rendered performances in the USA, Germany and France more than 65 times. As years passed by, Chalapathi Rao turned a teacher and inspiration for the youngsters at his village who took up puppet shows as their source of livelihood.

Of late, Chalapathi Rao along with his family members began training craftsman in making leather paintings, lamp shades, room partitions etc, as the art form began slowly fading away.

Chalapathi Rao, 84, said this is the biggest prize of his life. ‘‘I won a national award in 1988 and several other awards later. But nothing can be compared to being conferred a Padma Shri”, he said.

Celebrations erupted all around at Dharmavaram and Nimmalakunta where people queued up to congratulate Chalapathi Rao.

Five-decade passion for acting, Gopala Rao finally gets Padma Shri

J Umamaheswara Rao

Visakhapatnam: After five decades on stage and more than 5,600 theatre appearances, Yadla Gopala Rao, who became a household name for his acting prowess in Srikakulam district, has finally been recognised for his yeoman services to Telugu theatre when the Union government announced Padma Shri to him on Saturday.

Starting his theatre career as an adolescent, he had donned many a role in both mythological and social dramas. But Rao found his forte in enacting the roles of mythological heroes such as Lord Krishna, Lord Rama and Sage Narada.

His ‘Nakshatraka’ role in ‘Satya Harishchandra’ play stands out among all others.

Gopala Rao has been a recipient of several state and regional awards and is extremely popular on YouTube through his acting videos. Known for his skills in classical poem recital, he even donned the role of a movie producer when he made a movie of the lyrical play, “Satya Harishchandra,” in its original form. The movie, released in 2013, received much critical acclaim.

Speaking to ToI, the 70-year-old noted theatre personality said that he is happy to get the award at a time when the mythological plays have been witnessing a declining interest among the public.

“I derived true pleasure in stage plays for the last five decades and contributed my bit to the arts. My efforts and contributions to the theatre have finally paid off through the award,” said Rao.

Rao was born in Mandarada village in Santakaviti Mandal in 1950 and completed his PUC (pre-university course) in the Government College, Srikakulam in 1964. He made his stage debut as early as in 1964 when he was 14 in a social drama named ‘Desam Kosam’ (for the country). He earned a huge fan base not only in Andhra Pradesh, but also in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Odisha, etc. through his theatre performances.

All that I know, I learnt from my mother

Karimnagar: Litterateur and Sanskrit scholar Vijayasarathi Sribhashyam described the Padma Shri award as rare recognition for Sanskrit literature and language.

“My mother Gopamamba is my mentor and teacher. All that I know about Sanskrit, I learnt from her,” Vijayasarathi said. Vijayasarathi’s wife Hemalatha and son Varaprasad are elated over the recognition.

Vijayasarthi who was born in Chegurthi village in Karimnagar had his primary education in Urdu medium. His interest in Sanksrit propelled him to learn the language and Vijayasarathi took to composing Sanskrit poetry at the age of eight. He went on to author over a 100 books. He pioneered the use of several new genres and modes of expression in Sanskrit. He introduced ‘seesam’, a telugu indigenous poetic form, and was also the first one to introduce epistolary form in Sanskrit literature. His work Mandakini shot him to fame and won him laurels in India and abroad. Vijayasarath also has the distinction of using the maximum number of ‘dhatus’ in his poems.

In the year 2017, chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao had honored him with the Sanskrit Scholar award on the eve of Independence Day at Golconda fort, the family recalls with pride. Several literary scholars and fans of Vijayasarathis work expresses joy over the award being presented to the scholar.

The TTD may be selling demonetised and out of circulation coins to Steel Authority of India Limited based on their intrinsic value, while the numismatic value of these coins is several dozen times higher. Some of the coins are rare and command a price of thousands of rupees in the world numismatic market.

Coin experts suggest that the TTD segregate the coins based on their antique or numismatic value and dispose of the others. TTD, which is a quasi-government body, cannot sell demonetised and out of circulation coins at a price higher than their face value, though the coins command a higher price in the numismatic market.

A group of numismatists from the South Indian Numismatic Society led by its vice-president D Raja Reddy were engaged by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams to advice it on sorting out the coins. The group spent nearly six months at TTD treasury and Parakamani wing at Tirupati. What had astonished the group was the hundi at Tirumala was receiving gold coins minted as early as 1st century CE even in the 21st century.

The group had advised the temple administration to preserve coins minted before 1947 as they carry historical significance while other voluminous coins minted after 1950s could be disposed of as per government procedures.

Books written by Raja Reddy and Narasimha Murthy titled ‘‘Gold coins in the Srivari Hundi of Lord Venkateswara” and ‘‘Silver, copper and other metal coins in the Srivari Hundi of Lord Venkateswara” were published by the TTD in 2012, copies of which were presented to Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi during his pilgrimage to the Tirumala temple in June, 2019.

These books brought out by the TTD have a detailed historical and numismatic information on 1,213 gold coins and 1,382 coins made of silver, copper and other metals, with some even dating back to the Roman period.

Raja Reddy said the temple administration was already sitting on a coins pile up of over 20 tonnes of demonetised coins around 2012. ‘‘We asked TTD to preserve coins before Indian independence and to dispose of coins minted after 1947 following due governmental procedures” , he added.

Raja Reddy pointed out that a number of coin collectors and traders were selling these demonetized coins online and offline at exorbitant prices.

‘’Some traders are selling 25 paise Indian coins anywhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 25,000 per piece in the open market and online. But TTD being a quasi government institute cannot adopt similar means to dispose of the demonetized coins. TTD is trying to dispose of its demonetised coins through SAIL by following the guidelines laid down by the Reserve Bank of India and the security printing and minting corporation of India limited (SPMCIL) is the right way of disposal of the out of circulation coins’‘, said Raja Reddy.

AMARAVATI: As the government is set to pass a resolution to abolish the legislative council, TDP has decided to boycott the assembly session on Monday.

TDP has only 21 MLAs in the 175-member assembly. The party wants to stay away from the session to show that the resolution to abolish the council was taken in the absence of the opposition.

The decision to stay away from the crucial session was taken at TDP legislature party meeting held in the party state office here on Sunday. Led by opposition leader Chandrababu Naidu , the meeting discussed the strategy to take on the government.

Curiously, at least six MLCs stayed away from the session which was convened to keep the folk together. Although all those abstained from the meeting had conveyed their inability to attend the session on personal and health grounds, it triggered panic in opposition circles in the wake of YSRC’s alleged attempts to poach some of the MLCs ahead of the Monday’s session.

Sources said MLCs Satrucharla Vijayaramaraju, KE Prabhakar, Gali Saraswathi, Tippe Swamy, AS Ramakrishna, Dokka Manikyavaraprasad abstained from the meeting.

While Manikyavaprasad had sent his resignation letter Naidu, Vijayaramaraju cited health grounds for his absence. Saraswathi could not attend as it was her husband and former minister Gali Muddukrishnama Naidu’s death anniversary. KE Prabhakar said he could not attend the meeting as he had to attend a ceremony in the family. Similarly, Tippe Swamy had a wedding in the family to attend. Dr AS Ramakrishna is in the US. As many as 23 MLCs of the total 32 attended the Sunday’s meeting.

While Pothula Sunitha, Sivanatha Reddy have parted ways with TDP, Samanthakamani could not reach party office due to delay in journey. She had also not attended Wednesday’s council session.

Absence of the MLCs is not going to play a big role in the current situation unless the government decides to reconvene the council which was indefinitely adjourned by the chairman on Wednesday.

Speaking to media after the TDLP meeting, MLC Bachula Arjunudu said the party has decided not to attend the session as there was no provision to discuss developments in the council in the assembly.

“YSRC is going ahead with unilateral decisions. They are going to move the resolution to abolish the council after failing to woo us,” said Arjunudu. He said there was no point in attending the session where there was no respect for the opposition.

TDP office staff displayed some visuals from films-Mohammed Bin Tughlaq and 23 Raaju Pulakesi at the TDLP meeting to show how the erstwhile kings ruined their empires with anti-people decisions.

CM YS Jaganmohan Reddy

VIJAYAWADA: All eyes are on Monday’s cabinet meeting and the subsequent assembly session, where a decision on abolishing the legislative council is likely to be the main agenda.

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy gave enough indications in the assembly on Thursday on abolishing it, after council chairman MA Shariff referred the capital decentralization and CRDA repeal bills to the select committee. Jagan, during his speech, had said that there is no need to continue the legislative council if it fails to follow the constitution and functions with political motives, dropping enough indications that he would make a move to abolish the council. Interestingly, a draft resolution for the same was reportedly kept ready even before the special assembly session commenced on January 20.

While the legislative council was adjourned sine die on Thursday, the assembly too was adjourned to meet again on Monday. The chief minister has also called for a cabinet meeting before the commencement of the session after the weekend break. There is every chance that the resolution to abolish the council might be put up during Monday’s assembly session.

Meanwhile, talks are reportedly being held among the MLCs to save the council from dissolution threat. Some MLCs are holding consultations to bring in a split in the TDP ranks and stay neutral to avoid conflict with the government. More than a dozen MLCs have their term ending in June 2021 and an equal number in March 2022, besides a few whose terms end in 2023-24.

A TDP MLC, Pothula Suneetha, has already crossed the fence and met the chief minister. Sources said there are at least a dozen MLCs from the TDP who are ready to differ with the party leadership and stay as a separate group. The BJP and the Progressive Democratic Front members have already hinted at staying away from voting on the government bills, thus giving an edge to the ruling party. If all these efforts succeed, the government may differ on tabling the bill to repeal the council.

Representative image

CHENNAI: With the help of an employee from the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission ( TNPSC ) scamsters manipulated answers scripts of 52 candidates who appeared for Group IV exam in a moving vehicle on the intervening night of September 1 and 2, the CBCID said in a release on Sunday.

Two more people including TNPSC employee H Omkanthan were arrested on Sunday, taking the total people arrested in the scam to nine since probe began on Friday.

Omkanthan came in contact with broker Jayakumar of Mogappair through an agent named Palani last year, a release from the CBCID said. After striking a deal, Jayakumar had asked Omkanthan to select Keelakarai and Rameswaram examination centres for exam duty, the release said. Jayakumar reached the place a day earlier, and after collecting cash from the candidates, he gave them the special pens with vanishing ink to write the exam with.

Jayakumar followed the van ferrying answer scripts to Chennai, for which Omkanthan was one of the escorts, in a car. When the van was stopped around 10.30pm for dinner near Sivaganga, Omkanthan took Manickavel (other escort), the van’s driver and a policeman guarding the vehicle to a restaurant on the other side of the road after parking the vehicle.

Omkanthan sat others in the restaurant and handed over the keys to the answer sheets locker to Jayakumar. Jayakumar opened the van, took the bundles out and made changes in the car all night while following the van. The answer sheets were put back in place when the van was stopped for tea near Vikravandi around 5.30am.

Police said the main suspect, Jayakumar, is still absconding, and police teams are searching for him.

CHENNAI: After the busting of a major scam in the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission’s Group IV exam, many candidates said such malpractices have been going on for years and demanded that earlier exams conducted by the commission be investigated.On Friday, TNPSC suspended 99 candidates for life for resorting to malpractices in the Group IV exam held on September 1, 2019, after finding that answer sheets of 52 candidates who appeared from Rameswaram and Keelakarai centres in Ramanathapuram district were shaded after the exam. Agents supplied candidates pens with special ink which would disappear after a few hours to enable them to shade correct responses in OMR sheets later. Of 52 candidates, 39 ranked within the top 100.In the 2017 Group II-A exam, some candidates alleged, the topper answered 191 of 200 questions correctly and got 286.5 out of 300 marks, appearing from a centre in Ramanathapuram district. A few other toppers also wrote from Rameswaram and Keelakarai, they alleged.Karthikeyan, who has been preparing for competitive exams for last three years, said such malpractices prevented genuine candidates from getting jobs. “I narrowly missed appointment as the candidates with same marks got preference. I am a post-graduate and I cannot make any more attempts to enter government service...,” he said.Radian IAS Academy founder R Rajaboopathy said the scam was busted because the agents tried to be too smart. “Nearly 40 toppers from just two centres is impossible. Had they guessed the cut-off marks and given just above the cut-off marks the scam would have gone unnoticed,” he said.He said scamsters were targeting recruitment based only on exams like Group IV and Group II-A. “By introducing multiple stage exams and strengthening security at exam centres, such scams can be prevented.”U Sivabalan, academic head (TNPSC exams), Shankar IAS Academy , said many previous exams could have also been manipulated. “TNPSC should release names of the 99 candidates and should probe previous exams for malpractices. The racket could have influenced even Group I, Group II exams (multiple stage exams). It should consider moving from OMR sheets to online tests to prevent scams.”",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73649596,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-116487,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tnpsc-aspirants-want-previous-exams-probed/articleshow/73645042.cms

Tens of thousands of anti-CAA protesters assembled at Shaheen Bagh from midnight for a daylong celebration of ... Read More

NEW DELHI: While the Republic Day parade was on at Rajpath on Sunday morning, a different sort of celebration of the Republic was underway at Shaheen Bagh . Tens of thousands gathered at the now well-known protest site in southeast Delhi, where a trio of “Shaheen Bagh dadis” (grandmoms) unfurled the tricolour.

The organisers said the trio was accompanied by the mothers of former Hyderabad Central University scholar Rohith Vemula (Radhika) and missing JNU student Najeeb (Fatima Nafees), who unfurled the national flag together to a rapturous applause, followed by songs of celebration and patriotism which continued through the day.

Locals in the area, who have been at the forefront of the protest considered the heart of Delhi’s dissent against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), claimed that over a lakh people came from across the city and outside to celebrate India’s Constitution on Sunday. The site resembled a sea of orange, white and green as the protesters waved the tricolour while fresh paintings, graffiti and street art around the national flag came up at the site.

Around 10 pm, actress Swara Bhasker visited the protest site and hit out at the central government for creating a negative image about the women protesting there. Also present were former JNU student Umar Khalid and Vadgam assembly constituency (in Gujarat) MLA Jignesh Mevani.

“Jahan dekho, tiranga lehra raha hai. Jahan dekho, India likha hai. Shaheen Bagh ke dil mein India hai. Pure desh ko dikh raha hai, aapko nahi dikh raha? (Wherever you see, there’s a tricolour waving. Wherever you look, there is India written. India is in Shaheen Bagh’s heart. The whole country can see that, so why can’t you?” said Bhasker, addressing the crowd in the evening.

Republic Day celebrations at Shaheen Bagh had begun at midnight itself, when thousands gathered for a mass reading of the preamble . This was followed by performances by artistes, street play troupes and music groups which continued late into the night. The tricolour was unfurled around 11am. While the Shahaan Bagh protest has been going on for over a month now, the organisers described Sunday as the most important day of the protest.

“We’ve tried to send a loud and clear message to the government that the Constitution is above all and on a day when it came into effect, what better way to celebrate the Constitution than to oppose CAA and NRC?” asked Irfan Ansari, a Shaheen Bagh local. Sporting an anti-CAA and NRC cap, Ansari said that just like the government which is adamant on not taking the back the Act, people of Shaheen Bagh will also continue to “respect” the ideals of the Constitution.

“This is not a communal issue, but it is far bigger than that. We will not tolerate divisive politics and over 1 lakh people came here this morning. This is a sign of unity and that everyone is willing to fight for each other,” said Ansari.

Naeemuddin, another local present at the site said the occasion, which is a reason to celebrate the Constitution and the fact that it was a public holiday attracted people from all parts of the city.

“There were at least 1-1.5 lakh people in the morning alone and celebrations continued till late at night. People are singing songs, carrying banners or simply coming here to stand in solidarity with each other,” said Naeemuddin.

Shahid Hussain, who came to Shaheen Bagh from Usmanpur said the occasion felt like a celebration and not a protest, which has been the objective of the people. “A lot of misinformation is being spread that people here are being paid to come here or that this protest is about a particular community. People from all across the city are coming here and we are seeing all religions and communities represented. The fight is to save our constitution and the rights of every Indian,” said Hussain.

The protesters also asserted that attempts being made to politicise the Shaheen Bagh agitation were likely to fail. On Saturday, Union home minister Amit Shah had asked people to “press the lotus button (during voting in Delhi assembly polls) so hard it makes the Shaheen Bagh protesters run away on the very evening of February 8”.

“The attempts to gain political mileage from the protests are wrong and people are not deterred by such accusations. Those who come to Shaheen Bagh know the ground reality and these numbers will only continue to grow,” said Ejaj.

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy

AMARAVATI: Condemning speculation about horse trading , Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, advisor to chief minister, said YSRC does not need to poach MLAs from TDP. He said chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy will neither encourage nor indulge in unethical practices. He said that TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu was a malicious campaign on the issue as he is worried about the fate of his son once the council is dissolved.

Speaking to media here on Sunday, Sajjala said about 17 TDP MLAs were in touch with them and ready to switch sides. He said they could not do so as the chief minister was against such practices. “If MLAs are so eager, shall we need to tell about the anxiety of MLCs. However, we are not ready to take anyone into party for the sake of politics,” said Sajjala.

He said the assembly was adjourned for three days only to allow the people to debate the issue of TDP members’ attitude in the legislative council. He said TDP misused the council to stall the bills. He said that stalling the bills in the council by any means was nothing but acting against the mandate given by the people as the government had secured 86% of the seats in the assembly.

“TDP chief stooped so low by influencing the council chairman by sitting in the gallery. How long could they stop the bills with such practice?” asked Sajjala. He dismissed TDP’s claims about Naidu having a telephonic conversation with Union home minister Amit Shah to stall the abolition of the legislative council.

“Naidu criticised both Shah and prime minister Narendra Modi with vulgar language in the past. Naidu is just trying to fool his MLCs from parting ways,” said Sajjala.

Municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayana said the assembly would take a final call on the dissolution of the council on Monday. He said that the CM is of the view that people would decide whether the council had to be abolished. He wondered that vernacular media, which supported the council abolishment when NTR took the call, is spewing venom on Jagan for the same decision. “It is evident that council chairman has violated the rules and sent the bill to select committee. We are not influencing the MLCs and seeking their support,” said Botcha.

COIMBATORE: The University Grants Commission (UGC)’s ‘ Consortium of Academic and Research Ethics (Care)’ has so far added around 1,000 Indian academic journals to its list since it was formed last November, and the list is growing, said Bhushan Patwardhan, vice-chairman of UGC. He said the UGC was seeking to add more ‘credible Indian journals’ to its list under Care.

Patwardhan, who was in the city recently, said Care has stakeholders from across fields such as statutory bodies, academies and councils to review the journals every quarter.

Last November, the UGC had formed Care to ‘prepare a list of credible quality journals’ in the fields of social sciences, humanities, languages, arts, culture, Indian knowledge systems etc. The move came after bogus journals, predatory and paid academic journals started mushrooming across the country.

“Studies showed that 88% of journals in the UGC approved list were dubious. India has earned a very bad reputation because of this in the past 15 years. So we wanted to create a credible database of reputed journals to stop the practice of pay and publish,” he said.

Pointing out that the consortium has bodies such as the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research , the Indian Council of Medical Research and the Indian Council of Social Science Research, he said the members together decide which journals are good to be included in the list.

He said the databases such as Scopus and Web of Science could not be followed blindly in the process, as there were many journals in Indian languages and Indian knowledge systems which cannot go into those databases. “For that we need to have system like Care,” he said.

TIRUPUR: Many farmers in the district who had supplied sugarcane to Amaravathi cooperative sugar mill last season are yet to receive the Centre’s share of the minimum support price.

The sugar mill at Krishna Nagar in Madathukulam crushed 1.28 lakh tonnes of sugarcane grown in Tirupur, Dindigul and Erode districts last season after it had halted production for the previous two seasons due to low yield of the crop.

“The MSP was fixed at Rs 2,750 per tonne. While the state government had paid its share of Rs 2,612.5, the centre is yet to disburse its share of Rs 137.5 to some farmers,” said A Bala Thandapani, district joint secretary of the Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam, which is affiliated to AIKS. The sugar mill had procured 75,000 tonnes of sugarcane from farmers in Tirupur district , he added.

“While the Centre had transferred the amount for around 50,000 tonnes of sugarcane that were crushed till July last through the direct transfer method, the remaining amount is yet to be disbursed,” he said, adding that farmers should get the money within two weeks once they supplied the crop.

He also urged the state government to ensure that the crusher in the sugar mill is in good condition as last season it needed to be stopped for 28 days due to poor maintenance. tnn

CHENNAI: Last year, the state government announced that it would increase the monthly pension for disabled people from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000 and provide motorised wheelchairs to those with severe locomotor disabilities . Neither of the promises has seen the light of the day.

Andal Kumaran, a 62-year-old Saidapet resident who has muscular dystrophy, is struggling to avail of both. Andal says the earlier pension of Rs 1,000 she continues to receive is insufficient. “The amount is not enough. I had also written to the disabled welfare department to provide me a wheelchair but no progress has been made so far,” she said. Same is the case with 82-year-old K S Sreenivasan of Guindy , who has not received either of the benefits.

The state had announced that it would increase the monthly disability allowance from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000, half of which will be given to a relative or caretaker of the person. However, the state has only made a list of 800 beneficiaries who can avail this assistance.

“When I went to the local authorities they turned me away saying my name is not on the list,” said Sreenivasan. “I have written to every authority concerned about my condition. I have also explained that I am in desperate need of the assistance. But they haven’t done anything so far.”

The state provides the monthly welfare assistance to nearly one lakh disabled people across the state through the department for welfare of the differently abled, but beneficiaries have on several occasions complained that they don’t receive it on time.

In 2017, the government said it would provide 1,000 motorised wheelchairs to those in need but less than 200 people have received it, and some of it were damaged. The Spinal Injured Persons Association had written to the department, requesting them to arrange service centres to repair the faulty wheelchairs. “In one instance, a beneficiary toppled and suffered multiple fractures and had to be admitted at CMC Vellore. We have received a number of complaints on (faulty) parts... We request you to set up service centres,” the letter read.

Officials from the department said they were waiting for fund sanctions from the government to provide more wheelchairs. “We have prepared a new list of beneficiaries and will be providing them the revised pension amount shortly,” said an official.

62,['27/01/2020'],Shaheen Bagh: CM &amp; Shah in bitter war,"This story is from January 27, 2020

New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal went on the offensive on the Shaheen Bagh issue on Monday, accusing BJP of deliberately not getting the road opened. Addressing a press conference, the chief minister said: “BJP does not want to get the road — closed due to the protest — opened . Holding press conferences will not lead to improvement in law and order in Delhi. Law and order can improve with efforts. We can teach you how to work. We know how to work and they only know how to hold press conferences and do dirty politics.”

Kejriwal seemed to have overcome his initial hesitation in discussion the issue, faced with BJP’s aggressive campaigning. He said the road, affected by the protest against Citizenship Amendment Act, will be opened on February 9, a day after polling is held for the assembly elections. The closure is causing huge inconvenience to commuters.

It was last week after deputy CM Manish Sisodia said on a TV channel that he stands with the Shaheen Bagh protesters that BJP began attacking him and Kejriwal. Party spokesperson Sambit Patra called AAP an anti-Hindu party while Hari Nagar candidate Tajinder Singh Bagga said BJP stands with India and AAP with Shaheen Bagh protesters.

Union home minister Amit Shah escalated the attack on Monday by daring Kejriwal to clear his stand on the Shaheen Bagh protests and explain whether he was in favour of the protesters.

Later, on Twitter, Kejriwal responded to Shah who had also sought his stand on JNU student Sharjeel Imam, who has been booked for his speeches. “Sharjeel talked about cutting off Assam from the country. This is serious. You are the home minister of the country. Your statement is low level of politics. It is your responsibility to get him arrested. Two days have passed since he made the remarks. Why are you not arresting him? What is your helplessness? Or do you have to do more dirtier politics?” Kejriwal asked on Twitter.

“I am disappointed with the dirty politics of BJP on the issue,” he said at the press conference. “The road is closed and it is causing inconvenience to a large number of people. School children and ambulances are facing obstruction. Travelling (through Kalindi Kunj) that usually took 30-40 minutes is taking two-and-a-half to three hours. “I can give it in writing that...the road will open on February 9.”

The chief minister said he had repeatedly observed that Constitution guarantees the right to protest to every citizen but it should not result in inconvenience to the common man. “Why is the BJP led central government, which is responsible for law and order, not solving this problem,” asked Kejriwal. He said that instead of holding a press conference, union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad should have visited Shaheen Bagh and talked to the protesters to get the road opened. He urged Shah and other BJP leaders to also visit Shaheen Bagh and do the job.

VIJAYAWADA: In a novel initiative, the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) is transforming walls and other spaces in the city through paintings to discourage urination in public places. The civic body, which had painted walls with a combined length of around 10 km in 2018, has now taken up the strategy to improve its ranking in Swachh Survekshan-2020. VMC authorities have roped in students of various educational institutions to assist with painting the walls.

A team of 10 students from the School of Planning and Architecture, Vijayawada has painted a wall along Gopala Reddy Road to prevent public urination. The painting portrays a sanitation worker sweeping the roads also marks the prominent places in the city in the background and aims to explain to residents the Swachh initiatives undertaken by the civic body.

The VMC, meanwhile, is monitoring the street art created by the students. Assistant city planner at the VMC, Avala Ajay Kumar said, “This is not the first time that the VMC is utilising the services of students. Hundreds of students voluntarily painted the walls on both sides of Bandar Road during the Krishna Pushkarams in 2016. They had also played a key role in making the city India’s cleanest big city in 2018. So, we have decided to work along with them in making the city clean and beautiful,” he said.

“We have started painting scenes and messages at walls and spots adjacent to garbage bins to check urination in public places, and have noticed a significant fall in the trend,” the city planner said, adding that students of various city colleges have given their consent to paint the walls.

The School of Planning and Architecture developed the conceptual paintings, Ajay Kumar said.

NEW DELHI: Not far from Shaheen Bagh , the epicentre of anti-CAA protests in Delhi, the streets of Jamia were buzzing with action. Thousands of students from Jamia Millia Islamia , DU and JNU came out on the roads late into the night on Saturday and stayed through Sunday to “celebrate the Constitution”.With poetry and songs, the protesters made their dissent heard. While traffic movement remained functional on one side of the road, the other carriageway was blocked, first by those painting fresh graffiti on the walls and, then, by the thousands who gathered to celebrate Republic Day .Just like at Shaheen Bagh, the students were joined by women and children as they waved the tricolour on the streets. Locals said the numbers swelled in the afternoon. A tricolour was hoisted in the area by Jamia Millia Students’ Association, which was followed by the singing of the national anthem and the anthem of Jamia Millia Islamia.“It’s all about being together and celebrating the idea of being Indian. This protest is not limited to the students alone, as residents from Jamia Nagar, Okhla and New Friends Colony are coming in huge numbers every day,” said Shoaib Choudhary, one such protester.Chowdhary said he stayed at the protest site till 4am on Sunday, only to come back after a few hours. “Just like me, several others decided to celebrate Republic Day out on the streets. This is an important day for everyone and for the movement against CAA and NRC. The new law is against the Constitution in many ways and one cannot enact it and celebrate the Constitution at the same time,” Chowdhary claimed.As the people enjoyed street performances and plays through the day, there were renditions of poetry and songs of “dissent” at Gulmohar Avenue in Jamia Nagar. A mix of musicians and poets, entertained the people as they spoke out against CAA and NRC.Mohammad Aurangzeb, an engineering student who had come from Patna to take part in the protests, said people were not losing hope. “I’ve been in Delhi for a few days now and I know these protesters are not going anywhere, judging by the sheer numbers. Republic Day is an even more special occasion, as it sends a clear message that the country is governed by the Constitution and we will not tolerate any attempt to break its secular fabric,” Aurangzeb said.In the evening, the streets also saw a number of candlelight and tiranga marches, covering Zakir Nagar, Jamia Nagar and Shaheen Bagh.Wasil, who recently graduated from Jamia Millia Islamia and is a resident of Okhla, claimed that people were smart and would vote only for development in the upcoming assembly polls despite efforts by some politicians to polarise opinion.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73651930,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-725308,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/near-jamia-a-poetic-celebration-of-constitution-through-the-night/articleshow/73644311.cms

Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad

HYDERABAD: Anticipating that he may stage a rally, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad was taken into preventive custody while he was on the way to a protest meeting at Mehdipatnam on Sunday evening. Azad was in the city to participate in protest meetings against CAA-NRC-NPR.

Hyderabad police brass said a large number of Azad’s followers gathered at a hotel, where he was camping. He was supposed to reach Crystal Garden, Mehdipatnam, where he was planning to participate in Republic Day celebrations organised by All India Dalit, Muslim, Adivasi Progressive Front. Police, who were already tailing him, took him into custody the moment he stepped out of the hotel near Nampally around 6.30pm.

“We had information that Azad and others were planning to take out a rally. Publicity was given widely on social media and also among organisers of the event that a rally will be taken out. Since police had not given any permission for the rally, Azad was taken into prevention custody,’’ a senior Hyderabad police officer told TOI. He was likely to be released later in the night, sources said.

Apart from Azad, other protesters, who were with him at the hotel and Crystal Garden, were also taken into custody. On learning that Azad was taken to the Habeeb Nagar police station, protesters started to gather outside the police station. Later, Azad was shifted to the Bolarum police station, while other protesters were sent to Goshamahal grounds.

Earlier, Azad participated in a protest programme on Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) campus at Abdullapurmet, which was organized to focus on student issues as well as Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

He reached the campus by 11.20am and took part in an interactive session, where the main focus was on sexual harassment at educational institutions and how it should be dealt, especially when there was little help from university administration and police.

“If the police and administration are not addressing sexual harassment cases, approach women and child welfare department,” Azad said, adding along with protest it was also important to bring external pressure to get justice. He was at TISS campus till 1.30pm.

Azad also took to Twitter and alleged that police personnel not only made female students sit at the station the whole night, but also mistreated them.

“Insulting our sisters will not be tolerated,” tweeted Azad from TISS campus demanding the Rachakonda police to reach the institute and explain why female students were treated badly and made to sit at the station.

He also accompanied the students along with his lawyer to Adibatla police station to find out the status about sexual harassment cases, eight of them filed by TISS students in the current academic year. He left the station around 3pm,

“Eighty-three students were at the police station the whole night yesterday to file a complaint against molesters. The FIR copy was given at 4pm today, that too after intervention of Azad,” said Shashank, a student of TISS, said.

Representative image

GUNTUR: President of the state wing of Round Table International (RTI) Umesh Kapadia said on Sunday the organisation has launched an initiative to build infrastructure in government schools in the state. Kapadia laid the foundation stone for the construction of toilets in the mandal parishad primary school in Gorantla. The project is being funded by Round Table Guntur (RTG-86).

Addressing students on the occasion, Kapadia said many young entrepreneurs and business leaders have joined the organised to serve society. “It is a way of giving back to society. It is heartening that many young business leaders are liberally spending on charity works from their pockets,” he said. Kapadia praised RTG-86 for extending financial support to key projects.

RTG-86 president Raavi Balakrishna said members of the organisation were keen to be part of the state government’s ‘Nadu-Nedu’ programme that was launched to revamp infrastructure in the public schools. The project, Balakrishna said, would help children from underprivileged sections, especially girls, attend schools. The organisation has also decided to organise sports meets for children in government schools, he said. He said they would also provide sports kits to talented players to enable them to participate at state and national-level meets.

Chairman of Ladies Circle, R Lakshmipraya , said they were encouraging members to play an active role in funding construction of toilets in government schools as female students suffered from the absence of clean washrooms. Washrooms with running water would also help bring down the dropout rate in government schools, she said.

Convener of RTG projects Lanka Kranti Sekhar said they were lining up more programmes to improve infrastructure in public schools.

TIRUPATI: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams ’ (TTD) coins conundrum is moving toward final resolution. It will be handing over the last batch of nearly 85 tonne of demonetised coins to Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) in Salem in the first week of February for melting, freeing its godown that’s fast running out of space to store coin bags.The richest temple administration in the country had disposed of nearly 90,000 bags of coins of various denominations in October 2018 and mopped up Rs 30 crore.Though coins of denomination of 25 paise and below were demonetised by the Reserve Bank of India in July 2011, devotees continued to offer large quantities of such coins.Nationalised banks, which TTD used to transact with, continued to accept the demonetised coins until February 2014. But later they stopped accepting them, leading to piling up of huge stocks.When TTD first tried to exchange the demonetised coins at face value with the RBI, the central bank advised the TTD to approach the Union finance ministry to get the issue resolved.Following several parleys, the government mint at Mumbai, advised the TTD to get its demonetised coins disposed of by melting them with the help of SAIL’s steel plant at Salem in Tamil Nadu.On June 26, 2018, the TTD trust board accorded approval to dispose of the entire stocks of demonetised Indian coins through SAIL.Meanwhile on April 18, 2019, the Union finance ministry accorded permission to TTD to melt these coins at an already negotiated price of Rs 29,972 per metric tonne. As per the agreement between TTD and SAIL, the payment to be made to TTD will be adjusted towards supplies made to TTD by SAIL.In the first phase 40 tonnes will be disposed of. The remaining stock will be melted in the second phase a week later.",vijayawada,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73653354,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-516666,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/coin-crisis-ttd-godown-to-be-free-85-tonne-coins-set-for-sail/articleshow/73644448.cms
70,['27/01/2020'],History lies abandoned as ruins atop Kondaveedu hill cry out for preservation,"This story is from January 27, 2020

Guntur: About an hour’s drive from Guntur town lies Kondaveedu Hills with the historic Kondaveedu Fort and several ruins of temples and other structures. Abandoned structures of historical significance dot the area, but there is almost no preservation of these.

One of the problems lies in entering the area, which is a protected Reserve Forest, without permission from the forest department. Nor has the archaeology department taken up any initiative to preserve the structures, citing hurdles by the forest department.

Researchers to the area said they have uncovered previously undiscovered structures but their history remains undocumented in the absence of proper investigation, exploration and preservation by the archaeology department. While tourists to the Fort area have increased following the laying of a ghat road in 2019, less attention has been paid to the historically significant structures in the area. “All of Kondaveedu hill zone is a treasure trove of heritage structures. We need to take some urgent measures to protect such structures by denotifying the hill from the rest of the Reserve Forest,” said Kalli Sivareddy, historian and convener of the Kondaveedu Development Society.

Sivareddy added that in recent expeditions, he came across a Siva temple near Rudrapada Sikharam, the highest peak among the hills in thearea. The Rudrapada Sikharam is also known as Adam Shafi hill, named after the Sufi saint Adam Shafi. Muslims in the area believe the spot is the dargah of the saint and renovated the tank here, and use the space to hold festivals.

Near the Bollurmora Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple on hill housing the Fort lies two abandoned wells. For several years now, residents of villages around Kondaveedu Fort have organised a ‘brahmotsavam’ every year on April 27, yet the wells were left to neglect. One of the wells is known as ‘kanyakala baavi’ while the other is ‘jaddigala baavi’. According to historians, locals believe that celestial beings bathed in one of the wells, and named it ‘kanyakala baavi’. Two ‘kanyaka’ structures were also found nearby.

Further into the forest and on the hilltop is an abandoned temple with a mandapam and 16 pillars arranged in two rows. Historians are unsure yet if the temple is a Shaivite or Vaishnavite structure. “Further study is required to ascertain the history of the temple. It is believed to be a ‘yogi vemana mandapam’,” said Sivareddy.

Studies also point to the existence of a small barrage that connects two hills in the area. “It is high time that the government writes to the Union ministry of environment and forests to denotify the area from the Reserve Forest and preserve the historical structures here,” said Sivareddy.

Former director of the archaeology department Emani Sivanareddy said Kondaveedu could become the biggest heritage attraction in the state if efforts are made to preserve it.

71,['27/01/2020'],‘Scandalous’ speech: DMK urges Tamil Nadu governor to act against minister,"This story is from January 27, 2020

K C Karuppannan

CHENNAI: The DMK has written to Tamil Nadu governor Banwarilal Purohit seeking to get state environment minister K C Karuppannan dropped from the cabinet for his controversial speech, insinuating that the state government won’t allocate adequate funds for local bodies won by DMK.

In the memorandum sent to the governor on Sunday, DMK treasurer S Durai Murugan accused Karuppannan of making a “scandalous, irresponsible and divisive” speech at a public meeting in Erode on January 23. “I call upon you to exercise your power and demand resignation of K C Karupannan, failing which dismiss him from the council of ministers for breach of oath of office,” Durai Murugan said in the memorandum.

Addressing the gathering at MGR birth anniversary celebrations in Erode, Karuppannan had chided the public for voting for DMK in the civic body elections. “You have voted for DMK in Sathyamangalam panchayat union. What development will be there if the panchayat union chairman is from DMK. Only if we (state government) allot funds, there will be development. How will they provide you basic amenities if we don’t allot funds?” he asked. “If there is a DMK chairman, we will not allot funds. We will sanction lesser funds. You have made a mistake by not voting for ‘two leaves’ (AIADMK symbol),” he said. Karuppannan then went on to list the contributions of the AIADMK government in terms of basic amenities in the area and said he was saddened by the fact that even the community which was staunchly backing AIADMK did not vote for it this time. “At least in future, think well and vote for ‘two leaves’,” he said.

Durai Murugan said the minster’s speech was a direct threat to the people, to put them in hardship by restricting access to public funds merely because they did not choose to elect candidates from AIADMK.

In a damage control exercise, Karupannan told reporters in Andhiyur later on Saturday that his speech was misunderstood. “What I intended to say was that the ruling party can provide better amenities if the civic body chiefs were also from the same party,” he said.

Sathyamangalam panchayat union chairman from DMK shot back saying that if the government allotted insufficient funds, he will still provide better amenities by getting funds from DMK legislators under MLA funds.

Representative image

MADURAI: Madras high court has sought response from the state government on a plea moved by a woman seeking compensation and action against nurses and the doctor for leaving behind a broken needle in her body after child birth at a primary health centre (PHC) in Ramanathapuram district .

Petitioner Ramya, 22, a resident of Uchipuli and wife of Karthikeyan, said she was admitted to the local PHC on November 19 where she gave birth to a girl child through normal delivery. However, she suffered from a minor complication named episiotomy (surgical incision through vaginal wall during child birth) due to which she was bleeding even after being shifted to the ward. She said a doctor was not present during the delivery and it was the nurses who handled the situation. When the doctor arrived, she inquired about the bleeding but neither the doctor not the nurses responded properly.

Since she was bleeding continuously, she was referred to the government hospital at Ramanathapuram where the doctors noticed a broken needle inside her body in the X-ray. That was when she understood that the nurses while stitching the incision after performing episiotomy, had left behind a broken needle inside her body negligently. She was referred to the government Rajaji hospital in Madurai the same day and the needle was removed after a surgery on November 21. She stated that even after getting discharged she suffered from severe pain and once again had to get admitted at Ramanathapuram government hospital. Due to the negligent act of the nurses and doctor of Uchipuli PHC, she was put to great hardship after her child birth.

Hearing her plea for compensation and also action against the nurses and doctor of Uchipuli PHC, Justice S S Sundar sought a response from the government and adjourned the case to further date for hearing.

Photo used for representational purpose only

VIJAYAWADA: The state government is planning to set up a mega solar power project with an installed capacity of 10,000 MW in order to meet the increasing demand for power and to supply free, uninterrupted power to the agricultural sector.

Addressing employees of the energy department after Republic Day celebrations here on Sunday, energy secretary Nagulapalli Srikant said that the project will ensure an abundant supply of power to the agricultural sector.

The energy secretary noted that the number of agricultural connections in the state now stand at 18.1 lakh after the recent addition of 25,000 connections. The department is planning to increase the number of connections by another 25,000 in the current fiscal.

Srikant further said that the government is working on various options to optimise its power purchase cost with a mix of power from thermal, hydel and renewable energy sources.

The objective, the energy secretary said, is to make power cost-effective and to contribute to industrial, agricultural and economic growth and improve the living standards of consumers.

Despite severe financial constraints, the state government has allocated Rs 7,779 crore as subsidy for agriculture and aquaculture, said Srikant. The government has also strengthened human resource in the power sector by appointing 7,000 linemen and 175 assistant engineers.

Power utilities in the state have also saved Rs 500 crore through power purchase under open market bidding and Rs 180 crore in coal supply tenders. Srikant further noted that stage-V of Vijayawada Thermal Power Station and stage-II of SDSTPS at Krishnapatnam will be commissioned in 2020, adding 1,600 MW capacity.

The state government is prioritising energy efficiency and energy conservation, he added.

The submission made before NGT stated that of the 9,035 trees now, 5,717 would be transplanted.

NEW DELHI: As many as 9,435 trees will have to be cut for the Dwarka Expressway project. Of these, 400 have already gone “missing”, a submission made by the principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF) to National Green Tribunal has revealed.

The report stated that an inspection carried out by the forest department staff revealed that at least 400 trees were buried under construction debris. A fine of Rs 2.4 crore was imposed on National Highways Authority of India, it added.

“Notices were issued to NHAI, its contractors and other agencies working adjacent to the site where the trees were found buried under the construction debris. After giving sufficient opportunities to all the parties concerned, the tree officer disposed of the matter with a direction to NHAI to pay Rs 2.4 crore for the missing trees,” the report stated.

To meet the compensatory plantation norms, PCCF Ishwar Singh said 90,350 saplings would have to be planted, for which 90.4 hectares of land had been identified. The report stated that 6.2 hectares at Aravalli Biodiversity Park, 5.5 hectares at Tughlakabad Biodiversity Park, 15 hectares along Yamuna floodplain and 63.6 hectares of land under DDA’s “green belt” had been identified. The entire 90.4 hectares of land belongs to DDA.

“This much area of the land bank submitted by NHAI is found suitable and sufficient to accommodate 90,350 saplings, fulfilling the criteria as mandated under the Delhi Presevation of Trees Act,” the report stated.

The submission made before the tribunal also stated that of the 9,035 trees now, 5,717 would be transplanted. Rules mandate at least 80% of the trees to be transplanted from the construction site. The agency concerned also needs to ensure that at least 80% of the trees transplanted survive the process after a year.

Schemes under Navaratnalu are geared towards this as is the village and ward secretariat system, which will fine-tune administration.

The Polavaram project will be completed by 2021, the governor said, and a 7.2 lakh-acre ayacut will be built across Krishna, Guntur and the Godavari districts.

The governor also spoke about the Disha Act, Amma Vodi scheme and village volunteers.

Bengaluru: With the suburban rail project delayed, a citizen group suggested ring rail services using the existing 46km track with 10 stations connecting four hubs: Bengaluru City, Byappanahalli , Yelahanka and Yeshwantpur .

Rajkumar Duggar, founder of Citizens for Citizens (C4C), said: “C4C has worked out a conceptual design to implement local trains along the existing ring rail which works as a stop-gap arrangement till the suburban train system begins functioning. It will take more than six years to implement a dedicated suburban rail system.”

He suggested deploying Demu/Memu trains since they can reverse easily and also attain high speed.” said Duggar.

Rail activist Sanjeev Dyamannavar said the service can be operated at lower frequencies but constraints like a single line between Byappanahalli-Channasandra, lack of automatic signalling system, change of platforms at KSR Bengaluru City station and the track problem between Yeswantpur and Lottegollahalli have to be resolved.

But Bengaluru divisional railway manager Ashok Kumar Verma said: “It’s not feasible to have a ring railway system in the city since it’s not designed for it. Further, like suburban rail, we will need to get approvals and it will take more or less the same time. Re-modelling of existing infrastructure will be more challenging.”

File photo used for representational purpose

BENGALURU: The education department plans to introduce karate training in government schools from the next academic year to help students learn self-defence techniques. As a first step, the department wants to introduce it in a few thousand schools to gauge its success before scaling it up.

The initiative was mooted after primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar received a call from Chikkamagaluru student Suchita during his monthly phone-in programme, Samvedana. She requested for self-defence classes “to help students like her feel safe”. The department intends to start classes at least in some schools, starting with ones in remote regions, in the upcoming academic year. The classes will be for both boys and girls.

However, the challenge before the department is how to fund recruitment of teachers. At its recent meeting with not-for-profits and corporates seeking public-private partnership in strengthening government schools, it put forward a proposal of Rs 6.4 crore to start karate classes in 4,000 schools. “We are yet to finalise the modalities for introducing the classes; we have to identify schools, teachers and class timings. We are also looking at various fund options for the programme,” said KG Jagadeesha, commissioner, department of public instruction.

The move is part of the safety measures the department is planning to extend to its schools. Installing CCTVs in all its 48,000 schools, which will cost Rs 242 crore, is the other proposal.

“Introducing karate is a great initiative. Apart from the fact that it will improve self-defence, karate will also boost students’ concentration and strength. Instead of restricting it to a 12-hour session (as was done for class 9 students till last year), the department should make it an annual programme and introduce it at a younger age,” said HC Sowbhagya, physical education teacher at Government Urdu High School , DJ Halli.

78,['27/01/2020'],Suffering from sleep apnea? Check fat in your tongue,"This story is from January 27, 2020

Representative image

BENGALURU: A 45-year-old man with acute sleep apnea recently had the lymphoid tissues at the base of his tongue removed at a private hospital in Bengaluru. Though he had trouble speaking for a couple of days, his speech gradually improved. What also got better was his sleep, with fewer symptoms of sleep apnea.

What has sleep got to do with the tongue? A lot. Not just the tongue, but several tissues of mouth cavity can affect sleep by blocking airways, resulting in obstructive sleep apnea. A sleep disorder, OSA causes not just snoring, but also repeatedly interrupts breathing which stops and restarts.

Recently, researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at University of Pennsylvania discovered that improvements in sleep apnea symptoms appear to be linked to reduction of fat in one unexpected body part, the tongue.

Bengaluru doctors say the study, recently published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, vindicates their treatment protocol for sleep-related issues.

Dr Shantanu Tandon, ENT, sleep apnea and endoscopic surgeon, Sakra World Hospital, said there are several factors in the neck area and mouth cavity that can lead to sleep apnea.

“Sleep endoscopy helps in dynamic evaluation and visual evaluation of the upper airway, where we see the severity, pattern, location of the collapse of the palate, tongue base and tonsils,” said Dr Tandon, who sees over 50-60 cases of sleep-related issues every month.

According to Dr Tandon, the base of the tongue becoming floppy and sagging because of accumulated muscle tissue is rare compared to obstruction to sleep caused by tonsils, palette as well as neck fat. “If the obstruction is caused by tongue muscle or a lymphoid tissue, it’s reduced by a procedure called ‘radio frequency associated tongue-base reduction’,” the doctor added.

Dr Vivek Anand Padegal, director, pulmonology, Fortis Hospital, says the study’s finding that the dimension of the tongue changes with sleep apnea is interesting. “However, when we screen patients with sleep apnea, we do check the upper airways. By reducing obesity, the severity of sleep apnea can be reduced. And tongue fat is one of the factors,” he said.

Dr Padegal said there are surgical options available to reduce tongue size, but that’s possible in case of less than 5% of patients. “Surgery to reduce muscle in tongue fat is considered for some patients, who have enlarged tongue and in some where the child has Down’s Syndrome with a fat tongue. Upper airway endoscopy helps in assessing what collapses inside the throat region,” he said.

Representative image

BENGALURU: Rooftops of 1.4 lakh buildings have the potential to generate 2,500MW of installed solar capacity, according to a Bescom survey using aerial light detection and ranging technology.

The survey was carried out across 1,176 sqkm in the city. Only 205MW capacity of SRTPV (solar rooftop photovoltaic) has been installed till July 2019 in the state, while Karnataka’s solar policy of 2014-21 set an ambitious target of 2,400MW for grid-connected solar rooftop projects.

Bescom will soon allow third-party investors to rent rooftops of domestic consumers and set up SRTPV systems under various business models.

On December 9, the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission issued an order, detailing four business models to be followed for third-party investment in setting up solar plants at consumers’ homes. A developer/investor can now install, own and operate solar plants on a domestic consumer’s rooftop and sell energy at retail supply tariffs fixed by KERC.

Bescom has proposed a capital expenditure of Rs 1,275 crore for installation of hybrid solar rooftop plants with storage, with a capacity of 1060MW.

“We are identifying a consultant who will prepare a robust request for proposal document for the project,” said Bescom MD MB Rajesh Gowda.

NEW DELHI: India’s cultural diversity and military prowess were on full display during the 71st Republic Day celebrations on Sunday: a blanket of thick fog that engulfed the city in the morning and tight security restrictions could not deter the enthusiastic crowd from gathering at Rajpath.Like every year, the armed forces took centre stage, parading an array of weapons and the state-of-the-art technology at their disposal. As many as 22 tableaux — 16 from states and union territories and the rest from various ministries and departments — took part in the parade. The day saw many firsts: Brazil president Jair Messias Bolsonaro, the chief guest, was received by Prime Minister Modi, sporting a free-flowing orange turban, at the ceremony itself. Bolsonaro, the third Brazilian head of state to grace a Republic Day parade, was accompanied by his Indian counterpart, Ram Nath Kovind. This was followed by the customary 21-gun salute and hoisting of the tricolour.Earlier, in another break from tradition, PM Modi — accompanied by newly-appointed chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and the three service chiefs, General M M Naravane, Admiral Karambir Singh and Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria, paid tributes to the country’s fallen soldiers at National War Memorial, instead of Amar Jawan Jyoti, ahead of the parade.Indigenously-developed battle tank T-90 Bhishma tank, infantry combat vehicle Ballway Machine Pikate, self-propelled K-9 Vajra gun and the Akash weapon system were the main attractions in the mechanised columns. Indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, which is under development at Kochi Shipyard, and the newly-inducted Chinook heavy lift and Apache choppers were the other major attractions.Captain Tania Sher Gill, an officer serving with Army’s Corps of Signals, led an all-male marching contingent during the 90-minute parade, drawing admiration from the audience. Sher Gill had recently made history by becoming the first woman parade adjutant to lead an all-men contingent during the Army Day function. Major Sheena Nayyar, the first Army officer in her family, led a contingent of the transportable satellite terminal. The satellite system provides fail-safe secure communication to the forces on the move. Women personnel were also part of the navy and air force marching contingents. At the end of the parade, an all-women team of CRPF showcased their daredevil skills on motorcycles.For the first time, a DRDO missile used during ‘Mission Shakti’ anti-satellite weapon test, which put India in the elite counter-space capability club, was shown during the parade.A 155mm “make-in-India” Dhanush gun, developed by Ordnance Factory Board, was also displayed for the first time during the parade. Initial clearance has been given for bulk production of the 155mm indigenous gun. A model of fourth-generation multirole fighter jet Rafale, which France will be delivering to India in phases as per the Rs 59,000-crore deal for 36 aircraft, was part of the parade. A “Saravatra Bridge” system, a five-metre short span bridge system and an air defence tactical control radar made their debut at the parade.In all, there were 16 marching contingents, six from Army and the rest from Navy, Air Force, Central Armed Police Forces, Delhi Police, National Cadet Corps and National Service Scheme. Apart from this, the 61st Cavalry in the uniform of the erstwhile Gwalior Lancers, the only active horse cavalry regiment in the world that was raised in 1953, took part.The flypast by IAF aircraft was unique this time as US-manufactured heavy-lift Chinook helicopters and deadliest attack helicopters Apaches, which were used in Iraq and Afghanistan war, made their debut. Both the imported helicopters, recently inducted into the IAF, flew in different formations over Rajpath.They were followed by Dornier aircraft, C-130J Super Hercules aircraft, an Airborne Early Warning and Control System aircraft and the “Globe” formation comprising three C-17 Globemasters, which left the viewers spellbound. Five Jaguar deep penetration strike aircraft and five upgraded MiG-29 air superiority fighters in “Arrowhead” formation displayed their aerial manoeuvres.

Madras high court

MADURAI: Madras high court has set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on a man who assaulted a police constable in Madurai in 1997, saying the trial court had not examined important witnesses.

The prosecution case is that constable Rathinamani of Teppakulam police received a phone call informing him that a person was being assaulted by seven others at Kuruvikaran Salai on March 28, 1997. When Rathinamani and an SI were searching for the accused in the southern and northern banks of Vaigai river, one of the accused, appellant Sikkandar, assaulted him using a sickle in which he sustained injuries.

Following the incident, the police registered a case against Sikkandar and he was arrested. The fast track court in Madurai convicted and sentenced him to undergo three years imprisonment under section 332 (voluntarily causes hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant) of IPC on June 30, 2009. Sikkandar moved HC Madurai bench the same year challenging the order.

On perusal of the submissions, Justice B Pugalendhi observed that the police constable was assaulted by a rowdy element and the complainant is the same police constable. “Even though the investigation was conducted in such a shabby manner, the trial was concluded even without examining the relevant witnesses for arrest and recovery as well as the doctor who provided treatment to the constable,” he said.

Though an SI accompanied the constable at the time of occurrence, the person was also not examined. Hence the judge noted that it was not safe to sustain the conviction and sentence and acquitted the appellant of the charges framed against him.

New Delhi: The Shaheen Bagh protest is emerging as a “textbook case of a few hundred people trying to suppress the silent majority”, Union minister of law Ravi Shankar Prasad alleged on Monday.

Prasad claimed that those trying to fragment India were getting shelter at the protest under the Tricolour. “It is offering a platform to ‘tukde tukde gang’ elements under the garb of opposition to Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). This protest is not just against CAA, it is against (PM Narendra) Modi,” he said at a press conference. “Innocent children are being tricked into threatening violence against the PM,” the BJP minister alleged.

“We want this issue to be raised prominently during the Delhi polls as to what kind of India and Delhi we want,” he emphasised. “Should Delhi have a place for those who raise ‘tukde tukde’ slogans or want to cut off Assam,” he said, referring to anti-CAA activist Sharjeel Imam who has been slapped with sedition charges for his alleged speeches.

Shaheen Bagh is not just a locality, but has become an “idea”, said Prasad. But CAA doesn’t deprive anyone of citizenship and each Muslim citizen will continue to live with full respect, he claimed.

“Lakhs of people are distressed because they cannot go to office, shops are shut and children can’t go to school due to the road blockade by protesters,” Prasad said.

86,['27/01/2020'],Army stocking up munitions for 40-day war,"Army is slowly stocking up ammunition for 40-day war.

NEW DELHI: The 13-lakh strong Army is now slowly but steadily building its ammunition stocks ranging from rockets and missiles to high-caliber tank and artillery shells to ensure it can comfortably fight a full-blown war for over 10 days, with the eventual aim to have adequate stockpiles in place to last 40 days.Defence ministry sources say all the different types of ammunition for the Army will be built up to “10(I) levels”, which mean adequate stocks to undertake 10 days of “intensive” full-spectrum fighting, by 2022-2023, as per the latest assessment.This, of course, does not mean the Army is not operationally ready for war as of now. “It is, especially on the western front. But ammunition reserves have to be built keeping both Pakistan and China in mind,” said a source.The “earlier huge deficiencies” in several types of “critical” ammunition have already been “substantially plugged”, with more supplies in the pipeline under the 24 contracts (19 with foreign arms companies) worth Rs 12,890 crore inked for the Army.“The next target will be to gradually achieve 40(I) levels after some major rationalisation because not all types of ammunition are needed in such large numbers. Holding large reserves is neither economically nor logistically feasible,” said the source.The MoD is also in the process of contracting the domestic private sector to manufacture with foreign collaboration eight different types of tank, artillery and infantry ammunition worth around Rs 1,700 crore per year for a decade from 2022-2023 onwards.Over the last several years, at least since 2012, TOI has repeatedly reported the Army was fast running out of ammunition, with tanks and air defence units, artillery batteries and infantry soldiers all facing the crunch under the hugely depleted war wastage reserves (WWR). Successive parliamentary and CAG reports have also underscored the critical operational deficiency.But it took the Uri terror attack in September 2016 for the government to swing into action and delegate financial powers to the Army, Navy and IAF for “emergency and critical 10(I) contracts” after finding that the armed forces simply did not have enough ammunition stocks for a prolonged full-fledged war.Since then, contracts worth over Rs 24,000 crore for ammunition, spares, engines and other reserves have been inked for the three Services. The Army, for instance, is getting Smerch rockets, Konkurs anti-tank guided missiles, 125mm APFSDS (armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot) ammunition for its T-90S and T-72 tanks and other ammunition under the 19 contracts inked mainly with Russian and some other foreign companies.The defence ministry is also working to improve the functioning and quality control of the 41 factories under the state-owned Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), which supplies around 90 of the total 163 types of ammunition used by the Army.This came after the Army sounded the alarm about the unacceptably high number of accidents taking place due to the defective quality of ammunition being supplied for tanks, artillery, air defence and other guns by the OFB as well as the huge slippages in supply, as was reported by TOI in May last year.Just last month, the CAG had again slammed the OFB for compromising operational military readiness by failing to meet “a significant quantity” of the Army’s requirements as well as supplying defective fuses leading to multiple accidents.The Army, on its part, wants accountability to be fixed on those responsible for faulty quality checks and defective ammunition, which are leading to frequent accidents during firings of 105mm Indian field guns, 105mm light field guns, 130mm MA1 medium guns, 40mm L-70 air defence guns as well as the main guns of the T-72, T-90 and Arjun main-battle tanks.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73647560,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-132728,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-stocking-up-munitions-for-40-day-war/articleshow/73647518.cms

Around 5pm, cops refused fresh entry to India Gate to allow people to move out peacefully

NEW DELHI: Republic Day celebrations stalled the capital on Sunday evening. According to an estimate, around 50,000 people gathered around India Gate , Delhi zoo and Hanuman temple at Kashmere Gate. As a preventive measure to stop more people from gathering at these locations, five Delhi Metro stations were shut for around two hours.

The footfall was several times more than what police had anticipated. The crowd started swelling by 3pm, with people flocking to the zoo or India Gate, which chocked traffic on Mathura Road. Policemen had to intermittently stop vehicle flow to allow pedestrians to cross the road.

There was a huge crowd at Connaught Place too, which lead to major traffic disruptions. “Five metro stations, including Khan Market, Pragati Maidan, Mandi House, Udyog Bhawan and Central Secretariat, were shut around 5pm after a large number of people started gathering at India Gate and to visit National War Memorial. Interchange facility was, however, available at Mandi House and Central Secretariat,” a senior police officer said.

It was disappointing for people who had come to India Gate as police refused fresh entry, thereby allowing people to move out peacefully. “The place will become chaotic if we allow more people to move in. We are trying to ensure no untoward incident takes place as the number of visitors is a lot more than usual,” a security officer posted at the war memorial said.

Traffic movement in the evening was affected as autorickshaws refused to travel near central Delhi. At Rajpath, on one side were people who had gathered to click selfies with the tricoloured India Gate, on the other side were enthusiastic people who wanted to see Rashtrapati Bhavan, North and South Block lit up.

Many visitors, who were denied entry to India Gate, could be seen arguing with police officers. The cops told them to enter from a different side where they were meted out the same treatment. “My friend had come to Delhi from Gwalior and we decided to take her to India Gate. But now they are saying we can’t go,” said Avika, a resident of Noida.

MADURAI: Madras high court has directed the Virudhunagar superintendent of police (SP) to file a counter in a plea moved by a DMK candidate seeking CBI or CB-CID inquiry in to a case, which was registered for violence during indirect election of Watrap panchayat union .

In his petition, S Kannan, a resident of Virudhunagar district , stated that he was fielded as a candidate for the post of chairman of Watrap panchayat union in the district. When the indirect election was conducted on January 11, he had secured seven votes and the candidate belonging to the AIADMK secured six votes.

He stated that since he secured more votes, the members of the ruling party created ruckus during the election. With the help of Srivilliputhur DSP Rajendran, the ruling party members entered the building where election was held and caused damages to the property.

They attempted to tear the ballot papers, but the returning officer took control of the ballot papers and kept them in his safe custody. Following the incident, the election was stopped, he stated.

Though the police officials knew the identity of those who were involved in the violence during the election, a case has been registered against unknown people. The DSP was primarily responsible for stopping the election. Action should be initiated against him, he stated..

Though he submitted a representation to the authorities concerned along with the video footage, no steps were taken in this regard.

Hence, the petitioner moved HC Madurai bench seeking CBI or CB-CID inquiry into the case, which was registered for violence reported during indirect election conducted for Watrap panchayat union.

When the case was heard on Friday, Justice A D Jagadish Chandira directed Virudhunagar SP to file a counter and adjourned the case to February 6 for further hearing.

MADURAI: The online aptitude test held for students of Class IX and Class X in all government schools across Tamil Nadu , including in Madurai , was marred by poor network server connectivity and technical issues on Friday.

“This was only an experiment. When lakhs of students are writing an exam, there is bound to be network server errors. This was just a trial so that in future we know what needs to be done,” said a district education department official.

The aptitude test, which tested the general knowledge of students, was held to get students comfortable with giving exams online so as to perform well in competitive entrance tests like Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test-Under Graduate (Neet) in the future.

“We made whatever arrangements possible to ensure that the online test was conducted without disruption because we wanted to motivate students. We held the test in batches because we had only a few computers. The students were given a login ID by which they had to sign in and complete the exam. It was a new experience for them,” said the principal of a government high school.

Both students and teachers hope that online tests will be conducted more frequently so that they too can match private schools in quality.

Republic Day parade in Delhi's Rajpath

NEW DELHI: The capital was on Sunday put under a multi-layered, ground-to-air security cover with thousands of armed personnel keeping a tight vigil. Visitors to Republic Day parade were not only put through an extra round of frisking but were also not allowed to carry any metallic object, including coins. The entry to the venue was delayed as the visitors were told to leave behind anything that could possibly be thrown at the VVIPs.

The security was reviewed after intelligence inputs were received that protesters, carrying anti-CAA messages, could attempt to enter the enclosures. Apart from conducting a deep search of “suspicious” visitors, the cops deployed for coordination duty didn’t allow people to stand up or walk towards the grille around Rajpath.

For the first time, Delhi Police launched its mobile police control room van that was stationed at Rajpath to ensure seamless communication with other agencies. Facial-recognition cameras were installed at all light poles along Rajpath to keep an eye on the visitors. Apart from an anti-drone alert, flying of paragliders, hot-air balloons and remotely piloted aircraft was prohibited.

A team of sharpshooters from National Security Guard, along with spotters, was positioned on all highrises around Rajpath. An additional 48 companies of paramilitary forces assisted the nearly 22,000-strong Delhi Police force. Two anti-terror and crime control vans — Parakram and Prakhar — was deployed along the parade route.

Apart from securing the main venue, adequate security and traffic arrangements for the “At Home” at Rashtrapati Bhavan were made.

Security was tightened around popular markets, malls and other crowded places, too. The borders were secured and close coordination maintained with police of neighbouring states. “Surprise checks were carried out by placing barricades at various places. India Gate and other places of tourist interests were kept secure in view of the visitors’ rush,” said Eish Singh, DCP (New Delhi).

Rajpath remained inaccessible to general traffic till 12 noon, till when the entry and exit gates of Central Secretariat, Udyog Bhawan, Patel Chowk and Lok Kalyan Marg metro stations were also closed, beginning from 8.45am. All arterial roads in Lutyens’ Delhi were access-controlled through colour stickers that were provided for vehicles and visitors. Over 2,000 traffic cops were deployed to keep vehicle flow under check.

Representative image

MADURAI: Madras high court has upheld the termination of service of a woman who was working as pharmacist in an ESI dispensary, saying the charges against her for submitting forged documents to avail of a loan have been proved beyond doubt.

Petitioner C Helen Rani was appointed as pharmacist at the ESI dispensary in 1978. She borrowed a sum of Rs 1 lakh from the Madurai District Medical Department Employees ’ Cooperative Thrift Society, Tirumangalam, in 2001. Since the petitioner could not repay the loan, the society attached her salary. When the loan was still outstanding, the petitioner applied for another loan in 2003 by submitting a no-dues certificate. However, the cooperative society found that forged documents were submitted and hence a police complaint was lodged against her. An inquiry found that Helen Rani had submitted a forged no-dues certificate to the society and consequently she was terminated from service.

The petitioner moved HC Madurai bench in 2013 seeking to quash the termination order and reinstate her. On perusal of submissions made by either side, Justice S S Sundar observed that the petitioner has fraudulently obtained a loan which was unbecoming of a government servant. She suppressed the existing loan through the forged certificate and produced a forged salary certificate by forging the signature of the officer of her establishment. “When the petitioner produced forged documents for the purpose of getting a sum of Rs 1lakh, she may not hesitate to accept bribe for doing anything against the interest of the department for the sake of her own benefit,” observed the judge. Rejecting the contention of the petitioner that there cannot be a parallel proceeding departmentally when the case was pending before the criminal court, the judge observed that she was found guilty of the charges by the criminal court though she was discharged on probation upon payment of the entire loan amount to the cooperative society.

Indian dogs are being adopted by many families in the US, Europe and Canada, and are considered among the best... Read More

HYDERABAD: Kittu, a two-year-old stray dog that was rescued from the streets of Hyderabad is now enjoying the white sand beaches of Jacksonville, the largest city in northeastern Florida.

Found unconscious in the middle of the road, Kittu was rescued and adopted by Ujwala Chintala, a US national who was on a trip to India in December 2019.

Speaking to TOI, Chintala said, ""I personally rescued Kittu while I was driving in Mansoorabad, Hyderabad. We found Kittu with a shattered leg and heavy mastitis. She was a mother dog when we found her, but her puppies were not to be found. They may not have survived"".

""After getting the treatment done, I decided to adopt Kittu and take him to Florida. Stray Dog Support Inc. generously helped to bring her to the US, while Poochies Pet Rescue, Inc. took a bold decision to take Kittu into their rescue. All for the welfare of this much-needed dog,"" said Chintala.

Like Kittu, several stray dogs in India, rescued by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Hyderabad and elsewhere in the country are now finding homes in the US, Europe and Canada. While a majority of Indians still fancy having pedigree breeds such as Labradors, Huskies, German Shepherds and St Bernards as pets, the Indian native dogs or the Indian Pariahs that are forced to survive in squalid conditions on our streets are being considered one of the best dog breeds abroad. In another instance, Monkey (now named Picabo), a paralysed pup who survived all kinds of harsh conditions on the streets a few months ago and Paavan whose face was consumed by a tumour are both winning hearts of their new families in Washington DC, US.

Posting a video of Picabo on a Facebook group (Stray Dog Support Inc.) dedicated to stray dogs, the NGO that arranged Picabo’s adoption and transfer to the US wrote, “Monkey (Picabo) our recent arrival from India is enjoying her first Christmas toy! This little girl is winning the hearts of her new adoptive family. We are so happy for this little paralyzed pup who survived the harsh streets.” While two other street survivors Posto and Chochori also have new homes in the US, Xena whose mother and three siblings died due to severe mange soon after the delivery has been adopted by a Canadian resident and is now living at Port Alberni, a city in Vancouver Island, Canada.

“Stray Dog Support is dedicated to save and improve the lives of defenceless and vulnerable street dogs around the world including India. We work to provide financial support to these local rescuers who often go without food and basic needs in order to help these at-risk dogs. We also help facilitate the transport of these street pups internationally,” said Helen Summerfield Brown of Stray Dog Support Inc.

In 2019, an NGO Peedu’s People sent 43 dogs to their forever homes in Canada, USA and UK . Out of 43 dogs this year, 21 were special needs (paralyzed, tripods, blind, deaf etc) and 39 were orphans. In four years, the NGO got a total of 117 Indian dogs adopted abroad. NGO volunteers who organize adoption and transfer of stray dogs to other countries said that they do all necessary background checks and review applications of the possible adopter when they approach them.

“The process of adoption is simple, and all the expenses are for transport and permissions are made by the adopters themselves,” informed Singh. The cost of transporting a dog from India to the US, Europe and Canada can be anywhere between Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh depending on the country.

“It usually costs less if the pet travels with the adopter or a foster who can handover the pet to the permanent owners after they reach the country in which it is getting adopted,” said Singh. “At the end of the day these desi dogs show the world how fantastic, smart, intelligent and loving they are. They are changing the perception of the Indian pariah dog, slowly but surely. More importantly they show us Indians that our dogs have value, that they should adopt and save a life than spend on expensive breeds,” said Inder Sandhu of Peedu’s People.

Telangana CM K Chandrashekhar Rao

HYDERABAD: Expressing dissatisfaction over cleanliness efforts being taken up under ‘Palle Pragathi’ programme, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said it has become a photo shoot event for some ministers, collectors and public representatives.

The CM said he would carry out surprise checks to review the ground situation. “Some ministers, collectors and public representatives are posing for photos for the media for publicity sake and claiming that they are cleaning the villages as part of Palle Pragathi programme . This is not correct. It is not their duty to sweep the villages, they only have to ensure that the work assigned is done properly,” KCR said during a review meeting on Palle Pragathi on Sunday.

“The required staff has been recruited in gram panchayats and their salaries have been increased. It is the responsibility of officials and public representatives to find out how the cleanliness works in the villages are going on? I will make surprise visits to the villages to review the ground situation,” the CM added.

He said the sanitation works should be done on a daily basis and village nurseries have been made compulsory for improving greenery in villages. With inspiration drawn from Palle Pragathi, Pattana (town progress) programme would also be launched shortly.

The CM also asked officials to take steps to ensure that Hyderabad and other cities don’t not turn into pollution ridden cities. “There is about 1.60 lakh hectares of forest land available inside and outside of Hyderabad. Grow trees in large numbers on these lands and transform them into dense forest. Ten per cent of the GHMC and HMDA budget funds should be utilised for increasing the green cover,” the chief minister said.

He asked the officials to prepare Haritha Haram plans for other cities and towns too by creating one nursery per ward. All the towns and cities in Telangana should be resplendent with greenery, he said.

FARIDABAD: Frustrated with the state machinery’s failure to fix potholes on Faridabad roads, Manoj Wadhwa, a telecom engineer, and a few friends took to filling up some potholes themselves on Sunday. Wadhwa knows better than others what irreparable loss and pain a crater on the road can cause since he lost his three-year-old son in a pothole-related road accident on the Delhi-Agra highway six years ago.Wadhwa spent time going through tutorials on how to fill potholes from two groups — Pothole Warriors in Mumbai and Pothole Raja in Bengaluru — before he reached the identified site with three bags of mixed bitumen and other necessary items. The team brushed the identified site to take out the dust and then poured the cold-mix to fill the potholes.Pothole Warriors and Pothole Raja have been carrying out several campaigns to fill potholes to highlight the inefficiency of municipal bodies and other road owning agencies.“We chose Sunday (Republic Day) to fill potholes with the hope that this will wake up government agencies. If a few of us can fill potholes, why can’t government agencies and contractors do this small thing despite having all resources at their disposal,” Wadhwa said.He said had there not been a pothole on the Delhi-Agra highway on February 10, 2014, he would not have lost his son Pavitra. “He would have been nine years now. Negligence of agencies ruined our happiness forever. I don’t want anyone else to go through this pain of losing a family member. Now, it’s mission of life and I don’t get disheartened even if I don’t get very encouraging support from others,” Wadhwa said.His fight against potholes started soon after he lost Pavitra and he has been fighting a long legal battle against National Highways Authority of India and a private construction firm to fix responsibility for the pothole that claimed his son.The accident took place when Wadhwa and his wife were returning from a marriage party. “Pavitra was sitting between me and my wife. I spotted a pool of water on the highway and applied brakes. As I lost balance, Pavitra fell on a sharp stone, which hit his chest. A vehicle coming from behind ran over my wife’s legs.

MADURAI: Marigolds have bloomed in plentiful at Chinnalapatti in Dindigul district , but their falling prices have disappointed farmers. Farmers have cultivated yellow and orange marigolds at Oothupatti, Kamalapuram, Perumalkovilpatti, Jathikoundapatti, Theppampatti, Nadupatti, Kathirpatti and Sempatti. It has also bloomed at Pachamalaiyankottai and Seevalsaragu in the district.

S Rajadurai, a farmer, said they had started the cultivation three months ago. The plants have developed well due to recent rains, and now they are in full bloom. Saplings were purchased at Siruvani in Coimbatore and Hosur. A single hybrid sapling costs about 1.80 and 15,000 saplings can be planted in one acre.

Farmers said that the flower had good demand this season as they are widely used in temples for decorations and in rituals. As this is also the wedding season, the flowers are in high demand. That’s why many farmers opted for marigolds, which has led to a glut in the market bringing down the prices, farmers said.

The red soil in Dindigul region adds colour to marigolds grown in this area, say farmers. It is cultivated twice a year by the farmers, once in June and then in October. “When conditions are conducive, like they are now, we get a good harvest of about 400 to 500 kilograms of flowers once a week from an acre,’’ said Saravanakumar, a farmer. Most of the flowers produced in this region are taken to the Dindigul and Nilakottai flower markets by the farmers. Last year farmers sold marigolds at 50 a kilogram, but this year they are getting only 20 a kilogram, leading to a loss.

“We have to pick these flowers as early as 3am and take them to the market by 7am when they are fresh. But this year’s price is very disappointing,’’ said Saravanakumar.

Raichur: The Anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) movement is gathering momentum in Raichur district too. The region which saw sporadic protests is now all set to sit for an indefinite dharana.

People under the banner of Citizens Forum for Constitutional Rights (CFCR) kick-started a day-and-night indefinite demonstration on Republic Day on Sunday. After hoisting the national flag, people began the agitation at the Tipu Garden in front of the deputy commissioner’s office.

Many organisations have come together to form this forum to launch the agitation. Raghavendra Kushtagi, one of the organisers, said, “The government’s clarifications on CAA are to fool the people and further the agenda of Hindutva by dividing nation on religious lines.”

Kushtagi said although government is urging the people not to view CAA in the prism of NRC, the government’ activities suggest clear link between these two. In Bengaluru and Madikeri verification of immigrants are being conducted. BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) has demolished houses of people. “People are not fools not to understand what is happening. In order to oppose this, indefinite protest is launched,” he said.

Khaja Aslam another protester said it has now become a duty to protect brotherhood and harmony among the people. The government is dividing people and planting communal hatred, he added.

R Manasayya, who is also spearheading the protest, said, “We are hoping that country’ apex court may rule in favour of people to protect the values of the Constitution. The protest will go on until CAA is taken back,” he said.

On day one, nearly 300 people gathered at the site and it is expected that everyday nearly 400-500 people will sit for dharna on rotation. In the night hours at least 50 people will sit at the place. Many cultural activities will be held at the place to spread communal harmony.

NEW DELHI: A group of auto-rickshaw drivers have moved Delhi high court challenging their prosecution by traffic police officers for sporting a political advertisement — “I love Kejriwal” — logo on their vehicles.

The petitioners claimed the challans slapped on them on this ground violated their fundamental right to free speech and they could not be penalised for “expressing their opinion in a permitted manner”.

The first petition by Rajesh, likely to be taken up for hearing on Tuesday, told the court that he was an auto driver and barely managed to make a living.

“The the petitioner had got painted words “I love kejriwal” and “Sirf kejriwal” on the back of his vehicle in September-October 2019, of his free will and without any coercion, allurement, inducement, monetary incentive or force from anyone,” Rajesh’s petition argued, blaming the traffic cops for unilaterally booking him.

As per the petitioner, without any prior warning or missive from any government department, earlier this month his vehicle was stopped near Apollo hospital by traffic cops and he was illegally challaned for permit violations under various provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, while also being slapped with a fine of Rs 10,000 on account of the symbols and markings on his auto.

The plea said that Rajesh was prosecuted for displaying an “advertisement of a political party” and violating the model code of conduct in force in the city due to the upcoming assembly elections.

A second petition seeking similar relief was filed by three other auto-rickshaw owners who were challaned by traffic cops “for painting a statement of adulation/admiration for a public figure on their vehicles”. Citing a 2018 high court order, the petitioners maintained that even if the symbols were seen as political advertisement, these were exempted from the Delhi Motor Vehicle Rules as per government’s statement in court then.

New Delhi: Delhi high court on Monday sought the response of the Centre and Jamia Millia Islamia on a plea challenging the appointment of the current vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar.

Justice AK Chawla issued a notice to Union ministry of human resource development, Central Vigilance Commission, University Grants Commission, Jamia and Akhtar seeking their stand on the petition by a lawyer, who is also an alumnus.

The plea by M Ehtesham-ul-Haque alleged that Akhtar’s appointment was invalid on the ground that the search committee mandated to select prospective candidates for the post was constituted illegally. It was also claimed that she was denied CVC clearance initially, which was subsequently revoked after the HRD ministry’s intervention.

“It is submitted that the entire process culminating into the impugned appointment of Najma Akhtar is a colourable exercise of power and in flagrant violation and total non-compliance of the statutory provisions of the Jamia Millia Islamia Act, 1988,” the plea further alleged, urging HC to declare her appointment as VC “illegal, arbitrary, void ab initio and non est in law”.

In his plea, Haque also argued that laws governing establishment and running of Jamia were “sacrosanct” and couldn’t be interfered with by any authority. “JMI Act and statutes are binding on the university and all its functionaries,” the plea underlined, assailing a central minister’s move to recommend a panel of names for the appointment in 2018.

Referring to the search committee set up by the Centre that finally zeroed in on Akhtar, the petition claimed that minutes of the proceedings of the panel showed “neither was academic excellence nor exposure to the higher education system or adequate experience in academic and administrative governance was considered by the committee”. This was despite the fact that the panel was required to record its satisfaction that the three nominees were persons of highest level of competence, integrity morals and institutional commitment, the plea added.

HYDERABAD: Fearing that power supply may get be snapped if they fail to recharge on time, 682 government schools , who have been provided with prepaid electric meters, in the city have submitted a request for converting these meters into post-paid ones.

The district education officer (DEO), Hyderabad said a representation has been submitted to the director of the school education (DSE) office to ensure that meters were converted into post-paid ones.

“Right now, there won’t be any problem as the budget to recharge meters in all government schools in the district has been released. So, there won’t be any problem till March 2020. However, we want the meters to be post-paid so as to ensure that there won’t be any problems even in the future,” DEO, Hyderabad, B Venkata Narasamma said.

She said the budget to clear electric bills is usually released in June. “With the post-paid meters , even if the bills are not paid for a couple of months, there will no disruption of power supply. But, with prepaid meters, we won’t have that option,” she added.

The officials said they had already orally requested Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL) for conversion of meters, but the request would be looked into after the DSE sends a written representation.

Teachers working in government schools too said that it would be better if meters were converted into post-paid ones.

“If the power supply is suddenly disrupted, especially during the examinations, it will be a problem for students. If the connections are post-paid, such a situation will not arise,” Chava Ravi of the United Teachers’ Federation said.

The teachers also said that when the electricity charges were paid after the bill gets generated, the entire amount would be cleared. However, with prepaid meters, the schools might have to explain why bill exceeded the recharge amount, in case they have to top-up in the middle of the month.

During 2018-19, the discom had installed 10,500 meters in district collectorates, government schools, police stations and electric crematoria in HMDA jurisdiction. Government departments were picked by the discoms to put an end to the issues arising out of bill arrears. While the government offices’ power bill works out to Rs 120 crore to Rs 130 crore a month, the discom gets only Rs 50 crore to Rs 60 crore a month.

NCC cadets march in perfect synchroinsation at the Republic Day celebration in Mangaluru on Sunday.

MANGALURU: District minister Kota Srinivas Poojari said, “Dakshina Kannada is facing multiple challenges on the law and order front. Despite this, the district administration has been successful in upholding peace and communal amity.

Mangaluru city police competently handled the bomb-scare incident at Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) and successfully addressed public concerns and fears that it generated.”

Unfurling the national tricolour at the district Republic Day celebrations on Sunday, Poojari, also minister for ports, fisheries and religious endowment, backed the steps taken by the city police in defusing the crisis that the IED scare generated.

“I recall with pride the role that Gangaiah (of BDDS) and other policemen played,” he said, adding the state and central governments are committed to ensuring that people of the district lead a peaceful life.

The minister’s backing of police action assumes significance in that former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy had described the entire incident as an elaborate ‘drill’ to defuse nothing more than a bag that contained ‘mini mini’ powder aka gunpowder. The city police brass, without getting into the political maelstrom their action generated, maintained that the abandoned backpack found at Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) on January 20 indeed had an IED in it.

On farmer’s welfare, Poojari said 1.3 lakh farmers in Dakshina Kannada have benefitted from the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, wherein they receive Rs 6,000 from the Centre and an additional Rs 4,000 from the state government.

The two governments have already released three instalments under this fund, aimed at recognising the contribution of farmers to food security of the nation, and the fourth instalment will be released shortly,” he said.

Likewise, 67,620 farmers have benefited to a tune of Rs 526.5 crore by way of the move by the government to waive up to Rs 1 lakh of short-term agriculture loan availed by them from cooperative institutions in the district. In all, 417 economically backward women from minority communities have received aid of Rs 2.1 crore for their marriage. The religious endowment department has started Sapthapadhi, a similar scheme in 100 endowment temples, he said.

The government has taken steps to construct a 300-bed medicine superspeciality block at Wenlock Hospital at a cost of Rs 28 crore. This block will house a 31-bed medical intensive care unit, the minister said, adding the country’s first integrated AYUSH Hospital that is being constructed at a cost of Rs 8 crore too will come on the district hospital campus.

These new facilities will give a fillip to healthcare in the government side, the minister noted.

Earlier, Poojari received a guard of honour from 18 marching contingents at an impressive parade.

NCC Air Wing senior cadets and their Army counterparts were adjudged the top two marching contingents. Students from various schools presented a vibrant cultural programme on the occasion. The administration honoured bureaucrats with Sarvothham awards and district Kannada Rajyotsava awards, for achievers in diverse fields, on the occasion.

The anti-CAA (Citizen Amendment Act) and anti-NRC (National Register of Citizens) march was organised by the UoH students union.

HYDERABAD: Telangana Congress president and Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy has termed chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's stand against CAA as “political drama.”

He read out the preamble of the Indian Constitution after unfurling the national flag at Gandhi Bhavan and said that CAA and NRC are against provisions of the Constitution. AICC had directed its state leaders to read out the preamble to create awareness among the people about CAA.

Responding to KCR's announcement that Telangana Assembly would pass an anti-CAA resolution, he said despite repeated demands by him for a special Assembly session on the issue, KCR remained silent all these days. “Immediately after poll results, KCR has begun a new drama. HE cannot be trusted as he keeps changing his stance,” he said.

New Delhi: The maximum and minimum temperatures rose by a few notches on Monday following drizzle in parts of the city owing to a western disturbance .

India meteorological department (IMD) has forecast a spell of light rain on Tuesday as well, with isolated parts of the capital receiving hail.

Delhi’s minimum temperature has gradually been rising over the last 48 hours. On Sunday, it was recorded at 6.9 degrees Celsius, and it rose to 8.5 degrees Celsius on Monday. It is likely to touch 11 degrees by Tuesday. “Both the maximum and the minimum have risen due to a western disturbance. Its withdrawal after 48 hours and the resulting rain will lead to a drop in temperatures once again. Parts of Delhi recorded very light rain on Monday, but the intensity will be higher on Tuesday,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD.

Delhi’s maximum temperature on Monday was recorded at 23 degrees Celsius– one degree above normal. Srivastava says the maximum is likely to fall to around 19 degrees on Tuesday due to overcast conditions.

Between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm, the Lodhi road and Ridge stations received ‘trace’ rainfall, while parts of west Delhi also received a drizzle. The relative humidity in the last 24 hours oscillated between 58 and 100 per cent.

Forecast for Tuesday shows light rain in the morning, accompanied by hailstorm in isolated pockets. Strong surface winds in the range of 20-25 km/hr are also likely to occur. Delhi’s air quality, meanwhile, was recorded in ‘very poor’ range with an air quality index of 345.

AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi

HYDERABAD: Condemning JNU student leader, Sharjeel Imam ’s controversial comment about Assam, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said that India is not chicken’s neck that it can be broken.

Speaking late on Saturday night, the Hyderabad MP expressed dissatisfaction over the comment and said, “No one can either break Bharat, or a region from it. This is a country, not a murgi’s neck. You should not resort to such talk.” Owaisi added, “Whoever is doing so, I don’t accept it and I condemn such wahiyad (nonsense) talk.”

In a video that went viral, Imam was heard saying, “If we want to help Assam, we should block the way for armed forces,” branding Assam as chicken’s neck. Assam Police as well as Aligarh Police have registered a case against Imam.

Meanwhile, Owaisi, on Republic Day, hoisted the National Flag at Madina Building Cross Road, (south zone) and read the Preamble. Owaisi wanted to hoist the national flag on the intervening night of January 25 and 26 at Charminar but police denied permission.

“If police allows, I will form a human chain on January 30,”said Owaisi. The chain will be formed as mark of protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register ( NPR ).

Nagpur: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s (RSS) Sarkaryavah (general secretary) Suresh (Bhaiyaji) Joshi said the Hindus of Sri Lanka are not facing any persecution problems like those in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Joshi is no. 2 in RSS hierarchy after Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat.

Talking to newspersons on the sidelines of a flag-hoisting function held at the RSS headquarters in Mahal locality of Nagpur, Joshi said the issue of allowing Tamil Hindus of Sri Lanka into the ambit of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was taken up in Tamil Nadu. ""However, it is seen that Hindus living in that country are not facing the kind of troubles like those in the three countries covered under CAA,"" he said.

Amid protests against CAA and NRC, political parties including Congress, have raised the question of not including the Sri Lankan Tamils into the law. As he took questions on the anti CAA-NRC protests, Joshi said there has been no discrimination against followers of Islam in India. ""Even Muslims have the chance to get Indian citizenship if they apply through the regular course. Every government has tried to come up with a similar law on citizenship. Why is there a hue and cry only this time,” asked Joshi.

“Republic Day should be a matter of pride for every Indian. After gaining Independence, the country is now run on the basis of constitution framed under the leadership of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. Now it is the duty of each of us to maintain the glory of the constitution,” he said.

Later, another flag hoisting event was held at the RSS campus in Reshimbagh. This was addressed by Suresh Hiremeth, a member of RSS’s national executive committee.

“Japan, which is counted among the developed nations, also has the toughest geographical conditions. In 2011 it was hit by a Tsunami. Tokyo city was not much impacted but nearly 50 lakh persons living in other places were displaced. The 1 crore residents of Tokyo opened their doors for 50 lakh of their fellow countrymen. Each home welcomed them as their own family members. Shops were thrown open and the affected could take things free if they had no money,” said Hiremeth, in a probable reference to the opposition to over granting citizenship to foreign nationals under CAA.

“A lot of misconception is being spread these days only for political gains. Every political party has the right to carry out activities with an aim to come to power, but not through unfair means of misleading the people,” added Hiremeth.

Excerpts of a letter written by RSS founder Dr Keshav Baliram Hedgewar were read out before the Swayamsevaks at the Reshimbagh function. Sameer Gautam, a member of Hedgewar Smarak Samiti, said the RSS founder had written a letter to all the members on January 21 1930, expressing support to the Congress move to pass a resolution pressing for complete independence. Five days later, in its Lahore session, the Congress went through with the motion.

“As the Congress had marked January 26 as the independence day, even the Swayamsevaks were asked to observe the day,” said Gautam, adding that RSS supports national cause cutting across political organizations.

The excise department is now looking for an agency to conduct geo-fencing of liquor outlets before establishing an integrated excise management system.The system, which was conceived last year but could not be implemented, will enable buyers to track the manufacturer of a liquor bottle along with other details that will ascertain its authenticity.The department has decided to pay 35 paisa per bottle to the agency that sets up the system. The move to determine the authenticity of liquor assumes significance because several gangs in Noida and Ghaziabad have been found selling spurious liquor in bottles bearing duplicate stickers of well-known brands.The excise department has sought proposals from agencies to implement the new system. “Once the new system has been implemented, a buyer will be able to see the nearest liquor outlet, prices of liquor in stock and other important details.

The tribal organisation also called for a two-day bandh on January 29 and 30, demanding the district administration and ITDA officials to strictly implement the 1/70 Act.

Further, the JAC demanded withdrawal of cases against a teacher, and 40 others, for allegedly demolishing tents at Kotha Balluguda village in Araku Valley mandal.

On Saturday, the police had arrested Suresh Kumar Venjula, a teacher by profession for allegedly supporting the villagers who demolished the tents.

JAC convenor Rama Rao Dora said that some businessmen have set up tents close to the girl’s hostel at Kotha Balluguda. “Some tourists, staying in the tents have been found making obscene gestures at the tribal girls,” Dora complained.

He further alleged that tourists living in tents were consuming alcohol and have also been enquiring about the availability of sex workers.

Honoured: District minister Kota Srinivas Poojari felicitates Harekala Hajabba at the Republic Day function Su... Read More

MANGALURU: It was a normal day in office on Saturday for ‘ Akshara Santha ’ when his basic Nokia handset rang to life. When he answered the call, little did Harekala Hajabba , 64, know that this call was all set to change his life and catapult him to national limelight . Hajabba has single-handedly revolutionised the educational dreams of a generation of children in his village of New Padpu , Harekala.

The call was from the ministry of home affairs to inform him of the Padma awards.

Standing in a queue to give his biometrics data for the ration that the government disburses through fair price shops, Hajabba said he did not understand much of the Hindi or English that the voice on the other side of the call spoke. Hajabba sought help from Abbas, an auto driver, who told him that the caller wanted to inform him about his selection for the country’s fourth-highest civilian award – the Padma Shri.

All this transpired around 11.30am. As the eventful day progressed, Hajabba sought help from his friends in the media to understand the import of the call. One of them, in turn, called up a senior IAS officer, who confirmed the government’s move to confer this award to Hajabba. As the news was formally announced, Hajabba was flooded with calls from friends and well-wishers who congratulated him and wanted to know what the award meant to him.

Accepting the felicitations that the district administration arranged for him at the Republic Day celebration, Hajabba later told TOI that it was the wish of the almighty that the government has selected him, a mere orange seller, for a national award. He thanked the media and elected representatives for highlighting his work. Hajabba said then deputy commissioner A B Ibrahim had recommended his name for the Padma awards in 2015.

His only wish through the Padma awards is that his dream of opening a PU college in the village become a reality. Hajabba thanked every stakeholder in his life for bringing this national recognition to him.

And for a change, a humble orange seller was the cynosure of all eyes at the Republic Day function, and most sought-after for selfies and pictures from admirers.

The site where the incident took place

NEW DELHI: Hari Shankar, the co-owner of the building in Bhajanpura that collapsed on Saturday evening, leading to the death of five people and injuring eight, was arrested on Sunday. Four children and their tutor, Umesh Kashyap (35), who was the other owner of the building, died when the under-construction roof of the third floor of the tuition centre collapsed. Kashyap and Shankar were brothers. Their wives also taught there.

On Sunday, forensic evidence was lifted from the site and the statements of the injured students was recorded by police. Some families have decided not to send their children to the tuition centre.

The families of the four deceased children — Furkan (6), Deeshu (12), Krishna (9) and Kirti (10) — said they had bought new clothes to perform at a function at school.

Deeshu death was a double whammy for his family as his grandmother had passed away just four days ago. “His birthday was on February 11 and we had planned to go to Vaishno Devi. He would often say ‘Fauji banunga’ and had even got an Army uniform stitched to perform in the Republic Day event at school. While practising, he had said ‘Aakhiri salaam’ (last salute). It seems what he said came true. I want to make him wear the uniform and cremate him,” said Mahipal, Deeshu’s father, a grocer.

Mahipal’s has two other children, Deepak (15) and a five-year-old daughter. Deepak also studied at the same tuition centre, but was in the morning batch.

The tuition centre called “Education Point” was started in 1996. The parents of the students said that both Kashyap, fondly called Ballu Bhaiya, and Shankar taught well. They called the incident a tragedy. “The fee was Rs 500, but if a family couldn’t afford it, then it was reduced. Ballu would even drop the children home if their parents were not able to pick them,” said Archana Tyagi, Kirti’s aunt, whose two children studied there.

Kirti and her elder brother, Yash, were together when the incident occurred. While Yash and Tyagi’s children were saved, Kirti’s body was recovered an hour later from under the debris. “My children will not go to the tuition centre anymore. Kirti had bought a dress for dancing in an event at school. She kept telling her mother to record her video and dress her properly,” said a sobbing Tyagi.

Local residents said at least 50 students were present at the tuition centre when the incident occurred. Classes were conducted on the ground, first and second floors. The maximum damage occurred on the second floor, but most students managed to escape. “Umesh tried his best to save the children from harm. His tuition centre was known not just in Bhajanpura, but other areas too,” said Ravinder Saini, Kashyap’s childhood friend.

Nikita Gupta, securing AIR 20 said that she did not take any tuitions for the course.

The national flag

The national flag was set ablaze at Thirumalapuram village of Kuravi mandal in Mahabubabad district on Sunday. A personal dispute between two government employees and the sarpanch led to the incident.

Sub-inspector Shankar Rao said that Thirumalapuram sarpanch Rambabu approached the police to lodge a complaint against one Karobar Upendar.

He alleged that an ongoing dispute between panchayat secretary Ramesh and Upender on the issues of governance, the latter deliberately set ablaze some papers pasted to the pole, after which the flames spread to the flag fluttering on top of the pole.

Rao said that the police is conducting an inquiry into the incident.

In another incident, Gundrapally sarpanch Rajeshwar Rao hoisted the national flag upside-down. Ward members brought this to the notice of rural district collector M Haritha.

In a similar incident, the rural district joint collector of Warangal, too, hoisted the flag upside-down, but immediately brought it down, set it right and hoisted the flag again.

131,['27/01/2020'],City’s East Point Golf Club set to become Category-I golf course this year,"This story is from January 27, 2020

Visakhapatnam: If everything goes as per plan, the East Point Golf Club (EPGC) at Mudasarlova area in Vizag city will be turning into a Category-I (Class-A) golf course by September this year. Once the EPGC gets the Category-I golf course tag, the EPGC will host national and international golf events.

The EPGC in Vizag city is the only major golf club in Andhra Pradesh which is open to the public with an 18-hole course. The golf club was categorised as a Class-B category golf course as it measured 6,041 yards. A Category-I golf course needs to measure over 6,700 yards.

Speaking to TOI, RVS Rudraraju, the secretary of EPGC, said that as per the norms set by the Indian Golf Union (IGU), the governing body of golf in India, a golf course should measure 6,700 yards to be able to host national and international golf events. “The works to redesign the East Point Golf Club and have it be a category-I golf course have been taking place in a phased manner and will be complete by 2020,” Rudraraju said.

“With Vizag all set to become the state’s executive capital, the port city will become a hub for golf tourism in the coming days and EPGC will host a good number of national golf events,” the EPGC secretary added.

Uday Shirname, former secretary of EPGC, said that the golf club is over a 100 years old and has more than 1,000 members, which include naval personnel, businessmen and professional golfers. “The landscaping and other works at EPGC have begun and once the works are complete, EPGC will get category-I status and will be able to host major golf tournaments,” Uday added.

The East Point Golf Club is spending over Rs 4 crore for the redesign of the course. The TDP government had allocated 12.72 acres of land close to the EPGC for further development of the club to attract international golfers.

“Since Vizag has emerged as a hub for cricket, badminton, and some other sports in Andhra Pradesh, it will will gain more importance in terms once it becomes the executive capital. Vizag also has better connectivity, which is ideal for golf tourism in the coming days,” an EPGC member said. The EPGC team has been chalking out plans to host some golf events at the club this year, they added.

132,['27/01/2020'],Karnataka: Youth draws PM Narendra Modi’s attention to delay in Kundapur flyover,"This story is from January 27, 2020

Vignesh Shenoy

MANGALURU: Vignesh Shenoy , a resident of Kundapur , has drawn Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attention over the pending flyover work in Kundapur. In a letter dated December 24, he wrote: “We have an NH-66 expansion project going on from the past 10 years. It is in the heart of the city, located near Shastri Circle and beside Gandhi Maidan.”

“Due to the slow-paced flyover construction, the city has seen several accidents and many fatalities. People are risking their lives as it is in the heart of the city, and it’s a junction. “We have tried to draw the attention of every single politician. Only Modi can look into this and get the works expedited,’’ Shenoy said in the letter, and requested the government to stop collecting toll fees until all the pending works are completed.

Shenoy, who works in the accounts department of a private firm, said he drew inspiration from the Pumpwell flyover in Mangaluru, and decided to write to the PM on the issue. He told TOI, “It was only after trolls and people taking up the issue at the national level, that the local MP decided to speed up the works of the Pumpwell flyover. In one month, the flyover work has seen a lot of progress. We want to build similar pressure on the government, to see to it that the works are completed as quickly as possible. It takes more than 15 minutes to cross the 1 kilometre stretch. When the works are not complete, what is the need to collect toll?” he questioned.

He has received a reply from the Prime Minister's office that his concern has been forwarded to the secretary, ministry of road transport and highways. This is Shenoy’s second letter to the PM on the issue. For a letter sent a few months ago, he received no response.

In October last year, Kundapur Taluk Journalists Association organised a Shastri Circle Chalo protest, to express displeasure over the delay in completion of flyover works on NH-66.

Nagpur: A delegation of Vidarbha Taxpayers Association ( VTA ), led by Shrawan Kumar Malu, called on the Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh to stress that the state government should exercise its powers and gradually implement the fines for traffic offences which have increased through the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act of 2019.

VTA’s secretary Tejinder Singh Renu told the minister that motor vehicle accidents and constant increase in traffic offences are a matter of concern and need attention.

The penalties to be levied from the offenders have been increased under the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act, 2019. The fines are high but the state reserves the power to lower them suitably. Renu said that the state government should gradually increase the present traffic fines. The police needs additional powers to control traffic as undiscipline can lead to many accidents and even fatalities, he said.

The home minister appreciated the suggestions submitted by VTA. Deshmukh assured that he will take views of DCP (traffic) on the matter and will take appropriate decision soon, said a press release issued by the VTA.

Trichy: Panchayat grama sabha meetings of the central and delta districts held on the occasion of Republic Day passed resolutions banning hydrocarbon exploration in their hamlets. During the inaugural grama sabha on Sunday held after electing the new representatives to the rural civic body, the youngsters in the area managed to persuade their civic body representatives to take a stand against the hydrocarbon project.

Recently, the Union environment ministry exempted the hydrocarbon exploration activities from the rigorous environmental impact assessment and public hearing. Following the development, villagers of Pudukkottai, Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts have utilised the grama sabha meetings as a tool to express their opposition by passing resolutions against any form of exploration activities in their jurisdictions. Neduvasal, Sornakadu, Azhagiyanayagipuram, Kaalagam and Andikkadu were among the agrarian hamlets in Thanjavur and Pudukkottai districts that passed resolutions banning hydrocarbon exploration in their respective jurisdictions. “We will send the copy of resolutions passed in the grama sabha meetings to the Union government. At any point of time, we will not allow the government or private companies to use our agriculture land to explore oil or gas,” Nimal Raghavan, a resident of Nadiyam panchayat in Thanjavur district , said.

People as voluntary groups irrespective of their political affiliation said that they had told the land owners in their villages not to give their land for any form of exploration projects. Stating that hydrocarbon exploration in the delta districts will be disastrous for the entire state, the grama sabha meetings asked the government to revive the farming sector. “Supportive data highlighting the economic benefits associated with agriculture in the villages in the districts will be sent to the government to make them realize the economic potential of encouraging farming in the delta districts,” Nimal added.

MANGALURU: The National Highways Authority of India in Dakshina Kannada district, which tops in implementation of electronic toll collection through the RFID-enabled tag has unearthed a scam where some multi-axle vehicles (MAV) and light commercial vehicles (LCV) were purportedly using FASTag RFID stickers meant for light motor vehicles .

According to NHAI and toll booth operation management members, the scam has been active for sometime now, after electronic toll collection was made mandatory, and it has caused heavy losses to toll booth contractors.

Shivaprasad Rai, toll manager (Talapady, Sastan and Hejamady), explaining about the scam, said that vehicle owners of MAVs and LCVs had been issued FASTag stickers by producing documents of LCVs. The same stickers were fixed in their vehicles. “When MAV and LCV vehicles are scanned at toll booths, operators do not check FASTag registration (like vehicle numbers and other details). Once the machine scans the vehicle, money is deducted and the toll gate opens automatically and allows vehicles to proceed. During a thorough check, we found that some of the MAVs and LCVs are cheating toll booths using FASTag stickers meant for LMVs. The MAVs and LCVs have higher toll fee compared to LMV. We have reported such vehicles,” he added.

According to NHAI officials, the highest number of such cases was reported in Talapady, Surathkal and Hejamady toll booths.

These FASTag stickers are issued by e-commerce and private banks. FASTag was implemented for all vehicles across the country, instead of manual payment of toll, and was made mandatory from January 15. Shishu Mohan, project director, NHAI, told TOI that all such LMV FASTag stickers fixed in MAVs and LCVs have been blocked. The toll booth operators are asked to report the same, he said.

VISAKHAPATNAM: The Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) will shoulder the responsibility of developing nearly 6,150 acres land. Land pockets across 10 mandals in the district, are being pooled by the district administration for distribution of housing sites to eligible beneficiaries under the ‘Pedalandariki Illu’ scheme.

As per a government order released on Saturday, the VMRDA will retain a 15 per cent share of the developed land to meet the expenses incurred. It has been estimated that the development of each acre of land will cost around Rs 50 lakh.

The developmental activities will include making plots, roads and a drainage system. Nearly 1.5 lakh beneficiaries have been found eligible for this scheme.

Speaking to TOI, VMRDA metropolitan commissioner P Koteswara Rao said that the development costs per acre varies from mandal to mandal based on the terrain and varied geological conditions. “The VMRDA will get 15% of the developed land for developing these lands,” Koteswara Rao said.

These 6,100 acre lands are primarily owned by the government and are being enjoyed by assignees and encroachers for decades. Under the land pooling scheme, the assignees will get 900 square yards developed plot per acre.

Encroachers who have settled for more than 10 years will be given 450 square yards plot per acre. Those who have been squatting for 5to 10 years will get 250 square yards land.

After allotting their share of the developed land to individuals and setting aside 15% for the VMRDA, the remaining part of the developed land will be vested with the district collector for housing scheme for weaker sections.

The state government, through an order released on Saturday also included encroached lands and lands specified in the AP Assigned Lands (POT) Act, 1977in the land pooling scheme.

These lands were beyond the purview of guidelines issued in the earlier orders. But the state government is taking up the housing scheme as a special case and a one time measure to distribute housing sites to the homeless and weaker sections of society.

However, the Left parties have demanded the state government to stall the on-going land pooling exercise in the district as it will deprive farmers of their livelihood.

VMRDA chairman Dronamraju Srinivas, who was present at the occasion confirmed the incident and said, “It is an insult to the national flag, that too on such an important day. However, it is not the minister’s mistake. It was obviously the mistake of the people organising the ceremony. We are all taking collective responsibility for the goof-up.”

AHMEDABAD: When Arun Nandewal, a 2018-20 batch PGP student at IIM-Ahmedabad (IIM-A), and his batchmates searched for textbooks on product management in India, they found just one. It was a book by IIT-Madras alumnus.

So Nandewal and 20 batchmates decided to write a textbook themselves, incorporating the latest developments in e-commerce websites , cab aggregators, massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) including PUBG , blockchain , and many other aspects. Also included were the best practices and product development, and their links with various business verticals.

The team began writing the book in June last year and within six months it was ready with a 125-page book titled ‘Futuristic Outlook to Product Management Industry Review Guide 2019’. Nandewal, the lead author, said that the group is now attempting to introduce the book for course learning at IIM-A.

Ananya Dalal, one of the youngest members on the team, said the book will be a valuable resource. “It’s a dynamic book and our team expects it to be updated by each batch that comes after us,” he said. “The textbook is being peer reviewed and we have already taken suggestions from our professors.”

Nandewal said the book is for absolute beginners, and those who want to switch jobs or prepare for interviews. He said that each of his batchmates involved in writing the chapters had working experience in new domains such as blockchain, brand lifecycle, gaming, and OTT platforms. “We decided to collect and write case studies for the team,” he said. “The project soon attracted students from PGPX, PGP-FABM, and FPM programmes as well — bringing in the mix of experience and knowledge.”

Anshuman Singh, a PGPX student, said with his 14 years of experience in technology firms, he contributed a real-time product management case in the book. “Product management is an emerging area and almost all tech giants are hiring for it,” he said.

Krishna-the bull elephant at the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park

VISAKHAPATNAM: While a slew of visitors thronged the Visakhapatnam zoo on Sunday, many were not allowed the opportunity to meet Krishna— the elephant at the elephant enclosure. The local zoo’s famed bull elephant was in no mood to socialise and was even seen avoiding its mahout.

Some visitors who did manage to get a sight of him said that the elephant was trying to get out of this enclosure and was probably in musth.

Zoo authorities however refuted claims of the elephant behaving in an abnormal manner. “The elephant was not chained. But it was not approaching the mahout for some reason. Sometimes, they do not want the attention of humans. This was one of these days. However, it was not trying to get out of his enclosure, which is trenched anyway,” said Yesoda Bai, curator of Indira Gandhi Zoological Park.

Visitors however did maintain that the elephant was obviously trying to avoid people and said that the zoo staff had kept a close eye on the jumbo.

The curator too said that the staff was watching the elephant’s movements closely. “The elephant was trying to be alone. It was trying to avoid all the noise,” the curator added.

Sources at the zoo pointed out that this is not the first time that one of the elephant’s at the zoo has been in a foul mood. They informed that a female elephant had displayed similar traits some time ago. The curator strongly maintained that the elephant was not in musth.

NEW DELHI: The Padma award selection process has, over the past five years, become broad-based and more diligent to ensure a wide section of society and individuals representing a range of disciplines are recognised and honoured.

There were 46,000 nominations this year as compared to 2,200 in 2014, a 20-fold jump as the selection process has ensured that Padma awards move beyond the Delhi and Mumbai elites, with a greater focus on east and south India, an official said.

Sources said the effort has been to seek out stories and individuals who represent mainstream as well as niche disciplines and are making a significant contribution in a selfless and dedicated manner. By awarding people from ordinary walks of life along with celebrities, the government has sought to provide examples for citizens, regardless of their social background, to emulate. It has also provided inspiration as the Padma awards have recognised people who were hidden from the gaze of mainstream media.

In this year’s list, those awarded include Jagdish Lal Ahuja, who has been organising free food at PGIMER, Chandigarh, since the 1980s. Mohammad Sharif has been performing the last rites of unclaimed bodies for the last 25 years without differentiating on the basis of religion. Javed Ahmad is differently-abled and has been working with physically and intellectually challenged children in Pulwama and Anantnag . In her 70s, Tulsi Gowda is a reservoir of tribal knowledge of herbs and plants. Women from a wide range of disciplines have been recognised.

Sporting disciplines that are less discussed, such as kabaddi and basketball, have found recognition, as have para Olympians .

They had to work till 4am through the night to supervise the digging up work on pedestrian plaza and then return to work at 10am to attend to other issues.""It required co-ordination with other agencies like TANGEDCO, Metrowater and police. For instance, in one case Metrowater had to be coaxed to remove blocks in a pipeline which was then done using a robotic machine,"" said an official.Also multiple rounds of negotiations were conducted with the traders in Pondy Bazaar who suspected that the wide footpath was a backdoor move to bring back hawkers on to the road. ""We convinced that this would increase their business as foreigners would come in. They are now happy,"" the official said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73648754,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-254544,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/marquee-projects-bring-greater-chennai-corporation-engineers-accolades/articleshow/73648611.cms

A joint police team of three states —Delhi, UP and Bihar —conducted raids on the ancestral house of JNU studen... Read More

NEW DELHI: Former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Sharjeel Imam has been booked for delivering inflammatory speeches in opposition to Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register for Citizens (NRC). A Delhi Police team along with cops from Aligarh and Bihar Police raided his residence in Bihar, but he was not found.

“A case under IPC sections 124 (offence by words, either spoken or written causes disaffection against government), 153 (promoting enmity between different religious groups with an intent to create disharmony) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) has been registered against Imam. He is currently absconding and efforts are being made to nab him,” said a senior Crime Branch officer.

Investigating officials said Imam had delivered a similar speech at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13, 2019. Another speech of his, which was even more inflammatory and instigative against the government, was widely circulated on social media.

The Special Investigation Team of Crime Branch which registered the case is also probing the violence that occurred at Jamia on December 15 last year.

Meanwhile, the alumni of JNU’s Centre for Historical Studies , where Imam had studied, condemned his divisive statements. “Some TV channels are reporting that a JNU alumnus, Sharjeel Imam, said that the present anti-CAA movement is capable of permanently or temporarily cutting off the Northeast from India. The purpose of the legitimate, democratic, protests is exactly the opposite: to keep India socially and territorially a beautiful, harmonious nation. We, the students and alumni of Centre for Historical Studies, where Imam studied, reject with all contempt his alleged statement that calls for India to be dismembered,” read a statement by the alumni.

Protesters gathered at the Rajarathinam Stadium

CHENNAI: A group of close to 300 people protested against the Citizenship Amendment Act in the city on Sunday. The protesters, who gathered at the Rajarathinam Stadium in Egmore around 7pm, raised slogans against the features of the law till it was past midnight. They then moved to the Chintadripet police station and demonstrated.

Earlier, at midnight on Saturday, more than 100 people with disabilities assembled outside the Madras high court to protest against implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Population Register (NPR). They held a peaceful candle light vigil holding posters.

S Namburajan of the Tamil Nadu Association for the Rights of All Types of Differently Abled and Caregivers said once implemented, the registry will have an adverse impact on the lives of the disabled. “At least 20% of people with disabilities were abandoned by their families or relatives on the streets. Now, if they ask for documents of their forefathers, where will they get them from? Government offices are not accessible. The government has no solution for that,” he said.

He further added that it took a long time for people to avail benefits because many did not get their Aadhaar cards. “Because of NPR, their plight might worsen,” he said.

KOCHI: Continuing the debate on "" Love Jihad "" in Kerala, a senior priest of the Catholic Church said the incidents of young women from the southern state being used as "" sex slaves "" in war-torn nations are a reality and turning a blind eye to it ""amounts to giving a silent sanction"" to that.

Days after the state government rejected the Syro-Malabar Church Bishops ' view over the issue of ""Love Jihad"" in the state, KCBC spokesperson Fr Varghese Vallikkatt has criticised the state and central governments for not conducting a proper probe into the cases of ""missing women and children"" from the state.

Kerala Catholic Bishops Council (KCBC) is the Apex body of the Bishops of various Catholic rites in Kerala. Syro-Malabar Church head Cardinal George Alencherry is its current president. Asserting that 'Love Jihad' is a reality, Vallikkatt said in a video released on Sunday that ignoring such incidents ""amounts to giving a silent sanction"" to it.

In the video clip, aired by media, the priest said no effective investigation has been carried out either by the Centre or by the state government into the whereabouts of the people who went missing ""after being trapped in love"".

Quoting media reports, Vallikkatt said such missing women and children were later traced to other nations where they are being used as sex slaves and terror operatives. Referring to the incidents of Christian women taken to Syria and Afghanistan after being allegedly trapped in ""Love Jihad"", he said some of them were traced even to jails of the conflict-hit nations. The priest further said the probe into the cases of 'Love Jihad' have not reached the real culprits so far.

He blamed governments for not maintaining a data of 'Love Jihad' cases even after the courts made strong observations on it.

Vallikkatt said that, in the video, he was expressing the views of the people on the issue.

His statement is also in line with the stand of the Synod of the Syro-Malabar Church, which recently kicked up a debate, saying ""Love Jihad is a reality"" and alleged that scores of Christian women from the state were being lured into the trap of Islamic State and used in terror activities.

The Synod has accused the state police of not viewing the matter cautiously and taking timely action in Love Jihad cases.

Responding to the allegations of the Synod, Kerala finance minster Thomas Isaac had said the charges of the Bishops have ""no factual basis.""

""If there are concrete cases or allegations, they will definitely be looked into. But the Kerala government does not believe that there is any basis for such generalisation,"" he had said.

Noida executive’s killing: Police say verifying involvement of more gangsters in crime

NOIDA: Nearly three weeks after the murder of a senior executive of a healthcare firm, who was allegedly killed while on his way home on the night of January 6 and his car taken away, the Hapur police has arrested a member of the mirchi gang, Umesh Pandit, for the crime.In another sensational twist, Hapur police claimed that Pandit later tried to “flee” while being taken to Masuri for recovering the mobile and laptop of the murdered executive, Gaurav Chandel. Police said Pandit snatched a senior sub-inspector’s pistol and tried to shoot. “Police retaliated and Pandit was shot in both legs,” Hapur SP Sanjiv Suman said.Earlier, police said Pandit was held with gang leader Ashu Jaat’s wife and her twomonth-old daughter. Police said Pandit and Jaat orchestrated Chandel’s murder. He was taken at gunpoint around 10.30pm on January 6.The gangsters had allegedly taken away Chandel’s Kia Seltos SUV. Pandit has also admitted to looting a Tiago car, belonging to Ghaziabad resident Chirag Agrawal, police said.Pandit, who along with his younger brother Dalvir has been associated with the gang for the past few years, was arrested by the Hapur police while travelling with Poonam, wife of gang leader Ashu Jaat, in the Dehra area of Dhaulana in Hapur district.Police said that Pandit was on a Hero Passion bike along with Poonam and the infant. They were going to Karanpurjatt area in Dhaulana.A 32 bore pistol, three live cartridges and keys of the looted Tiago were recovered from the accused, police said. A 9mm licensed pistol looted from a police officer was also recovered from Pandit.Additional DCP Ranvijay Singh told TOI that while both Ashu and Pandit were involved in the Gaurav Chandel loot and murder case, four people were involved in the Tiago case.“The four who had carried out the Tiago car robbery were Ashu, Umesh and two persons from Seemapuri who are being identified,” the DCP said.DCP (central Noida) Harish Chander said prima facie it seems only two persons were involved in the Gaurav Chandel case but they are verifying the involvement of more gangsters. “Ashu continues to be on the run. We are working to arrest him,” he added.According to sources, the Hapur police officers first got a breakthrough in the investigation and sourced the information about the whereabouts of Pandit.“Ashu has a major network in Dhaulana since his wife belongs to the area and he also gets financial help from his parents-inlaw there. Neither he nor his wife carries a phone, making it difficult to catch them,” a senior police officer said.In Video: Noida executive’s ‘killer’ tries to flee, shot in leg",noida,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73651378,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-226475,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-executives-killer-tries-to-flee-shot-in-leg/articleshow/73648622.cms

The damaged interiors of the toll booth at Paranur

CHENNAI: Enraged passengers along with the driver and conductor of an SETC bus vandalised a toll plaza at Paranur near Chengalpet on Sunday. The flashpoint was an argument between the bus conductor and a toll plaza worker around 1pm.

A few toll booth and gadgets were damaged, resulting in a halt in toll collection for the entire afternoon. Traffic resumed on the stretch after two hours after the intervention of police personnel.

Chengalpet superintendent of police D Kannan said, ""We have detained two people each from both sides and will book a case."" The available CCTV camera footage shows that it was an impulsive reaction by the public and not a premeditated one. Police will analyse the camera footage further to help nab suspects involved in the rampage, said the officer. ""It was a riot-like situation with passengers and motorists on one side and toll plaza staff on the other,"" a witness said.

The SETC bus from Koyambedu was headed towards Trichy. Around 1pm, it reached the Paranur toll plaza , where the toll plaza staff demanded the bus crew to pay toll charges, though government buses are usually not required to pay toll. Pasumpon, the bus conductor, and the driver approached a toll booth staff, Muthu, and sought to know why were they being asked to pay toll.

As the SETC staff and Muthu entered into an argument, another toll booth staff attacked the driver and conductor, sources said. Soon, passengers of the bus got down and came in support of the bus crew, police said.

Angered over the attack on them, the SETC crew used their bus to block the traffic lanes. Passengers of the bus and other motorists joined them in damaging the window panels of the toll counters, CCTV cameras and several gadgets used to collect toll. Other bus drivers and conductors joined in support of their colleagues and vandalised the toll booths.

172,['27/01/2020'],AIIMS offers Delhi’s first lung transplant,"AIIMS, Delhi

Docs: Getting cadaver lungs for transplant hardest part

NEW DELHI: AIIMS , which pioneered heart transplants in India, has now decided to conduct lung transplants too — making it the first hospital in the capital and the second public institution in the country to offer the procedure after PGIMER, Chandigarh.AIIMS had recently applied for a licence to conduct the life-saving surgery, which the health ministry granted. The institute is now screening potential candidates — patients with chronic, end-stage lung disease for whom no effective medical therapy exists — to prepare a waiting list.Dr Anant Mohan, professor and head of pulmonary medicine at AIIMS, said one patient had been selected for the surgery a few weeks ago but he died before the transplant could be carried out. “We are preparing a list of two to three other potential candidates,” he added.Lung transplant, like a heart transplant, can only be carried out with organ donated by a deceased donor. Till date, only about 4,000 such transplants have been done globally, including about 200 in India.All lung transplants in India, except for one, have been performed at private hospitals where the procedure can cost Rs 20-30 lakh or more. Follow-up medications, which have to be taken lifelong, cost several lakhs a year.AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said the institute will not only conduct the transplant free of cost, but will also provide the follow-up medicines at no cost.A lung transplant is a surgical procedure to remove one or both diseased lungs from a patient and replace it with a healthy one from a cadaver donor. The world’s first lung transplant was conducted in human in 1963 in the US. But due to high rejection rate and healing issues, fewer transplants could be conducted in the decades to come.Some doctors in the US have also attempted living donor lung transplants, where a part of the lung from the donor is transplanted, but the results haven’t been encouraging yet.Between 1999 and 2011, records show, five foreigners underwent lung transplants in various hospitals in south India.In 2012, a 41-year-old woman from Mumbai became the first Indian to undergo the life-saving surgery. She was suffering from pulmonary fibrosis, in which lung tissue gets scarred and breathing becomes difficult.Dr A G K Gokhale, chief cardiothoracic and transplant surgeon at Apollo Chennai said with rising lifeexpectancy and increase in lung diseases, the demand for lung transplant has gone up.“The availability of high-end antibiotics and improved surgical techniques has raised the success rate of the surgery but there aren’t enough cadaver donors. Also, the cost of surgery as well as post-operative care are high and out of reach for many,” he added.Another doctor, who has led several lung transplant surgeries down south, said states like Telangana have come up with new rules banning the policy of giving organs retrieved from cadaver donors to foreigners. “This has also led to significant reduction in such transplants because not many people can afford the postoperative care,” he said.The survival rate among recipients of lung transplant in India is much less as compared to that in the US, doctors said.Public sector hospital PGIMER Chandigarh recently conducted a lung transplant on a 33-year-old woman. The surgery was successful but the patient developed a multi-drug resistant infection post-transplant which led to her death in 14 days.According to Dr A K Bisoi, who was part of the team led by Dr P Venugopal that conducted India’s first heart transplant in 1994, technical feasibility isn’t the most difficult part when it comes to conducting a heart or lung transplant.“The tough part is to arrange suitable cadaver donors. Also, most patients in a country like ours cannot afford post-transplant care, which involves taking immunosuppressive medications daily and living in a sanitised environment to reduce the risk of infections,” he said.To deal with the shortage of cadaver donors, some scientists are also working to develop an artificial lung that’s small enough to be carried in a backpack.Currently, such patients are dependent on large machines such as extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for breathing support.According to reports, University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh have conducted animal trials for the artificial lung developed by them and, the researchers say, human trials will be done soon.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73648896,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-197350,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aiims-offers-delhis-first-lung-transplant/articleshow/73648891.cms

A forecast by the Met department said, ""The sky condition is likely to be mainly clear. Mist is likely to occur in some areas during early morning hours. Maximum temperature will be 31 degree Celsius and minimum temperature is likely to be around 20 degree Celsius.""

Private weather bloggers have said that a high pressure is the reason for cold nights. ""There is no cloud cover to trap the heat. So the heat escapes from the atmosphere resulting in colder nights, "" said Pradeep John, a weather blogger.

189,['27/01/2020'],"Are judges, serving &amp; retired, the sole repository of rectitude in public life?","This story is from January 27, 2020

Judiciary is virtually running the country’. This decade-old common public refrain is getting shriller. From the freedom struggle days, people tend to romanticise anyone who courageously stands up against the mighty government.

Till the advent of coalition politics , which allowed leaders of smaller political parties to flex muscles, the judiciary usually adhered to its constitutionally defined role. Squabbling in coalitions for a greater share in corruption-ridden governments eroded public faith in politicians. This created space for the judiciary to earn public adulation for calling a spade a spade. The praise emboldened constitutional courts to continuously ‘experiment with the elasticity of their jurisdictions’ and step into the exclusive turf of legislature and executive.

A prime example of this ‘experiment’ came last week in the Supreme Court ’s judgment in Keisham Meghachandra Singh case. A three-judge bench headed by Justice R F Nariman dealt with the impartiality and expediency with which petitions seeking disqualification of people’s representatives for alleged anti-party activities should be decided.

In an unprecedented ruling, it fixed a three-month limit for a Speaker to decide such petitions. What will be the judges’ reaction if the legislature asks them to give decision in each case within six months? The bench went on to recommend obliteration of the Speaker’s role altogether in dealing with such petitions. It advised Parliament to amend the tenth schedule to set up a permanent tribunal headed by a retired SC judge or HC chief justice, or some other independent mechanism for swift and impartial decision.

In November last year, an almost identical issue — disqualification of Karnataka MLAs by the Speaker for defection — engaged an SC bench headed by Justice NV Ramana. It did not experiment with the ‘elasticity of jurisdiction’, even though it called a spade a spade by regretting the partisan conduct of speakers.

“The Speaker, being a neutral person, is expected to act independently while conducting proceedings of the House or adjudication of any petition… His political affiliations cannot come in the way of adjudication. There is a growing trend of speakers acting against the constitutional duty of being neutral,” it had said.

What differentiated the two judgments is the recent order’s suggestion for creation of a permanent panel headed by a retired SC judge or HC chief justice. This appears to stem from a presumption, which has gained currency in the recent past both among the judiciary and the public, that judges are infallible.

Chief architect of the Constitution , B R Ambedkar, had refused to put his money on this presumption. Rejecting demands in the Constituent Assembly to make it mandatory for the President to appoint SC and HC judges with the concurrence of the Chief Justice of India, he had said on May 24, 1949, “With regard to concurrence of CJI, it seems to me that those who advocate that position seem to rely implicitly on the impartiality of the CJI and the soundness of his judgment.

“I personally feel no doubt that CJI is very eminent person. But after all, the CJI is a man with all failings, all sentiments and all the prejudices which we as common people have; and I think, to allow the CJI practically a veto upon the appointment of judges is really to transfer the authority to the CJI, which we are not prepared, to veto the President or the government of the day. I, therefore, think that is also a dangerous proposition.” This was accepted by the Constituent Assembly. Half a century later, that “dangerous proposition” became reality. The Supreme Court by its two judgments amended the constitutional procedure for appointment of Supreme Court and high court judges through judicial interpretation, without changing a letter either in Article 124 or Article 217 of the Constitution.

What is the guarantee that a retired SC judge or HC CJ, as head of a permanent panel to decide petitions under the Tenth Schedule, will do an impartial job? Then sitting SC judge Ranganath Misra headed a commission to inquire into the 1984 anti-Sikh riots , in which an estimated 3,000 people were killed. The commission found no one guilty. After completing his tenure as CJI, Justice Misra became a Congress Rajya Sabha MP.

There are so many such instances that would allow politicians to take potshots at the idea of a retired judge heading a permanent panel on the anti-defection law, which they feel squarely falls within the political thicket.

Probably, that was the reason which persuaded a threejudge SC bench headed by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi to delineate the role of the three constitutional governance organs in its judgment in ‘Dr Ashwini Kumar vs Union of India’ on September 5, 2019. It had said, “While exercising this power of judicial review, the courts do not encroach upon the field marked by the Constitution for the legislature and the executive, as the courts examine legality and validity of the legislation or the governmental action, and not the wisdom behind the legislative measure or relative merits or demerits of the governmental action.

“Neither does the Constitution permit the courts to direct, advise or sermonise others in the spheres reserved for them by the Constitution, provided the legislature or the executive do not transgress their constitutional limits or statutory conditions. Referring to the phrase ‘all power is of an encroaching nature’, which the judiciary checks while exercising the power of judicial review, it has been observed that the judiciary must be on guard against encroaching beyond its bounds since the only restraint upon it is the self-imposed discipline of self-restraint.” We say no more.

190,['27/01/2020'],TDP to skip crucial Andhra assembly session on Monday,"This story is from January 27, 2020

Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly

AMARAVATI: As Andhra Pradesh government is set to pass a resolution to abolish the legislative council, TDP has decided to boycott the assembly session on Monday. TDP has only 21 MLAs in the 175-member assembly. The party wants to stay away from the session to show that the resolution was taken in the absence of the opposition. The decision was taken at TDP legislature party meeting held on Sunday. Led by opposition leader Chandrababu Naidu , the meeting discussed strategy to take on the government.

Curiously, at least six MLCs stayed away from the meeting. Although those who abstained from the meeting had conveyed their inability to attend the meet on personal and health grounds, it triggered panic in opposition circles in the wake of YSRC's alleged attempts to poach some MLCs ahead of Monday's session.

Sources said MLCs Satrucharla Vijayaramaraju, KE Prabhakar, Gali Saraswathi, Tippe Swamy, AS Ramakrishna, Dokka Manikyavaraprasad abstained from the meeting. While Manikyavaprasad had sent his resignation letter to Naidu, Vijayaramaraju cited health grounds for his absence. As many as 23 MLCs of the total 32 attended the meeting.

Absence of MLCs is not going to play a big role in the current situation unless the government decides to reconvene the council which was indefinitely adjourned by the chairman on Wednesday.

Speaking to media after the meeting, MLC Bachula Arjunudu said the party has decided not to attend the session as there was no provision to discuss developments in the council in the assembly. ""YSRC is going ahead with unilateral decisions. They are going to move the resolution to abolish the council after failing to woo us,"" said Arjunudu.

Taken aback on knowing about Padma award: Singer’s son

JAIPUR: Sixty-one-year-old bhajan singer Ramzan Khan is yet to soak in the happiness and honour that a Padma Shri award has brought with it. Ever since his son Firoze Khan got embroiled in a controversy over his appointment as an assistant professor of Sanskrit at Benaras Hindu University two months ago, the family has been living in fear. The Padma Shri has helped ease the tension a bit, and brought some cheer to them.Soon after joining BHU’s Sanskrit department, Firoze had faced the ire of right-wing protesters who launched a four-day dharna (sit-in protest) on November 7, 2019, demanding his removal for being a Muslim. Firoze resigned on December 9 and joined the varsity’s arts department.The official press release of the recipients of the accolade identifies Munna Master Bhajan Gayak — as Ramzan is popularly known — as a bhajan singer from a traditional Muslim family of Bagru in Jaipur. The sexagenarian has been carrying forward the family legacy of singing Ram-Krishna bhajans in temples for a living.He has also authored a book, ‘Shri Shyam Surabhi Vandana’, which contains bhajans praising Lord Krishna, Ram, Vishnu and Shiva. Ramzan is also known for his love of cows. Every day, he takes out time from his busy schedule to visit cow shelters for feeding and taking care of the animals.I was taken aback (on announcement of Padma Shri award) for a few minutes and after confirming from different news sources several times over, I broke the news to my father (Ramzan Khan). He took some time to digest the news, before saying that singing bhajans was his source of income and he never thought this would help him achieve such an honour,” an elated Firoze told TOI over the phone from the BHU campus, adding that he first heard of the news from a friend around 9pm on Saturday. “We thank Allah for the izzat afzai (fame).”TOI tried reaching out to Ramzan but his phone was switched off. His younger son, Shakil, informed that his father had gone for a Bhajan Sandhya Jagran. “My father will not return before early morning,” said Shakil, while adding that his phone has been flooded with calls and messages from family, friends and the media. Shakil, however, clarified that they are yet to receive an official communication either from the central or the state government. “Neither Firoze bhaijaan nor my father have received any official confirmation.

196,['27/01/2020'],An insurance plan that covers your friends too,"(Representative image)

CHENNAI: Friend Assurance feature proposed by health insurance companies will now allow both friends and families to buy a health insurance policy, besides a discount awarded to the healthiest group.Religare Health Insurance, Max Bupa Health Insurance and Kotak Mahindra General Insurance which had proposed the idea of ‘friend assurance’ under the Regulatory Sandbox had received Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority’s (IRDA) nod earlier this month.The insurance regulator has set February 1 as deadline to roll out this feature on pilot basis for a period of six months.Under this policy, customers can now cover not just their families but also their friends under one policy number. “The objective is to acknowledge and reward people who lead a healthy life and so, why restrict only with the family. A 15% discount on premium at the time of renewal will be awarded if there are no claims made (for in-patient care) in the year,” said Religare Health Insurance, which will make this new addition on its existing Group Care product, and offer under Rs 5 lakh - Rs 10 lakh cover.This new policy will have similar benefits of any health insurance policy, and strength of the group will vary between five to 30. Under this concept, the group will be given scores based on various behaviours like number of doctor consultations, number of health checkups based on which renewal premium will be decided.Max Bupa Health Insurance has decided to roll out the friend assurance feature on its existing group policy — Health Companion. “Depending on the group’s cumulative score, we will decide the discount. We do estimate an average discount of 5%-10% if the entire group has a good score,” Max Bupa’s spokesperson said.This friend assurance feature will be available on all its policies and on covers ranging between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 1 crore. “We have defined the group with a minimum of seven members, but no restriction on upper limit,” he added.Earlier IRDA had placed restriction on this concept, that a group cannot be formed just for purpose of buying insurance or availing discounts. The concern was that there should be a commonality in nature of members of group (a homogeneous group). This new product aims to get people to lead a healthier lifestyle, besides initiating social interaction among the members and keep them motivated.Friend Assurance policy offers features similar to retail products, where the group that does not make any claim will get a 15% premium cash back at the end of year.

Representative image

MYSURU: Thousands of primary and high school guest teachers in Karnataka who draw a monthly honorarium of Rs 7,500 and Rs 8,000, respectively, haven't been paid since the 2019-20 academic year began in June. Government first-grade college guest lecturers, who are paid between Rs 11,000 and Rs 13,000, are unpaid since August.

Chandrasekar Nuggi, general secretary, Karnataka State Primary Teachers' Association, said the government has released money and the guest teachers are expected to get their honorarium soon. Hassan's deputy director of public instruction Prakash promised the teachers will get their dues from the commissioner's office, which has received the money released by the government.

Deputy CM CN Ashwath Narayana, who holds the higher education portfolio, said he will ensure early release of the pending amount. But his assurance came without a timeline.

But the ground reality is that teachers have been going to institutions every day in the hope of seeing some money trickling into their bank accounts.

A guest teacher from the district called the delay ""inhuman"". ""The honorarium of Rs 7,500 is less. Any delay is only adding to our woes,"" she added. ""How can we conduct classes with 100% dedication without pay ,"" she asked.

Gangadhara KB, a guest teacher, urged the government to increase the honorarium, confirm their employment and ensure timely payment of salary.

The tale of hundreds of guest lecturers in government first-grade colleges is equally tragic. They are paid between Rs 11,000 (for those with a PG degree) and Rs 13,000 (PG with additional qualification like NET or KSET or PhD) a month. They have been waiting to see that elusive pay since August.

R Mugeshappa, joint director, department of collegiate education, said he was aware of the delayed payment. ""But this amount is now credited directly from the head office,"" he said.

202,['27/01/2020'],New $3.8 billion fund to fuel Tiger Global's deals,"(Representative image)

BENGALURU: Tiger Global Management , one of the earliest big backers of India's internet story, will continue to actively back startups in India as the firm has closed a mega $3.8 billion global private investment vehicle, said one source directly briefed on the matter.India will be among the three key focus geographies for the new vehicle - Tiger Global Private Investment Partners XII - along with China and the US as the firm emerged as one of the most aggressive backers of startups in the country in 2019 with 23 deals, as per data from Tracxn, after more than a three-year hiatus.The new fund is one of the largest private pools to invest in technology companies globally and is similar to $3.8 billion that the New York-based investment firm raised at the end of 2018. ""The strategy for the new fund remains the same as the previous funds,"" said the source mentioned above.Despite sobering sentiments around startups, Tiger Global has continued its deal-making activity. Over the last few months, it has emerged as one of the leading contenders to back sports fantasy startup Dream11 in its $300-400 million round at a valuation of over $2 billion, said two sources briefed on the matter.TOI had reported that Tiger Global along with Softbank Vision Fund and Prosus (earlier Naspers ) are in early talks to back Dream11 in August. Tiger Global could be joined by Dragoneer as a new investor in the Mumbai-based startup, though a deal has not been finalised yet, said the two sources mentioned above.Another startup that Tiger Global is in talks with is Public, a new product focusing on location-based social video sharing platform which has been started by its portfolio company News In Shorts. ""They have signed a term sheet for the deal but not closed the deal as they are waiting for regulatory clarity,"" said one of the sources briefed on the deal, adding that Public may be spun out from News In Shorts if the deal closes.While a Dream11 spokesperson declined to comment on 'industry speculations', queries sent to News In Shorts founder Azhar Iqubal and Tiger Global did not elicit any response.The developments come at a time when there is increasing scrutiny over valuations of private technology companies after failed public offering of WeWork, which saw its valuation fall from $47 billion to $8 billion. Its main backer, Japan's Softbank Vision Fund, which is also the biggest backer of startups in India, has also scaled-down plans for its new fund signaling sobering up of money flow into high-cash-burn companies. There has already been an impact on India as several Unicorns like hospitality major Oyo and ride-hailing major Ola, both backed by Softbank, besides classifieds player Quikr have between them laid off several thousand employees in the last few months.But money flow is expected to continue at the early and mid-stages. While Accel India closed a $550 million fund for India in December, TOI reported last week that Sequoia Capital is raising a record $1.3 billion for a new India and Southeast Asia fund later this year. Venture capital investors tracking the space said the pace of deals closing in a few weeks in 2019 is now gone, but good companies with a clear path to profitability will continue to get money.Tiger Global saw its head of private investments Lee Fixel, who started the firm's India investments in 2006, leave the firm which had led to speculation that its focus on the country will slow down. But Scott Shleifer, who has taken over the unit from Fixel, has turned even more aggressive.This is because for Tiger Global, India has been lucrative market as it scripted one of the biggest M&A deals in country's corporate history when US retail giant Walmart acquired 77% in India’s largest online retailer Flipkart for $16 billion in 2018. Tiger Global, which bet $1 billion on the success of Flipkart since 2009, made over $3.3 billion in the transaction and still owns around 5% stake. Exits have continued, as it got over $150 million when it sold a 10% stake in Policybazaar last year with over 5-6 times returns.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73653377,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-78784,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-3-8-billion-fund-to-fuel-tiger-globals-deals/articleshow/73650110.cms

NEW DELHI: Apple seems in no mood to give up Lightning port and adopt standard charger (in other words same charger as supported by most Android phones). Responding to European Union's proposal to make all companies offer provide same chargers for all mobile phones , Apple said that making all companies use the same type of connector ""stifles innovation rather than encouraging it....""

""We hope the (European) Commission will continue to seek a solution that does not restrict the industry's ability to innovate,"" the company said in a statement.

The Cupertion giant's statement comes after members od European Parliament (MEPs) recently said that they want the company to introduce common charger as this would help ""reduce electronic waste and make consumers' life easier.""

The proposed draft law more aim to reduce electronic waste, which is estimated to amount to 51,000 tonnes per year in old chargers. The MEPs said that attempts to make companies use the same charger voluntarily have failed. The European Commission has been pushing for a common charger for over a decade. European Commision, which acts as the executive for the EU, may come with new regulation to ensure companies are forced to support same chargers.

Apple manitains that the proposal is ""bad for the environment and unnecessarily disruptive for customers"". ""We want to ensure that any new legislation will not result in the shipment of any unnecessary cables or external adapters with every device, or render obsolete the devices and accessories used by many millions of Europeans and hundreds of millions of Apple customers worldwide,"" Apple added.

Almost all new Android phones come with USB-C port, while the older ones use micro-USB. This means Android users can use any standard USB type C or micro-USB charger to charge their devices.

However, Apple iPhones do not work with Android phone chargers or rather USB type C or micro-USB. iPhones come with proprietary port that is not available for use on phones made by other manufacturers. This means that iPhones users cannot charge their phones with other company's chargers.

Apple introduced Lightning port in 2012.

Around 500 families live in the Sector 85 society

GURUGRAM: Residents of Orris Aster Court, a residential society located in Sector 85, have written to the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority ( GMDA ) seeking the construction of a 24m-wide road linking the area to the rest of the city. With the lack of a connecting road, about 500 families who shifted to the society four years ago are being forced to use an unmetalled village road which is in a poor condition and has no streetlights, residents said.

Though they have approached local leaders and civic agencies on the issue, no action has been taken yet, residents said.

“We wrote to GMDA on Friday and approached them regarding the connectivity issue that we have been facing for the last four years now. We have a temporary road, but don’t know how long we can use it. In November last year, the road was dug up by some unidentified miscreants. We had filed a police complaint and it was reopened later,” said Param Singh, a resident.

“We fear that the road will be blocked any moment as it is legally not meant for us. We have been assured by civic bodies that the problem will soon be fixed, but nothing has been done so far,” Singh added.

Another resident, Rakesh Kumar, added: “The sector is outside of Gurugram proper, which is why we don’t have a public transport system in place and have to depend on our own vehicles. We need good roads to commute. We don’t have metro connectivity, nor do city buses come here. How long can 500 families live without a link road?”

Residents also said the temporary road doesn’t have streetlights, as a result of which several instances of snatching and robbery have been reported on the stretch.

Meanwhile, GMDA officials said they are aware of the situation but there is no clarity on who should construct 24m-wide roads for societies.

“We do not have any role to play in this situation. There are no specific rules defining which authority should construct the road,” an official said.

212,['27/01/2020'],Haryana: Congress to launch drive for new members,"This story is from January 27, 2020

Kumari Selja

GURUGRAM: Haryana PCC chief Kumari Selja on Sunday said that Congress will launch a membership drive soon to expand and strengthen itself in the state.

Speaking to mediapersons at the party office in Kaman Sarai, Selja said that during its tenure, Congress had made ‘serious efforts’ for the country’s progress and succeeded to a great extent.

She attacked the BJP government, saying it had pushed back the country many decades. “This government has no right to stay in power. People must take an oath to dislodge them from power and bring Congress back,” said Selja.

Former minister Ajay Yadav, who accompanied Selja, said BJP had only brought in ‘anti-people’ policies, saying demonetisation, Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) were a ‘threat to democracy’.

Slamming the ‘divisive mindset’ of BJP leaders, Yadav alleged that they had also been trying to demolish the Congress party’s office in Gurugram . “But we will not let it happen. Instead, we will make people aware about the anti-people policies and make Congress stronger,” he said.

He said the BJP government wanted to divide people on the basis of caste and religion through CAA and NRC at the time when international bodies have called the move unconstitutional.

“Such acts have tarnished India’s democratic image at the international level. Not only this, the country will lose several thousands of crores of rupees at a time when it is going through its worse economic slowdown,” he said.

Many residents complained that the foul smell from the garbage makes it impossible to walk on the road.

GURUGRAM: Residents of Sector 62 have raised concerns about waste dumping on major roads of the sector. Both civic waste and construction and demolition waste has been dumped along main roads by both sanitation workers and locals for around a year now, they alleged.

Stray cattle, pigs and dogs can be seen swarming on waste dumped on a 400m stretch opposite a private school in particular, residents said. The sector has about 10,000 residents.

Many complained that the foul smell from the garbage makes it impossible to walk on the road. Pavithra S, a resident of Suncity, said civic authorities should be more accountable, especially when it comes to waste dumping near schools and hospitals.

“Every time I go to pick up my children from school, I have to pass the garbage dumps on the roadside. What sort of example are we setting for our future generations? They are taught rainwater harvesting and composting in schools, but the stark reality outside the school is a sharp contrast to the education they are receiving,” added the mother of two.

Suresh Rastogi, another resident, said RWAs of the area have been running from pillar to post for a resolution of the issue, but the problem persists.

“Everyone is aware of the issue at hand. We’ve approached GMDA and MCG, and complained on CM redress cell and on social media. Some of the waste is cleared one day, but the situation is back to square one in a few days. Some people from nearby shanties also dump their waste alongside the road. This road is not a designated dumping spot, yet we see sanitary workers disposing of waste here. The problem persists because the authorities pass the buck,” he added.

Residents said construction and demolition waste is also dumped at a number of sectors along Golf Course Road (Extension), including Sector 50 and sectors 62 to 67, adding to pollution in the area. “Construction debris is regularly dumped on the road adjacent to Conscient Heritage One residential society in Sector 62. This takes place in broad daylight, yet authorities have failed to take note of it, let alone take any action,” said Neeraj Nagpal, a resident.

MCG officials had earlier claimed that the construction waste plant in Basai would process such waste, but could not be reached for updates on the issue.

Amrapali Sapphire

NOIDA: The Supreme Court-appointed court receiver, R Venkatramani, on Sunday promised homebuyers that all pending work in of Amrapali Sapphire I will be completed within six months.

Venkatramani, visited the Sapphire I in Sector 45 on Republic Day and unfurled the tricolor. On the occasion, he told the buyers that he was there not on a person capacity, rather as the representative of the apex court.

Venkatramani assured the buyers that the work in the society, including construction of some flats and registrations, will be concluded in the next six months. “I am here to convey the sincere and path breaking decision taken by the Supreme Court to bring relief to Amrapali buyers. The resolution would be implemented as per a timeline of six months,” Venkatramani said.

According to the residents of Sapphire I, the project has 25 flats left to be completed, six lifts to be fixed, fire-fighting arrangements, repair of expansion joints, repair of seepage in shafts and power back-up systems. The total number of units at Sapphire I is 1,033.

“A fight started by a small group of Sapphire I residents against the builder is finally culminating with the Supreme Court order for registration and completion of Amrapali flats. It is a victory of the common man against builders with the support of Indian judiciary,” said Ravi Kant, Sapphire I resident.

While the tripartite agreement and registration of Sapphire residents has started, so far 56 buyers have got their flats registered. “On January 26, the presence of the Supreme Court receiver signifies the judiciary’s support for the buyers. It is a great day in our lives to see these flats getting registered and NBCC working for completion,” said Shekhar Sinha, a retired vice admiral and resident of Sapphire I.

Atraffic police contingent marches on the occassion of the 71st Republic Day as Noida police commissioner Alok... Read More

NOIDA: By the end of this week, those seeking an appointment with senior police officers can book slots online.

Gautam Budh Nagar police will introduce the online appointment system on its website. “This is meant specifically for those who have to come all the way from outside the district to meet senior police officers about progress of their cases,” said police commissioner Alok Kumar Singh. Appointments can be made for officers of the ACP rank and above. As of now, while people file complaints at various police stations, getting information about the progress of their cases can get very difficult. In many cases, securing an appointment with senior police officers can be time-consuming — especially for those who travel from places further away. The introduction of the online system, the commissioner said, could help make the process easier.

In a Republic Day address, minister Suresh Rana said with the introduction of the commissionerate in the district, there will be greater focus on smart policing and beat policing will be strengthened.

Under the beat policing system, a constable will be allocated a specific area and provided with a bike and other equipment to monitor the area. The first area where beat policing will be introduced is under the Bisrakh police station, a Gautam Budh Nagar police statement issued on Sunday said. Knowledge Park area, too, will have the beat policing system. The commissioner and other senior police officers held a meeting on the new system with constables from the two police stations.

Each constable will get a wireless, smart belt, wireless handset and a specific mobile number to stay in touch with senior police officers. “Batons and mobile numbers have been distributed to these constables and within a day or two, motorcycles will be given to them,” a senior police officer said.

Fifty bikes will be handed over to the constables in Bisrakh and Knowledge Park under this system and more police stations will be covered later. These 50 bikes are being provided to the constables as part of a CSR initiative by a private company. More companies will be involved later and funds will be sought from the government to provide these vehicles.

Representative image

GREATER NOIDA: A 24-year-old accountant was found murdered on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday on the premises of a mutt he had joined recently in Bisrakh area.

On January 21, Gururaj had joined the Noida branch of Karnataka-based Sri Adi Chunchanagiri Mahasamsthana Mutt, which is located inside BGS Vijnatham School.

Police said the cook at the mutt, Gopalnath, found Gururaj dead around 8.30 am inside his room. “I immediately informed Swamiji Anand Nath (the caretaker of the mutt),” the cook told the cops.

The night before his death, Gururaj, Gopalnath, Swami Anand and two of their helpers were inside the premises of the mutt, the cops said.

The accountant was found with serious head injuries, an officer said, adding that they found a bloodstained brick at the crime spot.

DCP (Central Noida) Harish Chander said: “Gururaj did not know Hindi. We are questioning Swami Anand Nath and another person in connection with the case.”

The police suspect the role of insiders as “there was no sign of forceful entry”. A senior officer said they have ruled out the loot angle because “all the belongings of the victim are intact”. The police said they are scanning CCTV footage from cameras installed at the main gates of the school. Additional DCP Ranvijay Singh said there are no cameras installed near the branch premises.

“There is a possibility of a conspiracy as the reason behind the crime,” a police officer said.

218,['27/01/2020'],Tamil Nadu: DMK's Trichy strongman K N Nehru is party's new principal secretary,"This story is from January 27, 2020

K N Nehru

CHENNAI: In a strategic move, the DMK has appointed Trichy south district secretary K N Nehru as its principal secretary, replacing T R Baalu . The change is said to be a reward for Nehru, the DMK's strongman in Trichy and Perambalur districts, where DMK won several seats in the panchayat and in the panchayat union elections held recently.

""As Baalu holds the parliamentary party leader's post, Nehru has been appointed principal secretary,"" DMK general secretary K Anbazhagan said in a statement published in the party mouthpiece Murasoli on Sunday.

An MLA representing Trichy west assembly constituency, Nehru was a minister in the 2006 DMK regime as well as two earlier regimes led by the party.

In the Lok Sabha elections held in May last year, Congress candidate S Thirunavukkarasar won in Trichy with a margin of 4.59 lakh votes with strong backing from Nehru. ""It is a reward from my leader (DMK president M K Stalin),"" Nehru told TOI over phone. ""Though I will be in Chennai, I will continue to fulfill my duties in Trichy and nearby districts,"" he said.

The Trichy party district will be further divided in the coming days, said Nehru. ""At present there are two party districts which will be divided into three with new district secretaries being appointed. We will continue to be strong in these districts,"" he said. ""Baalu is ok with the decision. It was decided a few months ago and a final decision was taken ahead of the DMK's executive committee meeting held last week,"" said a leader, seeking anonymity.

DMK's Tiruverumbur (Trichy district) MLA and youth wing deputy secretary Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi is said to be the frontrunner to take on the baton from Nehru. In the coming months, DMK is likely to see more senior leaders from the districts being brought to the headquarters.

""We may see a few more senior district secretaries like E V Velu (Tiruvannamalai) and K Ponmudi (Villurpuram), who have shown good results in their districts being promoted to the party headquarters' posts,"" said the DMK source.

221,['27/01/2020'],Anti-CAA protests by large number of Indian-Americans mar Republic Day celebrations in US,"This story is from January 27, 2020

Image via Twitter

WASHINGTON: India's 71st Republic day celebrations in the US on Sunday were marred by protests and marches, albeit peaceful ones, against recent changes in the citizenship law by large number of Indian Americans in various cities of the country.

Among Indian Americans, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, however, also had a fair share of its supporters who sought to counter protesters by asserting that “India cares for Neighbouring Minorities” and “CAA Won't Impact Indian Citizens.”

The supporters, however, appeared to be outnumbered by protesters, who held peaceful rallies and marches in various US cities, carrying anti-CAA banners and raising slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and demanding CAA's repeal and revocation of the proposed National Register for Citizens.

They raised the demand ruing that India's secular fabric is under threat.

In some of the cities, particularly New York, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta and San Francisco having Indian consulates, and at the Indian Embassy in Washington DC, the protestors shouted slogans like “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” and “Hindu, Muslim Sikh, Isai: Aapas Mein Saab Bhai Bhai”.

The protesters, however were countered by a number of Indian Americans who supported the enactment and congratulated the Modi Government for taking such a bold step.

The largest gathering of anti-CAA protestors was reported from Chicago where Indian Americans gathered in large numbers and formed several mile-long human chain. In the American capital of Washington DC, more than 500 Indian Americans marched from a park near the White House to the Gandhi Statue in front of the Indian Embassy.

The anti-CAA protests in at least 30 US cities were organized by recently formed Coalition to Stop Genocide, comprising several organizations like Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC), Equality Labs, Black Lives Matter (BLM), Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) and Hindus for Human Rights (HfHR).

“The brutal crackdown by government in India on anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests has created a situation in which women in large numbers have come out on streets to challenge the divisive-communal-fascist agenda of the government,"" Magsaysay Award winner Sandeep Pandey said, addressing a gathering in Washington DC.

“It gives hope that democracy and Constitution can ultimately be saved by the common people from a government which is bent upon destroying them,"" he said.

IAMC president Ahsan Khan said from the Bay Area in California, the rally of Indian Americans represents an extension of the massive unrest in India against the ruling BJP government for its relentless attacks against the secular Constitution.

""Indian Americans and people of conscience in the US are seeking accountability from the Hindu nationalist regime that wants to turn Indian Muslims into foreigners and render them stateless,” said Khan after the rally in San Francisco.

""Protests happening not only in India but around the world represent a global consensus against the draconian policies of the Modi-Shah government,"" said Dr Shaik Ubaid from New York.

“All Indians are equal citizens and that is the foundational social contract between the Indian nation and its citizens,"" said Minhaj Khan from New Jersey.

""Breaking this contract has grave implications for the future of India as a country,” he added.

At some of the places including Washington DC, pro-Khalistani supporters held separate protests against India.

GURUGRAM: The one multi-level parking (MLP) in the city having fallen into disuse, work beginning on three others — after 11 years — should have been welcome news.

Except all three are in Sadar Bazar, within 900m of each other, and could end up causing traffic congestion instead of easing it.

“There is no point to having three parking complexes so close to each other but with few access roads. The entire Old Delhi-Gurugram stretch is clogged because of illegal parking. There are other places which need to be cleared up. Why are they all in one locality?” asked Dhruv Singh, a resident of Palam Vihar.

There was a lot that didn’t work for the Sector 29 MLP — there was very little commercial activity nearby and few last-mile connectivity options to make the complex financially viable.

With that in mind, the three new MLPs have been planned as mixed-use ones. The Sadar Bazar area is a busy place with narrow lanes, lined with vehicles parked illegally on the roads. The idea was to decongest that. But streamlining traffic flow may need to factor in more.

“Thousands of vehicles will line up on the main road to get into the parking lots. It will get even more chaotic than it is now,” said S Velmurugan, senior principal scientist and former head of the traffic engineering and safety division of Central Road Research Institute.

To resolve this, he added, two things need to be done. “There should be multiple access roads to spread the traffic out. Availability of parking space and information about it need to be modernized. The conventional first come first serve system won’t do. Online booking and message boards displaying occupancy could streamline traffic. Most importantly, there has to be strict enforcement of no parking rules and restrictions on vehicle movement,” he said. Without this, he further said, these MLPs would fall into disuse the way other parking spaces in the city have.

Urban transport expert Sewa Ram said there needs to a dedicated traffic and market management policy. “Without a policy to streamline traffic and business operations in the area, the parking facility will not have much value. Streets need to be de-cluttered and pedestrian-friendly so people can access the stretch properly after parking,” he added.

In addition, there needs to be a thrust on mass transit. “Something like Chandni Chowk needs to be developed here. People shouldn’t have to depend on road transport to access the market. A tunnel road or elevated road for vehicles heading for the railway station could be explored,” Ram said.

The MCG said its plan is to provide enough parking space to the thousands of shop owners who have to park on the roadside now. “Once there is a dedicated space to accommodate these vehicles, things will be streamlined. We have asked the contractor to explore multiple access routes to avoid traffic converging on just one or two stretches,” a senior MCG official said.

GURUGRAM: The Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited (GMCBL) on Sunday added five more routes to its existing service to cater to the residents of new sectors.Responding to the demands from the new sector residents for bus routes in sectors 58-115, GMCBL came up with five new routes that were launched by state transport minister Mool Chand Sharma during the Republic Day celebrations in the city.The new routes include route 135 (from Sector-90 to IndusInd bank in Cyber City), route 242U (Gurugram bus stand-Farrukhnagar-Gurugram bus stand), route 122 (Sikanderpur metro station to Gurugram bus stand), route 111E (Vatika Chowk to Sector 55/56 metro station) and route 116E (Huda City Centre metro station to Railway station). Besides, route number 116E and 122, all other routes are going through the new sectors. (see map)According to the GMCBL officials, five buses will run on each of the newly launched routes and the number of buses might be eventually increased depending on the ridership.“These new routes have been created based on feedback from the residents and keeping in mind their mobility requirement,” said a GMCBL official.With the addition of these routes, GMCBL will be serving on a total of 18 routes with a fleet of 150 buses. According to the GMCBL website, the approximate ridership of the services are around 55,000 passengers per day. TOI had recently reported that a few new sector residents had visited newly appointed GMCBL chief Sonal Goel and requested her to run buses in the new sectors.The lack of public transport in these sectors has been a huge concern for the residents and the launch of the new routes, come as a big relief for the residents, especially as the metro routes will take another four years to be functional.“City bus service covering new sectors will be a big relief for us. We hope that these routes can be expanded in the future,” said Manoj Lakhani, a Sector 90 resident. Meanwhile, GMCBL is working on the approvals for the city bus route connecting Gurugram and Delhi which has been in the pipeline for a while now.The bus route is expected to connect Gurugram with Dhaula Kuan and Dwarka.“The route has already been approved by the chief minister during a GMDA meeting and we are just waiting for the interstate permit to run the bus,” said a GMCBL official.A route connecting Gurugram and Faridabad is also under process and is likely to be launched soon.",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73653176,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-493756,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/bus-service-to-cover-5-more-routes-three-in-new-sectors/articleshow/73644165.cms

Sharjeel Imam

PATNA: A joint team of Delhi, UP and Bihar police conducted raids on the ancestral house of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Sharjeel Imam at Kako in Jehanabad district of Bihar late on Saturday night after an arrest warrant was issued against him by Aligarh police in a sedition case. Imam, one of the organisers of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protest at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh, had allegedly made ""seditious"" statements in Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) by calling for cutting off Assam from the rest of India.

Jehanabad SP Maneesh told TOI on Sunday that raids were carried out in search of Imam at Kako Bazar but they could not arrest him. Apart from UP, cases have also been filed against Imam in Assam and Delhi for his January 16 provocative speeches at AMU, a video of which later went viral on social media. In the video, he is heard giving a clarion call to Muslims to cut off Assam from India at Chicken's Neck. Chicken's Neck, or the Siliguri corridor, is a narrow stretch of land of about 22km, located in West Bengal, that connects northeastern states to the rest of India. This corridor is inhabited largely by Muslims.

The SP admitted that some family members of Imam were quizzed. Sleuths of intelligence agencies also interrogated Imam's close relatives. A few of them have been detained as well, he said. ""We are cooperating with the police teams from outside the state in their investigation. There is no case pending against Imam here,"" the SP told TOI over phone.

Authoritative sources said the police team left for Patna where some relatives of Imam were living. ""Imam's immediate family members live in Patna. We can't share more information related to the ongoing investigation as it's a sensitive issue. Senior officials are monitoring the police operation,"" an officer posted at the police headquarters said.

Imam has stated on his official Facebook profile that he is from Patna and has done schooling from St. Xavier's High School here as well as from DPS-Vasant Kunj in New Delhi. Later he got admitted to IIT-Bombay, from where he did postgraduation in computer science. He also worked as IT programmer at the University of Copenhagen before coming to JNU, where he is a student in Centre for Historical Studies.

Meanwhile, another video of Imam has surfaced, in which he is heard asking people at a sit-in, reportedly in Gaya district of Bihar, to come out of villages and block national highways in a bid to cut off vehicular movement between states.

""...The remedy for our problems is forcing the government to agree to our demands... The first thing we did was to unite people. This step was important because Muslim people stopped coming out on the streets. Last time, we were seen in 1985 but we have not come out on streets thereafter, especially not in such large numbers. The second step will be to use the anger of Muslims by forcefully stopping vehicular movement by sitting on the streets and not getting up till this (citizenship) law is taken back,"" he is heard saying in the video, the authenticity of which TOI could not verify.

229,['27/01/2020'],Karnataka: Chaos within BJP as clamour grows for senior ministers to step down,"This story is from January 27, 2020

MYSURU: Away from the glitter of Republic Day celebrations, chaos reigned in the BJP as ministers came under pressure to step down to accommodate defectors who won on BJP tickets and party loyalists who are waiting in the wings.

During an event at Suttur Mutt on Sunday, chief minister BS Yediyurappa refused to answer questions on the issue, tersely saying: “I will not respond to questions on cabinet expansion.” However, at the event, Yediyurappa welcomed Chikkaballapura legislator D Sudhakar as a “future minister”, indicating at least one of the 11 turncoats who won is certain of a place in his cabinet.

Earlier, Sudhakar had dismissed the possibility of defeated candidates being made ministers, citing the Supreme Court verdict upholding their disqualification. “The Supreme Court gave clear directives while dealing with our petition and it has to be factored in,” he told reporters.

However, AH Vishwanath, one of the disqualified MLAs who lost and who is reportedly pushing for a cabinet berth, found support in Chamarajanagar BJP MP V Srinivas Prasad, who said all 17 rebel MLAs should find a place in the council of ministers. “I stand by what I had said earlier,” he said.

Meanwhile, BJP legislator and former Union minister Basanagouda Patil Yatnal said in Vijayapura that all those who enjoyed privileges of power earlier should now make a “sacrifice” for the sake of the party. Yatnal appeared to be targeting former CM, opposition leader and present industries minister Jagadish Shettar and former DyCM and legislative council opposition leader KS Eshwarappa, who is now the RDPR minister.

“Despite serving as a senior minister in the [Atal Bihari] Vajpayee government, I’ve given up ministerial aspirations,” Yatnal said. “I expect all those who previously enjoyed power including those who served as CM, DyCM and opposition leader to sacrifice their posts now. Sacrifice is not only for cadres but also for leaders who make speeches about it.”

In Tumakuru, law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy said he was prepared to resign if the party instructs him to do so. “I will happily vacate my cabinet berth to ensure a stable government,” he said, adding sarcastically that he will even resign from his MLA seat if asked.

But health minister B Sriramulu, in Chitradurga, sang a different tune saying all those commenting on resigning from posts were talking in their “personal capacity”. He evaded questions on resigning and instead suggested he continues to nurture hope of being elevated to DyCM. “Yes, people are demanding it [that he be made DyCM]. However, it is up to the central leadership and I will abide by whatever decision they take,” Sriramulu said.

Reports suggest Yediyurappa has sent a tentative list of about seven names from the disqualified lot, who won on party tickets, and another set of BJP loyalists to central leadership for approval.

The protests continued through wee hours on Monday with women raising slogans

MUMBAI: Hundreds of women have been sitting on a road in south Mumbai's Nagpada area since the January 26 night against the CAA-NRC-NPR regime, apparently drawing inspiration from New Delhi's Shaheen Bagh protest .

Holding placards and raising slogans against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register (NPR), the women sat down on the Morland road outside Arabia Hotel on Sunday late night.

Most of them are residents of Muslim-dominated Madanpura, Jhoola Maidan, Apripada, and Mumbai Central areas.

They have so far not withdrawn their agitation despite senior officers of the Mumbai Police urging them to do so, an official said on Monday morning.

The women protesters can be seen holding placards with slogans like ""We stand against CAA, NRC, NPR"", ""They tried to divide us, Respect my existence or expect my Resistance"" written on them.

Slogans hailing Hindu-Muslim unity and brotherhood were also raised.

Senior Nagpada police station inspector Shalini Sharma said she had requested the protesters to take a prior permission from the police, but the women refused to budge and continued to occupy the road.

In Delhi, thousands of people, including women and children, have been protesting since December 15 at Shaheen Bagh and nearby Jamia Millia Islamia against the CAA and the NRC.

NEW DELHI: For the second time in two years, the government has rolled out the process to sell Air India by inviting bids to sell its 100% stake in AI and AI Express and its 50% stake in the ground handling JV AI-SATS. Interested parties will need to submit their expression of interest (EOI) by 5 pm on March 17, 2020, and qualified bidders will be notified on March 31. However, the preliminary information memorandum (PIM) for this key strategic divestment says these dates may be subject to change.The combined debt of AI and AI Express is Rs 60,074 crore. Interested bidders (IB) will be expected to take over Rs 23,286 crore of this debt — all of which is debt for aircraft that they will be taking over as the transaction. The brand name Air India, and its associated terms, will need to be retained by successful bidders for a time period that will be mentioned in the request for proposal (RFP) to be issued after March 31.The iconic Nariman Point HQ in Mumbai and the corporate HQ in Delhi near Connaught Place are not part of this transaction and will remain with the government. Successful bidder will be allowed to use them during the transition period for a couple of years. “AI is in possession of various articles of arts, paintings, objects and artefacts. These are not a part of the proposed transaction,” the PIM states.Learning from the experience of the first unsuccessful bid, the key changes made this time are: Offering to sell 100% government take in AI and AI Express, instead of 76% earlier. This change gives complete operational freedom to the new owner.Secondly, last time the bidders were expected to take over debt of Rs 24,576 crore and current liabilities of Rs 8,816 crore — a combine figure of Rs 33,392 crore.This time the debt expected to be taken over has been reduced by almost a third to Rs 23,286, crore all of which is backed by aircraft part of the transaction. The principle this time has been to make current assets equal to current liabilities for bidders. The entire working capital and other non-aircraft debt will be retained by the government.The transaction advisor is Ernst & Young LLP India.“Any private/public limited company, limited liability partnership, body corporate, whether registered or incorporated in India or outside India; or Fund; in each case which is eligible to invest under the laws of India (subject to such parties obtaining applicable statutory approvals) either as a sole bidder or as part of a Consortium are eligible to participate,” it says. The interested bidder, whether a sole bidder or a consortium, should have a minimum net worth of Rs 3,500 crore. Net worth of each participating member in a consortium should be at least Rs 350 crore (10% of Rs 3,500 crore).If a schedule Indian carrier is a member of such a consortia with its equity shareholding in the consortia upto 51%, the minimum net worth criteria will not apply.Except IndiGo, all other scuffle Indian airlines have a negative net worth. “The negative net worth of a member, only if it is a scheduled airline operator in India, would be considered as nil. However, the remaining members of the consortium in this case will have to meet the minimum financial capability” criteria it says. Foreign airlines will need to meet the net worth criteria.With 121 aircraft in its fleet (not including the 4 Boeing 747s that will be retained with the government with an AI subsidiary not being sold for VIP use), AI’s debt as on March 31, 2019, was Rs 58,282.9 crore, with contingent liabilities of another Rs 3,178 crore. AI has 13,629 employees (permanent and fix term contracts) with wage arrears of Rs 1,383.7 crore and a provision has been made in AI books for Rs 207-crore arrears for narrow body fleet employees.With 25 Boeing 737s in its fleet, AI Express has Rs 1,791 crore of debt.The PIM states in Q2 FY 2019-20, AI and AI Express’ combined share of international air travel to and from India is at 50.64% (among Indian carriers) and18.4% on an overall basis (considering both Indian and foreign airlines); and within India is 12.72%.In Video: Air India sell off: Centre offers 100% stake for sale",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73651814,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-189748,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-to-sell-100-per-cent-stake-in-air-india-issues-bid-document/articleshow/73651820.cms

Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa

MYSURU: Chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday refused to field questions on the state’s finances, merely saying his budget on March 5 will do the talking. The question came in the wake of Siddaramaiah , leader of the opposition, claiming recently that the state’s coffers were dry and its finances were in the doldrums.

However, Yediyurappa insisted the state’s finances were sound and it will be better once promises made by the business community during his trip to Davos turn into concrete investment.

“I will present the budget for 2020-21 on March 5. People will then know about the state’s financial position,” Yediyurappa said during a visit to Suttur Mutt on Sunday. “I will answer Siddaramaiah’s comments during the forthcoming budget session of the state legislature. The Davos meet I attended will benefit the state immensely. It will bring huge investments that will promote industry and agriculture growth and various job-generation activities.”

In their plea, the aspiring candidates have also demanded an enquiry on the manner the candidates were dealt with by the election officer. The candidates alleged that the officer allowed chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inside the election office out of turn.

Their plea urges the court to issue directions to poll panel to give them time to file their nomination papers again and also seeks a probe on the mode and manner the candidates were dealt with by the election office.

It further seeks appropriate guidelines to facilitate the smooth filing of the nomination papers by all candidates from all walks of Indian society.

The plea argues that the grounds of rejection of the nomination papers are ""flimsy non germane"".

The 11 petitioners told the court that in the wake of their democratic mind and a collective decision under a movement ""Chaloo Chunaav Laade"", they decided to individually contest the polls against the sitting chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and others.

LUCKNOW: There were surprises galore for home side Awadhe Warriors on Republic Day as they conceded an unassailable 0-4 lead to Hyderabad Hunters with the rubber just three match old at BBD Badminton Academy .

It turned out to be a Super Sunday for the visitors as Vladimir Ivanov and Sikki Reddy upstaged the Awadhe Warriors’ ‘trump’ mixed doubles match against Shin Baek Cheol and Christina Pedersen 15-12, 15-14.

The hosts made the cardinal error of changing the pairing and going out all new. In the previous match against North East Warriors, KS Hyun and Christina Pedersen played and won. Ivanov and Reddy cashed on it to turn the tables on the Warriors. A win in the ‘trump’ match gives two points, and a loss takes away two points.

After Sourabh Verma had earned the opening point for Hyderabad by overcoming Subhankar Dey 14-15, 15-12, 15-10, the defeat of Cheol and Pedersen meant Tanvi Lad had to defeat PV Sindhu to keep the side afloat. But Sindhu was in good form to win 15-8, 15-8 to seal the tie in favour of Hyderabad Hunters.

BENGALURU: The Lokayukta appears to have taken on far more than it can handle with its decision to scrutinise assets of every elected public representative from panchayat members up.Until August last year, the anti-corruption body had only members of the legislature in its sights, but it expanded its ambit by ordering even corporators and panchayat members to submit a list of their assets and liabilities.However, five months on, a majority of the affidavits submitted by the 1.3 lakh public representatives in the state are yet to be processed. Reason: The Lokayukta is short of hands to follow-up on these affidavits and identify lacunae, if any.“With 1.3 lakh public representatives, it is a very laborious task,” said an official in the Lokayukta office. “We need a dedicated team to process correspondence and verify affidavits.

Besides, the Lokayukta also faces a crisis in filling posts of additional registrars.

We can proceed further only if there is sanction.”But sources say the government is dragging its feet since recruiting more personnel will only increase the burden on the state exchequer.Incidentally, the Lokayukta’s office recently sent two MLAs showcause notices over discrepancies in affidavits they had filed.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73652144,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-265108,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-manpower-crunch-hits-lokayukta-hard/articleshow/73652038.cms

Nick Kyrgios and Rafael Nadal. (Getty Images)

MELBOURNE: It's not quite loveall in the Rafael Nadal versus Nick Kyrgios Oz Open fourthround match-up, but the Aussie maybe softening his aggressive stand. And just as well because no one likes a target better than the world No. 1.

Kyrgios reckoned the 19-time major winner was ‘hell of a tennis player', but he has never hung out with the 33-year-old Spaniard and doesn't quite know him. ""I'm super excited, playing one of the greatest tennis players on centre court at your own Slam, it's pretty cool. I'm looking forward to it. That's why you play, I guess,” he said.

Nadal might lead the headto-head 4-3, but the Aussie is in front on outdoor hardcourts --2-1. ""Ever since the juniors, I enjoyed playing lefties. I feel like I kind of know what game plan I need to bring to be successful against them,” the 24-year-old said. ""Rafa is a different beast altogether. I kind of know his patterns. Federer knows his patterns. Everyone knows his patterns, can't do anything about it. He executes them at the highest level.”

In their sixth meeting in Acapulco last year, Kyrgios saved six breakpoints and three match points. He even sent down an underarm serve that appeared to have rattled the Spaniard. ""He lacks respect for the public, the rival and towards himself,” Nadal later said of Kyrgios. The Aussie promptly took to social media, posting, ""Don't doubt yourself, there are plenty of people who will do that for you. I can smell blood when I play this dude"".

Kyrgios attempted to put it all in perspective. ""At the end of the day, we're two different tennis players. We go about it completely different,"" he said. ""After Wimbledon, beaten by the better player. I shook his hand, looked him in the eye and said, too good. Even if we don't like each other, there's a layer of respect. He's one of the greatest of all time. I also read that he thinks I'm good for the sport. There's a layer of respect that we both have for each other. Doesn't necessarily mean we like each other. We're going to go out there and give contrasting styles and personalities.""

Djokovic junior holds fort

Novak Djokovic's two children — Stefan and Tara — five and two years in age, are already swinging the tennis racket. The tiny tots have the blessings of their parents – 32-year-old Djokovic and wife Jelena.

""I'm giving Stefan all the time and space that he needs in the world. I really want him and my daughter to express honest desire to take the racket and the ball and go to the court or just hit against a wall,"" Djokovic said. ""I like them to be active. They are active. They're trying different things.""

The Serb, winner of 16 major titles, pointed out that Stefan also enjoys martial arts and football. ""He likes to play (tennis) with me and with his best friend. He doesn't like to play with too many other people.""

Asked who Stefan's favourite player was, Djokovic said: ""He still hasn't expressed who his favourite is. I'm working on becoming his favourite player.""

249,['27/01/2020'],"Tracing 2,000-year-old Tamil footprint in southeast Asia","This story is from January 27, 2020

The Mariamman temple in Singapore, one of the oldest Hindu temples in the country

CHENNAI: Although the Tamil diaspora is rich, the history of Tamils in connection with those countries is yet to be studied in detail. Keeping this in mind, two Singapore-based institutions jointly documented an account of the 2,000-year-old history of the Tamils in Singapore and the other Southeast Asian countries.

The connection between Tamil Nadu and the lands across the Bay of Bengal speak of one of the most penetrating soft power projections in the world and yet that tale has largely been ignored. ""The sense of history among ancient Tamils is different from that of the Greeks or the Chinese. They clearly lack written records meeting conventional standards of historiography, especially those dictated by European scholars,"" said Arun Mahizhnan who with Nalina Gopal documented the history.

Tamil classical literature, dating from 300BC to AD300, is rich with fascinating details and insights. ""There are countless stone inscriptions, copper plates and palm leaves that record at least some aspects of life in ancient times. Some of these literary and lithographic references relate to Tamils in Southeast Asia . They provide a reasonably reliable evidence of the past,"" he said. Both Arun and Nalina were in the city to speak about the challenges they faced during documentation of the project.

Titled 'In sojourners to settlers', the first volume traces Tamil connections, settlements and influences in the Southeast Asia, especially in the pre-modern era. The second focuses on Singapore and relates the journey of Tamils from sojourners to settlers. Maritime links between south India and Southeast Asia date to the late prehistoric period. ""Tamils acted as intermediaries in a trade network from the Roman empire and the Mediterranean in the west to the other side of the Bay of Bengal. By the early centuries (AD), pre-modern Tamil diasporas including seafarers and traders travelling to littoral areas in Southeast Asian polities had become common,"" said Nalina Gopal.

Epigraphic and archaeological finds that attest to the early presence of Tamils in Southeast Asia include 10 medieval Tamil inscriptions, coins, Indo-Roman Rouletted pottery, ceramics, beads, and bronze artefacts. ""The oldest inscription in the Tamil language dates to the 2nd or 3rd century AD on a potsherd found at Phu Khao Thong in south Thailand bearing the word 'turavon', meaning ascetic,"" she said. While the 3rd century AD touchstone inscription of a perumpattan or Tamil goldsmith, from Khuan Luk Pat in Krabi Province points to the presence of pre-modern professional diasporas, the Takua Pa inscription points to the presence of a Tamil mercantile guild in the 8th-9th century AD.

""The Sangam anthologies contain the earliest literary references to Tamil contact with Southeast Asia. The Pattinappalai, dating to the 2nd century AD, describes the import of foreign merchandise from Kedah to the Chola port of Poompuhar, while Chithalai Satthanar's Manimekalai written in the 5th-6th century AD alludes to Java,"" said Arun.

Though Tamils have been traversing the Bay of Bengal and its hinterlands for some 2,000 years, most of them were sojourners. ""They came, they saw, they acquired but most of them went back home.

256,['27/01/2020'],Australian Open: Federer takes Fucsovics in his stride; Sandgren shock for Fognini,"This story is from January 27, 2020

Roger Federer. (Getty Images)

MELBOURNE: Roger Federer started slowly, but made up for lost time by breaking early in the final three sets of his Australian Open fourth-round clash against Marton Fucsovics .

The superstar Swiss, playing his first tournament of the new year, has looked rusty in patches this week, tennis and temperament, but he did well to pick the spots and open the court with his range of designer shots on a nippy evening, when the temperatures dropped and the ball travelled slowly through the air.

Federer won 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 against the heavy-hitting Hungarian, who in a bid to push the pace left gaping holes in the court. In their previous two meetings, the 27-year-old hadn’t taken a set of the Swiss. Federer, the six-time champion here, moved into his 15th quarterfinals at Melbourne Park to take sole ownership of the all-time record of most last-eight appearances. The 38-yearold, who has given longevity a new name, is also in a staggering 57th Grand Slam quarterfinal.

Federer, dressed in a striking shade of plum, was on court for over four-hours in his third-round match against Aussie John Millman, coming back from the dead in the deciding super-tiebreak. He carried strains of that encounter onto court on Sunday, Australia Day.

“It was a tough start for me, I thought Marton played well and clean,” the father-of-four said. “I struggled early in the match, the Millman match had taken away my confidence (for some) and I was beat from baseline. Then when the temperatures drop and it is cool like this, the conditions become really slow. I just had to take my chances after that. It was good that I able to recover after the Millman match, I feel better and I’m going to feel better with every match from here.”

The 20-time major winner plays American Tennys Sandgren, who shocked 12th seeded Fabio Fognini 7-6 (7-5), 7-5, 6-7 (2-7), 6-4 in 3 hours and 27 minutes in a match that had as many run ins and arguments as it had rallies.

Federer said he was looking forward to play Sandgren for the first time. “I’ve played a lot of tennis, but never against Tennys,” Federer said.

Sandgren put out the unpredictable Italian, who like the Melbourne weather can have all four seasons in an hour, for the second time on a major stage, after his third-round victory at Wimbledon six months ago. The 28-year-old American also improved to 5-2 against top-20 opposition in major competition. Fognini often flirts with the lines, on court and conduct, while it works wonderfully for his tennis, he was given a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct by chair Damien Dumusois, which led to an exchange that brought supervisor Gerry Armstrong on court. Fognini then received a medical timeout to tape his blistered finger.

Shortly after the Italian was granted a bathroom break which led Sandgren to tell off Dumusois. “He doesn’t get new rules because he’s Fabio, or does he?” the American asked before adding, “If you are wondering why players think some players get treated differently, I think you shouldn’t.”

“Between the first set and the second set, I didn’t know what was going on. There were some breaks, it seemed like we were dragging on for no real reason,” said Sandgren, who won 15 points in a row after Fognini had his fingers taped. “His play dropped a little to start the second set. It wasn’t just my good play as to why I got up 4-0. It’s a rollercoaster sometimes with him. You’re just a passenger. He doesn’t play well, all of a sudden he’s playing amazing, you’re stuck with your hands in your pockets. Shoot! I’d like to play tennis too.”

Sandgren embraced the opportunity of playing Federer in his second time in the last eight here. “It would be incredibly special to be able to play him at least once in my career. To play him on a big stage like the quarters of a Slam would be a ton of fun really,” the American said.

Djokovic, Kvitova advance

In other men’s matches, defending champion Novak Djokovic eased into the quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win over Argentina’s Diego Schwatzman, the 14thseed. Djokovic, the second seed, will play Canada’s Milos Raonic, who moved past Croat Marin Cilic 6-4, 6-3, 7-5.

In women’s fourth-round matches, seventh-seeded Czech Petra Kvitova beat Greek Maria Sakkari, the 22ndseed, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3, 6-2. The Czech will play the top-seeded Aussie Ashleigh Barty who put out American Alison Riske, the 18th-seed, 6-3, 1-6, 6-4. Tunisia’s Ons Jabeur made her first Grand Slam quarterfinal, when she overcame Chinese Qiang Wang, the 27th-seed, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1; Jabeur will take on another first timer in the last eight American Sofia Kenin, the 14th-seed, who beat Coco Gauff, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-0.

JAIPUR: “In Delhi, the BJP will not win assembly elections. Why? The reason is that it is the wisdom of the voters and you can’t blame money and muscle. The wisdom of the people , which prevails over everything,” said deputy CM of Rajasthan Sachin Pilot, while attacking BJP during a session “The Democracy Index” held on the fourth day of Jaipur Literature Festival here on Sunday.

Referring to the influence of money, muscle and media in elections, Pilot made a point that people did not vote for BJP in Maharashtra and Jharkhand assembly polls concluded recently. “Ultimately, it is the individual who presses the button. It is the people who elect their leaders,” said Pilot, who felt that informed citizen can minimize the role of influencers.

Responding to the culture of rising intolerance in the country, Pilot said that country’s tradition, culture, history and democracy is fairly strong to withstand any destruction. “The political landscape will not remain the same forever. Everyone has to promote the culture of keeping a check on those who are accountable,” said Pilot.

Countering the allegation of him being a beneficiary of dynasty politics, Pilot responded by stating, “I have worked tirelessly in the state as a Congress chief for my workers to feel proud of me for the last six years. I have got Congress back in power not because of my father or my grandfather.”

He drew an analogy from cricket to further explain the limited role of dynastic politics in shaping anybody's career and said, “Just like in cricket if you don’t play well you are bowled. Similarly, if you don’t deliver on the expectations of people as a political leader you won’t last. Gone are the days when just being the nephew or niece of someone was enough. You can get elected, may be once, but second time if you don’t perform, you can’t win,” said Pilot.

Raising hopes that the quality of leadership will improve in the country, Pilot said that I have been travelling across the length and breadth of Rajasthan to see the young guns at the age 20-21 contesting elections of Sarpanch, which was not the case 25 years ago. “I am 42; I have been in public life for about 20 years. Our role is to keep developing leadership and groom the next line of leadership. It will be unwise if I don’t do so,” said Pilot.

BENGALURU: Over the past two months, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) slapped notices on 495 apartments in BBMP's Mahadevapura zone, imposing a fine of Rs 291 crore as 'environmental compensation' charges for violating prescribed standards in treating sewage discharge.With KSPCB threatening to take action if the fines aren't paid within 15 days of receipt of notice and officials talking of disconnecting water supply, the apartments, a few of which have been fined several crores of rupees, are crying foul.Members of the affected apartment associations said KSPCB issued multiple notices to them between December 2019 and January 2020, seeking Rs 5,000 to Rs 3 crore as environmental compensation charges. TOI accessed several of these notices, a majority of which were issued to apartments in Bellandur and Whitefield.The KSPCB notice to Brigade Metropolis in Mahadevapura read: ""As per the analysis report, the parameters viz., chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen and fecal coliform are not meeting the stipulated standards (sic)."" Brigade Metropolis has been directed to pay Rs 5,735 as sample collection and analysis charges.CBR Akriti apartment in Hoodi Circle was slapped a fine of Rs 3 crore for not having a sewage treatment plant (STP). Residents of the apartment, in their reply to KSPCB, however, stated, ""Our apartment was constructed before 2016 and is validly connected to the underground sewage network (UGD) which is operated by the BWSSB.""According to Bangalore Sewerage (Amendment) Regulations, 2018, buildings constructed prior to January 19, 2016 and connected to BWSSB underground drainage network are exempt from setting up STPs, unless they have violated provisions related to environment impact assessment.Members of KSPCB, however, said penal action was being taken in pursuance of a National Green Tribunal (NGT) order of December 2019 to prevent discharge of pollutants into Bellandur, Agara and Varthur lakes.The NGT order, however, said if works related to setting up of STPs and laying of sewerage network aren't completed before September 20, 2020, Rs 10 lakh compensation will be levied on erring PCB officers, while from February 1, 2020, apartments discharging sewage/effluents into lakes will be required to pay a compensation of Rs 5 lakh per month.Residents of apartments that have been slapped with steep fines, meanwhile, pointed out that KSPCB collected water samples without their knowledge. They say KSPCB started harassing them by issuing multiple notices without having collected a 'legal sample'.HA Nagaraja Rao, president, Bangalore Apartments' Federation, said KSPCB recently started issuing notices to many apartments across Bengaluru, claiming they had taken treated water samples many months ago.""They then purportedly created reports, which state the samples aren't compliant with prevailing norms. We wonder how these reports came to be, when samples weren't even collected in quite a few cases,"" Rao maintained.He pointed out that apartments themselves were engaging a certified lab to test the quality of STP-treated water.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73652995,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-125590,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-495-apartments-told-to-pay-rs-291-crore-fine-over-sewage/articleshow/73652925.cms

MANGALURU: Senior politician and JD(S) leader K Amarnath Shetty passed away at a hospital at Mangaluru in the Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka on Monday. He was 80. He was survived by his wife and two children.

Amarnath Shetty was admitted to AJ Hospital due to age-related complications a couple of days back. Hailing from Moodbidri , about 55 kms from here, his rise in political field was phenomenal.

Known as upright and decent politician, he entered politics from grassroots level in 1965 by becoming the president of Paladka gram panchayat, Karkala taluk. Later he became the president of Moodabidri TMC. He was elected from Moodbidri assembly constituency thrice in 1983, 1987 and 1994. He held posts of tourism, religious endowment, youth affairs and sports, ports and labour minister during the Janata Dal (Secular) regime when Ramakrishna Hegde and J H Patel were chief ministers.

After losing to his Congress opponent K Abhayachandra twice in a row, he declined to contest in the last Assembly polls. He had contested ten times from the Moodbidri Assembly segment.

Born in the Mundrudeguthu Family of Paladka to Kanthappa Shetty and Rathnavathi couple in the year 1940, Shetty was basically an agriculturist but displayed his leadership skills early by entering into active politics by the age of 25. His leadership skills saw him enter politics through Samstha Congress. He later joined Janata Party, where he remained till his end with the split faction of JD(S). He held the post of senior vice president of the party’s state unit till his last days.

Not only in politics, Shetty was active in social work in the field of education, social service and cooperative sector.

Mourning his death, Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa recalled him as a simple and honest politician. D Veerendra Heggade, Dharmadhikari of Dharmasthala also mourned his death saying he has lost a good friend with his passing away. He stated even while Shetty did not have power or position, he was seen working for the welfare of the people.

BJP state President Nalin Kumar Kateel said that in his death the people of the coast have lost a great leader who had strived for the welfare of the people from the grassroots level.a row. Bantavara Alias Nadavar Mathr Sangha has also mourned the death of the leader.

JD(S) national president H D Deve Gowda visited the family of Shetty at Moodbidri and offered his condolences. Sources said former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy may not be able to come for the final rites to be held on Tuesday as he was busy with programmes at Channapatna, but may come for the ceremony to be held on the eleventh or the thirteenth day.

A good night's sleep can actually be good for your skin, which is now backed by scientists. A new study by Nature Cell Biology shed light on how a good night rest can be good for your skin.The study was conducted on mice and their collagen. It was found out that the sleep phase can regulate the extracellular matrix, which provides structural support to cells in the form of connective tissue like bone, skin, cartilage, etc. Half of our body is made of matrix and half of it is collagen.The study discovered that collagen is made of two types of structure. One is a thicker form, which is fully formed by the age of 17. It remains the same for the rest of our lives and is permanent. The second type is the thinner structure, which breaks down under stress. The study found out that these structures can actually repair itself while we rest at night.The thinner fibres protect the permanent structures from the daily wear and tear on the skin cells.""If you imagine the bricks in the walls of a room as the permanent part,"" says lead author Karl Kadler, B.Sc., Ph.D., ""the paint on the walls could be seen as the sacrificial part which needs to be replenished every so often.""Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body. It provides the glow and improves skin's elasticity and strength.

""I’ve never been much of a sports fan but Kobe Bryant was a hero to me and it was his words and way of thinking and living that lifted me up during times where I felt like I couldn’t get off the ground. When I was 16 and going through what felt like an excruciatingly painful period in my life, I first saw Kobe’s MUSE documentary, and the mamba mentality is the only thing got me through every single performance. He was fighting inner demons, and so was I, and the way he used them to fuel his game on the court made me feel like I could use them to fuel me onstage. At my weakest moments I would channel a different person like he did, because when I felt broken and lost offstage, he taught me how to use my own pain, he taught me how to access strength I didn’t know I had, because on my worst days, I thought of Kobe and suddenly I could do things I didn’t think I could do. I watched every interview, I read every quote of his, and I wish that he knew how many times he saved me, how many times he helped me access a champion in myself that I couldn’t have seen on my own, how many times he helped me use my own demons, how many times he taught me how to use pain to make me a better person, how many times he taught me by example about life by the way he carried himself and the way he saw things.... and I never got the chance to tell him this in person. I’ve watched only two basketball games in my life, but what Kobe did for me changed the course of my life. I can’t imagine how many people he did this for. His legacy will live on in the lives and minds and souls that he touched, he made his mark not only in the game, but in humanity itself. He is a hero to me forever.

I was not wearing a seat belt and ended up getting several stitches. Back in India, I have had a difficult time due to absence of seat belts,” he said.Upon his return to Pune, he observed that drivers are rash. Many of the cabs, he saw, did not have a seat belt for the rear passenger. “In case the driver breaks when he/she is riding at a speed of 50 kmph, it is certain that the passenger will feel the jolt and may end up hurting their head on impact,” he said.These concerns were continuously raised with Uber, officials of which returned the call after a few weeks, saying, all the cars would have rear seat belts soon.Latkar has started urging his friends to intervene in case a car does not have seat belts. They are asked to give a low rating or told to demand a refund for taking the safety lightly.Drivers, however, are finding it a tad bit difficult to comply with the, who drives an Uber cab, said that not all passengers demand seat belts.Moreover, his car did not have them pre-attached. “The regional managers keep asking us the reason behind not having the belts. Our busy schedule does not allow us to spend a lot of time over fixing belts. If this is made mandatory I will get it done immediately,” he said.Another driveradded, “I had these rear seatbelts in my cab but had to detach them during servicing. I understand that it will act as a shield during the accident and will get it done soon.”One of the regional heads from Uber’s Pune office confirmed to having received Latkar’s requests. “We have communicated it to the drivers. They will have to fix belts on the rear seats to avoid accidents/injuries passengers,” the official said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-360455,msid-73621880/73621880.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/techie-rallies-for-rear-belts-in-cabs/articleshow/73653569.cms

As AMC school board celebrates its centenary this year, eminent citizens recollect how teachers who were invested in their students’ future had a great impact on their livesMunicipalBoard is celebrating its centenary this year. Though municipal schools these days often come under severe criticism for the quality of education and drop-out rates, it remains a fact that they have shaped the lives of many who would not have been able to afford a private education.Some of the eminent citizens who are products of municipal schools of Ahmedabad include Additional Chief Secretary (Agriculture and Farmers’) Punamchand Parmar, GCERT advisor Yogendra Vyas, former MP Harin Pathak, former joint secretary at Social Justice and Empowerment Department Chandresh Rajpal and others.Manilal Patel, 90, former principal of Chharanagar Buniyadi Municipal School, is remembered by his students as someone who came home to rebuke them if they skipped school.“I worked hard to infuse enthusiasm for learning among the students. I would cycle to their homes and remindwhy it was important for a child to go to school. It wasn’t easy for me to convince them about how powerful a weapon education was. I worked two years consistently on it and the results started showing.”Patel even went on to learn the language of the Chhara community to reach out to them. “I dedicated my life to teaching because despite being a brilliant student I could not make it to a good post as my parents passed away when I was very young. I am glad my students remember me,” he says.“Teachers today complain when they work overtime. That never used to be the case during my days. People from economically weaker backgrounds want their children to get good education and teachers must do all they can to realise their dreams,” he adds.Though he has never received an award for best-teaching practices, he takes pride in having taught students who have gone on to do well in life. “That alone is my award,” he says.Lila More, former English teacher at Maninagar Marathi Shala No 1, remembers those days when teachers enjoyed immense respect and parents put faith in them. “Students will only learn if they are taught with love and affection. If you ask a student what their favourite subject in school was, the teacher who taught the subject would also be their favourite one. Teaching for me was a passion; not just a means of earning money,” she says.AMCSB Chairman Dhirendra Singh Tomar said unlike earlier times when municipal school teachers were required to be Class 10/PTC pass, today the teachers require a master’s degree. “I believe the school will show results if students attend classes regularly, pay attention to what is being taught and study well,” he said.AMCSB recently felicitated former students who have excelled in life and held important positions in their profession.Reminiscing the days spent in the classrooms, they spoke of love and kindness of committed teachers who taught them that ‘if they could dream it, they could achieve it’.Each of the former students has an interesting story to share, the kind that will inspire awe in you and reinstate your belief in the ‘nothing is impossible’ theory. Read on.♦ Additional Chief Secretary, (Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare)Age: 59School: Rajpur School no 2 in Class 1&2 andRajpur School No 5 for classes 3 to 7Happy and full of enthusiasm to enter the class of Meenaben on fi rst day of school, Parmar went and sat on the fi rst bench when the roll call began. The students would shout, ‘Jai Hind’, to mark their presence. He eagerly awaited for his name to be called out so he too could respond with a ‘Jai Hind’ but that did not happen for a couple of months since his name was missing from the attendance register.“And then on July 28, 1965, my favourite teacher called out my name for the fi rst time register. “And then on July 28, 1965, my favourite teacher called out my name for the first time during attendance. And I shouted a ‘Jai Hind’ with all the energy I could gather,” he says, picking out the date from his memory.It is after his best friend Raman began going to school that Parmar asked his father to enrol him too, but the latter did not pay much attention. However, he managed to convince his father who got relative Narayanbhai to take him to the principal of Rajpur Shala Number 2. Parmar was initially denied admission as he was not yet 5, but he was unrelenting.“We went again the next day and told the principal that I wanted to study. Looking at my keenness, he agreed. He allowed me to sit in Meenaben’s class but without registering me,” recalls Parmar.Parmar credits his school with nurturing in him the ability to think independently. “The stories of Arjuna and the bird’s eye, Gandhiji’s Ram naam, Sravan’s devotion to his parents had a profound impact on me. At home, I also had mother who made me read the Mahabharata, the Bhagwad Gita and the Ramayana. Learning and imbibing became a way of life,” he says.Among the teachers he remembers fondly are Pradipbhai, his teacher from class 4, and Amrutbhai, his class 6-7 teacher. “I was a rough diamond. They polished me,” he says.Parmar’s family lived in an urban slum. His parents were Gandhians and worked in a textile mill. His father was also a member of Majoor Mahajan Sangh till 1984 when the mills closed down. His mother supported the family in running the house. It was in 1982 that he topped the GPSC exam at the young age of 22. He became an IRS in 1984 and an IAS in 1985. “I thank all my teachers for making me who I am today. I am proud of my municipal school education and will remain indebted to everyone who mentored me,” he says.DESIGNATION: Former central ministerfor Home, Defence and PersonnelSCHOOL: Khadia shaala no -4THEREwere several teachers in his family, so the children were all academically inclined. He studied for a year at a municipal school in Khadia. Pathak recollects how his Maths teachers were strict and getting sums wrong meant risking a beating. Strict rules, however, worked for him, he says. “I ensured I delved into the subjects I learnt so I could prepare without rote learning.The skills I picked up in school helped me with preparing the budget and presenting it,” he says, adding, “The municipal school celebrated gurushishya parampara.The teachers played a big role in shaping our personality, encouraging us to be curious and be dedicated to the work we take up. They themselves were so committed that we did not have to look anywhere else for inspiration.”DESIGNATION: Advocate at City CivilSessions CourtSCHOOL: Chharanagar Buniyadi Municipal SchoolHIS father worked as a mason, while mother was a housewife. He recalls how his principal Manibhai Patel took rounds on the cycle during school hours to catch students who has skipped classes to play games. “These teachers at times used to give us a bath to keep us clean.,”he reminisces, adding, “Our Math teacher Gordhan Patel taught us so well – the tables, fractions, divisions, multiplications, additions and subtractions that I till date hardly make any mathematical mistakes. Our English teacher Chandni Prajapati would teach us English for free after school hours. Such teachers are hard to find today.” His principal is 94 but still visits him at times on a cycle.DESIGNATION: MBBS doctor at RajpurHirpur General HospitalKanya VidyalayMERCHANT’S mother wove clothes at Gandhi Ashram while his father worked as a labourer. He recalls, “We were economically deprived and I went to school in a torn halfpant one day. I wore it for 5-6 days. On the seventh day, my teacher called me and gifted me a new half-pant. She asked my parents not to send me to torn pants to school and promised to manage things for me if they did not have money. It was a touching gesture.”He said, “The syllabus was always completed on time. There was never any bias against any student.They used to engage us in outdoor sports activities and encouraged us to participate in different competitions. They were very affectionate, loving and kind.”DESIGNATION: Former joint secretary (Social Justice and Empowerment)SCHOOL: Kankaria Shala no 5 and 6ASK him what he liked the most about his school, pat comes the reply: “The seven Samurais; my teachers Madhuben, Lakshmiben, Leelaben, Jayaben, Leelavatiben, Bhanuben and Ganpatbhai.” Son of a mill worker father and a housewife mother, he knew that the only ticket to a good life was studies. And he loved going to school where cleanliness was “a big thing”.The school enforced strict discipline and students were encouraged to be part of scouts and guides. “I am good at arithmetic because of my municipal school education. They had so many interesting ways to teach us multiplication tables. If we did not understand something, they would repeat it and ensure we got the basics right. I liked arithmetic so much tha t I went on to study Statistics and aced at it,” he says.DESIGNATION: Senior personal secretary to CCI-T1SCHOOL: Maninagar Marathi Shala no 1PARATE’S parents were government employees. Though they could afford a private school, they put their kids in civic school for a formal education in Marathi, their mother tongue. Parate, a gold medallist in English literature, attributes her good handwriting and mathematical skills to her teachers, she remembers them as hard working, loving and “invested in teaching”. She left municipal school after class 8, but the life lessons she learnt there continues to guide her even today.“From dance to sports to studies, they always focused on overall development. Our English teacher Lila More used to ensure that the weakest among the students learnt the spellings right. And they never got bored of teaching us.”DESIGNATION: GCERT advisor and visiting faculty at SPIPA for IAS probationersSCHOOL: Dariapur Shala no 2HIS parents always emphasised on education; his father had completed matriculation and insisted on good schooling. Vyas still remembers his first day at school.“My mother had come to drop me to school on the first day. All of five, I had a shaved head with a tuft of hair sticking out. My teacher Prasannaben, a widow, too had shaved her head. I think that is what made me connect with her instantly.She was caring and I loved her story telling sessions,” he said. He credits his achievements to Mokabhai, his class 3 teacher who had a knack of teaching kids by employing fun methods.“There was no rote learning. I learnt to read, calculate and question things because of him,” he says, adding, “I think teachers’ salaries must be connected with students results, otherwise the situation will not improve.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-100446,msid-73620451/73620451.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/municipal-schools-get-a-for-shaping-their-future/articleshow/73653633.cms

M K Stalin

CHENNAI: Opposition leader and DMK president M K Stalin on Sunday demanded that the Centre and state governments scrap the hydrocarbon extraction projects , which he said will turn the delta districts into deserts.

He called on party workers and farmers to participate in larger numbers for a massive protest against the project at five delta districts - Thanjavur, Pudukottai, Cuddalore, Nagapattinam and of Tiruvarur.

""The BJP-led Central government had recently exempted oil and gas companies from getting environmental clearance. It is very clear that their aim is to turn the Cauvery delta into a hydro carbon extraction zone,""he said.

He said as the Vedanta group was a major contractor in the hydrocarbon project, the ruling AIADMK government would do nothing to stop the project. ""It is now all in the hands of DMK workers and other opposition party leaders and workers to stay united and save the Cauvery basin,"" Stalin said

Stalin said chief minister Edapaddi K Palaniswami 's letter to Prime Minister Narendra modi on the recent notification of exemptions given to oil and gas companies was merely an eyewash.

He said during the last eight years of the AIADMK regime more than 5 lakh acres of kuruvai cultivation in the Cauvery delta had been affected. DMK is striving hard to fix the loss of the farmers by pressing the state government to completely waive agriculture loans, he said.

290,['27/01/2020'],Coronavirus disease harder to contain than SARS: All you need to know about difference between Coronavirus and SARS,"How is Coronavirus different from SARS?

The new virus has created alarm because much about it is still unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. Unlike SARS, new virus infectious in its incubation period, which can range from 1 day to 14 days, making it harder to contain. This was not the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) making the new coronavirus harder to contain. At a press briefing in Beijing on Sunday, the head of China's disease control agency, Gao Fu, said it was ""not as powerful as SARS,"" but officials warned it could be getting stronger. How fast is the virus spreading?

China says the virus is mutating and can be transmitted through human contact. Two scientific analyses of the epidemic say each person infected is passing the disease on to between two and three other people. By Sunday, the pneumonia situation had resulted in a total of 80 deaths, while 51 people had recovered and 5,794 remained as suspected patients, state-run Xinhua news agency said. Almost all provinces in China except Tibet have reported the virus cases. During the past 24 hours, 769 new confirmed cases, 3,806 new suspected cases and 24 deaths from the disease were reported. The condition of 461 people being treated for the virus was termed as ""critical"". A total of 32,799 close contacts have been traced, the commission said, adding 30,453 among them were currently under medical observation while 583 others were discharged on Sunday. The mayor of the Hubei province capital Wuhan, which has emerged as the epicentre of the epidemic outbreak, said he expects another 1,000 new patients in the city, A high power committee on Sunday said the virus' ability to spread was getting stronger. Is the Chinese government doing enough to stem the outbreak?

Compared to the very low bar set by the Chinese leadership’s secrecy and inaction during the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003, Xi has responded with speed and alacrity to the latest health emergency. But there are also signs that the government, especially at the regional level in Hubei province, the source of the outbreak, was slow to recognize the danger and is continuing to mishandle the crisis. Some public health experts have asked whether the sweeping travel restrictions that have been imposed are leaving people without access to medical care, while many Chinese remain unconvinced the government is being completely forthcoming about the toll of the disease. Even as officials in Wuhan said nothing publicly, government scientists shared information with the World Health Organization on the last day of 2019, isolated the virus and posted details about it on an international database 10 days later. There is evidence, too, that local authorities kept a lid on the crisis in the first days of January so as not to upset the cheerful tone for a provincial legislative session that is a highlight of the local political cycle. How many countries are affected by the Coronavirus till now?

In addition, 17 confirmed cases were reported in Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and Taiwan, besides eight in Hong Kong, five in Macao and four in Taiwan. Overseas, confirmed cases included seven in Thailand, four each in Australia and Singapore, three each in the United States, the Republic of Korea, Japan, France and Malaysia, two in Vietnam and one in Nepal. What are the governments around the world doing to stall the outbreak?

Three research teams have begun work on developing potential vaccines, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations said. Scientists hope to be testing the first possible vaccines in three months time. China is testing the HIV drug Aluvia as a treatment. On Sunday, China temporarily banned nationwide the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms. Wild and poached animals packed together in markets are blamed as incubators for viruses to evolve and jump the species barrier to humans. There are severe travel restrictions in Wuhan, with urban transport shut and outgoing flights suspended. China will halt all group tours, affecting tourism both at home and to other countries, from January 27. Hong Kong has barred residents of Hubei province from entering the city. France, Italy, Japan, Australia and the United States have all said they are working to evacuate citizens from Wuhan. Airports around the world have stepped up screening.

Dhrubo Banerjee’s next ‘ Golondaaz ’ has already created a ripple on social media and why not! Tolly superstar Dev will be seen as Nagendra Prasad Sarbadhikari , the forgotten hero who is known to be the father of Indian football.Fans are keeping their fingers crossed about any update from the project and on Sunday, celebrating the Republic Day, the first-look motion poster from ‘Golondaaz’ was launched. The poster looks every bit intriguing and it will surely raise the excitement bar among football-crazy Bengalis.“I have been trying to rediscover the lost pride in Bengalis. People know about the Bengali renaissance but are not aware of the contribution of this man. He is completely forgotten. My film is not a biopic but a means of creating a movie based on Nagendra and the times. Every Bengali must know about him. The present generation does not know much about Sarbadhikary, how he introduced the game and popularized it among Bengalis. My movie will weave the tale with references from real-life events,” commenting on his film earlier an excited Dhrubo Banerjee had said.The director is also pretty much impressed to see Dev’s eagerness while practicing the game with former Indian football team captain Bhaichung Bhutia for the film.This film will also mark Dev’s return to SVF after the 2017 blockbuster ‘Amazon Obhijaan’. For years, they have ruled the commercial space of Bengali cinema and now the hit jodi is set to weave magic yet again. Interestingly, Dev has never been part of a football movie.Nagendra Prasad Sarbadhikari was the founder of many sports clubs in Kolkata in the 1880s, including the famous Sovabazar Club which, an iconic sports institution of that era.Besides Dev in the titular role, the film has an ensemble cast including Anirban Bhattacharya Ishaa Saha , Indrashish Ray, Srikanta Acharya and John Bhattacharya in pivotal roles.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73654264,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-234938/73654264.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/bengali/movies/news/golondaaz-motion-poster-creates-a-buzz/articleshow/73654279.cms

293,['27/01/2020'],AP Legislative Council: Andhra Pradesh cabinet clears resolution to abolish Andhra Legislative Council,"This story is from January 27, 2020

YS Jaganmohan Reddy

AMARAVATI: The Andhra Pradesh assembly on Monday passed the statutory resolution to abolish the Legislative Council with 133-0 votes on Monday.

The speaker announced that the House adopted the resolution with prescribed majority. After a day-long debate in the assembly, the speaker took up the voting on the issue and passed the resolution.

Speaking on the resolution, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy said that the YSR Congress Party-led government has decided to abolish the bill keeping the peoples’ interests in mind.

He said that people's interests are paramount for the party than its political interests. He expressed serious anguish over the developments in the Legislative Council. The chief minister observed that the government was proud to move the resolution as it found no use of the existence of the council.

He said that there was no point in having a council which was creating hurdles to make laws by the legislators elected by the people.

He said that the council chairman’s decision to refer the important bills passed by the assembly to the select committee had pained him and many legislators.

Reddy said that it was not mandatory for the state to have legislative council as only six states in the country had two Houses.

He said that the Upper House was created through a law made by the assembly to give advices on key issues. He said that the council was set up to bring some intellectuals who could provide more insight into the bills.

“Surprisingly, the Legislative Council in the state had become a big impediment to implement the people's agenda. People gave mandate to the legislators elected by them to make laws in their interest. We might need to give a serious thought whether to continue this council if the council continues to block the bills passed by the assembly,” the chief minister said amidst thundering applause by the members.

He said that the present assembly had enough number of intellectuals including professors, doctors, engineers, IT professionals, journalists, farmers and actors.

He said that the government has been working for the uplift of the people for the past seven months. He said that it has brought some revolutionary lagislations to empower the underprivileged sections.

He wondered that the council was used even to stall the bills like introduction of English medium in government schools and creation of separate commissions for SCs and STs.

“Those who are talking big about Telugu medium in the council are not sending their children to Telugu medium schools. Chandrababu Naidu will defend the English medium in assembly and encourage his members in the council to stall the bill. How should we understood these conspiracies?” asked the chief minister.

He said that he was unable to understand as to what was the trouble for the TDP members if the government set up separate commissions for SCs and STs. “We trusted that council would really help us making better laws. The council had shattered our trust,” said the chief minister.

He said that the Opposition leader in the assembly stayed in the council gallery for hours together only to influence the chairman and breach the rules. He said that chairman had clearly violated the rules by referring the bills to the select committee.

“The chairman himself said that it was against the rules. Still, he took the decision. It is like committing a murder despite knowing that it is crime,” the chief minister fumed.

Earlier in the day, the state cabinet chaired by Jaganmohan had passed a resolution to abolish the Legislative Council. The resolution was subsequently moved in the assembly. After holding consultations with the legal experts, ministers, legislators and senior functionaries of the party, the chief minister had decided to go ahead with the move.

The chief minister took the decision to abolish the council after receiving the setback in the Upper House which referred the three-capital cities bill and CRDA repeal bill to the select committee.

The chief minister had dropped enough hints on going for dissolution of the council in the assembly on Thursday.

He said that expenditure of nearly Rs 60 crore per year and Rs 300 crore during the five-year tenure on the council would be a waste if the council continues to block the bills passed by the assembly.

The resolution will be sent to the Centre seeking introduction of a bill to dissolve the Upper House.

306,['27/01/2020'],U-19 World Cup: Battle of wrist spinners as India start favourites against Australia in quarter-finals,"This story is from January 27, 2020

Getty Images.

POTCHEFSTROOM (SOUTH AFRICA): Indian wrist spinner Ravi Bishnoi 's repertoire of skills will meet a match in Australian Tanveer Sangha's variations in a face-off between two talented tweakers during the quarter-final of the ICC U-19 World Cup on Tuesday.

The white ball cricket in recent times has seen wrist spinners emerge as an important cog and junior cricket is no different where Bishnoi, easily the tournament's most impactful bowler, would like to give his team the advantage over the Australian side.

With 10 wickets from three games and game-changing 4 for 30 against a gritty New Zealand side, Bishnoi has proved why Kings XI Punjab has invested Rs 2 crore on him during the auction.

Statistically, even Sangha has been at his best with 10 wickets with 5 for 14 against minnows Nigeria. But there's been a four-wicket haul against the West Indies and a wicket to show against England for the player of Indian origin.

On Tuesday, both the wrist spinners will be key to their team's chances and Australia will look to improve their dismal record against India at the junior level.

In the last five U-19 encounters since 2013 (different teams have played though), India have won four with one game being abandoned due to rain.

As a team, India are way ahead both in terms of quality as well as temperament with the likes of Yashasvi Jaiswal (two half-centuries), his opening partner Divyansh Saxena and skipper Priyam Garg showing glimpses of their talent.

In the bowling department, lanky UP boy Kartik Tyagi, who breaches the 140 kmph barrier quite regularly, and left-arm seamer Akash Singh, moving the white ball back into the right-handers, are a heady combination.

And there is left-arm spinner Atharva Ankolekar , who came back brilliantly against the Junior Black Caps despite being attacked early on. He got three crucial breakthroughs but a finger fracture in his right hand could be an impediment while fielding.

While Jaiswal, Garg, NT Tilak Verma and Saxena make India's batting look strong, Australia skipper Mckenzie Harvey (nephew of former Australian all-rounder Ian Harvey) is a tough customer with the bat as he showed with an innings of 65 against England in their final group game.

Then there is Conor Sully, who bowls brisk medium pace and also has the ability to use the long handle to good effect.

Anti-CAA protests interrupted Indian Republic Day celebrations in some US cities (Pic: Twitter)

WASHINGTON: Pro-Pakistani elements have infiltrated the anti-CAA protests in the US to execute their hidden agenda against India, an Indian-American community leader has said.

During a recent protest against the CAA in Washington DC, posters were seen reflective of the presence of pro-Pakistani elements.

Not only this, at least two Pakistani-Americans were among the main organisers of the anti-CAA protests in Washington DC on Sunday, claimed Indian-American community leader Adapa Prasad.

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) came into force in India last December amid protests in India and around the world.

The Indian government has stressed that the new Act does not deny any citizenship rights but has been brought in to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries and provide them citizenship.

""Darakshan Raja, a Pakistani-American activist who also co-ordinates Kashmiri separatist protests in Washington DC area along with another Pakistani-American Muslim activist named Khudai Tanveer, were one of the main coordinators of the anti-CAA protests,"" Prasad told PTI.

Prasad and his team shared videos and pictures of the individuals from the anti-CAA protests in Washington DC, which was attended by more than 500 Indian-Americans from in and around the city.

Prasad said one of the posters written in Urdu said “Hans ke Liya hai Pakistan, Larr ke lengey Hindustan”.

""This in English means we easily got Pakistan, now we will fight out to get India,"" he said as he shared the picture of the said poster.

""This is disgusting. Pro-ISI and pro-Pakistani elements are using this protest to execute their hidden agenda which is depicted in their own poster,"" Prasad said.

He said the protests are also being misused by pro-Khalistani activists to push their agenda.

""Arjun Sethi, a pro Khalistani activist, was also amongst the coordinators of the anti-CAA rally,"" Prasad said.

Sethi had recently testified before a Congressional Committee on Kashmir.

In recent weeks, some of the Indian-Americans, during private conversation in WhatsApp groups, had expressed apprehensions that their anti-CAA protests could be misused by elements close to ISI and Pakistan.

Young artists livened up the proceedings with folk dances

Models depicting international landmarks such as Statue of Liberty in New York, Westminster in London and Burj Al Arab in Dubai on a float on the Marina promenade grabbed the attention of visitors. A delegation led by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had visited the cities last year to attract industrial investments for the state.

A total of 16 tableaus of 15 state government departments were showcased on Kamarajar Salai. The social welfare department displayed a live marriage with a young couple in traditional wedding dress greeting visitors in a hall and a ‘valaikappu’ ceremony – both exhibits highlighting schemes and programme rolled out by the department.

The agriculture and horticulture departments showed a range of fruits harvested in the state. While the police department’s float had the exclusive patrol car for women security and highlighted the ongoing drive to fit CCTV cameras, the department of co-operation brought farmers and engaged them in cultivation, live. A demo model on organ donation was part of the department of health and family welfare’s float.

Floats were decked up with portraits of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa while deputy chief minister O Panneerselavam also featured in a couple of tableaus.

'Mumbai 24 Hours' policy came into force from the January 26 midnight. (File photo)

MUMBAI: The much-touted Mumbai nightlife experiment received a tepid response on the first night of its implementation on Sunday, primarily due to the lack of awareness about the new regime.

Cleared by the state cabinet on January 22, the ' Mumbai 24 Hours ' policy allows shops, eateries and theatres in malls and mill compounds located in non-residential areas to remain open round-the-clock.

The policy came into force from the January 26 midnight.

In upscale Nariman Point and Worli areas, several shopping malls remained closed during the night.

However, state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, who is the prime mover behind the Mumbai 24x7 initiative, sounded optimistic.

""It would gather pace in the coming weeks when people will start realising that it is safe for them to come out late night and enjoy,"" Thackeray told reporters late night when asked about several shopping malls remaining shut in the night.

He said a huge response to the move on the very first night was anyway not expected.

Sources attributed the tepid response to little awareness about the overall concept and the services that are covered under it.

Thackeray said, ""The shops complying with safety and waste processing norms are being allowed to operate under the nightlife policy"".

He reiterated that Mumbai is safe for all and it will remain so.

As per the policy, keeping shops, malls and eateries open in the night is optional and not mandatory.

Explaining the rationale behind the need of such policy, Thackeray had said on Wednesday that Mumbai is a ""24x7 functional city"" where people who work in night shifts and the tourists in transit need to have access to food in late hours.

The bars, permit rooms and pubs are currently excluded from the purview of the policy.

316,['27/01/2020'],"Karnataka: Course change delights nurses, but some services may suffer","Representative image

a

BENGALURU: The Indian Nursing Council’s recent decision to phase out a diploma course for would-be nurses from the academic year 2021-22, replacing it with a longer, existing degree programme, has touched off a debate among various stakeholders.The nurses’ community in Karnataka has welcomed the move to stop admissions to the three-year general nursing midwifery (GNM) diploma and make the four-year BSc nursing programme the only point of entry into the profession. This, they say, will improve the quality of personnel training to be nurses, lead to better wages, and open up more opportunities. GNM pass-outs currently earn less than BSc ones in government and private hospitals, and they are not preferred by recruiters abroad as GNM is not perceived as graduation.Health service providers and government officials see things differently. They contend that the Council’s steps will lead to an oversupply of highly skilled nurses, who may start seeing certain roles as too low profile or less rewarding. This, in turn, will cause a shortage of home and geriatric caregivers, especially in rural areas, and make these services expensive.An estimated 3,215 GNM nursing schools in India have produced 1.2 lakh every year. Karnataka has 800 such schools, which admit 60 students in each batch. Nearly 48,000 nurses with these diplomas enter the industry each year in the state. Students from non-science backgrounds could enrol in GNM.The GNM admissions this year will be the last ones. From the next academic year, 2021-22, the said schools cannot enrol any students in this programme. These seats will be converted to BSc nursing, according to the Council’s directive to all states.The circular, issued in September 2019, instructs states and their local nursing councils to ensure no new GNM schools are approved. Inspections to renew, restart or enhance seats under the course must also stop.Karnataka has been the most vocal critic of the Council’s decision. In fact, to offset any potential adverse effects of the change, it is considering introducing a short-term nursing course.“The GNM programme is being phased out, and as a minister of medical education, I am very surprised. Those who complete four-year BSc nursing studies won’t go to serve in villages or work in branches like geriatrics. Courses like GNM are important,” said deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan, who holds the medical education portfolio. “The decision-makers in the Council have perhaps not thought about these aspects. No qualification should become a dead end.”But nurses’ associations say the change, from diploma to degree programme, will be a morale and wage booster. “Nurses have faced huge disparities because of the existence of different courses. At government facilities, the designations and salaries of GNM and BSc nurses are not same even though they fall in the same cadre. The pay gap is wider in the private sector, where nearly 90% of the opportunities lie,” said Girijamba Devi, secretary, Trained Nurses Association.The entry-level salary for a nurse with a GNM certificate is about Rs 8,000. The same for a BSc nurse is Rs 12,000.“In the name of cheap labour, nurses are being exploited. This is the reason we have been fighting for a single entry level in the profession,” Devi said.Industry experts fear there will be a glut of well-qualified candidates, which will cause problems for the industry and patients. “Many patients who pay for home healthcare services need stabilisation care for recovery and rehabilitation. It’s not a very challenging task, but it’s an essential one nevertheless. Phasing out of the GNM course will lead to over-skilling of candidates,” said Meena Ganesh, cofounder and CEO, Portea Medical, a prominent home health service provider.Home services involve multiple levels of care and not every patient needs a highly skilled nurse, according to Meena, a member of Vision Group for healthcare in Karnataka.“Some patients do require high level of care, for which BSc nursing candidates are available. But the same level of tending is not necessary for persons who need wound dressing, catheter procedure or injections. Ensuring availability of highly qualified nurses for these obligations will be a challenge,” she said.The Indian Nursing Council administered the general nursing midwifery course. BSc courses in Karnataka fall under the purview of the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS).Lakshmi Devi N, dean of nursing at the university, said the number of BSc nursing seats in Karnataka would climb to nearly 70,000 by 2021-22 because of the Council’s decision to convert GNM seats, and the varsity might struggle to handle so many enrolments.“Also, we will have to introduce a bridge course for students from non-science backgrounds in the first year to familiarise them with basic science,” she said.Currently, BSc nursing seats are offered to only science students after II PUC or class 12. After the GNM phaseout, these seats will be also available to commerce and arts students.Prashant Narayan, the general secretary of United Nurses’ Association, Karnataka, said candidates from such streams should not be allowed in nursing. “Nursing is a science course. Are non-science graduates allowed to pursue MBBS, BDS or pharmacy degrees? Then why should they be admitted to a nursing course? Only some states like Karnataka permit it, but many others, including Kerala, don’t,” he said.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73655382,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-242417,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-course-change-delights-nurses-but-some-services-may-suffer/articleshow/73655363.cms

File photo of Hindustan Aeronautical Limited (HAL) airport

BENGALURU: Ever since Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), 30km away from Bengaluru city, was opened, multiple attempts have been made to relaunch Hindustan Aeronautical Limited (HAL) airport, but to no avail.

Huge traffic snarls has frequently hindered flyers from easily accessing KIA and the government has made repeated efforts to reopen HAL for at least domestic and short-haul flights. The most recent of these meetings was held between the three stakeholders — BIAL, HAL and the government — two months ago.

Sources say the two airports do not see “eye-to-eye purely for economic reasons”. Sources say while BIAL is worried over a “dip in revenue collection”, HAL is allegedly more interested in commercial possibilities from operating a fullfledged airport.

“Neither is willing to consider woes of the common man,” said a government official who attended the meeting. “The government is trying to bring them on the same page, but the road ahead is a long one.”

Another official said, “BIAL’s concessionaire agreement runs till 2033 and it’s not willing to budge. It is also concerned over a drop in user development fee should a second airport be opened.”

HAL officials confirmed the meeting, but did not divulge details. BIAL did not respond to queries from TOI.

330,['27/01/2020'],4 tips to deal with grief after a miscarriage,"FacebookTwitterPintrest

Miscarriage or loss of pregnancy is a common occurrence around the globe. According to official data, about 10 to 20 per cent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. It can be due to genetic problems, infection, hormonal issues, uterine abnormalities, age or other underlying medical conditions.For most of us, miscarriage is nothing more than the loss of an embryo or fetus, but for the mother, it is more than just physical loss. It has a deep impact on her mind, which leads to emotional trauma and guilt. No matter how much you try to brush the feeling aside, it does not go away that easily.Transpersonal Regression Therapist Dr Gaurav Deka says that most of the time we try to cover up the situation and avoid discussion on miscarriage thinking that it might bring more pain to the grieving mother, but in reality, it does more harm than good. Moreover, the family starts pressurising the woman to try for the next child, believing that the arrival of the new member will heal everything. But by doing this they are actually not giving the woman any time to grieve.Dr Deka says that grieving is important for any individual who has suffered loss or has gone through a traumatic situation and the same applies to miscarriages. Not giving a sufficient amount of time to the mother to mourn the loss of her unborn baby will actually have a negative impact on her mental health, which will reflect even after the arrival of the next baby.He explained that there are five stages of grief. Each one has its own importance and helps the person to accept the harsh reality. It is important to let a person go through all the stages of grief to help them move ahead in life.Denial & Isolation: The first stage of grief is denial or isolation where people refuse to accept the truth that something like this has happened with them. The world around them become meaningless and they become numb. Denial or isolation is a natural thing, which helps a person to cope up with the emotional trauma.: The second stage of the healing process is anger. Their emotions come out in the form of anger. They feel angry with themselves, with the people around them and even the society for their loss.: Bargaining is the third phase, where the person starts to bargain for their happiness. They believe that when the next child will come, they will be happy or they will do a particular thing when they will have a baby.: In the fourth phase, the person goes into depression and go down low, refuse to meet people or communicate with anyone. They even feel lethargic and find it difficult to focus on their work. They lose the excitement, the joy and the enthusiasm to live or do their daily work.: The last phase is acceptance, where they finally move on the greiving phase, accept the fact and start living with it.Dr Deka reveals four ways to deal with the grief after miscarraige, which can help a person move ahead in life and start afresh.: Acknowledge the fact that you have lost a child and it is alright to talk about it. Communication is a powerful tool, which can help to deal with any complex situation. Allow the mother to express her feelings and be considerate towards it.: Grieving is equally important. Even if takes a week, a month or a year, allow them to mourn for the loss of their baby. If the grieving is not complete, the women remain stuck in that time and space, which reflect later in their life.: You can also involve a third person or seek a professional's help to cope up with the situation. Accepting the fact that you have lost a baby in front of a third person really helps.: Performing a small ritual like lighting a candle, giving clothes to the poor or floating a leaf in the river can help you move ahead in life. Rituals give you a sense of completion and closure.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73611446,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-426559/73611446.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/parenting/getting-pregnant/4-tips-to-deal-with-grief-after-a-miscarriage/articleshow/73611442.cms

On an average 1.5 tonnes of cocoon is auctioned daily at the government cocoon market in the city

COIMBATORE: The demand for cocoon is still high, despite its production going up by 20% in the past five years in the district, according to the Coimbatore sericulture centre.

On an average 1.5 tonnes of cocoon is auctioned daily at the government cocoon market in the city. ""About 20 to 25 farmers sell their cocoon at the market. At times, the production goes up to 3.5 tonnes a day. Yet, the demand for cocoon has not been met,"" said an official with the district sericulture centre. In Coimbatore, cocoon is produced at Annur, Narasipuram and Thondamuthur.

The state usually comes up with new targets every year, but this year the production target has been increased to 400 tonnes and the centre had met 75% of target, the official said

The silkworm rearing cycle is 28 days and farmers can earn on a monthly basis. But due to lack of awareness, official said, many farmers were not taking up the rearing process. Even though the quantity of silk thread produced from bivoltine silk cocoons is lesser than that of crossbreed yellow cocoons, most farmers produce bivoltine cocoons because of their ability to reflect the colour after dyeing. About 700m-900m of thread can be obtained from a cocoon and a kilogram of cocoon, he said.

""Until a decade ago, worms were prone to diseases and survival rate was low. A certain temperature had to be maintained, and the worms had to be fed four times a day. But, now the rearing process is not complicated at all,"" the official sad.

With the introduction of Chokki Rearing Centres, where worms would be reared till it attains stage 2 before handing it over to the farmers, the process has become simple, the official said, the state also gives subsidies for setting up of shed, plantation and installing drip irrigation.

Image credit: Hockey India.

AUCKLAND: The Indian women's hockey team lost 1-2 to New Zealand in its second match of the ongoing tour on Monday.

The Indians had earlier defeated New Zealand Development squad 4-0 in the opening match of the tour.

New Zealand started the game on an attacking note and earned a penalty corner early in the first quarter and the chance was brilliantly converted by Megan Hull in the third minute of the match.

India drew parity when young Salima Tete converted a penalty corner in the dying minutes of the first quarter.

The visitors matched New Zealand in the second and third quarters but a defensive error in the final 15 minutes cost India dearly as they concede a penalty stroke, and Megan Hull made no mistake from the spot.

India's chief coach Sjoerd Marijne was disappointed with the result.

""We created enough scoring opportunities but we were not productive enough. New Zealand were very successful in the little changes they got. They executed them well,"" he said.

""It is not about how many opportunities you create but how effective you are. New Zealand were stronger today and in the beginning we were struggling with that. But after the first quarter, we played much better.

""We created eight shots on goal and four penalty corners. We are definitely working on being more effective in the coming matches,"" he added.

India will again take on New Zealand in the third match of the tour on Wednesday.

348,['27/01/2020'],What is Shiv Bhojan scheme: Here is all you need to know about Maharashtra government's Shiv Bhojan scheme,"What is the 'Shiv Bhojan' scheme?

Under the scheme, which was launched on a pilot basis, thalis or lunch plates would be available to people at designated centres/ canteens during a stipulated time in all the districts. The 'thali' consists of two chapatis, one vegetable, rice and dal. The thalis would be available for people between 12 noon and 2 pm, officials said, adding that each canteen is going to serve at least 500 thalis (plates) per day. ""Initially, 50 'Shiv Bhojan' outlets will be set up for people where full meals will be available at Rs 10. We will expand the number of such outlets phase-wise depending on feedback,"" CM Uddhav Thackeray had told the legislative assembly. What is the cost of Thali?

The state government is expected to incur an expenditure of Rs 6.4 crore for the pilot 'Shiv Bhojan' thali project that will run for three months. Even though the customer will have to pay just Rs 10 per thali, the actual cost of the food will be Rs 50 each in urban centres and Rs 35 in rural areas. The balance amount will be given as grant to the district collectorate, according to officials. Why has the government introduced this scheme?

Launching of the scheme was one of the poll promises made by the Shiv Sena, which shares power with the NCP and Congress in a coalition government. ""The goal of the scheme is to provide affordable and quality food to all, irrespective of caste, creed, religion and financial status,"" tweeted Aaditya Thackeray, after the inauguration of the centre. Where all in Maharashtra is the scheme implemented?

Under the pilot scheme, at least one 'Shiv Bhojan' canteen has been started at district headquarters. A similar centre was unveiled by tourism minister and Mumbai suburban district guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray at the collector's office in Bandra. Guardian ministers of Pune and Nashik, Ajit Pawar and Chhagan Bhujbal, formally launched the scheme in their respective districts. Is this the first instance of a subsidised canteen in the country?

In the past, similar canteens have been started in Tamil Nadu — Amma Unavagam and Karnataka — Indira Canteen . In Tamil Nadu, the first canteen was set up in 2013 in Chennai. The literal translation of the scheme Amma Unavagam is ""mother's canteen"". (Amma also refers to late AIADMK chief J. Jayalalithaa). The canteens are set up by municipal corporations to sell subsidised food at a very low price. The Congress-led government of Karnataka started the canteen scheme in 2017. The food is served at civic wards of districts and taluka places of Karnataka. Last year in December, the BJP government in the state, much to the dismay of the Congress, announced that Indira canteens will be renamed as 'Maharshi Valmiki Anna Kutira'.

351,['27/01/2020'],D-Towners express their desh bhakti ki bhavna through movies & music,"‘PATRIOTISM AS AN EMOTION ALWAYS WORKS AND IT’S A GREAT UNIFIER’

‘NO BETTER MEDIUM THAN MUSIC TO EVOKE PATRIOTISM’

While movies and music have always played a pivotal role when it comes to evoking the patriotic josh in Indian audiences, the narrative has never been so strong in Bollywood as it has been in recent times. The popularity of the dialogue “How’s the josh?” from Uri: The Surgical Strike across the nation was a revelation, and even other films like Raazi, Mission Mangal and Batla House, apart from achieving BO success, have made patriotism a truly popular emotion amongst the audience. Closer home, our regional entertainment industry has also been voicing its patriotic emotions through films and music. Albeit subtly, the desh bhakti ki bhavna has been prevalent in Dhollywood as well. There might have been fewer Gujarati films that have been outright patriotic, but several filmmakers have given their films a patriotic twist with sub-plots and story deviations, which make the viewers feel proud of our country. Gujarati musicians, on the other hand, have been more active on this front, releasing singles that celebrate the spirit of India and our unique culture. As we celebrated Republic Day recently, D-Towners share why patriotic films and music easily strike a connect with the audience.Films have a lasting impact on the psyche of the audience and they not only have the potential to be BO churners, but also evoke a sense of togetherness. And just like several Bollywood filmmakers have used patriotism well, DTown films have also tapped this emotion to good effect. While films like IMA Gujju and Pagalpanti were high on combating terror, films like Diya…The Wonder Girl have taken a dig at social evils. “Patriotism is an emotion that is inherent in all of us, and it just comes out when we watch patriotic films,” says Sunny Pancholi, who starred in IMA Gujju. He adds, “They make us feel good about our country and give us a moment of celebration. And patriotic films have done really well in recent times, which reinforces the fact that they are a really good medium to connect with your audience.”Gujarati singers and composers feel that music is one of the most powerful mediums to express themselves and share an emotion that strikes a common thread with listeners belonging to all age-groups. Both music and patriotism act as great unifiers, feels singer Aishwarya Majmudar, who recently released a patriotic song for this year’s Republic Day. She says, “Be it patriotic films or songs, these are reminders that above all, we are Indians and despite all our differences, we are one. And just like patriotism unites us all as Indians, music also acts as a unifier. And when you combine both, it’s a beautiful medium for music lovers.” Unlike films, songs are more freely available, thus making them even more accessible. The audience looks for occasion specific songs to celebrate the emotions related to special occasions like the Republic Day and when a song is released during that time, it finds an instant connect. Says music composer Parth Bharat Thakkar , “Be it Republic Day or Independence Day, patriotism becomes the popular emotion and people tune in to songs that evoke patriotism. These songs become our way of expressing our personal emotions as well as to connect with our audience.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73656624,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-130205/73656624.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/gujarati/movies/news/d-towners-express-their-desh-bhakti-ki-bhavna-through-movies-music/articleshow/73656624.cms

This junction on Anna Salai, deserted on Republic Day, is usually a picture of chaos due a barricade put at th... Read More

CHENNAI: When Anna Salai was made a two-way stretch after completion of Metrorail work, road users heaved a sigh of relief as they thought the stretch would be free of traffic snarls.

But they were mistaken. Traffic congestion continues at at least two locations on the arterial road due to recent changes made by the traffic police. The introduction of no-right turn at the junction of Cenotaph road and Anna Salai leads to massive traffic snarls. Another rule change of allowing a right turn to Peters Road from Anna Salai also leads to congestion, commuters said.

The first change on the Cenotaph Road-Anna Salai junction means that vehicles coming from Cenotaph Road to join near Appollo Hospital have to travel all the way to Nandanam singnal and take a U-turn.

A senior police official said on an average, nearly 20,000 vehicles congregate at Nandanam junction during peak hours. With the new change on Cenotaph Road, the number of vehicles entering Anna Salai has gone up considerably. ""This new system has led to a delay in movement of vehicles near Nandanam signal,"" said a senior police official.

He said a solution to this problem is the opening up of a stretch near the Raintree hotel. That break was useful for vehicles from Cenotaph Road wishing to take a U-turn.

Another official said before the Metrorail work was completed, vehicular movement from Chamiers Road to Venkatanarayana Road was not allowed. If the U-turn is allowed near Raintree hotel on Anna Salai, it will result in more accidents, he said.

The opening up of Peters Road for vehicles turning right from Anna Salai is also affecting the flow of vehicles from Spencer's signal, a junction known for traffic snarls.

Motorists and road users said the General Patters Road should be made two-way. Introducing such a change will reduce traffic congestion on Anna Salai, they said.

On the two changes in traffic rules, an expert said that a possible solution lies in reverting to the old system of traffic flow on Cenotaph Road.

Similarly, the entry of vehicles from Anna Salai into Peters Road should be avoided to reduce congestion on the stretch, said several residents and commuters.

363,['27/01/2020'],Air India Stake Sale: Government plans to sell entire stake in Air India: Things to know,"(File photo)

Here's an explainer on the sale of

Air India

also known as 'Maharaja':

What's the deadline to submit initial expressions

A government document released showed March 17 as the deadline for submission of initial expressions of interest, and that any bidder must agree to assume Rs 23,287 crore in debt plus other liabilities. It also mentioned that the substantial ownership and effective control of the airline must remain with an Indian entity. Why Centre wants to sell 100% stake in Air India

The potential sale of an airline kept aloft by a more than Rs 30,000 crore 10-year bailout in 2012 comes as the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi divests of money-losing assets to manage the fiscal deficit. The government in 2018 tried to sell 76% of Air India. What are the changes made in this offer

Learning from the experience of the first unsuccessful bid, the key changes made this time include offering to sell 100% government take in Air India and AI Express, which gives complete operational freedom to the new owner. Secondly, last time the bidders were expected to take over debt of Rs 24,576 crore and current liabilities of Rs 8,816 crore — a combine figure of Rs 33,392 crore. This time the debt expected to be taken over has been reduced by almost a third to Rs 23,286, crore all of which is backed by aircraft part of the transaction. The transaction advisor of the Air India proposed sale is Ernst & Young LLP India. What an Air India owner will get

Air India, known for its Maharaja mascot, has more than 13,000 permanent employees and fixed-term contract staff, including over 1,850 pilots and 4,600 cabin crew. A successful bidder would win control of the airline's 4,400 domestic landing and parking slots and 1,800 international slots at Indian airports, as well as 900 slots at airports overseas. While several of Air India's subsidiaries will be excluded from the sale, the buyer will get 100% of low-cost arm Air India Express and 50% of AISATS, which provides cargo and ground handling services at major Indian airports, the bid document showed. The iconic Nariman Point headquarters in Mumbai and the corporate headquarters in Delhi near Connaught Place are not part of this transaction and will remain with the government. Successful bidder will be allowed to use them during the transition period for a couple of years. How is much is the debt on Air India

Air India’s debt as on March 31, 2019, was Rs 58,282.9 crore, with contingent liabilities of another Rs 3,178 crore. Why it may interest Tatas more this time

The Tata Group founded Air India 87 years back. In November last year, Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran had said the he will ask his team to evaluate the Air India bidding. There is a sense that Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Sons and head of Tata Trusts, might be favourably disposed towards the acquisition of Air India, which his predecessor JRD Tata founded in 1932. Apart from Indian carriers, Air India sale may excite some global players too. What the draft share purchase agreement further mentioned

Potential bidders for Air India will have access to draft share purchase agreement and all records of the airline in the initial stage of the disinvestment process itself, according to a bid document. Besides, a due diligence report about the airline would be provided to potential bidders before the request for proposal (RFP) stage. Generally, access to all data records and draft share purchase agreement (SPA) are provided to bidders put in their interest after the preliminary information memorandum (PIM) stage.

NEW DELHI: In a renewed push to sell Air India, the government on Monday said that it plans to sell its entire stake in debt-laden national carrier. The last unsuccessful attempt to sell a majority of Air India stake was done two years back.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73656858,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-91759,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-plans-to-sell-entire-stake-in-air-india-things-to-know/articleshow/73656845.cms

Sharjeel Imam

PATNA: A joint police team of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar conducted raids at the ancestral house of JNU student Sharjeel Imam at Kako in Jehanabad district late on Saturday following arrest order issued against him by Aligarh police in a sedition case.

Imam, one of the organisers of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protest at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh, had allegedly made ""seditious"" statements in Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) by calling for cutting off Assam from the rest of India.

Jehanabad SP Maneesh told TOI on Sunday that raids were carried out in search of Imam at Kako Bazar under Kako police station limit of the district. However, Imam couldn't be arrested.

Imam is wanted in connection with a case lodged with Aligarh police station in Uttar Pradesh, another in Assam as well as Delhi for allegedly giving a provocative speech at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on January 16, a video of which later went viral on social media. He can be heard giving a clarion call for cutting off Assam from India in the video.

The SP admitted that some family members of Imam were quizzed by the members of the visiting police teams. Sleuths of intelligence agencies also interrogated Imam's close relatives. A few of them have been detained as well.

""We are cooperating with the police teams from outside the state in their investigation. There is no case pending against Imam here,"" the SP told TOI over phone before leaving for another destination to trace the JNU student.

Authoritative sources said that the police team left for Patna where some relatives of Imam were living. ""Imam’s immediate family members stay in Patna. We can't share more information related to the ongoing investigation as it's a sensitive issue. Senior officials are monitoring the police operation,"" a police officer posted at the police headquarters said.

Sharjeel has stated on his official Facebook profile that he is from Patna and done schooling from St. Xavier’s High School here as well as DPS-Vasant Kunj in Delhi. Later, he got admitted to IIT-Bombay, from where he did post-graduation in computer science. He also worked as an IT programmer at the University of Copenhagen before coming to JNU, where he is a student in Centre for Historical Studies.

Meanwhile, another video of Sharjeel has surfaced, in which he is heard asking people sitting on dharna in a village reportedly in Gaya district to come out of villages and block national highways in a bid to cut- off vehicular movements between states.

""…The remedy for our problems is forcing the government to agree to our demands…The first thing we did was to unite people to put forth our demands. This step was important because Muslim people stopped coming out on the streets. Last time, we were seen in 1985 but we have not come out on streets thereafter, especially not in such large numbers. The second step will be to use the anger of Muslims by forcefully stopping vehicular movement by sitting on the streets and not getting up till this law (CAA) is not taken back,"" he is heard saying in the video, the authenticity of which has not been verified by TOI.

He goes on to say that Muslim protestors should not get up from the streets ""till the detention camps in Assam are closed"". ""Tell me what you will do if detention camps will be opened in Bihar and women from your houses will be put in those camps. You will have to burn those detention camps.""

Talking about Shaheen Bagh, Sharjeel said: ""Highway has been blocked due to the dharna at Shaheen Bagh- 1.5km has been blocked by protestors and another 1.5km by police. Thus, we blocked the highway for 3km, closed down petrol pumps, toll plazas and shopping malls. Moreover, every resident of Noida now reaches their homes three to four hours late. This is our success that we have kept vehicular traffic jammed in Delhi from one- and-a-half-month. But except Shaheen Bagh, highways have not been blocked anywhere else in India. You all should remember that dharna is different from blocking highways. We will get real success only when 100 Shaheen Baghs will be created.""

The smartphone models come with the name of Galaxy S20 and GalaxyS20+.

The new model names fall in line with that of the previous flagships and the letter F in the end usually denotes the international units which are the unlocked versions. The two devices are filed by Samsung Thailand but the certification said that they are being manufactured in South Korea.

As per earlier leaks and rumours, the Samsung Galaxy S20+ is said to pack 16GB of RAM. The smartphone is also expected to come with Samsung's own 108MP camera. The smartphone is also said to feature a 48MP secondary camera with a 10X zoom and 12MP ultra-wide angle lens.

WELL DONE TEAM INDIA https://t.co/mNiVejPYLR — Raninder Singh (@RaninderSingh) 1578784411000

A trail of camel carts loaded with fresh jaggery greets travellers on NH9, signalling that Meerut is near. Rolling farms of tall sugarcane crops come in the frame. The sweet smell of molasses burning in mills announces one’s arrival in the country’s sugar bowl, a region that is driving the sport of shooting .Along the way, almost all know where teen shooter Saurabh Chaudhary ’s home in the small village of Kalina is — even 80 km away from the destination. The junior world record holder, Youth Olympics gold medallist, Asian Games champion and multiple senior World Cup victor in pistol shooting is now a poster boy in large swathes of Uttar Pradesh. Saurabh, 18, is already being seen as India’s ‘best shot’ at the 2020 Olympics.India’s shooters have bested traditional heavyweights China and the US. The genesis of the surge, many say, lies in the 2016 policy of allowing the lower age-group shooters to be eligible for the senior category. Shooting, they say, has grown younger since. Saurabh’s mother, Brijesh Devi, a homemaker, isn’t acquainted with English but words such as “national camp”, “manual target” and “mental toughness” flow effortlessly in her conversation. With her younger son representing India at the world level, these are “household phrases”.But it’s been quite a journey. Though the Chaudharys now have a personal range in their backyard, there was a time when Saurabh used to place the target in his bedroom, taking aim standing in his parents’ room across. “We had to get a range made at home. The village academy is always crowded. It gets difficult for him to train in peace,” his mother said. “A passage runs between the rooms, so we would stop walking when he practised. A new range is what he needed.”Firearms and UP have a close relationship. Union home ministry statistics for 2018 showed the state has the most number of active licences — 12.77 lakh. Not surprising that it sends almost 1,000 entries for the rifle/pistol nationals each year, 25% of the total entries. Meerut and Baghpat in west UP contribute a major chunk. Hundreds of shooters, mostly in their early teens, can be seen practising at the 25-odd shooting ranges within 80-km radius of the two districts.“Saurabh used to practise at the academy — Veer Shahmal Rifle Club — in Binauli, but the range is always overcrowded,” said Amit Sheoran, Saurabh’s coach. “I started the academy with three shooters in 2012, but there are over 40 kids today.” Sheoran and some friends run three more academies.The Veer Shahmal Rifle Club itself is a mere 10x15 feet room. It hosts around 30 shooters at a time. Only eight get to train at the targets, while the rest do the ‘holding’ practice — clutching a brick equivalent to a pistol’s weight to get used to the weapon. Space is the biggest challenge but numbers increase every month.The love for guns in these parts is not new. Meerut lawyer Pesh Nawaz Khan, 80, said it has seeds both in sugarcane farming and love for game hunting. A personal gun has never been seen as a unique possession here. With the region’s history of violence and dacoity, firearms were needed for protection. “For safety or pride, prominent families have always loved swords and guns,” Khan said.“Shooting enthusiasts hunted in the jungles until the 1972 Wildlife Protection Act kicked in,” recalled Khan, adding, “Hunting stopped but the love for firearms lingered.” They started shooting targets instead. The Meerut Rifle District Association range was already there, built as early as in 1958.“Over the years, the sport widened its base and now even the not so well-off have taken it up. Shotgun is expensive, but airguns aren’t, so youngsters focus on 10m air pistol,” Khan explained.Remarkably, most young shooters today come from modest backgrounds. Shapath Bhardwaj, the youngest shooter, at 14, to represent India at a world cup three years ago, is the son of a local journalist couple. “I didn’t have my shotgun when I started, so my father got a dummy rifle made by a local carpenter. For a year, before I got an actual gun, I just did ‘dry practice’,” Shapath said. Dry practice is holding the gun and aiming at the target without firing.Beyond UP, as one goes across to Madhya Pradesh, another shooting powerhouse, the ethos and milieu of the sport is in sharp contrast. Talent spotting in the more urbanised areas has a “system”. Shooters like Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar, Chinki Yadav, Mahima Agrawal, Shreya Agarwal, Manisha Keer and Sunidhi Chauhan are part of this ecosystem.International medallists Mahima and Shreya are products of London Games bronze medallist Gagan Narang’s academy in Jabalpur. But here, too, many belong to poor families. Manisha is the daughter of a fisherman and Chinki Yadav’s father is an electrician.Narang’s Gun For Glory (GFG) academy started in 2011 in Pune; the Jabalpur one began in 2014. “We conducted talent hunts in schools that were initially reluctant,” Prashant Jain, the Jabalpur director, said. “Very few gave consent, but we still found talented kids. They are national shooters now.”The third region, Kolhapur, may still have some way to go to match western UP, but veterans see great hope. In the last two decades, local shooters like Tejaswini Sawant, Rahi Sarnobat, Swapnil Kusale, Shahu Tushar Mane, Anuja Patil and Abhidnya Patil have bagged a spot on the sport’s international map.“Things have changed so much,” said Tejaswini. “In the late ’90s when I started, there was no setup in Kolhapur. I had to explore each step myself. And now we are producing winners.”",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73657467,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-576949,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/more-sports/shooting/meet-indias-shooting-champions-who-will-go-to-olympics-as-no-1-team/articleshow/73657329.cms

PUNE: Three members of a family, including a six-month-old girl, were injured on Monday morning in an explosion triggered by leaking cooking gas in their house in Pune, a fire brigade official said.

The incident occurred in Sambhaji Nagar in Kharadi locality of the city when Asha Bhawale (26) switched on the gas burner in the morning, he said.

Incidentally, the Bhawale faimly had purchased the new gas connection on Sunday.

Asha, her labourer husband Shankar Bhawale (28), and the couple's daughter Swarali suffered burn injuries in the explosion, which shattered the tin roof of the one-room house.

""Prima facie, the explosion was caused due to leaking gas which was accumulated in the room,"" the official said.

The trio are undergoing treatment at hospital, he added.

Nicknamed as ‘Black Mamba’, he had four daughters with his wife Vanessa — Gianna, Natalia, Bianca and Capri.Bryant and Gianna were on their way to a youth basketball game at the Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks when the chopper they were in came down and burst into flames.

Although Kharaj has been typecast as a comedian in Bengali cinema over the years whenever he has been given the chance to pull off a serious character he has delivered a supreme act, the latest being 'Gotro'.We asked Srijit whether he thought about the potential risk since Kharaj Mukherjee is perceived more to be a comedian than a villain. Plus, there’s also the fact that Utpal Dutta ’s portrayal of Maganlal in Satyajit Ray ’s ‘Joy Baba Felunath’ still remains a favourite among movie buffs.“I think the line between a good comic role and a good villainous role has been blurred since time immemorial and if you have watched Kharaj in Accident, Gotro, Durgeshgorer Guptodhon, you will know that he excels in the negative space. A brilliant actor worth his salt, like Kharaj, will excel in any role.Look at the iconic villain in Joker or Jim Carey in The Cable Guy. Fine actors can easily transfer the histrionics from one zone to the other. Bollywood too has actors like Paresh Rawal and Anupam Kher who can play both with equal aplomb.As for matching up to Utpal Dutta as Maganlal, well he is a class act, a maestro. But then that’s the fun of reinterpretation and doing something afresh. You can build on the legacy and learn from it and give the new generation the taste of our very own Feluda,” explained Srijit.In Srijit Mukherji’s ‘Feluda Pherot’ Tota Roy Chowdhury will play the iconic sleuth and Kalpan Mitra will be seen as Topesh while Anirban Chakraborty plays another iconic character of Lalmohan Ganguly.‘Feluda Pherot’ is based on two popular stories by Satyajit Ray - ‘Chhinomostar Obhishaap’ and ‘Joto Kando Kathmandute’.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73657723,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-105085/73657723.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/bengali/movies/news/why-kharaj-mukherjee-was-chosen-as-maganlal-meghraj-explains-srijit/articleshow/73657741.cms

Chennai: A gang kidnapped and detained a 38-year-old employee of a private advertising firm for his ""abusive remarks"" in an anonymous letter to his rival corporate house.

The gang intercepted Ramasubramanian , a resident of West Mambalam , when he was out for a walk on 10th Avenue in Ashok Nagar on January 24. They bundled him in a car and took him to a lodge in Vadapalani , where they threatened him and locked him up in a room.

They berated him for his derogatory remarks about the particular firm in his anonymous letter sent to the agency a few days ago. The gang members, including a woman, beat him up and warned him of dire consequences, before loking him up in a room in the same lodge. They also confiscated his mobile phone and left him in the custody of one of their aides.

Ramasubramanian, however, managed to give them a slip and rushed to the Government Royapettah Hospital, where he got admitted for injuries caused by the gang.

Later, he filed a police complaint against the gang members. Further investigations are on.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday issued a notice to the Central government on a petition claiming that around 2,000 transgenders were excluded from the National Register of Citizens (NRC) list in Assam . A Bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde issued a notice seeking a reply from the Centre.

The petition, filed by Assam's first transgender judge Swati Bidhan, said that NRC was not inclusive of the transgenders and forced them to accept male or female as their gender. The plea said that most transgenders were abandoned and they do not have documents from before 1971, which is required for the NRC.

The applications did not contain 'others' as a gender category, the plea added. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2019, which seeks to provide a mechanism for social, economic and educational empowerment of transgenders, was passed by the Parliament of India on November 26 and received the President's assent on December 5.

The bill defines the expression ""transgender person"", prohibits discrimination against them, confers the right to self-perceived gender identity and provide that no establishment shall discriminate against them in matters of employment, recruitment, promotion and other related issues.

NEW DELHI: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board ( AIMPLB ) on Monday moved the Supreme Court seeking impleadment in petitions challenging constitutional validity of polygamy and ' nikah halala ' practised among Muslims.

The AIMPLB said the apex court has already dealt with the issue of practices of polygamy and nikah halala in its verdict of 1997 in which it had declined to entertain the petitions.

""That personal laws do not derive their validity on the ground that they have been passed or made by a legislature or by other competent authority. The fundamental source of personal laws are their respective scriptural texts,"" the plea of AIMPLB said.

""The Mohammedan law is founded essentially on the holy Quran and the Hadith of the Prophet Mohammed and thus it can't fall within purview of expression 'laws in force' as mentioned in Article 13 of the Constitution and hence its validity cannot be tested,"" the plea said.

While polygamy allows a Muslim man to have four wives, 'nikah halala ' stipulates that a Muslim woman, who wants to remarry her husband after divorce, has to first marry another man and get divorce from him after consummating the marriage.

The apex court had in 2018 decided to examine the constitutional validity of polygamy and 'nikah halala' among Muslims.

410,['27/01/2020'],Government relaxes bidding norms for Air India stake sale compared to 2018,"This story is from January 27, 2020

(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: In efforts to make Air India disinvestment more attractive, the government has relaxed the bidding norms wherein networth for potential bidders has been fixed at Rs 3,500 crore and minimum stake for an individual consortium partner has been lowered to 10 per cent.

In 2018 when the government sought to offload 76 per cent stake in Air India, the networth amount and minimum consortium partner limit were set at Rs 5,000 crore and 26 per cent, respectively.

The government on Monday came out with the preliminary information memorandum (PIM) for 100 per cent disinvestment of debt-laden Air India as well as sale of Air India Express and 50 per cent shareholding in equal joint venture AISATS.

A person in the know of the PIM details said, an entity can put in bid for Air India on the ""strength of its parent"", which was not there before.

A consortium can participate in the disinvestment process, provided each partner has at least 10 per cent stake as well as 10 per cent of the Rs 3,500 crore networth requirement, according to the bid document.

The lead member of a consortium should have at least 26 per cent stake.

Individuals are allowed to bid as part of consortium.

Also, a domestic carrier without networth can have up to 51 per cent stake while the partner should be able to comply with the Rs 3,500 crore networth criteria.

In 2018, the government had proposed to offload 76 per cent equity share capital of the national carrier as well as transfer the management control to private players.

While, the government would retain 24 per cent stake in the national carrier, the winning bidder would be required to stay invested in the airline for at least three years.

As per the 2018 preliminary information memorandum document, the transaction involved Air India, its low cost arm Air India Express and Air India SATS Airport Services Pvt Ltd. The latter is an equal joint venture between the national carrier and Singapore-based SATS Ltd.

Representative image

It seems like Samsung wants to give the Galaxy S20 series buyers an incentive to make the next Galaxy S-series flagship smartphone their next purchase.

As per a tweet by known tipster Evan Blass , Samsung’s official promotional poster reveals that the company is going to offer its next truly wireless earphones — Galaxy Buds+ — free to those buyers to pre-book the Galaxy S20+ or Galaxy S20 Ultra. These smartphones are said to be the high-end ones among the three handsets that the company is expected to launch on the Galaxy Unpacked event scheduled to be held on February 11.

The leaked promotional poster doesn’t reveal the regions where this offer will be valid so we will have to wait for the launch event to see whether it is applicable in India or not. The poster shows that there is no major change in the design as compared to the existing Galaxy Buds, , which was recently tipped in a Sammobile report.

Just as it has been in the case of the Galaxy S20 smartphone series, a lot of information about the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ has also been claimed online. The company is expected to launch the wireless earbuds along with the Galaxy S20 series.

Known tipster Ice Universe recently suggested that the the Galaxy Buds+ will not “have noise reduction.” The Sammobile also claimed the same last week. The “reliable sources” cited in the report say that Samsung has improved the overall audio quality and enhanced battery capacity. The current generation Galaxy Buds house 58mAh battery, but its successor is claimed to house 85mAh battery capacity. This is said to deliver 12 hours of juice in a single charge. Next, the report says that Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus will house four microphones, which is double of what the current generation earphones offer. This is said to be done to fix the call quality grievance that users have raised.

413,['27/01/2020'],"CAA: PM Modi's nationalism masks a bad economy, protesters say","This story is from January 27, 2020

NEW DELHI: Through some of the coldest nights in a century, the students of New Delhi gathered outside the city's police headquarters. They chanted anti-government slogans, recited Pakistani resistance poets, and flashed witty posters to make a stand against a new citizenship law that excludes Muslims.

As the confrontations continue across the country, though, they've morphed into a wider protest against economic prospects and financial disparities. Violence flared at campuses as the authorities cracked down on the demonstrations that have become Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's biggest test since he won power more than five years ago.

""Their handling of the economy is disastrous,"" said Akshay Bajaj, 29, a post-doctoral student who helped organize protests at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur. ""There are no jobs, falling growth and rocketing prices for vegetables.""

Like so many of the protests across the world that have defined the last 12 months, the contentious legislation in India was effectively just a tipping point for the under 30s. With tear gas clouds sweeping across Beirut again this week and regular clashes in Hong Kong, the students in New Delhi and Mumbai have added to the sense of global malaise.

The protests were triggered by a new law called the Citizenship Amendment Act that fast-tracks religious minorities from three neighboring countries, except for Muslims. They intensified after police stormed the Jamia Millia Islamia university in December to crush what it said were acts of vandalism.

In solidarity, students spilled out of colleges across the capital and even elite management and technology schools to protest against Modi and his confidante Amit Shah, India's powerful minister for internal security.

""Nationalism, far from being reversed, made further headway,"" billionaire philanthropist George Soros told the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, according to excerpts from his speech. The biggest and ""most frightening setback,"" he said, was in India.

Protesters say the law undermines India's Constitution, which treats all religions equally. They fear it will be misused, together with a proposed National Citizens' Register, to disenfranchise poor Muslims who lack the documents to prove their residency. The government instead should have expended its energy on reversing the worst economic slump in a decade and the highest unemployment rate in 45 years.

""The government doesn't attempt to answer the grievances of the people, it is instead distracting us with these kind of issues,"" said Mihir Jain, 26, a chartered accountant who last month participated in his first ever public protest. ""If today we allow them to go ahead with this, we don't know what will come next.""

Peaceful protests continued last week, with at least two dozen rallies and sit-ins in Mumbai and New Delhi and several others scattered across the country. The Supreme Court on Wednesday deferred a hearing on cases challenging the constitutional validity of the citizenship law. A human chain is planned for January 30, the anniversary of the slaying of Mahatma Gandhi by a Hindu fundamentalist, according to messages being shared on college WhatsApp groups.

Economic anxiety served as the kindling for the protests while the new legislation was the spark, said Milan Vaishnav, director for the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Then as food prices spiked, the demonstrations turned into a focal point for many strands of disenchantment with the government, he said.

Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party says the new law will offer refuge to persecuted minorities from India's neighboring countries and it won't impact any Indian citizen. It sees the rebellion as a reflection of how the law is misunderstood.

Party member Baijayant Panda told Bloomberg Television on Thursday that the government has started an outreach program to explain it more clearly. ""You've had TV bites where they aren't able to say why exactly they are protesting,"" said Panda. ""Some think they are protesting against inflation.""

While India's economy ballooned to about $3 trillion since the nation adopted its constitution in 1950, much of the population remains left behind. Modi swept to power in 2014 promising India's poor and middle classes he'd restore their "" dignity"" after years of inequality.

Yet Swiss bank Credit Suisse Group AG estimated the richest 10% of Indians held 74% of the country's wealth in 2019, up from 62% in 2012. S Subramanian, a member of the advisory board of the World Bank's Commission on Global Poverty, said underlying data from a government report leaked in November indicate that an even larger share of Indians have slipped into poverty. The government says it has concerns about the quality of this database.

About 30% of Indian youth aged 15-29 are not in employment, education or training, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, more than double the average. India's economy is forecast to grow 5% in the year ending March 2020, the slowest pace since 2009, and inflation accelerated last month to the fastest since 2014.

Modi's administration will present its annual budget on February 1 and analysts say it's unlikely to have adequate tools to combat the economic slowdown as the deficit swells. Meanwhile the pushback is being led by the very people who were considered a potential new support base for Modi and are now disenchanted with the lurch toward Hindu nationalism.

His campaign in 2019 was fueled by a combination of Hindu nationalism, economic populism and air strikes against arch-rival Pakistan. The new citizenship laws were among Modi's promises; he won the vote with a massive majority.

Shrishti Parihar, 19, said the legislation acts as a convenient smokescreen for the government. Until recently, she was discussing job security with her friends, but now Modi and Shah talk of nothing but religion, she said.

""The economy is in such bad shape—that should be our main concern,"" said Parihar. ""Instead, we are talking Hindu-Muslim.""

VADODARA: Around 20 labours working on the project to build a solar dome on the Akota-Dandia Bazaar link fell on Monday morning when the scaffolding on which they were standing collapsed.

The scaffolding was erected to install decorative panels on the interior of the solar dome. The work on the project was going on for quite some time and one lane of the link was closed to facilitate the project. The workers used a large bamboo scaffolding erected almost throughout the length of the solar dome on the Akota-Dandia Bazaar lane of the link.

The work on the structure of the solar dome was completed recently and aluminium panels were being erected on its interior for or aesthetics. Those who were present on the site told media that only one labour who was working on the project when the incident took place had serious injuries. It seemed that the labours were safe as most of them fell on a pile of bamboos that gathered due to the collapse. Fire brigade officials rushed to the spot for rescue operations.

415,['27/01/2020'],Why Nomination is important in Mutual Fund investing,"800x600px_Fund-for-every-goal_002

Disclaimer: Content Produced by Invesco Mutual Fund

Life can be very unpredictable. In the unfortunate demise of the unit holder in a mutual fund scheme, the nomination (if registered) helps in transferring the units to the nominee. Let’s understand more about the nomination in mutual funds.1. Define nomination in the context of mutual fund investing?The process of appointing a person to take care of the assets in the event of the investor’s demise is called Nomination. The nominee can be any family member of the investor – spouse, child, a friend or any other trustworthy person. New folios/accounts opened by individuals with single holdings are now mandated to have nomination facility. Where there are joint holdings, with more than one holder, nomination is not mandatory. However, even in this case, financial planners always recommend that new folios should have a nominee..2. Is it possible to not appoint a nominee?The ultimate choice of having a nominee depends on the investor. In case, the investor decides against having one, all they need to do is sign on the requisite space in the form, indicating the same.3. What is the process of making a nomination?Nomination can be done by filling in the details of the nominee in the assigned column of the form. However, non-individuals like society, trust, corporate bodies, karta of Hindu undivided family (HUF), and holder of power of attorney are not allowed to nominate. Nomination is permitted for joint holders; however, the surviving holder becomes the beneficiary in the event of event of death of the other holders. The nominee becomes the beneficiary only in the case of death of all the holders.4. What is the maximum number of nominees that can be appointed?Up to 3 nominees can be appointed in one mutual fund folio. The percentage of amount that will go to each nominee in case of the unit holder’s demise can also be specified. Each nominee is eligible for an equal share if the percentage is not specified.5. Is there any benefit of appointing a nominee for MF investments?One of the biggest benefits of appointing a nomination is that it helps in smooth transfer of funds to the nominee(s) on the demise of the investor. Not having a nominee will increase the process of claim for the heirs/claimant as they may have to produce documents like a will, legal heir certificate, no-objection certificate etc. to get the units transferred in their name.6. Can a nominee be changed once registered?An investor can, as per his wish modify a nominee at any time.Mutual Fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73659187,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-753805,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/why-nomination-is-important-in-mutual-fund-investing/articleshow/73659187.cms

At its worse, it can even lead to pneumonia, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), failure of kidney and even turn fatal. A recent statement by a Chinese official has raised growing concerns. “People who are asymptomatic - not showing symptoms - can also infect others.” This makes it all the more difficult to control it.We spoke to Dr K K Aggarwal, President, Heart Care Foundation of India (HCFI) & Confederation of Medical Associations of Asia & Oceania (CMAAO) about the virus. “All countries are susceptible to new strains because their populations do not have immunity against them. It will enter India and India is not adequately equipped to identify individuals who carry the disease at entry ports. Besides, the diagnosis of coronavirus remains a challenge as the initial symptoms resemble those of common cold or respiratory diseases. We need to diagnose the first case and not allow it to spread to others. For this multiple ministry coordination is required.”“As this strain is a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), no individual is immune to its infection. Thus, its entry and spread into India must be prevented. The Indian government has reached out to the WHO to understand whether India needs to take any precautionary measures to prevent the entry of this novel virus that causes deadly respiratory disease. The WHO recommends the prevention of viral spread through regular washing of hands, covering the mouth and nose while sneezing and thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. All authorities, including the National Health Authority, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and the National Health Portal must join hands and act in unison to spread public awareness about this novel virus and symptoms of infection for the early identification of its occurrence and prevention of spread. Stringent quarantine measures and accurate diagnostic techniques must be employed for appropriate diagnosis, contact tracing, isolation and treatment of patients and to prevent mortality.”Experts are not too sure how travel restrictions will really help.

INDORE: A judicial magistrate on Saturday inspected the cell in central jail where Amit Soni , accused in multiple cases including human trafficking, was lodged.

Chief judicial magistrate first class Aman Singh Bhuria inspected the prison on Soni’s application that he was mentally harassed by being put in a special cell.

Soni’s counsel Ashwin Kumar Adhiyaru said, “We had moved an application requesting court’s direction in the matter of mental harassment caused to the accused in prison.”

In the application, Adhiyaru said that Soni had been put in a 6 sq feet cell and was allowed outside for an hour in a day. This is against the guidelines of the Supreme Court and National Human Rights Commission causing mental harassment to Soni, said Adhiyaru. The court accepted the application and the prison was inspected by the judge. The matter will be heard on Monday, said Adhiyaru.

An anticipatory bail application, filed in a case registered at MIG police station against Soni under Section 188 for disobeying public servant, was withdrawn, he said.

Adhiyaru said, “We have withdrawn the bail application as the document couldn’t be presented before the court in the case during the hearing on Saturday.”

Amit Soni was arrested after a raid of a joint team of over 200 officers from police and six other departments conducted at the residence, hotel, bar, cafe and office of businessman Jitu Soni on November 30, 2019.

Hindus in Pakistan protest against forced conversion (AP file photo)

SINDH: In yet another case of forced conversion in Pakistan, a Hindu girl was abducted during her wedding ceremony and was married off to a Muslim man after being converted to Islam.

The woman- Bharti Bai- was abducted by a group of people during her marriage ceremony on Saturday in Hala, a city located in Matiari district in Sindh province. She was then married to Shah Rukh Gul.

The authorities have not taken any action against the abductors. According to reports, the police helped the men in forcibly taking away the bride.

Every year, around 1,000 young Sindhi Hindu girls between the age of 12 and 28 are abducted, forcibly married and converted to Islam, US-based Sindhi Foundation has said.

In Pakistan, many such incidents are regularly reported where girls belonging to the country's minority community, mainly Hindu, Sikh and Christian, are forcibly converted to Islam and married off to Muslim men.

Over the past few months, several incidents have come to fore highlighting the miserable condition of minorities in the country.

In August last year, 19-year-old Jagjit Kaur remained missing for several days. Later, it was learnt that she was forcibly married to a Muslim man by her abductors.

Daughter of Bhagwan Singh, a 'granthi' (priest) of Gurdwara Tambu Sahib, she was converted to Islam at gunpoint.

The incident sparked a furore in India, with several political leaders across parties seeking action against the perpetrators of such crimes.

GUWAHATI: The Centre and Assam government will sign a comprehensive peace agreement with all the faction of National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) and All Bodo Students Union (ABSU) in presence of home minister Amit Shah and chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal at North Block today afternoon, which will end the over three decades of Bodo militancy in the state.

The four factions of NDFB are led by Ranjan Daimary, Govinda Basumatary, Dhiren Boro and B Saoraigra and the All Bodo Students’ Union. Along with ABSU president Pramod Boro, the leaders of the four factions are now in North Block ahead of the signing of the peace deal.

Amid protest in Assam and New Delhi by non-Bodo groups who fear that the new peace accord will include more non-Bodo inhabited areas in the autonomous council under 6th Schedule of Constitution, Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the new peace accord would not upgrade the existing Bodoland Territorial Autonomous set up under the 6th Schedule of the Constitution either to a separate state or a Union territory.

Sarma said, “Neither Union territory will be created nor new areas will be added to the BTAD. Assam’s territorial integrity will be kept intact if a fresh Accord is signed in the near future.”

The present Bodoland territorial council area comprises four districts—Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baska and Udalguri and were created under the 2003 accord signed between centre, state and now disbanded militant group Bodo Liberation Tigers.

436,['27/01/2020'],Reliance's partnership with Saudi Aramco not a retreat from energy business: Report,"This story is from January 27, 2020

(File photo)

NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries ' partnership with Saudi Aramco for its $75 billion oil-to-chemicals business signals expansion rather than retreat as growth opportunities are expected to boost the petrochemical and refining vertical, market analyst firm Bernstein said.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani had in August last year announced initial agreements to sell a 20 per cent stake in the oil-to-chemical business to the Saudi national oil company. Also, a 49 per cent interest in fuel retailing business was sold to UK's BP plc for Rs 7,000 crore.

""Reliance has pivoted away from energy to the new economy. But energy still accounts for 64 per cent of EBITDA. While RIL has divested stakes to BP and Aramco, we expect RIL to grow their petrochemical and refining business given the secular growth opportunities,"" it said in a report.

Stating that India has significant secular expansion (that is, unaffected by short-term trends) ahead in refined products and petrochemicals, it said with the lowest demand per capita of 1.3 barrels per person, demand for refined products will grow by 5 million barrels per day over the next two decades, more than any other major market.

Ethylene demand could grow ten-fold from 5kg per person per annum to 50-60kg pp/pa as consumer demand rises.

""Reliance partnership with Aramco and BP signals expansion ahead rather than retreat,"" Bernstein said. ""Aramco's investment is to secure market access and growth. While refining is a cash cow for the business, we believe that there are significant opportunities for petrochemical expansion ahead given demand growth and synergies with refining.""

Fuels marketing will be significantly expanded given the partnership with BP and plans for 5,500 stations, it said.

Ambani had in August last year announced that the deal with Aramco will close by March 2020 but it is now expected to close within the current calendar year.

Refining and petrochemicals are a cash cow for Reliance.

""But to think of this as an ex-growth part of the business would be a mistake. In India, there is strong secular demand growth ahead. India is estimated to be the fastest growing refined fuels market over the next 20 years (faster than China) and will also one of the fastest growing markets for petrochemicals given the per capita demand which will grow with the GDP,"" it said.

As part of the August deal, Saudi Aramco will supply 500,000 barrels per day of crude on a long-term basis to RIL's Jamnagar refinery complex (40 per cent of the refining capacity).

""While bears will argue that Reliance is stepping away from energy to digital, we see this deal as an opportunity to expand the downstream business in India with a solid partnership. For Aramco, the deal provides direct access to what is widely expected to be the fastest growing refined oil product market over the next 20 years,"" it said. ""For Reliance, it provides cash to fund expansion of their digital business and further expansion of downstream capacity with an experienced partner.""

Bernstein also said in the short term it remains cautious on chemical margins, but more positive on refining.

On RIL's oil and gas exploration and production business, it said output will start to recover from this year with new developments.

""Reliance and partners are developing 3 trillion cubic feet of reserves in the KG-D6 block which can add gross production of 1 billion cubic feet per day and raise segment EBITDA back to Rs 120 billion,"" it said.

The turnaround is based on three new projects which Reliance and partner BP has launched in the KG basin. Notably the R-Series, Satellites and MU development which together contain 3 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of reserves which will underpin a recovery in production.

But the refining segment remains one of the most important contributors to earnings for Reliance.

The single largest asset within Reliance's refining and petrochemical business is the Jamnagar complex, which is one of the world's largest refining hubs.

The Jamnagar complex was built in 2000 with a capacity of 0.67 million barrels per day. After upgrades in 2008, Jamnagar's crude processing capacity has more than doubled to 1.24 million bpd. Not only is Jamnagar the largest refinery hub in the world, it is also one of the most complex refineries globally, allowing RIL to process discounted heavier crude oil into oil products.

""In comparison to global oil majors, Reliance has relatively less refining capacity at 1.24 million bpd versus peers at 2.62 million bpd. However, Reliance has one of the best positions to grow its capacity over time given India's structural growth in oil demand over the next 20 years,"" it said. ""Moreover, Reliance has one of the most profitable refining business relative to peers owing to the higher complexity of Jamnagar. Whether Reliance will choose to expand its existing footprint is not clear, but the relationship with Aramco (assuming the deal goes through) means that there could be options for further expansion.""

In fuels marketing, Reliance has also formed a new JV with BP last year to create a world-class fuel retailing network in India. Over the next 20 years, India is likely to be the fastest growing fuels market. The new JV company will assume ownership of RIL's existing fuel retail network and aviation fuel business.

Under the new partnership, RIL will hold 51 per cent of the new JV company and BP will hold the remaining 49 per cent. The JV has plans to rapidly grow the fuel retail distribution network in India over the next 5 years. RIL currently has 1,400 sites across India including contribution of $1.9 billion per annum in revenue from owned petro retail outlets.

The JV plans to expand this to 5,500 sites over the next 5 years, which represents 800 additional sites per year.

""For BP, the JV gives them access to the fastest growing refined fuels market. It also allows BP to tap into convenience non-fuel retail in India which is growing rapidly. For Reliance, the transaction provides funding and enables them to tap into BP's extensive fuels marketing experience,"" it added.

443,['27/01/2020'],"India vs New Zealand: Tough to hit Jasprit Bumrah, need to learn how to adapt from India, says Tim Seifert","This story is from January 27, 2020

Tim Seifert and Jasprit Bumrah.

HAMILTON: In awe of Jasprit Bumrah , New Zealand wicketkeeper Tim Seifert says the Indian speedster's subtle variations have been difficult to pick in the ongoing T20 series and his side needs to a learn a thing or two about adapting from the visitors.

India beat New Zealand by seven wickets in the second T20 International in Auckland on Sunday to grab a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.

Bumrah returned with figures of 1-21 from his four overs as Indian skipper Virat Kohli changed his bowling plans from the first game.

""Even in the first game, Bumrah bowled slower balls that were going wider. Normally, death bowlers get into straighter lines, plus yorkers and mix it with chest height. He kind of changes things a lot and is tougher to play,"" Seifert said.

""...the ball was holding a lot more which made it tougher. So sometimes as a batsman you have to move away from the stumps and see if they bowl straight. I was backing myself to do something different instead of just standing there at the wicket,"" said the stumper, who remained unbeaten on 33 off 26 balls.

""It was tricky and the ball was holding a little bit. When Kane (Williamson) got out in the over against Yuzvendra Chahal, we knew it was the over to push because they had Bumrah coming back,"" he added.

He said New Zealand batsmen need to take a cue from their Indian counterparts on how to adapt to different conditions quickly.

""...Indian batsmen showed how to get under the ball and time it. They showed it a couple of times that and on the slower wickets you just have to keep it like that. Once you lose your shape, you are not in position,"" he said.

""Try to get them (bowlers) off line or off balance, try to get into that position to hit good balls. That's T20 cricket as well. Sometimes it's going 100 per cent but some times you have to take a breath and re-assess. Indian batters did that well.""

Seifert believes New Zealand bowlers did reasonably well in the two games but they have been outplayed by the Indian batsmen.

""To be honest, in the first game they were 110-1 and they had wickets in hand. We didn't bowl too badly in that first game. In the second game, we only got 130 and it is tough to bowl at Eden Park (with that total),"" he said.

""170 was the target in mind but once you get 130 on the board, that was going to be very hard at Eden Park against a team that is very strong and playing really well. But our spinners were outstanding. Good balls have gone to boundary.

He said coming into the T20 series on the back of a lost Test rubber in Australia also didn't help New Zealand's cause in the first two games.

""Boys are coming off a Test series (in Australia) and a lot of them haven't played T20 cricket for a while,"" he said.

""But for some like me, I have had the Super Smash for the last two months, so I have played a lot of T20 cricket. They have two games under their belt now so hopefully they will have a better understanding.""

Asked if New Zealand would want to play on India's strength of chasing, Seifert replied, ""Even in ODI cricket, India have chased down big totals but I think on that wicket it was going to get slower and slower.

""But with that small target on Eden Park, something special has to happen with top six (for a collapse). One batsman got fifty and the other was batting very well. We needed top five-six in the first 10 overs,"" he said.

The Black Caps are still confident of bouncing back in the series.

The third T20 will be played here on Wednesday before back-to-back matches in Wellington and Mt Maunganui. Seifert said they would like to replicate the 2019 tour of India, where New Zealand came out 2-1 victorious in the three-match series.

""We have lost the first two games but we haven't played badly. We definitely haven't played our best though while India has played very well. If we lose the series on Wednesday, it is not the end of the world. But if we can turn things around, and win, we will take things from there,"" he said.

""We won the series 2-1 last time, so we have to treat it like a three match series again. But we have to treat it like the first two are must-win games.""

Seifert said New Zealand have plenty of time and matches to prepare for the ICC T20 World Cup to be held in Australia later this year.

""We are not playing our best at the moment. There are 20-odd games before the World Cup, and that tournament is the pinnacle, so we will get there (in preparation),” he signed off.

NEW DELHI: The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) on Sunday welcomed the steps taken by the US to stop supply of counterfeit and pirated goods on e-commerce platforms and wants similar measures by the Indian government also.

Under the new policy, published by the department of homeland security of the US government, the liability for counterfeits has been shifted from third parties to e-commerce platforms.

Notably, the new policy framework will put Amazon and other e-commerce companies in the US for policing the counterfeit goods, said the CAIT in a statement.

Commenting on the development, CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said that it evidently shows that e-commerce platforms are not only engaged in malpractices but also promote counterfeit and pirated goods and even in their home country US.

CAIT will also ask the government of India to bring such policies for Indian e-commerce market.

""Taking this issue, a delegation of the CAIT will soon meet Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal...,"" he said.

According to Global Brand Counterfeiting Report, global sales of counterfeits are growing at 15 per cent per year and is estimate to touch $1.82 trillion in 2020 and the share of e-commerce is stated to be 25 per cent share of this figure.

Fresh petitions were filed before the Supreme Court against the amended citizenship law and population register by All India United Democratic Front , Ason Jana Morcha, and others.

One of the petitions said that the collection of such data may lead to possible unsanctioned state surveillance of private citizens who have not engaged in unlawful activity. No provision or responsibilities have been fixed in case of unauthorised access to the data by third parties, the petition said.

""The nature of the exercise is manifestly arbitrary with no grounds 'doubtfulness' being specified apart from no guarantee of protection and security of the data/information so collected. Such a database would erode basic freedoms that the persons within India currently enjoy,"" it said.

The plea said that the entire exercise of creating and updating the population register is a ""gross invasion of privacy of private citizens"".

Last week, the Supreme Court had granted the Central government, four weeks' time to file a reply on over 140 petitions regarding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and refused to put a stay on the newly enacted law.
