0,2020/03/09,"Coronavirus | ATP, WTA tennis tournament in Indian Wells cancelled","First major US sports event to be hit by coronavirus outbreak

The ATP and WTA tennis tournament in Indian Wells has been cancelled over fears surrounding the new coronavirus outbreak, making it the first major sports event in the US to be scrubbed due to health concerns.

Health emergency

The tournament, one of the biggest outside the four tennis Grand Slams, was cancelled just days before it was due to begin. Officials said in a news release on Sunday they opted to cancel because California health officials had declared a public health emergency for the Coachella Valley after a confirmed case of COVID-19.

“We are very disappointed that the tournament will not take place, but the health and safety of the local community, fans, players, volunteers, sponsors, employees, vendors, and everyone involved with the event is of paramount importance,” said tournament director Tommy Haas.

Days earlier, organisers had said they planned to go ahead with extra health measures in place such as hand-sanitising stations, improved cleaning protocols and gloves for ball kids, volunteers and food workers. The ATP and WTA had also issued virus-related guidelines, telling players not to accept items from fans to be autographed.

Before the cancellation, the tournament had offered to give refunds to anyone who had bought tickets, but did not want to attend. The tournament draws more than 400,000 fans each year.

Many of the players had already arrived in Indian Wells with qualifying matches scheduled to start on Monday and the main women's draw beginning on Wednesday. “I'm shook,” Canadian tennis star Denis Shapovalov wrote on his Twitter page.

The number of coronavirus cases in the US has exceeded 500 spread across more than 30 States.

“There is too great a risk, at this time, to the public health of the Riverside County area in holding a large gathering of this size,” said doctor David Agus, professor of medicine and biomedical engineering at the University of Southern California.

The fifth Slam

Indian Wells lasts two weeks and draws some of the largest crowds for a tennis event in North America. The number of competitors and lucrative prize money being offered for the men and women has helped earn it the nickname of ‘The Fifth Slam’.

There is also a men and women's tournament scheduled for Miami later this month but there was no word on any changes to that event.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/65214s/article31025686.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10WELLS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/coronavirus-atp-wta-tennis-tournament-in-indian-wells-cancelled/article31025687.ece
1,2020/03/09,Zeel’s zeal impresses Clark,"Feels that she is becoming more professional in all aspects of her training and match play

It’s not easy to win against a player who has the home advantage. Zeel Desai realised this after battling it out for nearly four hours — three hours and 55 minutes, to be exact — before being beaten by top seed Sandra Samir of Egypt in the ITF women’s final in Cairo on Sunday.

The title may have eluded her, but the 21-year-old Zeel, accompanied by coach Todd Clark, got a firm grip on her game and temperament during the campaign.

By getting past quality opponents with authority, prior to the summit clash, Zeel showed that she had improved by leaps and bounds. To prove her all-round ability, she made the doubles final as well.

For someone who was quite impressive at the junior level, reaching a career-best rank of No. 18 in 2017, Zeel looked to have made a smooth transition to the senior grade when she won the women’s title in the ITF circuit the same year, in Gwalior. It takes time to gain experience, and Zeel has spent the last two years acquiring it.

Coach Todd Clark, who has groomed Zeel in the last few years at the Ahmedabad Racquet Academy, is confident that Zeel, ranked No. 686 in the World, would break into the top-500 over the next three weeks when she competes in Tunisia.

Tough competitor

“It is great to see an athlete evolve, both physically and mentally. Zeel competed from the first point until the last, and physically was in good shape at the end of the match,” said Clark, pleased with his ward’s performance as well as the composure with which she handled the contest.

“Zeel is becoming more professional in all aspects of her training and match play. It is exciting to watch,” said the coach. “She is learning from each and every match, regardless of the outcome. Today’s match [the final] was no exception. I am confident that the result [loss] will further strengthen Zeel’s mental resolve,” said Clark.

For a tough Australian like Clark, there is no room for excuses and only drive and desire matter if a player has to move forward. Zeel is on the right track and moving ahead at a brisk pace, a positive sign for Indian women’s tennis.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/r21179/article31025524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Zeel-Desai-Coach-Todd-Clark-2,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/zeels-zeal-impresses-clark/article31025525.ece
2,2020/03/09,"How the entertainment industry, education models and taboos around crypto could change, post-SC ruling","For many years, India was not a crypto-friendly nation... but a five million-plus strong pro-crypto community is now celebrating its new freedom. We speak to four crypto-preneurs about what to expect:

Akshay Aggarwal had been waiting with bated breath to hear the verdict of the Supreme Court regarding crypto-currency, an encrypted, decentralised and digital medium of exchange. As the founder of Blockchained India, a pan-India community for crypto enthusiasts, this ruling means the most to him in terms of freedom of investment and of movement.

Finally, a verdict was made last Wednesday: ‘SC rules curb on crypto-currency trade illegal’, and thus the ban on trading in virtual currency, crypto-currency and Bitcoins was lifted. Judging from the excitement on social media and relevant online forums, it was as though a cataclysmic election win took place. Plus, with the ongoing Yes Bank crisis, some crypto-lovers such as Rohan Jethi simply tweeted, “Short banks. Long Bitcoin.”

India’s pro-crypto community is five million-plus strong, and interestingly, despite our population and online presence, India only accounted for around three percent of the global crypto-currency market before the ban. Surely, these figures could grow slowly as more currencies are created and more progressive discussions are held.

An excited Akshay admits he was quite nervous in the lead-up to the verdict. “I had a slight positivity though there was still disappointment in the regulators that penalised innovators because of their own narrow thought process.”

Shinam Arora, who heads Pune-based Primechain Technologies, which facilitates self-building blockchain ecosystems, says, “I don’t understand why RBI couldn’t come up with a way earlier to monetise it. If they would have monetised it, it would have helped in our country’s growth and economy so much by now. For example, they could have simply imposed a minimal charge towards cryptocurrency exchange.”

A vast ecosystem, affected

The umbrella of this technology is so vast that it is just impossible to enumerate the different sub-markets... almost like the fight club of banking, as in it exists but not many talk about it.

Shinam points out that India is a potential investment epicentre for the world too; many global crypto-currency companies will be looking forward for expanding their business in India.

Crypto has its own exchange market like mainstream currency would, too. Akshay predicts the acceleration of crypto-neo-banks (a type of direct bank) which would speed things along, “I see sophistication and maturity coming in this industry,” comments Akshay, “mainly because of increased demand, which will lead to increased competition. I am expecting a hundred more exchanges to open up in the next two years.”

The entertainment scene could change too. myNK, India’s first blockchain-powered global entertainment platform, foresees positivity. Founder Nitin Narkhede says, “The entertainment industry will be one of the early adopters of crypto. Crypto adoption can streamline many processes in film and music industries, create new financing options and improve payment models in the industry, thereby benefiting many smaller artistes and stakeholders. New payment mechanisms will find their way in the existing systems and new companies will emerge to cater to these requirements.” He elaborates that myNK will benefit in a big way because the platform “deals with international distributors and can now open options to accept and make payments in real-time using crypto besides other channels that we can now open to build a crypto-enabled entertainment ecosystem.”

The gaming industry also sees a lot of interaction with crypto. Up until about two years ago, gaming platform Steam operated many transactions through such means but put a stop to it because of its ineffectiveness, and this could change given the massive Indian population on Steam.

What of education; do experts see a potential for schools and colleges to at least inform students about crypto-currency? Wilson Bright, who heads Bengaluru-based BlockSurvey, explains, “I think it would be wonderful to inform young people about the entirety of the banking ecosystem and state that there are alternatives! There is also the myth that to invest in Bitcoin, for example, you have to own one whole Bitcoin, so BlockSurvey hopes to inform and educate people about the value of owning your own transactional freedom and being proud of it. So this is the time to really get the conversation going because people will now be curious, so the first step is to get rid of misinformation.”

Shinam agrees with Wilson adding, “I know of lot of people who have invested money in cryptocurrency without understanding it. They don’t know how this system works and that’s why they fall prey to fraudsters; so awareness and understanding is very important if you want to trade in virtual currencies.”

Be realistic

However optimistic things look, such startups must be patient when it comes to acquiring funding after a barren time. While the situation is clearer de justo, the same might not be de facto; there are many mindsets to converse with. Akshay says, “Now in this extreme economic vulnerability, I don’t think much is going to change with this one early positive indicator. This will definitely restore faith and bring confidence to Indian crypto-entrepreneurs; maybe early adoption results could even convince some investors to take bets on them.”

Though the battle is won, the war is far from over. “Post SC ruling, if the review petition doesn’t yield a negative result again, we shall push forward our goals of enabling mass adoption towards mobilising support from politicians,” avers Akshay, “I see a lack of futuristic thinking towards use of technology generally, and I believe we need to identify or elect pro-tech champions to push positive regulations. We need to continually direct these debates to the right problem, that being of prohibiting only the negative use.”",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/c9hwpb/article31029953.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy10-crypto-rgb,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/why-more-people-will-be-curious-about-crypto-economics-in-india-post-sc-ruling/article31023663.ece
3,2020/03/09,‘The Division 2: Warlords of New York’ review: a fun experience with new enhancements,"The latest expansion of the Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft video-game takes us back to familiar territory

The more I played The Division 2, the more it made me miss the first game. In many ways, New York was the definitive setting for the game. The Division 2 could have continued in New York instead of the less-exciting Washington DC. With the new Warlords of New York expansion to The Division 2, the setting thankfully switches back to New York, complete with the Christmas decorations.

Persistent threats

The world of The Division, which features a pandemic that spread along the backs of dollar bills, feels very in line with the news today. The game brings a new biological virus threat into the equation, and the return of Aaron Keener, the antagonist of the previous game. A rogue Division Agent, who along with his four horsemen, is set to bring about a reckoning in Lower Manhattan.

Tom Clancy’s The Division 2: Warlords of New York Developer: Massive Entertainment

Massive Entertainment Publisher: Ubisoft

Ubisoft Price: ₹700 onwards for the standalone expansion.

₹700 onwards for the standalone expansion. Availability: All platforms.

Warlords looks every bit as impressive as its predecessor. Streets are claustrophobic with realistic debris piled high, brimming with abandoned cars, giant broken Christmas ornaments, all telling a story of a better time. The agents themselves look detailed, reflecting the guns, skills and armour that you select, while the enemies are varied with distinctive markings for each type. The best part? The guns in the game are well-implemented, from hip-fire to aim-use, and you will actually feel like John Wick.

New York is a little different this time around. Lower Manhattan is still reeling from a hurricane, resulting in some impressive scenes of urban decay and disarray. For those who are fairly new, the game bumps you up to Level 30 for the expansion. The gameplay largely remains the same, with Warlords being more of a single-player jaunt. To draw out Keener, you have to take down his warlords — you do that by freeing their territories. Standard Division slash Ubisoft grind tactics. Though, it’s a lot more fun than Division 2.

‘Overwhelming but accessible’

Apart from the action, Division is about the maths. When you shoot people, you see numbers pop out. These numbers are governed by more numbers. One look at the inventory screen is a gaggle of figures and statistics that make up your damage and defence attributes. These, thankfully, have been streamlined to show you the numbers that matter, with gear roll ranges along with handy icons. It does look overwhelming but, overall, accessible.

Along with this expansion, also come a lot of enhancements. The most important is the post-endgame SHD level system, which enables you to keep playing through various Division 2 seasons. You can amp up your ‘skill tier’ upto 6 by strategically acquiring weapons and other equipment. If you are at tier 6, then the effectiveness of your selected skill increases by upto 60%.

The Dark Zones have been streamlined, which is the best part of The Division games. Agents go into a highly infected zone filled with powerful enemies, other agents, and a whole lot of loot that you have to extract via a helicopter dispatch. Anything goes here. You never know when an agent, who you thought was your ally, will go rogue to steal your hard-earned loot. You can choose to go rogue if you want, but you would be marked for a manhunt.

Ubisoft has understood the risks in Dark Zones and have upped the quality of loot with each excursion.

While there is still more of the same going on in the new edition of the game, being back in New York was a fun experience, even if it was for a short time. The enhancements are welcome, especially the skill tiers, making Washington DC a bit less boring.

4,2020/03/09,A Mumbai-based photographer is one of the winners of Apple’s Night Mode photo challenge,"Mitsun Soni describes the photographic encounter which took place in Dubai

Mumbai photographer Mitsun Soni is thrilled that his otherworldly photo of a mammoth-sized tree in a quiet square in Dubai is one of the winning shots for Apple’s Night Mode photo challenge for iPhone 11 users.

The photo was taken at around 2 am during a recent trip to Dubai. “I was walking around with some friends in the city who promised me some zaffran chai, which I do not even drink. I then saw this very random tree in the middle of the night in Dubai and was blown away. It was strange because there were no people about and there was this red glow from this nearby hotel sign. I snuck into a quiet corner with no people or cars and I gave the Night Mode a shot and the light just fell perfectly.”

Mitsun, who took the photo with an iPhone 11 Pro, adds that he does not think this would have been possible with any other phone’s Night Mode or Night Sight, but states, “I’ve only ever been an iPhone user, though.”

Did Mitsun adjust much in post-capture? “Not much except for some small details, the light speaks for itself. There is no noticeable difference between the original and the final versions.” The photo on Mitsun’s Instagram, which has more than 2,700 likes, says it has been edited with Snapseed, Vsco and Adobe Lightroom.

Photographer Tyler Mitchell praised the picture saying, “This one blows my mind. I have no idea where that deep rich red light is coming from on the tree. It almost feels like a UFO sitting above the tree, just out of frame. Absolutely beautiful composition as well.” Group Creative Director at Apple, Arem Duplessis, pointed out, “The rich red colour of the tree and ground gives this picture an otherworldly quality. Paired with the night sky, it feels like a still from a sci-fi film.”

The deep blue of the night sky along with the red is likely to remind Stranger Things fans of The Upside Down for sure. Very soon, India will see Mitsun’s shot on a larger-than-life billboard on your nearest high street.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/rnq7qo/article31023107.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10mp-nightmode-mitsun,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/mitsun-soni-mumbai-photographer-one-of-the-winners-of-apples-night-mode-photo-challenge/article31023108.ece
5,2020/03/09,How does the Apple Watch Series 5 fare in an intense outdoor workout?,"The writer heads to Lonavala to test the Workout app along with some of the other under-discussed features in the device

The air in the hills of Lonavala is profoundly cleaner than that in Hitec City, Hyderabad, making it an ideal testing ground for a full-on fitness regimen. I had been wearing the Watch for about seven months since the launch and while my morning workouts and meditations are frequent, I felt I had not truly gauged what made this Watch such a big deal.

Yes, it is pretty; the case is made from recycled aluminium and has a low-temperature polysilicon and oxide display (LTPO), making it bump-proof. The device also uses green LED lights paired with light‑sensitive photodiodes to detect the amount of blood flowing through your wrist at any given moment. Basically, when your heart rate picks up, the blood flow in your wrist, and the green light absorption, are proportional.

But I would not find myself truly exploring the more intricate features past the goal-oriented Activity rings which measure active energy and resting energy, and the occasional swim or Pilates session... I had also come to learn that the Watch records the anaerobic data that comes with interval training, too.

But Siri on the Watch is not as responsive as it is on other devices in the ecosystem, so do not expect to switch workouts with Siri just yet.

United workout

Here in Lonavala, a morning hike with coach Urmi Kothari kicks off at 6.15 am. The workout app on the Watch brings up a number of workout types from ‘indoor walk’ to ‘flexibility’ and ‘rower’. It lets you link a sequence of workout types under one large fitness session; so when entering a workout mode, you would not end a hike or a swim or a yoga session, you would bind them together for an overall reading of how your body responds to a continuous session.

Various screens for the Workout app in Apple Watch

Urmi has us selecting the ‘flexibility’ session and starting a timer along with a calorie counter as we loosen up tight hamstrings, tense shoulders, stiff necks and out-of-whack spines.

Given I have a lower-than-average blood pressure and high metabolism, my heart rate rose to 110 beats per minute while everyone else was pegged at around 80 beats per minute. Urmi assured me the reading was normal. “The idea is not to compare these readings with other people,” she states. “If something is of concern, Apple Watch will save that data which you can show to your trainer and doctor. It is not a substitute for a healthcare professional. Also given you have entered your weight, age and height — and have been wearing the Watch for a while — your respiratory patterns are learned by the device to give you more accurate readings and look out for irregularities.”

Can the Watch reduce risk of a stroke? There are no concrete answers to this yet, but this year, Apple and Johnson & Johnson’s cardiovascular clinical trial, called Heartline, will help shed light on how personal tech will factor into the medical field. Understandably, participants for the trial are aged 65-years-plus.

The inclines in Lonavala are not too steep but enough for the Watch to detect the angles at which I am walking. If I were doing this with just my iPhone, the Health app would probably have ‘thought’ I was using the stairs. But because I had activated a ‘hike’ mode, the Watch intuitively placed itself in that environment.

Before you buy The Apple Watch Series 5 and the Health app on the iPhone exchange live data, such as active energy and resting energy.

While swimming, the Watch Series 5’s in-water lock feature does not let any accidental taps occur. Turning the Digital Crown (the dial on the side) helps the Watch rid itself of any water which may have seeped in.

The Watch Series 5 comes with GPS only (starting at ₹40,900) and with GPS and Cellular (₹49,900). The latter lets you leave your phone at home if you are headed out for a run or a swim but want to still take calls.

Post-hike, we switched to a leisurely ‘outdoor walk’ to the yoga pavilion. A quick peek at the Always On display reveals a 287-calorie burn for a 10-minute warm-up, a 45-minute hike, followed by a 10-minute walk. I even closed the Activity rings twice. Plus, the Environmental Sound Levels reading showed 40 decibels, unlike the 60 to 80 decibels I am surrounded by in Hyderabad. Not exactly health-related is Night Sky by iCandi Apps, an app which uses Augmented Reality and an Apple device’s in-built compass to pinpoint surrounding constellations, satellites or even space stations. This is a particularly nice app for our pollutant-clouded cities.

As Anshuka Parwani put us through a yogic washing machine, we switched to ‘yoga’ mode without terminating the previous workouts. A couple of peeks at my Watch during the more dynamic aerial yoga moves showed a heart rate of 132 beats per minute, and at the end, I had burned 340 calories.

Apple aggrandises femtech through the Watch too; Anshuka also points towards the Watch’s Cycle Tracking feature for women, “Stressors can warp a cycle and your Watch can alert an irregularity.” The specialists at the event also recommend Lifesum for those who are avid diet trackers.

At the moment, the Apple Watch is the top selling watch — not just smartwatch — you just have to make sure that you use the technology... not vice versa. Share data with which you are comfortable becoming a dataset. On the other hand, the Apple Research app (not built into devices) even offers a dedicated place for people who want to join multiple health studies at once. Apple assures that the Health app data is totally private, but I would recommend reading the Watch’s privacy policy if you want some peace of mind.

6,2020/03/09,Coronavirus | EU seeks to tackle virus as infections spread,"Italian PM asks for easing borrowing limits to contain the outbreak; six inmates die in a prison riot over new restrictions

EU leaders will seek a coordinated response to the coronavirus after Italy sealed off much of its industrial north, where six prisoners were killed in a riot over curbs on visits.

EU leaders will hold a teleconference to discuss their next moves, European Council President Charles Michel said, with one official saying the call was likely to take place on Tuesday. “We need to cooperate in order to protect the health of our citizens,” Mr. Michel, who chairs EU summits, tweeted.

In little more than two weeks, the number of recorded coronavirus cases in Italy has surged to 7,375, with 366 deaths, the second-highest death toll after China's, putting its health system under huge strain.

More than 1,10,000 people have been infected in 105 countries and territories, and 3,800 have died, the vast majority in mainland China, according to a Reuters tally.

Explained | How is India containing COVID-19?

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said strict European Union borrowing limits should be loosened and the flexibility envisaged by EU budget rules should be used “in full”.

“Europe cannot think of confronting an extraordinary situation with ordinary measures,” he said.

Italy's prison administration said six inmates had died in a prison riot in the northern town of Modena over new restrictions on visits.

Series of rebellions

“There have been a series of rebellions across the country,” said Francesco Basentini, head of the authority. Video aired on TV showed police and fire trucks outside the prison as black smoke swirled into the sky.

With Italy's economy already on the brink of recession, bars and restaurants in Lombardy were ordered to close or to restrict entry and maintain a distance of at least a metre between people on their premises.

At the weekend, people had queued outside supermarkets to buy food and there was widespread confusion about what exceptions might apply to rules saying people could travel only for proven work reasons or emergencies.

The rules do not stop people going to and from work or prevent goods deliveries, and Switzerland left its border open for the thousands of Italians who commute from Lombardy into the neighbouring Swiss canton of Ticino every day.

7,2020/03/09,U.S. Presidential Election 2020 | Cory Booker endorses Biden ahead of key primaries,"Earlier, former V-P got Kamala Harris’s backing

Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden, who is seeking to deliver a knockout blow to rival Bernie Sanders on Tuesday as six States vote, received another boost on Monday when former presidential hopeful Cory Booker endorsed his campaign.

The U.S. Senator from New Jersey, who ended his own White House bid in January, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Biden would “restore honor to the Oval Office.”

Also read | U.S. Presidential Election 2020: What are the Democratic presidential primaries all about?

Mr. Booker’s endorsement — one day after another onetime candidate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, did likewise — means Mr. Biden has picked up the backing of two black former presidential contenders as he seeks the party’s nomination to take on Republican President Donald Trump this fall.

Wave of endorsements

Mr. Biden over the past nine days has powered to the front of the contest for the Democratic nomination to take on Republican President Donald Trump on November 3. A wave of endorsements by his former rivals has made him the clear standard-bearer for the Democratic Party’s moderate wing, while Mr. Sanders represents the party’s more liberal elements. A win in the Midwestern “rust belt” State could give the former Vice-President an insurmountable lead in the number of delegates needed to win the nomination at the party’s July convention.

Mr. Sanders, a U.S. Senator from Vermont, may need a victory in Michigan to recapture momentum after Mr. Biden showed surprising strength in last week’s Super Tuesday contests. An opinion poll from the Detroit Free Press published on Monday found Mr. Biden holding a 24-percentage-point lead over Mr. Sanders among Democratic voters in Michigan.

Also read | Is it all over for Bernie Sanders?

One of the most talked-about moments of Ms. Harris’s campaign was her blistering attack on Mr. Biden during a June presidential debate. She called his remarks about working with segregationist Senators hurtful and questioned Mr. Biden’s 1970s opposition to school busing.

Mr. Sanders scored a surprise upset in Michigan four years ago in the Democratic primary against eventual nominee Hillary Clinton. Ms. Clinton would later lose the historically Democratic State by a narrow margin to Mr. Trump. On Sunday, he sought to close that gap with an endorsement from the Reverend Jesse Jackson, a civil rights leader and 1984 and 1988 Democratic presidential contender.

Six inmates were killed in a prison riot in Italy and guards were taken hostage at another jail, as unrest spread in prisons across the country over measures to contain the coronavirus (COVID-19), including restrictions on visits.

Italy's government has imposed a virtual lockdown across much of its wealthy northern regions at the epicentre of the contagion, in an effort to contain a virus which as of Sunday had killed 366 people.

In a TV interview, the head of Italy's prison administration Francesco Basentini said three inmates had died inside a jail in the northern town of Modena, and three others had died after being transferred away from the prison.

China on Monday condemned U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for branding COVID-19 as the “Wuhan virus”, terming his remarks as “despicable behaviour” and an attempt to stigmatise the Communist nation.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the novel coronavirus as COVID-19, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a media briefing here responding to Mr. Pompeo’s comments.

“Certain U.S. politicians turning a blind eye to science and the decision of the WHO has rushed to stigmatise China and Wuhan under the pretext of COVID-19. We condemn such despicable behaviour,” Mr. Geng said.

Last Friday, Mr. Pompeo repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the “Wuhan virus”, pointing to the Chinese city where the virus first emerged in December last year and also blamed Beijing for not sharing enough information about the disease which put the U.S. “behind the curve”.

According to the WHO, COVID-19 cases have been reported in over 100 countries and regions including the U.S., India, South Korea, Italy and Iran.

The WHO report said a total of 105,586 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide as of Sunday, an increase of 3,656 infections from the previous day, including 3,610 new cases outside China.

Mr. Pompeo seemed to blame the Chinese government for the outbreak of the virus, CNN said in its report on his comments.

“Remember this is the Wuhan coronavirus that’s caused this and the information that we got on the front end of this thing wasn’t perfect and has led us now to a place where much of the challenge we face today has put us behind the curve,” Mr. Pompeo said on CNBC.

“It has proven incredibly frustrating to work with the Chinese Communist Party to get our hands around the data set, which will ultimately be the solution to both getting the vaccine and attacking this risk,” he added.

Though he did acknowledge he was “happy” with the efforts China had taken to contain the spread of the virus, Mr. Pompeo said, “no less authority than the Chinese Communist Party said it came from Wuhan”.

“We have pretty high confidence that we know where this began, and we have high confidence, too, that there was information that could have been made available more quickly and data that could have been provided and shared among health professionals across the world,” he said.

On March 5, another Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the origin of the virus is yet to be determined.

“It is yet undetermined where the virus originated. Wherever its origin may be, China and all the other affected countries are victims faced with the challenge in containing its spread,” Mr. Zhao said.

While there is appreciation around the world for China’s efforts to contain the virus with virtually locking down the worst-hit Wuhan and Hubei province, with a population of over 50 million people, Beijing also faced criticism for acting late as over five million people from Wuhan left for the Chinese New Year holidays by the time the measures were initiated.

Responding to Mr. Pompeo’s comments that China did not share information, Mr. Geng said that Beijing shared the genome sequence of COVID-19 with WHO and other countries in an “open and transparent and responsible manner”.

He said China positively responded to concerns and stepped up international cooperation.

“What China has done won precious time for the global fight against the epidemic. We make positive contributions and all the world bears witness to this.

12,2020/03/09,Ashraf Ghani sworn in for second term as Afghan President amid crisis,"Two blasts were heard as Afghanistan's two rival leaders held parallel presidential inaugurations in Kabul.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was sworn in for a second term on Monday as his rival Abdullah Abdullah held a parallel inauguration that could plunge the country deeper into crisis ahead of peace talks with the Taliban.

“I swear by the name of God that I shall obey and protect the holy religion of Islam, respect and supervise the implementation of the constitution”, Mr. Ghani said at an oath-taking ceremony attended by hundreds of people, including visiting foreign dignitaries, diplomats and senior political figures.

Afghan challenger Abdullah Abdullah inaugurated himself as President, minutes after the incumbent Mr. Ghani was sworn into office for a second term, deepening a political crisis that has stoked fears for upcoming peace talks with a strong Taliban.

Mr. Ghani was declared as the winner of the election held last September, but Mr. Abdullah, who disputed the vote, held a parallel ceremony surrounded by hundreds of supporters during which he vowed to ""safeguard the independence, national sovereignty, territorial integrity"" of Afghanistan.

Two blasts during presidential inaugurations

Two blasts were heard as Afghanistan's two rival leaders held parallel presidential inaugurations in Kabul, underscoring the country's woeful security ahead of talks with a resurgent Taliban.

Hundreds of people had assembled at two venues inside the presidential palace complex to watch the swearing-in ceremonies for Mr. Ghani and challenger Mr. Abdullah, when the blasts were heard, prompting some to flee.

13,2020/03/09,Sudan’s Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok survives assassination attempt,"The attack highlighted the fragility of Sudan’s transition to civilian rule.

Sudan’s Prime Minister survived an assassination attempt on Monday after an explosion went off near his convoy in the capital of Khartoum, Sudan’s state media said.

Abdalla Hamdok’s office and his family confirmed he was safe following the explosion. Sudanese state TV said Mr. Hamdok, a longtime economist, was heading to the Cabinet’s offices when the attack took place, and that he was taken to a “safe place.”

The attack highlighted the fragility of Sudan’s transition to civilian rule, almost a year after pro-democracy protesters forced the military to remove autocratic President Omar al-Bashir from power and replace him with a joint military-civilian government.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, and it was unclear what type of device caused the explosion.

Footage posted online showed two white, Japanese-made SUVs vehicles used by Sudan’s top officials parked on a street, damaged with widows broken. Another vehicle was badly damaged in the blast. Several dozen people were seen in the site of the attack, chanting- “With our blood and soul, we redeem you, Mr. Hamdok.”

The protest movement that led the uprising against Mr. al-Bashir called the blast a “terrorist attack.” The statement by the Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change called on people to take to the streets to “show our unity and cohesion ... and protect the transitional authority.”

After months of negotiations, the military and the pro-democracy movement reached a power-sharing deal in August, at which point Mr. Hamdok took office. The deal established a joint military-civilian, 11-member sovereign council to govern Sudan for the next three years.

Prominent activist Khalid Omar, secretary general of the Sudanese Congress Party, said the attempt on Mr. Hamdok’s life was a “new chapter in the conspiracy against the Sudanese revolution.”

Monday’s blast came less than two months after an armed revolt from within Sudan’s security forces shut down the capital’s airport and left at least two people dead. The tense stand-off between the armed forces and rogue intelligence officers paralysed street life in several parts of Khartoum, along with another western city.

In 1989, Mr. al-Bashir came to power in an Islamist-backed military coup and imposed a strict interpretation of religion on its citizens, limiting personal freedoms. The country was an international pariah for its support of extreme Islamists.

Sudan’s transitional authorities announced in February that they agreed to hand over al-Bashir to the International Criminal Court along with other former officials wanted by the ICC.

Sudan’s transitional government has also been under pressure to end wars with rebel groups as it seeks to rehabilitate the country’s battered economy, attract much-needed foreign aid and deliver the democracy it promises.

Nearly a year after Mr. al-Bashir’s ouster, the country faces a dire economic crisis. Inflation stands at a staggering 60% and the unemployment rate was 22.1% in 2019, according to the International Monetary Fund. The government has said that 30% of Sudan’s young people, who make up more than half of the over 42 million population, are without jobs.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/km8ecz/article31022978.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUDANPM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sudans-prime-minister-abdalla-hamdok-survives-assassination-attempt/article31022979.ece

The number of COVID-19 cases in Germany has passed 1,000, official data from the Robert Koch Institute disease control centre showed on March 9.

There are now a total of 1,112 confirmed cases in Europe's biggest economy, with the region of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) reporting 484 infections — the highest number among Germany's 16 states.

In a bid to slow contagion, Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for gatherings of more than 1,000 people to be scrapped across Germany, which could affect many events including Bundesliga football matches.

NRW state premier Armin Laschet said he planned to follow Spahn's advice in scrapping large gatherings in the state, meaning that several football games, including Saturday's derby between Dortmund and Schalke could be played in empty stadiums. Wednesday's game between Borussia Moenchengladbach and Cologne would also be affected, said NRW health minister Karl-Josef Laumann.

15,2020/03/09,Twitter labels video retweeted by Trump as ‘manipulated’,"The social media platform has struggled with removing deceptive and abusive content in the past, but has also faced accusations its curbs have suppressed some political views.

Twitter has used a new policy to identify misleading content for the first time on a post retweeted by U.S. President Donald Trump that appeared to show Democratic Party rival Joe Biden endorsing his re-election.

The social media platform has struggled with removing deceptive and abusive content in the past, but has also faced accusations its curbs have suppressed some political views.

Last week it announced moderators would begin flagging media that had been “deceptively altered or manipulated”, the same day it announced an expansion of a ban on hate speech.

A clip posted by White House social media director Dan Scavino appeared to show Mr. Biden telling a crowd: “We can only re-elect Donald Trump.”

The footage was later retweeted by Mr. Trump and had been viewed nearly six million times by Monday.

But the video cropped the end of Mr. Biden's sentence — made during a recent campaign speech in Missouri — where he was discussing the need for party unity in the wake of a bruising primary contest.

“We can only re-elect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here,” Mr. Biden had said.

Twitter appended a label to the video describing it as “manipulated media”, prompting a denial from Mr. Scavino in a later tweet on Monday.

The platform last month suspended dozens of accounts for spam-like posts supporting former Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg, whose campaign hired hundreds of people to promote him on social media.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/p9otbk/article31022489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Twitter,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/twitter-labels-video-retweeted-by-trump-as-manipulated/article31022490.ece

20,2020/03/09,"Malaysia to unveil cabinet on Monday, after new PM named amid turmoil","Muhyiddin Yassin will present the list of ministers to the king before making an announcement in the afternoon, his office said.

Malaysia's new prime minister will announce his cabinet on Monday, a week after he was appointed amid political turmoil, with a technocrat or technocrat-turned-politician expected to be drafted into the crucial finance ministry as the economy slows.

Muhyiddin Yassin, who succeeded Mahathir Mohamad after the seasoned politician abruptly quit last month, will also have to accommodate members of a corruption-marred party and an Islamist group in the cabinet after forming the government with their support.

Muhyiddin Yassin will present the list of ministers to the king before making an announcement in the afternoon, his office said.

Mr. Muhyiddin could tap someone with finance experience as the finance minister or keep the role himself and name a technocrat as his deputy in the department, said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of an official announcement.

One of the top contenders for a ministerial position in the finance department is Mustapa Mohamed, an economist turned politician from Muhyiddin's party, the source and another person with knowledge of the matter said.

The prime minister's office declined to comment. Mr. Mustapa did not respond to requests for comment.

While the current government that replaced a multi-ethnic one could steer policies towards Malay nationalism, its immediate priority would be to try and shield Southeast Asia's third biggest economy from the impact of the coronavirus spread.

Malaysia has so far reported 99 cases of coronavirus infection.

The government has cut its growth forecast for this year and announced a 20 billion ringgit ($4.76 billion) stimulus package. The economy grew at its slowest pace in a decade in the fourth quarter.

The sharp fall in world oil prices, which intensified on Monday, will also be a drag on the country, the world's third-biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas.

21,2020/03/09,Embassies close in North Korea as diplomats evacuated over virus,"North Korea has not confirmed a single infection but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and putting thousands of its own people into isolation.

Several embassies in North Korea closed on Monday as many diplomats were flown out following weeks of tight quarantine restrictions imposed by Pyongyang over the spread of the novel coronavirus.

North Korea has not confirmed a single infection but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and putting thousands of its own people into isolation.

It has also subjected hundreds of foreigners -- including diplomats -- to a virtual lockdown in their own premises.

Russian ambassador Alexander Matsegora described the conditions as ""morally crushing"".

Those restrictions were finally eased last week after more than a month, when more than 200 foreigners were allowed to leave their compounds.

Swedish ambassador Joachim Bergstrom tweeted a selfie from the city centre with the caption: ""I have never been happier standing on Kim Il Sung Square.""

Monday's evacuation comes after reports that a special flight was being arranged to fly diplomats and other foreigners from Pyongyang to the Russian city of Vladivostok.

""Sad to say farewell this morning to colleagues from German Embassy and French Office #NorthKorea which are closing temporarily,"" tweeted Colin Crooks, the British ambassador to Pyongyang, adding that his embassy would remain open.

The Vladivostok airport website showed an Air Koryo flight JS 271 had arrived from Pyongyang at 10:49 am local time (0049 GMT).

It was not immediately clear how many diplomats were on board, but previous reports said around 60 people would be evacuated.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned last month of ""serious consequences"" if the virus reaches his country, which has banned tourists and suspended international trains and flights.

Pyongyang, subject to multiple international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, has a weak medical infrastructure and analysts say prevention is its only option.

22,2020/03/09,North Korea fires 3 projectiles: South’s military,"The three devices were fired in a northeasterly direction from the Sondok area in South Hamgyong province, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, without further details.

North Korea fired three unidentified projectiles into the sea on Monday, Seoul's military said, the second such weapons test by Pyongyang in a week.

The three devices were fired in a northeasterly direction from the Sondok area in South Hamgyong province, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, without further details.

""The military is monitoring for additional launches and maintaining readiness,"" it added.

A spokesman at Japan's defence ministry said North Korea launched what appeared to be ""ballistic missile(s)"", adding there had been no indication of anything coming down in Tokyo's territory or exclusive economic zone.

Analysts say the North has been continuing to refine its weapons capabilities during its long-stalled nuclear discussions with the U.S., which have been at a standstill since the collapse of the Hanoi summit between leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump more than a year ago.

Three projectiles fired successfully from a single Transporter Erector Launcher (TEL) would be ""a new milestone"" for the North's short-range ballistic missile programme, tweeted Ankit Panda, senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists.

Vipin Narang of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology added: ""Kim continues to test, improve, and operationalize his force.""

After last week's launch the North's state media said Kim had overseen a ""long-range artillery"" drill, carrying images of multiple launch rocket systems and several of a larger calibre rocket being fired in a forest.

South Korea said that launch appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles -- which the nuclear-armed North is banned from testing under UN Security Council resolutions.

Personal letter

Monday's launch came days after Mr. Kim sent a personal letter to the South's President Moon Jae-in, offering ""comfort"" for the rapid outbreak of the new coronavirus in the country.

South Korea has one of the world's largest infection totals outside China with more than 7,300, while Pyongyang insists it has not had a single case.

That message had followed an unprecedented statement by Mr. Kim's younger sister Yo Jong, when she berated Seoul for its condemnation of Pyongyang's weapons test last week was a ""truly senseless act"" and ""perfectly foolish"".

The North carried out a series of weapons tests late last year, the last of them in November, which it often described as multiple launch rocket systems although others called them ballistic missiles.

It also conducted static engine tests, most recently in December.

Pyongyang set Washington a unilateral deadline of the end of 2019 to offer it fresh concessions on sanctions relief, and at a party meeting in late December Kim declared the North no longer considered itself bound by its moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests.

He also threatened a demonstration of a ""new strategic weapon"" soon.

Pyongyang is under multiple sets of sanctions over its weapons programmes from the United Nations Security Council, US, South Korea and others.

Heightened tensions in 2017 were followed by two years of nuclear diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington, including three meetings between Kim and US President Donald Trump, but little tangible progress was made.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dayfh9/article31020570.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOUTHKOREANORHTKOREALAUNCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/north-korea-fires-3-projectiles-souths-military/article31020571.ece

The sun shone on deserted squares in Milan and empty gondolas in Venice on Sunday as a quarter of Italy’s population came to grips with being cut off from the rest of the country, under new rules strictly limiting movement in and out of the new red zone.

While some packed their bags and fled, most in northern Italy stayed to brave a lockdown imposed by the government on some 15 million people, as it ramps up the fight against the deadly coronavirus.

The country on Sunday recorded the second-highest coronavirus toll in the world, after reporting a sharp jump in deaths — from 133 to 366 — and overtaking South Korea on infections.

Italy’s interior ministry said anyone flouting the lockdown risked at least three months in jail or a 206 euro ($233) fine.

Only people with a “serious” reason that cannot be postponed, such as urgent work or family issues, will be allowed in or out of the quarantine zones, which cover Lombardy and 14 provinces in four other regions.

Passengers departing on flights in the lockdown areas will need to justify themselves — apart from people who had been in the area temporarily, who are allowed to return home. All arrivals will need to justify their travel.

Covid-19: full coverage

Police will be setting up controls at train stations to check people’s temperatures, and stopping all cars on main roads in and out to verify the reason for travel, the ministry said in a statement.

Cruise ships will be forbidden from docking in Venice, with only passengers who are residents of the Renaissance city allowed to disembark.

Alitalia suspended national and international flights to and from Milan Malpensa airport, and announced it was operating only domestic routes from Milan Linate.

The borders with Austria, Switzerland and Slovenia remain open.

Pina Antinucci, a psychoanalyst in her 60s who lives in Milan, told AFP she was suffering nightmares and felt the state was “bombarding us with anxieties, spreading paranoia“.

“I’d like to know if I’m infected... it would be better to know if I have that unwanted guest who occupies our homes, minds and lives,” she said.

With 366 fatalities, Italy has recorded the most deaths from the COVID-19 disease of any country outside China, where the outbreak began in December.

The new rules came shortly after the news that the number of people infected had jumped by over 1,200 in a 24-hour period.

The plan was leaked to the media on Saturday, infuriating Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who slammed it as “unacceptable”, saying it had created “uncertainty, anxiety, (and) confusion”.

Expert Massimo Galli, the head of a team of doctors from the Biomedical Research Institute in Milan who managed to identify the Italian strain last month, told AFP it had been a “disastrous communication error” and “absolute idiocracy“.

Italian virologist Roberto Burioni described the leak on Twitter as “pure madness“.

“The draft of a very harsh decree is leaked, sparking panic and prompting people to try and flee the (then) theoretical red zone, carrying the virus with them,” he said on social media.

Vincenzo Tosetti, a 34-year old actor and Venice resident, told AFP “many people I know have fled, mainly from Milan”.

“This is going to test the Italians’ ability to behave responsibly, and I have to say that up until now they’ve been failing. There’s been an exodus“.

Fellow Venetian Giancarlo, 49, who did not want to give his last name, said “you can feel the anxiety in the air“.

The floating city was also virtually empty of tourists, which was “a big blow“.

“First the city was hit by record floods, now this. Venice is very fragile right now,” he said.

Italy has found itself at the forefront of the global fight against the virus, with more than 5,800 infections recorded in the past seven weeks.

The virus has now spread to all 22 Italian regions, and the first deaths are being recorded in Italy’s less well medically equipped south.

The head of the Puglia region in southern Italy pleaded with anyone thinking of returning from Lombardy and the other 11 provinces in lockdown — which include the cities of Parma and Rimini — to “stop and turn around“.

“Get off (the train) at the first station, don’t get on the flights to Bari and Brindisi, turn your cars around, get off the bus at the next stop. Don’t bring the epidemic to Puglia,” he said on Facebook.

“You are carrying to the lungs of your brothers and sisters, grandparents, uncles, cousins and parents the virus that has severely strained the health system in northern Italy,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2t5dfe/article31019848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1206116242,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/empty-streets-and-paranoia-as-northern-italy-goes-into-lockdown/article31019849.ece
24,2020/03/09,Clashes as thousands protest violence against women in Chile,"Small clashes broke out near the presidential palace, which was under heavy police protection, when demonstrators tried to clear security barriers

Clashes broke out between police and protesters as hundreds of thousands of women marched in Santiago to demand an end to violence against women.

The protesters on Sunday gathered at the Plaza Italia, one of the main hubs for the more than four months of anti-government demonstrations, and filled the nearby streets.

They then marched up Alameda Avenue, one of the main thoroughfares in the Chilean capital, chanting and singing as they went.

“It’s great to see so many women today,” Elizabeth, one of the demonstrators, told AFP.

She came out to demand protection of indigenous women’s rights.

“I love when women put their ovaries to the side and become empowered, move forward and change everything.”

Small clashes broke out near the presidential palace, which was under heavy police protection, when demonstrators tried to clear security barriers. Police drove them back with tear gas and water cannon.

Protesters also unfurled a banner outside the palace demanding Pinera’s resignation.

Many of the women wore green headscarves, symbolizing the fight for abortion rights, or purple scarves with “NiUnaMenos” (roughly, We can’t lose one more woman) -- an anti-femicide rallying cry -- written on them.

More than 125,000 people marched, according to police estimates. Protest organizers put the number at 500,000.

The protest stretched for at least four kilometers (2.5 miles), according to AFP journalists.

More than 30 people have died in Chile since protests began last October with the announcement of a modest hike in metro transport fares.

The demonstrations, the worst since the fall of Pinochet’s dictatorship in 1990, have mushroomed to encompass wider discontent over social and economic woes.

The aim is to pressure Pinera’s conservative government to expand social reforms it has already proposed in order to quell violent protests which began last October.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/x7pr2x/article31019735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WOMENS-DAYCHILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/clashes-as-thousands-protest-violence-against-women-in-chile/article31019736.ece
25,2020/03/09,Brazil: Women in several cities march against Bolsonaro,"On Paulista Avenue, one of the sprawling city’s major roadways, the demonstrators — many dressed in red or purple — braved a driving rain

Women turned out in force in Sao Paulo and other Brazilian cities, using the platform of International Women’s Day to protest the policies of far-right president Jair Bolsonaro.

Also read | The Amazon fires, an alarm that lacks proportion

The women on Sunday marched under banners proclaiming “He cannot continue,” an allusion to the president’s trademark machismo and frequent mockery of women — he once told a female lawmaker he would not rape her because she was “not worth it“.

“The government’s policies have consisted of taking away the rights of women workers,” 35-year-old Marcela Azevedo, with the group Women in Combat, told AFP. Her group was one of several protesting in Sao Paulo.

On Paulista Avenue, one of the sprawling city’s major roadways, the demonstrators — many dressed in red or purple — braved a driving rain.

The demonstrations were at least partly in response to a new political offensive by Mr. Bolsonaro, who on Saturday called on his backers to take to the streets on March 15 in a show of support.

The president’s critics have called the planned mobilization anti-democratic.

Also read | Where Latin America women are fighting the world’s highest murder rates

Two weeks ago, Mr. Bolsonaro provoked an outcry when he shared on the WhatsApp messaging system a video calling for the March 15 rally. The video was highly critical of both parliament and the judiciary branch.

After several lawmakers and judges protested, Mr. Bolsonaro said he was merely passing the video along to friends.

But on Saturday, he embraced the call for a “spontaneous” rally.

“Bolsonaro has revealed his anti-democratic side by calling for demonstrations against the other branches of government,” Marcela Azevedo said.

“That is also why we are here: democratic values are dear to women.” Nearby, several women unfurled a banner bearing the words “For the life of women, we are fighting for democracy.”

Other anti-Bolsonaro marches are planned in coming weeks, with a big one set for March 18.

The size of the duelling rallies will be viewed as a barometer of the president’s popularity, which has slipped in his second year in office amid a slowing economy.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iozz81/article31019661.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRAZILINTERNATIONALWOMENSDAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/brazil-women-in-several-cities-march-against-bolsonaro/article31019611.ece

Italy on Sunday recorded the second-highest coronavirus toll in the world, after reporting a sharp jump in deaths and overtaking South Korea on infections.

The number of fatalities nearly tripled, rising from 133 to 366 Sunday, according to the civil protection agency, with most deaths occurring in the hard-hit Lombardy region in Italy’s wealthy north.

South Korea currently has some 7,313 cases, and Sunday said its rate of infection was slowing.

Civil protection agency chief Angelo Borrelli said Italy was ordering 22 million surgical masks to help stop the spread.

30,2020/03/09,Netanyahu asks court to delay corruption trial,"His trial is scheduled to start two weeks after an election that saw Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party earn the most votes

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked on Monday for a 45-day delay in his corruption trial due to open March 17, saying prosecutors had not provided all information relevant to the case.

His trial is scheduled to start two weeks after an election that saw Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party earn the most votes but fall three seats short of the 61 needed to form a majority in the Parliament, or Knesset.

The election result raised the prospect that Netanyahu, the first Israeli premier to be indicted in office, will be seeking to form a government while standing trial.

A letter sent by Mr. Netanyahu's lawyers to the Jerusalem district court, seen by AFP, said that the premier's legal team “had not received all the documents related to the investigation”.

Mr. Netanyahu has been indicted on various charges including receiving improper gifts and offering a media mogul lucrative regulatory changes in exchange for positive coverage.

He has denied the allegations.

31,2020/03/09,Chennai Central takes on its younger ‘sibling’ Egmore Station,"One is synonymous with Madras, while the other is an icon in its own right, if ignored. Which stirs more emotions in you, Chennai Central or Egmore station?

A sepia-toned picture of a clocktower along the banks of Buckingham Canal is the first image that crosses your mind, when somebody utters the golden word: Madras. It is the place that receives every traveller with open arms, irrespective of geographical boundaries. Where Mani Ratnam’s characters roam, fostering cutesy romances. This is Chennai Central — yes, we are old-fashioned and still swear by that name.

Madras Central, as it was known, came into existence in 1873. You do realise that we are talking about 147 years of history, right? Where do we begin? Of course, it is an architectural marvel that is both Gothic and Romanesque.

Designed by George Harding, it is spread across 17 platforms with over 19 trains operating on average. A news report in 2012 stated that the station plays house to over 180,000 passengers at any given point of time. It might not be the cleanest railway station in the country (we are working on it), but sure boasts excellent connectivity and hassle-free services. Let us take cinema, for instance. Every filmmaker tends to romanticise Chennai Central, which, sadly, isn’t the case with its ‘underdog’ sibling. Yes, there have been movies that manifested fake hopes about train rides (courtesy: Gautham Menon). My journeys, for one, are filled with tales of desperation to meet a Jessie or Meghna. But the key is to not get carried away by cinema.

There is more to Chennai Central than its rich legacy and colourful history. It is that sheer joy of crossing the Basin Bridge Station, expectedly peeping through the window only to be received by a signboard that reads: Chennai Central. It is an experience every Madras-bred would relate to.

Srivatsan S no longer bothers to check the chart sheet and is convinced that his co-passengers are a couple in their 50s

It isn’t easy being the younger sibling, but that’s how Egmore has always been treated, in comparison to the Central railway station. Filmmakers go overboard shoving that old clocktower in your face, trying to wring out emotion for ‘Madras’. However, our Egmore has been quietly and efficiently ferrying millions of passengers every year since 1908, when it sprung to life to supplement Central.

Designed by Sir Henry Irwin, this red and white neo-classical structure with its long corridors and clocktower is one of the city’s younger icons. As Chennai’s spoken history goes, it was made out of a British fort that was possibly used to store ammunition. It is iconic in more than one way: until 2004, this station hosted the world’s only meter-gauge suburban train.

Its 11 platforms are where trains bound Southwards, like to Trichy, meet ones bound Northwards, to Hyderabad and Mumbai. According to a 2008 The Hindu report, along these tracks are hollow vertical columns, that were engineered to collect rainwater which was made to flow into a tank. That’s the Egmore style: efficient with no frills or fancies.

For my first four years in Chennai, going to Egmore meant taking one step closer to home, which back then was Mumbai.

To this day, when I find myself at the station commuting for work, I pass by the Dadar-Chennai Egmore Express and can’t help but daydream... what if I bought a ticket and jumped in?

Yes, Egmore may not have Central’s vastness or get the adulation from filmmakers and regular maintenance from the Government that Central does. But that’s what happens when you ignore the younger sibling, and make your firstborn your main project (Mom!)

32,2020/03/09,Three penalties women in the corporate world face for having wombs,"Be it earning sliced salaries or playing catch-up, women who return to work after taking time off to look after their child pay a physical, mental and emotional price

Roshan Rajpal tells the story of a woman who came in for an interview at the Hyatt Hyderabad Gachibowli. A profile check revealed that she was also interviewing at other places. When Roshan asked her about this, the woman revealed that since she had been married two years employers did not want to ‘risk’ giving her a job lest she get pregnant. “She said that as a woman interviewer only I had not asked her this gendered question,” Roshan says.

Today, Roshan herself is a general manager, one of the few in the industry. As someone who began her career at 19 with Holiday Inn and quit at 25 due to family pressure following childbirth, she understands how hard it is for women to both battle and juggle society’s expectations, their family’s — sometimes unspoken but often palpable — demands, their own wants and ambitions and their employers’ biases.

Roshan came back to work after a gap of six years. “The hospitality industry is not very conducive for women to work,” she says. She struggled to find a job, and when she did, with the Carlson group in 2008 and worked for three years, she “put in double the work at a lower salary”. All through, she required her parents’ support and went through separation from her son during his Board exams, after she joined the Crowne Plaza hotel and worked there for eight years and got transferred in 2015 from Bengaluru to Hyderabad. She felt she could not leave her job a second time. She did not want to risk a second motherhood penalty.

Penalty #1: A sliced salary

“Deep-rooted biases in our society compel women to remain the primary caregivers and any attempt on their part to divert from home duties makes them a target of criticism, judgement, and exploitation,” says Neela Kaushik, the founder of Gurgaon Moms and an influencer. A business analyst with Ford Technology in Chennai, she did not find a job when she wanted to return after a three-year break as a stay-at-home mom back in 2008. “I used to be so frustrated because the few opportunities that came by extracted more work at one-third of the salary I had earned earlier,” says the now 41-year-old. Like many women, Neela started an online community that has grown to 33,000 women and is a brand today. She says her aim is to create a safe space for women from where they could network, relaunch themselves, and live their dreams.

Hyderabad-based psychologist MV Lakshmi Devi says women often reinvent themselves. According to her, it is a kind of a catharsis that brings improvement in physical and mental health.

Penalty #2: Dropping out of the workforce

A 2014 International Labour Organization study threw up a horrifying statistic: that 90% of women the world over do not go back to the jobs they held before they became mothers. Archana Talwar (name changed to protect identity), a life coach based in Bengaluru, admits she faced moments when she even felt suicidal, after her inability to get back to her IT job on the same terms and conditions. “Our systems and work culture are still not fine-tuned for a woman. One has to make individual choices. You could accept a low salary, or a loss of pay, or work under someone junior,” she says.

With constant churning of emotions, women go into a state of denial over their health. “They internalise their struggles and do not express their symptoms unless they become visible,” says Lakshmi.

Bridging the gap Sairee Chahal, the CEO of Sheroes, from Delhi, feels women are now understanding their worth and taking proactive steps to start their own enterprises. “The lack of jobs is a trigger in some ways for entrepreneurship and helping women develop their identity as independent professionals,” she says. At the same time, Sairee feels, several progressive businesses are now bringing more empathy into their hiring models.

At the same time, Sairee feels, several progressive businesses are now bringing more empathy into their hiring models. Neha Bagaria from Bengaluru says that after a three-and-a-half-year gap from work, she was beginning to lose confidence. She decided to launch JobsForHer to help women restart their careers. “Motherhood can be very lonely and I realised more than flexible job conditions women look for flexible mindsets,” she says. Yet, she adds, nobody likes to lose a good pool of human resources. Several connecting platforms and communities of diverse kinds of women from leaders and mentors to motivators, guides and co-partners are seeing increased participation now.

Penalty #3: Working harder

When Adyasha N was expecting her baby, she was working with an IT company, but a sabbatical scheme had just been announced. When she wanted to join back after almost 18 months, she suffered a loss of confidence and feared she had not kept pace in skill development; people junior to her had moved ahead. It took her more than three years to cover the gap. “I stayed with my parents to get enough free time to focus on areas I had lost time on. I worked much harder.”

Lakshmi says women keep pushing themselves because they also carry the guilt of either leaving their children in crèches or with parents. Plus, there is the fear about their own savings.

33,2020/03/09,How a Memory Maps project is creating a sense of belonging in Bengaluru,"The soul of the city: How Aliyeh Rizvi and Arzu Mistry, through their Memory Maps project, are attempting to create a sense of belonging to the city

The midmorning sun is warm, indicating the arrival of early summer in Bengaluru. Walkers and joggers at Sankey Tank make their exit. A few latecomers enter, ready to brave the heat. But mostly, the place is vacant. On the steps of the smaller, square tank inside the premises, pigeons outnumber humans. They are perhaps waiting with false hopes for puffed rice or whatever food humans usually throw for them. A few turtles swim on the surface of the water, near the steps, attracting the attention of a child who shrieks, “Tuttle! tuttle!”

The sight is pleasing. This is perhaps how Sankey Tank always looks on Friday mornings.

Outside the tank’s premises, amidst a group clasping small notebooks and pens or pencils, was Harry Kukreja, 54, who has lived all his life near Sankey Tank, in Sadashivnagar. To him, oddly, the sight and even the place is unfamiliar. For, this isn’t the Sankey Tank that existed while he grew up. The smaller tank, for instance, wasn’t there. The main tank itself was much greener and bigger.

One of the places near the now 137-year-old tank was a low-lying vacant strip of land called Deeps. It was a name the locals gave it because the place was, well, deep. According to Kukreja, it was a rainwater catchment area, which was connected to the main tank with a pipe. Growing up, it was a favourite haunt for Kukreja and the other children in his neighbourhood. “We would go there to play cricket, we learnt riding bicycles, motorbikes…” he recalls. Where Deeps was, there is now the Sadashivnagar Park. You might not find Deeps even if you Google it. It doesn’t exist on the internet. It doesn’t exist in the real world. It exists only in the collective memories of a few Sadashivnagar residents.

Walk and workshop

Travel writer Aliyeh Rizvi and artist Arzu Mistry, since the beginning of the 2010s, were working on their projects, separately. Aliyeh was busy with Native Place (which was about building awareness on Bengaluru’s history and culture through walks) and Arzu with Art in Transit (which was about starting a dialogue about the city through art). Both received positive responses for their projects. When, in 2016, they collaborated for the first time, it didn’t take long to figure out that their works shared the same objective: connecting people and the city. So, for the next two years, they devised what they now call Memory Maps.

Memory Maps is a walk-workshop combination that helps people foster a sense of belonging to the city (read the box to know how). It asks people to be psychogeographers (definition on the other box). It encourages people to take a stroll around the city; investigate its alleys, roads, lakes, parks and buildings; and get lost in it.

Why it’s good to get lost

With the aid of our smart devices, we are increasingly getting quicker, more efficient in getting from one point to another. But we might lose our agency if we mindlessly pursue convenience and efficiency. The sophisticated algorithms that Facebook or Google deploy will determine where we go and what we do within a city.

“Google maps don’t allow us to get lost,” says Arzu. “Of course, it makes navigation easier. But it doesn’t leave room for curiosity. When you are lost, you feel confused. But that confusion causes you to explore.”

Aliyeh concurs. “The real essence of travel comes from a (physical) map and not an app. Getting lost is an adventure. And apps don’t allow us to do that.”

Aliyeh, who was born and brought up in Bengaluru, has always liked walking. It helps her observe and register, at her own pace, buildings, streets, people, shops, statues, et al. — these things are essential for her as a writer of travel, history, and culture. “And, Bangalore, especially, is meant for walking. We keep complaining of the city’s traffic. But this city was never meant for so many cars; it was a small cantonment city meant for pedestrians and carriages.”

Covering the city

An important part of Aliyeh and Arzu’s Memory Maps is walking. But the duo clarify that they don’t conduct a heritage walk; “it is more interpretative, where you observe and think about things.” So far, they have covered Cubbon Park, Malleshwaram, Richmond Town and, recently, Sadashivnagar, as a part of the City Scripts event organised by IIHS, in which Kukreja participated. The demography of the participants keeps varying. For instance, the Cubbon Park Memory Maps had mostly natives of Bengaluru, whereas the Sadashivnagar edition had only a handful of people who were born and brought up in the city.

After every edition of Memory Maps, Aliyeh and Arzu compile the participants’ maps into a book. Arzu and Aliyeh want to take their project not only to more places but also to more communities.

For instance, they have tied up with the transgender community, Aravani Art Project, for their next Memory Map edition.

Sitaram Sujir, a psychologist, was one of the participants of Memory Walks at Sadashivnagar. He has been living in Bengaluru for the last two decades. Still, the city, he says, appears new to him, everyday. “Irrespective of the number of years you live in a city, you don’t always explore it fully. I want to do that. I stay in Sanjaynagar but I want to meet people from other parts of the city, get to know their stories.” It is the reason why he signed up for Memory Maps.

“I wish to do a similar project in my hometown, Mangalore,” he says, “There is this Venkataramana temple, which is 250 years old. As per tradition, every year, the deity used to be taken through seven towns within the city. But these towns don’t exist any more.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/v68xur/article31021531.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGM-MEMORYMAPS6,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-a-memory-maps-project-is-creating-a-sense-of-belonging-in-bengaluru/article31021534.ece
34,2020/03/09,Oil crashes after Saudi Arabia launches price war,"The price of petrol and diesel are likely to come down further in the coming weeks as India follows the monthly average pricing of the benchmark crude oil.

The state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) have reduced the price of sensitive petroleum products like petrol by 24 to 27 paise a litre and diesel by 24 to 26 paise a litre across major cities as the price of international crude oil fell the greatest amount in a day since 1991 Gulf war.

Brent crude futures fell by as much as $14.25, or 31.5%, to $31.02 a barrel, the most since 1991 on March 9 after Saudi Arabia started a price war with Russia by slashing its selling prices and pledging to unleash its pent-up supply on to a market reeling from falling demand due to the spread of Coronavirus.

Petrol prices in Delhi decreased by ₹0.24 to ₹70.59 per litre and diesel dropped by ₹0.25 to rest at ₹63.26 per litre in Delhi, according to Indian Oil Corporation data.

In Mumbai, petrol prices were cut by ₹0.27 and are now retailing at ₹76.29 per litre. Diesel prices on the other hand stand at ₹66.24 a litre after witnessing a price cut of ₹0.26 from last day’s prices.

The price of petrol and diesel have come down by around ₹5 each since beginning of this year.

In Kolkata, petrol is retailing at ₹73.28 a litre, down 23 paise compared with yesterday’s price of ₹73.51 a litre, and a litre of diesel will cost ₹65.59, 25 paise less than yesterday’s rate.

Similarly in Chennai, local prices of petrol and diesel are ₹73.33 (25 paise less) a litre and ₹66.75 (26 paise decrease) a litre respectively.

35,2020/03/09,U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper’s India trip on,"There were doubts over the proposed visit due to the threat posed by COVID-19.

The visit of US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper to New Delhi is scheduled for March 15 and 16 and preparations are on, officials sources said on Monday.

There were doubts over the proposed visit due to the threat posed by COVID-19.

The details were decided at a coordination meeting between Defence Ministry and U.S. Embassy officials at South Block in the morning, two defence officials independently confirmed. Defence Ministry is in the process of finalising the protocol, one of the officials stated.

With COVID-19 spreading across the globe, the India-US Military Cooperation Group (MCG) dialogue also scheduled for later this month has been cancelled due to which there were questions on this proposed visit too.

The visit by Mr. Esper comes close after the visit of US President Donald Trump early this month. Mr. Esper will hold discussions with his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh and it will be an opportunity for the two sides to review the decisions taken during this Mr. Trumps visit and also during other visits recently, official sources said.

India signed deals worth $3 bn for 24 MH-60R Seahawk Multi-Role Helicopters and six AH-64E Apache attack helicopters during Mr. Trump’s visit. Indian Navy is keen on accelerating the deliveries of the Seahawks given their critical requirement and this is likely to come up for discussion. Maritime Domain Awareness has emerged as a major focus between the two countries and also for cooperation with other regional countries with the Navies at the forefront of the effort.

Along the joint development efforts under the Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI), the progress on the negotiations over the last foundational agreement, Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-spatial Cooperation (BECA) will also be reviewed, an official stated adding there was impetus on both sides for its early conclusion.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/x7fqrq/article30473945.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-SYRIA-POLITICS-DEFENSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/us-defence-secretary-mark-espers-india-trip-on/article31026197.ece
36,2020/03/09,Govt. explains the need for a new Parliament building,"State of building, lack of office space cited as reasons for the proposed revamp

The government last week informed Parliament that the building it functions out of is “showing signs of distress and over utilization”, which is one of the reasons for the proposed construction of a new Parliament House.

Congress MP Anand Sharma had asked the government the reason for the proposed redevelopment of the three-km-long Central Vista from Rashtrapati Bhavan till India Gate, and the construction of a new Parliament building and a common Central Secretariat, which was announced in October last year. He also sought to know the total expenditure of the project.

Responding to the question on March 4, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri informed the Rajya Sabha that the construction of the Parliament building began in 1921 and it was commissioned in 1927. “Over the years, the parliamentary activities and the number of people working therein and visitors have increased manifold. Hence, the building is showing signs of distress and over utilization. Further, with the reorganization of constituencies, the number of Lok Sabha seats is likely to go up and the present building does not have any space to house any additional member,” the Minister’s reply read.

He added that the additional office space in the newly constructed Parliament Annexe and library building was “insufficient to meet the requirements”.

Also read | 8 new buildings likely under new Central Vista

The Minister’s response comes at a time when the Central Public Works Department has filed for environmental clearance and change of land-use for the project, which is facing legal challenges. The Delhi High Court on March 6 transferred the cases related to the Central Vista project to the Supreme Court.

Apart from constructing a new Parliament adjacent to the existing one, the government is also working on developing a common Central Secretariat for all Ministries along the Central Vista. Currently, the Ministries are spread over 47 buildings, the Minister said, adding that there was a shortfall of 3.8 lakh sq m of office space. He said the expenditure on the project would be worked out once the drawings for the buildings were finalised.

However, in its application for environment clearance on February 12, the CPWD had said that the project’s proposed cost would be ₹776 crore.

In his reply, the Minister said the existing Parliament building would be used for other activities after it is “structurally rehabilitated and renovated”.

Experts, however, have questioned the lack of assessment of the project’s potential impact. The chairperson of the Indian Institute of Architects, Northern chapter, Shamit Manchanda, said there were non-destructive testing methods, including using ultrasonic waves, to assess a building’s structural stability.

“We are not saying that the government should not carry out the project, it’s their prerogative, but they should carry out the assessments, including of the project’s environmental impact. It seems that they have a proposal and now they are trying to justify it,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ryj4y/article30453519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01PARLIAMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-explains-the-need-for-a-new-parliament-building/article31026069.ece
37,2020/03/09,Supreme Court commutes death penalty citing convict’s mental state,"Accused killed three children ‘in revenge’ after his wife eloped

The Supreme Court has commuted the death sentence of a man who murdered three children aged between eight and four, concluding that he was suffering from “extreme mental disturbance” at the time of the “abominable crime”.

A three-judge Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit, Indira Banerjee and M.R. Shah said the convict was motivated by revenge. He was unable to bear the blow of his wife’s elopement with the children’s uncle.

The March 5, 2020 judgment comes even as the Centre has been repeatedly seeking the intervention of the Supreme Court against condemned men misusing the legal process to have their death sentence commuted to life imprisonment. In his oral arguments in the Nirbhaya case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had recently submitted that legal process in death penalty cases should also be victim-centric.

“It is true that a larger number of criminals go unpunished, thereby increasing criminals in society and law losing its deterrent effect… It is true that the court must respond to the cry of society and settle what would be the deterrent punishment for an abominable crime… Sometimes it is stated that only rights of criminals are kept in mind and the victims are forgotten,” Justice Shah, who wrote the 68-page judgment for the Bench, acknowledged.

However, Justice Shah said death penalty was a rarest of rare punishment. While awarding death, the courts must strike a balance between the mitigating and aggravating factors, which depend on the facts and circumstances of each particular case. In this case, the mental state of the convict, Manoj Suryavanshi, trumped over the aggravating factor that his crime was an “abominable” one.

No remission

However, the top court, sentencing him to life imprisonment, said he would not be eligible for remission for the next 25 years.

The crime occurred in 2011 in Chhattisgarh. The children went missing while walking home from school. One of the witnesses told the father that they were last seen with Manoj Suryavanshi. The trial court had sentenced him to death on the same day he was convicted of the crime.

“The accused was emotionally disturbed due to the elopement of his wife with the uncle of the deceased children and that his children were suffering in the absence of their mother...” Justice Shah observed.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/lvpp26/article30706973.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-supreme-court-of-indiaasjdhsakldasd,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-commutes-death-penalty-citing-convicts-mental-state/article31026063.ece

Naga interlocutor R.N Ravi, who is also the Governor of Nagaland, held yet another round of meetings with Naga groups in Delhi to bring a lasting solution to the peace accord. The last round of such discussions were held in October last year.

Mr. Ravi held detailed discussions with members of Naga National Political Groups (NNPG) in the past three days. The members of the group urged the interlocutor to sign the final peace accord though the NSCN-IM does not come on board.

Mr. Ravi had earlier accused the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) — one of the largest Naga groups with which the Centre had signed a framework agreement on August 3, 2015 — of delaying the talks to find a solution to the decades-old Naga issue.

The NSCN-IM has been fighting for ‘Greater Nagaland’ or Nagalim — it wants to extend Nagaland’s borders by including Naga-dominated areas in neighbouring Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh — to unite 1.2 million Nagas.

Also read | Analysis: Several obstacles on the political front in Jammu and Kashmir

He also dismissed suggestions that Mr. Bukhari’s party was a “B” team of the BJP.

“There is a large section of political dispensation in the Valley which has been longing to resume political activities. We only see this new development as an expression of their desire for normal political activities,” said Mr. Madhav.

“For the BJP, we always wanted normal political activities in the Valley too. But our focus will be on expanding our footprints as BJP. I don’t want to comment on the prospects of the new party. We as BJP will continue our activities in the Valley,” he said.

The statement also comes on a day when a joint statement by the opposition signed by many leaders, including Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar, former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury demanding the immediate release of three former Chief Ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, who have been incarcerated since August 5, the day the Union government moved a Bill rescinding Article 370.

Key demand

According to senior sources in the BJP however, start of political activity was a key demand of its own Jammu unit that felt that like before Jammu was being penalised for issues only affecting the Valley. The Union government has notified a delimitation commission for Jammu and Kashmir as per the 2011 census. “The delimitation commission will take at least a year or more to finalise its report, we want political activity to start and every move made to have Assembly polls thereafter,” said a senior BJP leader.

41,2020/03/09,"‘There was complete dereliction of duty by police’, says Sandeep Dikshit","In a matter of two or three hours, one flag march, lathi charge, things would have been normal, says Congress leader

Former East Delhi MP and Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit was among the first to visit the areas of north-east Delhi hit by communal violence two weeks ago. Excerpts:

You visited the violence-hit areas of north-east Delhi. What did you find there?

I was being told that this is some anti-CAA [Citizenship (Amendment) Act], pro-CAA supporters locally and people trying to muscle down the other. But on [February] 24, things suddenly started going wrong. So, I tried to contact my people and go there sometime in the evening. I found that some of the areas blocked so I quickly came back. On [February] 25 I randomly went from place to place; Muslim-dominated, Hindu-dominated, mixed population areas. There was a sense of panic and fear in both communities. There was some anger in the Hindu community; they had this sense that the protests [against the CAA] had gone on too long. Then came [BJP leader] Kapil Mishra speech. I think he used a platform where there were police people standing around him to give a very clear message as to who is with us.

Also read: Comment | What Kejriwal should have done

What about the police role?

Initially, it was a case of masterly inactivity, followed by biased assistance towards one community. The police don’t have to wait for any order when there is a clear case of violation of law and order in front of you. They are duty-bound by their oath to intervene and that is something they just didn’t do. So either they were given explicit instructions not to do anything when things go bad or there was fear in them that they cannot retaliate against particular communities, because a government favours a particular community. But very clearly, it was complete dereliction of duty. You know, there are two huge Rapid Force [Rapid Action Force] camps [in the area and these men] could have been called within five minutes. So it was a case of dereliction of duty, but it literally turned into wilful abuse of law and neutrality.

Also read: No country for protesters?

In your view, where does the buck stop?

I think the first is the kind of a political atmosphere we have seen. Secondly, I would put it squarely on the [former] police commissioner. Amulya Patnaik has gone out dishonourably. It was a matter of two to three hours, one flag march, one lathi charge, a few tear gas shells in every area and things would have been completely normal.

What about the AAP government? They say the police do not fall under them.

If Aam Aadmi Party government [functionaries] had come out onto the streets, none of this would have happened. You have your SDMs [Sub-Divisional Magistrates] and your Collectors. If they had started moving in the area, none of this would have happened. If [Chief Minister] Arvind Kejriwal and others were travelling around in their cavalcade in these areas you really think police would have been inactive? Can the police remain inactive if the Chief Minister is travelling? Mr. Kejriwal knew that he had the Muslim vote with him and can probably play the role of a leader of both communities in his larger national ambitions. He is hunting with the hound and running with the hare. When you become too clever by half, this is what happens. Delhi was not a vote against communalism but a vote for free power, electricity. And many people misread that as him presenting some new kind of a secular hope.

Also read: Comment | As Delhi burned, institutions looked away

The Congress ruled Delhi for 15 years, but the party was not visible anywhere in north-east Delhi.

I think that’s not correct. The peace march in Sundarnagri, Seemapuri, Gokulpuri were taken out by my ex-corporators, block presidents, but they were not participating as Congress people. You know, that case of a Masjid where they planted a [saffron] flag. When the crowd came, two Hindu families came out and fought the crowd, both Congress workers. One was the block president of the Congress and the other is a Congress worker.

India is ready to work with Bangladesh to stop the spread of COVID-19, which prompted cancellation of the inauguration ceremony of the birth centenary celebrations of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Dhaka.

A statement from External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar on Monday confirmed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, scheduled to participate in the March 17 event, would not travel to Dhaka. He said Bangladesh had formally communicated that the authorities were forced to “defer” the event in the prevailing health scenario in Bangladesh. “While expressing understanding of the circumstances that necessitates this deferment, India is ready to work with Bangladesh, as partners, to combat the spread of this disease in our shared neighbourhood,” said Mr. Kumar.

Authorities in Dhaka detected three cases of COVID-19 on Sunday which led to widespread panic in the country. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina assured people that her government was capable of meeting the public health emergency. This was followed by a meeting of the celebrations committee of the “Mujib Year” after which the mega event, to be held in the Parade Ground of Dhaka, was cancelled.

“The Government of Bangladesh has advised us that fresh dates for these commemorative events will be conveyed later,” said Mr. Kumar.

Underlining the Centre’s preparedness to deal with COVID-19, Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers D.V. Sadananda Gowda on Monday said there was sufficient stock of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) for the next three months.

As soon as this news came out from China [about the novel coronavirus outbreak], we had a meeting with all the industrialists, pharma industrialists, and we took stock of the API. It is more than sufficient for another three months, Mr. Gowda told reporters.

The Union Minister said recently at the Pharma-2020 conclave in Ahmedabad that the pharma companies had assured him that there was no need to worry about the coronavirus (COVID-19).

In China also, apart from the two affected districts, other districts have started manufacturing API, he added.

Mr. Gowda, however, conceded that India did not take much interest in the earlier days for this formation of API parks, pharma parks and drug parks across the country.

Now, we have planned for that. We are going to have six mega pharma powers in various corners of the country, including one in Raichur, he said.

Mr. Gowda ruled out scarcity of masks or drugs to deal with COVID-19.

“I will tell you, there are two aspects. One is black-marketing and another is sending this false propaganda [about shortage]. I don’t think there is any scarcity. Of course, it has appeared in the newspapers,” the Minister said.

Following the reports, searches were carried out and some black-marketeers were found, said Mr. Gowda adding that everything has been resolved.

46,2020/03/09,Implement pay hike for subordinate judiciary ‘proactively’: Supreme Court,"No price is too heavy to secure independence of judiciary, it tells States and UTs

A Supreme Court Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde has made it clear to the States and Union Territories that recommendations made by the Second National Judicial Pay Commission to nearly triple the pay and allowances for subordinate judiciary should be implemented ‘proactively’.

The Supreme Court highlighted, in its February 28, 2020 order, that a financially self-sufficient subordinate judiciary was pivotal for the existence of an independent judiciary.

“Self-reliance is the foundation of independence. The society has a stake in ensuring the independence of the judiciary, and no price is too heavy to secure it. To keep the Judges in want of essential accoutrements and thus to impede them in the proper discharge of their duties, is to impair and whittle away justice itself,” the court quoted from its judgment in the All India Judges Association case.

The original judgment in 1992 saw the apex court direct the States and the Union Territories to separately examine and review the pay structure of judicial officers as and when the States constitute pay commissions for its employees. In its review verdict in 1993, it specifically held that “judicial service is not a service in the sense of ‘employment’ and judges are not employees”.

The case became the basis for sustained efforts over the years to improve the service conditions of subordinate judicial officers. The latest Second Pay Commission report has suggested a revised pay structure for them. For example, the Commission has recommended that the starting pay for a Junior Civil Judge/First Class Magistrate should be hiked from ₹27,700 to ₹77,840. The Commission’s report was filed in the Supreme Court on January 29, 2020.

On February 28, Chief Justice Bobde’s Bench said despite judgments from the Supreme Court and interventions over the years, the States and Union Territories still do not spare enough for their judges. The Bench reproduced a table in its order to demonstrate that subordinate judiciary gets only .44% of the total expenditure of States and Union Territories. The Bench said this was both “inadequate and negligible”.

The apex court has now asked the State governments and the Union to file their responses to the Second Pay Commission’s recommendations within four weeks, if not, it would be presumed that they have outright accepted the Commission’s terms.

The apex court also appointed senior advocate P.S. Narasimha and advocate K. Parameshwar as amici curiae to intervene on the Supreme Court’s behalf. The States and the Union Territories would provide them with a copy of their responses to the Commission’s recommendations.

More importantly, the Bench has asked Mr. Narasimha and Mr. Parameshwar to evolve “institutional mechanisms to ensure that this Court is not compelled to intervene every time in respect of pay scales and conditions of service in respect of the subordinate judiciary”. The court has asked the Union Law Secretary to give his suggestions in this regard to the amici.

The court ordered the States to be represented by the Chief Secretaries in the next hearing. They shall be represented by their respective Advocates General.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4t4emi/article30999222.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/implement-pay-hike-for-subordinate-judiciary-proactively-supreme-court/article31023845.ece

The Opposition on Monday called for the immediate release of all political detainees in Kashmir, especially Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti who have been detained for about seven months on “flimsiest of grounds”.

Also read | Mehbooba Mufti, other detainees being shifted to warmer locations

In a joint statement, six Opposition leaders including NCP president Sharad Pawar, West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress president Mamata Banerjee, Janata Dal (Secular) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI general secretary D. Raja, Rashtriya Janata Dal MP (Rajya Sabha) Manoj Kumar Jha, besides two former Ministers from the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government — Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie — termed these detentions as a blatant violation of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

Saying India and the Constitution have always stood for “unity in diversity” with everybody’s views respected, honoured and heard, the statement said in the Narendra Modi-led government “democratic dissent is being muzzled by coercive administrative action, which has threatened the basic ideals of Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity as enshrined in our Constitution”.

There are growing assaults on democratic norms, fundamental rights and civic liberties of citizens of the Indian Republic, it said, adding that as a result, dissent is not only being stifled, but the avenues of raising critical voices are also being systematically muted.

“Nothing exemplifies this more starkly than the continuing detention, on flimsiest of grounds, of three former Chief Ministers of Jammu & Kashmir — Dr. Farooq Abdullah, Shri Omar Abdullah and Smt.

There is nothing in the past records of these three leaders to lend credence to the Modi government’s false and self-serving claim that they pose a threat to ‘public safety’ in J&K or that they have endangered national interests with their activities,” it said.

The statement said the BJP itself had in the past allied with all three of them both at the Centre (with the National Conference) and in the State (with the Peoples Democratic Party). The very validity of the Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act (PSA), 1978 can be challenged following the abrogation of Article 370 as the State has now been stripped off its Special Status, it added.

Air India Express on March 9 said passengers can reschedule their tickets free of cost for all bookings made between March 12-31, in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak.

The airline, the budget arm of national carrier Air India, flies to 13 international destinations, mostly in the Gulf region.

“In view of the uncertain travel situation due to COVID-19, free date change will be permitted up to three days prior to the flight departure, for all new bookings effected between March 12, 2020 to March 31, 2020, for travel up to April 30, 2020,” the airline said in a statement.

Cancellations charge would be applicable.

Many countries have imposed travel restrictions, amid the outbreak of coronavirus, which has claimed thousands of lives.

The carrier operates over 660 flights every week to 12 destinations in Gulf countries, including Dubai and Bahrain, besides Singapore. It also has around eight domestic connections per week.

Following the coronavirus outbreak, the airline has reduced the number of its flights to Singapore and has suspended services to Kuwait, an airline official said. The official also said flights to Doha are likely to be cancelled as the Gulf nation has banned entry of people from India and 13 other countries due to coronavirus scare.

Among other countries, Saudi Arabia has also put in place travel restrictions. Passengers holding Umrah visa and tourist visa have been barred from travelling to Saudi Arabia.

On Sunday, GoAir said it would not charge any fee on cancellation or rescheduling of tickets booked till April 30. This would be applicable for all bookings made between March 8 and April 30 and for the travel period between March 8 and September 30.

The zero cancellation and rebooking fee offer can be availed if done up to 14 days before departure, GoAir had said.

Bangladesh has postponed the main inaugural programme marking Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary to be held on March 17.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to attend the event.

Kamal Abdul Naser Chowdhury, the chief coordinator of the committee to implement year-long birth centenary programmes, said that the decision was taken after three cases of COVID-19 surfaced in Bangladesh.

“A large gathering was expected at the National Parade Ground on March 17. But considering the situation, we have decided to postpone it,” Mr. Chowdhury, a senior bureaucrat, told The Hindu. He, however, indicated that the event was “postponed and not cancelled”.

“We have a meeting in which we will decide how — and to what scale — we will mark March 17 [the 100th birth anniversary of Mujibur Rahman] and about the future event,” Mr. Chowdhury said.

While both sides have not officially announced the cancellation of his scheduled trip on March 17, the postponement entails that Mr. Modi’s Bangladesh visit “stands cancelled for now”, said a source.

“The Foreign Ministry [of Bangladesh] will be able to clarify about the visit,” Mr. Chowdhury said.

Protests against visit

Last week, large-scale protests were witnessed in Dhaka against Mr. Modi’s visit.

Dhaka University students’ union vice-president Nurul Haq told international press that they would demonstrate against Mr. Modi’s visit, “whenever he is in town.”

“We will try to stop the visit, at any cost. We may march from university to airport or demonstrate around Indian High Commission,” he said last week.

Considering the situation, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla visited the country to discuss about the Prime Minister’s visit last week.

Mr. Chowdhury said other programmes, scheduled throughout the year, would continue as per plan.

The Bangladesh government will update the Indian government about “the new programme plans and schedules connected to Mr. Modi’s future visit,” said a source.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5h89nq/article31022336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001PQ0WO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mujibur-rahmans-birth-centenary-programme-postponed-pm-modi-may-not-visit-bangladesh/article31022337.ece

“The patient is admitted at Government Medical College and Hospital in Amritsar and his condition is stable,” he added.

“The patient has been kept in isolation after he was found to be symptomatic on his arrival at the International Airport in Amritsar,” said Mr. Sidhu.

Five persons including a three-year-old child, suspected to have symptoms of COVID-19, were shifted to the isolation ward of the Government Medical College in Kollam. All of them fall into high-risk category as they belong to the house and neighbourhood of the family in Punalur visited by the COVID-19 positive persons from Pathanamthitta.

The J&K administration also confirmed the first positive case in the Union Territory. Officials said a 50-year-old woman, a resident of Kargil, had travelled to Iran on a pilgrimage. “She remains in an isolation ward in the Government Medical College, Jammu. Another patient’s sample has been sent for re-test,” said an official. The condition of the patient has been termed “stable”.

J&K government spokesman Rohit Kansal said, “The situation is under constant watch. Around 400 persons are under surveillance in Satawari and Sarwal areas of Jammu (where the woman was staying). Several Anganwadi centers in these areas have been closed till March 3.”

“Of the over 3,003 samples, 44 have tested positive out for COVID-19; 2,694 samples returned negative results,” Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said after a meeting of stakeholders, including Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.

He added that the country could not afford to be complacent. “We have to prepare now to ensure that we are able to take care of patient load,’’ he said.

Dr. Vardhan stressed the need for coordinated action for contact tracing, community surveillance, hospital management, identification of isolation wards, ensuring adequate personal protection equipment and masks and risk communication .",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jaenpa/article31022185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/covid19-delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-four-new-cases-reported-total-number-43-says-health-ministry/article31022186.ece

The Delhi government has maintained that 53 people were killed and over 200 injured in the communal violence that broke out in northeast areas of the city last month.

52,2020/03/09,COVID-19: Telcos using caller tune to spread awareness,"It also sought a direction to telcos “to send bulk SMS/PUSH notification on the simple dos and don’ts to all the clients”.

The government has ordered all telecom firms to make a 30-second audio clip on coronavirus as a caller tune of mobile phone users to create awareness among masses — an order that state-owned BSNL and Reliance Jio have fully complied with while other telcos are yet to follow.

Top sources said on a request from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) ordered superseding of the phone ringing tone that one hears on dialling a number, with the 30-second information clip.

Explained: How is India containing COVID-19?

The only exception to not hearing the coronavirus message is when a user has subscribed to a particular tune, they said.

All telcos were asked to incorporate the coronavirus ringing tone but so far only state-owned BSNL and Reliance Jio are in full compliance. The other telcos have cited technical issues for part implementation, they said.

The DoT had on Friday sent email instructions to all telcos to make the coronavirus audio clip as the ‘ring back tone’ to help disseminate information to masses. The order asked telcos to “incorporate audio clips in ring back tone of each subscribers on urgent basis from today till further orders”.

This followed a letter from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to the Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash on March 5 on disseminating pertinent information on coronavirus through all channels of communication and from all possible vantage points. “You are requested to ask the telecom firms to make use of a 30-second audio we have developed as the pre-call notification for a period of three days,” the letter said.

It also sought a direction to telcos “to send bulk SMS/PUSH notification on the simple dos and don’ts to all the clients”.

It further sought the telecom secretary’s personal monitoring to ensure mechanisms are in place for successful dissemination of messages. The ministry’s request to the DoT came as part of steps to create awareness to prevent spread of the disease and advocate simple public health measures that people can take to prevent infection.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vu9aez/article31021830.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI05-03-2020000098A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-telcos-using-caller-tune-to-spread-awareness/article31021831.ece
53,2020/03/09,‘Plurals’ pops up in Bihar,"As the Bihar Assembly election is months away, it was a call from a party which declared its president Pushpam Priya Choudhary the chief ministerial candidate

On International Women’s Day, people of Bihar woke up to a two-page advertisement in most of the newspapers on Sunday. It read, “Plurals has arrived,” with the tag-line, “Love Bihar, Hate Politics”.

As the Bihar Assembly election is months away, it was a call from a party which declared its president Pushpam Priya Choudhary the chief ministerial candidate.

“You focus on climbing the ladder, and let us deal with the snakes,” said Pushpam Priya Choudhary, president of Plurals.

The party says in the advertisement that it enters the election because “Bihar Deserves Better, And Better is Possible”. Earlier, none had heard the name of the party or that of its president.

The advertisement in a local edition of a national English daily also carried a photograph of Pushpam Priya Choudhary, leaning on a table with a bookshelf in the background. It said, “Plurals — everyone governs. Love Bihar, Hate Politics — join the most progressive political party.”

“Join me to take the power back,” it added, detailing Pushpam Priya Choudhary’s social media accounts and a toll-free number (1800-313-0082) which, when dialled, kept saying, “You seem to have dialled the wrong number. Please check the number you’ve dialled”.

In the second page, she has posted her another picture sitting beneath a statue of Mahatma Gandhi. “The Revolution has begun — A party that manifests positive politics & policy making,” said the advertisement with another tag-line, “Take interest, to control politics, else it will continue to control you”.

She has also shown her educational background as “MA Development Studies — Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, UK” and Master of Public Administration — London School of Economics & Political Science, UK”.

In a signed letter written in Hindi, she has said a “chief ministerial candidate is writing to her fellow citizens”. “Keep it carefully because it is a guarantee for a better future for you and your children... The future which you were to get from your childhood... I’m here to return you that future...,” she said.

She has pledged to make Bihar “the most developed State of the country by 2025 and its development index as good as any European country by 2030”. “Plurals is not only a political movement, but an exercise to make the country disease-free, and this exercise begins with an effort to make the heart of the country disease-free,” she adds in the letter addressed to “Dear friends”.

Pushpam Priya Choudhary is daughter of former JD(U) MLC from the Darbhanga Graduate constituency Vinod Kumar Choudhary. A professor of sociology, Mr. Choudhary hails from New Balbhadrapur area of Laheriyasarai in Darbhanga district. He has been politically and socially active there for several years. His father Umakant Choudhary was also in politics and said to be close to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar during their Samata Party days. Several calls to Mr. Vinod Kumar Choudhary were not returned.

Leaders across parties were surprised. “Yes, I was really surprised to see the picture of a young lady claiming herself as chief ministerial candidate and appealing to the people to join her party with catchy tag-lines,” said a senior Congress leader.

A JD(U) leader said, “I didn’t know she was the daughter of Vinod Kumar Choudhary, who was our MLC in 2014,” he said.

A BJP leader from Mithilanchal quipped, “I hope PK [election strategist Prashant Kishor] is not behind all this.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/plurals-pops-up-in-bihar/article31018474.ece
54,2020/03/09,"Over 40% govt. schools don’t have power, playgrounds: parliamentary panel","Parliamentary panel identifies shortfalls in budgetary funding and utilisation, resulting in critical infrastructure gaps

Almost half of government schools in the country don’t have any electricity or playgrounds, according to a parliamentary panel on education. It identified shortfalls in both budgetary funding and utilisation, resulting in critical infrastructure gaps.

Also read: Comment | Chalk and cheese in private vs. government schools

In its report on the 2020-2021 demand for grants for school education submitted to the Rajya Sabha last week, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Resource Development (HRD) expressed concern that budgetary allocations saw a 27% cut from proposals made by the School Education department. Despite proposals for ₹82,570 crore, only ₹59,845 crore was allocated. Noting similar 27% reductions for the Central and Centrally Sponsored Schemes as well, the panel recommended that these core schemes get additional funds at the revised estimates stage.

Stark deficits

The panel “expressed dismay” at the stark deficits in government school infrastructure, citing the latest survey data.

Only 56% of schools have electricity, with the lowest rates in Manipur and Madhya Pradesh, where less than 20% have access to power. Less than 57% of schools have playgrounds, including less than 30% of schools in Odisha and Jammu and Kashmir, according to the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) 2017-18 survey. Almost 40% of schools did not have a boundary wall, endangering the safety of students and school property.

The panel recommended that the HRD Ministry collaborate with the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) to construct boundary walls, and work with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to provide solar energy and other renewable energy sources so that schools have access to power.

‘Dismal progress’

The parliamentary panel also slammed the government for its “dismal” rate of progress in building classrooms, labs and libraries to strengthen government higher secondary schools. Out of 2,613 sanctioned projects for 2019-20, only three had been completed in the first nine months of the financial year, said the panel, warning that such delays would alienate students from government schools.

In government higher secondary schools, not a single additional classroom had been built by December 31, 2019, although 1,021 had been sanctioned for the financial year 2019-20. Only three laboratories had been built — one each for physics, chemistry and biology — despite sanctioned funds for 1,343 labs. Although 135 libraries and 74 art/craft/culture rooms had been sanctioned, none had been built with just three months left in the financial year.

The record is better at secondary schools, where 70-75% of such facilities had been finished by December, although less than 5% of the facilities aimed at disabled students — ramps and special toilets — had been completed. At primary schools, there was a 90-95% record of infrastructure completion.

Samagra Shiksha Scheme

Overall, for the core Samagra Shiksha Scheme, the department had only spent 71% of revised estimates by December 31, 2019.

“The committee would like to impress upon the department to look into the factors impeding the infrastructure development and resolve them at the earliest so as to ensure that the students get the best possible facilities,” said the report, recommending that the Centre replicate the model of States which have done well in creating and maintaining such facilities.

“The committee is aware of the fact that delay in completion of infrastructure not only leads to students getting alienated from the government schools but also leads to cost overruns and cause an additional strain on the financial resources of the country,” the report said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/ijfoyd/article31017467.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-school-gr,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/over-40-govt-schools-dont-have-power-playgrounds-parliamentary-panel/article31016879.ece
55,2020/03/09,Former Law Minister Bharadwaj is no more,"He also served as Karnataka Governor

H.R. Bharadwaj, India’s second longest serving Law Minister, former Karnataka Governor and veteran Congress leader, passed away after a cardiac arrest here on Sunday. He was 83 and is survived by his wife, a son and two daughters. He had been admitted to a private hospital here for kidney-related ailments.

Mr. Bharadwaj first entered the Rajya Sabha in 1982, and was elected to the Upper House five times. He was Minister of State for Law and Justice in the governments led by Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and P.V. Narasimha Rao until he became a Cabinet Minister holding that portfolio between 2004 and 2009 in the Manmohan Singh Ministry.

Mr. Bharadwaj’s start in politics came in the late 1970s when he came into contact with Indira Gandhi. He enjoyed a position of trust with most of the Prime Ministers he served under and was known for some deft political handling of legal challenges facing the government.

As Law Minister, he introduced gram ‘nyayalayas’, or rural courts, but it was his political handling of certain other cases such as defreezing of Ottavio Quattrochi’s bank accounts, made famous in the Bofors case, that made the headlines.

In 2009, he was made Governor of Karnataka where he accorded sanction to prosecute Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in the Bellary mining case.

56,2020/03/09,PM Modis’s social media swap gets thumbs up,"Women achievers took turns to handle Modi’s accounts on various platforms

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday marked International Women’s Day by handing over control of his social media accounts to seven women achievers who spoke about the issues and causes close to their heart.

This follows his announcement last week that he was thinking of giving up his social media accounts. That turned out to be a teaser for Sunday’s celebrations.

Since morning, from Sneha Mohandoss, who runs FoodBank India, to Veena Devi, sarpanch of a village in Munger district of Bihar, whose venture of growing mushrooms changed her life, and Arifa from Jammu and Kashmir, who has revived the traditional Namda craft of carpet weaving, seven achievers in turns took over the Prime Minister’s Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram accounts.

Malavika Iyer, who managed to complete her Ph.D. despite losing her hands in a bomb blast, got a much-coveted follow-back from the Prime Minister’s Twitter account at the end of her turn at tweeting.

Massive response

The videos posted by the women achievers were also broadcast through the IGTV vertical screen viewing format of Instagram and had garnered a huge viewership on that platform.

Ms. Iyer’s video, for instance, garnered more than 3.5 lakh views within a couple of hours of posting.

The Prime Minister has a following of 35.5 million on Instagram.

On YouTube, where Mr. Modi has 4.54 million subscribers, these videos gathered traction. Officials told The Hindu that the choice of women achievers was made by the Prime Minister himself from a nomination process invited publicly.

In the morning, just before signing off for the day, Mr. Modi had posted a message for the event. “Greetings on International Women’s Day! We salute the spirit and accomplishments of our Nari Shakti. As I’d said a few days ago, I’m signing off. Throughout the day, seven women achievers will share their life journeys and perhaps interact with you through my social media accounts,” he tweeted.

There were some cheeky responses too, with one social media follower on Twitter, @vikrantbhadaur6, asking Ms. Mohandoss for Mr. Modi’s Twitter password. She replied, “New India...try logging in :).”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/4s4cgv/article31017541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-pm-gr,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-modiss-social-media-swap-gets-thumbs-up/article31017628.ece
57,2020/03/09,Ball set rolling for civic polls in Guntur,"19 seats reserved for BCs, 16 for women

After 10 years, local body polls are being held in Guntur throwing up interesting possibilities. The term of the last elected council of the Guntur Municipal Corporation expired in the year 2010 and since then the GMC is being headed by a Special Officer who is also the District Collector.

The city has 57 divisions — 14 earmarked for unreserved candidates, 16 seats reserved for women, 19 seats reserved for BCs, seven seats reserved for SCs and one seat reserved for ST.

The previous council was headed by the Congress and the last Mayor was Rayapati Mohana Sai Krishna.

While the ruling YSR Congress Party seems to be upbeat about the prospects of a resounding victory, the Opposition TDP is on a defensive wicket as its lone MLA in the city, Maddali Giridhar switched his loyalties to the ruling party. On the day of notification, the TDP suffered a jolt as its MLC Dokka Manikya Vara Prasada Rao joined the YSRCP in the presence of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.

Mayor aspirants in YSRCP

Though the YSRCP has not announced its Mayoral candidate, the toss up could be between Padarthi Ramesh Gandhi and Lella Appireddy, while Kavati Manohar Naidu is also a keen contender. Mr. Ramesh Gandhi, a well-known businessman, has connections with all sections and joined the party during the padayatra of Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy.

Mr. Appireddy is a known loyalist of the party and was in charge of Guntur West Assembly constituency till the year 2018, when the party brought in Chandragiri Yesuratnam, a former DIG of police, to contest in the polls held in April, 2019. But Mr. Yesuratnam lost the polls and was given the chairmanship of the Agricultural Market Committee, Guntur.

Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is unconstitutional and against the basic directive principles of the Indian Constitution. Hence it needs to be repealed and if the government does not budge, people should fight against its implementation, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

Addressing a public meeting organised here on Monday to oppose the CAA, NRC and NPR, he said the government was trying to divide the people of the country in the name of CAA, NRC, Triple Talaq and on communal lines. “Article 14 of the Constitution of India provides for equality before the law or equal protection of the laws within India and the CAA flouts this provision, hence is not a democratic move,” said Mr. Vijayan.

He congratulated Bihar on opposing the CAA and being one of the 12 States that had made a resolution in their respective Legislative Assemblies.

Unemployment

Kerala and Andhra Pradesh have a long history of good cultural relations and that should get strengthened in bringing pressure on the Centre as the ‘democracy is in danger’. The Centre, instead of concentrating on the economy, was more bothered about dividing people on religious lines, he alleged. The unemployment rate was the highest at 45% now, observed Mr. Vijayan.

Communist Party of India national secretary K. Narayana, Communist Party of India (M) State secretary P. Madhu, APCC president Sake Sailajanath, CPI district secretary D. Jagadeesh were present.

64,2020/03/09,TDP leader Dokka joins YSRCP,"He writes to people explaining reasons

Telugu Desam leader Dokka Manikya Vara Prasada Rao met Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and joined the YSR Congress Party on Monday. Minister for Higher Education A. Suresh, MLAs Meruga Nagarjuna and Ambati Rambabu were present.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Vara Prasada Rao in an open letter addressed to the people explained the reasons for taking the decision.

“In my entire political career, I have a single minded intention of serving the people and the political party is just a platform for it. I have my own reasons to quit the TDP. Just days before election notification in 2019, I was asked to contest from Prathipadu when I sought to contest from Tadikonda. I lost by a narrow margin, but the TDP had never sought to address my concerns. Before the beginning of Council sessions, I tendered my resignation sensing that the sessions could become controversial. I believe that the Council has an advisory role and complements the Assembly,” he said.

A Minister in the Kiran Kumar Reddy government, Mr. Vara Prasada Rao won from Tadkikonda (SC) Assembly constituency for two successive terms in the elections held in 2004 and 2009. After bifurcation of the State, he chose not to contest the elections and a year later, joined the Telugu Desam Party and was given the MLC ticket in 2017. He was the Chief Whip in the Legislative Council and won laurels for airing his views on many issues relating to the weaker sections.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/z7g1k9/article31024014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10VJPAGE4DOKKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tdp-leader-dokka-joins-ysrcp/article31024015.ece

70,2020/03/09,Battle royale: female progeny challenge ‘male heir’ rule of MANSAS trust,"Removal of Ashok Gajapathi Raju as chief triggers row between Pusapati families

Vizianagaram, the erstwhile Princely State which has a special place in Indian history, is once again in the limelight due to an ongoing tussle between the families of the late Pusapati Ananda Gajapathi Raju and Pusapati Ashok Gajapathi Raju, former Union Minister, over the control of MANSAS trust which administers a huge extent of prime lands in the North Andhra region. The legal battle between two families might continue for many years, according to legal experts. Around 14,800 acres of land worth more than ₹50,000 crore situated mostly in Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts is technically under the control of the Maharaja Alak Narayana Society of Arts and Science (MANSAS), according to sources. The trust, established in 1958, also controls prime lands of 108 temples, including the Simhachalam Devasthanam and many reputed educational institutions.

The founder of MANSAS, P.V.G. Raju, handled the trust responsibilities between 1958 and 1994 and later his eldest son Ananda Gajapathi Raju headed it between 1994 and 2016. After his death, his brother Ashok Gajapathi Raju served as its chairperson till his removal by the government which appointed Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju, daughter of Ananda Gajapathi Raju, as the chairperson. The government also provided opportunity for other family members, including Ashok Gajapathi’s daughter Aditi Vijayalakshmi Gajapathi Raju, Ananda Gajapathi’s another daughter Urmila Gajapathi Raju and P.V.G. Raju’s daughter R.V. Suneetha Prasad. Pusapati family’s young generation members Arun Kapur and Vijay K. Sondhi also found place in the trust as per the GO MS No.75 issued on March 3 by the Endowments Department which also takes care of the properties along with MANSAS trust.

In normal course, there might not have been any controversy over the properties. However, Ananda Gajapathi’s wife Uma Gajapathi Raju took divorce from him in the year 1991.

Claims over rights

Ms. Sanchaita says she is the legitimate heir in spite of the divorce of her mother. She also questions the ‘male heir’ rule of the trust. Mr. Ashok’s family argues that the trust rules and regulations cannot be ignored since it was the wish of the founder of the trust. Kantubhukta Srinivasa Rao, former president of Vizianagaram Bar Association, said the Indian Trust Act-1982 rules cannot be ignored.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/e9glta/article31018240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VJPAGE4FORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/battle-royale-female-progeny-challenge-male-heir-rule-of-mansas-trust/article31018241.ece
71,2020/03/09,Disha Police Station inaugurated in city,"1,022 appeals for help made via Disha App in State

District Collector A. Md. Imtiaz stressed the need for ensuring a safe environment for women, who were spearheading in all the fields.

Mr. Imtiaz along with the Commissioner of Police Ch. Dwaraka Tirumala Rao, Disha Special Officers Kritika Shukla and Deepika Patil and others inaugurated the district’s second Disha Police Station set up in place of the Police Control Room on M.G. Road in the city on Sunday.

He said women were at the forefront in clinching opportunities in all the sectors setting an example for the rest. He called upon women to use the Disha App whenever necessary to alert police.

Mr. Tirumala Rao said that the State police were considering this year as the ‘Year of Women Safety’ and increased focus on making women feel safe.

He said necessary arrangements would be made by the time Disha Act comes into force.

Ms. Deepika Patil said that so far 18 Disha Police Stations across the State had been inaugurated in a month. The department received 1,022 appeals for help via Disha App and 39 of them led to the registration of FIRs, she said.

In one case, men who noticed a woman in trouble used the app and alerted police and helped her, she said.

Ms. Krithika said that counselling and one-stop centres and other facilities were being established at the Disha Police Stations.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cvyetk/article31018201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VJCITYPAGE2DISHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/disha-police-station-inaugurated-in-city/article31018202.ece
72,2020/03/09,"NRC is anti-national, says Yechury","CPI(M) General Secretary extends support to stir in Tirupati

CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury has said that the CAA/NRC is not merely an anti-Muslim law as being projected, but ‘anti-national’ in nature.

Extending support to the ongoing agitation in Tirupati by the Democratic Secular Protection Front, a conglomerate of Left parties, Muslim and Dalit outfits, in front of the Sub-Collector’s office here on Sunday, he said the agitation was being deliberately escalated to the level of Hindu-Muslim clash, while it actually dealt with misuse of the Constitution.

He said the agitators were against the manner in which citizenship was being linked to one’s faith, which he said was against the spirit of the Constitution. Speaking in Telugu on CAA, Mr. Yechury explained that if the process of according citizenship to all but Muslims was allowed today, the government could wield a similar weapon in future that could lead to marginalisation of Dalits and tribals, which precisely was the concern of Left parties. “Every religion has a holy book, but the Constitution is the holiest book for every Indian. Any form of sacrilege to it will not be allowed,” he vowed.

Taking exception to the government’s reply that the CAA was irreversible as the Bill had been passed in both the houses of Parliament, Mr. Yechury said even the draconian emergency was invoked after being passed in Parliament. “Even if we are branded as ‘anti-national’, we will continue the fight till Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdraws the black law,” he remarked.

‘Stop NPR to stop NRC’

While hailing the Kerala government for passing a resolution in the Assembly not to implement NRC and NPR, which was duly followed by several other States, Mr. Yechury demanded that Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy adopt a similar resolution to prove his sincerity, instead of merely writing to the Centre. He said the NPR should be stopped first so as to bring the NRC to a halt. He not only demanded the delinking of NPR from the census process, but also the continuation of the system followed in 2010, with no additional questions posed to citizens.

The meeting started with chanting of verses from the Quran. CPI(M) State secretary P. Madhu, CITU district secretary K. Murali, CPI State secretariat member P. Harinatha Reddy, district secretary A. Rama Naidu, Republican Party of India president P. Anjaiah, Muslim leaders Shafi Ahmed Qadari (YSRCP) and K.S.

The speakers at various events organised in Tirupati commemorating International Women’s Day on Sunday lavished praise on the fairer sex for their tightrope walk in balancing family and professional lives.

At a meeting organised at TTD’s Annamacharya Kalamandiram, Y.V. Swarnalatha Reddy, wife of trust board Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy, said the world should observe every day as a ‘Women’s Day’, in view of their services. “Women in India enjoyed equal rights in Vedic period before the introduction of patriarchal approach in the latter years by a series of foreign invasions,” she observed.

SPMVV Vice-Chancellor Duvvuru Jamuna saw the need for a bigger fight for women’s empowerment in view of the rise in atrocities against women. Veteran gynaecologist Rama Lakshmi expressed concern over the continuation of female foeticide in the contemporary times, even when the ratio got skewed to 935 girls for every 1000 boys.

Opportunities in IT

The Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT-Sri City) observed the day on the theme ‘Women in Data Science’ and ‘Women Entrepreneurship’. Madalasa Venkataraman, Director (data science) at Oracle called upon the students to make use of opportunities and bag the jobs available in the sector. She also listed out the skill sets and competencies required. Mathangi Sri, data head at Gojek, rated among the top 10 data scientists in the country, explained convergence of data science and AI and machine learning.

Prarthana Bhat, senior data scientist at Progress Bengaluru spoke. Similarly, Silpa Lingareddy, founder of Engage Packaging, traced her entrepreneurship journey, while Sphurthy Parvathaneni, CEO of Sphurthy Eco Systems, spoke on potential schemes and funding opportunities for women innovators.

Collector Bharat N. Gupta joined the celebrations at SVIMS University and called upon the girl students to break the glass ceiling to move up in career. He hailed them for breaching the male bastion, even while fulfilling their duties on the family front. At a programme organised by the Andhra Pradesh Mahila Abhyudaya Samakhya (APMAS) and Sri Padmavathi Women’s University, Fourth Additional District Judge Rama Gopal said discrimination continued due to lack of awareness, in spite of the Constitution providing equal rights and disallowing discrimination in the name of caste, religion and gender.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bigger-fight-for-womens-empowerment-needed-says-v-c/article31018043.ece
74,2020/03/09,Yanamala urges BCs to defeat YSRCP,"‘Jagan failed to keep word on BC reservations’

Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader and former Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu has alleged that Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has tricked the Backward Classes (BCs) by going back on the promise of 59.55% reservation to them in the upcoming local body elections.

In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Ramakrishnudu urged the BCs to work unitedly to defeat the YSR Congress Party in the elections. The BCs trusted Mr. Jagan that he would provide reservations to them, but he ignored their aspirations.

The YSRCP leaders were giving the impression that the government was providing 34% reservations to BCs and BC women. In fact, 34% quota to the BCs was provided by the TDP government.

“The BCs don’t want the mercy of the YSRCP. If BC quota is slashed, opportunities to BC women will also come down,” he said.

Why Mr. Jagan’s followers filed a case against the BCs if he had real concern for the them, he asked. The government did not approach the Supreme Court as it was not interested in rendering justice to the BCs.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/yanamala-urges-bcs-to-defeat-ysrcp/article31017755.ece
75,2020/03/09,"With Telangana govt. fixing MSP, turmeric farmers may get good returns","They need not worry over cap on procurement: official

G. Visweswara Rao, a turmeric farmer of Penamaluru village, is confused after harvesting the crop. Despite bumper yield, the “cap on procurement” worries him. He has reaped 40 quintals per acre while the yield is 20 to 25 quintals for other farmers.

“We have been told that the government will not procure more than 30 quintals from each farmer. I will run into losses if the rule is implemented,” says Mr. Venkateswara Rao.

The officials, however, assert that the farmers need not panic over procurement.

The Central government does not fix MSP for turmeric. So, the State government, in a first such initiative, announced MSP through GO 28 on January 9, 2020.

If the Centre announces MSP or Market Intervention Scheme (MIS), the higher rate will be the procurement price. If the Centre’s price is lower than the State MSP, the difference will be declared as bonus, the officials say.

Special Commissioner & Director of Agriculture and Marketing P.S. Pradyumna says the system has been introduced to avoid exploitation by the middlemen. The objective is to ensure that the farmer enjoys the benefit of MSP.

“The cap is fixed based on the average yield calculated by the Horticulture Department, but that should not be an impediment. The farmers always can revisit the procurement centre the second time,” he says.

Though the government has opened nine procurement centres in the State, the arrivals are yet to reach them. The harvest season has ended and the farmers are now getting ready to cut and process it for sale.

Horticulture Commissioner Chiranjiv Choudhary says that turmeric is cultivated in 29,654 acres across the State, except in Anantapur district. Visakhapatnam stands first with 8,500 hectares and Chittoor is at the bottom with 22 hectares. Srikakulam, Krishna, Guntur and Kadapa are some of the districts where the farmers have taken up turmeric cultivation to a significant extent. The extent of cultivation was 20,835 hectares in 2015-16. The expected yield this year is 3.55 lakh tonnes, he says.

Mr. Venkateswara Rao says that farmers will earn a profit of ₹10,000 to ₹15,000 per quintal only if the entire produce is procured at the procurement centres.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/k93kwa/article31017689.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VJPAGETURMERIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/with-state-fixing-msp-turmeric-farmers-may-get-good-returns/article31017690.ece

The South Central Railway, Vijayawada division, launched ‘Bounce’ bike self-rental services as part of its New Innovative Non-Fare Revenue Idea Scheme by letting space at the east entrance of Vijayawada railway station, on Sunday. Senior divisional commercial manager P. Bhaskar Reddy participated in the inaugural as chief guest and public relations officer Nusrat M. Mandrupkar was the guest of honour.

Vijayawada division took the initiative with the help of Bounce Bike Rentals to provide effective first and last-mile connectivity to rail users to enable them to quickly reach their destinations from Vijayawada railway station. The idea is to make the daily commute stress free, time-saving, reliable, convenient and eco- friendly, according to an official release.

Dockless business model

Bounce bike rentals have chosen the hub-to-hub operating model in the initial phase of its launch to get familiar with city posts and its users before shifting to a dockless business model. The service provider is currently operating 100-plus bounce hubs at potential locations like bus stands, colleges and offices in the city for providing easy last-mile connectivity to its users.

Users can install Bounce app on their mobile phones and can book rides through a two-step procedure, which involves one-time user verification by uploading driving licences and locating the nearest Bounce hubs.

Srinivas complimented the commercial department of Vijayawada division for coming up with innovative ideas and said such initiatives help in bridging the gaps in public transportation system by creating a more affordable and congestion-free ecosystem for daily commuters.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/now-commuting-made-stress-free-for-rail-users/article31017687.ece
77,2020/03/09,Allow only tribals to contest in scheduled areas: E.A.S. Sarma,"‘Some ZPTC and MPTC seats have been reserved for non-tribals’

Social activist and former IAS officer E.A.S. Sarma has criticised reservation of ZPTC and MPTC seats in the scheduled areas for non-tribals.

In a representation to Principal Secretary, Tribal Welfare, R.P. Sisodia, he said some ZPTC and MPTC seats had been reportedly reserved for non-tribals in the scheduled areas of Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts.

“In my view, it is highly imprudent on the part of the State government to reserve any seats in ZPTCs and MPTCs for non-tribals in the scheduled areas of the State.”

He said the Agency Tracts Interest and Land Transfer Act 1917, (Act of 1917), AP Scheduled Area Land Transfer Regulation, 1959 (Regulation 1 of 1959) and AP Scheduled Area Lands Transfer (Amendment) Regulation, 1970, prohibited the transfer of tribal lands to non-tribals.

Unfortunately, as a result of the continuing indifference on the part of the successive governments, the requirements of these laws had rarely been complied with and, as a result, there had been a large-scale infiltration of non-tribals from outside to the scheduled areas, tilting the demographic balance in many villages to the disadvantage of the tribals, he pointed out.

“It is important that this requirement of Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas (PESA) Act, 1996, is enforced strictly and the illegal non-tribal occupiers of the lands in the villages are not allowed to be counted for the purpose of enforcing the requirements of Section 4(g) of the Act,” he stated.

He said “the State government, in my view, if needed, should invoke this provision and amend PESA itself explicitly to provide 100% reservation for the adivasis in ZPTCs and MPTCs.

78,2020/03/09,Govt.’s good work will help YSRCP sweep local body polls: Vijaya Sai,"‘Our nominee should be in Mayor’s seat in prestigious GVMC’

Implementation of most of the promises made in the election manifesto and good governance ushered in during the past 10 months would ensure a clean sweep for the YSRCP in the local body and municipal elections, party Rajya Sabha member and national general secretary V. Vijaya Sai Reddy said on Sunday.

Addressing a gathering of party workers here, Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy asked them to explain people the good work done by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and expose the attempts being made the main Opposition, the TDP, to stall development and deny benefits to the poorer sections of society.

Describing the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) elections as “prestigious,” Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy said the decision to set up the Executive capital in the city made the elections more significant, and asked the party cadres to ensure an impressive show by the party in the 98-ward civic body and elect the party nominee as Mayor on March 23.

“We need to capture the Mayor seat as it is the second important post after the Chief Minister in protocol after the city is made the Executive capital. There will not be any compromise on it,” he made it clear.

Recalling how the party had lost all the four Assembly seats in the city to the TDP in the elections, Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy said they had formed screening committees to select candidates.

Selection criterion

Stating that winning chance would be the prerequisite for the selection of candidates, he said a flash survey would be conducted to find out suitable nominees from those who had not sought ticket.

Claiming that the YSRCP was holding elections by giving lesser time to preventing electoral malpractices, Mr. Reddy said an Ordinance was being issued to prohibit political parties from seeking funds from industrialists.

He alleged that the TDP was trying to approach the election authorities to petition against the ruling party with false claims.

Stating that ticket distribution would be made in a transparent way, he said those not getting it should not get hurt as they would be accommodated in nominated posts.

79,2020/03/09,Lepakshi Vaibhavam ends on a grand note,"Rich cultural heritage of Rayalaseema on display in the two-day festivities

Sri Krishnadevaraya came alive on the large screen on the main dais of Lepakshi Vaibhavam here on Sunday night regaling thousands of tourists, schoolchildren and people from all over the district assembled to taste the variety in cultural heritage of Rayalaseema during the concluding day of the festivities.

It was sheer magic by Kanth Risa, who within seconds generated curiosity among the public with his sand dust art form on a back-lit glass, which was projected onto the large screen on the main dais. Giving a gentle pause and writing in Telugu ‘yevaru’ and giving answer ‘Nuvvu naa… Sri Krishnadevaraya’ and simultaneously creating a near-perfect caricature of the Vijayanagara king, who ruled this region in the 15th Century.

If Surabhi Arts group entertained the audience with their skits and schoolchildren presented some scintillating dance performances in groups, there was not a minute of dull period at the venue and people did not want the festive atmosphere to end enjoying every moment of it to the hilt.

Youth and students from the surrounding villages enthusiastically participated in the rural sporting events on Sunday and archery turned out to be the best attraction with hundreds of them lining up at the venue to cheer the participants, who had come with their bow and arrow. Competition of spinning tops with thread and game of marbles attracted several children to the different venues giving many others a glimpse of some of the forgotten rural sporting events of their childhood.

The proto village and the food stalls were the places visited by maximum number of visitors, who wanted to truly experience the Rayalaseema cuisine and wanted to have a glimpse into the rural day-to-day scenario in the villages. Organising team was aptly felicitated for their deserving hard work put in for over a fortnight for taking the event closer to people’s hearts.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bv8pif/article31017644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VJPAGE3LEPAKSHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/lepakshi-vaibhavam-ends-on-a-grand-note/article31017645.ece

84,2020/03/09,Bhyrappa hopes to see tank in his village filled with Hemavati water,"₹5 crore has been set aside in Budget for development of Santheshivara

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s announcement to earmark ₹5 crore for the development of Santheshivara, the village of well-known Kannada novelist S.L. Bhyrappa in Channarayapatna taluk, has been appreciated by residents of the village and the writer himself. They hope the money will used for rejuvenating the village tank, thus solving their water woes.

When The Hindu contacted the writer, Mr. Bhyrappa said he had requested the Chief Minister for development of the village and to provide a source of water to the tank at Santheshivara. “I am happy he has responded to my request in his Budget,” he said.

Mr. Bhyrappa was born and brought up at Santheshivara, about 26 km from Channarayapatna. The days he spent in the village have recurred in his novels and autobiography Bhitti. The writer has retained his ties with the village though he moved out of the place for studies at an early age.

Not linked to river

“The tank in the village has not been linked to the Hemavati, though it flows closeby. The groundwater table has depleted in the area. Farmers have to drill 700 ft to 800 ft deep to lift water. If the tank is filled with the river water, it will resolve the water problem and at least five villages around Santheshivara will be benefited,” he said.

The writer has converted his ancestral home into a library and a meeting hall, run by Gowramma Trust, named after his mother. The library has a good collection of books contributed by many people across the State. The trust conducts literary events and the hall is open for literary programmes conducted by other organisations as well.

The novelist opined that the village had a school, a bank nearby, and other basic amenities. “Other development works will happen in the due course. My primary concern has been the rejuvenation of the waterbody. I hope the government takes up this work,” he said.

Literary events too

The village residents echoed similar sentiments. Basavaraj, a progressive farmer of Santheshivara, said if the amount was utilised to fill the tank, the farming community would be benefited. “Whenever Mr. Bhyrappa has visited the village, he has expressed disappointment over the water crisis. Now, the Chief Minister has responded. I hope the problem will be resolved,” he said.

He also felt that a portion of the fund could be utilised to conduct literary programmes under the Gowramma Trust in the village.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/m8qtdo/article31026492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGBHYRAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bhyrappa-hopes-to-see-tank-in-his-village-filled-with-hemavati-water/article31026493.ece
85,2020/03/09,Ravi’s comment on ‘time bomb fixed to Constitution’ sparks off a furore,"Minister accused of ‘instigating trouble during the debate’ by making such statements

The remark of Kannada and Culture Minister C.T. Ravi that a “time bomb has been fixed to the Constitution” created a furore in the Legislative Assembly on Monday.

Participating in the special debate on the Constitution, Mr. Ravi said there was anxiety among people about “saving the Constitution”. This triggered sparks, with the Opposition members arguing that as the MLA of a party that was ruling both at the Centre and the State, it was not proper for Mr. Ravi to say that there is a threat to the Constitution from others.

Standing his ground, however, Mr. Ravi said, “Will those who ousted Kashmiri Pandits from Kashmir allow the existence of B.R. Ambedkar’s Constitution?” He said that Kashmir crisis had started as “those opposed to the Constitution became a majority in that State”. If a similar situation arises in other States, how can the Constitution be protected? he asked.

This remark was strongly opposed by the Opposition members. Senior Congress leader K.J. George, who sought to remind Mr. Ravi that the BJP was in power at the Centre, suggested that the BJP government take up rehabilitation of Kashmir Pandits. JD(S) member Shivalinge Gowda accused Mr. Ravi of “instigating trouble during the debate” by making references to “time bomb”.

Mr. Ravi’s earlier remarks on dynastic rule had also led to furore. His question as to whether it is really democratic to have dynastic rule led to several Opposition members launching a counter-attack by referring to BJP leader and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s son himself being elected as an MP. They asked him to clarify if such a practice by his own party leaders was democratic.

On the question of the role of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, he pointed out that the ban clamped on the RSS after the assassination was later withdrawn. Mr. Ravi wondered if it was proper to say that the RSS was behind the murder of Gandhiji in such a scenario.

Remarks on reservation

During the debate on the Constitution, Mr. Ravi said it would not be possible to implement the spirit of the Constitution, drafted by B.R. Ambedkar, if Dalits who are better off did not give up their opportunities in favour of poor Dalits in terms of reservation.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jzr45i/article31026452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGRAVI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ravis-comment-on-time-bomb-fixed-to-constitution-sparks-off-a-furore/article31026453.ece
86,2020/03/09,‘21.19 acres of land will be recovered in 3 months’,"It will be handed over to BWSSB for construction of a water tank, says Revenue Minister

The government will recover 21.19 acres of government land encroached by private parties by registering the property at the sub-registrar’s office at Yelahanka in Bengaluru, in three months, Revenue Minister R. Ashok on Monday informed the Legislative Assembly.

Replying to a question by Krishna Byre Gowda of the Congress on illegal registration of government land at Chokkanahalli in Yelahanka taluk with the support of officials of the sub-registrar’s office, Mr. Ashok said officials had been directed to recover the land and hand it over to the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board for construction of a water tank in that area.

Two parties entered into a sale agreement for ₹29 crore for the land and the buyer had paid the advance amount of ₹3 crore, Mr. Gowda said, and alleged that officials of the taluk too supported the land deal agreement though it was registered as government land in records.

The sub-registrar, who has been transferred, has retained the posting at Yelahanka by challenging the government’s transfer order in the Karnataka Administrative Tribunal, the Minister said.

Mini-Vidhana Soudha

On the members’ demand for a hike in allocation for construction of Mini-Vidhana Soudha in each taluk from the present allocation of ₹10 crore, Mr. Ashok ruled out further increase in the allocation of funds.

‘45 acres recovered’

In the Legislative Council, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Monday said that about 40 to 45 acres of encroached land had been recovered by the committee headed by the former Speaker K.G. Bopaiah. He said that the monthly status on recovery of encroached land would be provided.

Stating that action against the encroacher would be taken irrespective who it was, he said that tens of thousands of acres of government land had been encroached upon, and that recovery of these could be reinvested in infrastructure.

When the Opposition members drew his attention to the A.T. Ramaswamy committee and K.B. Koliwad committee, both of which went into land grabbing cases, Mr. Yediyurappa said that he had the Ramaswamy committee report with him.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/7oyxdz/article31026355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGASHOK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2119-acres-of-land-will-be-recovered-in-3-months/article31026356.ece

Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) was adjudged the best airport by size and region in the category of 2-5 million passengers per year in Asia-Pacific Region at the Airport Service Quality (ASQ) awards.

A release from Airports Authority of India (AAI) said the authority’s continuous thrust on enhanced passenger convenience has been yielding results year after year. Besides Mangaluru, Chandigarh, Thiruvananthapuam, and Lucknow airports of AAI were selected for the awards. In all, they received 10 awards for 2019.

ASQ survey is the world-renowned and internationally established global benchmarking programme measuring passengers’ satisfaction, whilst they travel through an airport conducted by the Airports Council International (ACI). ASQ Awards recognise those airports around the world that deliver the best customer experience in the opinion of their own passengers.

ACI, the global trade representative of the world’s airports carries out international bench marking of airports through its participative program, ASQ Survey, measuring passengers’ satisfaction across 34 key performance indicators that includes eight major categories such as access, check-in, security, airport facilities, food & beverage, retail, airport environment and arrival services.

In 2019, ACI-ASQ survey was conducted at 356 airports across North America, Latin America and Caribbean, Europe, Africa, Middle East, and Asia. The ASQ survey results were monitored by AERA, NITI Aayog and MoCA.

MIA undertook various developmental works during the year to be considered for the award, the release said. The airport commissioned two passenger building bridges; undertook face-lift works of terminal building improving its ambiance; installed large size flight information display systems; introduced app-based cab aggregator; automatic electronic access control systems with e-gates for arrival and departure immigration counters; improved signage in terminal as well as city-side; provided other passenger facilities including ATMs, two concessionaries, 500 new trollies; installation of local art works depicting local culture, heritage and tradition at various places of the terminal and outside and many more.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2vfa00/article31026205.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGMIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mia-gets-best-airport-asq-survey-award/article31026206.ece
88,2020/03/09,CSIR lab working on drug to combat COVID-19,"The Hyderabad-based Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), one of the CSIR labs, has started work on synthesising chemical formulations for the manufacture of drug for COVID-19.

Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Director-General Shekhar C. Mande said in Mysuru on Monday that the Hyderabad-based Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), one of the CSIR labs, has started work on synthesising chemical formulations for the manufacture of drug for COVID-19.

Speaking to reporters after his lecture at the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) here, Dr. Mande, who is also secretary for the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, said the scientists at the CSIR lab have taken up the challenge of developing the molecules towards discovering the drug.

Globally, researchers have shifted their focus on developing the drug and the national laboratories in the country have a collective role towards realising the urgency for the drug. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently reviewed the scientists’ efforts in this direction, he added.

D.r Mande said IICT’s efforts will be to blend the chemicals that are needed in developing the drug.

He said a CSIR lab has obtained licence for developing cannabis-based drugs, particularly painkillers. The Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, had been working on the drug after the Centre approved the research using cannabis (marijuana), growing the plant for medical research.

Earlier, Dr Mande gave a lecture on the topic “In science we trust” where he touched upon contributions of modern science and the ancient India’s contribution to science and technology. “We need to base our hypothesis with strong scientific evidence as the methods of modern science are time tested and trusted.”

Field trials of ‘pest-proof’ cotton variety soon: CSIR

In continuation of CSIR’s ‘farmer-centric’ approaches, a new pest-resistant cotton variety developed by a Lucknow-based research laboratory is ready for field trials which are expected to be done soon at Nagpur in Maharashtra.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, CSIR Director-General Shekhar C. Mande, who was in Mysuru, said the cotton crop usually faces the problem of pest attacks and scientists carried out a research for developing the “pest-proof” cotton variety.

The same variety will undergo further tests and trials before it is certified for commercial cultivation. The research has been carried out in collaboration with the ICAR-Central Institute for Cotton Research.

Dr. Mande recalled the Samba rice variety (Samba Mashuri), which was developed jointly by the Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, a CSIR lab, and the ICAR-Indian Institute of Rice Research. Today, this “pest-resistant” rice variety was grown in about 18 lakh hectares in many States, helping farmers fetch higher yields and higher returns.

Dr. Mande also spoke about the aroma and honey missions. The Khadi Village Industries Corporation (KVIC) has joined hands with CSIR for the “Honey Mission”. Honey is a good alternative to sugar since it contains medicinal properties. A MoU had been signed with KVIC, he said. The idea is to help farmers take up modern methods of beekeeping to improve honey yield and also get additional income.

He said a new programme would be launched by the DST from April 1 to promote basic sciences by setting aside a grant of ₹50 crore. It would help students come up with scientific ideas in an attempt to encourage them to pursue basic science.

On the Aroma Mission and the CSIR Floriculture programme, he said the Aroma and Phyto-Pharmaceutical Mission was intended to boost the cultivation of aromatic plants that have medicinal properties. This mission, taken by the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants and medicinal plants such as lavender and others, will be promoted with the help of farmers in several States, including Karnataka.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/inrewp/article31026184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGMANDE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/csir-lab-working-on-drug-to-combat-covid-19/article31026185.ece

For the first time, the event is being held in India, said U.M. Thirthamallesh, president of Karnataka Growers’ Federation, on Monday.

At a press conference, Mr. Thirthamallesh said the event has been held in London, Brazil, Guatemala, and Ethiopia, and attracts coffee growers from 100 countries. More than one lakh growers will be taking part in the three-day event. India Coffee Trust will be organising the programme in association with Ministry of Commerce and other agencies, he said.

Mr. Thirthamallesh felt the event would be an opportunity for local growers to showcase their coffee. “The theme of the event is ‘sustainability through consumption’. One of the main objectives is to promote the consumption of coffee,” he said.

A study conducted in 2016 showed that the production of coffee would come down drastically in the coming years. In order to prepare the coffee community for the future, the KGF will take up activities to promote multi-cropping with regular income, said Mr. Thirthamallesh. Madhu Bopanna, a trustee of India Coffee Trust, said as part of the event, a convention of local growers would be held on the last day. This would help small growers who form 98% of the total growers in the country.

With this, the zoo very well knows its birds and their health status besides other precautions that are essential,” said zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni. He told The Hindu that no restrictions had been imposed on the visitors following the scare in the wake of cases in Kerala. “We are confident of our measures and accordingly the steps had been initiated. But a general alert is always better despite the best practices in place.”

In fact, the zoo’s closure has had a big impact on the tourism industry since the zoo was one of the key and most popular tourist destinations in the city.

There was resistance from the stakeholders for the zoo management’s decision to shut down the zoo over the bird flu scare but the officials got support from the government since it involved public safety and the safety of animals and birds.

The zoo was shut from January 4, 2017 to February 2, 2017 on the advice of the experts. The NIHSAD had confirmed avian influenza as the cause of the death of some migratory birds in December 2016. Never in the history of Mysuru zoo was it out of bounds for tourists for about a month.

After two consecutive sets of samples of bird droppings tested negative for bird flu, the then Principal Secretary, Animal Husbandry, who reviewed the situation recommended that the zoo can be reopened. The Secretary, Department of Forests, issued an order for its reopening on February 3.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wq8pl0/article31026029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09MYSBIRDFLU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/learning-from-the-past-episode/article31026030.ece

94,2020/03/09,"Now, bird flu scare in Mysuru","Disinfection of vehicles supplying poultry products to Kerala to start from today

After the COVID-19 scare, an alert has been issued in Mysuru district following reports of bird flu cases in Kerala and the authorities of Department of Animal Husbandry here are keeping a close watch on the unusual deaths of birds, including poultry and migratory birds, as a precautionary measure.

In the wake of avian influenza outbreak in the neighbouring State, poultry farms had been kept under close watch besides general surveillance of birds around waterbodies and other places.

‘No need to panic’

“As Mysuru shares its border with Kerala, we have stepped up the surveillance at the check-posts both in the district as well as in Chamarajnagar district. There is no need to panic as there have been no reports of unnatural bird deaths so far,” said Ajit Kumar, Deputy Director, Department of Animal Husbandry, Mysuru.

Dr. Kumar told The Hindu that the Deputy Commissioner, Mysuru, has directed him to take up the measure of spraying disinfectants on poultry cages and vehicles that supply chicken to Kerala. This exercise will begin from Tuesday at the checkpost at Bavali in the district. Similar steps will be taken at the six checkposts in Chamarajanagar district and three checkposts in Kodagu district.

“We don’t get poultry from Kerala but the poultry products are transported from Mysuru to that State. The spraying of disinfectants will continue until the situation becomes normal in Kerala.”

Dr. Kumar said 15 different samples collected from various poultry farms are sent daily to the IAHVB in Bengaluru for tests. This has been the routine since many years to rule out any infection to the birds.

To a question, he said the death of two migratory birds in Hebbal here was not unnatural and there was no need to worry. “However, we are awaiting reports on the cause of death of two cranes reported from Chamundipuram. So far, no samples had been sent to the Bhopal lab from Mysuru.”

He said his staff had been asked to watch out for birds that are sick or carcasses of birds on the lake premises in and around the city.

Meanwhile, the Mysuru zoo is also on alert over the scare. It houses one of the largest collections of birds and has been taking enough safety measures.

Similar measures had also been taken at the Karanji Lake Nature Park which houses the walk-through aviary, according to the zoo authorities.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/35ua8x/article31026003.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09MYSBIRDLEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/now-bird-flu-scare-in-mysuru/article31026004.ece

99,2020/03/09,CSIR lab working on discovering drug to combat COVID-19,"Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Director General Shekhar C. Mande said in Mysuru on Monday that the Hyderabad-based Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), one of the CSIR labs, has started work on synthesising chemical formulations for the manufacture of a drug for the deadly COVID-19.

Speaking to reporters after his lecture at the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) here, Dr. Mande, who is also the Secretary for the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), said the scientists at the CSIR lab have taken up the challenge of developing the molecules towards discovering the drug for the virus. The national laboratories in the country have a collective role in realising the urgency for the drug. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently reviewed the scientists’ efforts in this direction, he added.

In reply to a question, he said the IICT’s efforts will be to blend the chemicals that are needed in developing the drug. “The research has started now, joining the combined efforts the world over for coming up with a potential drug for the disease.”

Dr. Mande said a CSIR lab has obtained licence for developing cannabis-based drugs, particularly painkillers. The Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, had been working on it after the Centre approved the research using cannabis (marijuana), growing the plant for medical research.

Earlier, Dr. Mande gave a lecture on the topic “In science we trust” where he touched upon various perspectives, including the contributions of modern science and ancient India’s contribution to science and technology. “We need to base our hypothesis with strong scientific evidence as the methods of modern science are time tested and trusted.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/csir-lab-working-on-discovering-drug-to-combat-covid-19/article31023234.ece
100,2020/03/09,Existing Karwar Express’ abrupt cancellation by Railway Board affects many,"Many stranded as they had not received intimation; rail activists allege policy violation

Konkan Railway Corporation’s insistence to cancel the existing Bengaluru-Karwar overnight express to introduce a dedicated train to Karwar from Bengaluru put hundreds of passengers who had booked the Bengaluru-Karwar overnight express (16523 via Mysuru) to severe hardship on Sunday night at Bengaluru and Mysuru.

Railway Board had on March 6 cancelled Train Nos 16513/14 (via Kunigal, four days a week) and Train Nos. 16523/24 (via Mysuru, tri-weekly) while introducing Train Nos. 16595/96 Yeshwantpur-Karwar-Yeshwantpur Express bypassing Mangaluru from March 8. While South Western Railway had claimed that all passengers booked on the cancelled trains were given intimation and their bookings were shifted to the new train, the reality was otherwise on Sunday.

The train was to depart at 8.30 p.m. from Bengaluru City on Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays to run via Mysuru while the new train’s departure was at 6.45 p.m. from Yeshwantpur. As such, passengers who reached city station without the cancellation intimation had no option to rush to Yeshwantpur to board the new train.

Ganesh Udupa from Mangaluru, who had a booking to Bantwal, was shocked to learn about the cancellation as he had not received any intimation. While he was able to travel on Train 16517, there were many elderly passengers with heavy luggages at Bengaluru city and Mysuru who had booked destinations beyond Mangaluru, he said. Having no option, all boarded the Bengaluru-Kannur Express (16517) and got down at Mangaluru Central on Monday morning for onward journey. The Karwar express used to be operated as a combined service with Kannur Express till Mangaluru Central where it was bifurcated and operated towards Karwar. Kannur Express now continues to operate as an independent service with enhanced coaches.

Mr. Udupa said the Railway Board’s hurry to cancel an existing train was unheard of and it did not follow its own procedure of hearing the passengers before cancellation.

Passengers who had confirmed bookings on the cancelled train too are at a loss to understand the Railway Board’s logic. Anil Anand, a financial professional from Bengaluru, said he had confirmed booking from Bengaluru to Byndoor in April. “I've now received a message that my booking is cancelled. Neither I can get a confirmed booking on the new train as there is a long wait list,” he said.

Rail activists have fumed at the undue hurry shown by the Board at the insistence of KRCL. “How can Railways assume that the existing trains would lose patronage upon the introduction of the new, dedicated train,” they asked, adding the Railways should have gauged the situation for about six months before cancelling either of the two trains on the basis of poor patronage. The abrupt cancellation violates the Board’s own policy issued in 2005, that the patronage should be less than 30% consistently for a year or the views of affected passengers should he heard or an alternative service was available, pointed out rail activist Anil Hegde from Mangaluru.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/existing-karwar-express-abrupt-cancellation-by-railway-board-affects-many/article31023071.ece

He said his father’s condition is critical.

Deputy Conservator of Forests Girish said the tusker had come from Adarangi forest in Nelamangala taluk of Bengaluru rural district. It had entered Tumakuru district last night and was going back to Adarangi forest when the incident occurred.

102,2020/03/09,Coronavirus | Bengaluru school suspends classes until further notice,"The decision was taken as a parent said that he was in the high risk category for COVID-19, says Principal of The Deens Academy.

Following rumours that a parent of a child was tested positive for COVID 19, the Deens Academy on Monday decided to suspend classes for the all the classes of the school until further notice. The Health and Family Welfare department, however, has denied that a positive case has been reported in the State.

Shanthi Menon, Principal of The Deens Academy said that it was unfortunate that a mail that was meant for internal communication was leaked on social media. “I sent this mail to ask my teachers to be calm and not to over react to the situation. I had received a mail from the parent who said that he was in the high risk category for COVID-19. He and his family will be on quarantine and therefore sent out this mail,” she said. The school was supposed to close for summer vacations on March 31.

Asked why she had stated that a patient was screened positive for coronavirus in her email, she said it was based on rumours spread in the school. “One of an internal mail was misinterpreted and circulated that created unnecessary panic,” Ms. Menon said.

The school has around 1,700 students and 160 teachers.

The school management stated that they have been taking all precautionary measures and the classrooms were washed with disinfectant every day. Besides sending mails to parents advising them not to send their children to school if they had cough, cold or fever, Ms. Menon said that the students were also screened at the school daily.

Confusion regarding holiday

Meanwhile, the Department of Public Instruction late on Sunday night had announced that all pre-primary classes of government, aided and unaided schools would be suspended until further notice.

While some school managements sent messages to parents in the morning stating that it was a holiday, many learnt that the schools were closed only after reaching the school.

Several working parents had to make alternative arrangements for their children. “My child’s day care has also said that they would be closed and I will have to skip work to take care of my child,” said Prajwala S., a parent of a five-year old.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/r5bthf/article30986023.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/coronavirus-bengaluru-school-suspends-classes-until-further-notice/article31022973.ece
103,2020/03/09,Suspected COVID-19 patient leaves Mangaluru hospital against medical advice,"The police has been informed and a surveillance team is at his home

A patient who was brought to isolation ward of the Government Wenlock Hospital on Sunday night, reportedly left the hospital against medical advice the early hours of Monday.

The person hailing from the city had arrived at the Mangaluru International Airport from Dubai on Sunday evening. He was found to be having a fever during the medical screening at the airport.

An ambulance was sent from the city to bring him to the isolation ward of the hospital for tests related to COVID-19. Before the staff could come, the passenger reportedly left the hospital. More details are awaited.

Explained: How is India containing COVID-19?

Meanwhile Health Department officials said that he went against medical advice and police has been informed and surveillance team is at his home. ""He will be brought back and admitted,"" said the official.

So far, six throat swab samples of international passengers arriving in Mangaluru were sent for tests. All of them turned negative for COVID-19.

District health team yet to trace passenger

Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh said efforts are being made to trace the passenger.

Ms. Rupesh told reporters in Mangaluru on Monday that the passenger refused to undergo tests for COVID-19 at the hospital. A team of doctors and nursing staff from the District Disease Surveillance Officer were trying to trace him and convince him to undergo necessary tests, she said.

Following Sunday's incident, District Health and Family Welfare Officer Sikandar Pasha said two teams of doctors and nurses will be involved in screening passengers arriving at the Mangaluru International Airport by international flights.

104,2020/03/09,Scuba diving to get a fillip in Uttara Kannada,"Two more agencies to be permitted to conduct diving; 100 divers to be allowed daily

Scuba diving in the surroundings of Netrani Island, off Murdeshwar in Uttara Kannada, is set to get a fillip with the district administration deciding to soon permit more divers daily, from 60 at present to 100.

In addition to the existing three agencies conducting diving, the administration will also allow two more agencies so as to promote tourism. It will also fix the minimum and maximum user fees to be collected from each of the divers.

Netrani, known for different species of corals and fishes, is 20 km (one way) off Murudeshwar coast. It takes an hour to reach the island in a mechanised boat. Scuba diving is allowed in its vicinity from October to May.

K. Harish Kumar, Deputy Commissioner, Uttara Kannada, said the administration would put in place an app-based system of recording the details of each diver. It will be done by government-appointed staff.

Netrani Island near Murudeshwar in Uttara Kannada.

Mr. Kumar said that each of the five agencies, to be appointed soon, organising scuba diving would have to deposit ₹50 lakh as refundable security deposit with the government. The interest earned from the total deposit of ₹2.5 crore would be used to pay the salary of lifeguards on all the beaches in Uttara Kannada. He said bids have been invited to select the agencies.

The Deputy Commissioner said scuba diving only required interest, courage, and mental preparedness. The agencies conducting the activity have now adopted highest safety measures and are providing diving equipment of international standards. He said that to make it more popular, the administration organised a two-day “scuba festival” in Murdehswar–Netrani recently where the organisers offered concession in user’s fee to the divers. Government and private agencies have joined hands to promote scuba diving in Uttara Kannada.

Vasant Reddy, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Uttara Kannada, said Netrani had 14 species of corals and 89 species of fish.

Ganesh Harikantra, proprietor of Netrani Adventures, registered with the Professional Association of Diving Instructors and one of the agencies authorised by the district administration, said diving is organised at Nursery, Pubble Beach, T 55, Bomb Rock, and Island Back locations surrounding Netrani. Divers are not allowed to touch the fish or damage the corals and throw any materials to sea.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hvpt7y/article31018618.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGSCUBADIVING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/scuba-diving-to-get-a-fillip-in-uttara-kannada/article31018624.ece
105,2020/03/09,Bidar case: Girl who missed exam after police questioning will not miss the year,"Shaheen School management promotes her to next grade without a re-examination

The management of Shaheen School at Bidar, facing sedition charges for the controversial anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) play staged by students on January 21, has decided to promote the girl student, who had missed her final examination of Class VI following police questioning, to the next grade without a re-exam.

She had been accused of delivering dialogues insulting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and her mother had been arrested for allegedly teaching her the dialogues. A traumatised girl, after questioning by the police, had not taken the exam.

Abdul Qadeer, founder of Shaheen Group of Institutions, said there was a provision to promote a student to next class, irrespective of attendance or performance in the final examination.

‘Out of proportion’

“I admit that it was a small mistake that should not have been committed in our school which has maintained a reputation for the last three decades. But the issue should not have been dragged to such an extent that sedition charges are slapped. The developments that unfolded have had a very bad impact on all of us, especially the children who had to face the police questioning. The girl who delivered the controversial dialogue repeatedly faced police interrogation and she missed her final examination. We will admit her to the next class and allow her to continue her studies,” he said. He added the 11-year-old was in a much better frame of mind after her mother, Nazbunnisa, was released on bail last month.

Mr. Qadeer said the child was more confident after knowing that she would be going to the next class.

He alleged that the issue was escalated and sedition case filed as a result of “professional jealousy”. It was part of a larger conspiracy to tarnish the image of him and his institution, he said. He said “national integration” was one of the founding principles of the school which caters to students of all communities.

‘No sedition prima facie’

On March 3, while granting bail to Mr. Qadeer, Principal District and Sessions judge Managoli Premavathi observed that the case did not prima facie make out sedition.

“The extracted portion [of the play] is only offensive part as per the prosecution. But, the dialogue, if read as a whole, nowhere makes out sedition against the government and as such ingredients of Section 124A of IPC are not prima facie made out ... The drama has not caused any disharmony in society. Considering all the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the ingredients of Section 124A of IPC are prima facie lacking,” she said in the order.

Referring to the massive rallies across the country against the CAA and the national Register of Citizens (NRC), the judge said that “everybody has got the right to express disapprobation of the measures of the government with a view to express their alteration by lawful means.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2ijncp/article31018517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGSHASHEEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bidar-case-girl-who-missed-exam-after-police-questioning-will-not-miss-the-year/article31018518.ece
106,2020/03/09,"Upper Krishna Project: Will ₹10,000 crore be enough?","Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s announcement on earmarking ₹10,000 crore for the Upper Krishna Project (UKP) III works has been both welcomed with enthusiasm and viewed with scepticism on the source and adequacy of funding.

While several leaders, including former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and former Water Resources Minister M.B. Patil, have already raised technical points about the post-Budget announcement, the authorities too are in a state of confusion. Experts believe that at least ₹50,000 crore is required to complete the work.

While the first phase was completed in 2005 with the construction of the Lal Bahadur Shastri Reservoir at Almatti, the works taken up under second phase of the project are nearing completion. In the third phase, a lot needs to be done to bring 5.3 lakh hectares of farmland under irrigation. It involves the utilisation of 130 tmcft of water out of the 177 tmcft allocated to Karnataka from Krishna river.

The award by the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT) is yet to be notified by the Centre. However, the State government has already been permitted by the Supreme Court to raise the height of the dam at Almatti from 519.6 m to 524.256 m. Also, a major portion of work on the construction of canals was done when Mr. Patil was Minister, and only a network of smaller canals need to be built after the gazette notification.

Relief and rehab

But the biggest challenge is providing relief and rehabilitation to the residents of over 20 villages that are expected to get submerged when the height of the dam is raised. The government needs to acquire 1,33,867 acres of land, and only 18,039 acres has been acquired so far. The third phase of UKP is estimated to cost around ₹51,148 crore, of which a major portion — ₹30,143 crore — is for land acquisition. The remaining funds are for construction work. Around 33 lift irrigation projects come under UKP, and to operate them some 540 MW of power is required.

Although there have been efforts from Karnataka to get it declared a “national project” and get funding from the Centre, they have not succeeded so far.

Krishna Kolhar Kulkarni, a veteran irrigation activist, said ₹10,000 crore would not be adequate for the project and at least ₹50,000 crore would be required. He said the only way to complete the project within three years was to stop populists schemes that eye vote banks. “This is the only major irrigation project left to be completed in Karnataka. It needs to be prioritised,” he said.

A senior official of the Irrigation Department said the ₹10,000 crore announced was in addition to the ₹9,000 crore already allocated in the Budget to Krishna basin projects. “The allocation of ₹19,000 is perhaps the highest,” he said. However, he said he was unaware of how money would be generated for this work. “That is left to the Finance Department,” he said.

The Upper Krishna Project was started in May 1964 to provide irrigation to districts of north Karnataka, mainly Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Kalaburagi and Raichur.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bojsfk/article31018508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGUKP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/upper-krishna-project-will-10000-crore-be-enough/article31018509.ece

While the Budget was presented on Thursday, the fresh directions not to accept any new applications were sent out on Saturday. Furthermore, it has also asked all its offices to send a detailed list of applications that are pending by Monday.

Mr. Siddaramaiah condemned the government’s move. Speaking to reporters in Davangere, he said that the decision exposed the BJP’s “anti-minority stand”.

Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy also was critical of the government’s move. He said the BJP government had stopped the implementation of not just Shaadi Bhagya, but also several other development initiatives. “Even people affected by floods have not received financial assistance.

The Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has taken the Forest Department to task for its alleged negligence in connection with the death of an eight-year-old girl after she fell into an elephant-proof trench (EPT) on the periphery of Nagarahole National Park.

On October 2, 2019, a holiday on account of Gandhi Jayanti, Sinchana slipped out of her house at Haladakatte tribal settlement to play. While playing on the mound of debris lying alongside the EPT, she lost her balance and slipped into the water-filled trench and drowned.

Compensation paid

Though the Forest Department gave Sinchana’s parents compensation of ₹40,000, the commission, after conducting a spot inspection last month, found fault with the Forest Department for its failure to take necessary precautions after digging the elephant trench, which is more than 10 ft. deep.

Commission’s member for Mysuru circle M.L. Parashuram, who visited the spot, said the department had not erected any retaining wall or signboard near the EPT cautioning people residing nearby about the presence of a deep trench. “This led to the unfortunate death of the girl,” he contended.

In a letter to the Deputy Conservator of Forests and Director of Nagarahole Tiger Reserve D. Mahesh Kumar, dated February 18, 2020, the commission said the EPT was situated adjacent to an anganwadi at Haladakatte settlement and yet there was no signboard or retaining wall. Hence, he sought action against officials responsible for the lapse.

Mr. Parashuram contended that the department had not only ignored the safety of the children, but also violated the rights of people under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006.

Also, he said digging up of the EPT was “unscientific”. For, it prevents rainwater from flowing through its natural course to fill lakes and ponds. Instead, the rainwater gathers in the trenches, leading to such calamities, he said.

Department denies charge

The Forest Department, in reply to the commission, pointed out that the EPT had been dug up near 45 villages and 12 tribal settlements of Hunsur, Periyapatna, and H.D. Kote taluks on the periphery of Nagarhole National Park to minimise man-animal conflict.

The department said the death of the child was “accidental”. The EPT was filled with water owing to rain in the preceding days, the department said, and contended that there was no negligence on the part of officials or personnel of the department.

The department, however, has promised to take up necessary steps to erect solar-powered fencing or rail track fencing during the financial year 2020–21.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ob1xgf/article31018492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGMYSTRENCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/child-rights-commission-takes-forest-department-to-task-over-girls-drowning-in-elephant-proof-trench/article31018493.ece
109,2020/03/09,Kumaraswamy lashes out at B.C. Patil over farm loan waiver,"Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Sunday lashed out at Agriculture Minister B.C. Patil over his remarks on farm loan waiver.

Responding to Mr. Patil’s statement that the former Chief Minister had merely made an announcement on loan waiver and not finalised the modalities for the exercise, Mr. Kumaraswamy said the Agriculture Minister was ignorant about the issue and was making false statements in public. “I did not merely make the announcement on loan waiver when I was in power. I had distributed ₹25,000 crore to farmers for the purpose of loan waiver before demitting the office of Chief Minister. I released the amount when I was in power. Out of that amount, the present government is yet to distribute ₹800 crore,” Mr. Kumaraswamy told reporters in Mysuru.

The former CM also said that his government had asked farmers to furnish only simple documents for claiming loan waiver. “They needed to produce only Aadhaar, ration card and bank account details, as per the guidelines. If the documents were not in order, it was the department’s responsibility to set it right,” he said. He urged the government to ensure that the affected farmers benefit from the loan waiver scheme so that middlemen do not pocket the funds set aside to provide relief to farmers.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hdk-lashes-out-at-bc-patil-over-farm-loan-waiver-comment/article31018478.ece
110,2020/03/09,Deve Gowda promises poll ticket for youth in JD(S),"Former Prime Minister and JD(S) national president H.D. Deve Gowda said on Sunday that his party would give 50% of the tickets to youngsters in all the upcoming elections and would support 33% reservation for women in Parliament and in the State legislatures.

Mr. Gowda said he would hold a protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to draw the Centre’s attention to the issue of women’s reservation. He was speaking at the valedictory ceremony of a two-day workshop of party workers from seven districts here. He added that he was not deterred by defeats and would fight till his last breadth.

Expressing regret about “misinformation” spread against him regarding injustice to north Karnataka, he said ₹18,000 crore was given for the Upper Krishna Project when he was Prime Minister. However, the allegation levelled against him regarding the shifting of South Western Railway headquarters to Bengaluru refuses to die. He also assured to come down to north Karnataka to lead any agitation on people’s issues.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/deve-gowda-promises-poll-ticket-for-youth-in-jds/article31018464.ece
111,2020/03/09,Nikhil Kumaraswamy set to meet Prashant Kishor to strategise for JD(S),"Janata Dal (Secular) youth wing president Nikhil Kumaraswamy, son of former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, is set to meet political strategist Prashanth Kishor this week. Hit by the changing affiliations of youngsters, especially in its Vokkaliga stronghold, the JD(S) plans to seek professional advice.

“Mr. Kishor is currently busy in West Bengal and is unable to come here. Nikhil will be meeting him in the next two or three days for a preliminary meeting, after which senior leaders, including me, will sit down and finalise how to take this forward. This is a top priority for the party now,” Mr. Kumaraswamy told The Hindu.

For several months, the party has been trying to firm up its understanding with I PAC, the organisation run by Mr. Kishor, but it has not been able to move forward because of Mr. Kishor’s participation in the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests.

What is JD(S) seeking

Mr. Kumaraswamy said the party organisation was still strong, but it was also aware that it needed to reach out to the younger generations. As part of the strategy to do so, social media platforms will also be used extensively, the former Chief Minister said.

For the regional party, the shift of the youth to the BJP has been a cause for concern. The shift reflected in the Mandya Lok Sabha election loss and in the recent K.R. Pete bypoll, both of which jolted the party. Increasingly, this shift of youngsters towards the BJP is being discussed and party leaders feel the need for professional advice to attract them to the JD(S), a senior leader acknowledged.

Sources also said that though Mr. Kumaraswamy has been able to attract a large following, it is essentially not converting into votes in elections. “His rallies attract crowds wherever he goes, but inexplicably the same enthusiasm does not show in polls,” a source said, adding that these issues would also be discussed with Mr. Kishor.

Party sources also said that 120 to 130 Assembly constituencies have been identified where the party has consistently been able to get about 20,000 votes. Data from the last four or five elections and how the party performed in these constituencies will be provided to Mr. Kishor.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nikhil-kumaraswamy-set-to-meet-prashant-kishor-to-strategise-for-jds/article31018457.ece

After inaugurating an umbrella organisation that brings together various small organisations set up by north Karnataka people, in Bengaluru on Sunday, he said the government was committed to funding the project considering the increasing number of people visiting Bengaluru from northern districts.

He said the BJP government was committed to working for the cause of north Karnataka which is testified by the allocations made to various irrigation projects in the region such as Mahadayi and Upper Krishna Project.

113,2020/03/09,"Four years on, rewards remain on paper for World Cup player Rajeshwari Gaikwad","Rajeshwari Gaikwad was promised ₹25 lakh and a site

Savita Gaikwad was elated as she watched her daughter Rajeshwari play the Women’s T20 World Cup in Australia, from her small, rented house behind the KSRTC workshop here. But there is a lingering disappointment as the State government and the city corporation have not kept their promises made four years ago when Rajeshwari played the last Women’s World Cup.

The State government had announced ₹25 lakh cash reward to the cricketer for representing India in the World Cup. The city corporation followed suit, and passed a resolution to grant her a site.

“We were so happy. But the reality is till date, the announcements have remained only on paper,” said Vishwanath Gaikwad, younger brother of Rajeshwari.

Expressing dismay over the treatment of international players in Karnataka in comparison to their counterparts in other States such as Haryana or Punjab, he said, “They are also given Class I post in government departments by their governments in recognition to their contributions to cricket. But in Karnataka, we are running from pillar to post to get the money and site,” he said.

Ms. Gaikwad alleged that an official from Bengaluru spoke to her recently and said owing to dearth of funds, the government could offer only ₹5 lakh instead of ₹25 lakh. “We don’t want charity. If the government wants to, they should give the amount they promised,” she said. She, however, thanked the former Water Resources Minister M.B. Patil for giving ₹5 lakh in his personal capacity to Rajeshwari.

Deputy Commissioner Y.S. Patil said he was not aware of the matter, but said he would bring it to the notice of the government. “I will also speak to the city corporation Commissioner to expedite the work of granting the land to the cricketer,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/euz9nm/article31018386.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGRAJESHWARIGAIKWADa,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/four-years-on-rewards-remain-on-paper-for-world-cup-player/article31018387.ece

115,2020/03/09,Mahayogini Matha Manikeshwari passes away at 87,"Several thousands of followers and devotees from various parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra paid homage to Sri Mahayogini Matha Manikeshwari, 87, who passed away at a hillock in Yanagundi village in Sedam taluk of Kalaburgi district on Sunday. “She died of age-related illness on Saturday night. The funeral will be carried out at 3 p.m. on Monday as per Shaiva rituals,” Shivayya Swamy, secretary of Matha Manikeshwari Trust, briefed to media at the mutt.

Sri Matha Manikeshwari was born to Buggappa and Ashamma at Mallabad village in Sedam taluk of Kalaburagi district on July 27, 1934. She left home soon after her marriage with Manikappa of Silarakotriki village in Sedam taluk as she was deeply involved in spiritual life and did not show any interest in married life.

According to sources, after she left home she started practising yoga and dhyana saying her prayers to Sri Mallikarjun Swamy of Srisailam. Then, she began to live in a cave on top of the hillock at Yanagundi some six decades ago. There she practised yoga, dhyana and mounavratam every day, praying to god for peace for humanity. She did not appear in public and used to come out from the cave only during the Mahashivaratri day.

“She intended to visit Srisailam to seek the blessings of Sri Mallikajun Swamy and also wanted to establish one crore Shiva Lingas,” Shivayya Swamy said.

Mathaji has established a total of 108 ashramas across the State and neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. All ashramas are holding spiritual activities creating awareness among people about peace, ahimsa and humanity. They also are running educational institutions providing education to children from poor families.

“Mathaji became popular as a number of visitors came to see her after she opposed animal sacrifices and asked her devotees who came to seek her blessings to follow ahimsa principles as Basaveshwara preached,” Shivayya Swamy added. Her recent public appearance was during the Mahashivaratri celebrations in February.

Nearly a lakh people paid homage to the departed soul. More are expected on Monday. She will be taken inside the cave and buried under the Shivalinga which herself established. “We will fulfil her wish and carry out the funeral as per Shaiva rituals,” Shivayya Swamy said.

The police have made elaborate security arrangements by putting up barricades. Nearly a lakh people, who formed long queues, took the last darshan of Mathaji. Most of the women devotees could not control their emotions and broke down when they saw the body of Mathaji.

116,2020/03/09,"Centre, State government will work to set up industrial corridor, says Angadi","‘It will be between Belagavi and Dharwad to ensure development of NK’

“The Union and the State governments will work together to set up an industrial corridor between Belagavi and Dharwad, to ensure the development of north Karnataka,” Suresh Angadi, Union Minister of State for Railways, said here on Sunday.

He was speaking after the swearing-in of the new office-bearers of the BJP at the block level. “Work on the corridor will start alongside the work on laying a direct railway line between Belagavi and Dharwad via Kittur,” the Minister said.

According to him, the Railway Ministry was taking up the project of the construction of the line on priority.

“The State government has responded to our request and announced that the land for the project will be given without cost and that it will share half the cost of the project. We are thankful to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa for this,” he said.

“The State government will also work towards reviving the industrial area project in Kittur in line with the spirit of the Make in India scheme. We will invite national and multinational companies involved in the manufacturing of railway spares and defence equipment. We have urged the State government to study the proposal and come up with a plan for the area,” he said.

He said he would not support the demand for an international airport in Belagavi as there was neither the land nor infrastructure for the project. He was responding to a query about a social media campaign to upgrade the Sambra airport in Belagavi to an international airport.

“We have acquired land for roads, and for setting up of VTU and Rani Channamma University, and other similar projects. If we want to acquire more land now, the people will be angry with us. Hubballi has an extended airport and other facilities to have an international airport. That is why when MPs from north Karnataka met the Prime Minsiter seeking an international airport in this region, I seconded the choice of Hubballi,” Mr Angadi said.

“Earlier, I suggested that a new international airport be built between Hubballi and Belagavi. But leaders like Manohar Parrikar and other leaders from Maharashtra did not support it as they wanted it for their State,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sdejoa/article31017605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9BGANGADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/centre-state-government-will-work-to-set-up-industrial-corridor-says-angadi/article31017606.ece
117,2020/03/09,"Hansraj Bhardwaj, former Governor, passes away","He served in the post between 2009 and 2014

Hansraj Bhardwaj, 82, former Governor of Karnataka and Union Law Minister, passed away in Delhi on Sunday. He was ailing for the past few days and breathed his last in a private hospital.

One of the longest serving Law Ministers of the country, Mr. Bhardwaj was Karnataka Governor between 2009 and 2014. A Congressman, he was among the long-term loyalists of the Nehru-Gandhi family.

The tenure of Mr. Bhardwaj as Governor here was stormy that saw confrontation with the then BJP government headed by B.S. Yediyurappa. The fact that Mr. Bhardwaj had recommended President’s rule twice when Mr. Yediyurappa was the Chief Minister had not gone down well with the BJP, which petitioned the then President Pratibha Patil to recall him. Mr. Yediyurappa was asked to prove majority twice in the legislature in a span of three days.

While he particularly hit out at Mr. Yediyurappa’s government for its alleged failure to curb illegal mining and attack on churches, the petition by Mr. Yediyurappa termed him as “behaving like an Opposition leader”.

He also referred a complaint to the Election Commission seeking disqualification of the Reddy brothers of Ballari from the Assembly for alleged conflict of interest. Later, he also accorded sanction for prosecution against Mr. Yediyurappa by the Karnataka Lokayukta under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, for his alleged involvement in illegal mining. The High Court later intervened to provide relief to Mr. Yediyurappa.

The BJP government and Mr. Bhardwaj were at loggerheads not only over the appointment of the Lokayukta after he rejected the candidature of the former Chief Justice of Kerala High Court S.R. Bannurmath, but was also accused of withholding important Bills passed by both Houses of legislature. He had also created a controversy by withholding permission to accord honorary doctorate to writer late M. Chidananda Murthy.

Several leaders, including Mr. Yediyurappa and the former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, condoled the death of Mr. Bhardwaj.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/h44qfg/article31017595.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGBHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hansraj-bhardwaj-former-governor-passes-away/article31017596.ece
118,2020/03/09,GTD: Will be in JD(S) for remainder of Assembly term,"The former Minister G.T. Deve Gowda, who has been criticising the JD(S) leadership over the last couple of months, has made it clear that he will continue in the party for the remaining three years of his Assembly term.

Mr. Gowda, MLA from Chamundeshwari Assembly constituency in Mysuru, said he won on a JD (S) ticket and will remain in the party.

Speaking to reporters in Mysuru on Sunday, Mr. Gowda said politicians switch parties for the sake of opportunities.

“Political parties too are not guided by principles or ideology,” he said, and added that present day politics was only about power.

Softening his stance against the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, Mr. Gowda said that he can occupy the CM’s post two more times if he has divine blessings.

Downplaying the reported differences between him and the JD(S) leadership, Mr. Gowda said his relationship with Mr. Kumaraswamy had not changed.

When his attention was drawn to the criticism to the State Budget even from the ruling BJP MLAs, Mr Gowda said the finances were in a bad shape.

The financial condition has been further hit on account of the decline in Central funds, he said.

“Even I had sought ₹100 crore for the Peripheral Ring Road for Mysuru, but the amount has not been sanctioned. Even Umesh Katti (BJP MLA from Belagavi) has complained about injustice to his region.

119,2020/03/09,Plans afoot to promote Chamarajanagar as textile hub,"In a move that could give an impetus to the industrial development of Chamarajanagar, there are plans to promote the district as a textile and garment hub as it is close to cotton cultivating areas and to create jobs in the district hinterland.

One of the leading players in technical textiles has already evinced interest in establishing a unit at the industrial area at Badanakuppe –Kellamballi at a cost of ₹900 crore.

Though discussions are in the preliminary stages, Chamarajanagar Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi told The Hindu that the private enterprise was serious about setting up the unit to manufacture technical textiles that has industrial applications.

Only last month the Union government approved the constitution of a National Technical Textile Mission to promote the variety that is reckoned to be a sun-rise sector with the global market value pegged at around ₹17.75 lakh crore of which India’s share is estimated to be around ₹1.14 lakh crore.

“The private enterprise was awaiting the launch of the new textile policy and now that it has been rolled out we intend to take forward the discussions on the launch of the project,” said Mr. Ravi.

This is in tune with the current efforts to promote and develop Chamarajanagar as the knitwear hub of Karnataka.

“Our focus is textiles as it is not only labour intensive but also needs semi-skilled or unskilled workers who could be trained. Given the vast manpower in Chamarajanagar, the textile units could help generate jobs, especially for women,” Mr. Ravi added.

Agriculture is the main occupation in the district which was identified as among the most backward regions in the Nanjundappa Committee Report on Regional Imbalances.

Besides, more than 60% of the district is under forest cover and agriculture is the main occupation of the people. While cotton is one of the major crops in Chamarajanagar, its proximity to other cotton-growing areas, like H.D. Kote in Mysuru , besides connectivity to Tamil Nadu, which is a major textile and industrial manufacturing hub, are the reasons for promoting textile industries, according to the district administration.

Also, the industrial areas in Kadakola and Nanjangud in the neighbouring district of Mysuru, is saturated. Feedback from the local industrialists in Mysuru indicated that they were serious about entering Chamarajanagar.

“We have nearly 1,400 acres of well-developed industrial park in the district which has been provided with roads, power connectivity, water etc. It is also about 20 km from Nanjangud industrial area and hence ideally situated,” according to the Chamarajanagar Deputy Commissioner.

The industrial area was inaugurated 3 years ago and has granite units as well but the focus on textile is expected to create jobs on a large scale.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/3ctqfq/article31017561.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9BG-TEXTILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/plans-afoot-to-promote-chamarajanagar-as-textile-hub/article31017562.ece

The package was prepared under the aegis of the Kerala State Planning Board. Dr. Isaac said the second Kuttanad package would be implemented considering the experiences learnt from the 2018 deluge. The eco-restoration of the Vembanad wetland ecosystem, farming, development and flood mitigation will be given priority.

As part of it, steps will be taken to get Vembanad Lake rid of plastic waste with the help of fisherfolk. The absorption capacity of the backwaters will be enhanced by mechanised lifting of muddy sludge from the backwater swamp.

Apart from restoring the wetland system, measures will be taken for flood mitigation in Kuttanad by constructing outer bunds and removal of sediments.

The new terminal will give impetus to the tourism sector,” Dr. Isaac said.

The boat terminal is one of the major components of the multi-crore Alappuzha mobility hub project.

The other components include the development of the KSRTC bus terminal along with construction of a multi-level car parking and commercial space, repairing facilities for the Irrigation department and State Water Transport Department (SWTD), a bridge over Vada canal, and so on.

The Minister said the State government was ensuring the development of the eastern parts of the district including Kuttanad by constructing new bridges, buildings, and roads through KIIFB.

The old and historically important buildings in the western side of the district would be conserved under the heritage project, he said.

126,2020/03/09,Epic characters come alive as humans,"Mullakkara Retnakaran’s ‘Mahabharathathiloode’ is a compilation of discourses

Time has come to introspect and pose queries to ourselves on “who we are and not just who I am,” says Legislator and Communist Party of India leader Mullakkara Retnakaran, who has brought out ‘Mahabharathathiloode,’ a compilation of his discourses on the epic.

Such probing questions assume significance when legions of fellow countrymen are facing the threat of being stripped of their citizenship and nationhood and resistance is precipitating across the country.

Lecture series

When the Soorya Dance and Music Society invited Mr. Retnakaran to deliver a lecture series on on Mahabharatha, he critically evaluated all characters and resolved not to approach them with awe but discover their human traits.

The stories rendered by his grandmother Gourikutty gushed through his mind, but apparently without the delusions of grandeur on which they were moulded. He would go on to delineate their inherent strengths and frailties. After an initial resistance, his audience accepted it with interesting queries.

“The strife for wresting power and the insatiable greed for wealth, lust for women, and authority will recur eternally, only the settings and trappings change. We can still see Karna, Bhima, and Gandhari among us. But for their demeanour, the inner-self is all the same and hence the epic could be defined as a mirror held to the society for all ages,” he says.

The best instance in this regard is Karna, who is often depicted as an epitome of supreme sacrifice. In an age when progeny politics thrives, Mr. Retnakaran reminds how wards could, at the same time, be a bane and blessing for some.

“A mother relishes only her child’s first cry. That moment when ecstasy complements pain and marks the birth of a child,” he says and poignantly narrates in the book the woes Kunthi, who is forced to discard her child, had to bear and the pangs of shame and mental trauma that haunts Karna all through his life.

Mr. Retnakaran blames the upper strata of society for creating such characters again and again and one could come across them easily even now.

His publisher friend Asramam Bhasi evinced interest to compile and publish the lectures and now is open for more critical evaluation.

“I strongly hold the view that the Left and the progressive should lay due accent on our equanimity and secular nature, which is attributed to the concept of God, so that He will not be appropriated by vested interests to create caste and communal divisions among us,” he says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/epic-characters-come-alive-as-humans/article31026435.ece

129,2020/03/09,Officials bid to quell fears,"Three linked with cases of Pathanamthitta yet to test positive

A day after five persons in Pathanamthitta district tested positive for COVID-19, the Health officials in Kottayam are on their toes trying to address the concerns raised by the public.

Officials with the District Medical Office here on Monday urged the public not to be panicky as no one from the district had tested positive for the disease till Monday. “The three persons who had spent more than four hours with the COVID-19-infected family in a car, are yet to test positive for the disease. They are under close observation and until tested positive, they pose no threat to others who came into contact with them,” said Jacob Varghese, District Medical Officer, Kottayam.

Meanwhile, the authorities have shifted the elderly parents of the virus-infected family in Pathanamthitta to the Government Medical College, Kottayam. With this, the number of persons in the special isolation ward here has become seven. Officials are now awaiting the test results of swab samples collected from the patients for further action. One person is in isolation in the district general hospital and another in a private hospital.

One person who was in isolation at a private hospital has tested negative for the disease. As of now, 91 persons have been put under home quarantine as part of the preventive action. Officials are verifying a report by the Directorate of Health Service (DHS) that just over 20 persons from the district had been on board the Qatar Airways flight in which the COVID-19-affected family landed here from Doha on February 29. If found true, this points to the fact that more passengers had left the airport without subjecting themselves to medical screening,” said a senior official. Two persons aboard the flight are under home quarantine.

High price of masks

A team led by Additional District Magistrate Anil Oommen on Monday launched a drive against shops and medical stores selling masks and hand sanitisers at exorbitant prices. The district has been witnessing a panic sale of the products ever since the confirmation of five COVID-19 cases in Pathanamthitta.

130,2020/03/09,Two more suspected KFD cases in Wayanad,"Four confirmed cases reported in the district in a week

Two more patients were admitted to the District Hospital at Mananthavadi with the symptoms of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD or Monkey Fever) on Monday.

As many as four confirmed KFD cases were reported in the district in a week and a woman died of the disease on Sunday.

The samples collected from the patients were sent to the Manipal Centre for Virus Research for further analysis, District surveillance officer Noona Marja said.

Surveillance had been stepped up in the hotspot areas identified by the Health Department, Dr. Noona Marja said.

Reluctance

Close to 300 doses of vaccines had been stocked and a further 1,000 doses had been ordered.

But the reluctance of villagers to take the vaccination was a major challenge, Dr. Noona said.

Meanwhile, Wayanad Collector Adeela Abdulla had convened a meeting of senior officials of the Health, Forest and Animal Husbandry Departments on Monday to assess the situation.

The meet was convened in the wake of a KFD death reported in a tribal hamlet at Kattikulam under the Appappara Family Health Centre on Sunday.

“Directions have been given to the Health, Forest and Animal Husbandry Departments to intensify preventive measures, including a door-to-door vaccination drive in Thirunelly grama panchayat to combat KFD,” Ms. Abdulla told The Hindu.

Ms. Abdulla also directed to give special care to the patients admitted at the District Hospital, Mananthavadi with the symptoms of fever.

When Ms. Abdulla had visited the hamlet, the residents complained that earlier the disease had transmitted only to those who frequently visiting the forest but, now it was transmitted from monkeys which were straying in human habitats.

Hence steps should be adopted to cull the stray monkeys, they said.

Ms. Abdulla directed the Forest and Wildlife officials to chalk out a project to curb monkey menace in the area.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/two-more-suspected-kfd-cases-in-wayanad/article31026416.ece

132,2020/03/09,BS-IV vehicles have to be registered by March 31,"Motorists, financiers and auto dealers in a fix

The decision not to register all class of motor vehicles with Bharat Stage IV (BS-IV) emission norms after March 31 and to sell BS-IV vehicles in the inventory as scrap post that date have put the motorists, automobile dealers, and the financiers in a fix.

Even if vehicles with BS-IV emission norms are purchased before March 31, such vehicles cannot be registered from April 1, as the Supreme Court has ordered that no new motor vehicles with BS-IV emission norms can be sold after March 31.

Those who had booked the vehicles with BS-IV emission norms and were planning to take delivery on auspicious days in April, those who have taken delivery and booked fancy numbers, and others who have given chassis for body-building will have to take permanent registration by March 31.

Onus on buyers

“The onus of registering new BS-IV vehicles before the deadline is on the buyer. Any failure to register BS-IV vehicles before March 31 will make it a scrap. Those planning to buy BS-IV vehicles should do it before the deadline,” a top Motor Vehicle Departement official told The Hindu.

Those in search of a new vehicle has been advised to be cautious, as automobile dealers will come up with tempting offers to clear the inventory of vehicles with BS-IV emission norms. The impression among the buyers that the emission norms are only for cars, as the relevant marking is generally seen on cars, is not correct.

It is applicable for motorcycles also and the emission specifications will be given in Form 22 and invoice of the vehicle.

In view of the malpractices during the change over from BS-III to IV, the authorities are also on guard to ensure that unsold BS-IV vehicles are taken and dates tampered with to get it registered.

Sreelekha, asked the Regional Transport Officers (RTO) to convene a meeting of automobile dealers under its jurisdiction before March 10 to inform them to comply with the orders of the Supreme Court.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bs-iv-vehicles-have-to-be-registered-by-march-31/article31026409.ece
133,2020/03/09,"SSLC, HSE examinations from today","COVID-19 threat: asymptomatic students in quarantine will be allowed to appear

The Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) and Higher Secondary Education (HSE) examinations will be held as scheduled from Tuesday despite a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the State.

Minister for Health K.K. Shylaja said at a press meet here on Monday that after discussions with the Minister for General Education and the General Education Secretary it had been decided that asymptomatic students in quarantine would be allowed to appear for the examinations in an isolated room.

Precautionary steps

Director of General Education (DGE) K. Jeevan Babu said there was no confirmation of any student appearing for the examinations having COVID-19.

However, the department had put in place precautionary measures in case any student did have COVID-19 or belonged to an infected family and was in isolation or quarantine.

In such cases, the department would look into each case individually and if needed, make arrangements for the student to appear for the Save A Year (SAY) examinations, Mr. Jeevan Babu said.

Asked about facilities being put in place to screen students at exam centres, he said it would be very difficult to make arrangements to screen hundreds of students. Moreover, advisory from the Health Department was in place in the regions from where COVID-19 cases had been reported, and these were available to schools too.

These are the first annual examinations to be held since the integration of the high school, higher secondary, and vocational higher secondary sections under the umbrella of the Directorate of General Education.

Morning exams

It is the first time in history that the examinations for all three are being held at the same time — in the morning.

While the SSLC and HSE examinations will go on till March 26, the vocational higher secondary examinations will continue till March 27.

134,2020/03/09,Court verdict on Jolly’s bail plea on Thursday,"It will hear clarifications on Wednesday

The Kozhikode district sessions court will deliver the verdict in two bail applications moved by Koodathayi serial killings prime accused Jolly Joseph on Thursday.

However, C. Suresh Kumar, First Additional District Judge, who is holding charge of the District and Sessions Court, will hear clarifications from the prosecution on Wednesday based on the arguments that ended last week, special prosecutor N.K. Unnikrishnan said.

Six cases

The Koodathayi killings pertains to six cases in which Jolly Joseph allegedly eliminated members of two branches of the Ponnamattom ancestral family after giving them poison or cyanide-laced food or drink over a period of 14 years.

Mr. Unnkrishnan had argued that granting bail to Jolly, arraigned as an accused in the cases of poisoning to death six persons, would sent a wrong message to society. Besides, it would also be a threat to her life. Already she had tried to end her life while in jail.

The Kasaba police had already registered a case in connection with the suicide attempt. Further, most of the witnesses in the cases relating to killing of Sily, wife of Shaju Zacharias, her second husband, and Sily’s two-year-old daughter Alphine were her relatives.

So Jolly could influence these witnesses if she was out on bail, Mr. Unnikrishnan said.

However, defence lawyer B.A. Aloor, who is representing the prime accused, had argued that there was no need to remand Jolly in prison as the police had filed the chargesheet in all the cases. The police and the jail authorities had cooked up the suicide attempt case, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/court-verdict-on-jollys-bail-plea-on-thursday/article31026389.ece

A challenge can also be an opportunity is how the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) views the current cycle of COVID-19 infections in Kerala.

The government nodal agency for entrepreneurship and incubation activities has launched two robots developed by startup firm Asimov Robotics to spread awareness about arresting the spread of the virus. One of the robots also distributes face masks, sanitizers and napkins for better cough hygiene.

At the KSUM’s Integrated Startup Complex at Kalamassery, the other robot screens detail about the World Health Organisation’s campaign to contain the pandemic.

The Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) may come up with specific health instructions for its faithful and the bishops to follow in the wake of fresh cases of COVID-19 infection being reported.

The KCBC had earlier issued a circular on March 3 alerting the faithful to follow the government instructions for preventing the spread of disease.

Later, it had circulated a letter by Cardinal Oswald Gracias, the president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India, on March 6, listing out the steps to be followed.

In his letter to the parish priests, priests-in-charge and head of institutions in the Archdioceses of Bombay, the Cardinal had asked them to dissuade people from kissing the Cross and to say namaste with folded hands instead of handshakes as a precautionary measure against the spread of the pathogen.

Cardinal Oswald had also suggested the priests and the Ministers to purify their hands in a bowl of water or with a sanitizer before the distribution of the Holy Communion.

Cardinal Oswald had also directed them to keep the Holy water stoops dry and to temporarily suspend the meetings of cells, sodalities and associations if infections are reported in the community.

138,2020/03/09,Police flag social media misinformation campaign,"Deceptive posts posit alcohol, magic cures as remedies

With coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) threatening to rear its head in Kerala again, the police have flagged the increasing misuse of social media to spread misinformation about the pandemic.

They have stumbled upon several deceptive posts, including few that actively promote the use of alcohol as a prophylactic for the virus outbreak. They have booked four persons for disseminating fake news about the infection. The misinformation campaign that has also hit Kerala seems to be in lockstep with the relentless march of the virus across the globe. The State, with its sizeable diaspora and a high degree of smartphone and social media penetration, offers an unusually large target for fake news in the time of the public health crisis.

Social networking services that offer video-sharing appears to be the preferred vehicle for spreading fake news about the outbreak.

Mischief-mongers have used them to promote magic cures, quack treatments, and non-clinical remedies to combat the viral infection.

‘Naturopathy experts’

The police are focussed on the online activities of a few self-styled evangelists for naturopathy. They had used their social media heft to instigate people to shun medical care during the Nipah outbreak in 2019.

One of them recently questioned the need to quarantine COVID-19 patients, disparaged the State’s efforts to contain the illness, and offered to treat stricken persons without donning protective gear. Some have created fake social media accounts to debunk empirical evidence about the spread of the virus and offered alarmist propaganda that focussed on conspiracy theories instead.

The police are also monitoring social media for attempts to ostracise patients and stigmatise caregivers.

State Police Chief Loknath Behera on Monday warned that the law enforcement would prosecute those who spread misinformation about the outbreak.

139,2020/03/09,High alert in Pathanamthitta,"Contact-tracing on, all biometric services stopped in district

The Pathanamthitta district administration continues to be in a state of high alert in the wake of the five confirmed COVID-19 cases.

District Collector P.B. Noohu told The Hindu that the situation was under control. An intensive drive was on to identify all those who had come in contact with the five infected persons from Aythala in Ranni since February 29 till they were taken to the isolation ward at the Pathanamthitta General Hospital on March 6.

Isolation wards were opened at the General Hospital and the District Hospital at Kozhencherry. Another 15 rooms would be attached to the isolation ward at the General Hospital as a precautionary measure, Mr. Noohu said.

A total of 18 people, including the five confirmed cases, were admitted to the isolation wards set up at four government hospitals in the district.

Of this, 12 were at the Pathanamthitta General Hospital, four at the District Hospital, Kozhencherry, and two at the Adoor General Hospital.

One missing

One person from Vechoochira in Ranni who was admitted to the isolation ward at Pathanamthitta General Hospital is reported missing from Monday evening. The Collector said a search is under way to find him.

A total of 733 persons were quarantined at their homes in the district on Monday. The administration was planning to open two more isolation wards in the district, at Ayyappa Hospital at Ranni and at Archana Hospital at Pandalam.

Two elderly persons, parents of the infected brothers from Aythala, were shifted to the Government Medical College Hospital, Kottayam, on Monday.

National Health Mission district coordinator Aby Sushan said 270 direct contacts of the infected persons and 449 secondary contacts had been identified so far. Of the 270 primary contacts, 95 were classified as high risk category, sources said.

They were quarantined at their homes and their health status was being monitored.

The administration has sought public cooperation and asked people and organisations to postpone public and private functions, meetings, and religious ceremonies to keep a check on the infection.

Mr. Noohu said the delay on the part of the three patients who came from Italy in seeking medical treatment and reporting the matter to the authorities concerned led to the present situation. District Medical Officer A.L. Sheeja urged the people to follow the directives issued by the Health Department to check the infection from spreading to more people.

Shortage of masks

Mr. Noohu said steps had been taken to address the shortage of masks in the district, in the wake of complaints from the public.

COVID-19 was confirmed on Monday in a three-year-old admitted to the isolation ward in the Government Medical College, Ernakulam, on March 7.

The child, from Kannur, was running a fever on arrival from Dubai and was brought to the medical college along with the parents.

The child is stable and there is no cause for worry, according to hospital sources.

Body fluid samples of parents have been given for testing for which results are awaited. As many as 140 more people have been put under quarantine in the district on Monday.

Of these, 99 people were those who had travelled in the same flight, EK 530, as the child on March 7.

Eleven more people have been brought under the isolation ward of the medical college on Monday, taking the number in the isolation ward to 17.

In the district, a total of 281 people are under home quarantine.

Twenty-five body fluid samples from the medical college were sent for testing to National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha.

A review meeting was held by the District Collector S. Suhas in the wake of a positive case in the district.

However, he said that there is no scope for any worry as the situation is under control. It was advised that those having common cold symptoms of cough, fever and upper respiratory problems should stay away from public spaces. But only those who had travelled to countries abroad where COVID-19 had been reported need to get themselves tested for the disease. Those under home quarantine should strictly follow the instructions of the Health authorities.

141,2020/03/09,COVID-19 scare: police turn back foreign tourists from Attukal Pongala locality,"The Kerala government has instructed hoteliers to counsel foreigners against visiting congested places, given the global outbreak

In a bid to forestall further COVID-19 infections, the Kerala police on Monday turned back some foreign tourists from the Attukal Pongala festival area.

Thousands of women have assembled within a six-km square radius of the famed temple to participate in the festival. Many have been sleeping rough since Sunday to secure an open ground to offer the sacrament, a mix of rice and jaggery cooked on open hearths.

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran told newspersons that the tourists were holidaying at Kovalam and the spectacle had attracted them. The government had instructed hoteliers to counsel foreigners against visiting congested places, given the global outbreak.

The government has sent back law enforcers, including women officers, who it had requisitioned from Pathanamthitta to help police the festival.

143,2020/03/09,Coronavirus: Kerala’s Aythala presses the panic button,"3 churches stop Sunday mass, public frantically search for masks

Panic struck the small village of Aythala in Ranni on Sunday, with the Health authorities confirming COVID-19 infection in five persons who were admitted to the isolation ward at the General Hospital two days ago.

Television news channels started scrolling an announcement of District Medical Officer A.L. Sheeja, confirming COVID-19 infection in three persons who had recently reached their home in Aythala and two of their relatives in the neighbourhood.

The three churches in the village stopped the Sunday mass and asked the faithful to stay at their homes for the time being. Roads in the nearby town of Ranni too were more or less deserted.

Shops closed

Almost all shops in the town remained closed and people began a frantic search for masks. Various voluntary organisations later distributed masks for free.

Local MLA Raju Abraham and health workers rushed to the area and sought people’s cooperation in keeping the infection at bay.

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja consulted Mr. Abraham to chalk out plans to identify all those in and around Aythala who had come in contact with the five infected persons. Teams of people’s representatives and Health officials visited almost all houses in Aythala twice on Sunday, prompting the public to undergo medical examination as directed by the department.

Drivers identified

The teams have also identified the autorickshaws and other vehicles in which the infected persons had travelled from February 29 to March 7 and asked the vehicle drivers to undergo clinical examination.

144,2020/03/09,Five new COVID-19 cases in State; total in India now 39,"Three-member family from Pathanamthitta did not report travel to Italy, evaded airport scanners

Five persons, including two women from Pathanamthitta in Kerala, tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, taking the total number of confirmed cases across the country to 39.

Kerala Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said the State had been put on high alert in the wake of the new cases. The Minister added that all the passengers who travelled with the infected family on the Venice-Doha Qatar airlines QR 126 flight on February 28 and the Qatar Airlines flight QR514 from Doha to Kochi on February 29 should get in touch with health authorities.

Official sources said three of the infected persons — a couple in their 50s and their 24-year-old son — had reached the Kochi international airport from Venice via Doha. All three, who were reportedly having mild fever, failed to inform the airport authorities or the Health Department officials that they were coming from COVID-affected Italy.

Relatives infected

They were received at the airport by a few relatives from Kottayam, and reached their village of Aythala in Ranni the same day.

A brother and sister-in-law of the man who had visited Italy were the first to seek treatment for fever at a private hospital in Ranni on Friday. The doctors found symptoms of COVID-19 and learnt that three of their relatives had recently returned from Italy. The matter was immediately referred to the District Collector and the district Health authorities.

The two patients and their three relatives were shifted to the isolation ward at the Pathanamthitta General Hospital. Laboratory reports released early on Sunday confirmed that all five had COVID-19 infection.

The Collector convened an emergency meeting of health officials at 2.30 a.m.

An action plan was prepared to identify all those who had come in contact with the infected persons. According to officials, the family had reportedly visited a relative’s house in Punalur and the office of the District Police Authority, besides attending a few functions since their return.

The Collector has constituted eight teams, comprising seven members each, including two doctors, to examine the health status of those who came in contact with the five infected persons.

Condition stable

Meanwhile, the 86-year-old mother and 90-year-old father of the infected brothers too were shifted to the isolation ward with fever on Sunday.

According to District Medical Officer A.L. Sheeja and General Hospital Medical Superintendent Ashish Manohar, the condition of all the five infected persons is stable.

The authorities here are preparing the list of those who have interacted with the infected persons to ensure their quarantine for 28 days as part of the disease prevention drive. Ms. Shylaja is expected to visit the district headquarters on Sunday night.

The District Medical Officer told The Hindu that 10 persons, nine at Pathanamthitta General Hospital and one at the District Hospital in Kozhencherry, had been quarantined with suspected COVID-19 symptoms. This is apart from the 159 persons with primary symptoms of the disease under home quarantine in the district as on Sunday afternoon.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/41b9os/article31017196.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tvpt-ptahospital,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/five-new-covid-19-cases-in-state-total-in-india-now-39/article31018361.ece
145,2020/03/09,Action against those hiding travel history,"Quarantine period upped to 28 days again

The Health Department has warned that it will not hesitate to take legal action against persons who do not divulge their history of travel to or contact with nations from where COVID-19 has been reported and later turn out to have contracted the potentially lethal virus.

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said the Health Department’s priority now was to provide the best of care to the COVID-19 patients. But those keeping their travel history a secret just to avoid personal inconvenience, were committing a crime to society and would definitely invite further action, she said. The family that returned from Italy had endangered the entire State by their irresponsible behaviour.

Travel details of family

The Minister said it would help the Health Department trace all possible persons who might have come into contact with the family. The family had boarded the Qatar Airways flight (QR 126 – Venice-Doha), which had landed in Doha at 11.20 p.m. on February 28. They spent about one-and-a-half hours in transit at Doha airport, before boarding flight QR 514 Doha-Kochi, to reach Nedumbassery international airport at Kochi on February 29 at 8.20 a.m. From there, their daughter’s family, including a four-year-old child, dropped them in their car at their house in Pathanamthitta.

Ms. Shylaja hoped that any person in Kerala who might have returned by these flights would get in touch with the Health Department immediately (contact DISHA 1056, State COVID 19 control cell 0471-2302160/ 90723 15151) and seek advice. “The local bodies and the community should report the arrival of any person from abroad in their neighbourhood to the Health authorities,” the Minister said.

The Health Department could meet all exigencies but the situation called for responsible behaviour from the community, she said. With new COVID-19 cases being reported in the State, the Health Department decided to reinstate the 28-day home quarantine rule, which it had relaxed last month to 14 days.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/action-against-those-hiding-travel-history/article31018325.ece
146,2020/03/09,3 suspected cases in Kottayam,"They had interacted with affected persons in Pathanamthitta

The district administration has intensified preventive action against COVID-19 after three persons, who had closely interacted with the affected persons in Pathanamthitta, were admitted to the Government Medical College (GMC) in Kottayam.

Officials said the three-member family was identified following a probe by the Health Department based on the information received from Pathanamthitta. “The swab samples collected from them have been sent for an examination. If the results are negative, they may be shifted to home isolation,’’ said Jacob Varghese, District Medical Officer, Kottayam. Besides the three persons, eight more persons in the district have been directed to go under home quarantine, taking the total number of people under observation to 83.

In Kollam too

Five persons, who were in direct contact with the Italy-returned family at Kollam, have been put in isolation at Kollam Government Medical College at Parippally. Meanwhile, the Health authorities have traced two co-passengers of the affected family from Doha and put them under home isolation. “A search is on to trace the remaining persons who have travelled by the same flight,’’ the DMO added.

Private hospitals have been directed to inform the Health Department in case of identifying any suspected cases.

Ever since the emergence of reports confirming COVID-19 cases in Ranni, the medical authorities here have been receiving frantic calls from across the district.

District Collector P.K. Sudheer Babu has issued an advisory to the public to avoid attending public functions. “Efforts are on to trace the travel history of the virus-affected persons across Kottayam since February 29,’’ he said.

The meeting convened by the ADM on Sunday decided to initiate action against those charging exorbitant prices for hand sanitisers and face masks.

Public have been requested to pass on information about arrival of people from the virus-affected countries to 0481 2581900. For advise on treatment, call 1066 or 0481 2581900.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/3-suspected-cases-in-kottayam/article31018319.ece
147,2020/03/09,"Demand soars for hand-rubs, masks","Hand-disinfectants and masks have vanished from the shelves of most of the supermarkets and pharmacies with the COVID-19 scare spreading across the State. Capitalising on the panic, some firms have steeply hiked the price of products by over 100%.

Single-ply masks, the commonly used ones with one layer of protective fabric, are now being sold for ₹10 a piece against the earlier price of ₹5. The three-layered ones are sold for ₹15 a piece, said P.K. Indukala, who runs a medical store at Vennala, Kochi.

The price of N 95 masks has also been hiked significantly. The use-and-throw mask is being sold at ₹150 a piece and the suppliers are unable to meet the demand. Since the outbreak of the disease, its demand and price has peaked, said Ms. Indukala.

A lakh one-ply masks

The stitching unit set up by her family, which caters to the clothing needs of hospitals, was recently flooded with enquiries for making masks. One dealer sought to get one lakh one-ply masks ready whereas another one wanted elastic strings stitched to another 50,000 masks. There has been a three-fold increase in the price of single-ply masks, said P. K. Rameshan, who runs a medical ship at Vyttila Junction. The N 95 masks and hand-rubs are in short supply, he said.

A supermarket in Vyttila recently witnessed bulk purchase of masks and sanitisers. Two women, who said they were about to go abroad, purchased a bag full of masks. There had been an increase in the purchase of hand rubs too, said K.A. Anjas, store manager. The outbreak of the disease in China has hit the import of masks from there. Currently, only small bottles of hand sanitisers are available, he said. There is acute shortage of hand sanitisers, especially those produced by major players. Some traders are reportedly fleecing the customers by steeply hiking the price of products on which the Maximum Retail Price have not been marked, said a pharma marketing executive.

T.K. Anish, another pharmacist, regularly wears the N95 mask to protect himself while at the medical shop, as he has to interact with sick customers. “You cannot wear a new and expensive mask every day,” said Mr. Anish when asked how frequently he replaces the mask.

Earlier, workers such as painters and carpenters used to buy single-ply masks. Of late, more people are wearing them. There has been a steep hike in the demand and the price of such products, he said.

Reason for scarcity

Ravi S. Menon, Drugs Controller, Kerala, said the department would look into the scarcity and price hike of hand disinfectants used for medical purposes. The scarcity might be due to the shortage of chemicals and not hoarding. The trade of masks is not regulated by the Drugs Control Department, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/demand-soars-for-hand-rubs-masks/article31018299.ece

151,2020/03/09,River rejuvenation gets administrative sanction,"₹86.5 lakh earmarked for reviving Panakkapuzha

Included in the Kasaragod Development Package, Panakkapuzha, one of the five rivers chosen for rejuvenation as part of the comprehensive water conservation programme, has received administrative sanction.

According to E.P. Rajmohan, special officer, Kasaragod Development Project, Panakkapuzha is an agriculturally important water source in the panchayats of Kayur Cheemeni, Cheruvathur, Pilikode and Padana. Panakkapuzha passes through the residential areas of Perunthol, Nalilkandam, Thimiri, Kodakavayal, Kunduvayal, Malapp, Madivayal, Kotholi, Payyangi, Kannankai, Kavundala, and Edachakai, he said.

“An amount of ₹86.5 lakh has been earmarked for the rejuvenation of the 14-km-long Panakkapuzha, originating from Perundol in Kayur Cheemeni and extending to the Kavvayi backwaters,” he added. Of the sanctioned amount, ₹48 lakh will be utilised for minor irrigation work and ₹38.5 lakh for soil protection.

Mr. Rajmohan said the rejuvenation of Panakkapuzha would be done by removing accumulated silt, plastic, and other waste.

The process also involves setting up of boards warning people against dumping of waste into the river and constitution of a task force.

District Collector D. Sajith Babu said the rejuvenation project would prevent flooding to a certain extent. The project was approved by the district-level committee under the Kasaragod Development Package.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/river-rejuvenation-gets-administrative-sanction/article31018029.ece
152,2020/03/09,BJP’s backing helped G.K. Vasan secure Rajya Sabha nomination,"G.K. Vasan managed to get the nomination, despite DMDK and New Justice Party vying for it.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is learnt to have strongly backed the nomination of G.K. Vasan, leader of the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC), to the Rajya Sabha from Tamil Nadu where biennial election is scheduled later this month. The ruling AIADMK on Monday named him as one of the three nominees for the Upper House.

A former Congressman and Union Minister, Mr. Vasan had allied with the AIADMK-BJP in the last Lok Sabha elections declaring that his party had come a long way from the Congress since its revival, over five years ago. The TMC was allotted one Lok Sabha seat. Unlike with the PMK, the AIADMK did not enter into an express agreement with the TMC promising a berth in the Upper House.

The ruling party also nominated two of its former Ministers — M. Thambi Durai and K.P. Munusamy — both of whom had unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha elections for the biennial polls. However, it ignored the open demand of another ally Desiya Murpokku Dravidar Kazhagam (DMDK) for a Rajya Sabha berth. In the Lok Sabha polls, the DMDK was allotted four seats.

In July last year, the AIADMK allotted one of the three seats of the Rajya Sabha to another ally, Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), which nominated its youth wing leader and another former Union Minister, Anbumani Ramadoss.

Though Mr. Munusamy and Mr. Thambi Durai were expected to get the party nomination, what was not clear till late last week was who would get the third seat, as there were too many aspirants to fill the slot. In this regard, the party leadership was under enormous pressure from various quarters.

Another partner of the AIADMK, the New Justice Party too, was keen on getting the seat for its chief, A.C. Shanmugam, former MLA and MP. In the deferred election to the Vellore parliamentary seat held in August last year, Mr Shanmugam was the AIADMK’s choice but he lost by a narrow margin.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dbfxdd/article30105950.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28NOVVASAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bjps-backing-helped-gk-vasan-secure-rajya-sabha-nomination/article31023043.ece

A Mumbai police team which reached Ambur in connection with the printing and circulation of fake notes, arrested two persons from Ayyanur, near Ambur on Monday.

Police gave the names of those arrested as Baskar (43) from Saidapet in Vellore and Saravanan (42) of Ayyanur near Ambur.

A team led by Rajesh Patil from Antop Hill police station Mumbai, sought the help from Ambur Taluk police to nab the others connected in this case. Saravanan and Baskar have confessed to the crime of printing and circulating fake notes in several areas of Vellore district.

The police team seized 1,477 numbers of ₹500 fake currency notes, and 86 numbers of ₹200 currency notes (₹7,55,700) from the premises of Saravanan. Printing machine, papers, and paper cutting machine were seized by the police from the house of Saravanan, one of the accused in this case. They were produced before a court in Ambur and taken to Mumbai.

Crime branch police said that Mumbai police team reached Ambur based on a statement made by one of the accused arrested four days ago in Mumbai. He mentioned the name of Baskar, an ex-prisoner, who was involved in fake currency circulation in Mumbai. It was said that Baskar came into contact with Ibrahim of Mumbai, while he was in Vellore Central Prison.

The duo decided to print and circulate fake currencies in denominations of ₹200 and ₹500 in the house of Saravanan of Ambur. Baskar had already started circulating fake notes in Ambur, Vaniyambadi and Tirupattur and he had circulated a few notes through Ibrahim in Mumbai.

The Mumbai Crime Branch busted a counterfeit currency note racket run by three persons where superior quality Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) were being printed and circulated by the gang. The gang printed ₹500 counterfeit currency notes and then circulated them in the market by mixing them with the original notes.

The striking feature in the counterfeit notes recovered by the investigating team was the watermark which was similar to those found on the original notes. After checking the notes carefully, it was found that some features were missing and paper used for the notes was different than the ones used for original ones.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/mumbai-police-arrests-two-persons-near-ambur-for-fake-currency-printing-and-circulation/article31023040.ece

“India is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious, multi-cultural and multi-political country. The graduates should understand the history of the country and commit themselves to respecting and cherishing its diversity,” he said.

Delivering the 41st graduation day address, Mr. Ram urged the graduands to remain secular. Any deviation from the path of equality and the doctrine of non-discrimination would be disastrous, he said.

He urged students to not bring religion into politics or use it for political gains. He praised the college for its liberal and progressive approach to education. He compared it to The Hindu, both of which, as old establishments, had to constantly innovate and reinvent themselves to prepare for challenges.

“The MCC had a liberal and progressive approach to education. It has been known for its excellence in education while maintaining accessibility,” he said. He recalled his experiences with former principals and professors of the institution when he had to take a few classes in history during his college days.

160,2020/03/09,All-women crew operate Uday Express to commemorate International Women’s Day,"From locopilot to ticket inspectors, the Salem division signalled change in operations

When the double-decker Coimbatore-Bengaluru Uday Express chugged out on Sunday morning, it was not a routine run for the train.

At the controls were locopilot H. Nimmy and assistant locopilot B.J. Sindhu. S. Mareena was the guard and the five-member ticket checking team, led by Chief Travelling Ticket Inspector P.R. Savithri conducted the core duties of the train. In a first to mark International Women’s Day, the all-women crew from the Salem division of the Southern Railway operated the superfast train.

Station Manager of Salem junction Sapna Soni flagged off the train, saying it was a moment of pride for them. “It is a great day for women in the Division and we feel far more enthusiastic,” she said.

For Ms. Nimmy, the only woman locopilot in the Division, it was a Red Letter day as she was operating a superfast train for the first time in her career.

Ms. Uma Maheswari said it was the first time an all-women crew operated a train under the Division and it was an honour for the entire women staff.

Ms. Savithri, 53, said she had been working in the train ever since the service was launched in June 2018 and said the passengers had been very encouraging.

According to officials, though there has not been any gender restrictions for positions in the organisation, the recruitment of women candidates for technical positions saw an increase after 2010.

There are 1,131 women staff across departments under the Salem Division, including 73 assistant locopilots, four guards, 19 station masters, 294 in the engineering department, 125 in mechanical department,13 in Railway Protection Force, 10 in traction and 37 in Signal and Telecommunications.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/all-women-crew-operate-uday-express-to-commemorate-international-womens-day/article31018469.ece
161,2020/03/09,Anbazhagan struck a balance between literature and politics,"He wrote 30 books on various subjects

Having studied at Annamalai University when it was one of the greatest higher educational institutions in the State with some of the best minds, Dravidian stalwart K. Anbazhagan, who died on Saturday, struck a balance between his literary pursuits and politics.

He ran a magazine named Puthuvaazhvu, which was launched on a Pongal Day in 1948.

“But unlike Murasoli [founded by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi], Puthuvaazhvu confined politics to the editorials of the magazine. The other pages were dedicated to literature, social issues and book reviews. But it had no reservations when it came to criticising the Congress government,” recalled K. Thirunavukkarasu, a historian of the Dravidian Movement.

Anbazhagan, who served as the general secretary of the DMK for 43 years till his death, was a great admirer of poet Subramania Bharati, though Dravidian leaders regarded Bharathidasan as the poet of their Movement.

“If western scholars delve deep into Tamil and bring out its greatness, we appreciate their efforts. Similarly, we have to appreciate Bharathiar, and the question of his caste or race never comes into the picture,” Anbazhagan had once told Mr. Thirunavukkarasu.

Tirukkuṛaḷ commentary

The DMK stalwart was keen on writing commentaries for Tirukkuṛaḷ and read almost every single work on the subject.

DMK founder C.N. Annadurai, who was lodged with him in jail in 1963, had recorded what he had seen in the cell.

“Anbazhagan was surrounded by Valluvar. Yes. There was Parimelazhagar’s Valluvar, Parithimarkaignar’s Valluvar, Varatharasanar’s Valluvar, Ilakkuvanar’s Valluvar, Namakkallar’s Valluvar, Ki.Va. Jagannathan’s Valluvar and Manakkudavar’s Valluvar. He was writing a research book. I had the opportunity to discuss it with him,” Annadurai had reminisced.

Anbazhagan later gave up the idea of writing commentaries on Tirukkuṛaḷ, arguing that there were already enough books on the subject. He did, however, author 30 books on various subjects, including literature, Tamil marriages and the Dravidian Movement.

While working at Pachaiyappa’s College, he would ride a bicycle to the premises. Recalling one of his classes in a book, Mu. Sathasivam, a former student of the college, noted: “He taught Villibharatham for 40 minutes and dedicated 20 minutes to a conversation with students, and inculcated in them the idea of rationalism.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/mm01h0/article31018445.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09DMKANBAZHAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/anbazhagan-struck-a-balance-between-literature-and-politics/article31018446.ece
162,2020/03/09,Unused classrooms may become dining halls for mid-day meals,"Social Welfare, School Education Departments hold meeting to discuss proposal.

The Social Welfare and the School Education Departments are looking to have dedicated dining halls in schools to serve mid-day meals for children.

A meeting was held by the officials of the departments about the proposal to convert unused classrooms into dining rooms.

School Education Director S. Kannappan told The Hindu that they are preparing a list of schools across the State where the project could be implemented.

“We have asked officials to select one higher secondary school in every block which has empty classrooms that can be converted into dining rooms. The detailed list will be handed over to the Social Welfare Department,” he said.

The Social Welfare Department is expected to take the initiative forward. The School Education Department too for a while has been mulling having dining rooms in bigger schools which have space to spare. The Presidency Girls Higher Secondary School in Chennai, a model government school, has a dining room for students with plastic chairs and tables and the walls painted colourfully.

V. Saravanan, a teacher from Ranipet and the deputy State president of the Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Association, said it would be a welcome initiative across all government schools. “At present, children eat their mid-day meals under trees or near playgrounds in schools and never inside their classrooms. In government schools which have a large campus and student strength, there are often classrooms which are not in use that can be converted into dining halls,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/unused-classrooms-may-become-dining-halls-for-mid-day-meals/article31018426.ece
163,2020/03/09,Many Under-Secretary posts lying vacant in govt. departments,"Pending litigation cited as reason

About half of the posts of Under-Secretary in various departments at the Secretariat are lying vacant.

Of the more than 200 such posts in 37 departments (regarded as one unit, excluding Finance and Law Departments) at the Secretariat, a little over 100 are currently vacant. While pending litigation in the Madras High Court is often cited as a reason behind the delay in appointing the Under-Secretaries, a section of the staff pointed out that appointment orders had previously been issued promoting staff to the post with a caveat that it would be subject to the outcome of the litigation. “The primary reason for the hold-up is a dispute between direct recruits and promotees, who joined government service as typists, and who have staked their claim to be appointed as Under-Secretaries. The dispute has been going on for a long time. If the government takes legal opinion on the issue, it could be resolved. Otherwise, if either party wins the case, naturally the other would file an appeal. Governance has been affected due to the dispute,” a bureaucrat claimed. A Section Officer said Under-Secretaries deal with files in three to four sections in a department and assist their seniors in taking decisions on the files. “In some departments, about 90% of these posts are vacant. It is due to the delay in promotions for about two years that the clearing of files is taking time. It will also eventually affect the promotions of Assistant Section Officers and Assistants. It is a cyclical issue,” he said.

164,2020/03/09,"Three patients under hospital isolation, says Health Minister","‘Till date, 1,22,318 passengers have been screened at airports in the State’

As of Sunday, three patients were under hospital isolation and 1,088 passengers were under home quarantine for 28 days, State health authorities have said.

Apart from a man hailing from Kancheepuram, who arrived here from Oman and tested positive for the novel coronavirus, a person from the city who went to Nepal, where he came into contact with a relative from Japan, has been kept under isolation for a week now. The third person who is under isolation is from Texas, and was admitted to hospital early on Sunday morning. Till date, 1,22,318 passengers have been screened at the airports in Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai, and Coimbatore. Health officials have lifted 68 samples from passengers so far, and have sent them to the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy, and the National Institute of Virology, Pune, for testing. The samples of 60 passengers have been processed, and 59 of them have tested negative for the virus. “Eight [samples] are being processed, and one sample has tested positive for COVID-19 infection,” a health bulletin said.

All those arriving from China, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Iran and Italy, or those who have a travel history to these countries, have been instructed to remain under strict home quarantine or hospital isolation for 28 days from the date of arrival into the country.

The condition of the passengers being kept under observation at home and in hospital is stable. “The male passenger with a travel history to Oman, who tested positive for the virus, is also stable, and is under hospital observation. He will be discharged after two consecutive samples test negative,” an official said.

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar told mediapersons that the patient who is under hospital quarantine had been referred to the GH after he developed fever. “The patient is diabetic, and his condition is now stable,” he said. A sample from another person who arrived from Texas has been lifted, and his condition is said to be stable. “He is asymptomatic but under observation. We have put under surveillance eight persons, including the family members and the taxi driver who had been in contact with the patient who arrived from Oman. They are under home quarantine,” he said. “There is no need to panic or fear the infection. There is no need to wear a mask. Only those who treat patients with the infection, including sanitary workers, need to wear them. Those whose immunity is compromised also need to wear masks. Airport authorities wear masks as they are screening about 8,500 people a day,” he said.

He said it was more important to follow hygiene measures like washing hands with soap and water.

The Centre’s move was an affront to social justice, he said.

In a statement, the PMK leader said a caste-wise census should be carried out at least in Tamil Nadu alone.

The Centre was going back on its promise that the 2021 census will seek details about OBCs, he said. “Registrar and Census Commissioner Vivek Joshi has said that collecting details about OBCs will affect the quality of data collection during the 2021 census. This goes against the promise made by the Centre. In 2018, then Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that details about OBCs will be collected as part of the census,” he noted.

Dr. Ramadoss said it was essential that the country conducted a caste-wise census. “Not just reservation, but social welfare schemes should also be provided to people in need. The Centre should not delay the caste-wise census, thinking it’s controversial,” he said.

167,2020/03/09,18 from T.N. stranded in Egypt,"Chennai resident with symptoms of COVID-19 in hospital

As many as 18 Indians, all from Tamil Nadu, are among those stranded on the cruise ship, ‘A Sara’, which remains anchored in the Nile, near the city of Luxor in Egypt, for the fifth day after 33 passengers and 12 crew members tested positive for COVID-19.

A passenger from Coimbatore, who spoke to The Hindu over phone on Sunday, said the passengers, most of them over 50 years, are in a state of panic as they were yet to hear from the Ministry of External Affairs and Indian Embassy in Egypt about evacuation efforts.

Of the 18 from Tamil Nadu, an engineer from Chennai, was shifted to a hospital in the port city of Alexandria on Saturday after he developed symptoms of COVID-19.

The passengers left the country on February 27 and were supposed to return on March 7.

Salem-based Grand Royal Tours had organised the tour and the package included a cruise on the Nile river.

The cruise ship had 171 passengers on board as per reports of international media.

A bellboy was the first to test positive.

“The crew told us that we will be quarantined for 14 more days. We were asked to remain in rooms. The crew is not providing us food on time and not asking about medical requirements of passengers who are senior citizens. The crew is also not communicating to passengers properly, who are all in a state of panic,” said Vanitha Rengaraj, 60. founder of Sharanalayam orphanage in Coimbatore, who along with her husband R. Rengaraj, 62, are among the stranded strangers.

“The crew members forcibly took the Chennai native to a hospital, leaving his wife in the ship. They do not respond to our queries,” she alleged.

When Egypt had one case of COVID-19, Ms. Rangaraj, who had booked the package in advance, asked the tour operator whether it was safe to travel to the country. The operator guaranteed a safe tour.

According to her, the U.S. government evacuated their passengers from the ship a few days ago.

Mr. Rengaraj’s daughter Saranya Rengaraj said that the matter was communicated to the Indian Embassy in Egypt through the tour operator.

“We do not know whether the government knows about the stranded Indians. We expect them to take immediate measures for their safety and return,” she said.

Seeking help for the evacuation of her parents and other Indians, Ms. Saranya tweeted about the situation, tagging the official Twitter handles of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Prime Minister’s Office and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. An official from the Indian Embassy met the group and assured that they would do their best, she said.

Arun Pandiyan, general manager of Grand Royal Tours in Salem, said all measures were being taken for the safe return of passengers from Tamil Nadu.

He said the passengers were being provided with food, though there are some delay since it cannot be cooked in the ship due to COVID-19 positive reports. The return was delayed after one of the persons on the ship being affected by COVID-19 was reported to one of the persons on the cruise ship.

“We are in contact with the Embassies there and measures are being taken to bring them back. The test results of all members in the group has returned negative except for the Chennai-based passenger. However, the passenger told us he does not have any symptoms and we have requested for recheck,” he said

169,2020/03/09,Coronavirus: 15-20% impact on revenues of big ticket Hindi films,"Far less on South industry; board exams and protests too factors, say observers

Baaghi 3, at ₹17.5 crore net, may have logged in the highest opening day collections for a Hindi film in 2020 so far, but it is also the first to face the adverse effect of the COVID-19 outbreak. According to the box office forecast of trade magazine Super Cinema, the opening day range for director Ahmed Khan’s Tiger Shroff starrer had been projected at a much higher range — between ₹26 and ₹28 crore — than what has been delivered. “Weekend was better but the trends have been lower than expected, the collections have been affected nationwide,” says Amul Mohan, editor of the magazine.

Shailesh Kapoor, CEO of media consulting firm Ormax Media, concurs. Ormax’s opening day projections for the film had also been substantially higher at ₹21 crore. Its projections for the forthcoming Sooryavanshi stand at a whopping ₹30.8 crore. However, in a virus-less market, the same figure for the Rohit Shetty biggie starring Akshay Kumar, would have been even higher at about ₹36 crore, says Mr. Kapoor.

He predicts a 15-20% impact on the big ticket Hindi films in the coming months and an even bigger one on the medium and small films which, as opposed to the tentpole films, are anyhow regarded as “easier to skip for a later day”. According to him, Homi Adjania’s Irrfan Khan starrer, Angrezi Medium, that releases coming Friday, may face a 25-30% impact.

The impact has been felt far less in South film industries with fewer cases detected so far. An Ormax study of the impact of COVID-19 on theatre-going behaviour in India conducted across 80 cities in the Hindi-Tamil-Telugu industries belt on Thursday-Friday-Saturday last week showed that 23% regular theatre goers in India are likely to stay away from theatres till the threat is reduced. The proportion is higher in Hindi speaking markets (26%) than in South India (17%).

In view of the situation which is changing day to day, Ormax would be conducting the study every three days and coming up with the findings twice a week. The next round of figures will be out of this Thursday.

Delhi-based exhibitor Sanjay Mehta, however, thinks there are several factors — not just COVID-19 — eating into the earnings of Baaghi 3 and other recent Bollywood films. “The low pre-holi period and board exams have come in the way and Baaghi is a predominantly youth-oriented franchisee,” he says. The law and order, violence and protests have affected business in Delhi; the late evening and night shows — largely patronised by Muslims — are running empty in Uttar Pradesh.

According to Mr. Mehta, things will come to a head if things go out of control in the weeks ahead and if the government decides to shut down theatres temporarily. He remembers the case of a film Main Khiladi Tu Anari distributed by him back in 1994. “It started off at 100% collection. On the 6th day, the Delhi government ordered cinema closure due to a plague scare. The film couldn’t gather the same momentum when the theatres reopened,” he remembers.

According to Mr. Kapoor, more than the individual collections, it’s the possible changes in release calendar that are more worrying and will throw things in a tizzy. Already there are rumours in the market about Reliance Entertainment delaying Sooryavanshi, slated for a March 24 release, and Kabir Khan’s 83 with Ranveer Singh doing a Kapil Dev that is supposed to come out on April 10. A Sooryavanshi spokesperson, however, clarified that the decision is still awaited and will be taken only on Wednesday.

“A massive 27-film franchisee like Bond has a bigger market and a lot more at stake but the seven-month postponement because of the outbreak could make even the bigger Bollywood producers do a rethink,” says Mr. Mohan.

“It will mean that there will be no film of sizeable scale and star cast in the next 3-4 weeks. March and April will become dead months if there is no content,” says Mr. Kapoor. The first quarter has anyhow been bad with only Tanhaji and Baaghi 3 faring well.

The only other time the industry had faced such a crisis in recent past was during demonetisation. However, things had stabilised by the time of the big XMas releases in December. Uncertainty is a big factor now when it comes to the COVID-19 outbreak, with the situation volatile and changing by the day. A lot, however, will still depend on how Baaghi 3 fares in the first week.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/d59gnf/article31025231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-CINEMA-MUMBAI-ARC,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/covid-19-15-20-impact-on-revenues-of-big-ticket-hindi-films/article31025196.ece

Subbu adds, “Director Puri Jagannadh is from our neighbouring village and so we took him as our inspiration and followed him and his ideals. The same way, the hero in the film takes the icons behind him on a poster as an inspiration. Love, late night texts, wasting time on impressing people is dealt with. There is a twist in the girl’s character and I don’t want to reveal it at this stage. If there is no girl, there is no godava and no gola in our lives and this phase comes to all at certain time in life. You will realise what we mean after a break up. My married friends keep telling me that I should put off marriage as long as I can.”

‘It is time’

Speaking about his journey, Subbu informs that things started looking up for him when he moved into cinematographer Rasool’s team and got into his writing department and also worked as an assistant DoP and then became an associate director in Ooseravelli as an assistant DoP and as an associate director to Bommarillu Bhaskar’s Ongole gitta and Virinchi Verma’s Majnu. Post Majnu and Nannu Dochukundavate, he gained confidence and decided it’s time for him to direct a film and began working on a story.

The experience he accumulated he thought was enough to face problems and find solutions during filmmaking. “No one spoon feeds you, you have to take an initiative and show that you are interested in working in a particular department. We have to keep our eyes and ears open to grasp every small thing from each director including their vibes,” says Subbu.

The story for Solo brathuke... was an offshoot of an idea he saw on YouTube. “Many incidents that happened in that video had happened in my life too and I connected to it immediately. There are too many directors and stars have many options these days. For me, producer Bapineedu was a blessing. He liked my story and took it forward.”

Subbu is all praise for cinematographer Dileep. “He had an amazing quality of showing his visuals in an aesthetic way and music director Thaman delivered good music. Solo brathuke so better has a message which is simple and straight. It will trace the life of a youth who believes in such philosophy,” adds Subbu.

The film is releasing on May 1 and Subbu wants to see at the theatres in Visakhapatnam where he spent most of his younger days watching films at Jagadamba theatre and other places.Finally Subbu says the kick of being a director is on a different plane, “I remember someone saying in an interview that Brahma kept a few people aside when creating the world and these people are movie directors. They create a parallel world of entertainment and escapism for people.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4y9x7m/article31021392.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym09subbujpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/director-subbu-for-telugu-film-solo-brathuke-so-better/article31021393.ece
172,2020/03/09,"‘Kappela’ movie review: Promising debut, but with a dampener effect","The director painstakingly develops the plot only to squander away the effort by not finishing it in style

A particular kind of deftness in craft, surprising in a debutant filmmaker, marks Muhammad Musthafa’s handling of a pretty thin story in the initial parts of Kappela. Yet, it is only with a sinking feeling that one can watch him squandering what he had so painstakingly set up, when it comes to finishing it in style.

Jessy (Anna Ben)’s call to a wrong number sets off an unlikely romance with autorickshaw driver Vishnu (Roshan Mathew).

For an academically weak girl living in an orthodox, lower middle class family, in a high range village with hardly anything to look forward to, the voice on the other side becomes a ray of hope for a better life.

Kappela Cast: Anna Ben, Sreenath Bhasi, Roshan Mathew

Direction: Muhammad Musthafa

The director portrays her as having a fun time with her close friend, to whom she passingly expresses these disappointments in a playful manner, at the same time giving one a sense that these are things that has affected her much more deeply.

Things take a turn when the couple decide to meet finally and a third character — Roy (Sreenath Bhasi) — enters their lives by chance.

Surprising turn

To give us a sense of Roy’s rough character, the script commendably cuts off from the love story at a key point. It is meant to create in our minds an expectation of how the rest of the film will pan out.

That is when the director unleashes upon the audience the trick up his sleeve, which can be rewarding or disappointing, depending on which way you look at it.

Strictly from the filmmaking point of view, it is an unexpected turn, which can satisfy the viewers, although executed too swiftly. It does talk about a much-discussed issue, but this could have been much more than just another movie with a message.

When one looks at how the movie’s message can be misused by those wanting to curtail the agency of women to make decisions concerning their lives, especially their relationship choices, the turn that the script takes is disappointing.

The otherwise well-intentioned makers may have inadvertently provided a respectable tool for the moral policing gangs. In the end, when Jessy is convinced by an educated girl to not go in for legal options, it becomes a cautionary tale for women deciding their life on their own, rather than resign to the one chosen by their parents.

Lot of promise

The performances, especially of Sreenath Bhasi and Anna Ben, who essays a character similar to her previous two, elevate the movie a few notches.

173,2020/03/09,A life in service of senior citizens,"Asrath Fathima serves inmates of a Hindu-run orphanage

In one of the shining examples of communal harmony in the district, a Muslim woman is working and serving senior citizens at an old-age home and orphanage maintained by a Hindu philanthropist, and is winning accolades for her service to the hapless people.

When Sri Veerabrahmendra Swamy Orphanage was opened by one Veeramadhav in Housing Board Colony on the outskirts of Karimnagar town some 18 years ago, Asrath Fathima alias Asra, who was just 13-years-old then, and residing along with her family in the same locality, approached the orphanage for a job because of her abject poverty. Besides, she also stopped going to school after completing Class VII.

Incidentally, she did not ask any money for her work in the orphanage, but only asked two square meals for her and her family who were living in poverty because of ill-health of her father and mother. Moved by Asra’s plight, philanthropist Veeramadhav asked her to work in the orphanage by cooking and serving food to the inmates. Though she was not good at cooking, she learnt it from her mother and won the hearts of the residents with her delicious dishes.

As she was getting food, clothing and some financial assistance — donated by the people visiting the orphanage — she dedicated her life to serve the inmates. Now, at the age of 28, she has become ‘Amma’ for around 38 senior citizens living in the orphanage. She helps the senior citizens when they are sick by providing medicines distributed by philanthropic doctors and feeds them and even helps the senior citizens in bathing and in wearing clothes.

Talking to The Hindu, Asra said: “I have decided to dedicate my life to serve these old people who are discarded by their children. I have decided to remain unmarried and serve the inmates and treat the senior citizens as my children. There is no religion in serving humanity.”

“I am very happy to work in orphanage as its organiser helps me and my family. He is paying my house rent, besides meeting other family expenses. The doctors who visit the orphanage provide free medical assistance at their hospitals to me and my family after seeing my service to the aged,” she said. Philanthropist Veeramadhav said Asra has also become one of the founder of the orphanage and her dedicated service has helped it become what it is today. Incidentally, she also helped in conduct of funeral of 116 inmates, he added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/job23j/article31026377.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09ASRA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/a-life-in-service-of-senior-citizens/article31026378.ece
174,2020/03/09,Scrap GO 111 to help small ryots: Jagga Reddy,"Many permanent structures have come up in last 20 years, says Sangareddy MLA

At a time when a section of the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) is building up momentum against violations of the provisions of GO 111, senior Congress MLA T. Jayaprakash Reddy alias Jagga Reddy has demanded that the State government withdraw the GO to help the farmers belonging to the SC and BC communities.

Working president of TPCC A. Revanth Reddy went near a farmhouse in Janwada village, falling under the areas in purview of the GO, along with his supporters and former Chevella MP Konda Vishveshwar Reddy on March 2 with a view to prove the allegation that Minister for Municipal Administration K.T. Rama Rao’s family members have constructed it in violation of the provisions of GO 111. Mr. Reddy was arrested later on the charges of violation of privacy.

In a statement issued here on Monday, the Sangareddy legislator said there was a lot of criticism and differences on the issue between the Congress and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). A large number of small and marginal farmers having small landholdings in 84 villages falling in the area included in the GO were facing a lot of difficulties due to it. The villages come under the erstwhile Shamshabad, Moinabad, Shahbad, Shankarpally, Rajendranagar and Chevella mandals.

An effort was made during the previous Congress dispensation to withdraw the GO and the Centre was also moved for the purpose, but it did not happen due to various reason. However, a large number of permanent structures had come up during the last 20 years, mostly in Janwada, Shankarpally, Gandipet and other areas, Mr. Jagga Reddy stated.

“Not just KTR but a large number of industrialists and others have buildings/properties in the area and there’s no need for making a political fuss on it,” the Congress MLA said and requested Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to withdraw the GO to help the small and marginal farmers in the area.

Interestingly, Mr. Jagga Reddy was among the six Congress legislators who tried to go to the farmhouse near Janwada on Saturday after they were suspended from the Assembly for a day by the Speaker. There was greater loss to the Congress party in Telangana from the internal enemies than outsiders, political opponents, Mr. Jagga Reddy said in the statement.

The GO 111 was issued during the combined Andhra Pradesh administration in 1996 banning construction of permanent structures for protection of the catchment areas areas of Himayatsagar and Osmansagar lakes to ensure rainwater drainage system bring water to the two lakes.

Incidentally, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao, as TRS president, promised to withdraw the GO 111 in the run up to 2014 Assembly elections.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/g8y1nm/article31026415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10JAGGA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/scrap-go-111-to-help-small-ryots-jagga-reddy/article31025935.ece
175,2020/03/09,Fresh tenders to be called to complete Mission Bhagiratha,"Cabinet cancelled contract as the agency could not raise funds

The apprehensions of the banks in the backdrop of Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi episodes have cast its shadow on a major component of Mission Bhagiratha, to take clean water to all households.

The pending work is completing internal pipeline network in 38 municipalities of the State after the boundaries of the towns were linked to the water grid. The State government cancelled the contract at the last Cabinet meeting as the agency failed to raise funds from banks after instances of they getting defrauded came to light one after another. The government has appointed a high-level committee to study to what extent the agency could be compensated in these circumstances as not a rupee was paid to it so far.

The firm was awarded the contract in September 2017 on annuity basis which was experimented by the government for the first time. The works were given in three packages for ₹ 1,061 crore on the condition that the firm will invest 30% as equity and raise funds for the balance 70% from banks and financial institutions. The payment was to be made by government over seven years but not a rupee was paid because there was no such provision in the contract if the works remained incomplete, sources said.

Government guarantee

Having invested its 30% equity, the firm failed to raise loan from banks despite best efforts of the government to stand guarantee. On the other hand, another big company fully executed the works on annuity basis but their work was only worth ₹ 160 crore.

When contacted, Engineer-in-Chief of Public Health Dhan Singh told The Hindu that the committee will go into what could be done.

Having cancelled the contract, the government has decided to invite fresh tenders for the balance of work. It has allotted ₹ 800 crore for the purpose in the budget presented to the Assembly on Sunday.

Most work complete

Apart from rural areas of the State, the government is implementing Mission Bhagiratha in 141 municipalities and municipal corporations, excluding Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. Barring 38 municipalities where the work was held up on account of this problem, the works were completed everywhere else. A small portion of work was also pending in Khammam town, sources added.

The project contractors were supposed to take care of the maintenance of the entire water network for 10 years at no additional cost to government. The project envisaged supply of 150 litres of drinking water per person per month in urban areas while the same was 100 litres in rural areas.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/h77k7u/article31025721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10BHAGIRATHATAP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/fresh-tenders-to-be-called-to-complete-mission-bhagiratha/article31025659.ece

Vice Chairman of the Telangana State Planning Board B. Vinod Kumar along with a team of State government officials and those having expertise on bamboo visited Kudal area in Sidhudurg district of Maharashtra for two days for studying bamboo cultivation and bamboo-based industries.

Mr. Vinod Kumar, accompanied by Horticulture Commissioner L. Venkatrami Reddy, Director of Centre for Innovations in Public Systems, an autonomous wing of the Administrative Staff College of India, C. Achalender Reddy, non-resident Indians having expertise in bamboo including Srinivas Gogineni, Shudhir Kodati, Krishna Komandla and others, interacted with the bamboo farmers there and enquired about the cultivation practices.

Noting that there were good opportunities for bamboo cultivation in Telangana since the plant has several uses, he said by encouraging farmers to go for bamboo farming in some areas their incomes could be improved. The delegation visited Konkan bamboo industries in the Kudal industrial estate, where they were told that the Centre had been giving incentives for bamboo cultivation after establishing National Bamboo Mission in 2004.

According to the officials of the visiting team, they were told that the mission was strengthened further in 2017 by issue new guidelines to encourage bamboo cultivation. Utilising the opportunity, several farmers in the Kudal area had taken to bamboo farming and were earning good income.

They were also explained by the farmers that bamboo could be cut for commercial purposes every year from the fourth years onwards from its planting and it would withstand adverse weather conditions too. It could be cultivated in the lands not useful for traditional cropping and the bamboo groves emit lot of oxygen by consuming carbon dioxide.

During the visit to the industrial area, they were told that that bamboo could be extensively used for making doors, windows, flooring and other needs in housing in the coming years as the availability of conventional timber varieties such as teak falls. They were explained that bamboo strips could be heat-pressed into strong door and window planks. Besides, various craft products could also be made with bamboo.

Mr. Vinod Kumar felt that bamboo cultivation could be useful in Singareni mining areas as it would also reduce pollution.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/xjjzft/article31025293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy10Vinod,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bamboo-cultivation-holds-lot-of-promise-for-ts-vinod-kumar/article31025295.ece
177,2020/03/09,Should officers be allowed to receive gifts from foreign dignitaries?,"DoPT seeks States’ views on proposed change in AIS (Conduct) Rules

The Central government is contemplating to allow the All India Services officers to accept and retain gifts from foreign dignitaries.

The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has asked the chief secretaries of the State governments and Union Territories to give their views relating to amendments proposed to the AIS (Conduct) Rules 1968. According to the existing rules, a member of the service may accept gifts from his near relatives or from personal friends having no official dealings with them on occasions like wedding, anniversaries, funerals and religious functions when making of gifts is in conformity with the prevailing religious and social practice. “But he shall make a report to the government if the value of such gift exceeds ₹25,000.”

The gift, according to rules, includes free transport, free boarding, free lodging or any other service or pecuniary advantage when provided by a person other than a near relative or personal friend having no official dealing with the member of the service. Likewise, rules mandate that no member of service should accept any gift without the sanction of the government if the value of the gift exceeds ₹5,000. Member of the service should also avoid accepting lavish hospitality or frequent hospitality from persons having official dealings with them or from industrial or commercial firms or other organisations.

In this background, the DoPT said it would insert a sub-rule allowing a member of service, being a member of Indian delegation or otherwise, “may receive and retain gifts from foreign dignitaries in accordance with the provisions of The Foreign Contribution (Acceptance or Retention of Gifts or Presentation) Rules 2012.” The DoPT set March 31 as deadline for the chief secretaries to submit their views/comments. “If no reply is received within the stipulated time, it will be presumed that State government has no objection to the proposed amendments,” the latter said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/should-officers-be-allowed-to-receive-gifts-from-foreign-dignitaries/article31025002.ece

179,2020/03/09,Budget comes as disappointment to govt staff,"Employees, teachers still hopeful of announcement soon

The budget for the financial year 2020-21 introduced in the Legislature on Sunday has come as disappointment to the government employees and teachers who were hoping for some announcement relating to pay hike for the employees.

While the revenue expenditure has seen a significant rise in the budget introduced by Finance Minister T. Harish Rao, there was no mention about the wage hike for employees. The development comes in the light of recent announcement by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao that the government was committed to the welfare of the employees and that an announcement would be made on the quantum of their pay hike sooner or later.

In the light of the Chief Minister’s announcement and the significant increase in the revenue expenditure to ₹ 1.38 lakh crore from the ₹ 1.11 lakh crore of the current fiscal, the employees were hopeful that an announcement would be made regarding their wage hike. But no such announcement was forthcoming in the budget speech indicating that the revenue expenditure was enhanced in view of the increase in the size of the budget outlay.

Coupled with this was the nominal rise in the heads of accounts specifically dealing with the employees’ cost. The State government had already extended the tenure of the Pay Revision Commission headed by retired bureaucrat C.R. Biswal till December-end this year to finalise the report and recommendations of pay pattern as well as make suggestions on the changes that are needed to the services rules to make the administration more accountable to the people.

Senior officials said the government was very particular that the cumbersome service rules be revised so that the accounts of the employees could be settled on the day of retirement itself to avoid inconvenience to them. The employees unions, however, are optimistic that an announcement on this count will be made soon.

Representatives of the unions are hopeful that the Chief Minister would make the government’s intentions clear on or after Ugadi. “There is no need to incorporate the pay revision related matters in the budget. The government can directly make an announcement and the Finance department will make allocations accordingly,” an official said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/budget-comes-as-disappointment-to-govt-staff/article31024919.ece
180,2020/03/09,Pattana Pragathi helps Mahabubnagar address some unique civic issues,"Relocation of petty vendors, constructing toilets for visitors in govt. utilities taken up

Petty vendors in the district headquarters town of Mahabubnagar will soon have designated (specified) space for carrying out their livelihood activities without causing obstruction to the movement of traffic by creating bottlenecks with their unwarranted trespassing.

The issue is among a few such problems identified during the ‘Pattana Pragathi’ programme held in the municipal towns from February 24 to March 4. The district administration and the urban local bodies concerned have got down to address such issues which have remained unattended for long in Mahabubnagar, Badepally (Jadcharla) and Bhoothpur.

According to officials, they have identified the need to construct separate toilets for women and men in key government offices and other utilities visited by people frequently besides resolving the neglected sanitation issue during the urban rejuvenation programme. At a review meeting held here on Friday, Minister for Municipal Administration K.T. Rama Rao termed the exercise “a success” and asked officials to shift focus to addressing the identified problems.

As part of identifying chronic problems, the civic officials of Mahabubnagar noted that petty vendors with their livelihood activities on push carts and with street-side make-shift shops, mostly on pavements at locations where the movement of public is high, have been creating traffic bottlenecks and adding to the chaos. Another major problem identified was lack of public toilets for floating public, who come to towns from villages every day for various needs, including work in government offices.

“We have identified 13 locations in Mahabubnagar to begin with for relocating about 360 petty vendors by providing them temporary sheds to carry out their livelihoods, instead of encroaching pavements and roads, without causing inconvenience to traffic movement and other road users,” District Collector S. Venkata Rao said. Similarly, they have identified premises of 13 office and utilities for constructing 90 toilets including 41 for women and 49 for men.

Offices such as Collectorate, RTA, DCCB, R&B and Irrigation and utilities including Government Hospital, Agricultural Market Yard, Old Bus Stand and others have toilets for visitors/commuters. “By constructing toilets we hope to bring down open defecation and improve sanitation in areas with large number of visitors,” the District Collector said adding that construction of toilets at Government Hospital and a couple of other locations has already begun.

Another issue addressed during ‘Pattana Pragathi’ was construction of drains in Bhagiratha Colony (22nd ward) where people have been facing highly unhygienic conditions due to overflowing drainage for more than 10 years. Proposals for laying internal roads were also moved to improve the condition, a supervisory officer involved in the programme stated.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ia7i6u/article31024373.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy07bhagirathacolony-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pattana-pragathi-helps-mnagar-address-some-unique-civic-issues/article31024377.ece

Unseasonal rains accompanied by gales and hailstorm have caused extensive damage to standing crops such as maize, paddy, vegetables, and mango plantations in various parts of the integrated Karimnagar district on Sunday evening.

For farmers of the district, it was a double whammy. They are already worried with the outbreak of rice blast disease hitting paddy crops. Now, the untimely rains have dealt another blow flattening maize and paddy crops. Mango plantatations which are in the flowering stage too were hit badly.

Uprooted electric poles

The impact of the gales was such, some electric poles got uprooted disrupting power supply in rural areas. In Gattududdenapalli village of Manakondur mandal, an electric transformer was also uprooted by powerful gales.

Choppadandi legislator Sunke Ravishankar visited the rain-affected fields in Rukmapur village of Choppadandi mandal and consoled the farmers. He assured them that he would take it up with the government and provide compensation accordingly.

Rice blast disease attack

Rythu Ikya Vedika district president M. Venkat Reddy said the farming community was at the receiving end in the district with rice blast disease attack on paddy fields resulting in a steep fall in the harvest. “Even as farmers are yet to recover from the shock, the unseasonal rains had created havoc by damaging the standing crops,” he complained.

Mr. Reddy said the rains and gales had caused huge damage to paddy and maize crops. He urged the government to conduct a survey on the extent of damage and crop losses, and provide compensation of at least ₹ 25,000 per acre. He also urged the government to waive crop loans to the tune of ₹ 1 lakh at a time instead of only ₹ 25,000 as announced by the government.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/sudden-rains-and-gales-hit-standing-crops-in-telangana/article31022971.ece

185,2020/03/09,Rao was a complete introvert,"‘He could have picked up pesticide bottle from his friend’s shop’

The long and final drive of Tirunagaru Maruthi Rao from Miryalaguda to Hyderabad on Saturday evening was without a halt anywhere on the 150-km national highway.

Family members suspect that he would have picked up a pesticide bottle from his close pal’s fertiliser shop in Miryalaguda before hitting the road with his driver Bellamkonda Rajesh. He informed his wife, Girija, that he was on some work in Hyderabad and had to stay in the city to complete it. Investigators suspect that he resorted to the extreme step by consuming the pesticide.

Speaking to The Hindu the victim’s brother Shravan said that Rao was a complete introvert who never opened his mind to them, not his jail mates when they were in judicial custody for eight months.

“Even when we were in prison, he used to sit alone and hardly interacted with anyone. Since childhood he had the same attitude,” Mr. Shravan said.

He dismissed rumours that they have property disputes, but nursed a grouse against his elder brother for falsely implicating him in the murder case though he had no connection. “Pranay was killed in September, but we have not been on talking terms since May. I spent eight months in jail for no fault of mine,” he said while waiting at Osmania General Hospital morgue to take Rao’s body to Miryalaguda after completion of the autopsy. Family members maintained that for the last three or four days, he was worried over the outcome of the case and was in search for a good advocate.

Meanwhile, Arya Vysya Bhavan’s receptionist P. Mallikarjun said that Rao was a frequent visitor, but after the murder, he visited for the first time. “He was a nice man. Never created an issue here.

187,2020/03/09,How Chennai’s Kannagi Nagar is turning into an art district,"Kannagi Nagar is now a canvas for artists from India and abroad. How is the community welcoming this initiative by St+art India?

Nila, a transgender artist from Chennai, walked along Kannagi Nagar wielding a megaphone a couple of weeks ago. She was surrounded by boisterous children, who put up notices around the many identical multi-storied apartments, as she made her announcements.

She was inviting residents to participate in an informal open mic on the empty grounds of Kannagi Nagar. Today, she is riding pillion on a bike that whizzes past the many colourful façades — again, megaphone in hand — announcing the festivities that are to unfurl in the evening; festivities that will officially mark Kannagi Nagar’s transformation into an art district.

Done in collaboration with Greater Chennai Corporation and Chennai Smart City Limited and Asian Paints, St+art India’s pet project, which identified one of Chennai’s most neglected rehabilitation neighbourhoods, is well on its way to completion. Sixteen façades feature the work of 16 national and international artists. But it is not just the walls that deserve attention: the many interventions that St+art has had with city-based NGOs and other collectives, in an attempt to engage with the community, bring more stories.

A resettlement area with a population of 80,000 people relocated from settlements for the disadvantaged and the river beds of Cooum, Adyar, and the Buckingham Canal, Kannagi Nagar is often associated with crime. And most reportage from this area have magnified only this aspect, according to Guilia Ambrogi, curator and co-founder of St+art India Foundation.

Standing against the lively background of a children’s volleyball game, she says, “If we do a Google search of Kannagi Nagar, we only see reports of crime, and problems of the past. There was a discrepancy and polarisation in what we found on media and what we felt on the ground. This is not to say that there is no crime, but definitely, it has become the only reading of the space, which is not right. There is a lively community here that many seem to ignore,” says Guilia.

She adds that many residents even find it difficult to acquire jobs owing to the space’s reputation. “ By changing the face of a space, we are also trying to activate it through positive consequences,” she says.

St+art initially considered Nochikuppam and Black Town, before zeroing in on Kannagi Nagar, mainly for its diversity.

This outlook is entrenched in the minds of the children here, as Madras Inherited found out through the project Kannagi Nagarin Kangal, where they approached four schools in the locality and interacted with students from Class V to VII. The children were given activity sheets with questions about their thoughts on Kannagi Nagar. The children’s uninhibited drawings showed gang wars, men wielding swords, water, and sewage problems. In fact, one of the posters read, ‘Kannagi Nagar naale fightu thaan.’ (If it’s Kannagi Nagar, it’s a fight).

By calling the area an art district and encouraging artistic interventions, St+art wishes to change this.

The murals magnify scenes that encapsulate the community. Viennese artist David Leitner’s untitled work featuring a woman who has joined her hands in prayer, and a family shown mid-move amidst a drought, draws attention to the community’s water crisis.

A combination of line drawings and paintings, the mural has these distinct parts. The arrangement of pots in the left bottom corner — some filled, some empty, some overflowing into others — signify multiple avenues for sharing. Further into the parallel streets, Bengaluru-based Aravani Art Project’s vibrant wall shows women sitting in a circle. This too, is a scene from community-driven, relaxed evenings that are part of Kannagi Nagar.

“Most of the walls we do are celebrations of the people who live in the area. And mostly, we depict trans women in the area. When we were walking around, we realised that the women and transwomen in Kannagi Nagar are very active. They sit around talking to each other, celebrating life, while doing their own thing — peeling vegetables for instance,” says Sadhna Prasad, art director of the collective.

A group of seven trans women who are part of the Aravali Art Project joined other artists to create the mural which also depicts the patterns, colours and faces that they had seen around. A part of the mural is left unfinished, inviting passers by to try their hand at painting.

The other side of the coin

A live graffiti jam is underway led by artist Zero from Delhi. Donning masks and spray paint cans, the group has been at the L-shaped walls for hours now.

Residents from the apartment opposite take their chairs out, to lounge and watch. Devika, who is preparing to write her Class X board exams seems elated: “I am not able to recognise my own street. Semma ya panranga! (They are doing it well),” she says. Her family was relocated from Thideer Nagar. She listens to her neighbour with fascination as he informs her that their “street has made an appearance even on YouTube.”

There is a sizeable number of people who are uncertain about how the project will help them on a personal level. “The streets have become colourful. But, beyond that, I don’t know how it is going to benefit us,” says a middle-aged woman who prefers to be anonymous. She, along with her family, sells toys and other miscellaneous items on a pull-cart.

But, many small vendors that line these streets are expecting to see more customers at least in the coming weeks. So much so that, an enterprising tea shop working out of one of the apartments, popped up days after work began.

Will this facelift work in residents’ favour? Only time will tell. If the space continues to be activated, it could become a public venue for other artists and their work, like Delhi’s Lodhi Art District’s collaboration with the latest edition of India Art Fair. But whether this makeover will lend to societal changes or awareness, and even if so, how long it will remain for, are factors that remain uncertain.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/jcnydf/article31023339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10MPART,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/stories-on-the-wall/article31023342.ece
188,2020/03/09,Restrictions on input tax credit challenged in HC,"‘Unreasonable, arbitrary conditions’

Restrictions imposed on the input tax credit, used by business establishments to reduce their tax liability, on inward supplies under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act have been challenged in the Rajasthan High Court with the plea that the amendment made to a rule to introduce the provision had imposed “unreasonable and arbitrary” conditions.

A Division Bench headed by Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty at the High Court’s principal seat in Jodhpur has issued notices to the Union government on the writ petition. The petitioner firm contended that the right to avail of credit could not be taken away by imposing the restrictions contained in the provisions of Section 43A of the Act, which was yet to be notified, through rules.

The amended Rule 36 (4) of the CGST Rules, 2017, provides that the input tax credit can be availed only when a supplier of goods updates and uploads online the details of supplies through each of the bills. The petitioner firm, Ravi Infrabuild, argued that the restrictions had been put on the basis of the acts of supplier, on which the recipient had no control.

Prior to the amendment, the tax regime provided that the difference would account for output tax liability. Petitioner’s counsel Vinay Kothari said that after the amendment, even a bona fide buyer had to chase the seller to upload and update his bills, failing which he would face the brunt.

‘Rights violated’

“The credit towards input has been capped to 20%, and now 10%, by way of the impugned amendment. Evidently, the amendment is totally arbitrary and violates constitutional and fundamental rights of business establishments,” Mr. Kothari said.

Section 43A of the CGST Act was introduced into the GST framework to simplify the procedures for filing of returns and availing the input tax credit. The impugned rule was amended even before Section 43A was notified, which the petitioner said had violated Article 14 (equality before law) of the Constitution.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/restrictions-on-input-tax-credit-challenged-in-hc/article31026330.ece
189,2020/03/09,Anti-CAA woman protester dies in Lucknow,"Farida died of cardiac arrest after getting drenched in rain and falling ill

A woman resident of old Lucknow, aged above 50, died of cardiac arrest after getting drenched in rain and falling ill while participating in an anti-CAA protest in the city’s Ghantaghar area, the office-bearer of an outfit spearheading the stir said on Monday.

Rihai Manch’s general secretary Rajiv Yadav said Farida died on Saturday.

“Farida got drenched in rains and was admitted to a city hospital after she fell ill. Despite her family asking her not to participate in the protest, till she gets medically fit, Farida wanted to participate in the protest again,” he said.

Last month too, a 20-year-old woman, Tayyaba, had died under similar circumstances, said Mr. Yadav.

Both women were residents of Old Lucknow, Mr. Yadav said, adding that the anti-CAA protest at Lucknow’s Ghantaghar had begun on January 17.

He also accused the police of not allowing protesters to put up a tent at the protest venue.

When contacted, Lucknow’s Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Naveen Arora said, “The protestors were not allowed to put up tents because they had not sought any permission for holding dharna.”

‘No permission’

“We never gave any permission for the protest or dharna, which is in gross violation of the prohibitory orders imposed in the city under Section 144 of the CrPC,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ru2w73/article31026323.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE10PG3-2-COLPTI1222020000190B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/anti-caa-woman-protester-dies-in-lucknow/article31026324.ece
190,2020/03/09,Protest against CAA in Ludhiana,"‘Stop attacks on people protesting against violation of rights’

Several members of over a dozen outfits — including farmers, labourers and students — on Monday staged a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) in Punjab’s Ludhiana.

‘Slogans against Centre’

At a gathering in the local grain market, the participants raised slogans against the BJP-led government at the Centre and demanded repealing of the CAA.

The leaders of different outfits demanded that all forms of attacks against the people protesting against violations of civil rights be stopped, their security be guaranteed, false cases against democratic protesters be cancelled, arrested people and intellectuals be released and strict action be taken against officers involved in attacks in JNU and Jamia Millia University. They also condemned the recent communal violence in Delhi.

Those who addressed the gathering included Joginder Singh Ugrahan, the president of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan); Manjeet Singh Dhaner, senior vice president of BKU (Ekta-Dakaunda); Rajwinder, president of Textile-Hosiery Workers’ Union; Maulana Md. Usman Ludhianavi, leader of Majlis Ahrar Islam Hind Jama Masjid among others.

‘Clear stand on NPR’

The leaders in a joint statement also demanded the Punjab government to clear its stand on NPR in writing, even as they cautioned the government against attempting to implement it.

191,2020/03/09,Akalis making a fool of themselves: CM,"‘Misleading people on jobs scenario’

A day after the Shiromani Akali Dal asked the ruling Congress government to come out clean on the issue of “unemployment”, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday hit back, saying the very premise of their criticism of his government’s employment generation programme was based on flawed data.

“The Akalis (SAD) were only making a fool of themselves with their repetitive attempts to mislead the people with half-baked lies that had absolutely no basis and were completely removed from facts,” Capt. Amarinder said in a statement issued here.

Even as he had once again put forward hard facts and figures to counter the ‘lies’ of SAD on the jobs created by his government in the past three years, the Chief Minister said they had clearly not bothered to understand or analyse the information in the economic survey, which they were using as the basis for attacking his government.

“The said economic survey released by the Union government clearly stated that the source of data provided on unemployment was the PLFS (Periodic Labour Force Survey) 2017-18 conducted by the Labour bureau, Government of India. The reference period therein was July 2017 to June 2018, which was barely a year since my government had inherited the mess created by the previous SAD-BJP government in the State,” said Capt. Amarinder.

The Chief Minister also pointed out that it had been mentioned in the survey itself by the Government of India that no comparison could be made with previous data on unemployment on the basis of this survey “as the data sources are not strictly comparable”. Clearly, then, there could be no comparison of the data of 2015-16 with the data of 2017-18, he added.

‘Creating troubles’

“These clear and categorical facts notwithstanding, the Akalis continue to rave and rant about the dismal employment scenario in Punjab, like wayward children who were hell-bent on creating trouble for others, mindless of the consequences,” Capt. Amarinder said.

“Instead of apologizing for pushing the State into such a terrible mess, with employment at an all-time low under their pathetic anti-people policies during their decade-long rule, the Akalis are trying to spread misinformation to further their petty political interests,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9x1rhf/article31026304.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE09-AMARINDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/akalis-making-a-fool-of-themselves-cm/article31026305.ece
192,2020/03/09,‘HC’s message to govt.: U.P. will be run by rule of law’,"Those named on Lucknow hoardings welcome order but say the damage is done and threat perception persists

Those featuring on the hoardings put up in Lucknow by the Uttar Pradesh government welcomed the Allahabad High Court's direction to get them removed but fear the episode exposing their identities in the public domain could yet jeopardise their safety. The government was yet to remove the hoardings till Monday evening or respond to the court’s observations terming it an unwanted interference in the privacy of people.

‘Damage beyond repair’

“The damage is done, which is beyond repair and long-term,” said Sadaf Jafar, Congress member and cultural activist, who is among the 57 persons whose names, photographs and residential address have been laid out on the banners across the city. They are accused, and most of them are out on bail, in the violence that took place in the State capital last December during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The banners ask them to pay for the damage to public and private property during the arson and vandalism within a stipulated time or have their properties seized by the district administration. The total damage listed in the hoardings amount to ₹1.55 crore.

“The HC order sends a very strong message across to the government that the State will be run by the rule of law and not by their authoritarianism,” said Ms. Jafar, a single mother of two.

“However, it does not bring permanent respite because the danger still lurks,” she said. “Now we are in the inboxes and galleries (of people's mobile phones),” she said.

Ms. Jafar feels that by putting up the banners, the State government “arraigned not just us but also our families”. “It puts their lives in danger. If people come looking for us, will they spare our family and property,” she asked

Theatre personality Deepak Kabir echoed similar concerns, arguing that the photos of the banners would stay forever in a digital world. He, however, felt the court ruling amounted to a “moral victory”. “This moral victory is very important for us at this stage because the way people and government build perception, the court has prevented that from happening on the basis of the Constitution,” he said.

Robin Verma, who teaches management at a local college, said the hoardings caused a big harm to his reputation and raised security concerns for his family. One such hoarding was put up right outside gate no. 1 of Lucknow University, he said.

“I stopped using public transport for security reasons [ever since the hoardings went up],” Mr. Verma said.

He also wondered how even removing the hoardings now could repair the damage done to his image.

Septuagenarian retired IPS officer S.R. Darapuri, who also features on the hoardings, said that by putting up them up in an “illegal way”, the BJP government had encroached upon his privacy, creating dangers for his life, property and freedom.

“It looks like the Yogi [Adityanath] sarkar is bent on getting us lynched by a mob,” he said.

Mr. Darapuri said he would approach court against the officers who put up the “illegal” hoardings.

Over three decades after 69 people were killed and 127 injured in a series of transistor bomb blasts across north India, a Delhi court has acquitted 30 of the 49 accused owing to ‘defective, lopsided, unfair’ and ‘faulty investigation’.

Additional sessions judge Sandeep Yadav said the investigation suffered from various lacunae and the accused could not be convicted in the 35-year-old case on the basis of evidence collected during such faulty investigation.

On the evening of May 10, 1985, bombs fitted in transistors went off in buses and other public places in Delhi and adjoining areas of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, killing 49 people and injuring 127 in Delhi alone.

A Special Investigation Team, under the supervision of then DCP (Central) of Delhi Police, had chargesheeted 59 accused. While five of the 59 are proclaimed offenders and never appeared to face proceedings, the trial court in July 2006 discharged five due to “insufficient evidence.”

194,2020/03/09,West Bengal tops list in sites contaminated by toxic substances,"CPCB data show a total of 324 sites affected in India, with 196 still awaiting confirmation

There are 128 sites in India contaminated by toxic and hazardous substances, according to a March update by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). West Bengal led the list with 27 sites followed by Odisha at 23. Including those, there are 324 sites that may be contaminated, with 196 still awaiting an investigation and confirmation.

The Union Environment Ministry has been monitoring — and has begun to commission clean-up jobs — at sites known to be contaminated.

Twenty sites in 6 States have seen agencies prepare a detailed project reports, or a plan of action, to clean up sites. Such action follows orders by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). There are four such sites in Kerala (Eloor-Edayar), Odisha (Ganjam, Orichem) Tamil Nadu (Ranipet), Uttar Pradesh (Rania, IPL and Deva Road), West Bengal (Nibra village), Madhya Pradesh (Ratlam).

Oil contamination

These incidents include oil contamination due to leakage of underground oil pipelines of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited in Tamil Nadu, pesticide and heavy metal contamination in creeks at Eloor, Kerala, chromium contamination at Rania, improperly disposed electronic waste lying on the banks of river Ramganga, Moradabad; mercury contamination of the soil at Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu, and Ganjam, Odisha, and chromium contamination at Ranipet, Tamil Nadu, and Lohianagar, Uttar Pradesh.

Poor record

Independent organisations have long warned that India has a poor track record in dealing with chemical accidents. According to ToxicsLink, an organisation that deals with hazardous waste disposal, there have been four major chemical accidents recorded, on average, every month between 2016-2019 and several accidents are not duly recorded.

195,2020/03/09,Madras High Court dismisses Madhya Pradesh’s plea on GI tag for basmati rice,"The State has challenged the exclusion of 13 districts from a map submitted by APEDA for the tag.

The State of Madhya Pradesh and the Madhya Shetra Basmati Growers Association have lost two separate cases filed by them in the Madras High Court in 2016 challenging the exclusion of 13 districts in the State from a map submitted by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) seeking Geographical Indication tag for basmati rice grown in the Indo Gangetic Plain.

Justices R. Subbiah and C. Saravanan dismissed both the writ petitions on the primary ground of maintainability after stating that the Geographical Indications Registry (GIR) had already issued GI tag certificates to APEDA by accepting its claim that basmatic rice was grown only in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Uttarakhand apart from 26 districts in Uttar Pradesh besides Jammu as well as Kathua.

The judges pointed out that after the filing of the present petitions in 2016, challenging an order passed by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) in Chennai, the GIR had passed an order on March 15, 2018 accepting APEDA’s application. Since two more writ petitions had been filed in 2018 challenging the grant of GI tag to APEDA and those cases were still pending, adjudication of present petitions had become merely academic, they added.

4 weeks’ suspension

However, after the pronouncement of the verdict, the judges suspended the operation of their order for a period of four weeks at the instance of the petitioners’ counsel who intended to take the judgment on appeal to the Supreme Court. The issue dates back to November 2008 when APEDA, a statutory body, filed an application before an Assistant Registrar of Geographical Indications in Chennai seeking GI tag for basmati rice.

In 2010, the State of Madhya Pradesh opposed APEDA’s application on the ground that the application had excluded the 13 districts of Morena, Bhind, Gwalior, Sheopur, Datia, Shivpuri, Guna,Vidisha, Raisen, Sehore, Hoshangabad, Jabalpur and Narsinghpur. The Assistant Registrar, in December 2013, directed APEDA to refile its application within 60 days along with a new map clearly demarcating the areas where basmati was actually cultivated.

Aggrieved over the Assistant Registrar’s decision, APEDA took the matter on appeal to IPAB which on February 5, 2016 directed the Geographical Indications Registry to issue a certification of registration to APEDA by accepting a map already submitted by it. In so far as the claim of Madhya Pradesh for inclusion of its 13 districts was concerned, the Board directed the Assistant Registrar to consider that issue afresh after hearing both sides.

2016 order

It was the February 2016 order of IPAB which had been challenged in the present writ petitions before the Bench led by Justice Subbiah. Even as these petitions were pending in the court for the last four years, the Assistant Registrar went ahead and registered the GI tag in favour of APEDA in March 2018 and the State of Madhya Pradesh as well as the Madhya Shetra Basmati Growers Association filed separate writ petitions challenging the registration.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/96tpt/article31026000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-BASMATI-rice,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/madras-high-court-dismisses-madhya-pradeshs-plea-on-gi-tag-for-basmati-rice/article31025985.ece

198,2020/03/09,Sonia to finalise Assam Opposition’s consensus RS candidate,"We’re wary of Himanta Biswa Sarma’s “horse-trading skills”, says AIUDF president Badrudddin Ajmal

Congress president Sonia Gandhi is expected to finalise the Assam Opposition’s consensus candidate for one of the three Rajya Sabha seats to be vacated in April.

Also Read AIUDF for Priyanka as consensus candidate

The Opposition Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) have shortlisted a few names.

“We want a vocal, articulate person who has a secular outlook and is against the unconstitutional Citizenship (Amendment) Act and who can highlight the critical issues of the State in Parliament. We are hopeful of naming our candidate in two-three days,” AIUDF president and perfume baron Maulana Badrudddin Ajmal said on Monday.

He said the two parties were wary of Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his “horse-trading skills”.

Mr. Ajmal, who represents western Assam’s Dhubri constituency in the Lok Sabha, had founded the AIUDF in 2005 as a reaction to the “inability of the Congress government” in the State and at the Centre to prevent the scrapping of the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act of 1983.

The Supreme Court scrapped the allegedly pro-immigrants Act on the basis of a petition by Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who was then with the Asom Gana Parishad, one of the two regional allies in the BJP-led government he heads now.

“We have narrowed down the list of probable candidates to be approved by Sonia Gandhiji soon,” a senior party leader said, declining to be quoted.

Congress stalwart and former Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said tying up with the AIUDF — the party he once said was incompatible — has become a necessity for keeping the “fascist, communal forces” in check. He said a few people, including media house owner Jayanta Baruah, were seeking a berth.

Mr. Baruah denied approaching either of the two parties, as did film-maker Jahnu Barua who said he had no political ambitions. The former said his name crops up whenever there is an election to the Rajya Sabha.

A possible consensus candidate is journalist Ajit Kumar Bhuyan, who leaders of the two parties said could win the race.

The 126-member Assam Assembly has an effective strength of 124 following the death of Congress MLA Pranab Kumar Gogoi and BJP’s Rajen Barthakur. With 86 legislators, the BJP and its allies are confident of winning two of the three seats to be vacated by Bhubaneswar Kalita, Sanjay Sinh and Biswajit Daimary in April.

Both Mr. Kalita and Dr. Sinh quit the Congress and joined the BJP last year while Mr. Daimary belongs to the Bodoland People’s Front, one of the BJP’s two regional allies.

The BJP has chosen Mr. Kalita while Mr. Daimary is likely to be renominated for the second seat.

The Congress with 23 MLAs and the AIUDF with 14 can bag the third seat only if they field a consensus candidate and there is no cross-voting.

200,2020/03/09,Allahabad High Court orders removal of controversial ‘name and shame’ hoardings,"'No powers for Police or Executive to display personal records of a person to public at large'

Allahabad High Court on Monday directed the Lucknow administration to remove forthwith the controversial ‘name and shame’ hoardings of those arrested during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

“In entirety, we are having no doubt that the action of the State, which is subject matter of this public interest litigation is nothing but an unwarranted interference in privacy of people. The same hence, is in violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” a Division Bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Ramesh Sinha said.

The Bench also asked the District Magistrate of Lucknow to submit a report on the action taken by March 16.

Rejecting the State's arguments against the Court taking the case suo motu, the Bench said , ""where there is gross negligence on part of public authorities and government, where the law is disobeyed and the public is put to suffering and where the precious values of the constitution are subjected to injuries, a constitutional court can very well take notice of that at its own.""

The court further observed that the placement of personal data of selected persons ""reflects colorable exercise of powers"" by the government.

""Advocate General failed to satisfy us as to why the personal data of few persons have been placed on banners though in the State of Uttar Pradesh [when] there are lakhs of accused persons who are facing serious allegations pertaining to commission of crimes whose personal details have not been subjected to publicity,"" the High Court said in its 14-page order.

'Accused are not fugitive'

Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the power is available to a Court to publish a written proclamation requiring appearance of persons against whom a warrant has been issued and such person is concealing himself to avoid execution of warrant, the court said. No other power is available in the Code to police or the Executive to display personal records of a person to public at large, it stated.

""There are certain provisions empowering the investigating agencies or other Executives to take picture of accused for the purpose of their identification and record but that too is not open for publication. The only time these photographs be published is to have assistance in the apprehension of a fugitive from justice,"" said the court.

Commenting on the legality of the hoardings, the court said ,""no law is in existence permitting the State to place the banners with personal data of the accused from whom compensation is to be charged."" The accused persons are the accused from whom some compensation is to be recovered and in no manner they are fugitive, it said.

In a controversial move, the police and the administration put up several hoardings in Lucknow identifying those accused of violence during the protests against the CAA in December last, triggering fears among those named. The names, photographs and residential addresses of the accused are listed in the hoardings.

They have been asked to pay for the damage to public and private property within a stipulated time or have their properties seized by the district administration. The total damage listed in the hoardings amounts to ₹1.55 crore. As many as 57 persons have been identified in the hoardings.

One of them, with 28 names, put up at the Hazratganj intersection, next to the statue of B.R. Ambedkar, asks them to pay up over Rs. 64 lakh.

In a rare Sunday sitting, the Allahabad High Court pulled up the Uttar Pradesh government for the controversial hoardings. The Division Bench had taken up the matter suo motu.

Uttar Pradesh Advocate General Raghvendra Singh while accepting absence of any statute permitting executive authorities to put such banners, had opposed the petition by submitting that the object of displaying personal details of the individuals ""is to deter the mischief mongers from causing damage to public and private property.""

The State had also questioned the territorial jurisdiction of the court in Allahabad and argued that the court ""erred in invoking public interest jurisdiction in the instant matter, that being available to under privileged section of the society only."" The persons whose personal details are given in the banners are capable enough to agitate their grievance, if any, at their own, the State told the court.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/m79z6j/article30998200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bannerjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/allahabad-high-court-orders-removal-of-controversial-name-and-shame-hoardings/article31022409.ece

206,2020/03/09,Arunachal editor awaits justice 9 years after murder attempt,"Police chief says a probe ordered into alleged loss of evidence

A senior journalist in Arunachal Pradesh, who was shot at by a gunman outside her office in the capital Itanagar almost nine years ago, has found out that the material evidence and case records are “untraceable”.

It took a long time for Tongam Rina, the associate editor of The Arunachal Times, to recover from a bullet, fired point blank, that damaged her spine. The murder attempt on July 15, 2012, was made two months after her office was vandalised following reports in the daily on the PDS scam and shady hydro-power deals.

She has been fighting two cases since — one of the attack on the newspaper’s office at the court of the Judicial Magistrate First Class and the other related to the murder attempt at the court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate. The two courts are in the same complex and share the storage for all documents.

Appearing for a hearing in the office attack case on March 2, Ms Tongam discovered that the CCTV footage of the attack and damaged computers kept at the local police station’s storeroom had gone missing. “The police said the evidence had been submitted to the court. The court latter said it had no records. It is time the judiciary, the police and the State government came up with answers — answers I have been denied for so long,” she said.

The case record related to the bid on her too has been stuck in the court. “I want to know what is happening in the case, who tried to kill me. I have virtually lost faith in the police, should I in the judiciary now?” Ms. Tongam said.

Director-General of Police Rajendra Pal Upadhyaya said an inquiry had been instituted into the alleged loss of evidence. “The inquiry will be conducted by Mari Riba, the Deputy Inspector-General (Intelligence),” he told The Hindu.

Issuing an appeal on International Women’s Day, the Arunachal Pradesh Women Welfare Society said the police need to properly investigate the missing video footage, a crucial piece of evidence. “We are deeply pained and concerned for the safety and security of Tongam Rina. Justice delayed should not end up as justice denied,” it said in a statement.

The Arunachal Pradesh Union of Working Journalists and the Network of Women in Media, India, said Ms. Tongam’s case was a grave lapse on the part of the law-enforcement system and did not bode well for the pursuit of justice.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/c7lbq2/article31018568.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tongam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/arunachal-editor-awaits-justice-9-years-after-murder-attempt/article31018569.ece

208,2020/03/09,Women’s Day event in Odisha honors former female maoists,"Fifteen former female Maoists, who had surrendered in the past, were invited with their family

The police in Odisha’s Malkangiri district celebrated the Women’s Day through a special ceremony that included the surrender of a female Maoist cadre from Chhattisgarh and honouring of 15 former women Maoists from the district, who had surrendered in the past.

At the event, held at the district police headquarter on Sunday, Debe Sodi, 22, a Maoist having ₹4 lakh rupees reward on her head, surrendered before the Malkangiri Superintendent of Police (SP) Rishikesh Dnyandeo Khilari. Sodi hailed from Kusaraj village of Sukma district in Chhattisgarh and was an area committee member of Katakalyan area committee under Darva division of Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee of the outlawed CPI (Maoist) organisation.

Fifteen former female Maoists, who had surrendered in the past, were invited with their family.

According to Mr. Khilari, these women were also provided free medical check up for breast and cervical cancer at the Malkangiri district headquarter hospital.

Ms. Sodi had joined the Maoist organisation in 2012. She was involved in several incidents of violence, including exchanges of fire with security personnel in Malkangiri and Chhattisgarh, and at least two murders in Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh.

According to her, gender discrimination in the Maoist organisation as well as physical and mental harassment faced by female cadre at the hands of naxalite leaders was a major reason behind her surrender. She was also impressed by developmental activities taken up by the Odisha government in the remote areas of the Tulsi reserve forest. Increased area dominance and security penetration also pushed her to leave the Maoist organisation.

Ms. Sodi will be rehabilitated as per the surrender and rehabilitation scheme of the Odisha government. She will also get financial assistance to build her own house, pursue studies and get trained in some vocation of her choice.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/womens-day-event-in-odisha-honors-former-female-maoists/article31018268.ece

211,2020/03/09,Former Minister and PDP leader Bukhari floats a party,"J&K Apni Party not to seek special status for Union Territory

Businessman-turned-politician and former Minister Altaf Bukhari, 60, on Sunday floated the J&K Apni Party (JKAP) as an alternative to the regional parties such as the National Conference (NC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), of which he was once a member .

The JKAP becomes the first Valley-based regional party since 1947 that stands for integration of Jammu and Kashmir into the Union of India and that is against any special status or autonomy for the Union Territory, in contrast to the NC’s pre-1953 position, the PDP’s ‘self-rule’ and Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference’s ‘Achievable Nationhood’.

“We’re not here to sell dreams and fantasies but will always be pragmatic, honest and fair in our approach,” Mr. Bukhari said.

“We have resolved to create a platform where people are the real stakeholders of the political process,” said Mr. Bukhari, who hit the political scene in 2014 by joining the PDP and was the richest candidate with assets worth ₹84 crore in the Assembly election.

On Article 370, which was diluted on August 5 last year, Mr. Bukhari said, “It is now in the domain of the judiciary. We will wait for the verdict of the Supreme Court.” However, his party’s main plank would be restoration of statehood and domicile rights to land and employment.

The party has decided not to seek reunification of the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh into one State. It has taken no members from Ladakh and confined itself to Jammu and Kashmir. “The party will seek to preserve the identity and dignity of the people of J&K, the dignified return of Kashmiri Pandits, empowerment of youth and women,” he said.

Mr. Bukhari accused the PDP and the NC of “staying silent” after the special status of Jammu and Kashmir was revoked.

Except for PDP patron Muzaffar Hussian Baig, Mr. Bukhari has roped in most of former PDP legislators and Ministers, at least 12.

Sources said Mr. Bukhari and Mr. Baig were in touch, but failed to reach an agreement on who will head the new party. However, Mr. Baig’s brother Javid Baig did join Mr. Bukhari's party. Five former legislators of the Congress and one of the NC from Jammu are among the 40 leaders who joined the party.

The floating of the party is likely to push for resumption of the political process, which came to a halt after August 5, 2019, with the detention of most of the local leaders.

The latest development comes at a time when regional political bigwigs, NC's Dr. Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah, PDP's Mehbooba Mufti and Naeem Akhtar, JKPC's Sajad Lone and JKPM chief Shah Faesal remain behind the bars.

The party is likely to divide Kashmir-based electorate in the next elections, favouring the BJP which plans to have a Hindu chief minister in J&K.

Congress irked

The Congress termed the new party an “offshoot of the saffron party”. “It’s hell bent on creating chaos and divisions in the political system. The motive behind the new party would be visible on the ground very soon,” J&K Congress president G.A. Mir said.

Jamu and Kashmir Panthers Party chief Harsh Dev Singh said, “Several Jammu-based leaders have decided to support the Kashmiri leadership despite having vowed umpteen times to liberate the people of Jammu from Kashmir’s hegemony. The political atmosphere of Jammu and Kashmir is being made toxic by defectors. It’s a Himalayan blunder.”

PDP leader Firdous Tak said, “For the PDP, the loss is visible.

212,2020/03/09,Veteran dancer-choreographer Astad Deboo says much more can be done to present dance shows,"Elegant vocabulary

He is a picture of grace and elegance. His agility belies his 70 years. Astad Deboo is in his 50th year of his career as a professional dancer-choreographer, and he shows no signs of tiring. The veteran was in Bengaluru recently for a performance of Same Same But Different, a concert series initiated by Korean-based music ensemble Noreum Machi, presented by InKo Centre, in association with The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Republic of Korea and Arts Council Korea, at Jagriti Theatre.

In a free-wheeling chat Astad talked about his performance and his journey as a performer.

“My work is three pieces, one with the Carnatic musicians, the second with Korean musicians and the third with the entire Korean and Indian ensemble.”

Astad, however, says that presenting his shows aren’t easy despite being a recognised figure. “Performance platforms have been few and far between. I have to produce shows myself because the presenters offer a ridiculous price.”

However, there is no stopping Astad. He has evolved a style of his own, which he describes as a contemporary vocabulary with a traditional twist.

“I am trained in Indian classical dance, first in Kathak and then in Kathakali. Then I went abroad to study modern dance. I spent a lot of time in Japan and Indonesia. All these influences are embodied in my work, and through the years I have evolved as a performer to create my own vocabulary, which is minimal and controlled. You will see that it is still an Indian body performing. I do bring in elements of my Indian classical tradition, it is not like all the work will have either Kathak or Kathakali, sometimes there are just traces, which is again to see how the body performs and responds.”

Even though Astad has not founded any school, he has created a body of work with the youth, having worked with street children and the hearing impaired for years. “In 2007, I was asked by Salaam Baalak Trust to create a work with street children, so I created Breaking Boundaries. Two years ago I was asked by the Wildlife Trust of India to create a work on saving the elephant, so I picked up some of the students (who I worked with for Salaam Baalak Trust). I have been mentoring them. As and when the opportunity arises I call upon them. Some of them have become professionals. I have brought them on board in my most recent work Unbroken Unbound, celebrating Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary.”

Astad says he has been working with the hearing impaired for the last 30 years. “The first group was in Kolkata, the second in Chennai and now I am working with a group in Mumbai and I have also been involved with Gallaudet University in Washington DC for some years.”

Astad says he sees himself as a catalyst in bringing forward talent from these young performers.

“I have worked in Manipur for 14 years. I first started working with the thang ta (Manipuri martial arts) and now with the Pung Cholom drummers so that is another contribution of bringing the traditional Manipuri performing disciplines into my works.” He dismisses any claim that he can pick up any style of dance.

“There are many styles and it is physically not possible to pick up all of them. The style which I have studied is what my body responded to. I started at the age of six, I went overseas at the age of 21, and when I was there I started taking classes and saw that you focus on a particular style to see if you can respond to that particular style.

“There are these young dancers who say they contemporary dancers. When asked what have you studied? They say ballet, jazz etc...that is not possible. “They have probably taken a workshop or seen a video and then say they have studied that. It is half-baked. With Indian traditional dance styles, we spend years before we have an arangetram. So similarly I spent a good 10 years studying Kathak and another six years studying Kathakali, not to be a Kathakali dancer but just to have that vocabulary in my body, which I call upon as and when I choose to choreograph my work.”

As to the secret to his passion for dance, Astad says: “I am blessed that I am still able to dance, whatever I present my audience appreciate and receive it positively. I am still motivated to work and dance.”",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/t47xdc/article31022301.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGMASTADDEBOO1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/elegant-vocabulary/article31022303.ece
213,2020/03/09,Sweeping changes at the Coimbatore Corporation,"Post graduates, graduates among those appointed conservancy workers

When 23-year-old K. Sangeetha picked up a broom to sweep Raja Street on Monday morning she was going through mixed emotions.

It was the first day of her job as a Coimbatore Corporation conservancy worker and she was not quite prepared for the task that awaited her. “I did not expect the sweep the road. Initially it was very difficult. I felt as if all eyes were on me. But I managed to pull through.”

Despite holding a post-graduate qualification in microbiology, she took up the appointment because she always wanted a government job.

“I convinced myself — let me take it, for life does not have to end with me being a conservancy worker. I'll use this as a stepping stone to find better avenues.”

As she continued sweeping, she felt better. “I started seeing the work as volunteering done by NSS volunteers,” she says and adds that when she completed the task and turned back to see the clean Raja Street “I felt happy.”

For 35-year-old N. Padmavathy too, Monday was the first day of work as a municipal conservancy worker. She also took up the assignment because it was a government job and the salary was better than that at her last employer.

The conservancy workers on entry get a little more than ₹17,500 a month. They are eligible for annual increments and pension benefits.

The working hours were another reason for Ms Padmavathy quitting her job as an accountant at a private firm near Town Hall.

“Here I'm happy that I can finish my work early in the evening to return home to my children,” says the mother of two.

The women are among dozens of men and women with under-graduate and post-graduate qualifications who applied for and were appointed for conservancy work. The new staff include those from the Backward Classes and Most Backward Classes.

R. Naveen, a civil engineering diploma holder, says family circumstances forced him to take up the job. “I’m the breadwinner and support my mother and younger sister. That is why I left my job at a private company to take this government job.”

On his first day, he went around his assigned area to educate people on waste segregation and that made him feel good.

For Narayanan (name changed on request) the failure to crack other competitive examinations made him take up this job. He has a Masters in Commerce and 13 years’ experience in a private company.

Mr. Naveen and Mr. Narayanan say they are in a way happy because they are breaking the stereotype equating conservancy work with a particular community.

Welcoming the fact that qualified candidates and persons from outside the SC communities were taking up conservancy work, S. Selvakumar, Member, State Level SC Welfare Committee, said it was a step towards ensuring social equality.

But, such people should not use this as a stepping stone to gain their way to other posts in the Corporation like office assistants as, making a mockery of the system.

A senior Corporation official said the civic body followed the roster system in appointing qualified candidates but did not share details on the exact number of appointees with a college qualification.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/2dzix1/article31025994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Honey-conservancy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/sweeping-changes-at-the-coimbatore-corporation/article31025995.ece
214,2020/03/09,Farmers stage protest against proposed IDPL project,"Urge authorities concerned to lay pipeline on road sides instead of farm lands

Farmers from Salem and neighbouring districts staged a protest here on Monday against the Bharat Petroleum’s proposed Irugur- Devanagonthi Pipeline(IDPL) project. The protesters later handed over petitions to revenue authorities.

Hundreds of farmers from Salem, Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode, Namakkal, Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri gathered on Omalur main road and raised slogans opposing the pipeline project between Irugur in Coimbatore and Devanagonthi in Karnataka through farm lands.

The farmers demanded that the pipeline should be taken on road sides and agricultural lands must not be affected. Farmers said that they would be severely affected by the project and livelihood of many would be affected.

They said that the pipeline would be laid for over 300 km. through the seven districts and over 6,000 farmers would be affected if the pipeline is laid through farm lands. They said that according to Petroleum and Minerals Pipeline Act, the land owner or farmer would be held responsible if any damage occurs to the pipeline for no fault of them.

The farmers complained that if the pipeline is laid through farm lands, banks many not offer loans over the property. The protesters also condemned State government for not opposing the proposed project.

State secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam P. Shanmugham said that agriculture lands is already being acquired for expansion of roads and laying high tension towers and this would further affect farmers. “ Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa ordered laying GAIL pipeline on road sides after farmers protests. Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswamishould consider our grievances and take necessary steps to lay the pipeline along roadsides instead of taking it through farm lands”, he said.

Though senior police officials tried to pacify the protesters, they did not budge. They dispersed only after respective revenue authorities collected their petitions individually.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/rj3ty5/article31025905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA10FARMERSPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/farmers-stage-protest-against-proposed-idpl-project/article31025906.ece
215,2020/03/09,Forest department conducts joint patrolling to check unauthorised electric fencing,"‘Action will be taken against farm owners found installing electric fence without persmission’

The forest department along with officials from Tamil Nadu Electricity Board conducted joint patrolling in forest areas in Mettur forest range to check unauthorised electric fencing.

The Mettur range shares its borders with Erode forest ranges and it is closest with the Western Ghats. According to forest department officials, recently incidents of straying animals like elephants from other ranges have been reported here and the patrolling is being done to prevent electrocution of animals that might stray out of forest areas during summer in search of water and food.

Recently, a 40-year-old elephant from Erode forest ranges was electrocuted near Kolathur when the animal tried to venture into a corn field. According to forest department officials, a case was registered against the land owners for setting up electric fencing without permission.

Another tusker strayed into a village near Kolathur here and attacked a cow.

Following such incidents, forest department officials have been conducting regular patrolling in Mettur range along with electricity department officials and fencing in farm lands are checked. Officials said that they check whether permission has been given for setting up electric fencing and whether permitted voltage of power is passed through it. Forest department officials also said that necessary water arrangements have also been made in the range.

District Forest Officer A .Periasamy said, “the officers are patrolling regularly and if any of farm owners are found installing electric fencing without permission or passing high voltage, then electricity department officials are alerted and they take further action.”",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/utcerp/article31025894.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA10PATROLLING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/forest-department-conducts-joint-patrolling-to-check-unauthorised-electric-fencing/article31025895.ece
216,2020/03/09,Srinath Gowtham and Vinoth Kumar teach the basics of natural dyeing at a workshop called Varna in Coimbatore,"Srinath Gowtham and Vinoth Kumar gave a step-by step demo on natural dyeing and how there is beauty in colours originating in Nature

My hands have turned red from the dried manjistha root. I am at Varna, a workshop conducted by Srinath Gowtham and Vinoth Kumar, founders of Bhutha Earthen Architecture Studio at Rathinam School of Architecture. “It is an honour to have these colours on one’s hands. It shows that you have created something beautiful,” Srinath assures me.

Natural dyeing has been practised from time immemorial and and people used locally available materials.“For example, in India, we used turmeric, indigo, manjistha and pomegranate peel,” Vinoth points out.

Participants at the workshop are shown how simple and uncomplicated the process of natural dyeing is. “Wash the fabric to remove the starch,” begins Vinoth. “The colours won’t stick otherwise,” he explains. The fabric is then treated with rock salt or alum dissolved in boiling water.

Similarly the raw materials like the yellow marigold, red rose, dried manjistha root, powdered kadukkai seeds and indigo powder are separately added to pots of boiling water. “The colour tone of the fabric depends on the amount of materials you use. “More the raw materials, deeper the shade,” explains Srinath adding it is up to the user’s discretion as to how much he or she wants to use. The water in which the natural materials have been boiled is now coloured and it is filtered after which the fabric is soaked in it for at least half an hour. The cloth dyed with the red roses appears purple. Marigold lends its bright yellow hue while the kadukkai seeds turn the cloth green.

Vinoth and Srinath worked in Auroville for four years after their college. “It was there that we were introduced to a sustainable lifestyle. We started to eat organic food and wear organic clothes,” Vinoth says. “We travelled and met many local communities in Rajasthan that practised natural dyeing. We met an old man with a small unit near the Thar desert. We watched him dyeing with indigo. He also allowed us to try it on a piece of cloth,” Srinath says. The man also explained how natural dyeing was sustainable. The raw materials used in would decompose and the chemical-free water could go back to the soil.

Committed as they are about natural dyes, they admit that there are challenges. “The colours might bleed in the first two washes and sooner or later, they begin to fade,” says Vinoth. But, he smiles, “While it is labour intensive and time consuming, these are small hardships that we can endure to protect mother Nature.”",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/hoq3nx/article31021625.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WORKSHOP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/srinath-gowtham-and-vinoth-kumar-teach-the-basics-of-natural-dyeing-at-a-workshop-called-varna-in-coimbatore/article31021628.ece

222,2020/03/09,Pvt. women’s hostels come under scanner,"Out of 273 hostels in the district, only 120 have been registered with Dept. of Social Welfare

Amidst concerns of safety in private women's hostel, the district administration has recently issued a warning to unregistered private women's hostels in Coimbatore district.

District Collector K. Rajamani said on March 4 that all private women's hostels must be registered with the Department of Social Welfare under the Tamil Nadu Hostels and Homes for Women and Children (Regulation) Act, 2014. In a release, he warned that owners of unregistered hostels might face a jail term of up to two years and a fine of ₹50,000.

Mr. Rajamani told The Hindu that out of 273 women's hostels in the district, only 120 have registered with the Department of Social Welfare and 53 remain unregistered. The other 100 hostels are in various stages of registration, he said. Among the regular complaints received are sanitation issues, lack of adequate space and irregular water supply, Mr. Rajamani said.

With working women and college students predominantly staying in these hostels, issues of safety continue to remain a concern. On February 28, Saravanampatti police arrested three men who dressed up as policemen and entered a women's hostel in Chinnavedampatti under the pretence of inspection. Upon entering the hostel, the gang 'confiscated' the mobile phones and absconded from the spot. Conceding that a few hostels have petitioned the district administration regarding lack of security guards in the night, Mr. Rajamani said, “We have asked the police to patrol those areas in the night on alternate days.”

District Social Welfare Officer P. Thangamani said that a majority of the 53 unregistered women's hostels across the district are in the city. The private hostels must obtain sanitary certificates, fire safety certificates and stability certificates, which must be renewed annually. The Department of Social Welfare will issue show-cause notices during its inspections in those hostels that have not renewed these certificates, Ms. Thangamani said.

However, Ms. Thangamani pointed out the 53 unregistered hostels could not be inspected in a short time frame because of staff shortage at the Department of Social Welfare. “We have works related to (State) government schemes,” she said. Despite this, Ms. Thangamani said that the officials are expected to finish inspecting the unregistered hostel premises by April.

A. Radhika, district secretary of All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA), urged the district administration to survey the total number of women living in private hostels. “There must be at least two lakh women living in hostels in Coimbatore district,” she claimed. Most of the women's hostels are located in Saravanampatti, Peelamedu and Eachanari as various educational institutions and corporate offices are located in those areas, Ms. Radhika said. With Coimbatore being a hub for higher education and employment, women from other States live in private hostels and their safety must be ensured in the city, she said.

In 2018, a women's hostel at Hope College came under fire after some of the inmates complained of sexual harassment by the hostel owner. However, no major complaints of sexual harassment in private hostels have been confirmed by the district administration since then, Ms. Thangamani said

Mr. Rajamani said that he will convene a meeting with all the hostel owners and representatives of private hostels from the district soon. “We will communicate the expectations of the district administration in the meeting,” he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/pvt-womens-hostels-come-under-scanner/article31017586.ece
223,2020/03/09,MLA alleges poor water supply; Corporation refutes claim,"Ahead of Summer 2020, the war of words between the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam MLA N. Karthik and the Coimbatore Corporation seems to have intensified, as the former has fired a fresh salvo accusing the civic body of poor water supply.

Mr. Karthik says that supply of water from borewells for non-potable purposes is poor as the persons tasked with regulating the water supply are proxies of former AIADMK councillors or those close to the ruling party. The persons who take on contract the water distribution not only poorly regulate water supply but also claim money by submitting bogus bills – that is claim maintenance for borewells that are in disuse. At over ₹ 2,000 a month a borewell as maintenance, this works out to crores of rupees a year for the city, he charges.

Denying the allegation, Coimbatore Corporation engineers say, before countering the allegations, the civic body likes to inform the city’s residents that there is unlikely to be any shortage of ground water, as the moonsoon rains were good last year, resulting in recharge of ground water.

This year none of the field engineers has submitted demands for digging fresh borewells – something that they usually do around this time of the year to make up for defunct borewells to improve ground water supply.

The new borewell claims that the civic body is processing are that of last year and this only underscores the fact that yield from ground water has been good.

That the proxies of ruling party or councillors take on contract the maintenance of borewells and water supply is not unique to the AIADMK , the engineers say.

Until a few years ago, the Corporation was perfunctorily clearing the bills the contractors presented. After 2014, the Corporation asks the contractors to also furnish details of the power consumed by motors attached to each of the borewells under their maintenance to ensure that it does not clear bogus claims for defunct borewells.

It is now a routine in the Corporation that contractors of all the 2,000-odd borewells do so, the engineers point out. The engineers, however, say that there is one problem that the senior Corporation officials look into: the issue of replacing motors or adding new pipes to reach underground water. Given the ₹ 2,574 a borewell a month the Corporation gives, the contractors are reluctant to either repair the motors or add more pipelines or take up other maintenance work.

Without looking into such issues for fear of incurring expenditure, they declare that such borewells are defunct as water yield is negligible. To overcome the problem, the Corporation should give the contracts not ward-wise but zone-wise.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ehmxz1/article31017551.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB09-TANKK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/mla-alleges-poor-water-supply-corporation-refutes-claim/article31017552.ece

226,2020/03/09,Doctors’ forum dispels beliefs on commercial cord blood banking,"People warned against tactics of stem cell banking companies

Poona Citizen Doctor Forum (PCDF), a body that aims to rebuild trust among citizens and doctors, and promote ethical rational medical practice, has come forward to bust the aggressively promoted concept of cord blood banking.

In a video released by the forum, gynaecologist and activist Dr. Arun Gadre warns to-be parents against falling prey to the emotional marketing tactics by stem cell banking companies.

“Over the past decade, stem cell banking has been aggressively marketed even as its use is still in experimental stages. But these companies charge enormous fees from parents to preserve cells,” said Dr. Gadre, adding it is merely by emotional marketing that companies convince parents to bank the cells for several years promising future therapeutic use.

Cord blood banking involves taking the umbilical cord blood, which is a rich source of stem cells, and preserving it for future use. Private companies who have forayed into this field offer packages anywhere between ₹50,000 and ₹1 lakh to store and preserve the cells in right conditions.

However, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) does not recommend commercial stem cell banking. It says so far there is no scientific basis for preservation of cord blood for future self use and this practice therefore raises ethical and social concerns. “Private storage of the cord blood is advisable when there is an elder child in the family with a condition treatable with these cells and the mother is expecting the next baby. In other situations, parents should be educated about the limitations of banking at this point of time.”

Despite such guidelines, a nexus of doctors and stem cell banking companies thrives and these companies get access to data of to-be parents. Activists say stem cell banking companies start approaching their prospective customers much before the delivery and offer competitive packages.

“Globally, cord blood banking is recommended as a source of hematopoietic stem cell (derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood) transplantation for haematological cancers and disorders where its use is recommended. For all other conditions, the use of cord blood as a source of stem cells is not yet established,” ICMR’s deputy director general Dr. Geeta Jotwani said.",states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/bba0af/article31018660.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9BmStem-Cellcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/doctors-forum-dispels-beliefs-on-commercial-cord-blood-banking/article31018528.ece
227,2020/03/09,Rift within VBA as 2 former Akola MLAs set to join NCP,"Duo along with 45 office-bearers quits party, blames Ambedkar’s ‘dictatorial style’

In a setback to the Prakash Ambedkar-led Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), former MLA and VBA leader from Akola, Haridas Bhade, held talks with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday.

Mr. Bhade along with another former MLA Baliram Sirskar and 45 VBA office-bearers submitted their resignations to Mr. Ambedkar last month. He attributed their exit to Mr. Ambedkar’s allegedly ‘dictatorial style’ of functioning within the party.

Sharad Pawar

However, sources said Mr. Bhade had been miffed after he was denied a ticket by Mr. Ambedkar in the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly election.

While he was expected to formally enter the NCP fold in Mumbai on Sunday, Mr. Bhade said he would take a final call on his joining Mr. Pawar’s party in a week’s time. “We held fruitful discussions with Mr. Pawar on Sunday. More than 100 VBA office-bearers from across Maharashtra, including some from the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), are keen to join the NCP. However, our condition is that we should be given responsible positions,” Mr. Bhade told The Hindu from Mumbai.

Mr. Bhade, said to be an influential Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh or BBM (the former name of the VBA) leader in Akola, had bagged the Akola East Assembly seat in the 2009 Assembly poll, defeating his nearest rival, the Shiv Sena’s Gulabrao Gawande, by a margin of nearly 14,000 votes. However, he lost his seat in the 2014 election to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Randhir Savarkar by a slender margin of less than 2,000 votes.

Mr. Sirskar, another important leader in the erstwhile BBM, is a former two-time MLA from the Balapur Assembly segment in Akola.

Akola has been a stronghold of Mr. Ambedkar’s party with Mr. Ambedkar himself being elected twice as MP from the Akola Lok Sabha constituency.

“Despite the exit of these former VBA legislators, it remains to be seen just how much damage they can do to Mr. Ambedkar’s party. After all, both Mr. Bhade and Mr. Sirskar were elected because of Mr. Ambedkar’s pull in the region,” a Mumbai-based political analyst said.

The latest exits of VBA leaders is indicative of the friction prevailing within Mr. Ambedkar’s party following the Assembly election last year.

The VBA’s alliance with the Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM had queered the pitch for the Congress and the NCP in at least 10 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats during the 2019 general elections by eating into the traditional Dalit vote bank of the two parties.

However, following the Lok Sabha polls, the VBA-AIMIM alliance was split wide open following bickering over seat sharing before the Assembly election last October.

The AIMIM had alleged that Mr. Ambedkar was only willing to leave a paltry eight of the 288 seats for it to contest, while the VBA would fight on the remaining 280.

Since the crumbling of the alliance, the VBA has emerged as a somewhat disoriented party, having lost the initiative that Mr. Ambedkar had seized following the 2018 Bhima-Koregaon clashes, which led to a significant proportion of the Ambedkarite community gravitating towards the VBA.",states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/h0eke5/article31018485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BMPRAKASHAMBEDKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/rift-within-vba-as-2-former-akola-mlas-set-to-join-ncp/article31018390.ece
228,2020/03/09,Faf’s experience will come in handy: Boucher,"Proteas’ tour begins on February 12

Former skipper Faf du Plessis’ long experience of playing the IPL and international cricket in India will come in handy during the upcoming three-match ODI series, says South Africa head coach Mark Boucher.

The series starts in Dharamsala on February 12.

“If you go to a place like India, you need to find a balance between youth and experience. I think Faf is really doing well in ODI cricket. The last time he played, he got a hundred. He knows the Indian conditions very well,” Boucher said at the team’s pre-departure press conference on Sunday.

The South African team reached India on Monday morning and will take a chartered flight to Dharamsala on Tuesday. Boucher feels that having du Plessis also means he will have some selection headaches, which is a good thing to have.

“It’s a good headache to have. Just him being around the squad will add a lot of value and experience. We will look at conditions and then put together combinations. Why you would want to have Faf is because he has done really well in those (Indian) conditions,” Boucher said.

While South Africa lost the T20 series 2-1 to Australia, it won the ODIs 3-0, which gives them confidence going into the series against India.

“T20s are important this year given we have the T20 World Cup. But, in general, the Proteas and Cricket South Africa (CSA), we need to find ourselves growing. We have just beaten a very good team. We needed confidence and it will certainly give us a lot of confidence.”

The former wicketkeeper said Indian conditions would be tough for a lot of visiting players, who will be touring the country for the first time. “India is going to be a tough test. Different conditions. Lot of guys haven’t played a lot of cricket in India as well. What’s impressive is guys have responded to the messages we have sent out to them on batting and bowling perspectives,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/2lo3y2/article31025927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10FAF,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/south-africa-tour-of-india-india-vs-south-africa-odi-series/article31025928.ece
229,2020/03/09,Road Safety World Series | Sehwag applauds Tendulkar’s win obsession,"‘I enjoyed batting with him and watching from the other end’

In keeping with his gift for timing when batting, Virender Sehwag drew a parallel between safety in cricket and road safety.

The opener was responding to questions after an entertaining 74 not out for India Legends against West Indies Legends.

He used the pace off the Wankhede track, was in his comfort zone when rocking back for sizzling cuts and backed his instincts for brutal strokes in an unbeaten knock, laced with 11 boundaries, to walk away with the Man of the Match award in the Unacademy Road Safety World Series opening game.

Asked about safety in cricket and on the road, Sehwag said: “If I go out to bat without helmet or pads, the chances of getting hurt is higher. “Wearing a seatbelt when driving is as critical. Awareness about road safety is very important.”

The game — won by seven wickets by India Legends — was played in front of packed stands. “I was surprised at the crowd coming to watch us. I was not expecting a full house, so thanks to the Mumbai crowd,” Sehwag said, adding: “I enjoyed batting with Tendulkar and watching him from the other end.”

The two crowd-pullers rolled back the years. Sehwag quipped: “A few strokes by him in the PowerPlays were amazing.

“Watching him explode into those shots gave the impression that he is still competing and not retired. He is focussed on winning this game. Tendulkar is serious, whether gully cricket or an international match, he tries to win.”

Sehwag brought out a humorous aspect from the first wicket stand with the India captain.

“Tendulkar told me not to take risks, then would tap the ball and attempt a quick run, or would call me for a second and then decide against it.

“It was fun. We tease each other, but his seriousness at cricket is appreciated.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/aip12c/article31025422.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09VIRU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/road-safety-world-series-sehwag-applauds-tendulkars-win-obsession/article31025423.ece
230,2020/03/09,Ranji Trophy final | Bengal can claim bragging rights on day one,"Cheteshwar Pujara had fever due to throat infection but will bat on the second day, said skipper Jaydev Unadkat.

Amid a swift change in plot in the last one hour, gritty half-centuries by Avi Barot and Vishvarajsinh Jadeja took Saurashtra to 206 for five on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy final against Bengal at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium here on Monday.

Also read: Ranji Trophy 2019-20 final: The stats that matter

Electing to bat, Saurashtra conceded some momentum when it lost three wickets and saw star batsman Cheteshwar Pujara (5) retiring owing to a throat infection.

Good start

Openers Harvik Desai (38, 111b, 5x4) and Avi Barot (54, 142b, 6x4) gave Saurashtra a solid start through a fine 82-run partnership on a batsman-friendly track. It was the best opening stand by any side against Bengal this season.

Displaying sound temperament and footwork, the home openers denied the visiting pacers any early advantage. They left the good deliveries and placed the loose ones in gaps. The pair also had the Bengal fielders, who failed to grab some difficult chances, to thank.

Left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed, who bowled 20 overs on the trot in the first two sessions and posed some questions, was the one who provided Bengal the breakthrough in the third over of the post-lunch session. Desai pushed at one to be caught at silly point.

Barot, who drove beautifully on both sides, put up another noteworthy partnership of 50 runs with a confident-looking Vishvaraj (54, 92b, 7x4) to strengthen Saurashtra’s position. Young Vishvaraj, who played some crispy shots including three consecutive boundaries off Shahbaz, scored his second half-century inside three weeks.

Akash broke their association finding Barot’s outside edge. The hard-working opener opted for the DRS, but could not extend his stay.

The Bengal bowlers found better line and length on a pitch that became slower. The ball virtually rolling to the wicketkeeper on a few instances raised doubts of the match extending more than four more days.

Clutch of wickets

Bowling with a big heart, the strongly-built Akash breached Vishvaraj’s defence with a delivery that cut in sharply. Three overs later, Ishan Porel trapped Sheldon Jackson in front and Akash had nightwatchman Chetan Sakariya caught behind.

Health issues of Pujara, who came in at No. 6 and could face only 24 deliveries owing to overnight throat infection and feverishness, affected Saurashtra’s impetus. Captain Jaydev Unadkat expressed confidence that Pujara would be fit on the morrow.

Teenage Indian batting sensation Shafali Verma on Monday lost the top spot in the ICC women’s T20 International rankings as she slipped to third after managing only two runs in the World Cup final against Australia in Melbourne.

The 16-year-old Shafali (744 points) had grabbed the top spot at the end of the league stage of the just-concluded women’s T20 World Cup in Australia which the hosts won for an unprecedented fifth time.

Australia opener Beth Mooney, who hit 78 not out in the final on Sunday, jumped two spots to number one with 762 points to her kitty.

Mooney scored 259 runs at an average of 64 in six innings, the highest aggregate by anyone at a single edition of the competition and was named Player of the Tournament. She has topped the rankings for the first time in her career.

New Zealand’s Suzie Bates (750 points) remained in second position in the list that also features the Indian duo of Smriti Mandhana and Jemimah Rodrigues in the top ten.

While the India vice-captain Mandhana, who had a forgetful tournament, moved down a spot to be ranked seventh, Rodrigues remained static on ninth.

Mooney’s opening partner Alyssa Healy has risen two slots to fifth position after a blistering 39-ball 75 in the final against India while South Africa’s Laura Wolvaardt has advanced 13 slots to reach a career-best 31st place after a valiant 27-ball 41 in their semifinal against Australia.

India’s Deepti Sharma advanced 10 slots to reach 43rd position among batters and is among the top five all-rounders for the first time.

Deepti, Radha Yadav and Poonam Yadav occupied the sixth, seventh and eighth sports respectively in the bowlers ranking led by England’s Sophie Ecclestone.

Five players from Australia’s victorious team made the side of the tournament. Defending champions Australia claimed their fifth title following an 85-run triumph over first-time finalists India on Sunday in Melbourne.

Alyssa Healy, Beth Mooney, Meg Lanning, Jess Jonassen and Megan Schutt were included along with four England players.

Healy and Mooney did quite a bit of damage with the bat and the two reprised their roles as openers in the final XI.

They’re joined by fast bowler Schutt, who took four wickets in the final against India to finish as leading wicket-taker with 13, and left-arm spinner Jonassen.

Also read: No mean achievement, says Shantha

There is also a spot for captain Lanning, who led Australia from the front both with the bat and in the field.

The side was pulled together by a selection panel featuring commentators and former international players Ian Bishop, Anjum Chopra and Lisa Sthalekar, journalist Raf Nicholson and ICC representative Holly Colvin, the ICC said in a statement.

Yadav had Australia in knots in a dramatic opening game of the tournament. India’s leading T20I wicket-taker took four for 19 in the opener and didn’t look back, bagging three against Bangladesh before rounding off with wickets in each match.

Verma, on the other hand, broke record after record at the top of India’s order.

The 16-year-old scored 163 runs coming at a jaw-dropping strike rate of 158.25.

Healy and Mooney broke their own record set in 2018 with the most runs as a partnership in a Women’s T20 World Cup, with 352 at an average close to 60.

Also read: Despite the final stumble, a campaign to be proud of

They also made their second century partnership in four innings while Healy lit up Melbourne to record the quickest 50 in a Final and the highest score in the showcase.

The latter was beaten by her partner a few overs later, with Mooney’s unbeaten 78 seeing her reach 259 runs - the most for one player at any edition of the tournament.

The Australian pair are followed in the team by another stellar duo, with nobody bettering the 169-run partnership made by Nat Sciver and Heather Knight against Thailand.

The middle-order batters were in inspired form throughout, Knight becoming the first England cricketer to register centuries in all three formats with her ton against the debutants.

Sciver scored half-centuries in three of England’s four completed matches to end her tournament with 202 runs and two wickets.

South Africa’s Laura Wolvaardt only batted in two innings but certainly made her mark on the action. The 20-year-old struck 53 not out to take South Africa beyond Pakistan, with a glorious array of straight and cover drives lighting up the Sydney Showground.

The team of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2020 (in batting order) is:

Alyssa Healy (Australia, wk, 236 runs at 39.33, seven dismissals), Beth Mooney (Australia, 259 runs at 64.75), Nat Sciver (England, 202 runs at 67.33), Heather Knight (England, 193 runs at 64.33), Meg Lanning (Australia, captain, 132 runs at 44), Laura Wolvaardt (South Africa, 94 runs at strike rate of 149), Jess Jonassen (Australia, 10 wickets at 14.00), Sophie Ecclestone (England, eight wickets at 6.12), Anya Shrubsole (England, eight wickets at 10.62), Megan Schutt (Australia, 13 wickets at 10.30), Poonam Yadav (India, 10 wickets at 11.90),

236,2020/03/09,Two weeks after Delhi riots: darkness brings with it panic and fear in Shiv Vihar,"The lives of thousands across northeast Delhi were upended when the city’s worst riots since 1984 claimed 53 lives

As the sun sets over the charred ruins of what was a bustling neighbourhood two weeks ago and the shadows lengthen into night, panic escalates in northeast Delhi’s riot-scarred locality of Shiv Vihar.

“Call everybody. It’s time to leave”, Mohammed Nafis calls out urgently to his 14-year-old nephew Saif, asking him to gather the family so they can leave their ‘homes’ to return to the houses of their relatives where they have found temporary refuge.

He is not the only one.

Two Mondays ago, the lives of thousands across northeast Delhi were upended when the city’s worst riots since 1984 claimed 53 lives. At least 200 people were injured, many hundreds displaced and businesses destroyed in the riots that began on February 24 and continued till February 26.

And now, the twilight hour brings with it mounting fear that the violence will be repeated. Residents rush to leave the area that has been their home for over a decade.

“We are too scared to spend the night here. One never knows what can happen”, Nafis, who had a car seat cover workshop, told PTI.

The 41-year-old and 14 other members of his family occupied a three-storey house in gully no.12 in phase 7 of Shiv Vihar until two weeks ago, when the locality fell prey to a wave of riots.

Like his, many properties in the area were ransacked and looted before being set on fire.

Those affected by the violence have either taken shelter at government relief camps or have moved to their relatives’ houses.

They now come back every morning to take stock of the damage, and return to their temporary accommodations at the first sign of darkness.

Saif, who missed his Class 8 final exams because of the violence, starts at the sound of an approaching bike and said is too scared to walk the lanes in which he grew up.

“I am scared to take that lane. That is where they [rioters] came from. What if they come back again?” he asked, pointing to a narrow lane.

All the doors in the area are wide open — evidence of the lawless mobs that roamed unchecked.

Mohammad Gayur’s two-storey house has also been reduced to ruins. Three bikes on the ground floor were burnt, cylinders were blasted on the floor above, making the roofs of two of the three rooms collapse. His three goats were stolen.

“We were traumatised. So when police came to evacuate us early morning on February 26, we left immediately. I didn’t even wear my slippers. I was so scared. When we came back the next afternoon, everything was destroyed.”

Also read | As Delhi burned, institutions looked away

“We don’t know when we will come back. It will take at least three-four years to get back our lives”, said Mr. Gayur, who makes a living doing odd contractual jobs like painting walls.

He lived in the house with his mother, three brothers and their families.

Following the violence, the men of the house have moved to a cousin’s house in Mustafabad close by, while the women and children have taken shelter at the Idgah relief camp.

Nazar Mohammad, who relocated to his in-laws’ house in Chaman Park a few kilometres away with his wife and three sons during the riots, said his oldest child, 12, has simply refused to come back to Shiv Vihar.

“During the violence, we had taken shelter in another house nearby. Although two of my sons are too young to register what happened, my oldest has been left traumatised,” said the 44-year-old art teacher.

“He said he is not going to come back,” his wife Irshada Begum added.

The thought of returning is terrifying even for those whose houses were not rendered completely uninhabitable.

Saimur Khan, 42, keeps the doors of his house wide open during the day, hoping that the visible destruction — furniture destroyed, clothes strewn across the floor and suitcases, safes and almirahs ransacked — will get him some help from either the government or NGOs that are offering relief.

At the first sign of dusk, he is quick to lock up his house and return to his in-laws’ place near Babunagar.

“The environment here is still very uncertain. I come here in the morning so I can get some help because we lost everything. But I don’t think I am ready to come back yet,” he said.

Over 700 cases have been filed and nearly 2,400 persons have either been detained or arrested.

239,2020/03/09,"Gurugram offices cancel events, allow staff to work from home","Millennium City gears up to prevent spread of COVID-19

From allowing their employees to work from home or cancelling events involving mass gatherings to ensuring proper hygiene inside the office premises, the corporate companies in the Millennium City have been gearing up to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the National Capital Region over the past week.

2 cases in Gurugram

So far, two cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Gurugram.

Conceding that the spread of the deadly disease had thrown several challenges to the business community, including the cancellation of travels across the world, Chief Executive Officer, Nagarro, an IT service firm in Udyog Vihar, Manas Fuloria, said his company had told the employees to work from home in case they felt the need to do so, and the attendance in the office had dropped to meagre 20-30 % towards the end of this past week.

Mr. Fuloria also said that as part of precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the virus, the company indefinitely postponed its annual event slated for March-end.

Though satisfied with the efforts of the government and the district administration in handling the situation, Mr. Fuloria, feared the number of infected persons could be far more than what the official figures were suggesting and expressed apprehension that the situation, if allowed to continue for long, would have financial implications.

A spokesperson of WeWork, a real estate company providing co-working spaces, said that they were monitoring the situation closely and had implemented mandatory and precautionary measures across all their operations, in accordance with guidance from the WHO and local health authorities. “The company also has a mandatory 14-day work from home policy for any employee who have recently returned from places where the disease has spread, as well as those who exhibit flu-like symptoms, such as respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath or other breathing difficulties. WeWork members have been made aware of these policies and encouraged to adhere to the same guidelines for the sake of health and safety of the people in our workspaces,” said the spokesperson

Amandeep Jindal, building manager, AlphaCorp, said they had planned to organise a fitness session as an employee engagement activity at Golf View Tower Sector 42, but due to the “threat” that COVID-19 has posed they decided to call off the session. He added that hand sanitisers were placed at common areas on the premises as a precautionary measure.

Anu Khanna, vice president, facility management at Pioneer Urban Facility Management, said: “We have distributed masks to all the staff. In addition to this, we have strategically installed hand sanitisers at commercial buildings. We are also sanitising the lifts and common areas every few hours.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/gurugram-offices-cancel-events-allow-staff-to-work-from-home/article31017883.ece
240,2020/03/09,Delhi gurdwara panel distributes masks as stores increase price,"DSGMC plans to do same at gurdwaras across the Capital

The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) on Sunday distributed face masks in a bid to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, at Gurdwara Bangla Sahib. The DSGMC said it has planned to do the same at other gurdwaras across the city.

Manjinder Singh Sirsa, the president of the DSGMC, said that they had procured 10,000 masks to distribute and hoped that this would help people as the rising demand for face masks had resulted in charging of exorbitant prices for products by big pharmacy companies.

“All gurdwaras have been asked to take proactive steps to regularly clean and sanitise their complexes to prevent any respiratory illness,” Mr. Sirsa said.

He added that hand sanitisation has been made mandatory for all visitors at the DSGMC office complex at Gurdwara Rakab Ganj and that the volunteers are assisting and guiding the visitors on the matter to prevent the transmission of the virus.

“The DSGMC will promote frequent handwashing with soap and water among the devotees during their visit to holy shrines. All gurdwara complexes will be extensively cleaned and sanitised in order to prevent the spread of the disease,” Mr. Sirsa further said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/xo6gkk/article31019934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE09MASKGURFWARA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-gurdwara-panel-distributes-masks-as-stores-increase-price/article31017882.ece
241,2020/03/09,Plea seeks improvement of public transport to curb pollution,"A petition moved before the Delhi High Court has sought directions to the Centre and the State government to improve the public transport system in order to curb air pollution in the city by involving private companies under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative.

Tsunami on Roads, a non-government organisation (NGO), in its petition said that mass public transport systems were the most important and cost-effective means to reduce air pollution and traffic congestion, especially in cities with a population of 50 lakh or more.

It contended that the public transport system could be improved by involving private companies under the CSR initiative. It also suggested to subsidise public transportation.

The NGO also said that vehicular emissions have to be controlled as they are a major contributor — almost 41% — of PM2.5.

It also urged the Delhi High Court to order the authorities to compensate for the damage to the environment caused by fossil fuels.

The High Court has posted the case for hearing on May 10.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/plea-seeks-improvement-of-public-transport-to-curb-pollution/article31017876.ece
242,2020/03/09,COVID-19: ‘healthy people need not wear masks’,"They may touch face with dirty hands while adjusting those, says Chief Minister

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that healthy people in the Capital need not wear masks to protect themselves from COVID 19 as wearing masks would “increase the risk”. People with masks would have a tendency to constantly adjust those and thus touch their faces with hands which may not be clean, he explained.

He added that there was no need for panic buying masks and hand sanitisers and everyone should rather wash their hands with soap and water as often as possible, as a preventive measure.

“Masks and hand sanitisers only give a false sense of security. There is no substitute for frequent handwashing,” he said. Mr. Kejriwal added that those showing symptoms however, need to wear masks so that they do not cough and contaminate surfaces and lead to the spread of the virus.

The Chief Minister was addressing a press conference after a meeting of a State Task Force headed by him on COVID-19. The task force also said that there was a craze to buy N95 masks but it was not required. “There is an unnecessary rush to buy masks and hand sanitisers in the city. Instead, people should help the government identify those with symptoms of the virus and need to report the details of people who have returned from the abroad in the past 14 days and are showing any symptoms, and work together to fight COVID-19,” Mr. Kejriwal also said.

‘Play a safe Holi’

Delhi Metro, DTC buses and hospitals will be disinfected everyday, Mr. Kejriwal assured. He asked Delhiites to maintain calm, but be careful while playing Holi and to avoid crowded areas and stay safe.

The government also asked the people, who have shown symptoms, not to use any mode of public transport while going to submit their samples for testing.

Mr. Kejriwal said that 168 isolation beds had been set up at 25 hospitals for COVID-19 patients and that the government was fully prepared to deal with the situation if there is a rise in number of cases in the city.

He added that he would meet Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday to request a ban on travel to countries where a significant number of cases of COVID-19 have been reported.

Also, addressing the press conference, Nutan Mundeja, Director of Delhi Government Employees Health Scheme, said COVID-19 symptoms include cough, fever and cold and everyone should cover their mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing so that no droplets reach other person’s eyes, nose or mouth.

“A healthy person is advised not to wear a mask because by doing that, he or she is pre-disposing themselves to chances of infection. It is the social responsibility of all to advise others to wear masks if they are suffering from respiratory diseases,” Ms. Mundeja said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/covid-19-healthy-people-need-not-wear-masks/article31017875.ece
243,2020/03/09,Elaborate security arrangement in place for Holi,"702 FIRs registered and 2,387 people detained in connection with violence: police

Delhi Police has made elaborate arrangements to ensure safety and security of people during Holi. Extensive arrangements have been made in Gokalpuri, Jaffrabad, Chand Bagh and Bhajanpura that witnessed violence recently, said a senior police officer.

On Sunday, Delhi Police had registered 702 FIRs related to violence and a total of 2,387 people have been detained. Also, 283 Aman Committee meetings were held to maintain peace in north-east Delhi.

All officers and in-charges of police posts have been directed to remain present in their respective jurisdiction.

Special drive

Meanwhile, the Delhi Traffic Police said that it will be conducting special drive to control unruly and dangerous driving on the occasion of Holi.

Traffic arrangements have been in place to ensure safety of motorists on roads and check incidents of drunk driving, overspeeding, reckless driving, red light jumping, triple riding, driving by minor, driving or riding without helmet and performing stunts on two-wheelers.

According to the police, traffic police and district police will be deployed at more than 170 traffic pickets, including 131 integrated checking pickets, on the day of Holi to ensure a peaceful and safe celebration. Delhi Traffic Police will deploy around 1,600 personnel for this purpose.

244,2020/03/09,‘Hussain got pistol back 2 days before riots’,"Weapon was deposited at police station a day ahead of Assembly polls: police

Suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain got his licensed pistol back just two days before the riots in north-east Delhi, said a police officer on Sunday.

The officer said that Mr. Hussain deposited his pistol at a local police station on February 7, a day before Delhi elections, and got it released on February 22.

“We are questioning why he got his weapon released just two days before the riots. Hussain broke down twice while responding to questions. We have to take him to the locations where he was hiding after the violence. He will also be taken to the warehouse where petrol bombs and stones were found,” said the officer.

Meanwhile, Karkardooma Court on Sunday sent Riyasat Ali to three-day police custody and Liaquat to 14-day judicial custody. Both have been booked for leading a mob in Chand Bagh area during violence on February 24 and 25.

Police said that Liaquat and his son Riyasat were present on the terrace of Hussain’s house and were leading the mob who were throwing stones and petrol bombs at the crowd. The police claimed that both worked for the suspended AAP legislator.

On Sunday, Shahrukh Pathan, who pointed a pistol at a police official during riots in Maujpur, was taken to the location in Jaffrabad where he opened fire during violence.

245,2020/03/09,Women’s Day invigorates protesters at Shaheen Bagh,"Stalls set up at venue to help riot victims irrespective of their religion

The women-led anti-citizenship protest at Shaheen Bagh, which entered the 85th day on Sunday, got a shot in the arm with supporters turning up in large numbers to mark the International Women’s Day.

The makeshift shade set up on an arterial road connecting Delhi with Noida, where the protests has been taking place since mid December last year, was reconfigured to make more room for protesters whose number swelled after noon.

Most of them who came up on the dais to speak against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) kept their theme close to Women’s Day.

To mark the day, women and girls from the area set up stalls next to the makeshift shade to sell handmade items, including paintings, bangles and earrings. The money collected through this will be donated to victims and their families, who were affected in the riots that took place in north-east Delhi, irrespective of their religion.

Shaheen Kauser, a resident of the area who has been actively involved in the protest, said that the most important thing for the movement right now is to maintain peace.

“We have appealed to the people to be peaceful. On International Women’s Day, we also have a message that the country is for everyone. Live and let live,” she said.

For a cause

Shaheen Malik, who had put up a stall to sell handmade earrings and bangles, said she, along with her sisters and friends, have been making the items for the last three days.

The 26-year-old student of Jamia Millia Islamia said, “All the proceeds from the sale will go to the victims of riots cutting across religion and community. We are not keeping anything.”

“We have different variety of designs including ‘Kashmiri Jhumke’ which are hot sellers,” Ms. Malik said, adding that the price of items have been kept low and range between ₹50 and ₹250.

Creativity and protest

A unique stall combining creativity and protest was set up by 23-year-old Kauser Jahan which had handmade prints that conveyed the artist’s stance towards CAA, NRC and NPR.

“We also did paintings and murals on the roads here at Shaheen Bagh. What began at Jamia has grown on to become such a big movement as Shaheen Bagh is followed not just in India but also internationally,” Ms. Jahan said.

She also narrated how the recent riots in Delhi has been a difficult time for her and family. “As a Muslim, most people here had close relatives or friends there in north-east Delhi. So we were emotionally connected,” she said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lxhn78/article31017841.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL09-SHAHEENBAGH4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/womens-day-invigorates-protesters-at-shaheen-bagh/article31017843.ece

247,2020/03/09,Search for happiness,"Interpretation of the Upanishad statements continues till date and offers new insights, though the texts belong to a time that goes far beyond what is available as recorded history. This is because they speak of matters relevant for all times and are storehouses of the awareness of eternal truth that the ancient sages steeped in meditation have discovered. Their discoveries have tried to fulfil the emotional, intelligent and intellectual requirement of the individual and society, fostering posterity’s spiritual growth and civilization, said Swami Nirviseshananda Tirtha in a discourse.

The subject matter of the Upanishads is human experience, and hence the validity of their study and observations can be established at the experiential rather than the rational level. For instance, the Upanishad seers, while observing the various phenomena in the external world, such as day and night or the seasons following one another, the birth, growth, decay and death of all living beings, etc, as characterised by constant change, also recognised the presence of something eternal behind all this ceaseless activity. Another important discovery is that in all beings there is the basic desire to remain happy. They have identified this yearning to be the result of an inherent lack or insufficiency or emotional gap. Ironically, when people in search of happiness are driven to look for it in the world around, this effort is sure to remain ever elusive. For, one may go on interacting with the world hoping he will somehow gain that happiness, only to be disappointed. Even if one possesses the whole world there is no guarantee that it will be his always. Moreover, fresh desires will arise. The seers have shown thus that the essence of happiness is within each one in the undying immortal self that has to be recognised.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/search-for-happiness/article31018837.ece
248,2020/03/09,The Awadh Nawab’s dubious gift to Delhi,"Safdarjang’s Tomb is one of the last specimens of Mughal architecture

The last vestige of Mughal architecture exists on the road to the Qutb, which I revisited recently under balmy skies. It is Safdarjang’s Tomb and commemorates Mansoor Ali Khan Safdarjang, the second Nawab of Awadh.

Designed on the pattern of Humayun’s tomb, it is a poor imitation and does not stand in comparison with the older building at all, on either aesthetic and architectural levels.

The three-storey tomb in fawn-coloured stone also bears a faint resemblance to Akbar’s mausoleum at Sikandra, but lacks the magnificence of the latter. Even so, it is an interesting monument, situated amidst a garden of about 250 square metres, and enclosed by a wall at the corners of which stand octagonal towers.

Arcaded pavilions, named Moti Mahal, Badshah Pasand and Jangli Mahal, have been constructed on the northern, southern and eastern sides, like the pavilions in the outer quadrangle of the Taj. It is believed that these were meant for the accommodation of nobles who visited the mausoleum and could not return home quickly, because journeys took so long in the days of animal-driven carriages and travellers had perforce to camp for days on reaching their destination.

The tomb has a carved cenotaph in the central chamber within which is another chamber containing two unmarked graves, both with earthen mounds above them. In it lie buried Mirza Muquim Abul Mansoor Khan Safdarjang, and his wife Banu Begum.

The monument was built by their son Shujauddaulah at a cost of ₹3 lakhs with a lot of marble and other material being pinched from the mausoleum of the Khan-e-Khana and other Mughal buildings, to embellish the tomb.

Safdarjang was the Wazir of Oudh at the court of Mohammad Shah and later the head of the Shia Irani Party and Prime Minister at the court of Ahmad Shah (1748-1754). His opponents were the leaders of the Sunni Turani party. Safdarjang was dismissed because of his failures as Prime Minister and retired to Lucknow where he succeeded his uncle to the throne of Oudh.

He died at Faizabad in 1754 and his body was brought for burial to Delhi, as he had pined for his days of grandeur in the Capital and desired that he be laid to rest there.

Looking at the floodlit tomb now one is reminded of the nobleman and his life and times. His mausoleum is as haphazard as his own life was, with Mughal, Rajput, Iranian and Egyptian architecture jostling for space in the building.

His son, Shujauddaulah, who was reputed to have the biggest moustaches in the whole Mughal empire, rose to greater eminence, and as the Wazir of Shah Alam won back the position his father had lost to the Sunni Party.

In 1761 the Wazir played a big role, along with the Nawab of Bengal, to contain the power of the British and perpetuate the Mughal dynasty.

But the scheme failed when Shah Alam and his supporters were defeated at the Battle of Buxar. It was then that the English were granted the Diwani of Bengal after which they had the emperor in their clutches.

Safdarjang’s Tomb reminds us of all this and also of the handsome eunuch whom he proclaimed as Padshah after his dismissal by Ahmad Shah.

Safdarjang declared him to be the grandson of Kam Bakhsh, the youngest son of Aurangzeb. The monument has been aptly called “the last flickering lamp of Mughal architecture”.

ASQ is the world’s leading airport passenger service and benchmarking programme measuring passengers’ satisfaction while they travel through an airport.

The award will be conferred during the ASQ Awards Ceremony to be held during the third ACI Customer Experience Global Summit, taking place in Krakow, Poland, in September 2020.

“Your customers have spoken and recognised the successful efforts of your team in providing a superior customer experience. Once again, my heartfelt thanks and warmest congratulations to you and your entire airport community. You make us proud,” said ACI world director general Angela Gittens.

“The ASQ awards represent the highest possible recognition for airport operators around the world and recognise excellence in customer experience,” she said, in a communication sent to the airport authorities. GHIAL CEO S.G.K. Kishore said the award is “testimony to our tireless efforts to make our passenger experience the best and our pursuit towards excellence”.

He pointed out that the airport had been recently certified as a carbon neutral (level 3+) airport, a feat achieved thrice in a row.

250,2020/03/09,Doctor shoots himself at home,"A 43-year-old doctor died of bullet injury at his villa in Saket Mithila gated community on Monday.

Jawaharnagar police of Rachakonda said that Dr. Ravindra Kumar, managing director of Sri Aditya Hospitals, Dammaiguda, committed suicide by shooting himself with a pistol in his bedroom.

Investigators believe that the incident took place after 2 a.m. when his wife and son were not at home. “His wife, Dr. Smitha, along with their 12-year-old son had gone to her parents’ house in Dilsukhnagar and at 2 a.m. he spoke to his son over the phone. It looks like he resorted to the extreme step after 2 a.m.,” Jawaharnagar inspector P. Bikshapathi Reddy said.

Dr. Kumar’s licensed pistol was recovered near his body, but no suicide note was found in the house.

On Sunday night, the couple had an argument over attending a family function, following which Dr. Smitha left home and went to her parents' house.

According to police, the incident came to light around 1.30 p.m. on Monday when Dr. Smitha’s sister Swapna visited the victim’s house as he was not answering calls from his wife and hospital staff. “When he did not respond even after repeated knocks on the door, Ms. Swapna opened the bedroom window from outside and found him lying in a pool of blood,” Mr. Reddy said. Dr. Kumar’s face was covered with blood, as he shot himself on the temple. He was scheduled to perform a surgery on Monday.

When asked whether the victim was facing any financial problems, Malkajgiri DCP Rakshita K Murthy said, “nothing that we are aware of. A case has been registered and a probe is on to ascertain the reason for this extreme step.”

The body was shifted to Gandhi Hosptial morgue for autopsy.

251,2020/03/09,"Not in contact with father since Pranay’s death, says Maruthi Rao's daughter","‘He must have felt remorse for what he had done’

Amrutha Varshini, widow of Perumalla Pranay Kumar, said she had not been in contact with her father Tirunagaru Maruthi Rao ever since the murder of her husband in September 2018.

Speaking to reporters outside her in-laws’ house here, moments after Maruthi Rao’s body was found at Arya Vysya Bhavan in Hyderabad, she said she learnt about the news on the television.

“I will respond on it tomorrow. I did not speak or meet him (Maruthi Rao) after Pranay’s murder,” she said.

Further, when asked about the sudden death, especially when the court proceedings are going on, Ms. Amrutha said: He must have felt remorse for what he had done.

The news of Maruthi Rao’s death around 9 a.m. on Sunday soon turned the small town into a buzz of activity with people and media gathering outside the houses of Pranay at Muthireddykunta Colony, and Maruthi Rao. Police force too was fully deployed to avert any unforeseen situation. On the other hand, associations linked to the business-pursuing Arya Vysya community expressed shock and grief at the sudden death of their most successful icon here. “It is very unfortunate that this has happened, we are unable to digest the news. On the whole, we all understand that Maruthi Rao is the person who lost the most – love, family or respect,” said district president of Arya Vysya Sangham, Yanna Murali.

A large congregation of leaders from across the State and other parts of the country, in the Arya Vysya affiliation, are also gathering here to express their condolences to the Tirunagaru family. Maruthi Rao’s body was transported here in the evening after post-mortem in Hyderabad, and kept at the Arya Vysa Bhavan for visitors.

In a statement here, Mr. Rao thanked the government for the allocation and said under Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar’s Rao’s leadership, Hyderabad is transforming itself into a global city.

He said huge allocation of funds earlier to the police department helped in improving law and order in the city.

Later, large amount of funds have also been allocated to the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) projects in Hyderabad to strengthen the road network in the city.

253,2020/03/09,"Case against Maruthi Rao was too strong: police, advocates","In a suicide note, he urges: Amrutha go to your mom

Not just relatives and friends of T. Maruthi Rao are shocked at his sudden death, but police officers who were part of the interrogation in Nalgonda too are in a similar state.

“Never thought he would commit suicide. He didn’t look like he was afraid at any point during the course of interrogation,” says an officer.

A few media persons also recollected his posture during the press meet on September 18, 2018.

“Wearing a blue tee, a hand in his pocket, he was the only one looking at the cameras while all others were looking downward,” the police officials said.

But observers, like the Miryalaguda police and advocates of the Nalgonda district court, point to his weakening defence, especially when the final framing of charges was fast approaching, after which the trial would be in motion, and that his chances of conviction were strong.

“The hospital CCTV footage showing the man hacking Pranay Kumar from behind, call logs of Maruthi Rao with others, Subhash Sharma’s statement included, is all irrefutable evidence,” says a Miryalaguda-based lawyer, requesting anonymity.

Unverified versions, among the victim’s friends and those in the Arya Vysya Sangam, also include: “He was unable to sell his properties, there was persistent demand for money from outsiders, a dead body was found in his shed recently, the brothers were not in talking terms and he also could not arrange a lawyer in Nalgonda or Miryalaguda.”

The town police too has several instances, where Maruthi Rao’s daughter Amrutha complained that the family was consulting her indirectly for a reunion, but all those attempts had failed.

The purported short note left by Maruthi Rao, which came to light on Sunday, is also contextual: “Forgive me Girija, Amrutha go to your mom.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/case-against-him-was-too-strong/article31018395.ece

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao announced a fund of ₹ 10,000 crore for development of Hyderabad urban agglomeration area comprising the core city and outskirts in his budget speech.

Describing Hyderabad as the jewel of Telangana, he said this city with four hundred year history had got name and fame as the most affordable and liveable city. With moderate climatic conditions and cosmopolitan culture, Hyderabad earned worldwide fame and appreciation. Due to unscrupulous policies adopted in the erstwhile combined State, the city life had become full of turmoil. Facilities had not been improved in proportion to the growth of population. Though the Chief Minister had requested the Centre to grant special funds for Hyderabad and five other metropolitan cities in India, the same was not conceded. However, the Telangana government had estimated requirement of ₹ 50,000 crore in the next five years to take up development works in Hyderabad as it is being transformed into an international city. Therefore, an amount of ₹ 10,000 crore was proposed in this budget to carry out Musi river purification, Musi riverfront project and all other special projects and works in agglomeration area.

A bit relieved but high on alert. That is how Health officials have been after learning that the 24-year-old techie, who had tested positive for COVID-19 last week, tested negative on Sunday.

The youth had been admitted at Gandhi Hospital on March 1 evening and news of him testing positive trickled in the next afternoon.

He was admitted to the coronavirus ICU at Gandhi Hospital. After six days of treatment, samples were collected from him and tested negative.

However, there was no official announcement about it till the time of going to press.

“His condition has improved, but he will continue to be under treatment for at least seven more days. He has to test negative twice before he can be discharged,” an official told The Hindu.

The techie was initially diagnosed with viral pneumonia. His lungs condition has improved too. Earlier, officials said that they will adopt the method followed by Kerala Health department to discharge the recovered patient. The process might involve sending samples to National Institute of Virology, Pune, for confirmation.

Despite heaving a sigh of relief, officials said they can’t afford to be lax in any sense.

As preparations are under way to establish an isolation ward at the Government General and Chest Hospital, Eraggadda, the health facility still awaits health resources such as hematology analyser, ABG analyser, falcon tubes and generator.

Officials said they have received the requests from the hospital’s administration. “The process of procuring the resources has been expedited since this is an emergency situation. We are finding ways to get them at the earliest,” an official said on the condition of anonymity.

258,2020/03/09,"COVID-19 | In breach of protocol, samples fetched from VIP’s home in Telangana","‘This is a missed chance to set an example that even family members of influential people opt for government hospitals for treatment’

Amid intense efforts by Health officials to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the State, a hush-hush task was taken up last Wednesday. Samples from two young family members of a Telangana political leader were collected from their home, in what is a clear violation of protocol.

The duo in question had travelled to Dubai in February. Sources said at least three persons were sent in a vehicle on Wednesday to collect the sample from the suspected patients’ house on the city outskirts. Officials in the know heaved a sigh of relief when the samples collected from them tested negative the following day.

Usually, if a person has travel history to any of the virus-affected countries such as China and Italy, and show symptoms such as fever, cold, cough, they are admitted to isolation wards of Gandhi Hospital. People are also isolated if they have been in contact with a suspected patient. Thereafter, their swab samples are collected and sent for tests at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) laboratory at Gandhi Medical College.

Last week, the State government granted permission to some private hospitals, too, to isolate patients, collect samples and send them to the laboratory for tests.

“In this case, samples were collected by going to their home. Why was the staff sent there rather than having them admitted to the isolation ward? Why was protocol not followed in case of VIPs? If we look at the situation in another way, this is a missed chance to set an example that even family members of influential people opt for government hospitals for treatment.

259,2020/03/09,Hospital turns away people seeking COVID-free certificate,"Several requests have poured in at Gandhi in past week

There is a new addition to the category of people rushing to Gandhi Hospital to get tested for COVID-19.

Those with plans to travel to a foreign country for business purposes or to rejoin work have been making a beeline at the hospital, requesting for medical certificates that state they are coronavirus-free.

Prevented by protocol

However, they are being turned back as the protocol does not allow samples to be tested for the purpose.

A youth from Tolichowki, who works at a mineral water plant in Kuwait, returned home two months ago and has to report back to duty soon.

“I have to go to Kuwait to resume work. But I have been asked to produce a medical certificate declaring I am not infected with coronavirus. I am scared to walk into the hospital,” he said.

No symptoms, no test

Confirming that they received several such requests throughout last week, officials said they are following Central government guidelines which state that only people who have travel history to COVID-19-affected countries and show symptoms such as cold and fever are to be isolated and tested. Samples are also collected from close contacts of those with the travel history, when symptoms appear.

‘Staff stretched thin’

“Our staff are already stretched thin in testing samples of the suspects. If we start testing samples of people waiting for medical clearance to travel abroad, it will cause delay for people who need immediate attention,” officials said.

Staff at COVID-19 help desk in the main building of Gandhi Hospital are also encountering many anxious visitors who have travel history to certain coronavirus-affected countries but have had no symptoms.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hospital-turns-away-people-seeking-covid-free-certificate/article31017924.ece
260,2020/03/09,When 30 Chennai guitarists join hands,"From new performers to festival directors and music school founders, they all bring their signature, varied sounds together for a single track under Ultimate Chennai Guitarists Chillstep Collective

Paul Vicc, the Chennai-based electric guitarist of the globally renowned Shillong Chamber Choir, kicks it off with a spirited, reverberating riff of 30 seconds. At that mark, YouTuber and author Ashok Janardhanan picks up the relay with a tune that is more deliberate, before handing it over to Chennai Guitar Fest director Matt Bacon who goes all-out rockstar on it.

On and on it goes, for 11 minutes and 50 seconds, as 30 of Chennai’s leading guitarists bring their own colour to one continuous backing track, in a project called the Ultimate Chennai Guitarists Chillstep Collective.

Dreamed up by Chris Jason, the final edit of this month-long project was released on YouTube this weekend, garnering a little over 3,000 views in the first 24 hours and drawing responses not only from gushing fans, but also from those curious and new to the city’s music circuit.

Chris made the backing track himself — a light, bluesy strum designed to meet his specific requirements. “The E major chord is fun to play on the guitar. I made the track in a way that gives them more space to play with it,” he says over a quick phone chat between gigs.

He started working on it in February, and the entire project was completed within a month. “I had contacted around 35 guitarists for it, 29 of whom got back to me. Not too bad.”

They all had two instructions to follow. The first, of course, was playing to the backup track. The second, in Chris’ words: “I don’t want you to stick to a particular genre. I want you to be yourself.” They did both, with a flourish that makes the final edit a rollercoaster of sheerjoy.

Pool of talent

A guitarist himself, Chris’ choice of fellow artistes is worth a deeper look. There are the out-and-out popular ones like Keba Jeremiah, but there are also those with more niche sounds and slimmer followings. An example of the latter is Baidurjya Banerjee of city-based indie band Attva. As Chris explains, “He played a complicated toprock bit, and had a lot of variety in his solo. His band in general has a lot of soulful Hindi lyrics and toprock music.”

The talent in this one track spans everything from the hardcore metal to the experimentally classical. One of the bits that stand distinctly apart is the composition by Shylu Ravindran, lead guitarist of Jatayu. Shylu’s section, though impressive, was pretty on-brand, considering Jatayu’s style of music. “Shylu clearly has a very Carnatic background. It was interesting to see him interpret it [the backing track] that way,” observes Chris, “Carnatic does not have the kind of harmonies that Western music does, but it has melodies that Western music cannot even come close to.”

But not everyone stuck to their known brand of music: some of them took both Chris and their fans by surprise. Chris takes the example of Cletus Amalan. “He plays Vertigo, which creates soft, ambient indie music. Here, though, he was throwing in note after note every second.”

Variations in this video don’t end with the music alone. The men themselves — yes, they are all men — have interesting bios of their own. Many have made a mark in the scene beyond just their compositions and performances. Ashok Janardhanan is a YouTuber and the author of Guitar Buddy, a book intended at helping budding guitarists figure the instrument out. Roshan George Thomas is an acoustical designer at E Flat solutions, and “designs acoustic panels for home studios.” Ebenezer Premkumar is the director of Muzikgarage, a music school based in Bengaluru. “He is one of the first people I ever worked for. I used to teach guitar at the Adyar branch of his institute,” says Chris.

Others are musicians he came to know of over his years in the circuit, and yet others were recommended to him specifically for this project. Talented as the pool is, he does acknowlede the glut of women in it. “Guitar playing seems to be a men’s sport, for the most part,” he observes, “A lot of people still expect women to only sing: most of those who know the guitar seem to know just enough to back their vocals, and not experiment. I was told of some good guitarists after this track came out, though.”

He adds that this situation is on the mend, at least overseas. “In the international circuit, there are a few really good guitarists coming up now. Nita Strauss and Nili Brosh play hardcore metal, and Lari Basilio is popular on Instagram,” he says.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ypbgd3/article31023733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10MPChrisJasonHeavensMelodyjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/when-30-chennai-guitarists-join-hands/article31023743.ece
261,2020/03/09,Busting the many myths about masks,"No point in a healthy person wearing mask, says IMA leader

In the wake of more number of COVID-19 cases, the demand for medical masks has gone up. However, medical professionals say that panic buying of such items should be stopped immediately.

When seeing a person wearing mask, many people wonder whether they need to buy it too. However, there was no point in a healthy person wearing mask, said Dr. Rajeev Jayadevan, president, Indian Medical Association, Kochi.

Wearing a mask perhaps would make a person touch her face ten times more, he said.

That would be more risky, he added.

Using mask gives only a false sense of security to people.

It should actually be worn only by those who have upper respiratory infection so that they do not spread it to others through cough or sneeze.

Panic buying

Panic buying of face masks would result in short supply. It should be reserved for those who need them.

Apart from the patient, healthcare professionals should also wear masks because of the close contact they have with patients, sources said.

Since the infection is spread through body fluid droplets like large sprays of droplets through cough and sneeze, microbes could remain on surfaces of objects that an infected person touches by hand or if body fluid droplets are allowed to fall on surfaces such as e tables, chairs, and handrails.

When a healthy person touches these surfaces and touches her face, the virus finds a way into another host through the nostrils, mouth or eyes.

Frequent handwashing that would keep hands free of germs is the solution.

There are two types of face masks.

One is an ordinary face mask made of unwoven fabric and the other is N95 respirators.

The ordinary face mask fits loosely and prevent the wearer from spreading large sprays and droplets when coughing or sneezing.

Airborne particles

N95 respirators prevent the wearer from inhaling smaller airborne infectious particles.

262,2020/03/09,Naming of road invites criticism,"Road stretch between Ernakulam North overbridge and North Railway Station named after the late MP M.I. Shanavas

Naming of a 200-metre city road segment after a deceased political leader has left a section of traders and local inhabitants miffed.

The civic authorities of Kochi on Tuesday named the road stretch between Ernakulam North overbridge and North Railway Station after former parliamentarian M.I. Shanavas. He was a native of Kochi and had a wide network of friends and relatives in the city from where he picked up the nuances of politics.

However, the naming of the road has not gone down well with people like V. Ajikumar, a dentist who had come to the area to open his dental clinic three decades ago.

“The road that runs through the area had long been known as North Railway Station Road. The name of the area has been given as North Railway Station Road in most of the commercial contracts including the registration of land and rental and purchase agreements of the properties. When the civic authorities change the name of the road in one fine morning, it would lead to a host of legal issues besides causing confusion,” said Dr. Ajikumar.

The civic authorities had earlier named it after Xavier Arakkal, another MP. This is the third time in three decades that the name of the road is being changed, he said.

George Thaliyath, who runs a dry-cleaning shop in the area, too feels that the naming of the road would lead to confusion among general public. The sudden change of name of the road will lead to confusion while giving the location of the shop in advertisements, he said.

At the same time, K.H. Zakkir, who is running a mobile shop in the area, said the name of the road was changed after the local traders submitting a memorandum to the civic authorities. The naming of the road need not cause any confusion, he said.

Defending the decision, Ernakulam North councillor Gracy Babu Jacob said there was no name for the nearly 200-metre road segment between the North overbridge and the North Railway Station. It was the road stretch between the ESI Road and Ernakulam North that was named after Xavier Arakkal, she said.

Samples collected from the child’s parents have now been sent for testing to the National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha.

Since March 3, the Cochin International Airport Ltd. had introduced universal screening and the child, with high fever, was taken immediately in a special ambulance of the health department to the isolation ward. The child’s parents had also been admitted there, said district administration officials.

“There’s no need to panic,” assured District Collector S. Suhas.

Officials said that details of the passengers of flight No. EK530 by which they arrived were being collected. “Those who came in close contact with the child are already under observation. Meanwhile, the child’s condition remains stable,” they said.

A total of 12 people suspected to have contracted COVID-19 are under observation at the isolation of ward of the Ernakulam Medical College right now.

268,2020/03/09,Campaign to oust Mayor likely to be renewed,"LDF may move another no-confidence motion

The political campaign to unseat Mayor Soumini Jain is likely to be renewed in the Kochi Corporation shortly.

The moves to oust Ms. Jain are likely to gather steam after March 13, when the six-month cooling period for moving another no-confidence motion ends. It was on September 13 last year that Ms. Jain survived a no-confidence motion sponsored by the Left Democratic Front (LDF).

The LDF may consider moving a fresh no-confidence motion against the Mayor with the hope that the second attempt to displace her will succeed, considering the intense organisational crisis that has gripped the Congress.

Last time, the LDF’s hopes to unseat her were dashed as the State leadership of the Congress asked the district unit of the party to issue a whip to the Congress councillors to vote for Ms. Jain. Since then, the factional feud in the Congress has intensified, leading to disciplinary action against some of Ms. Jain’s supporters.

Though it had not been formally decided, the LDF was toying with the idea of once again moving a no-confidence motion, indicated an LDF leader.

Political affairs panel

The attempts of Congress legislators from the district to displace Ms. Jain got stuck midway as the political affairs committee of the party, which discussed the issue, entrusted party State president Mullapally Ramachandran to take a decision. The functioning of the committee has come to a standstill after questions were raised about the need for such a forum in the party, thereby putting the issue of leadership change on the back burner.

Councillor suspended

The party leadership had lost its face when Gracy Joseph, the Congress councillor and chairperson of the development standing committee, declined to put in her papers despite the party leadership asking her to step down. Even though Ms. Joseph was suspended from the Congress on disciplinary grounds, the party abstained from removing her from the post as it feared that any such attempt would culminate in the Congress losing the chairperson post of the committee.

It was the defeat of the party nominee to the chairperson’s post in the town planning standing committee, which it had been holding since the beginning of the term of the present dispensation, that forced the party leaders to rework their strategies. LDF candidate Sunila Selvan became the chairperson as Congress votes were not polled in favour of the party candidate.

Some of the Congress councillors, said a Jain loyalist, were determined to unseat her from the post though hardly six months were left for the present council to complete its term. However, such attempts were unlikely to succeed, he added.

A prominent detractor of Ms. Jain said some of the Congress councillors would defy the party whip next time and vote to dislodge her. Discontent was brewing in the party rank and file as they were fed up with the present dispensation, he added.

The two women, whom the party had handed over major responsibilities, had caused much harm to the organisation and brought disrepute by disobeying the party leadership.

A section of the Congress councillors would seek revenge for that by defying the whip and voting against Ms. Jain, he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/campaign-to-oust-mayor-likely-to-be-renewed/article31018659.ece

Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) honoured six women commuters who have travelled by the metro most often on Sunday on the occasion of International Women’s Day. KMRL and Axis Bank officials handed over Kochi-1 Card gift vouchers to the commuters at an event held at Edappally metro station.

Meanwhile, women in fields including law, environment, theatre and social service were honoured and celebrated to commemorate Women’s Day near Gandhi Bhavan here on Sunday.

Students from Rajagiri College of Social Sciences and Bharata Mata College, Thrikkakara, participated in the event, which was also organised with the message of a world without violence and war, particularly in a situation in which women across the country lack safe spaces.

270,2020/03/09,MVD probing ways to nab young violators,"Deploying mobile inspection teams, posting personnel at junctions mulled

With young two-wheeler riders and others often giving enforcement personnel the slip during inspections, Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) personnel are probing ways to intercept them using innovative methods.

This comes in the wake of increasing traffic rule violations by youngsters, including teenagers.

“Many of them, do not pay heed if we signal them to stop. They include youth who have illegally altered their vehicles in order to catch the attention of passers-by through irritating or deafening noise. They increase the throttle, or zigzag and make way through traffic, ignoring MVD and police personnel. There is little we can do to identify them since the registration number plate will not be legible or visible,” said an MVD officer.

A simple way is to deploy a second mobile inspection team a little ahead to intercept such rule breakers. But this might cause accidents. Other time-tested methods used in other States include positioning personnel at traffic junctions to keep a tab on such motorists and nab them then and there. In the absence of frequent junctions, especially along highways, barricades can be placed across the road to intercept them. The practice is adopted in many States, including Tamil Nadu.

Parking lots

An even safer way is to monitor parking lots, identify rule breakers and verify registration details of vehicles. Action can be taken against them even if their owners are not in the vicinity, once their address is thus identified. Yet another method is to install high-resolution night-vision cameras along highways and city roads. “It is high time cameras which have 360-degree view were installed in patrol vehicles. This too will help identify rule violators who tend to escape when personnel are busy issuing challans to motorists whom they have booked,” said another MVD official.

Apart from being a deterrent, the focus on purposeful offences that inconvenience road users and pose threat to their safety will also help build a foolproof case against rule breakers. They would thus stand the test even before courts of law, where evidence and due procedure matter much, he added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ia8noq/article31018627.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08KIMOTORBIKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/mvd-probing-ways-to-nab-young-violators/article31018628.ece
271,2020/03/09,When your own food is not part of the show,"Moviegoers in the city continue to face the ban on bringing food of their choice and water bottles from outside to cinema halls

Moviegoers in the city continue to face the ban on bringing food of their choice and water bottles from outside to cinema halls.

From biscuit packets to snacks and fruit juices, movie buffs are screened at the halls, especially at the ones functioning inside city malls.

The screening begins at the security counter where one has to open one’s bags for security personnel to take a look. The seized foodstuff are to be left at the security counter and may be collected after the movie, forcing people to buy food from counters operating inside the multiplexes.

“Once, I had to raise my voice as the personnel did not allow me to take a water bottle meant for my kids to the cinema hall. It was after much arguments that they permitted me to take the bottle inside. I had a tough time convincing them that I could not give drinking water brought from outside to my child, who was convalescing from an illness,” said M. Sruthi, a movie enthusiast.

“It’s not just about preventing people from taking food inside, but also about fleecing customers. The food that is sold across the counters are exorbitantly priced,” said Simmi, an avid moviegoer.

“A few months ago, I had carried a packet of biscuit in my handbag to the theatre. After inspection, they wanted me to hand over the packet to them, which is unjustifiable. Even the drinking water sold there is sold at higher rates and one may not be able to afford it every time,” she added.

In another instance, a woman journalist, who was accompanying her pregnant friend, was forced to leave food and water that were taken in for the expectant mother. Repeated pleas for letting in the water bottle fell on deaf ears, she said.

On another occasion, the security guard took away food purchased from the snacks counter operating on another floor of the mall. “She wanted the food to be left at the counter though she allowed me to return and have it during intermission time,” she said.

Exorbitant rates

At the eateries operated on the theatre premises, a cup of coffee could cost you anything between ₹90 and ₹110. One will have to shell out at least ₹250 for a medium sized bucket of caramel popcorn. A vegetable sandwich could cost ₹150 and hot dogs could set you back by ₹250.

“The security guards do not spare even patients who may have to take home-cooked or boiled water,” said Sreelatha Parameswaran, a lawyer practising at the Kerala High Court. “Once, the security guards forced us to abandon drinking water brought from home for my cousin who had undergone a kidney transplant. We tried to reason with the security guards, citing his precarious health condition. His repeated pleas failed to move them and he was deprived of drinking water,” said Ms. Parameswaran.

The absence of a legal framework to govern the sale of foodstuff at cinema halls, and special events such as sports, festivals and trade fairs, was being exploited by traders, admitted a senior government official handling the Consumers Affairs portfolio.

There were complaints that cricket fans had to pay through their nose for food and water during some of the Indian Premier League matches held in Kerala. The government successfully introduced a price regulator mechanism during the Sabarimala pilgrimage, which benefited pilgrims. The Kerala High Court had upheld the decision of the State government, the official said.

According to S. Sanal Kumar, a lawyer, there is no justification for selling foodstuff at prices above the Maximum Retail Price (MRP). Cinema halls are public places where entry is regulated by fees. The consumer goods and food can be sold only on MRP and banning moviegoers from bringing food items amounts to fleecing. The ban would force customers to purchase food at high prices, he said.

At the same time, those at the call centre of PVR Cinemas, which screens movies in a few city malls, said it was the policy of the company not to allow food from outside to be brought into the theatres. There had not been any update on the policy, said a customer care executive at the call centre.

One of the management representatives of Oberon Mall, when contacted, said the mall management had noting to do with the affairs of the movie halls functioning there. It was up to the firms running the cinema halls to decide on those aspects, he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/klzlsg/article31018577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08KIPOPCORN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/when-your-own-food-is-not-part-of-the-show/article31018583.ece
272,2020/03/09,Journalist awaits justice 9 years after murder bid,"Probe ordered into alleged loss of evidence

A senior journalist in Arunachal Pradesh, who was shot at by a gunman outside her office in the capital Itanagar almost nine years ago, has found out that the material evidence and case records are “untraceable”.

It took a long time for Tongam Rina, the associate editor of The Arunachal Times, to recover from a bullet, fired point blank, that damaged her spine. The murder attempt on July 15, 2012, was made two months after her office was vandalised following reports in the daily on the PDS scam and shady hydro-power deals.

She has been fighting two cases since — one of the attack on the newspaper’s office at the court of the Judicial Magistrate First Class and the other related to the murder attempt at the court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate. The two courts are in the same complex and share the storage for all documents.

Appearing for a hearing in the office attack case on March 2, Ms. Tongam discovered that the CCTV footage of the attack and damaged computers kept at the local police station’s storeroom had gone missing. “The police said the evidence had been submitted to the court. The court said it had no records. It is time the judiciary, the police and the State government came up with answers — answers I have been denied for so long,” she said.

The case record related to the bid on her too has been stuck in the court.

Director-General of Police Rajendra Pal Upadhyaya said an inquiry had been instituted into the alleged loss of evidence. “The inquiry will be conducted by Mari Riba, the Deputy Inspector-General (Intelligence),” he told The Hindu.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/c7lbq2/article31018568.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tongam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/journalist-awaits-justice-9-years-after-murder-bid/article31018718.ece
273,2020/03/09,‘Plurals’ pops up in Bihar,"‘Bihar Deserves Better, And Better is Possible’: party

On International Women’s Day, people of Bihar woke up to a two-page advertisement in most of the newspapers on Sunday. It read, “Plurals has arrived,” with the tag-line, “Love Bihar, Hate Politics”.

As the Bihar Assembly elections are months away, it was a call from a party which declared its president Pushpam Priya Choudhary the chief ministerial candidate.

“You focus on climbing the ladder, and let us deal with the snakes,” said Pushpam Priya Choudhary.

The party says in the advertisement that it enters the elections because “Bihar Deserves Better, And Better is Possible”. Earlier, none had heard the name of the party or that of its president.

The advertisement in a local edition of a national English daily also carried a photograph of Pushpam Priya Choudhary, leaning on a table with a bookshelf in the background. It said, “Plurals — everyone governs. Love Bihar, Hate Politics — join the most progressive political party.”

“Join me to take the power back,” it added, detailing Pushpam Priya Choudhary’s social media accounts and a toll-free number (1800-313-0082) which, when dialled, kept saying, “You seem to have dialled the wrong number. Please check the number you’ve dialled”.

In the second page, she has posted another picture of her sitting beneath a statue of Mahatma Gandhi. “The Revolution has begun — A party that manifests positive politics & policy making,” said the advertisement with another tag-line, “Take interest, to control politics, else it will continue to control you”.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/plurals-pops-up-in-bihar/article31018703.ece
274,2020/03/09,Special Women’s Day for former Maoists,"Malkangiri police honours 15 surrendered women cadre at a ceremony

Odisha’s Malkangiri district police celebrated International Women’s Day at a special ceremony that included surrender of a woman Maoist cadre from Chhattisgarh and honouring of 15 former Maoists from the district.

At the ceremony held at Malkangiri district police headquarters on Sunday, Debe Sodi (22), a Maoist cadre having ₹4 lakh reward on her head in Odisha, surrendered before Malkangiri Superintendent of Police Rishikesh Dnyandeo Khilari.

Ms. Sodi hails from Kusaraj village of Sukma district in Chhattisgarh. She was an area committee member of Katakalyan area committee under Darva division of Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee of the outlawed CPI(Maoist) organisation.

Fifteen former Maoist women cadres, who had surrendered in Malkangiri district in the past, were also invited along with their family members. These women were honoured for their courage to leave the path of violence and to work for development of their families and society.

Medical check-up

According to Mr. Khilari, these women were also given a free medical check-up for breast and cervical cancer at the Malkangiri district headquarters hospital.

Ms. Sodi had joined the Maoist organisation in 2012. She was involved in several incidents in Malkangiri and Chhattisgarh, and at least two murders in Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh.

According to her, she had decided to surrender mainly due to gender discrimination in the organisation as well as physical and mental harassment faced by the women cadres at the hands of their leaders.

She added that she was also impressed by developmental activities taken up by the Odisha government in remote areas of Tulsi reserve forest.

Ms. Sodi will be rehabilitated as per the surrender and rehabilitation scheme of the Odisha government. She will also get financial assistance to build own house, to pursue studies and get vocational training.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/u1n5xl/article31018697.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE09WOMEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/special-womens-day-for-former-maoists/article31018698.ece
275,2020/03/09,TMC govt. crossing limits on V-C’s resignation: Dhankhar,"‘The responsibility of decision on this should be left to the Governor’

West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said on Sunday that the State and Raj Bhavan must not get into each other’s territory on issues such as deciding resignations of vice-chancellors.

Being the Chancellor of the State universities, the responsibility of deciding the resignations of V-Cs should be left to the Governor, Mr. Dhankhar told reporters here on the sidelines of a programme.

“The State government has declared it will not accept the resignation (of the RBU V-C). This is not done. The State cannot take such a decision. This is crossing the limits of one’s domain. We must not get into each other’s territory,” he said.

“What has to be done by the Chancellor, leave it to him,” Mr. Dhankhar said, adding that he has not seen the resignation of the Rabindra Bharati University Vice-Chancellor.

Asked about Mr. Dhankhar’s comments, West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said the Governor had rightfully said so.

“The V-C (RBU) should remember he is not employed by Partha Chatterjee. In West Bengal, it has become the trend of V-Cs to go by the words of the Education Minister, even accompanying him to (anti-CAA) dharna (sit-in) manch,” Mr. Ghosh said.

Trinamool Congress leader and Health Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said the RBU V-C had clearly explained the circumstances behind his decision (to first quit and then withdraw the decision) before the media.

“I should not make further comment,” Ms. Bhattacharya said.

Controversy during fete

RBU vice-chancellor Sabyasachi Basu Ray Chaudhury had said on Saturday that he offered to resign following a controversy during the spring festival held on the campus. However, he changed his decision after talking to Education Minister Partha Chatterjee.

Some young men and women who took part in the spring festival on the campus on Thursday allegedly posed with offending words written on their bodies, photos of which went viral on social media and raised a storm.

Meanwhile, Kolkata police has set up a team to probe the matter.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/lxj6j5/article31018690.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE09GUV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/tmc-govt-crossing-limits-on-v-cs-resignation-dhankhar/article31018691.ece
276,2020/03/09,Teen activists begin empowerment drive,"Campaign includes promoting menstrual hygiene, gender equality in Odisha slums

Fourteen teenage girls from Odisha’s Berhampur have started a campaign ‘kishori shakti karyakram’ beginning from the International Women’s Day on Sunday to empower young girls living in slums of the city.

These activists are in the age group of 14 to 18 years. The campaign includes making adolescents and the community aware about menstrual hygiene, right age for marriage, motivating school and college drop-outs to restart studies, promoting gender equality, skill development and formation of adolescent groups.

Youth organisation, Youth for Social Development, has been training the activists for the past four months. They have already conducted a survey in 40 slums of the city to find out the problems and issues being faced by those living there.

According to YSD secretary Bibhu Prasad Sahu, four women students of Masters in Social Works course from Sambalpur University will join the campaign as interns from April and guide the activists.

Initially, the campaign was started in 33 slums but it will be extended to 40. As part of the campaign, ‘teen clubs’ are being established in the targeted slums. These clubs will have girls and boys as members.

Two activists — Sruti Kumari and Divya Bhanjani — said their first target is to help improve menstrual hygiene among the girls as well as teenage married women living in the slums. According to them, there are many superstitions related to menstruation and several girls and married women do not use sanitary napkins.

“Through the ‘teen clubs’ we will try to bring gender parity and also educate the youngsters about issues related with child marriage,” said Ms. Bhanjani. They will also motivate drop-outs to restart education. YSD will help in this effort. Others will be made aware about various means of skill development through government schemes, said Mr. Sahu.

The activists will be coordinating with Asha volunteers and Anganwadi workers.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/teen-activists-begin-empowerment-drive/article31018685.ece
277,2020/03/09,The gift of Aqua Gold,"Why this columnist’s skin looks and feels like a freshly-peeled egg

Every time I talk about a dermatological procedure, I receive a bit of flak. How could I, as a natural beauty expert, promote these therapies? However, for me, there’s no either/or. I love using raw honey as a cleanser and sea buckthorn oil is my holy grail product but I’m not averse to a quick laser. While loading up on your greens is non-negotiable, there are times when you need the dermatologist. Like the time I got a pea-sized zit in the middle of my forehead a week before the launch of my book. Dr Kiran Sethi of Isyaderm, Delhi, gave me a cortisone shot that instantly flattened it.

Still, the world of doctor’s office treatments is a slippery slope. But some treatments are so sublime that they deserve more than a second look. A full body laser was the best money I ever spent (ask for Soprano). For the face, I love a gentle laser, which doesn’t require the application of steroid cream after. Dr Meghna Gupta in Delhi introduced me to Clear Skin and AFT: both treatments refine pores, clarify and prevent breakouts. But these are baby variations. If you want dramatic change, there is ClearLift 4D, which works on clarity, lift, de-pigmentation and reducing wrinkles. Or Bobbi Brown’s favourite, PicoSure, which she says makes her look like she’s wearing foundation. These stronger ones do require a mild steroid cream, and cost over ₹25,000 per session. Steep, when compared to the first two that cost around ₹10,000 each.

As I step into my 40s, the focus shifts from pores and clarity to tightening and adding volume. A friend of mine, who entered her fourth decade a few years back, adopted PRP — platelet-rich plasma or the vampire facial. She calls it ‘the gift that keeps on giving’: her skin went from ashen to a radiant hot chocolate, without ever looking ‘done’.

For me ‘the gift’ has been the Aqua Gold facial. When Dr Sethi first told me about the therapy, I was sceptical but intrigued. Microneedling vitamins and peptides (wow), with PRP (yay), dermal hyaluronic acid (ok…), and a micro dose of Botox (yikes!). Nano gold, probiotics (especially good for those with rosacea), humectants and calming tea extracts were also in the mix.

I was alright with everything but the Botox. I didn’t want to look surprised 24/7, or become attached to something I’ve been studiously avoiding. But the doctor put me at ease, explaining how the tiniest amount is micro-needled into the skin’s surface, and not the muscle (which is what causes the unnatural lift and freeze).

The treatment itself involves the therapist stamping the infusion into the skin with a gold-plated roller with 0.5 mm needles. The tool also goes over your lips and lids, but it is pain free thanks to the numbing cream applied pre-procedure. Typically, people use no more than 1 ml of PRP — Dr Sethi uses around 3 to 5 ml so that you get an exponential stem cell boosting benefit, and have enough for face, neck, lips and under eyes.

Byrdie’s editoral director, Faith Xue, says the procedure made her skin tight and smooth, like a steamed dumpling. After trying it just before the Met Gala in 2018, Kim Kardashian remarked that she’d love to do it every month (even though it is only required once in three months).

While there is no doubt that I looked refreshed right after, the real magic unfolds a week later. As I write this column a month after, I feel like if you pierced my skin with a needle, a fountain of moisture would burst forth. I haven’t had a breakout, nor have I worn foundation. I can still move my brow and my skin is smooth like a freshly-peeled egg. Not that anything was wrong with my skin before, but I see just the subtlest difference, which changes everything. Like the perfect red lipstick, or the exact blend of fragrances, it is usually the little things that make an impact.

Would I try it again? Yes. It may not be something that I do regularly, but I will revisit it when my skin needs a boost.

Kunhalikutty, MP and national general secretary of the party, said that more secular forces would rally behind the stir against the new law that discriminated against people on the basis of religion. At the same time, the party would be cautious against any organisation trying to exploit the situation and communalise the issue.

No separatist slogans would be raised at the protests, which would be on a secular platform by raising the slogan ‘Save the Constitution’, he said.

Mr. Kunhalikutty said his party would hold meetings with voluntary organisations, especially minority communities involved in social, cultural and educational activities, ahead of an all-party meeting on Census called by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on March 16.

He said the State government had decided to implement the Census in Kerala. Since there could be some hidden factors in the Census, the whole enumeration process had to be studied in detail. Some of the questionnaire could led to the implementation of the proposed NPR and NRC. That was one of the concerns, he said.

The meeting, which was chaired by IUML State president Panakkad Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal, also criticised the police inaction in preventing the violence in Delhi. Even the media was not spared for reporting the truth, he noted.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/muslim-organisations-to-intensify-anti-caa-stir/article31025898.ece
279,2020/03/09,Dues to contractors to be paid soon: Minister,"Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran has said that the arrears owed to government contractors will be paid soon.

Inaugurating the Kankole-Cheemeni Road here on Monday, he said that when this government came to power, there were arrears totalling ₹300 crore and it was paid in a short time. “We expect the recession to slow down by April and we will be able to clear the arrears soon,” he said.

Mr. Sudhakaran said the panchayat and municipal roads in the State need improvement. Once the list of panchayat roads is received from the Local Self-Government Department, further action will be initiated, he said.

The LDF government had completed the construction of around 4,000 government buildings and 514 bridges so far during this tenure, he said.

280,2020/03/09,Bus shelters that serve no purpose,"Most bus waiting sheds in Kozhikode are in urgent need of facelift

A few senior citizens walk up to the ramshackle shed that doubles up as a bus shelter on Oyitti Road in the city on a sultry Saturday afternoon.

“Isn’t there a place to sit here?” asks Sharafuddeen of Puthiyappa as he glances the city buses that zoom past in front of him. “Go and sit there,” says one of the passersby, pointing his fingers at an adjacent bus shelter that is in a better shape thanks to the possible involvement of a corporate firm whose ads are pasted across the structure.

Cut to Mananchira in the heart of the city. The bus shelters in front of a prominent city school there do not have seating arrangements. If you go northwards to Nadakkavu on Kannur Road, another user ‘unfriendly’ waiting shed will catch your attention as rarely anyone uses it. There are no city buses on the swanky Gandhi Road that touches the Mini Bypass, but a bus shelter can be spotted at Asokapuram. Many people are found parking their vehicles next to it.

Examples such as these are a pointer to the unscientific and often short-term planning that goes into the construction of bus shelters in the city which fail to serve their purpose. There are waiting sheds where you cannot stand without holding an umbrella during the monsoon months. Summers are equally intolerable there as the scorching sun makes standing there an unbearable adventure.

Senior citizens and differently abled people often complain about lack of space in most “innovative” waiting shelters, where steel rods are used for sitting. During school hours, space crunch becomes more evident.

The authorities’ attempt to introduce new facilities too had come a cropper at many places. The Wi-Fi facility introduced at 12 locations around Mananchira some time ago were found to be vandalised by anti-social elements.

The vagaries of nature too played their part. Around ₹2.5 lakh was spent for their construction. While one of them was destroyed after a wayside tree fell on it, the rest were stripped off their aluminium panels, FM loudspeakers, and even the steel chairs fixed to the ramp. Spittle and waste paper litter the floor, and posters and graffiti stare you from the walls. The FM radio system introduced in some other locations too are not functioning now.

An official in the Regional Town Planning office said some bus shelters constructed under the City Road Improvement Project were indeed in a bad shape. The Regional Town Planner had pointed out in 2015 that the city needed bus bays in 33 locations. A study had been taken up in association with the National Institute of Technology-Calicut.

The recommendation was to set up modern bus bays which will have waiting sheds, FM radio, and lights and seating arrangements, along with a display of emergency services. The bays were to be constructed off roads so as not to obstruct traffic. Such a modern facility was opened outside the moffusil bus stand last year. Another one, albeit small in size, is going to come up at Ambalappady near Elathur. Two more are in the pipeline at Cheruvannur in the Beypore Assembly constituency, the official added.

T.V. Lalithaprabha, chairperson, standing committee on public works, claimed that the civic body had called for expression of interest for the upkeep of bus shelters in the city. “If the work is allotted to different players, it might lead to allegations of corruption. So, we thought of streamlining the whole thing,” she said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/mhlxr6/article31018093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09-KI-BUS-SHELTER-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/bus-shelters-that-serve-no-purpose/article31018097.ece
281,2020/03/09,Water supply schemes to be monitored for fair distribution,"GPS-fitted tanker lorries to supply potable water in drought-hit places

In line with the government directive, only tanker lorries equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) will be allowed to supply potable water this year under various schemes to be implemented by local bodies in drought-hit areas.

Revenue Department squads will closely monitor water supply, besides examining the daily supply details in the special log books kept at local self-government institutions.

Tracking made easy

The objective of using GPS-enabled vehicles is to prevent chances of fund diversion and ensure even distribution of water.

It will also help the district-level monitoring team clearly track locations.

As in the previous years, the panchayat authorities will submit review reports every fortnight to the district administration.

Details of local bodies that fail to comply with rules will be reported separately for action.

In case of administrative flaws, secretaries of local bodies will be primarily answerable to the district administration. The primary reason for strengthening surveillance is the allocation of huge funds every year by the government for drought relief work.

A few irregularities detected before the introduction of GPS-enabled tankers too were a reason for stringent surveillance measures.

Revision in allocation

Incidentally, a minor revision in allocation of drought mitigation funds is likely in accordance with demands from various local bodies. Last year, the Kozhikode Corporation was allowed to spend around ₹40 lakh for three-month-long drought mitigation projects.

For municipalities, the amount was ₹27.5 lakh. Grama panchayats were permitted to spend ₹16.5 lakh.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/j0su0q/article31018012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09-KI-WATER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/water-supply-schemes-to-be-monitored-for-fair-distribution/article31018013.ece
282,2020/03/09,Police offer ‘shelter’ to women complainants,"The exclusive mobile unit, the first to be rolled out in the State, to reach out to women in remote places

The city police on Sunday launched a mobile helpline project, Shelter, to reach out to women complainants who find it difficult to directly approach local police stations for various reasons.

Writer Khadija Mumtaz flagged off the special police vehicle under the innovative scheme, which was initiated to mark International Women’s Day.

Project coordinators said it was the first time in Kerala that such an exclusive mobile unit for directly receiving complaints from women was launched. The facility will be available in Kozhikode city police district throughout the year on an experimental basis. An extension of the service with the existing helpline - 9497923380 - will be considered on the basis of the number of complaints received, they added.

Deputy Police Commissioner A.K. Jamaludheen said the mobile unit comprising three women police officers would reach out to women staying in remote villages and colonies. He added that details of daily camping spots would be communicated in advance.

“If a particular case demands spot legal action, it will be taken up by the designated squad. They will also hand over cases to the local police stations concerned after studying the nature of petitions. All major cases involving attacks against women and children will be directly investigated by the Women’s Cell,” Mr. Jamaludheen said, adding that mediation or legal aid too would be made available to complainants through the cell.

Women’s Cell head K.M. Leela said complainants could locate the camping spots of the mobile unit by dialling 1515. “Apart from fixed spots, we will try to be present in places where women turn up to attend public events in large numbers. Also, we will set up around 50 complaint boxes in various parts of the city,” she added.

App launched

A special mobile application named Shecare was also launched by the Women’s Cell with the support of Qkopy Online Services in Kozhikode city. According to Women’s Cell officials, the app has a number of advanced features to send awareness alerts to women, besides informing of things to watch out for and helplines with real-time connectivity.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/pu7j6v/article31017985.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09-KI-SHELTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/police-offer-shelter-to-women-complainants/article31017986.ece

The helpline - 94899 19722, an initiative by the Superintendent of Police Varun Kumar to reach out to the people, is working well since November 2019.

Two days ago, when there was a call to the helpline, the police immediately alerted Kamudi Inspector Gajendran.

The information received was that a private computer centre indulged in downloading pictures and videos abusing child in various forms, which was against the law, circulating for a price in pen drive and other forms, including memory card.

After the police gathered inputs about the various outlets in the town, they zeroed in on a shop owned by Ponnirul, son of Kalimuthu, and his assistant identified as Vazhivitta Keezhavan of the same locality.

The shop - Palani Andavar Cell accessories and browsing centre, which was functioning near the Kamudi bus stand, allegedly downloaded pictures and sold them to youth in the area.

The SP warned of stern action and appealed to the public to make use of the helpline. The identity of the callers would be strictly confidential. However, the public, while sharing information about any illegal activity or smuggling, shall reveal with specific input for swift action.

The helpline, which has been welcomed by educational institutions as it came in handy for girl students, is popular among the parents as well.

285,2020/03/09,Cost imposed on petitioner for stalling power line project,"HC says the entire area requires high voltage electricity supply

MADURAI

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court imposed a cost of ₹10,000 on a petitioner for preventing authorities concerned from drawing a high tension electricity line over his land in Kanniyakumari district.

The court was hearing the petition filed in 2017 by K. Balakrishnan of Methukummal village in Kanniyakumari district. He had challenged the Collector’s order on installing a high tension line that was to go over his land.

It was said that the project was sanctioned to meet the electricity demands of the region. In 2017, the petitioner had obtained an interim order in the case that resulted in stalling of the project for three years.

Taking into account the larger public interest, Justice C.V. Karthikeyan observed that the authorities concerned, who had every right to draw the power line, had passed the order after giving the opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner and conducting an inspection on his land.

The court also took into account the fact that the petitioner had put up a temporary tin shade over his house only to prevent the electricity line from being drawn above.

“The entire area requires high voltage electricity supply. The petitioner cannot prevent that benefit being accrued to all households in the area... Therefore, he cannot claim as a matter of right that the line should not be drawn over his house,” the court observed.

Finding no merits in it, the court dismissed the petition. Taking cognisance of the fact that the project was stalled for three years, the court directed the petitioner to pay a cost of ₹10,000 to the Dean of Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, for the treatment of poor patients.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/cost-imposed-on-petitioner-for-stalling-power-line-project-madurai-high-court-kanniyakumari/article31025770.ece

For thousands of devotees visiting Sri Subramaniaswamy Temple in Thirupparankundram, the trip is incomplete without taking a dip in Saravana Poigai. Despite holding religious importance, the water in the pond is severely contaminated and is unfit for bathing.

As a measure to clean and restore the pond, Madurai Corporation is building eight toilets, 28 bathrooms for men and women and a common washing facility near the pond. Virudhunagar Member of Parliament B. Manickam Tagore and Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan were present during the bhumi puja function held on Monday.

The facilities, being built at an estimated cost of ₹44 lakh from Mr. Manickam Tagore’s constituency development fund, will cover an area of 4,500 sq. ft.

City Engineer S. Arasu said that the project was expected to be completed in the next three months. “After the completion of the project, devotees would be restricted from taking bath in the pond. They can only sprinkle the water on themselves,” he said.

While rainwater directly fills Saravana Poigai, water from Vaigai river, which reaches Thenkal Tank and travels through a system of cascading tanks, once used to reach the pond.

A Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department official said that devotees and many residents often washed clothes in the pond, causing water pollution. “Though we have been repeatedly telling them to stop using detergents, soaps and shampoos, our efforts have only turned futile. Hence, the construction of these facilities will curb pollution completely and restore the pond,” the official said.

Led by Centre president S.V. Stephen Raj, residents expressed their objection to revenue officials’ plan to divide the cremation ground into housing plots for distribution to beneficiaries.

The residents of the Centre were using the cremation ground near Narasinganallur for 30 years. However, the Department of Revenue had marked it for distribution to beneficiaries as housing plots and installed ‘marker stones.’ Hence, the Collector should intervene to put an end to the acquisition, Mr. Stephen Raj said.

Plea for borewell water

According to petitioners from Mela Ilanthaikulam, housing 600 families, they approached panchayat clerk Muthupandian with a plea for a borewell in their village as there was no drinking water supply to their hamlet. Although he agreed to sanction ₹40,000 for the project, Mr. Muthupandian said the amount would be released only if there was adequate supply of water in the borewell.

Subsequently, the villagers mobilised ₹49,000 to sink a borewell, which yielded adequate quantity of water to fulfil their requirements. Of this, ₹9,000 was borne by the residents and the rest by the village panchayat.

“However, the panchayat clerk did not take any step to lay distribution lines to bring water to our area. Instead, he took steps to take water from the borewell to residents living another area, who did not bear the expenses for sinking the borewell. When we questioned it, he verbally abused us and told us to submit a petition to the Collector if we have any objection. Besides transferring the problematic panchayat clerk, the Collector should instruct officials concerned to ensure distribution of drinking water to us as we have borne a portion of the project cost,” said P. Ulagan of Ilanthaikulam.

The petitioners also said the Collector should take steps to improve sanitary conditions in the village and instal streetlights.

Payment counter

A group of residents from Pattamadai submitted a petition in protest against the shifting of the electricity bill remitting counter from their hamlet to Cheranmahadevi. Since the residents had to travel to Cheranmahadevi to pay the bill, the facility should be reopened at Pattamadai itself.

She said her maternal uncle Ayyadurai’s land had been usurped by a person from the same area, who is now living in Mumbai and his son by creating forged documents and had sold the same to a person from Melapalayam.

“Since my maternal uncle and his wife, who do not have any children, have already passed away, the property was inherited by us as we are the legal heirs. However, the Mumbai-based person and his son have created fake documents to sell the property to another person from Melapalayam by registering it in the Sub-Registrar’s Office in Melapalayam.

“Despite not having vision, visually challenged persons have confidence in themselves. They are leading the way in a world full of darkness,” said Minister for Revenue and Disaster Management R.B. Udhayakumar here on Sunday.

He was speaking at a function organised by National Federation of the Blind to felicitate its national general secretary and senior advocate of Supreme Court S.K. Rungta for his service to the community over the last 50 years. The Minister promised that the State government will take all steps for the welfare and development of the community.

Senior members of the Federation also honoured Mr. Rungta for leading a case which resulted in a landmark judgement of the Supreme Court which guaranteed reservation of persons with disabilities for promotion in their job.

Explaining the significance of the judgement, Mr. Rungta said currently reservation of 4% was allowed for persons with disabilities only to direct recruitment. “But thousands of disabled people who have worked for many years have been denied promotion. Hence, this judgement is historic as it provides reservation for the disabled even for the promotion category,” he said.

The Department of Public Instructions has asked schools to advance the annual examination schedule so as to complete the process for classes 1 to 9 by March 23. Examinations for Class 7 and Class 10 would go on as per the schedule, the department has said.

Commissioner of Public Instructions on Monday issued the circular as a matter of precaution against COVID-19, directing schools across the State to complete the examination process for classes 1 to 5 between March 11 and March 16 and for classes 6 to 9 by March 23.

Deputy Director of Public Instructions, Dakshina Kannada, Malleswamy, said that all schools in the district have been asked to advance the examination schedule as per the circular of the department. There could be a little deviation from the dates to match the schedule of the school concerned, he added.

Confirming having received the circular, Principal of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Vidyamandir in Konchady Asha Priya said that the school has sent circulars to parents intimating them about the change in dates.

A passenger, who was found having fever following screening at the Mangaluru International Airport on his arrival, was moved to the quarantine facility at the Government Wenlock Hospital here on Sunday for COVID-19 tests.

District Health Officer Sikandar Pasha said that the passenger was screened on his arrival by a Jet Airways flight from Dubai at the airport as mandated by the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

As the airport did not have an ambulance readily available, one was sent from the city to bring the passenger to the hospital.

“He will be kept in the facility where all necessary tests will be carried out. If there are no symptoms of infection, he will be discharged on Monday,” Dr. Pasha said.

Following directions from the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation, all passengers arriving by international flights are being screened at airports.

298,2020/03/09,"Bring out facts too besides writing impartial reports,says Govind Karjol","Two-day State-level journalists conference comes to an end

Deputy Chief Minister Govind M. Karjol on Sunday urged journalists to come out with factual reports besides writing fearless and impartial reports.

He was speaking at the valedictory of the two-day State Level Journalists Conference organised by Karnataka Union of Working Journalists in association with Dakshina Kannada Union of Working Journalists here.

Perhaps Mahatma Gandhi could be termed as the first journalist of India, Mr. Karjol said and added that he [Gandhi] encouraged Indians to participate in the struggle for Independence through his articles. Realising that very few could read English, the Mahatma encouraged publications in regional languages. Through his Harijan, the Mahatma fought against untouchability, he said.

The Minister suggested that Karnataka Union of Working Journalists institute an award named after the Mahatma so that young journalists could know more about him.

Journalism should focus more on development issues; but development does not just mean industrial development. Other areas, including rural life and agriculture, too should be focussed upon and achievements in those areas need to be highlighted, Mr. Karjol said.

As against a demand by Karnataka Union of Working Journalists for ₹ 50 crore for journalists welfare, the government could provide only ₹ 5 crore this year. However, it would be enhanced in the coming years. Attempts would be made to provide free bus passes to rural journalists too, the Ministe promised.

He added that the government contribution of ₹ 25 lakh for Patrika Bhavans at district headquarters would be enhanced. The government would also support the construction of a Patrika Bhavan in Bengaluru, he said.

Earlier, the Minister and other dignitaries felicitated many journalists who were chosen for different awards by Karnataka Union of Working Journalists.

Senior journalists Thimmappa Bhat, Padmaraja Dandavathi, G.N. Mohan, Abbur Rajashekhar, P.N. Gopal Rao, Mahesh Angadi, Anand Shetty and U.P. Shivanand were felicitated for their achievements. Many journalists, including The Hindu’s Deputy Chief of Bureau, Bengaluru, B.S. Satish Kumar, received awards under different categories and endowments.

Member of Parliament Nalin Kumar Kateel, MLC Ivan D’Souza, the former Ministers B. Ramanath Rai and Krishna Palemar, Karnataka Union of Working Journalists president Shivanand Thagadoor, Dakshina Kannada Union of Working Journalists president Srinivas Nayak Indaje and others were present.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/bpd82g/article31018211.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09MNJOURNALISTSCONFERENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/bring-out-facts-too-besides-writing-impartial-reportssays-govind-karjol/article31018212.ece

State-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) have reduced the prices of sensitive petroleum products such as petrol by 24-27 paise a litre and diesel by 24-26 paise a litre across major cities as the price of international crude oil fell the most in a day since the Gulf war in the ’90s.

Petrol prices in Delhi decreased by ₹0.24 to to ₹70.59 per litre while diesel dropped by ₹0.25 to ₹63.26 per litre in Delhi, according to Indian Oil Corporation data.

In Mumbai, petrol prices were cut by ₹0.27 and are now retailing at ₹76.29 a litre. Diesel prices, on the other hand, stand at ₹66.24 a litre after witnessing a price cut of ₹0.26 from last changed prices.

Down ₹5 per litre

The prices of petrol and diesel have come down by about ₹5 a litre each since the beginning of this year.

In Kolkata, petrol was retailing at ₹73.28 a litre, down 23 paise compared with yesterday’s price of ₹73.51 a litre while a litre of diesel will cost ₹65.59, or 25 paise less than yesterday’s rate. Similarly, in Chennai, prices of petrol and diesel are ₹73.33 (25 paise less) a litre and ₹66.75 (26 paise decrease) a litre, respectively.

The prices of petrol and diesel are likely to come down further in the coming weeks as India follows the monthly average pricing of benchmark crude oil.

Experts see the Brent crude oil price fall as a blessing for the macroeconomy as India imports over 83% of its requirements. Shares of state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) surged on falling crude oil prices.

301,2020/03/09,We expect moratorium to be lifted by weekend: Yes Bank administrator,"We have full support of the Reserve Bank of India and the State Bank of India for liquidity, says Yes Bank administrator

Prashant Kumar, the RBI-appointed administrator of Yes Bank, says the bank will emerge stronger post moratorium. Edited excerpts from an interview:

How fast do you think the moratorium can be lifted?

According to the RBI notification, April 3 is the outer date. We are expecting that, by this weekend, we will be in a position [such] that the moratorium could be lifted. We are working towards that.

How serious is the problem?

This bank has two separate components. One is on the retail side and the other is on the corporate side.

What I have seen is, on the retail side, the bank is quite strong. They are having very good systems and processes besides customer connect. And, good technology also. NPAs are very low on the retail side, they are [also] having very good earnings. On the corporate side, they have not taken care of the concentration risk. Loans have been given to entities and unfortunately, all these entities have become non-performing assets (NPAs). They have not been able absorb it.

Is it limited to a particular sector or some entities?

It is concentrated to few entities — 5-6 entities are there.

That itself is very high, because it is not a very large bank. For a small bank, you give loans like ₹10,000 crore, ₹5,000 crore and then, if everything becomes NPA, you cannot survive.

For a small bank, it is good have more focus on the retail loan side but here, the focus was on corporate side.

Normally, for a good bank of this size, my feeling is it should be 65% retail and 30-35% corporate. Here, it was the other way round. Corporate here was 65%.

What is your primary focus?

My first focus is to bring back normalcy. Today, customers are facing a lot of difficulties because of the restrictions. Customers should be handled carefully. That is important. I cannot give them more than ₹50,000, but I can give them the assurance, I can empathise with the customers.

Several steps have been taken. Our ATMs were available within 24 hours. And, from Saturday night onwards, ATMs of other banks were also available. Today, we don’t have much rush in the branches because they can withdraw from ATMs. Today, none of our branches is facing any cash crunch. Not a single customer has been turned away today. We have also started processing requests from customers for emergency situations, like a medical condition where we can disburse up to ₹5 lakh.

How long will it take to start the NEFT?

NEFT inflows have started, so, somebody can send money. Earlier, that was also stopped. Because of the restrictions of not paying more than ₹50,000, we had to stop NEFT, RTGS etc.

What is the message to depositors?

First thing is, their deposits are safe and secure, they need not worry. Second, all of us are working to lift the moratorium so that they can do normal banking transactions.

Going forward, they are going to have a much stronger Yes Bank. So, there is no need to panic and shift deposits to other banks.

How healthy is the deposit franchise?

They were able to get deposits at a high rate. I would consider deposit franchise strong if you are able to raise liabilities at a market rate. But they were offering higher rate [on savings bank deposit]. On the liability side, we need to work more aggressively and raise the Casa [current and savings account deposit]. The Casa here is 30% but in other banks, the Casa would be more than 40%. We have to work on getting low-cost deposits and stable deposits.

Also read | Explained: Why did Yes Bank have to be bailed out?

What is the kind of liquidity support the bank is getting from the RBI?

We have full support from the RBI and the SBI for liquidity.

Depositors could rush to the bank after moratorium is lifted. What will be your strategy?

We have started reaching out to customers. The biggest comfort has come from the SBI. When SBI is investing equity, and they say they are behind Yes Bank, then I think the fear among depositors should not be there.

Maybe, we are in a problem but the solution has been worked out so fast. The moratorium was imposed on Thursday night, and the draft plan came within 24 hours. And, when we are saying moratorium will be lifted by the weekend, the central government, the RBI is absolutely behind this. When the resolution has come so fast, it shows the intention and commitment of the government and the RBI.

Do you think eventually Yes Bank will be merged with the SBI?

I don’t think that is a correct interpretation, not a correct reading of the situation. If that has been the case, it could have been done in the first instance.

How much capital would Yes Bank need now?

That, we would be able to share when we announce the Q3 results on March 14.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/8a7nu2/article31026146.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THBUYESBANK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/we-expect-moratorium-to-be-lifted-by-weekend/article31026147.ece
302,2020/03/09,COVID-19 outbreak could help agri exports: Agriculture Ministry analysis,"Ministry marks 21 products wherein India can grab part of China’s market share

In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Centre has identified 21 agricultural products, including honey, potatoes, grapes, soya beans and groundnuts, in which Indian exports could benefit from trade restrictions against Chinese goods.

The total value of China’s global exports of these products amounted to $5488.6 million in 2018. India exported $4,445.9 million worth of these commodities in the same period and could now have a chance to grab part of China’s market share.

“There may be opportunities for Indian exporters of agri-items, in case some countries impose restrictions on Chinese goods in response to outbreak of COVID-19. Opportunities may arise in case of other countries imposing import restriction on these tariff lines,” said an analysis of the impact of the virus outbreak on India’s agricultural trade, prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.

The report was submitted to the Finance Ministry last week, as part of a wider exercise to analyse the disruptions in global supply chains due to the COVID-19 crisis and chart a government response. Supply shortages and trade restrictions have already had a harsh impact on China’s total exports, which dropped more than 17% in January and February, in comparison to the previous year. Chinese imports fell 4% in the same period.

“There are 21 agri tariff lines where China’s global exports and India’s global exports are more than $25 million and where India is price and volume-wise competitive and capable to provide an alternative,” said the Agriculture Ministry analysis, seen by The Hindu.

Some of these products include natural honey, onions and shallots, chillis, potatoes, vegetables, guavas, mangoes, grapes, tamarinds, cashew apples, lychees, black fermented tea, spices, groundnuts, soyabeans, paddy, sesamum seeds, vegetable seeds for sowing and plants used in perfumery or pharmacy. Major markets which currently buy these products from China include Vietnam, USA, Japan, U.K., Philippines, Malaysia, Russia and Korea.

‘Won’t affect us’

The Agriculture Ministry has also said that the impact of the virus outbreak on import of agri items from China “may not affect us to an extent that may lead to any crisis”. India imported agriculture items worth $109.74 million from China in 2018-19, with seven products, including kidney beans, bamboo, cassia, fresh grapes, live plants and plums and sloes, accounting for 84% of that.

“The import of these items are likely to get impacted in case of supply disruption occurs in wake of COVID-19. However, it may be noted that out of the top seven items, only two items – bamboo and kidney beans – are imported in bulk from China in the sense that they respectively represent 35.5% and 41.2% import from China out of India’s total imports from the world,” the analysis stated. In the case of those two items, India is still striving for self-sufficiency through the Bamboo Mission and the National Food Security Mission.

With regard to Indian exports to China, two items — cotton linter and mango pulp — may get impacted, as they are used as raw material by China for further processing and then export. Apart from these two, most major items are used for domestic consumption in China and may not be too badly hit, said the Ministry analysis. India exported agricultural items worth $191 million to China during 2018-19, including capsicum, isabgol and cumin seeds.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/51rxv8/article31026023.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THBUCHINACHILLI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/covid-19-outbreak-could-help-agri-exports/article31026024.ece

At least four Asian refiners, including India’s HPCL and BPCL, plan to maximise purchases of April-loading Middle East crude after Saudi Arabia drastically cut its prices for term contract buyers, four sources at the refiners said on Monday.

Saudi Aramco on Saturday cut its selling price for Arab Light crude oil to Asia for April to a discount of $3.10 to the Oman/Dubai average, down $6 a barrel from the March price, its biggest-ever month-on-month price drop. The sources said they were still waiting for other Middle East producers such as Kuwait and Iraq to issue their official selling prices (OSPs), which are due by the 10th of each month.

The other West Asia producers are expected to cut their April crude OSPs to follow the trend set by Saudi Arabia.

“In Middle Eastern crude [prices], definitely there will be substantial softness, we will try to maximize to the extent possible,” said M.K. Surana, chairman of HPCL.

304,2020/03/09,Oil plunges as producers begin price war,"Suffers biggest daily rout since 1991 Gulf War; Saudi, Russia to raise production

Oil prices crashed on Monday, suffering their biggest daily rout since the 1991 Gulf War, after the collapse of an OPEC+ supply agreement that now threatens to overwhelm the world with oil, inciting panic throughout the energy sector.

Also read | Market mayhem: Sensex, Nifty log steepest ever one-day fall on recession fears

After failing to come to an agreement to cut supply, Saudi Arabia and Russia over the weekend pledged instead to ramp up production, which could quickly flood global markets with oil at a time when demand has already weakened substantially.

The market’s reaction has been furious, with crude futures plunging by nearly 20%, while energy stocks collapse as shale producers frantically cut future expenditures in anticipation of a drastically different outlook than a few days ago.

Brent crude futures were down $8.84, or 19.5%, to $36.43 a barrel by 20:19 IST. They earlier fell by as much as 31% to $31.02, their lowest since Feb. 12, 2016. Should these losses hold till end of day trade, it would be the biggest one-day percentage decline for both benchmarks since Jan. 17, 1991, the outset of the U.S. Gulf War, when it fell by a third.

A three-year supply pact between members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which includes the group’s top producer Saudi Arabia, and Russia fell apart on Friday after Moscow refused to support deeper oil cuts to cope with the outbreak of coronavirus.

OPEC responded by removing all limits on its own production, prompting fear of a supply hike in a market already awash with crude.

Also read | Viral economies: On coronavirus impact

Despite sliding demand for crude due to the coronavirus, Saudi Arabia plans to boost its crude output above 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in April after the current deal to curb production expires at the end of March, two sources told Reuters on Sunday. Saudi Arabia also cut its official crude selling price. The kingdom has been producing around 9.7 million bpd in recent months.

Russia, one of the world’s top producers alongside Saudi Arabia and the United States, also said it could lift output and that it could cope with low oil prices for six to 10 years.

The countries, along with several other producers, have cooperated for three years to restrain supply. The OPEC+ talks collapsed after OPEC effectively presented Russia with an ultimatum on Thursday, offering it a choice of accepting a deal with much bigger than expected cuts or no deal at all.

“The prognosis for the oil market is even more dire than in November 2014, when such a price war last started, as it comes to a head with the significant collapse in oil demand due to the coronavirus,” Goldman Sachs said. Saudi Arabia, Russia and other major producers last battled for market share in 2014 in a bid to put a squeeze on production from the United States, which has not joined any output limiting pacts and which is now the world’s biggest producer of crude.

The global outbreak of the coronavirus prompted OPEC to seek additional output cuts. More than 110,000 people have been infected in 105 countries and territories and 3,800 have died, the vast majority in mainland China, according to a Reuters tally.

China’s efforts to curtail the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted the world’s second-largest economy and curtailed shipments to the biggest oil importer. The International Energy Agency said on Monday oil demand was set to contract in 2020 for the first time since 2009. It cut its annual forecast by almost 1 million bpd and that the market would now contract by 90,000 bpd.

Major banks also have cut their demand growth forecasts. Morgan Stanley predicted China would have zero demand growth in 2020, while Goldman Sachs sees a contraction of 150,000 bpd in global demand. Bank of America reduced its Brent crude forecast from $54 a barrel to $45 in 2020.

“The radical shift in policy suggests that Saudi will allow inventories to build sharply over the next three quarters,” said a Bank of America Global Research report. “As a result, we now expect Brent oil prices to temporarily dip into the $20s range over the coming weeks.”",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/rj1j2b/article31025916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THBUOIL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/oil-plunges-as-producers-begin-price-war/article31025917.ece

Deposits at Yes Bank witnessed a steady decline during the March-September period last year as customers withdrew over ₹18,100 crore, in a reflection of falling confidence in the bank.

Data | The Yes Bank crisis explained in six charts

Yes Bank, which has been put under a moratorium by the Reserve Bank till April 3, during which customers are not allowed to withdraw more than ₹50,000, had deposits worth ₹2,27,610 crore at the end of March 2019 (or end of 2018-19 fiscal).

However, it fell to ₹2,25,902 crore by the end of the first quarter ended June of the current fiscal year (2019-20) and further to ₹2,09,497 crore by the end of the second quarter ended September of FY20.

The difference in deposits between March 2019 to September 2019, reflects withdrawals to the tune of ₹18,110 crore.

Data beyond September is not available as the cash-strapped bank had announced that there will be a delay in publishing its results for the third quarter.

A Delhi-based customer said that he sensed that all was not good with the private sector lender and withdrew his majority of deposits beforehand, leaving only with the minimum balance to keep the account active.

“We kept hearing that there was some problem with the bank, therefore we took out our money well before the withdrawal restriction was imposed on the bank,” he said on the condition of anonymity.

During the many months in the past, the bank battled hard to keep the rumour mongering at the bay, issuing statements that everything was fine and customers need not to worry about their deposits.

“Over the past few weeks, there has been a lot of unfounded speculation about Yes Bank’s board and management stability, asset portfolio, future growth prospects amongst other things.

“We strongly refute such speculations which we suspect is a deliberate and malicious attempt to create instability in the institution by undermining investor and client confidence. We have apprised the authorities of these developments. The financial position of Yes Bank is sound and stable and its liquidity and operating performance continue to be robust,” the bank said in a statement issued on July 8, 2019.

Another customer said he had limited deposits in Yes Bank and was not really worried much as the insurance amount has now been raised to ₹5 lakh.

“Even as I could withdrew ₹50,000 through cheque, I am not really worrying much as my account has limited cash. Moreover, the deposit insurance now covers up to ₹5 lakh from ₹1 lakh earlier, so there is not any such problem to me,” said Lalit Kumar, a Delhi-based Yes Bank customer.

A couple of other customers said they have pulled out all their money from the bank so there is nothing to worry for them.

However, a female customer reposed confidence and looked calmed, saying the government and the Reserve Bank have swung into action very swiftly and there is no need to worry.

She said she had come to the bank to withdraw the stipulated ₹50,000 through cheque and there was no such problem in doing that.

Even as the customers were hassled since last Thursday late evening, queuing up before the Yes Bank ATMs across the country, the bank has assured that their deposits are safe and they can withdraw the money both for their own and other banks ATMs.

During the moratorium period, Yes Bank will not be able to grant or renew any loan or advance, make any investment, incur any liability or agree to disburse any payment.

As per the RBI’s draft reconstruction scheme, State Bank of India (SBI) will pick up 49% stake in the crisis-ridden Yes Bank under a government-approved bailout plan by infusing capital of ₹2,450 crore.

Bank’s financial health is not sound as it has failed to raise enough capital under the new leadership of Ravneet Singh Gill, who took charge and Managing Director & CEO from March 1, 2019.

Troubles at new generation private sector started brewing up ever since the Reserve Bank denied extension to its co-founder Rana Kapoor — who now is in the custody of the Enforcement Directorate for financial mismanagement and money laundering charges — to continue as MD and CEO in September 2018 and had asked the lender to find a new successor.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday searched several locations in Mumbai in connection with a first information report registered against Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor on Sunday.

The FIR, which has been registered under sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act, names Mr. Kapoor’s wife, Bindu, and daughters, Roshni, Radha and Rakhee, as accused, along with Dheeraj and Kapil Wadhawan.

The Banking Regulations Act treats office-bearers of private banks on a par with public servants when public money is involved, and hence permits law enforcement agencies to invoke the anti-corruption Act against them wherever there are enough grounds to do so.

CBI officials said that searches were conducted at the offices of RKW Developers and Dewan Housing Finance Ltd. (DHFL), both owned by the Wadhawans, in Bandra East, at the office of DOIT Urban Ventures, owned by the Kapoors, on Elphinstone Road and at the Kapoor residence at the Samudra Mahal building in Worli.

“Inquiries so far indicate that from April to June 2018, Yes Bank invested ₹3,700 crore in short-term debentures of DHFL. Simultaneously, Yes Bank received a kickback of ₹600 crore in the garb of a ‘builder loan’ by DHFL to DOIT Urban Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary of RAB Enterprises of which Mr. Kapoor’s wife, Bindu, is a director and a 100% shareholder. Further, their daughters, Roshni, Radha and Rakhee, are 100% shareholders of DOIT through Morgan Credits Ltd,” a CBI officer said.

The officer added that the supposed loan from DHFL to DOIT was sanctioned on the basis of the mortgage of a sub-standard property with a very meagre value, on consideration of its future conversion from agricultural land to residential.

“Not only that the amount of ₹3,700 crore has not been redeemed by Yes Bank till date, the Bank also sanctioned another loan of ₹750 crore to RKW Developers, of which Dheeraj Wadhawan is a director. RKW is a company owned by the DHFL group which was created to oversee a construction project at the Bandra Reclamation project. However, the entire amount was transferred from RKW to DHFL without being invested in the project for which the loan was sanctioned,” the officer said.

Wall Street’s main stock indexes plummeted and the Dow Jones Industrials crashed 2,000 points on Monday, as a 22% slump in oil prices and the rapid spread of the coronavirus amplified fears of a global recession.

Trading on U.S. stock exchanges was halted immediately after opening, as the benchmark S&P 500 fell 7% to its lowest since June 2019, triggering an automatic 15-minute cut-out put in place after the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The energy index slumped 15.3% to its lowest level since August 2004 and crude prices were on track for their worst day in three decades as Saudi Arabia moved to significantly raise oil production after OPEC’s supply cut agreement with Russia collapsed.

“The lower it does go, the more people are likely to panic even further,” said Rick Meckler a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.

“Given the circuit breaker program, it’s more likely than not that selling won’t continue at this pace throughout the day, but the psychology of things is very much a herd mentality.”

The Indian benchmark Sensex witnessed on Monday its biggest single day fall in absolute terms amid a global sell off in equities on the back of rising concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and a plunge in crude prices that further fuelled worries about a global slowdown.

The benchmark Sensex lost a whopping 1,941.67 points or 5.27% to close at 35,634.95 — a 52-week low for the barometer — with all its 30 constituents ending the day with huge losses.

Incidentally, the Sensex has now lost 6,639 points or nearly 16% from its record intra-day high of 42,273.87 that was touched on January 20.

The broader Nifty plunged 538 points or 4.90% to close at 10,451.45.

More importantly, the India VIX index, considered a barometer of near-term volatility, jumped nearly 35% during intra-day trading to touch a new 52-week high of 34.4, before closing at 30.8 — 20.11% higher than Friday’s close.

“The Indian markets followed the global market meltdown which was triggered by rapidly spreading virus and free fall in crude oil prices,” said Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

The global crude prices were in a free fall mode registering the biggest drop since the Gulf War in 1991.

After falling to an intra-day low of around $27 per barrel, crude was trading at around $33 a barrel level — nearly 20% lower than previous day’s price — around 8 pm.

The fall in crude prices was primarily on account of the all-out price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. In the Sensex pack, the ONGC was the worst performer of the day, shedding over 16%.

This affected investor sentiments that are already down on account of the virus outbreak.

The dampened sentiments could be further gauged from the fact that trading at the NYSE had to be halted for 15 minutes as circuit breakers were triggered after the S&P 500 index had lost 7%.

“The relentless FPI selling in the last two weeks has added to the overall downtrend. There was panic globally as fears of rising cases of COVID-19 in countries like Italy and the U.S. made investors nervous. This has led to worries over a prolonged global economic slowdown,” said Mr. Khemka.

As per provisional numbers, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers at nearly ₹6,600 crore.

More than 2,200 stocks ended the day in the red as against only 327 gainers. In the Sensex pack, stocks like Reliance Industries, SBI, TCS, Tata Steel, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank all lost in the range of 5-13% each.

313,2020/03/09,"As Delhi burned, institutions looked away","If not urgently addressed and mended, the cessation of a constitutional state will destroy social trust

Children watch with frightened eyes as distraught mothers lament and mourn before people with cameras and notebooks. Proud working people are forced to depend on the charity of strangers who open their homes to them in kindness because the state refuses to create for them places of safety. The horror does not abate: fathers scour morgues for their missing sons, and mothers await with dread as bodies are dredged out of the putrid nallah.

I have never witnessed such an abysmal low in the trust of the citizen in her government. Muslim victims with bullet wounds lodged in their bodies or with many broken bones say they would rather die than go to a government hospital because of the contempt and neglect that they expect to encounter there. Victims turn away officials filling death and property compensation forms because they suspect the officials are secretly filling forms of the National Population Register to disenfranchise them.

Failure of the political class

Among the many public betrayals of the unfortunate survivors of the carnage, take first almost the entire political class. The ruling establishment criminally stoked and fuelled the hatred over the past several weeks, with venomous hate speech led from the top. Their political project was apparent — to crush the resistance to the citizenship project and the unprecedented display of unity and solidarity across religious identities of people in this movement across the country. The communal carnage was waiting to happen. But the remainder of the political class, who could have led the resistance to halt their tracks, did nothing to fight back. They abjectly lack the political conviction, the moral courage, and the cadres on the ground to resist in any way.

Delhi has the largest police force in any State or Union Territory outside Jammu and Kashmir. If it had the will, it could have prevented this violence or crushed it in a few hours afiter it broke out. The stark and frightening truth is that the communal carnage unfolded in Delhi because our elected representatives wanted it and the police allowed it. Even with a police force which is a small fraction of what is stationed in Delhi, no riot can continue for more than a few hours unless the state wishes it to.

Police response

There are many police images of this pogrom which should long rankle our conscience. Of thousands of desperate rescue calls made to the police going unanswered, as people were slaughtered and homes set alight. Of the police refusing to allow safe passage of ambulances ferrying the injured to hospitals, unlike even during a war between enemy countries. Of policepersons compelling a patient with bullet wounds to open his bandage four times at four different checkpoints to prove that he was actually injured even after the Delhi High Court in a midnight order directed the police to ensure safe passage and emergency treatment for those injured in the violence. Of policepersons standing by as mobs ravaged homes and shops of people of one religious identity, and sometimes a few even joining in. Of policepersons in riot gear tormenting a group of unarmed Muslim men, forcing them to sing the national anthem as they beat them with batons. The national anthem has become an icon of the protests against the citizenship law, so clearly the police were punishing them for the protests. Later, after one of these men died from police beating, the national anthem has become for me not just a song of love, but also of pain.

The midnight intervention by Delhi High Court Justice S. Muralidhar (who was later transferred) to order safe passage of ambulances, and his directions for considering immediate registration of FIRs against senior BJP leaders for hate speech, are a reminder of what role a conscientious constitutional court can play in a moment like this. Our citizen group had established a 24X7 control room to respond to distress calls. As the night progressed, the calls got more desperate and the police more criminally unresponsive. Gravely injured and lying in a small private hospital, 22 persons needed to be moved urgently to bigger hospitals, but mobs would not allow this, and the police refused protection. Two of them died. It was a midnight knock at the judge’s door which ensured not just the saving of the remaining lives, but of many more that terrifying night. The next day he gave police 24 hours to consider arresting all those who incited hatred. But after the court changed, this urgency evaporated.

The intensely communalised actions of the medical establishment raise equally troubling questions. Allegations of wanton obscuring of evidence in post-mortem reports require the entire medical fraternity to reflect on what has gone so worryingly wrong in injecting the poison of communal hatred in a profession of care and healing.

Nowhere in the picture

We have reached a point almost of amnesia about institutions like the National Human Rights Commission, the National Commission for Minorities, and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. Each is mandated to step in during moments like this when vulnerable minorities suffer discrimination and violence at the hands of the executive. But all of them are missing in action as Delhi burns and writhes in torment.

There is also a great deal that the State administration should have done. The rescue control room should have been set up and run by the state from the first night of the riots. The entire health machinery should have been mobilised, and the best medical treatment to victims assured. Large relief camps should have been established overnight as places of safety.

To lose in a few fevered nightmarish hours your loved ones, home, small business, and life’s belongings and savings is enough to ravage any of us. How much darker must be that desolation if you know that the violence was enabled by those duty-bound to protect you, and that among those who led the mob to your door were your own neighbours?

The carnage which engulfed the narrow lanes of working-class settlements of Delhi for three days signals the disgraceful and comprehensive collapse of every institution of the Indian state without any exception. If not urgently addressed and mended, this comprehensive cessation of a constitutional state will destroy hope, peace, social trust, development, the economy; and ultimately the possibilities of our becoming one day a country of kindness and justice.

314,2020/03/09,Turning younger and dynamic,"Many things about the Congress need to change, but on the table now is the selection of RS nominees

Elections to 55 seats in the Rajya Sabha (RS) from 17 States are scheduled to be held on March 26. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) holds 15 of the 55 seats, and it is estimated that it will retain 12 of them. The Congress holds 11 seats which could go down to nine. This round of elections is unlikely to alter the fortunes of the Centre, which has managed to pass legislation in the Rajya Sabha though it has no majority there, but it will have a bearing on the Congress’s plans for the future, assuming that it has some.

Also read | TMC announces four MPs for Rajya Sabha election

The BJP has been shrewd in allotting its RS berths to a mix of organisational people and ideologues but never failing in making the most ruthless assessment of their utility. So much so that even RSS pracharaks Ram Madhav and P. Muralidhar Rao, deputed as general secretaries, have not been accommodated despite their legitimate claims, while several lesser known figures have made the cut. The uncompromising age bar set at 75 has also allowed the BJP to bring to the fore a new generation of lawmakers to the RS.

Lack of fresh thinking

On the other hand, the Congress has been rather aimless, if not outrightly beholden to vested interests in its distribution of RS tickets, historically. The names doing the rounds as potential Congress nominees for the handful of seats that it could secure are of old warhorses and dynasts — indicating no fresh thinking, if true. There are several things about the Congress that need to change urgently, but what is now on the table is the selection of RS nominees.

Ideally, the Upper House contingent of any party must be a mix of experts who do not have the skillset and time to nurture a Lok Sabha constituency but can make critical contributions to legislative discussions and policymaking in general and organisational talents who should not be bound to a particular constituency but freed up for a wider political function. So, it might be justifiable that Manmohan Singh, P. Chidambaram and Jairam Ramesh get a berth in the Upper House, but unfathomable that Motilal Vora, 92 and barely able to walk, is being considered for renomination yet again. In fact, the Congress’s leadership has been reduced to a group of those who cannot walk, and those who do not walk because they don’t need to due to their privileged status as inheritors of power and wealth. Pushed to the margins by anti-elite mobilisations of various hues, the Congress has no option but to respond to popular sentiment and turn younger, diverse and dynamic.

Being able to walk the talk

It is now clear that the Congress cannot grow without reviving its fortunes in U.P. and Bihar, two States that elect 120 members to the Lok Sabha. Unless the party has a strategy for the heartland, now totally captured by the BJP, its future is bleak and the gains made in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh in 2018 could soon be lost. The party would do well to take into account a roadmap for the heartland while drawing up its list for the Rajya Sabha.

The Congress party, even in its current scrawny phase, has an array of leaders with the capacity to work hard and who are connected to the ground. But they are always demoralised and ignored. Positions of power have been shared among a select few in the social and economic elite. The Congress needs to signal to the middle rungs of the party that effort, commitment and capacity will be valued and rewarded. Seniors who were effective and inspiring at one point must acknowledge the fact that they cannot do that anymore. It is a law of nature, but in the current phase, also a character of politics that has become highly competitive and unforgiving. Nominating those who can and are willing to walk, from among the party’s own rank and file, will go a long way in raising hopes for the Congress in this season of despair.

315,2020/03/09,Having an ear to Adivasi ground,"Policy framers must recognise their wide diversity in order to address their different problems

In November 2018, the Adivasis of Jhargram, West Bengal, were overtaken by an event while preparing for the Bandhna festival; seven adults of the KhariaSavar community died within a span of just two weeks. Their lifespan is approximately 26 years less than the average Indian’s life expectancy. Their lives are full of uncertainties, and death is considered the most normal of happenings.

The dead were cremated without any autopsy being performed, and thus the cause of the deaths could not be medically verified. Other villagers were of the view that those who had passed away were suffering from tuberculosis. The opinion of the State authorities was this: “It was not undernourishment. They died of tuberculosis and excessive drinking.” What is intriguing, however, is the factor of alienation that emerges from this.

Despite the village’s proximity to several public offices such as the panchayat, block and district headquarters, being surrounded by other ethnic groups with better access to information, and even economically connected with relatively advantaged neighbours, the real reasons that caused the deaths hardly drew any public attention. Surveillance by the administrative authorities over the population in all other matters of their lives had failed to detect anything about the catastrophe until a few surviving inhabitants of the village made a plea to rescue them from hunger and diseases.

Misplaced views

The uncertainty of Adivasi life has a strong connection with the ‘mainstream’ view about them. In popular discourse, the socio-economic disadvantages of the Adivasis as compared with the rest of the population are often seen through a lens of benevolence. The views about the ‘underdevelopment’ of the Adivasis typically subscribes to this section of the population being the ‘takers/receivers’ of governmental benefits. Policies and practices rooted in this approach, fail, in most cases, to accommodate the question of the participation of the Adivasis in the ongoing processes of the nation as co-citizens. This in turn not only deprives the Adivasis of the socioeconomic progress they are capable of but also results in a loss to the rest of the nation.

The rich moral, cultural and social values, and linguistic and other practice-acquired developments that the Adivasis have been nurturing throughout history could have added immensely toward strengthening our democracy. Mutual co-operation, decision making through discussion, peaceful co-habitation with others and with nature, age-old and time-tested practices of environmental protection, and other such high civic qualities observed by them could have added to the country’s “democratic curriculum”. However, the politics of dominance, economics of immediate gain, and a social outlook of separateness have charted a very different path for the Adivasis.

Study finds a knowledge gap

We were part of a study conducted by the Asiatic Society and the Pratichi Institute among 1,000 households across West Bengal (“Living World of the Adivasis of West Bengal: An Ethnographic Exploration” — https://bit.ly/39yWWUb). The study found that there exists, both in the public and academic domains, a wide gap in knowledge about this selectively forgotten and pragmatically remembered population.

Who they are, where they live, what they do, what their socio-economic status is, what their cultural and linguistic practices are, are all questions to which the prevailing answers are fragmented and vague. For example, in West Bengal, there are 40 Adivasi groups notified by the government as Scheduled Tribes (STs), but most people use the terms Adivasi and Santal interchangeably. Santal in fact, is but one of the 40 notified tribes forming 47% of the total ST population.

This knowledge gap leads to democratic denial for the Adivasis. The imposed superiority of the outside world has resulted in the Adivasis considering themselves as inferior, primitive and even taking a fatalistic view of their subjugated life. This pushes them to the margins, even making them abandon some of their socially unifying customs and cultural practices — particularly democratic norms and human values that have evolved through a protracted journey of collective living and struggles for existence.

One outcome of this is the erosion of their great linguistic heritage (in some sections). However, Adivasi acceptance of the ‘imposed modern’ does not guarantee their inclusion in the apparent mainstream. Rather, the opposite happens. They are often reminded of their primitive roots and kept alienated. Again, pushed to the side by exploitation and oppression, marginalisation and subjugation, Adivasis, in many cases, cling to oppressive behaviours such as witchcraft which only make the label of them being primitive even more indelible. The vicious cycle of political-economic deprivation and social alienation continues to keep them subjugated to the ruling modern. A situation where they are a source of cheap labour and live lives where they are half-fed with no opportunities to flourish and develop their human capabilities seems unalterable.

Therefore, it is important to go beyond the administrative convention of bracketing Adivasis into a single category. Rather, policy framing requires mandatory recognition of their wide diversity so as to address the different problems faced by different groups — by community as well as by region. It is also important to abide by the general constitutional rules which are often violated by the state. In other words, the very common instances of violations of the Forest Rights Act, the Right to Education Act, and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act — which affect them — have to be eliminated. The possibility of fair implementation of public programmes, however, is contingent to an agentic involvement of the communities concerned. Instead of being considered to be mere passive recipients, Adivasis must be respected as active agents of change and involved in all spheres of policy, from planning to implementation.

It is imperative that the entire outlook on the Adivasi question is reversed. Instead of considering Adivasis to be a problem, the entire country can benefit a great deal by considering them as co-citizens and sharing their historically constructed cultural values which often manifest the best forms of democracy and uphold the notions of higher levels of justice, fairness, and equality — better than those prevalent in seemingly mainstream societies. By ensuring their right to live their own lives, the country can in fact guarantee itself a flourishing democracy.

Few things cast a long shadow on human failing as much as sex selection does. To choose on the basis of gender and eliminate new life if the gender is not ‘favourable’ can easily be among humanity’s worst moments. Last week’s case of infanticide in Tamil Nadu’s Usilampatti, historically notorious for its crude methods of killing female babies, sent a chill down the spine of the country. Years after it was believed that awareness generation and targeted behaviour change communication had led to people giving up the inhuman practice of feeding female infants with the toxic milk of a local herb, the news that a couple had reportedly used the same method to kill their second girl child, just a month old, had child rights activists wringing their hands in frustration. Chekkanoorani, a suburb near Usilampatti, in Madurai district, was the scene of the crime, where police arrested a young couple and the paternal grandfather of the child for having fed the 31-day-old with the toxic juice, killing her. This is no isolated case in a nation of missing girls. Data on sex ratio at birth (SRB) culled from the Civil Registration System, show an alarming fall over the years. From 903 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2007, it dropped to 877 in 2016.

Four States have an SRB equal to or below 840: Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan (806), Bihar (837), Uttarakhand (825) and Tamil Nadu (840). Activists point out that while infanticide may have come down, sex selective abortion at scan centres continues as the preferred vehicle for parents (and grandparents) obsessed with son preference. This despite the fact that the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act was enacted and amended to arm the state to wage a war against this pernicious practice. The Centre’s ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ campaign aimed at saving girl children has a huge unfinished task in front of it. Tamil Nadu, at one stage under the leadership of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, effectively employed the Cradle Baby Scheme to counter infanticide, along with effective awareness campaigns. The cradles are still there, and the babies are coming too, but the SRB has been steadily dropping since 2011. It is time again for the government to ramp up awareness building exercises, and this time use technology to monitor every single pregnant woman right down to taluk levels until at least one year after birth. While punitive aspects might offer a measure of deterrence, true change can only be brought about by a change in attitude. As Amartya Sen argued: while at birth boys outnumber girls, ‘after conception, biology seems on the whole to favor women’. The weapon that the government needs to use now is one that will be powerful enough to eliminate the perversion of son preference from people’s minds.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/missing-at-birth/article31016859.ece
317,2020/03/09,House matters: on restoring democratic majesty of Parliament,"The govt. must be more accommodating to the Opposition in Parliament

The government’s stubborn refusal to allow an immediate discussion on Delhi’s communal conflagration, in February, as demanded by the Opposition, has brought Parliament to a gridlock. The violence, that claimed more than 50 lives, took place when the Budget session was on a 15-day recess. The altercation over a suitable timing for a discussion on the issue has heightened the hostility between the treasury benches and the Opposition. The government took the position that the discussion could be allowed only after the situation calms down further. Outnumbered and denied a hearing, Congress members resorted to disruptive tactics which led to the suspension of seven of them for the rest of the session. The punishment is perhaps too harsh — in the puzzling parallel drawn by the party leader, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, like sending a pickpocket to the gallows. Speaker Om Birla has stayed away for three days, upset over the behaviour of MPs and also over the hurried decision in his absence to suspend the seven. A discussion will take place this week, and an all-party committee announced on Friday might help resolve the logjam. But a country that is facing many challenges and which requires all hands on deck can ill-afford such disruptions and suspensions.

Elected to Parliament in 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had genuflected at its gate as a mark of respect, and termed it the temple of democracy. His government’s approach towards the Opposition and parliamentary proceedings has not been in the best spirit of democracy, however. The BJP has a track record of disrupting Parliament when it was in the opposition, but in power, it has taken an unyielding approach towards demands from across the aisle. Its unassailable Lok Sabha majority has been turned into a defence of majoritarian instincts. The Congress has been denied the post of Leader of the Opposition on a technical ground. The Rajya Sabha, where it has no majority of its own, has been often bypassed by arbitrarily labelling legislation as finance bills, which constitutionally do not require its approval. Debates on far-reaching legislation such as amendments to the constitutional status of Jammu and Kashmir have been hurried. While the PM and Home Minister Amit Shah took charge in persuading friendly Opposition parties on crucial RS votes, there is an evident and troubling disinclination to engage the Opposition on matters of national importance as a regular practice. The Parliamentary Affairs portfolio that used to be handled by a political heavyweight engaging all parties is now reduced in stature. The Speaker’s traditional non-partisan role in ironing out conflicts with the Opposition is also being undermined by the combative troops on the treasury benches. The Deputy Speaker’s post, which usually goes to the main Opposition party, is vacant. The government must make amends and restore the democratic majesty of Parliament.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/house-matters/article31016850.ece
318,2020/03/09,Legislators’ local area development funds to be released immediately,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Monday assured the legislators that the remaining funds towards the legislators’ local area development (LAD) funds would be released immediately.

In his reply to the Governor’s speech in the Legislative Council, he said he would issue orders for the immediate release of the funds.

The issues was raised by several MLCs, who said that nearly ₹450 crore towards the LAD funds was yet to be released, and that the Council members were yet to receive ₹1.5 crore out of the ₹2 crore for this financial year. “The fund would lapse if the money was not released this year,” JD(S) member K.T. Srikante Gowda said.

In his reply, Mr. Yediyurappa said that ₹700 crore was available, and that he would immediately release it.

Which party is ‘zero’?

In a friendly banter, Leader of the Opposition S.R. Patil said the ruling BJP would be “zero” without Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, which was opposed by the BJP members in the Legislative Council.

BJP member Pranesh said there was no question of zero in the BJP. “When Atalji [former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee]was there, he was our hero and now Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a hero. Likewise, Mr. Yediyurappa is our hero here,” he said.

Adding to it, another BJP member Tejaswini said it was true that the Congress without Siddaramaiah or the Janata Dal (Secular) without H.D. Deve Gowda and H.D. Kumaraswamy would be zero. Later, when Mr. Yediyurappa was replying to the Governor’s speech, the Opposition benches tried to embarass BJP members by asking them the question again.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/legislators-local-area-development-funds-to-be-released-immediately/article31026412.ece
319,2020/03/09,State will seek funds from Centre for UKP: Chief Minister,"‘Why wasn’t project given priority in last six-and-a-half years’

Amid criticism that the government did not accord importance to the Upper Krishna Project (UKP) in the State Budget, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who announced ₹10,000 crore for the project after the Budget presentation, on Monday assured the Legislative Council that he would try to expedite the project in the coming years by seeking funds from the Centre.

“I will seek funds from the Centre and urge them to give priority to the project,” he said in his reply to the Governor’s speech.

Responding to the Leader of Opposition S.R. Patil’s demand to earmark ₹25,000 crore annually for the next three years to complete all UKP works, the Chief Minister asked, “Why was UKP not given priority in the last six-and-a-half years? Without doing anything in your time, you are providing a suggestion,” he said. He said that land in 20 villages has to acquired and lives of people has to be rebuilt.

‘Accord priority ’

Earlier, Mr. Patil said that to complete the mammoth project, the government should accord priority by allocating ₹25,000 crore annually for three years. He also said that the State government, which has completed the first and second phase of the project, should not wait for funds from the Centre by seeking a national project status. “Twenty-two villages will be submerged, and 1.3 lakh acres and about 25,0000 structures will have to be acquired. Once the project is completed, people in Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Raichur, and Koppal in Kalyana Karnataka region, and Bagalkot, Vijayapura, and Gadag in Bombay Karnataka region will benefit,” said Mr. Patil, who will himself lose his house in Bagalkot owing to acquisition.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/state-will-seek-funds-from-centre-for-ukp-chief-minister/article31026385.ece
320,2020/03/09,Adugodi blast: BBMP to send notice to BMRCL,"Company had allegedly dumped construction debris in the site

The site at Dairy Circle, Adugodi, where a 50-year-old man sustained serious injuries to his leg after a minor blast on Sunday, was filled with construction debris allegedly dumped by the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL). The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Monday said that it would serve notice to the BMRCL.

The explosion is suspected to have been caused by a chemical reaction of elements in the pile of garbage and construction debris. The victim, Narasimhappa, had to undergo a below-knee amputation at the Sanjay Gandhi Institute of Trauma and Orthopaedics Hospital, and is currently in the ICU.

Sources at the hospital said it was the only way to save his left leg. “We are monitoring him carefully in the ICU. As of now, he is out of danger,” a doctor said and added that when the victim was brought to the hospital, he was bleeding profusely leading to complications.

Mayor M. Goutham Kumar and BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar visited the spot on Monday. They directed officials to identify and take strict action against those who carelessly abandon chemicals in public places. After visiting Narasimhappa in hospital, the Mayor also said that the civic body would pay the hospital expenses.

The Adugodi police have registered a case of negligence. They are waiting for the forensic report. “The State Forensic Science Laboratory authorities have taken samples of the chemicals. Based on the results of the tests, we will take further action against the culprits,” said a senior police officer.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/adugodi-blast-bbmp-to-send-notice-to-bmrcl/article31026198.ece
321,2020/03/09,"₹10,000 penalty on parking contractor","He was found guilty of fleecing a customer

The Indian Railway Stations Development Corporations Limited has slapped a penalty of ₹10,000 on a contractor for allegedly cheating a person who had parked his motorcycle in the parking lot of Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna City Railway Station earlier this month.

The action was taken after the motorcyclist posted a complaint on Twitter. He alleged that on March 2, he had gone to the railway station to drop his friend. He got an entry ticket stating that the parking facility is free for 7 minutes after which he will be charged ₹15 every five minutes.

However, when he went to reclaim his motorcycle after seeing his friend off, he was asked to pay ₹100 even though he had parked the two-wheeler for around 20 minutes.

After investigating, the Divisional Railway Manager of South Western Railway (SWR) posted a message on social media that the allegation was true.

The contractor has been directed to pay the penalty amount in seven days, and refund the excess amount charged from the complainant. The SWR has warned the contractor of terminating the contract if he continues to flout the rules of the agreement.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/10000-penalty-on-parking-contractor/article31025934.ece
322,2020/03/09,HC issues contempt notice to BBMP Commissioner,"It is in connection with the failure to start a survey of illegal constructions

The Karnataka High Court on Monday ordered issue of a show cause notice asking Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him for not commencing survey of illegal buildings in the city even five months after a direction from the court.

Though the BBMP counsel on Monday told the court that the survey would commence on April 1, the court did not appreciate the statement as the BBMP had not commenced survey though the court had passed an order in November 2019.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi issued the direction during the hearing of a PIL petition, initiated suo motu by the High Court, on the issue of illegal constructions and inaction of the BBMP in initiating action against such structures.

The bench noted that the direction was issued to the BBMP Commissioner in November last year to submit a time schedule on December 18, 2019 for commencing the survey. The bench noted that though the BBMP has now stated that the survey would commence on April 1, no reason has been assigned as to why the order passed in November was not implemented.

“We expected the survey to start immediately. However, it was stated that the survey will start on April 1. There is no explanation for the delay. In more than one case, there was clear defiance of court orders. This court restrained from initiating proceedings under contempt of court proceedings once,” the bench observed while adjourning further hearing till March 31.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hc-issues-contempt-notice-to-bbmp-commissioner/article31025737.ece
323,2020/03/09,Doddabelavangala residents demand closure of waste processing plant,"Allege that it is being mismanaged and contaminating their water sources

Many community members from Doddabelavangala have been protesting since Friday demanding that the civic body close the waste processing unit in their village on the ground that it is being mismanaged and contaminating their water sources.

They also demanded that the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) scrap plans to revive another processing plant, near Doddaballapur on the outskirts of the city, by setting up a waste-to-energy plant.

Protesters, on Monday, boycotted a meeting with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and civic officials, and continued their indefinite strike. Last week, residents had submitted a memorandum to BBMP’s Joint Commissioner (Solid Waste Management) Sarfaraz Khan demanding that any plans to revive the processing plant near Doddaballapur be scrapped.

Govindaraj from Doddabelavangala claimed that the community had protested against mismanagement at the plant, forcing the then State government to order closure of the unit in 2016.

Chandra Tejaswi, secretary, Karnataka Pranta Raita Sangha, Bengaluru Rural district, alleged that instead of processing waste, only mountains of waste were created. “The then Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had assured us that the accumulated waste would be processed. Nothing has been done so far,” he said, and claimed that the private company responsible for running the waste processing unit in Doddabelavangala was not following the standard operating procedure.

“This area is the catchment for the Byragondalu dam that is around 5 km away. The dam is part of the Yettinahole water project. Already, water sources here are contaminated due to leachate from the plant,” he said.

BBMP officials admitted that the civic body was exploring options to enhance its processing capacities in view of the observations made by the Karnataka High Court recently. The HC had observed that the BBMP did not have adequate processing capacities.

An official claimed that the proposal to set up a waste-to-energy plant is still at a discussion stage.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar, accompanied by CM’s Political Advisor and Yelahanka MLA S.R. Vishwanath, is likely to visit the village on Tuesday to convince the community members to withdraw their indefinite strike. Mr. Anil Kumar had earlier visited the village to convince the community members to withdraw their strike, but to no avail.

Three waste processing units not receiving daily loads

Every day, the civic body used to send around 180 trucks carrying around 500 tonnes (200 tonnes of mixed waste and 300 tonnes of segregated, wet waste) to the Doddabelavangala plant alone.

However, senior BBMP officials said that this is no longer the case on account of the protest.

At present, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is unable to send garbage to three waste processing units. Some of the waste is currently being diverted to another unit, but most is being sent to the landfill at Mittaganahalli.

Since Sunday, waste is not being sent to Kannahalli and Seegehalli processing plants. This is because a convention of the RSS is being held in the area.

“We had received a request from the organisation to temporarily not send waste to the processing units till the end of the convention. The waste will be sent only after March 17,” an official said.

The BBMP is unable to divert the segregated waste completely to the remaining processing units for fear of protests by communities living around these plants.

“Most of the garbage is now being dumped in the landfill at Mittaganahalli,” the official said and pointed out that the Bellahalli quarry pit was recently closed.

The official added that the BBMP had no other option, as with the onset of summer, the threat of communicable diseases was looming. Already, the BBMP has been firefighting to control the spread of cholera, besides creating awareness about Covid-19.

“Cleanliness is key to check the spread of communicable diseases. This is why most of the garbage from the city is cleared and is being dumped in the Mittaganahalli landfill,” the official explained.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/euidml/article31025593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGPROTESTAGAINSTWTEPLANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/doddabelavangala-residents-demand-closure-of-waste-processing-plant/article31025594.ece
324,2020/03/09,Traffic Police Park for children gets a new look,"Traffic police intend to create road safety awareness among children by providing practical experience

When is it safe to cross a road? What is the purpose of zebra crossings? Now, children will get to understand how to follow road rules at the newly renovated Traffic Police Park near SBI Circle, which was inaugurated on Monday.

With this initiative, the traffic police intend to create road safety awareness among children by providing practical experience. The park has newly-constructed pathways with road-like markings, traffic signals, and signboards. In addition, the police have put up traffic rules around the play area for children.

“We plan to train at least 50 students every day in the park and shape them into responsible citizens,"" said Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner of Police, Traffic. School managements and parents can collaborate with the traffic police and use this park to educate students.

Walls have been painted with traffic-related artwork. Children will be able to cycle in the park.

“There will be eight to 10 cycles that children can use while at the park. We wish to teach students the importance of zebra crossings and traffic signals,” said a police officer.

The traffic police had set up the Traffic Police Park in 2004. While it was operational, they used it to spread awareness among 50,000 students. However, over the years, it fell into disuse.

Home Minister Basavaraj Bommayi, who inaugurated the park, said, “I believe that educating students regarding traffic rules is important since what we teach them at a young age stays in their mind for a long time.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/b747xn/article31025327.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGCYCLEPARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/traffic-police-park-for-children-gets-a-new-look/article31025328.ece
325,2020/03/09,School suspends classes following COVID-19 rumours,"Following rumours that a parent of a child tested positive for COVID-19, The Deens Academy on Monday decided to suspend classes for all classes of the school until further notice. The Health and Family Welfare Department, however, denies that a positive case has been reported in the State.

Shanthi Menon, Principal, said that it was unfortunate that a mail that was meant for internal communication was leaked on social media. “I sent this mail to ask my teachers to be calm and not to over-react to the situation. I had received a mail from the parent who said that he was in the high risk category for COVID. He and his family will be on quarantine and therefore sent out this mail,” she said. The school was supposed to close for summer vacations on March 31.

Asked why she had stated that a patient was screened positive for coronavirus in her email, she said it was based on rumours spread in the school. “One internal mail was misinterpreted and circulated that created unnecessary panic,” Ms. Menon said.

The school has around 1,700 students and 160 teachers. The school management stated that it was taking all precautionary measures and the classrooms were washed with Dettol every day. Besides sending mails to parents not to send their children to school if they had cough, cold or fever, she said that the students were also screened everyday at school.

Confusion regarding holiday

As a precautionary measure, the Department of Public Instruction late on Sunday night had announced that all pre-primary classes of government, aided and unaided schools would be suspended until further notice. While some school managements sent messages to parents in the morning stating that it was a holiday, many parents learnt about it only after reaching the school. Several working parents had to make alternative arrangements for their children. “My child’s day care has also said that it would be closed and I will have to skip work to take care of my child,” said Prajwala S., parent of a five year old.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/school-suspends-classes-following-covid-19-rumours/article31022961.ece

327,2020/03/09,"International Women’s Day: For women, by women police officers","Initiatives include helping common citizens reclaim public spaces and filing complaints, and guiding personnel on coping with menstruation and pregnancy while on duty

Maintaining law and order is their primary mandate, but the the city police – led by women officers – have been taking up initiatives to help women citizens reclaim public spaces, be fearless about opening up and filing complaints, and also help women police personnel cope with menstruation and pregnancy while on duty.

“This is the need of the hour. We are trying to help women get the freedom to walk freely and fearlessly in public places,” said Nisha James, DCP (Administration).

This week, walls at public places were painted white with messages written on them to inspire women and children to walk without fear and hesitation as a part of the ‘walk free’ initiative launched jointly by the National Commission for Women and the city police. The messages contain a guide to ‘unapologetic walking’ and also awareness about various forms of sexual harassment.

Isha Pant, former DCP, South East, and presently deputed at the command centre, had launched a dedicated police team comprising men and women to perform skits and street plays to create awareness on women’s rights. This opened up a series of interactions where women could open up about their woes. With the inputs gathered, Ms. Pant launched the ‘safe hangouts’ initiative for women at eight places in her division.

The police, with the help of civic agencies, provided basic infrastructure that was required for the initiative.

In South division, DCP Rohini Katoch Sepat launched the ‘Aache banni’ programme by organising friendly games for women with women police personnel. Ms. Sepat also launched the ‘Akka thayi’ programme for working women of the unorganised sector to redress their concerns.

Acknowledging that many women are scared to come forward to file a complaint, the police carried complaint boxes and helped women write their complaints and put them in the box. Women police personnel have been asked to set up WhatsApp groups with working women to redress their grievances, Ms. Sepat said.

Sara Fathima, DCP, Traffic, North division, launched a workshop to educate traffic policewomen about menstruation and pregnancy while on duty.

Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao, on the eve of International Women's Day, directed the police to identify girl students who had excelled in academics last year, felicitate them and put them in charge of the jurisdictional police station for an hour to honour them.

328,2020/03/09,Three Infosys employees arrested in I-T returns fraud case,"Three employees of Infosys Ltd., who have been accused of accessing personal information and hastening the income tax refund process, have been terminated on the charge of violating company policies. The three employees illegally contacted the income tax assessees and hastened the refund process for a gain.

On Sunday, the IT behemoth, which is the technology partner for the Income Tax Department’s Central Processing Centre (CPC) at Electronics City here, said that the employees had been terminated after a “thorough internal investigation”. It said the company took any breach of its policies and code of conduct seriously, and added, “We are fully cooperating with the authorities.”

The statement from Infosys comes after three of its employees — Renukakunta Kalyan Kumar, Deveeshwar Reddy, and Prakash — working at the CPC were arrested by the Electronics City police.

Sources in the department said the trio had contacted those assessees whose PAN had been flagged owing to major discrepancies, which meant the refund would take time till the case was cleared at the CPC. Sources said that since refunds would be delayed for such flagged PANs, the accused contacted the assessees directly and offered to process the returns for a commission of 4%.

According to the FIR registered based on a complaint from senior I-T official Sibichen Mathew, Renukakunta Kalyan Kumar took the help of the others in the crime. He would send a message to the assessee and promise to release the refund within seven days. One such case listed in the FIR pertained to the returns of about ₹15.89 lakh, which he illegally released and took 4% commission.

331,2020/03/09,Coronavirus | Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams to get thermal guns for screening devotees,"Areas of congregation being sanitised at regular intervals, says official

The widespread scare of COVID-19 seems to have no impact on the rush to Tirumala, the abode of Lord Sri Venkateswara. The average number of devotees remains at 75,000 per day touching close to 1 lakh during weekends.

The rush is expected to increase in the ensuing holidays. A majority of pilgrims visiting Tirumala belongs to Tamil Nadu. In view of COVID-19 threat, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has advised devotees against visiting the Venkateswara temple not to come for darsan if they have even slightest symptoms of cold, sore throat or fever.

Covid-19: full coverage

After a review meeting convened by TTD chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy and executive officer Anil Singhal, additional executive officer A.V. Dharma Reddy told The Hindu on Sunday that there was no need to panic as the administration had taken all precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Since several thousands of devotees come from across India, a decision had been taken to procure thermal guns to screen the devotees before they entered the main temple.

333,2020/03/09,Seven city college students arrested after clash on Nelson Manickam Road,"Police say one group acted in retaliation to the attack carried out last week

Motorists and pedestrians on Nelson Manickam Road were left terrified after a group of students from Pachaiyappa’s College attacked two students of Presidency College with sharp weapons on Friday.

The Choolaimedu police have arrested seven students in connection with the case.

According to police, Nehru is a third-year student of Presidency College.

On Friday evening, he was riding back to his house in Thirumangalam after college with his friend Balchander.

CCTV footage from the road showed the two stopping near the Nelson Manickam Road bus stop.

All of a sudden, a 10-member gang attacked them with sharp weapons.

Attacked with weapons

The two abandoned the bike and tried to escape. However, the gang caught Nehru, overpowered him, and attacked both of them with weapons.

The footage shows motorists and pedestrians terrified by the violence.

Some of them informed the police and the Choolaimedu police inspector T. Anand Babu rushed to the spot.

Nehru was rushed to the Kilpauk Medical College hospital.

Case registered

A case was registered under various sections of the IPC, including criminal intimidation, attempt to murder and rioting with sharp weapons.

On Saturday, the police arrested the main accused Karthik, 20, a student of Pachaiyappa’s college and six others, including a juvenile.

While the juvenile was sent to the government observation home, the others were remanded in judicial custody.

During investigation, the police found that the students of both the colleges travel on bus route 40A, between Avadi and Anna Square.

“Last week, Presidency College boys attacked those of Pachaiyappa’s College. This attack was in retaliation,” said a police officer.

Steps were being taken to curb such clashes, said the police officer.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/seven-city-college-students-arrested-after-clash-on-nelson-manickam-road/article31018462.ece
334,2020/03/09,Speeding motorcyclist falls to death from bridge,"His friend, who was riding pillion, escaped with injuries

A 23-year-old engineering graduate riding a two-wheeler died after he rammed the metal barricades placed on the rail over bridge on Basin Bridge Road and fell on the railway track on Saturday night. His friend, who was riding pillion, escaped with injuries and has been admitted to a hospital.

According to the police, Livingston Daniel, 23, a resident of Rajamangalam, was searching for a job. His friend Karthik, a resident of Old Washermenept, is working in a private company.

According to the Pulianthope traffic investigation wing, the two had gone out on Saturday evening. They were returning to Washermenpet via Basin Bridge Road.

Since work on constructing a parapet wall on the Rail Over Bridge has been going on for some time, two layers of barricades have been placed to prevent people from falling on the railway track.

CCTV footage showed the bike coming at a great speed. Instead of turning right on the bridge, the youth rammed the metal barricades.

“The two fell from a height of 30 feet and in the impact Livingston died on the spot and Karthik sustained injuries. He was rushed to the Government Stanley Hospital for treatment. It is suspected that the two were drunk,” said a police officer.

A crane was brought to the spot to lift the bike from the track.

“The youngster, under the influence of alcohol, seems to have lost control while taking the turn,” the officer said.

A case has been registered and further investigation is on.

Railway officials said that the compound wall was damaged a few years ago in an accident.

Busy stretch

“We cannot shut down the road as it is a very busy stretch. Hence, we took all precautions and placed barricades. The work is expected to be completed in a month,” said an official.

Police said that metal plates could have been placed instead of barricades on the ROB.

“The railway barricades are strong. In this case, the motorists were thrown off due to the high speed. The railways should, however, complete the work soon,” said a senior police officer.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/9yayeu/article31018451.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THBASINBRIDGERAILWAYWALLMOTORISTFELLINTOTRACKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/speeding-motorcyclist-falls-to-death-from-bridge/article31018452.ece
335,2020/03/09,Spate of requests to alter name of child’s father in birth records,"Corporation rejects applications citing lack of directions from High Court

The Greater Chennai Corporation has received several requests for change in the name of the child’s father in birth certificates. But the civic body has refused to accept the requests, citing lack of proper directions from the Madras High Court.

Several challenges faced by the women have led to a sudden a rise in the number of such requests to the Corporation, say civic officials. “We are receiving many applications for change in the name of the father in birth certificates. We have rejected all applications. The Corporation cannot change the father’s name in the birth records. The Madras High Court has also been rejecting the pleas of mothers who want to change the names of their children’s father,” said an official.

Women who have remarried after the death of their husband have been requesting the civic body to include the husband’s name in the birth certificate of their babies. Women who have remarried after separation have also demanded that the Corporation include their husband’s name in the birth certificate of the baby, in the place of the biological father.

The rush for such certificates has been intense in the past few months, officials said.

‘Try and help’

“Some people think that it is unethical to change the father’s name in the birth certificate of a child. But the Corporation should study all legal aspects of the issue. Instead of rejecting the applications, the Corporation should try to help such women. Civic officials should understand the challenges faced by the women and the peculiar problems associated with such applications,” said Egmore MLA K.S. Ravichandran.

Officials said other States have reported some developments on such issues. For instance, the Bombay High Court recently allowed the plea of a woman who wanted the name of her daughter’s biological father removed from her birth certificate. The court directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to issue a birth certificate, removing the name of the father and to leave the space for the name of the biological father blank. The bench, however, rejected the woman’s prayer that the father’s name be removed from all records of the local body.

According to the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, the father or the mother is permitted to give the names of both parents and their addresses at the time of birth of a child.

Over 700 hospitals in the city have been permitted by the Corporation to log in and help parents get birth certificates in a day. The parents give a declaration, based on which the Corporation issues a birth certificate for the baby. The Registrar of Births will verify if the birth is “real”, before issuing the certificate. The Corporation has no power to change the name of the father after the entry is made in the birth records, said an official.

The Directorate of Public Health has clarified that the Greater Chennai Corporation cannot change the name of the baby’s father without an order of the High Court, officials added.

Before giving directions, the court has to rely on the 2015 judgment of the Supreme Court that states that the Registrar of Births cannot compel single mothers to disclose the name of their baby’s biological father for issuance of birth certificates.

Ekta Foundation for Women founder-director Bimla Chandrasekar said: “We should encourage and strengthen women to speak out. We should also encourage them to move on.” She also pointed out there was a difference between biological father and social father and the biological father cannot be changed.

Child’s rights

Noted advocate and activist with the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), D. Nagasaila, contended that the birth certificate had nothing to do with the relationship between the father and the mother.

“The birth certificate is the primary proof needed to claim maintenance or for property for the child,” she pointed out.

Ms. Nagasaila added: “The mother might not want to have any connection with the man, but it is a matter of the right of the child to know his/her father. One cannot change the facts.”

Though A. Arulmozhi, propaganda secretary of the Dravidar Kazhagam, accepted that the facts of the birth certificate cannot be altered, she advocated that there should be a change in the social psyche, especially in India, in this regard.

“In India, most forms for applications ask for the father’s name. For instance, for a passport for a child living with the mother, it is necessary to either get a consent letter from the father or a court order. This should change,” she contended.

Even as the Tamil Nadu government has made provisions to include names of the father and the mother, all State governments in the country should implement the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, she said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/4z85t9/article31018289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/680f23a7-febd-4041-b66d-2d6b59e98a76,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/spate-of-requests-to-alter-name-of-childs-father-in-birth-records/article31018290.ece
336,2020/03/09,Woman injured as hospital lift plunges to ground floor,"Six escape unhurt; eight-month-old was among those inside

A woman sustained injuries when a lift in a private hospital on Big Street, Triplicane, plunged from the third floor on Sunday. Six others, including a child, escaped largely unhurt.

While the woman is being treated in the hospital, the eight-month-old was taken to another hospital nearby to check for internal injuries.

A. Sadullah, who was in the lift, said the family with the child having running high fever came to Sakthi Hospital and Research Centre, where the accident took place. “After initial check-up, we were asked to take the child to the third floor to admit it to the ward. A hospital nurse, who accompanied us, asked us to take the lift, while she herself took the stairs,” he said.

According to him, when the lift was about to reach the third floor, it suddenly plunged to the ground floor. “Parts of the ceiling fell on us,” he added. A. Saida, 42, who was holding the child, injured her shoulder as she tried to protect the baby.

“One of us had a swelling on the head,” he added. K. Amanullah, a resident of Ice House, where the family is from, said a complaint had been filed with the police, against the hospital, for alleged negligence. “The hospital did not have a lift operator. We are not sure if it was under proper maintenance. Ms. Saida works as a domestic help, and must be compensated for her loss of income,” he said.

Hospital authorities refused to comment on the incident.

337,2020/03/09,State-run oil companies issue letters of intent for new outlets in Tamil Nadu,"35% outlets to come up in rural areas

State-run oil companies are in the process of issuing letters of intent (LoI) to prospective dealers for setting up new outlets in Tamil Nadu. Each company has issued letters for about 300 outlets, of which at least a third are in the rural category.

The State has around 4,800 fuel outlets and the companies in 2016 advertised for 5,125 locations with an investment of around ₹1,300 crore. Neighbouring Puducherry was to get around 140 new outlets.

“The selection process was kept on hold due to a court stay. However, after it was vacated, LoI are now being issued. Indian Oil issued 248 letters of intent till mid-February. It planned to set up 2,615 new retail outlets, for which applications were called and we received response for 2,277 locations,” said P. Jayadevan, executive director, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL).

Sources in the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (HPCL) said that 35% outlets were to come up in rural areas, 20-25% along highways and the remaining in urban areas.

“We are not just looking at high-volume centres like Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Madurai and Coimbatore, but also at remote places. Both ‘A’ sites, where investment will be more by the companies, and ‘B’ sites, where the dealer will have to invest more, are to come up,” an official said.

Process still on

Sources in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. said the process of issuing LoI was still on. “Though we have chosen sites, some applications are getting rejected,” the official said.

But dealers have been objecting to oil companies planning to set up such a large number of outlets. “Only a small portion of bunks are high-volume outlets. There are many in the rural areas and even outside the urban limits that barely scrape by due to high-running costs. Then there is also competition from private brands,” said a dealer.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/state-run-oil-companies-issue-letters-of-intent-for-new-outlets-in-tamil-nadu/article31017894.ece

The SASTRA team came first in the moot court competition.

Madras High Court judge C. V. Karthikeyan said that the structure and pedagogy of teaching in colleges should change. When students go into practice, they should have the foundation for it, he said. If a student is planning to practice on the civil side, they should know how a tahsildar office functions. Similarly, if they are planning to go to the criminal side, they must be taught how a post mortem is done, he added.

University vice-chancellor T.S.N. Sastry said that moot courts helped students become competent to argue in courts. Taxation, he said was a highly neglected subject in legal education in the country and that not many law schools had dedicated departments for the same.

Advocate and grandson of Ramamani, Vikram Vijayaraghavan said that moot courts were meant to teach students about laws. “These are problems that we face as lawyers and moots prepare students for actual litigation work,” he said.

340,2020/03/09,Chennai’s activist offers food for thought on PM’s Twitter handle,"Sneha Mohandoss urges people to donate excess food to needy

“You heard of food for thought. Now, it is time for action and a better future for our poor,” read the first lines of Sneha Mohandoss’s tweet from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Twitter handle on Sunday morning.

The 27-year-old resident of Chennai, who founded Foodbank India, was among women from across the country who took over the Prime Minister’s social media profiles as part of the #SheInspiresUs campaign to mark the International Women’s Day.

Founded in 2015, Foodbank India is an NGO which works towards eradicating hunger among the homeless. They organise mass cooking and food donation drives and urge people to donate excess food at events, such as weddings, to ensure that there is no wastage.

“I’ve always believed that social media has been an extremely powerful tool to reach out to the public and was honoured to be given the opportunity to speak to people across the country through the Prime Minister’s profile. My main intent is to spread awareness about hunger and food wastage,” she said.

Hunger mapping

In a tweet from the Prime Minister’s profile, she said, “I urge everyone to feed at least one needy person and contribute to a hunger-free planet.”

Speaking about Foodbank India’s work in Chennai, Ms. Sneha said that they had a team of over 100 volunteers. “We have familiarised ourselves with the city through ‘hunger mapping’. Our volunteers pick up food from anyone who wishes to donate and then distribute it to the homeless,” she said.

Among their recent initiatives was urging the public to donate a protein pack, comprising chickpeas, which would be handed over to a home for children affected with HIV.

In the last few years, she said the awareness about food wastage had risen greatly. “During wedding season, we get up to 50 calls a day from wedding halls, where families ask us to pick up excess food and distribute it,” she added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/kcw4fk/article31017694.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FBIMG1583682392645,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennais-activist-offers-food-for-thought-on-pms-twitter-handle/article31017696.ece

342,2020/03/09,No green shoots of a revival in sight as yet,"The latest GDP data show that there has been an undeniable decline in the growth rate over seven consecutive quarters

On February 28, as per its release calendar, the National Statistical Office (NSO) put out the third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) estimates, that is, for October-December 2019. It showed that domestic output grew at 4.7% at constant prices (that is, net of inflation), compared to the same period the previous year. As the third quarter GDP was marginally higher than the second quarter (July-September 2019) figure of 4.5% (as reported in the earlier data released), experts in the media were quick to infer that the economy is turning around. This was also in line with expectations of many forecasters. Hence, many concluded that the economic slowdown witnessed during the last six quarters has “bottomed out”; government spokespersons endorsed the view.

However, a closer reading reveals that the latest data release has revised the estimates of the first two quarters of the current year (2019-2020) upwards to 5.6% and 5.1%, from the earlier figures of 5% and 4.5%, respectively. The upward revisions have, perhaps unwittingly, changed the interpretation of the current year’s Q3 estimate: the slowdown has continued, not bottomed out; hence, there is no economic revival in sight as of now.

Thus, we have competing views of what the third quarter performance really means for the economy, giving rise to the suspicion of the integrity of the latest revision.

The question therefore is why did the current year’s Q1 and Q2 GDP estimates get revised upwards? The answer is this was simply because the corresponding figures for the previous year (2018-2019) got revised downwards. Many viewed the revision of last year’s estimates as evidence of lack of credibility of the NSO’s revision process. Such doubts are well taken, given the long-standing debate and unresolved disputes on the veracity of GDP figures put out since 2015, when the statistical office released the new series of National Accounts with 2011-2012 as base year.

Constant revisions

We will explain why the annual GDP estimates undergo revisions, and how quarterly output estimation is related to the annual figures.

GDP is a statistical construct — unlike the temperature on a thermometer — prepared using many bits of quantitative information on an economy’s production, consumption and incomes. Many statistical models and methods are used following standardised analytical procedures in line with the international guideline called the UN System of National Accounts (UNSNA). The GDP revision followed the latest (2008) edition of UNSNA. As there are lags and unanticipated delays in obtaining the primary data, the GDP estimates undergo several revisions everywhere (except in China).

GDP estimates are revised five times in India over nearly three years. The initial two rounds, the advanced estimates, are prepared mainly using high-frequency proxy indicators (which probably contain more noise than information), followed by three rounds based on data obtained from various sectors.

More based on projections

Since 1999, quarterly GDP estimates are being prepared, as per the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s data dissemination standards. Their quality is subpar as the primary data needed quarterly are mostly lacking. For example, nearly one-half of India’s GDP originates in the unorganised sector (including agriculture), whose output is not easily amenable to direct estimation every quarter, given the informal nature of production and employment. Hence, the estimates are obtained as ratios, proportions and projections of the annual GDP estimates.

The National Accounts Statistics (NAS)-Sources and Methods 2012, the official guide for national accounts estimation, states it as follows: “The production approach is used for compiling the QGDP estimates, in terms of gross value added (GVA) and is broadly based on the benchmark-indicator method. In this method, for each of the industry-groups... a key indicator or a set of key indicators for which data in volume or quantity terms is available on a quarterly basis are used to extrapolate the value of output/value-added estimates of the previous year… In general terms, quarterly estimates of GDP are extrapolations of annual series of GDP. The estimates of GVA by industry are compiled by extrapolating value of output or value-added with relevant indicators.”

The NSO continues to follow these practices.

So what can we make of the disagreements over the quarterly GDP growth estimates for 2019-2020? The revisions were probably in line with the latest changes in the annual estimates (second advance estimates). The press release stated: “Quarterly estimates of the previous years along with the first and second quarterly estimates of 2019-20 released earlier have undergone revision in accordance with the revision policy of National Accounts.” True, there were considerable variations at the sectoral estimates after the revision, which probably contained more noise than information. For now, there is little ground to question the revised estimates based on the publicly available information.

Undeniable decline

However, if we accept the latest data, it is clear, though in an alarming way, that there has been an undeniable decline in the GDP growth rate over seven consecutive quarters, from 7.1% in Q1 of 2018-2019 to 4.7% in Q3 of 2019-2020. Considering that physical indicators of production, such as the official index of infrastructure output, or monthly automotive sales, continue to show an unambiguous deceleration, the economic slowdown has apparently not bottomed-out as the government would like to believe.

More seriously, the quarterly GDP deceleration comes over and above the annual GDP growth slowdown for four years now: from 8.3% in 2016-17 to 5% in 2019-20 (as per the second advance estimate). Further, it bears repetition that many have questioned the entire GDP revision since 2015 to the new base-year for possible over-estimation of output growth. If the validation exercises of former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian and others have merit, the actual GDP growth rate during much of the 2010s may have been lower than the official annual estimates by 2-2.5 percentage points.

To conclude, India’s quarterly GDP estimates have limited primary information in them. Their revisions are largely extrapolations and projections of the annual figures. Hence, one should be cautious in reading too much into the specific numbers. They are helpful to discern the broad trends in economic activity, which appear grave at the moment. Economic growth continues to drift downwards, from a peak of 7.1% in the first quarter of 2018-19 to 4.7% in the third quarter of the current year. It probably suggests more pain ahead, as the green shoots of economic revival seem nowhere in sight.

343,2020/03/09,Saying ‘Yes’ to bailout,"Though an interesting outcome of the Yes Bank fiasco is the acknowledgement of the role of public sector banks, with the State Bank of India (SBI) having been asked to play the role of saviour, it has thrown open some other points for discussion too. One, why should the government take the responsibility of saving a purely privately owned bank which was run as a private fiefdom of the promoter-owner? Does this not amount to putting the interests of minority shareholders of the SBI at risk? Sadly, when it comes to the question of compensation to be paid to the employees or pensioners of the SBI, the same Finance Ministry takes a different stand and begins talking about its ‘paying capacity’.

B.C. Unnikrishnan Nair,

Kuthiathode, Kerala

The move to suspend normal business operations of Yes Bank has put thousands of customers to untold suffering; even though the brisk bailout plan offers some respite. Given the exposure of Yes bank to corporate loans, it is unclear how the money is going to be recovered, if at all. Bad loans may reflect the underlying woes in the borrower industries, ranging from real estate to power (Editorial, “Banking on bailouts: On Yes Bank crisis,” March 8). At the same time, one cannot also rule out the possibility of bad loans echoing the greedy intentions of a few unscrupulous businessmen, who want to follow the footprints of Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi. It would do no harm if the investigative agencies round up the potential economic fugitives, perhaps already in the radar for other economic offences and frauds, indebted to Yes Bank, who want to cross the shores without paying their dues.

A.Venkatasubramanian

Tiruchi, Tamil Nadu.

Yes Bank started its operation in January 2004. From its inception, it adopted an aggressive strategy to attract customers. It offered an interest rate of 2 percentage points above the usual rates offered by other banks on Savings Bank accounts. Also, Yes Bank funded its credit disbursements through both deposits and bond issues, while other banks relied primarily on deposits. Its business figures rose at a higher rate than those of other banks. These incidents should have made the RBI monitor its transactions more closely. But that didn’t happen. In order to avoid such mishaps in future, a thorough investigation should be done of all the Annual Financial Inspection Reports compiled by the Reserve Bank of India from 2015 on Yes Bank.

V.P. Bhaskaran,

Kozhikode

The fallout of the Yes Bank crisis marks the first such instance involving a new-age private sector lender. The RBI, which has been facing lot of flak on supervision lapses in the cases of Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC), should have prevented the beleaguered Yes Bank from being disintegrated. The unfolding events at Yes Bank that led to its down-slope point to serious lapses in the way risk management systems are designed in the Indian banking system and RBI’s scantiness as a supervision authority. Promoter-driven banks need special regulatory focus and corporate governance loopholes need to be plugged. The story of Yes Bank throws up an important cautionary lesson to other private banks that mere focus on technology and stalking high growth in relying on corporate banking and wholesale deposits to boost balance sheet will not work. Sagacious lending and high corporate governance are crucial for any bank’s survival.

A detailed study of banks failing to perform efficiently may reveal that what is to blame is the attitude of some of the big borrowing entities, who avail all sorts of concessions and exemptions, avail the lion’s share of banks’ loan, and later feel that it is their privilege not to bother about repayment. The government should think in terms of arresting them and confiscating all their and their benami assets instead of bailout or bail in schemes.

346,2020/03/09,Faith in judiciary,"Justice Madan Lokur, in his article “Making the environment conducive for justice” (March 7), has pleaded for a proactive intervention by the judiciary to prevent the country’s slide into chaos. First, there needs to be a constitutional audit of the Supreme Court’s recent decisions. Through its Ayodhya verdict, the apex court emboldened the Hindutva forces. It is not clear as to how under a secular Constitution, a court could issue direction for building a temple. The decision created fear in the minds of minorities. Coming to the dilution of Article 370 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, an issue that is now before the Supreme Court, the Central government placed Opposition leaders under house arrest. Coming to Delhi violence, registration of FIRs against persons making hate speeches was deferred, adding to the unrest. On the other hand, citizens critical of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) were treated as traitors and cases were registered promptly against them. When a request was made for an urgent hearing on the CAA, the Supreme Court said it would be heard only after the Sabarimala review petitions. The role of judiciary, when it comes to values like secularism and pluralism, becomes very important. Proactive action by courts, which claim to be protectors of the Constitution, can restore the faith of the common people, including the minorities in the justice system.

K.K. Ram Siddhartha,

What former Supreme Court judges A.K. Patnaik and Kurian Joseph said after visiting the recent riot-hit areas in Delhi amounted to a damning indictment and abject failure of duty of the powers-that-be (“State has failed to do its job,” Mar. 7). The movable and immovable assets/items destroyed or lost could be replaced. But what about the precious lives that have been lost forever? The state has a bounden duty to bring rioters and their abettors to justice and mete out deterrent punishment to them. The survivors of the riot must be allowed to live in peace and with self-esteem.

The article “Making the environment conducive for justice” (Editorial page, March 7) should serve an eye-opener to all those who believe in justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. The onus is squarely on the state to ensure that justice is not only done but also seen to be done. The soul of India will remain uneasy if the guilty are allowed to get away. Those in authority have a duty to ensure that only the rule of law is supreme, but also justice is absolutely impartial to all. Every citizen of the country has an inalienable right to live here and, among other things, practise the religion of his choice. It is never a favour but his most precious inherited birthright as a citizen of India.

‘Unity in diversity’ is not only India’s/our most signal binding factor but also the apple of its/our eye. We will be left disintegrated and groping about in the dark if it is tampered with. It is the duty of the state to protect and preserve this irreplaceable asset for the very existence and survival of India.

347,2020/03/09,Cory George of F45 Training: I regret my former bodybuilding-like mentality,"The 27-year-old was recently in Hyderabad for a massive training event at Begumpet Hockey Stadium

The heat at Begumpet Hockey Stadium is not just from the searing sun at 8 am on Saturday, but also from widespread excitement as more than 500 people lunge, squat and jump in unison. The ground trembles with the bass from peppy remixes. Above the music and excited voices is the twang of Cory George, the face of F45, who towers over the crowd.

MetroPlus caught up with Cory before the training event, where he shows off some demos with his team.

“I did not know what to expect of the market prior to coming here,” he explains, “but in India, I’ve noticed there’s been an influence on more of a traditional bodybuilding mentality, so I’ve done some research on the gyms here, on the one-on-one model here. Group training is something with big influences but was missed here. Due to the fact that gyms always hold intimidating factors — be it equipment, another person, or even stepping foot inside a gym — group training sees multiple trainers and gym-goers from different walks of life.”

The 27-year-old admits his journey into functional fitness was not a traditional one, stating that he regretfully leaned into a bodybuilding lifestyle. “I have a lot of ongoing injuries from moving incorrectly (not properly warming up or grabbing too much weight) and I was not being educated on specific movements and was just pushing myself through something I should not have. So functional fitness becoming more popular, is self-explanatory. It answers questions such as ‘why do we need to squat, deadlift, hip hinge?’ Most harmful occurrences happen from incorrect movements you should naturally be able to do.”

For the love of a cheat meal

Cory then recalls the first time he took a class and how he was smitten with the process, “I worked with somebody that was a little overweight that had literally never picked up a weight in their life and I was also training with an NBA player; we were in the same class, doing the same circuits but going at our own athletic levels and still being challenges at these paces, which I had never seen before.”

Cory is not uncomfortable talking about cheat meals and other similar indulgences. In fact, his face lights up when it is mentioned. “Most people stress about a cheat meal, because they’re constantly cheating,” he confides with a chuckle, “which explains why someone gets overly concerned, and this comes back to consistency. Between 80 and 90 percent of my diet is clean so if I were to eat a piece of cake or a glass of chocolate milk which I love, I’m not stressing about it. I’ll save those for like date night or a social gathering.”",fitness,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/8mm6qf/article31021192.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy09-cory-training,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/cory-george-f45-training-hyderabad-workout-event-begumpet/article31021193.ece
348,2020/03/09,Public interest journalism needs public investment,"Fair pricing of news products alone can sustain independent media

Last Thursday, I stood in a queue at the Indira Gandhi International Airport to take the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) test. When three wide-bodied aircraft landed in quick succession, the queue got longer, and the process slower. In order to ease the passing of time, to borrow a phrase from the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges, I began reading a report, “Evacuation from China, Quarantine in the UK: A Covid-19 Dispatch” by Lavender Au published in The New York Review of Books. It was a printout that I had taken in Kathmandu before coming to India.

The idea of a paywall

The many references to COVID-19 and quarantine in the text, printed in large font, attracted the attention of a couple of fellow travellers. The moment they realised that I am the Readers’ Editor of The Hindu, their focus shifted from the virus to journalism. They insisted that The Hindu should at least place its stories on COVID-19, including ones debunking myths surrounding the virus, outside the paywall. They told me that it is the duty of a major publication like The Hindu to not only generate credible reports, but also make them available to every reader.

The next day, this newspaper carried a lead article by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh titled “An unrest, a slowdown and a health epidemic”. My fellow travellers called me and said that important articles like Dr. Singh’s should also be offered free. They used two terms while arguing their point: ‘credible news’ and ‘democratic duty’. As a news ombudsman, I am also beholden to these two terms. The very idea of having an interlocutor between the readers and the editorial shows the newspaper’s commitment to foster trust and build a better news ecology that can confront the spread of disinformation and misinformation.

I support the idea of a paywall for a simple reason: public interest journalism needs public investment. Fair pricing of news products, be it in print or on digital platforms, alone can sustain independent media. The idea that news is free actually undermines the sustainability of the news industry. In light of these fresh demands for placing specific stories outside the paywall, I had a long interaction on this issue with the Editor, Suresh Nambath. His arguments were also for fair pricing.

Rationale for the subscription model

Mr. Nambath explained the rationale for the subscription model as devised by The Hindu’s digital team: “It’s been long recognised now that advertising, which sustains the printed newspaper to a large extent, is a really weak source of revenue when it comes to digital publications. That doesn’t mean advertising has no role to play; it does play a role, albeit a limited one. A large number of digital start-ups in news have come up in recent years without a business model to speak of — many of these are kept afloat by money pumped in by venture capitalists. The Hindu decided to tap digital subscriptions, and last year became the first mainstream Indian publication to do so.”

Mr. Nambath explained how this source of revenue is seen as a natural fit for the kind of journalism the newspaper practises. “Many others who have tried to tap digital advertising to its fullest have done so by throwing in a lot of, what we could call, low quality viral content. These publications have been okay with publishing gossip, unconfirmed news, stories about personal lives of celebrities, stories with graphic description of violence and so on in their attempts to get as many page views as possible. In fact, the philosophy that governs our print publication is also the philosophy that governs our online properties. Only the formats change. The journalism and values behind the journalism are the same. Given this, the best way to make it a sustainable proposition was to tap subscriptions. This helps us have a direct relationship with the reader,” he said.

News gathering and news processing are expensive. The Hindu’s seamless coverage of news is a result of the round-the-clock efforts of hundreds of people — reporters, editors, fact-checkers, photographers, videographers, publishers and support staff.

The price of digital subscription turns out to be less than ₹2.50 a day. Subscriptions come with a host of additional benefits. This is an essential democratic investment.

350,2020/03/09,Chennai’s attempt at Chinese yum cha culture,"It is about more than just dim sums. It is a tradition from further East that Chennai is finally warming up to

They call it the vegan treasure. It looks like a pink flower. Which is fitting, since the idea behind Chap Chay’s yum cha festival is to celebrate spring.

Many among their 51 dumpling varieties on offer seem to follow this theme: the quail and cashed har gow, for instance, is a transparent starch roll with a delicate, purple filling showing through. It is paired with a deep golden-brown chrysanthemum tea after considerable deliberation, for it is the combination of both that sits in the heart of yum cha.

Or so Chef Suraj Rana says. The chef, along with Executive Chef Tamoghna Chakraborty, have much to say about the intricacies of yum cha culture. It is always light food, they insist, like a late breakfast, or an early lunch, or a little something in the evening. It is also, always, a combination of dim sums and tea, but that doesn’t mean that there is any shortage of variety.

Also served here Sian, Vivanta Chennai, OMR

HuTong, Alwarpet

China XO, The Leela Palace, MRC Nagar

Nasi and Mee Asian Canteen, Nungambakkam

Stix, Hyatt Regency, Teynampet

The menu at their festival gives a glimpse into just how vast the world of dim sum is — broad varieties include the pan-fried guotie, pan-grilled jian jiao, steamed open siu mai, Cantonese style, see-through har gows, steamed and rice noodle-based cheung fun, broth-laden xiao long bao, dessert-esque tiandian, and, of course, the baozi characterised by its steamed milk buns.

Each of these offer plenty of scope to play around with, when it comes to stuffings, sauces and flavour combinations. A sweet honey pork preparation, for instance, is stuffed inside an even sweeter, spongy bao — this dish doesn’t even try to balance flavours evenly. Instead, it goes all-out to pleasure the sweet tooth, and it works.

Textures are also experimented with, like delicate cheung fun that can barely hold its own weight, but is wrapped around surprisingly sturdy and loudly crunchy shoots of tempura asparagus.

Chennai is no stranger to dumplings. But its appetite has been mildly whetted so far, with only a few quality yum cha options on offer. These are not to be confused with mere dimsum menus — they offer almost an education in taste and variety, and also open up palates to a range of teas to go with.

Tea is key Chap Chay has a few interesting pairings

A taut herbal grass tea made with green tea, turmeric and butterfly pea flower, paired with a range of sweet baozis

A strong cranberry apple tea, slightly on the sweeter side, that does well with a pan-grilled fatty chicken jian jiao

Yum cha is essentially supposed to have both, and then that something extra in terms of vibe to tie it all together. The term is essentially a verb — some say “yum cha” means drinking tea, while others say it means delicately scarfing dimsum. All seem to agree, however, that it also stands as a noun synonymous with the meal itself, and that the closest Western frame of reference for the uninitiated is brunch: less formal, but as simple or as elaborate as you choose to make it. Albeit not ruled by the clock.

351,2020/03/09,Did someone say buffet? Head to Cur8 for a multitude of options,"From sourdough pizza to quinoa salad, there is something for everyone

A buffet is always a safe bet for group outings though holidays at resorts or cruises with buffet tables groaning with similar looking and tasting food is beyond depressing. So it was with mixed feelings I headed to CUR8 at Four Seasons Hotel in Hebbal, where there are buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as an expansive Sunday brunch buffet.

We visited CUR8 for dinner after watching a lovely musical. Would the high after the musical be tamped down or soar higher after the meal at CUR8? The name is supposed to echo a curated meal and 8 is for the address of the hotel — 8 Bellary Road, yes another address-themed name.

One of the fun things about CUR8 are the different islands for live stations. It makes a nice change from rows of platters with glass lids kept on warmers with gravy-slick ladles on the side. After ogling at the custom-designed charcoal grill pit, the ginormous pizza oven and the bakery counter, we get down to the serious business of negotiating this land of milk and honey.

Menus that run into many pages are intimidating. Ditto for buffets with a zillion choices. We are, however, helped by the smiling wait staff. We start as always with salad. Since I am in a quinoa frame of mind, I go for the quinoa salad and old favourite tomato and feta. There is also sea bass and prawn on the salad counter, which my companion enjoys.

Starters include tandoori pomfret, chicken, paneer and vegetable tikki — all of which deliver on their promise. The pizza deserves a special mention. The oven with wooden logs stacked around it, reminded me of a mystery novel (must have been an Agatha Christie) where the will or some crucial piece of evidence is hidden in the wood pile — one of the logs is hollow.

Instead of the all-important clue, I chose a Margherita and was quite happy with my decision — who wants to solve a whodunnit when one can indulge in a wonderful pizza. Tomato, buffalo mozzarella and basil leaves on a crisp, thin crust was as much fun as a demonstration of Sherlock Holmes’ display of preternatural intelligence in solving the riddle of the dancing men or orange pips. Incidentally there is also a sourdough option for the pizza.

Hits: Pizza, steak, dal CUR8

Meal for one: ₹1,250 (breakfast), ₹1,350 (lunch) ₹1,650 (dinner)

For the main course, my companion had already decided he wanted to have a steak and so steak it was from the grill section. Well done, the charcoal grill added that irresistible smoky flavour to the crisp and juicy steak, which stood up to the Cypher test. Remember the traitor in The Matrix who chooses the simulation of a juicy steak to Morpheus’ portentous mumbling?

We tried the tiniest portions of Indian dishes, including the usual suspects of paneer labadar, subz meloni, soya mattar and many rotis and naans. Dal CUR8 was brilliant as was the raita with burnt cumin seeds. Desserts were competent and included chocolate mousse, Paris donut, berry tart and my super favourite lemon tart.

Pleasantly full we staggered out, with the high from the musical soaring on the gentle swell of good taste.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/rid9tc/article31022988.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06bgm-CUR84jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/did-someone-say-buffet-head-to-cur8-for-a-multitude-of-options/article31022991.ece

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday urged External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to see that Indians stranded in Iran in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak there get medical help and general assistance.

Iran is among the countries grappling with the outbreak, which has claimed 194 lives in that country.

“In the wake of the alarming Covid-19 issue, I voiced my concerns to Dr. S. Jaishankar ji, Union Minister of External Affairs regarding more than 40 Indian citizens stranded at Qom city in Iran. They are distressed and in urgent need of medical help and general assistance (sic),” Mr. Pawar tweeted.

Iran’s health ministry on Sunday reported 49 fresh deaths from COVID-19, the highest toll within 24 hours since the outbreak in the Islamic republic. This brings the number of those killed by the virus in the country since mid-February to 194.

The virus has spread to all of Iran’s 31 provinces with 6,566 confirmed cases. Iran has closed schools and universities until early April, and suspended major cultural and sporting events and reduced working hours to slow the contagion.

354,2020/03/09,Bhendi Bazaar takes leap into the future,"610 families move into two buildings completed under cluster redevelopment

After many failed attempts over the past decade, Bhendi Bazaar, one of the busiest business-cum-residential districts of the city, is taking a big leap into the future in what’s said to be the nation’s largest cluster redevelopment project.

The 125-year-old neighbourhood spanning 16.5-acres, not very far from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, is already home to two newly developed towers of 36 and 41 floors, which are opening a new world of modern living for the families there. Around 610 of the over 3,200 families and 128 of the over 1,250 businesses have moved in to the new buildings, all for free.

The families, who were living in 80-sq.ft. dilapidated homes, are moving into 350-sq.ft. modern apartments.

The ambitious cluster redevelopment programme is funded by the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust, established by the late Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, the former spiritual head of the Bohri Muslim community, who are the vast majority of the residents and tenants of the area.

The two towers have come up on the plot where 13 dilapidated buildings stood, and form part of the 13 towers to be developed at the site.

“The new neighbourhood will meet the present and future socio-economic needs of diverse communities living and working in the area,” Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust secretary Abdeali Bhanpurawala said.

The redevelopment comprises 16.5 acres of land with more than 250 decrepit buildings, 3,200 families and 1,250 shops, all of which will be incorporated into a state-of-the-art sustainable development model with wider roads, modern infrastructure, ample open spaces and highly visible commercial areas.

The State planned to redevelop the area almost a decade ago, but work was marred by slow pace.

The project involves razing 250 mostly dilapidated medium-rise structures and building 13 high-rise towers in their place. These towers will house existing commercial and residential tenants, who will be given ownership of their new apartments.

The project aims to add greenery, public spaces and glitzy shopping options to the 125-year-old market district, a holdover from the colonial days.

Originally built to accommodate migrant labourers working in the harbour, more recently Bhendi Bazaar has attracted low-income families, drawn by State-controlled rents that have been frozen for decades.

In 2009, the late Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin made the drastic proposal to demolish the 16.5-acre district, with the exception of its holy sites, and build anew.

It seemed an ambitious undertaking, but got the backing of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who made it a flagship smart city project in July 2015.

The two completed towers have been designed to include a recreational area with gardens and a playground and amenities like prayer room, multi-purpose hall, activity rooms, and separate gymnasium rooms for women and men. The commercial spaces are housed on the ground, first and second floors.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6qw9z9/article31020491.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BMBHENDIBAZAAR2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bhendi-bazaar-takes-leap-into-the-future/article31020492.ece

356,2020/03/09,6 documentaries make a pitch for support,"Films tackle issues like climate change, gender affirmative surgery, child marriage

Six documentaries tackling issues of climate change, gender affirmative surgery, Huntington’s disease, right to die with dignity, child marriage and the hip hop movement in Dharavi, sought support from allies and partners at Good Pitch India 2020 in Mumbai.

Under various stages of production, the six documentaries were offered support ranging from funding and promotion to distribution. In NCPA’s Experimental Theatre, under blue lights, filmmakers and producers pitched their projects to a roomful of social entrepreneurs, activists, distributors, producers, angel investors, philanthropists, impact strategists and educators.

In Megha Bhaduri’s Piano Fingers, the young director examines her father’s death due to Huntington’s disease and the impact the neurogenerative disorder has on her family. “We want doctors and medical schools to screen the film and use it as a tool for ethical debate,” said the film’s impact producer Naomi Shah. After their pitch, the makers were offered legal assistance and help from support groups and NGOs at the event.

Sankhajit Biswas’ Metamorphosis chronicles the transition of transgender woman Sudeb, and highlights the vulnerability transpersons face before and after gender affirmative surgery. Among the several who pledged support for the documentary was Father Thomas Ninan, member of the National Council of Churches in India, who engages churches, theological colleges and other faith communities across India in the area of sexuality and gender.

Documenting the hip hop movement in slums, Smriti Mundhra and Jerry Henry’s documentary, Dharavi, follows two brothers who are persevering odds to sustain their love for the dance form. “We want to spread the message that creativity should not be only for the wealthy,” said Mr. Henry.

Priya Thuvassery’s Coral Woman spotlights a homemaker from Tamil Nadu, who, through her paintings, has been trying to draw attention to the devastating effects of climate change on marine life and the coastal communities.

358,2020/03/09,‘Bunch of boys’ all set for India’s debut at Over-50 Cricket World Cup,"Professionals from all walks of life to play in South Africa from March 11 to 24; while funding trip on their own, team hopes for support from BCCI in future

At a time when professionals plan for life after retirement, a bunch of cricket-crazy Indians have been training hard for the past few weeks to take their passion to the next level. The players are set to represent India in the second edition of the Over-50 Cricket World Cup, to be played in South Africa from March 11 to 24.

Famous names

While some famous names from yesteryear like Carl Hooper (former West Indies captain) and Eddo Brandes (former Zimbabwe World Cup player) are set to represent their teams in the 12-team event, India is set to make a debut in the cricket tournament with players above the age of 50. Team India is placed in Pool B with countries like Pakistan, England and South Africa.

“At this age, we need more players who can chip in with all three departments of the game, so we have tried to include as many all-rounders as possible,” Shailendra Singh, the captain of the 16-member squad, told The Hindu before departing for the tournament.

Mr. Singh, a corporate executive and a regular at the historic Bombay Gymkhana in his whites over the weekend, hopes to draw inspiration from India’s maiden World Cup triumph in 1983. “The tactic (of having more all-rounders) is similar to that of Kapil Dev’s plan in 1983, which had six to seven all-rounders,” said Mr. Singh.

Mr. Singh is the founder of Percept Ltd., one of India’s first professional talent management company. The squad includes former assistant commissioner of police Iqbal Khan and Mayank Khandwala, who has served as the Mumbai Cricket Association treasurer.

Mr. Singh said his “bunch of boys” are funding the trip on their own with a plan to compete with the best in the tournament. He hoped that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the game’s governing body in the country, will offer support for veterans’ cricket in future. The support is critical for veterans’ cricket to gain momentum, he said.

“The idea is to play well and create an impact on people to draw them towards this form of cricket. A lot of veteran cricketers have given up playing after retirement and are busy with commentary. Such tournaments offer an opportunity for them to be engaged on the field again and emphasise the fact that age is just a number,” Mr. Singh said.

No stopping

“A sportsman should not stop at the age of 50. This format is like women’s cricket and will take time to pick up. It will expand the game to Indians so that more people our age will be inspired to play sport.”

If Mr. Singh’s men can be half as effective against England in its tournament opener on March 11 as Kapil’s batch of 1983, the veterans’ game could find its feet in a cricket-crazy nation.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cqp0yv/article31018744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BM-over-50s-cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bunch-of-boys-all-set-for-indias-debut-at-over-50-cricket-world-cup/article31018746.ece
359,2020/03/09,"May day in mind, BMC steps up drive against plastic","More than 2,000 kg of banned plastic confiscated from establishments in first week of March, ₹25 lakh collected in fines from offenders

As the government pushes to make Maharashtra single-use plastic-free by May 1, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has intensified its efforts against banned plastic. Between March 1 and 7, it confiscated more than 2,000 kg of banned plastic and collected fines of around ₹25 lakh.

The State government had in March 2018 issued a notification banning the manufacture, sale and use of all single-use plastic bags. It also banned an array of plastic products, including cutlery, straws and containers. The ban allows for a penalty between ₹5,000 and ₹25,000.

The government had allowed people time till June 23 that year to dispose of these items, following which municipal corporations started drives to confiscate banned plastic and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board took measures to close down manufacturing units.

However, after about a year, the drive lost momentum and single-use plastic became freely available in the market. The ban was the brainchild of Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray, implemented by then environment minister Ramdas Kadam.

Renewed efforts

On becoming Environment Minister, Mr. Thackeray reviewed the ban in January and declared that the State will be free of single-use plastic from May 1. Following this, the BMC has been cracking down on establishments from March 1. Between June 2018 and February 1, 2020, civic bodies across the State have confiscated 84,210 kg of plastic and recovered ₹4 crore in penalties.

From March 1, the BMC has made 23,018 visits to various establishments and confiscated 2,097 kg of banned plastic. It has levied fines worth ₹25.3 lakh.

An officer from the BMC’s licence department said, “Our blue squads are carrying out regular inspections in markets that see the highest influx of plastic. We have found some repeat offenders as well, who have been penalised ₹10,000 for the second offence. The effect is to be seen as many vendors are not keeping or distributing plastic bags in many markets. But we also want consumers to stop demanding bags and plan their day in such a way that they carry a cloth bag from home. A folded cloth bag can be kept in purses, cars or two-wheelers at all times for unplanned purchases.”

Alaksha Kale, a resident of Sion, said, “I don’t see any effect yet. Vegetable and fruit vendors are still giving plastic bags. Even the thinnest ones are in circulation. Authorities should find out the source.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/14wwn9/article31018728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9BMPlastic-Bannedcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/may-day-in-mind-bmc-steps-up-drive-against-plastic/article31018729.ece
360,2020/03/09,"Ahead of civic polls, MNS to hold anniversary meet in Navi Mumbai","Party hopes to cash in on disgruntled Sena-BJP supporters with its Hindutva avatar

Struggling to stay relevant in the era of political upheavals, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) will, for the first time since its inception 14 years ago, hold its anniversary programme in Navi Mumbai on Monday. The move comes in the run-up to the elections to the 111-member Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC).

Most political parties have begun preparations for the civic polls, with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is banking on its two MLAs — Ganesh Naik and Manda Mhatre — to swing a surprise, holding its State executive council in Nerul last month. The Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress too announced that they would contest the polls unitedly as the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), and a number of sitting BJP corporators have started joining the MVA.

MNS chief Raj Thackeray, jumping on the bandwagon, will address his party members in the city. “It is an honour for us that Raj saheb has decided to hold the anniversary programme in Navi Mumbai, outside Mumbai. This programme is meant to give us directions on party’s functioning for the next one year. We will follow what saheb tells us,” Gajanan Kale, MNS’s Navi Mumbai city president, said.

With the Sena joining hands with the Congress and NCP, the MNS has suddenly swung into its Hindutva avatar, hoping to cash in on the Sena-BJP vote bank. The party also held a protest march in Mumbai in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) recently, demanding that illegal Pakistani and Bangladeshi immigrants be thrown out.

Apart from Navi Mumbai, the MNS, with its new-found love for Hindutva, is targeting the 115-member Aurangabad Municipal Corporation polls. The party will be celebrating the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, as per the Hindu calendar, in the city.

On Sunday, right-wing Hindutva activist Milind Ekbote, who is also an accused in the Bhima-Koregaon violence, met Mr. Thackeray at the latter’s residence to invite him for a programme organised to mark the death anniversary of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, the son of Chhatrapati Shivaji.

According to sources, despite its pro-Hindutva campaign, the MNS is unlikely to join hands with the BJP and contest the polls. “Going by the history between the two parties, it will be difficult for us to immediately convince the voters about our alliance. We may have a few friendly fights, but alliance is not on the cards as of now,” a senior MNS functionary said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vwbv70/article31018686.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9BMRAJTHACKERAY1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ahead-of-civic-polls-mns-to-hold-anniversary-meet-in-navi-mumbai/article31018687.ece
361,2020/03/09,"Catholic women seek changes in policies, practices of church","Memorandum to Archbishop calls for equal participation

On International Women’s Day on Sunday, women have demanded equality in the Catholic Church of India. In a memorandum submitted to Cardinal Oswald Gracias, the Archbishop of Bombay who is also the president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India and advisor to Pope Francis, women have called for a prophetic church where their voices count, and demanded respect from the clergy in their communication.

“We seek changes in the policies, practices and structures of the church so that women can participate fully in its life and leadership,” said the memorandum, which has 140 signatures and is being circulated to gather more endorsements. “Every year, we celebrate International Women’s Day with the full support of the bishops and clergy, but the concerns and frustrations of women within the church remain the same. We have leadership training for women but there are no spaces for them to exercise this leadership,” it said.

Dr. Astrid Lobo Gajiwala, who was part of the group that handed over the memorandum to Father K.T. Emmanuel at the Holy Name Cathedral to pass it on to the cardinal, said the church has been very active in empowering women through education, legal aid, healthcare, sustainable development and self-help groups. “But when it comes to inviting women to sit at the decision-making table in the church, it stops short. Priesthood is reserved only for men, and governance is linked to priesthood. Until we have women priests, governance must be delinked from priesthood,” Dr. Gajiwala said.

The group wore white to signify their baptismal vows.

“In India, the Catholic bishops have issued a gender policy, but the church continues with a theology and structures that prevent equality. The patriarchal male hierarchy is justified as being ordained by god. So how is it possible to implement the policy in the church?” Dr. Gajiwala asked.

Much has also been said about addressing sexual abuse by the clergy, but the church is slow to act, she said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/osyeks/article31018673.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09bm-church,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/catholic-women-seek-changes-in-policies-practices-of-church/article31018674.ece

364,2020/03/09,AIDS Control Society employees stage protest,"Contract staff demand regularisation of service

The contract staff of the Pondicherry AIDS Control Society staged a dharna in front of the Head Post Office on Monday demanding regularisation of service.

Employees who took part in the dharna led by association office-bearer T.R. Seshachalam pointed out that about 70 staff were working in AIDS Control Society for more than 20 years on a contract basis for very low salary and had contributed to the Union Territory being declared low prevalence both among general population and high risk groups through a sustained campaign of awareness, counselling, voluntary testing and other interventions.

E. Vanidassane, president of the staff association, said that though they have made repeated representations to the Department of Health, no action had been taken so far. This was in spite of a letter of the Director of Finance, Department of AIDS Control, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, dated as far back as in August, 2014, addressed to the UT Health Secretary, that they had no objection if the State intends to regularise the staff working in the State AIDS Control Societies.

The letter had stated that while the National AIDS Control Programme as a centrally-sponsored scheme executing its work through State AIDS Control Societies was co-terminus with plan period, there was no provision for regularisation or continuation of contractual position or any other benefits.

However, in case State Governments intend to regularise the contractual staff, the Department had no objection to the same contingent to the fact that there would be no additional financial liability on the central government, and it would be the State’s responsibility in case of dissolution of concerned State AIDS Control Societies.

The contract staff said even though they worked with utmost risk while caring for patients with HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B and C, they were denied patient care allowance.

The staff propose to continue with their dharna unless their grievance is addressed.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/uwi8ar/article31026475.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10PONDYPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/aids-control-society-employees-stage-protest/article31026476.ece

366,2020/03/09,"Awareness, early screening key to treating glaucoma","Exhibition throws light on the ‘sneak thief of sight’

A series of paintings on inspiring figures ranging from Mother Teresa and Subramania Bharati to Mirra Alfassa, or The Mother, who founded Auroville and former President APJ Abdul Kalam has been hosted at the Gandhi Thidal as part of a campaign to raise glaucoma awareness.

The exhibition, jointly organised by Aravind Eye Hospital and Puducherry Municipality, throws light on the “sneak thief of sight”, which is an oft-cited epithet for one of the important causes for irreversible blindness caused by a condition where the visual nerve gets damaged because of the rise in pressure within the eye.

This disease has no warning symptoms till it reaches an advanced stage and because of its irreversible nature, it is important to get screened at the stage.

Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness and the top cause of irreversible blindness in the world. In India, more than 12 million people are affected by this disease, but only 5-10% are aware about it.

S. Sivakumar, Commissioner, Puducherry Municipality, opened the exhibition on Saturday in the presence of V. Govindaradjou, president, Rotary club of Pondicherry Elites.

The exhibition curated by R. Venkatesh, Chief Medical Officer of Aravind Eye Hospital, was hosted as part of the World Glaucoma Week, which is a joint initiative of the World Glaucoma Association and the World Glaucoma Patient Association.

According to slides exhibited at the event, glaucoma more commonly affects people beyond the age of 40. So it is recommended that everyone must have a regular eye checkup after this age.

A positive family history has been proven to be a strong risk factor for glaucoma. Strengthening family screening and bringing awareness in families and communities will help reduce blindness due to glaucoma.

As there are very few symptoms in the earlier stages of glaucoma, most people are unaware till the time they lose significant amount of vision. Early diagnosis can reduce progression of the disease and prevent blindness. Since staying informed is the first step to tackle glaucoma, there is a great need to create public awareness on the importance of periodic screening, Aravind Hospital said.

Screening at Jipmer

Jipmer’s Opthalmology department will be screening public and health care workers of the institution for glaucoma in the Eye OPD from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. from (Monday) to March 14 (Saturday). The glaucoma screening is done by checking the eye pressure by a non-contact method and examining the optic nerve using a fundus camera, Subashini Kaliaperumal, Professor and Head of Ophthalmology, Jipmer, said.

369,2020/03/09,Vehicles with goods protruding have a free run,"Trucks and light commercial vehicles carrying long iron rods pose danger to other road users in Puducherry

Despite a ban by the Centre on trucks and mini-vans carrying iron rods, angles and pipes protruding beyond the body frame, a large number of goods vehicles carrying these continue to have a free run, thanks to poor enforcement by the authorities.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways had deleted the provision in the Central Motor Vehicle Rules (CMVR), 1989, that allowed protrusions of up to one metre beyond the body frames. The Ministry had amended the rules and issued a notification in 2014 to ensure that the materials carried in a truck remained within the vehicle’s length.

However, poor policing has resulted in vehicles having a free run. Trucks and goods vehicles carrying iron roads and pipes that protrude outside the vehicle’s body frame are a common sight across the city, especially on the arterial Kamaraj Salai, Anna Salai, 100-feet Road and the East Coast Road. The transport authorities have not been able to curb the menace even after several accidents were reported resulting in fatalities.

“Traffic scenario is perilous and the negligent manner in which goods, particularly iron rods are being carried in most of the busy thoroughfares, adds to the hardship of the road users. One can see that on most of the thoroughfares long iron rods and other hardware are transported without concern for other road users, particularly two-wheeler riders,” said S. Nadarajan, a resident.

“There is every possibility of the rods being dangerous to the safety of the vehicle riders and the traffic authorities should ensure that the hardware are carried with strict adherence to the traffic norms. Puducherry has perhaps the most dangerous zones with violation of road norms being the rule more than an exception,” he said.

The city has witnessed several accidents, where motorists and car drivers were injured after ramming their vehicles into trucks and mini vans carrying protruding materials.

Most of these vehicles do not have any warning signs, including blinkers, resulting in accidents. According to a senior official, “Goods vehicles seldom follow basic guidelines such as putting up a red cloth or blinkers at the rear to indicate it was carrying dangerously placed goods. There have been several instances when the vehicles slow down without any indication and the motorists or drivers of cars coming behind would be caught unaware resulting in a fatal accident.”

Although surprise checks are conducted at times, there is little enforcement on the highways or arterial roads.

‘Crackdown needed’

Strict enforcement of the law was the need of the hour and the authorities should crack down on erring drivers, the residents said.

According to a transport official, “Vehicles carrying iron rods protruding beyond the body frame is punishable under Section 190 (3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Though it is a compoundable offence and on-the-spot fine could be imposed on erring drivers, the authorities have not been able to rein them in as the revised Motor Vehicles Act is yet to be notified.”

At present, punishment for carrying protruding cargo under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, is ₹1,000 for the first offence and ₹2,000 for subsequent offences.

The amended provisions of the Act relating to imposition of on-the-spot fines and heavy penalties prescribed under the Act has been sent to the territorial government. The revised amount for which offences can be compounded has to be approved by the government, the official added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/melhko/article31017664.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THPONDYUTMATTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/vehicles-with-goods-protruding-have-a-free-run/article31017666.ece
370,2020/03/09,Grandma goes to school,"While all possibility of learning seem lost, a glimmer of hope arrives in the form of an awe-inspiring aunt.

The story so far: Grandma is married off and finds her new home in the village different. She misses her home, family and most of all, school.

Then came a fresh excitement. After a few days grandpa’s, uncle came to visit them with his wife. He was in Bihar Civil Service and lived in Ranchi. Although he was younger than grandpa’s father, it was he who looked after the entire family, took all major decisions and carried out all the plans. Everyone loved him and looked forward to his visits.

“Choto-ma is very modern and wears blouses,” whispered grandma’s sister-in-law. “She can also read books and speak in English.” Grandma had already discovered that unlike the city, most women in the village did not wear blouses, especially at home.

Grandma was really impressed by kakamoni (that’s what they called grandpa’s uncle) and choto-ma.

“So, you are Sarojini?” said choto-ma with a smile as she lifted the pallu of grandma’s sari. “I hear you have been to school and can read?”

“Yes,” whispered grandma. “But there are no books here.”

Choto-ma laughed. “We’ll see what we can do,” she said. “Would you really like to study?”

“Yes, oh yes!” cried grandma eagerly.

Everyone seemed awestruck by choto-ma who was competent and confident about everything.

New chances

“Did you go to school?” grandma asked her.

“Oh no. There are no schools for girls where my father worked. But I had a governess.”

“What’s a governess?” asked grandma curiously.

“A lady who came to teach me at home,” replied choto-ma. “She was English. My father engaged her because he wanted me to learn English and other things. She taught me for nearly three years.”

“What else did she teach you?” asked Anu, grandma’s sister-in-law.

“Sewing. Playing the organ. Singing and dressing properly,” said choto-ma.

“If only I could read more books!” sighed grandma.

“Perhaps you will,” said choto-ma, her eyes twinkling. “One never knows what the future may bring!”

371,2020/03/09,Paw-mise to take care,"These four-legged furry creatures need proper care and we need to keep that in mind before adopting them.

Have you heard the saying ‘A dog is a man’s best friend?’ Well, first of all it should be ‘Dog is a person’s best friend’, because any sentence with the word ‘man’ that can just as easily use the word ‘woman’ is gendered. We must say person or people, okay?

Anyway, people say that dogs are the most loyal and loving companions a human can have, but I don’t think the opposite is true. Are humans as loyal and loving to their dogs?

Did you know that in the last seven years in Bengaluru, over 1300 pedigree and rare dog breeds have been abandoned in animal shelters? And that’s pedigrees abandoned in shelters. There are so many more left on the road to fend for themselves.

Sad reality

People abandon their dogs because they are leaving town, or getting married or having kids. But it’s also because dogs are a lot of hard work and need to be taken care of. Not many people think about that before they get them. All they think of is that they are going to get a cute and fluffy playmate that they can teach to do tricks like ‘shake hands’, ‘roll over’ and ‘play dead’. But there is a lot more to having a dog than that. Till they are potty trained, they will pee and poop all over your house. Even in your shoes. How do I know that? Well, let’s just say I ALWAYS check inside my shoes now before I put them on. Plus, they chew everything — and I mean everything — your socks, your Lego, the TV remote and even your underwear. In fact, the grosser the thing, the more they like to chew on it.

You also have to make a lot of adjustments when you get a dog. You can’t just decide to go on a trip because who will take care of your dog when you are gone? You need to come home at a certain time to make sure they get their food. And some people forget that small dogs can grow to become very big dogs that need exercise. On weekends, I am on duty with our dog, and I have to take him on all his walks. Even if I want to go play cricket or am in the middle of watching TV. I have to stop what I am doing and take him out. I won’t lie. I don’t always want to, but I know I have to. If I wanted a dog, I should look after him too.

In return, dogs give back so much more. They know when you are sad and come and lick your face. They let you lie on their soft tummies while you watch TV. And they are more than happy to eat that extra roti you don’t want.

So before you bug your parents to get you a dog, think about whether you and your family have the time to look after one. And if you are sure you do, instead of buying one, why not adopt one and give it a second chance at having a loving home?",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/euf9pf/article31022383.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13YTBUGBOYjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/paw-mise-to-take-care/article31022384.ece
372,2020/03/09,Thousands of women flock to Thiruvananthapuram for Attukal Pongala today,"The State government issued a set of dos and don’ts for the devotees with more people testing positive for COVID-19 since Sunday

The annual Attukal Pongala festival began on Monday with thousands of brick hearths being lit across Kerala’s Capital with the chief priest of the Attukal Bhagavathy Temple lighting the ‘Pandara Aduppu’ — the main hearth — and passing down the flame.

Women devotees have flocked in their thousands to make the Pongala offering to the presiding deity of the Attukal Bhagavathy Temple even as Kerala launched a fresh battle against the COVID-19.

The State remains on high alert after six people, including a three-year-old child, tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday and Monday.

On Sunday, the State government issued a set of dos and don’ts for the devotees after five people in the neighbouring Pathanamthitta district tested positive for COVID-19. The number rose to six on Monday.

The government would also initiate action against a hotel in the city which allowed foreigners to perform Pongala outside the hotel premises, he said.

The Attukal Pongala, described as the biggest congregation of women, is also known as the women’s Sabarimala.

People with travel history to countries affected by COVID-19 and others who have come into contact with them have been advised to stay away from the festival. They have been directed to make the Pongala offering at their residences or other places of stay if they are determined.

Health teams, ambulances in place

Several health teams and ambulances have been deployed across the festival zone, which covers a 10-km radius with the temple at its centre.

The government has also stepped up surveillance at airports across the State.

The sanctification ceremony would be held at 2.10 p.m. The ‘Chooralkuthu’ ritual will be held at 7.30 p.m. In all, 830 boys are participating in the ritual this year. A procession bearing the deity will leave the Attukal Temple for the Sastha Temple at nearby Manacaud at 10.30 p.m.

Fourteen 108 ambulances deployed for Pongala duty also were flagged off by the Minister.

Each ‘bike first responder’ will have an emergency medical technician and a HAM radio operator.

They will provide first aid to patients and, if needed, alert the ambulances for shifting them to the hospital.

The 108 ambulances will be deployed at Attukal, Thampanoor, Killiapalam, Karamana, Manacaud Junction, East Fort, Kamaleswaran Junction, Kalady, Power House Road, Konchiravila, Kallummoodu, bypass, and Manacaud Valiyapalli Junction.

374,2020/03/09,Tight surveillance in place for Attukal pongala,"People with fever, cold, cough should avoid pongala

With five new cases of COVID-19 infections reported in the State, the Thiruvananthapuram district administration has placed Monday’s Attukal pongala under tight surveillance.

Individuals with travel history to COVID-19- affected countries and persons who have come into contact with them should confine themselves to their homes, hotels, or other places of stay.

People with fever, cold, and cough should avoid the pilgrimage.

If they do offer the Pongala, it is ideal they offer it at their places of stay, the administration said.

Quarantine

People who have arrived from China, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Iran, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Nepal after February 20 should compulsorily remain quarantined for 28 days.

The City Corporation will compile video footage of the pilgrims so that they can be traced quickly if someone develops COVID-19 symptoms, District Collector K. Gopalakrishnan said.

As many as 23 health teams have been deployed in the festival region. Twelve ambulances and five motorcycle ambulances also will be on call.

Pilgrims have been advised to avoid touching hand rails.

Wash hands

If they come into contact with railings, hands should be immediately washed.

The Attukal Temple Trust, on the instructions of the Health Department, is taking steps to disinfect hand rails on the temple premises every half hour, a temple official said.

The district administration has urged pilgrims to stand in queue for darshan at the temple, maintaining an arm’s length from other devotees.

They have also been advised to avoid hugs and hand shakes.

The administration has also advised people with fever, cold, or cough to seek medical care at the nearest public health facility.

Pilgrims who notice such persons should immediately inform the control room or the district administration on 0471-2459126, 1077 (toll free) and 1056 (Disha), the district administration said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/2wiwsi/article31020663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tv-corona-pongalacol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/tight-surveillance-in-place/article31018335.ece
375,2020/03/09,Attukal Pongala: Devotees unfazed by COVID-19,"Many, however, unaware of five more persons testing positive for the virus in Pathanamthitta

Devotees, some of them thronging the heart of the city since Saturday to offer Pongala, did not seem too worried about the COVID-19 disease and reposed their faith in the Attukal Devi.

Most of them were not aware of the five new cases that had tested positive for COVID-19 from Pathanamthitta.

Shailaja from Kayamkulam, who had reached East Fort at 5 a.m. on Sunday, had completely missed the news of the fresh COVID-19 cases.

A Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) worker, she is a regular at the Pongala here and said she did not think twice before deciding to come here.

“Till now, I have not been worried about it.”

Shailaja had been keeping track of safety precautions announced on radio and TV.

Medicine for cough

She said she had even gone to a government homoeo dispensary in the city to get medicines for a cough she had.

Nisha and Smitha, both of them employed at the Naval Base, have been camping here since Saturday afternoon.

They said they were aware of the precautions to be taken against COVID-19 and were using masks to keep their faces covered when they stepped outside. They were a bit apprehensive but had no doubt that their faith would keep them away from any disease.

Sooraj, a B.Com. student who was accompanying his mother Soosamma, said many people were walking around with their faces covered with cloth or masks but doubted it would offer any real protection if someone with COVID-19 was present among the devotees.

Ms. Soosamma said her faith in the deity of Attukal would protect them.

Differing voice

Sooraj, though, disagreed with his mother.

“One cannot ignore medical science,” he said.

Though they had seen no printed advisory, regular announcements were being made by the organisers about the spread of the disease and the precautions to be taken, they said.

Usha Chandran, a homemaker from near Oachira, said she was not the least apprehensive about COVID-19 despite the crowds here, but Vijayamma, a MGNREGS workers, said though she too was not worried initially, the reports of confirmed cases were a cause for concern.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/3g3jo9/article31018331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09TVATTUKALPONGALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/pongala-devotees-unfazed-by-covid-19/article31018332.ece

Four people are admitted to the isolation ward of the General Hospital.

Results awaited

So far, the results of 88 of 100 samples sent for tests have been received. All have tested negative for COVID-19. The results of the 12 remaining samples are awaited, the district administration said.

Hotels in the district have been directed to inform the District Police Chief, the district administration, and the District Medical Officer (DMO) of the presence of foreigners.

377,2020/03/09,Women ATCs take over air traffic on women’s day,"10 officers in charge, exchange wishes with women pilots

Pilots of aircraft negotiating the airspace under the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport were in for a surprise on Sunday on hearing women’s voices through radio telephony.

For six hours from 7 a.m., all the flights that landed and took off from Thiruvananthapuram and the flight operations for Cochin, Madurai, Coimbatore, Trichy, Agatti, and Tuticorin airports that come under Thiruvananthapuram Area Control jurisdiction were handled by 10 women Air Traffic Controllers.

Some of the pilots exchanged International Women’s Day wishes after hearing the women’s voices through radio telephony.

The all-women team was elated when the woman pilot of an Indigo flight that came from Bengaluru to Thiruvananthapuram and the women pilots of Air India flights extended greetings to them. “Although we could not see each other, the pilots recognised our voice and greeted us. The greetings from the women pilots was a surprise,” one of the women controllers said.

16 women

Although there are 16 women in the 69-member team of Air Traffic Controllers in Thiruvananthapuram under the Joint General Manager, Air Traffic Management, M. Balachandran Nair, the task of managing the airspace from Agatti in the west to Tiruchirappalli in the east, from Kozhikode in the north to around 400 km from Thiruvananthapuram in the south of the premier airport by an all-women team was rare.

Vital operational positions namely tower, surface movement control, area radar, and approach radar were handled by these 10 women led by P.B. Jayanthi, Joint GM (ATM) and shift-in-charge. Till 1 p.m., these women Air Traffic Controllers multitasked — to communicate with pilots, avoid collisions, peruse radar screen, and talk to adjacent controllers units, all at the same time with zero margin for error.

The en-route overflying flights operating from Colombo and South East Asian countries like Singapore and Malaysia to the Gulf region and European sector and vice versa were controlled by them.

Around 3,000 police personnel have been designated for the security arrangements in the city for the Attukal Pongala. The security force will be boosted by a contingent of the Tamil Nadu police.

The premises of the temple and the peripheral areas have been divided into four zones, each led by Assistant Commissioners, for streamlining security arrangements.

Control room

Besides the control room of the City police, a special control room has also been set up to monitor the live feed from the surveillance cameras.

Bike patrols, shadow police, and Pink police teams will also be deployed to various parts of the city to handle exigencies that could arise.

Restrictions will also be imposed for constructing stages and arches that obstruct the path of vehicles and inconvenience the public. The police have also cautioned against using loudspeakers beyond the permitted noise levels.

Traffic will be regulated in the city until 8 p.m. on Monday. Heavy vehicles, including tipper lorries, cement mixers, container trucks, and goods-laden vehicles will be required to bypass the city roads. Besides, restrictions will be imposed on vehicular flow from Manacaud to Attukal until the end of the Pongala festival.

379,2020/03/09,Mention of Pakistan lands KU in a spot,"Teachers’ application forms found not to have changed since post-Partition time

At a time when the topic of citizenship remains a political hot potato, the University of Kerala has landed in the soup over a contentious question intended for migrants from Pakistan (in the post-partition era) in its application forms for appointments to teaching posts.

The callous attitude of the university authorities has invited the wrath of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government that has been on the forefront of the resistance against the Centre’s efforts to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens.

Inquiry ordered

The university waded into the controversy after an applicant flagged the presence of the question [“Are you a person migrated from Pakistan?” (sic)] in the application form issued by the institution.

On being alerted by Alathur MLA K.D. Prasannan, Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel ordered an immediate inquiry into the lapse.

It subsequently came to light that the 83-year-old university, one of the earliest universities in the country, has inadvertently been replicating questions in its application forms since the post-Partition period when several families had migrated from Pakistan to settle in various parts of India.

As part of the inquiry, the university rummaged through its archives to find hard copies of several application forms as old as those issued since 1984. Curiously, barring the fonts and the alignment, the forms have not undergone much change and many questions remain the same. Having admitted its oversight, the university has promised that its forms will be reviewed with immediate effect.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/mention-of-pakistan-lands-ku-in-a-spot/article31018229.ece
380,2020/03/09,4 crore litres of septage in city,"The waste, which once ended up in waterbodies, is treated at Muttathara plant

Ever since the city Corporation launched a licensing system for private vehicles collecting septage on April 18 last year, it has managed to collect as much as 4.2 crore litres of septage waste from across city. All of this waste, which once used to end up in waterbodies and public roads, is now treated at the Muttathara sewage treatment plant.

For the civic body, the licensing has become a revenue source, which had remained untapped all along. In the past eleven months, the Corporation has collected ₹2.42 crore as fees from the collection of septage waste from houses, flats, and institutions in the city. Out of this, around ₹60 lakh will be the Corporation’s share while the rest goes as payment to the private tankers employed for the purpose and other expenses.

Regulation of practice

“The main intention of the licensing is not revenue generation. Before the system was introduced, illegal operators used to run the whole thing without any rules. The sewage treatment plant at Muttathara never got any septage waste from these operators. We never knew how they used to treat the massive amount of septage they collected. Naturally, a large amount used to be dumped in waterbodies and in secluded areas within the city. When this problem mounted, the Corporation decided to introduce the licensing system. This has paid off now,” said an official of the city Corporation’s health wing.

The septage collecting trucks hardly ever remain idle as requests are logged in through the day on the Smart Trivandrum mobile application as well as at a call centre. Each of the trucks run at least three-four trips a day. The call centre is functioning at the Corporation from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on all days to coordinate the activities and to help those who are not familiar with online booking.

381,2020/03/09,Champions League | Tottenham faces an uphill task,"Spectators to be allowed to watch in the game at Leipzig

The global virus outbreak will be the centre of attention when the Champions League resumes this week with second-leg matches in the round of 16.

After reaching the final last season, Tottenham has an uphill task against Leipzig to make the quarterfinals this time round. A 1-0 deficit must be overturned without a recognisable striker in the team with both Harry Kane and Son Heung-min injured.

The North London club is enduring a five-game winless run in all competitions that began with the first-leg loss to Leipzig.

Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho is grumbling about his squad shortages while preparing for the trip to Germany, complaining about the commitment of a fit player — record-signing Tanguy Ndombele.

German news agency DPA reported Monday that the game would go ahead as scheduled with fans, citing the Leipzig city government.

382,2020/03/09,I-League football | Mohun Bagan on the cusp of glory,"Kolkata giant is a win away from regaining crown

For former champion Mohun Bagan, regaining the I-League title now is a mere formality. Having already created a new mark with a 13-match unbeaten run, Bagan needs just two points to secure the crown that it last won in 2015.

Currently on 36 points from 15 matches, Bagan can make its final season in the I-League memorable if it wins at home against Aizawl FC at Kalyani Stadium on Tuesday.

It will also mean that Bagan becomes the second team after Dempo FC (in 2009-2010) to ensure the title with four rounds to spare.

Bagan’s task became easier on Monday after traditional rival East Bengal got the better of Real Kashmir FC with an injury-time winner in Srinagar.

With most sides having five more rounds to play, the best any of Bagan’s challengers can now manage is 38 points. A win over Aizawl will thus be enough to make Bagan’s position at the top unassailable.

Bagan’s Spanish head coach, Kibu Vicuna, adopted a professional stance on the eve of the match that in all likelihood will bring a historic triumph to his side.

“Aizawl is playing well and is a difficult side to beat. We need to bring out our best if we want to get the result that we are looking for,” said Vicuna as he adopted a cautious approach especially after the hard-earned draw in the last match at home against holder Chennai City FC.

Key players suspended

Bagan’s earlier meeting with Aizawl — the opening round match at the latter’s home three months ago — ended goalless.

What made Vicuna even more circumspect was the fact that the host will be missing key defender Francisco Morante owing to suspension.

Despite lying ninth currently, Aizawl has done fairly well in its last five outings securing eight points, most of which came from ‘away’ engagements.

“The pressure is on them (Bagan) now as they drew their last match with Chennai City.

“My players are ready to take them on and are looking forward for a positive result.

385,2020/03/09,Man United complete double over Man City with 2-0 home win,"The second-placed Manchester City is now 25 points adrift of Liverpool

Manchester United completed their first home and away Premier League double over Manchester City since the Alex Ferguson era with goals from Anthony Martial and Scott McTominay giving them a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford on Sunday.

United's triumph over second-placed City leaves runaway leaders Liverpool, who have a 25-point advantage, even closer to the title but not even that bitter-sweet element of the win could dampen the celebrations in the Stretford End.

Liverpool now require only two more wins to guarantee lifting their first league title for 30 years and may not even need those six points if City fail to beat Arsenal and Burnley in their upcoming games before the Merseyside derby.

United may have had to defend for large parts of the second half but they were disciplined throughout and allowed City few clear chances after taking the lead in the 30th minute through Martial after a clever free-kick from Bruno Fernandes.

The arrival of Portuguese midfielder Fernandes in late January has transformed United's season and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's improving side are now unbeaten in their last 10 games in all competitions.

The creativity and verve of Fernandes has been key to that upturn in form, but there have been improvements across the field as United have moved up to fifth, still three points off the fourth Champions League spot currently held by Chelsea.

But no-one in Manchester needs reminding that fifth place may be enough to face the continental elite next term, if City's two-year UEFA ban from Europe is upheld despite their appeal.

Shaky start

United were shaky in the opening stages, sitting deep and allowing City space to move the ball around midfield, but after adjusting they began to take advantage of the absence of the injured Kevin De Bruyne from the City midfield.

United's opening goal was straight off the training ground with Fernandes surprising City's defence with a sharply-taken chipped free-kick over the top to Martial whose volley sneaked under the arm of the diving Ederson.

It was a goal which delighted Norwegian Solskjaer who has been pushing Martial to gain more of a predator's instinct and it was one of several signs of a good understanding between the Frenchman and Fernandes.

“Anthony and Bruno have hit if off. It is a privilege to be a manager of a squad with this attitude. You can't ask for more. They are going to improve as players as well,” said Solskjaer.

City had a Sergio Aguero effort ruled out for offside after the break but with Bernardo Silva unusually ineffective, the champions lacked their trademark midfield dominance.

Raheem Sterling was unable to connect with a low ball across the face of the goal from Riyad Mahrez in one of the few clear openings City created.

Raucous joy

At the other end, the speedy Dan James broke clear after a wonderful through ball from the outstanding Aaron Wan-Bissaka but opted to blast at Ederson when he could have squared the ball to a team mate.

But the game was to end in raucous joy for the United faithful as substitute McTominay made sure of the points by driving the ball into the unguarded net from 25 metres after a woeful throw-out from Ederson straight to the midfielder.

“That was such a sweet moment. It's such a beautiful feeling to score like that in front of the fans. But we cant get too carried away and need to keep pushing for the Champions League,” said the Scotland international.

“We will take confidence from that but in the coming weeks we have got to keep the run going,” he said.

Guardiola defended his team's performance but Bernardo Silva was more frank in his assessment.

“A very bad day for us, it is always a special game even though we are not going for the title. It is a special game for our fans and us and we need to do better. It is not acceptable to play this way and lose like this,” he said.

386,2020/03/09,La Liga | Real Madrid lose at Betis to hand top spot back to Barcelona,"Real are now second on 56 points after 27 games, two behind Barca who beat Real Sociedad 1-0 on Saturday to regain first place.

Real Madrid failed to build on last week's 'Clasico' victory as they lost 2-1 at Real Betis in a fiery match on Sunday and surrendered top spot in La Liga to Barcelona.

Former Barca forward Cristian Tello grabbed the decisive late goal that saw his old team regain the lead in the see-saw title race.

Real are now second on 56 points after 27 games, two behind Barca who beat Real Sociedad 1-0 on Saturday to regain first place a week after losing 2-0 at the Bernabeu.

Betis had gone ahead in the 40th minute after a moment of confusion as they appealed for a penalty when Sergio Ramos collided into Nabil Fekir but the loose ball landed at the feet of defender Sidnei who rifled it into the roof of the net.

The Brazilian's joy was cut short when he was penalised for tripping Marcelo in the area and Karim Benzema converted from the spot, his first goal in seven matches in all competitions.

Betis captain Joaquin missed an open goal in the second half and Real defender Ferland Mendy hammered a shot against the bar but Tello decided an end-to-end game in the 82nd minute, keeping his composure to beat Thibaut Courtois and find the net.

His goal ensured a third defeat in four matches in all competitions for Madrid, who had also lost their last away game against Levante and were beaten in the Champions League by Manchester City last month.

“The result is fair and we have to take a hard look at ourselves, we did not play well at all,” said Real captain Sergio Ramos.

“It's a real shame we weren't able to hold on to our place at the top of the table but just as we didn't go crazy after beating Barca, we're not going to spend the next week tearing our hair out over this defeat. “There are lots of points left to fight for but if we want to be champions we cannot afford to waste more opportunities like the one we had today.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/8ia6q1/article31020562.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SPAINSOCCERLALIGATHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/la-liga-real-madrid-lose-at-betis-to-hand-top-spot-back-to-barcelona/article31020563.ece
