1,['24/03/2020'],Pramod Shetty: Pramod Shetty wanted to be a racer,"When actor Pramod Shetty posted a picture of a teal vintage car with the caption, ‘Long time memory’, it got many wondering just what he meant. As it turns out, Pramod has just celebrated 20 years in theatre, but tells us that acting for the stage, or cinema, was not in his scheme of things back then. “I wanted to be a racer. My passion was attending rallies and participating in them. My love for cars was well known in my family. In fact, using a yellow vintage car in Kirik Party was my suggestion and I had made it my mission to find the perfect car, which we finally did,” he says. Such was his craze for motorsports that Pramod would go as far as Chitradurga to participate in races. And when he was not in the driver’s seat, he would make watch others race. “I learnt to drive when I was eight; my first tutor being a driver called Paddu. By the time I was in Class 10, my family would let me drive them from Mangaluru to Kundapura,” he shares.So, how did acting figure in his scheme of things? “Back when I was in college, there was a drama competition and I participated for a lark. There was no role as such; I was just another face in the crowd. But to my surprise, I enjoyed it. I went back for more,” says the actor, who went from theatre to TV and back, before finding a niche in cinema.“I debuted in films with Jugaari, but I remember being bored during the shoot, because I was used to the hyperactive ways of theatre,” says the actor, who didn’t do films for a while, until Ulidavaru Kandante (UK) came his way. “When Rakshit Shetty was casting for Dinesha in UK, Rishab Shetty got him to meet me. I refused the role at first, but Rishab insisted. The 12 days that I shot for the film in Kundapura was an experience that changed me. I’ve done 26 films in the past six years, each with a widely varied role. If I were to pick my favourites, it’d be Dinesha, Upadhyaya from Sarkari Hiriya Prathamika Shaale Kasaragodu and Tukaram from Avane Srimannarayana. My philosophy has always been the same — never do a role for money. Do it because you love it,” he says.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74777397,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-277001/74777397.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/pramod-shetty-wanted-to-be-a-racer/articleshow/74777397.cms

‘Now, I am forced to binge watch’

‘I’ve got to spend more time in our farm’

What’s on his plate at home…

Vijay recalls his First-time skydiving experience in NZ

Lockdown, social isolation — these are words that we hear, read and are almost drilled into our conscience these days to fight the spread of Coronavirus . But finding a way out of boredom that comes with it is up to us. Here’s how Chennai paiyyan, namma Vijay Shankar is fighting it — boredom.It’s been a month since I came back to Chennai after the India A tour of New Zealand. Once I came back, I was busy with the league matches in Chennai. Now, it’s been a week since everything has come to a halt. At home, I do basic strength training. I do deadlifts, squats, etc. I also have loop bands and power bands at home. I use them as well for doing exercises. But I don’t know how long I can last like this. Because all I know is to play cricket . However, not often we get to be at home and spend time with family. So, I am enjoying that at the moment.Generally, I am not someone who binge watch anything. However, I have no other go now. I just finished watching The Test: A New Era for Australia Team (a series on how the Australian men’s cricket team rebuilt its reputation after the 2018 sandpaper scandal). I am sure most of the cricketers would have watched it. Or sometimes, I sit and watch the highlights of some old matches.We’ve a farm on ECR, close to Mahabalipuram. I went there a couple of days ago. I think I should be going there more often since I have a lot of time now. It’s a great place to relax and unwind, and get to learn the basics of cultivation from the workers there. We’ve got vegetables, fruits, groundnuts, etc. It’s been close to a year since we bought this place and now we’ve started getting the produce from there for our kitchen.A proper south Indian meal for lunch is what I enjoy the most since I am at home. And I don’t mind eating dosa every day. I love it.It wasn’t planned at all. I am generally someone who only thinks about cricket and cricket-related stuff. We had some free time after India A tour in New Zealand. So, Sandeep Warrier and I decided to go to Queenstown. And we decided to try bungee jumping and sky diving. It wasn’t even planned, so we had no time to think if it would be scary at all. It was really a good experience.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74776222,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-623194,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/coronalockdown-home-workouts-and-visits-to-farm-keep-vijay-shankar-occupied/articleshow/74776222.cms

Then, as the requests kept pouring in, I began thinking to myself about the feasibility of a sequel. I sat with my team and discussed a few scenarios that could be woven into a story. Eventually there was one that appealed to me and I decided to go with that,” says Krishna, adding that he began writing the story about a fortnight ago.“We plan on retaining most of the characters from the original. While Love Mocktail was about the need to move on in life, the sequel will follow what actually happens in their lives. The treatment will comical, even though the story will have some bittersweet moments. We are looking at locking the script for now and then will take off with the filming this year itself,” says Krishna.The original film also starred Amrutha Iyengar and Milana Nagaraj in the lead.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74776201,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-116836/74776201.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/love-mocktails-sequel-will-retain-its-characters-krishna/articleshow/74776201.cms
4,['24/03/2020'],Bored at home? Pursue activities online now,"We are a generation that has made the most of technology to ensure that even our basic needs are taken care of at the click of a mouse. There is an app for pretty much everything out there. So, it comes as no surprise that citizens stuck at home during the Covid-19 shutdown are turning to technology to ensure that their day-to-day routines are as minimally impacted as possible. Activities that were hitherto conducted in person, like fitness, dance and music classes, to name a few, have all gone online.With public spaces shut and classes suspended, extracurricular activities like dance and music lessons, too, have been affected. Simran Godhwani, a Kathak dancer and instructor, says, “Since we have closed our dance school right now, parents of my students wanted the classes to continue, which is when we decided to take things online. So, now we have been conducting group classes via an online app that enables multiple people to join the session, which is live streamed, ensuring that the students do not miss out on anything.”Violinist Ambi Subramaniam, who also conducts music classes in the city with his sister Bindu, says that in the wake of the COVID-19 scare, they shifted everything online. “All our in-person classes are now online, which is a temporary solution. Hopefully, once the government relaxes the shutdown, we can continue as usual,” says Ambi, adding that they have also launched a free global music class for people around the world. “Right now, people have a lot of time on their hands and are looking for things to do. We launched World Music Wednesday, where we will teach music from around the world. Parents, especially, are looking at keeping their kids engaged, so this will be a good time to learn something and spend their time productively at home,” he says.“We have fixed slots for our fitness classes, which we have now taken online. All that the customer has to do is tune in to the live session on a computer or smartphone and follow instructions, like he/she would in a physical class. Right now, online sessions for strength training, cardio, yoga, and dance fitness are being conducted and can be accessed on any internet-enabled gadget. Since its launch, we have seen a considerable increase in the number of people using our live sessions,” says Ankit Nagori, co-founder of an online platform for food, fitness and meditation.Another online health and fitness coaching portal has witnessed a similar response. “In the past 10 days, we’ve seen an increased engagement (as much as 15%) in the community due to our twice-a-day Live Workout Sessions,” says Jitendra Chouksey, founder of a Pune-based health and fitness start-up, adding that the social media engagement of the app has also increased in the same time frame.While schools and coaching centres that had their academic calendars upset by the shutdown have turned to online tutoring, either with recorded or live sessions, it’s not all work and no play for the young ones or their parents.“There are webinars that parents and kids can bond over, like, for instance, one about setting up a fish tank. My kids were quite engrossed in it and want to do it now,” says Gowthami Saraf, mother of two. “I have enrolled for a mathematics course to brush up my analytical skills,” says Varun G, a software engineer who adds that there are many fun online courses available for people of all age groups. “I have enrolled for a virtual marathon and cyclothon event. A virtual race is a race that can be run from any location you choose. You can run, jog, or walk on the road, on the trail, on the treadmill at the gym or on the track and you get to time it yourself. I am excited about it,” says fitness enthusiast Manohar K, who wanted to try running online instead of going to the streets or parks.Charu Jain, a Bengaluru-based illustrator, plans to conduct art workshops online. “In times like this, when we are receiving so much information and most of it is so scary and negative, I wanted to spread some cheer through art. Several parents got in touch with me and wanted me to come up with something for their kids, so I thought ‘why not?’ In fact, a lot of people responded to my post that I had to eventually turn off comments,” says Charu.Dancer and actress Ragini Chandran, who is also conducting workout sessions online these days says that though several people have taken to it, giving participants personal attention is an issue. “If we have a live session, we can’t give them personal attention, so, for a week now, I have been recording videos, and sending it to my students and asking them to send me their version of it, so that I can share my feedback. It is a challenge, especially for beginners,” she says.Simran adds that one of the biggest challenges of conducting classes online is technology its elf. “When we conduct group sessions, not everyone is on the same bandwidth and internet speed, which sometimes causes a lag. Also, my instructions have to be precise, as I am not present physically, where I can teach them and correct them inperson,” says Simran.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74777127,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-167232/74777127.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/bored-at-home-pursue-activities-online-now/articleshow/74777127.cms

""So you're looking at the 'P' word - postponement.""They're going to explore options with the Japanese of course, and then there all kinds of stakeholders -- international federations, NOCs, athletes.""And then in four weeks they're going to try and come out with a plan B and make it as specific as they can make it in that time period.""Pound, who is Canadian, said the ""astonishing"" spread of COVID-19 across the globe left the IOC with no other choice.""This is not something that's going to clear up by July 24,"" Pound said.""And this thing isn't going to go away by September or October. A lot of the biggest countries in the world are just about overwhelmed, and it's just starting to take root in Africa.

18,['24/03/2020'],India Power Consumption: Ready to tackle supply shock due to demand swing: Govt,"NEW DELHI: At a time when India increasignly gets confined to work-from-home and needs 24X7 power, the country’s grid system is fully geared to maintain operational stability and avoid any supply shock due to sudden demand swing due to the economic impact of coronavirus pandemic, power minister R K Singh told TOI on Monday.Ministry sources told TOI the national grid operator POSOCO is putting in laying down a regimen to be followed if the system comes under pressure due to a combination of several factors, especially demand-side mismatch and high renewable content in generation basket.Singh said India’s arterial distribution network is technologically one of the best in the world and has the advantage of being a “one-nation-one-grid” under a single controller. “Eleven renewable energy management centres and static precipitators have been added to deal with intermittency of renewables and hydel projects can now be switched on quickly to manage demand swing,” Singh said, adding the thermal plants have been given greater flexibility with lower operational threshold of 55%.“We haven’t seen any signal (pressure on grid) yet. (But) we are prepared to manage (demand-side mismatch),” he said.The International Energy Agency on Monday cautioned countries over grid instability and resultant blackouts, especially in less-developed systems, as coronavirus pandemic curtails economic activities and demand for power.Industry players explained that the Indian grid could come under pressure because of 10% renewable content in the generation basket. “Thermal generation can be curtailed in the day to accommodate renewable in the day when demand falls. But you won’t have renewables in the night and it will take 6-8 hours to switch on a thermal plant,” one industry source said.Executives at state-run NTPC, the largest generation utility in India, on Monday said there was no curtailment and generation stood at “usual levels”. They, however, did expect some curtailment if the coronavirus situation continues or worsens.According to the Central Electricity Authority , India’s total generation capacity stood at 3,69,427 MW. Renewable energy generation sources stood at 86,759 MW.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74784043,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-139730,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/grid-ready-to-tackle-power-swings-from-corona-impact-r-k-singh/articleshow/74783293.cms
19,['24/03/2020'],Suraj ‘sets’ his eyes on dream ISL move,"Panaji: Suraj Hadkonkar is making heads turn in the Goa Professional League with his signature freekicks for Dempo Sports Club .

The 24-year-old has played a stellar role for the former champions and has been a trump card for head coach Samir Naik, even though 19 of his 20 appearances so far have been from the bench.

Suraj has 10 goals in his kitty and half of them have come from set pieces. He is the club’s leading goal-scorer and overall fifth in the league, led by Sporting Clube de Goa forward Marcus Mascarenhas with 14 strikes. Churchill Brothers’ goal machine Willis Plaza and Clencio Pinto have 11 goals each, while FC Goa striker Aaren D’Silva is tied with Suraj on 10 goals.

“I have certainly improved form the last two seasons here at Dempo. This season has been very fruitful for me. I have worked hard, especially on freekicks. Coach always insists on practicing set pieces after our training sessions. That has helped me a lot,” Suraj told TOI.

While Suraj remembers his goal count, he has lost track of his assists. Dempo have only a game to play against Corps of Signals before they wind up their season. They are currently placed second with 41 points from 21 matches, three points behind leaders Sporting Clube who have played 20 games.

“I am comfortable playing in the first 11 as well as from the bench. The coach has shown faith in me and it is up to him to decide. He feels I am most effective in the second half as I have the ability to change the game. Opponents usually slow down and it gives me the right opportunities,” said Suraj.

Suraj has a point. Against Guardian Angel SC, Dempo were trailing by a goal when the coach decided to introduce Suraj. He made an impact with five minutes left for the break as he dribbled past two defenders and equalised with a blistering shot. In the second half, Dempo gained a freekick and not surprisingly, Suraj converted it. He then scored another one from open play and set up former international Joaquim Abranches as Dempo registered a comfortable 4-1 victory.

Suraj’s existing contract with Dempo comes to an end in May and he is confident that he can make the leap to a bigger league. He has certainly set his sights for a dream move in the Indian Super League (ISL) and can take inspiration from his former teammate Jessel Carneiro, who made a successful debut at the age of 29 for Kerala Blasters.

“I have been training hard throughout and feel positive. Hope something will work out for me next season after my performances,” said Suraj.

He has the right focus and attitude too. Probably, it’s only a matter of time before he makes the move.

You can't eat out or go for that long drive. For most working professional in India, working from home or under self-quarantine, this is how the last one week has looked like. With several companies across the country allowing – some mandating – work from home models for their employees, working professionals have begun to spend all their time at home. This, coupled with an absence of any avenue for recreation, has resulted in a lot of free time. Instead of sulking at home or bingewatching on shows (not judging those who do!), many work-from-homers have decided to utilise this extra time to indulge in hobbies.Many are rediscovering passions that they had to give up, largely due to the demands of their jobs and lives.

I would read for six to eight hours a day without break but it quickly reduced when I started working. I bought at least half a dozen books from the book fair last year. But I have not even touched them. Now that I am working from home, I have finally resumed reading. It will be the first book I will finish in years.""Then there are those who have used this free time to engage in new activities and hobbies or even learn new skills.

21,['24/03/2020'],Animal Assisted Therapy can help with stress and anxiety: Experts,"An interactive session with a pet for five to 15 minutes increases oxytocin (bonding hormone), serotonin (happiness hormone) and dopamine (feel-good hormone), while reducing cortisol (stress hormone) in the brain, say experts. ""People from different age groups, dealing with distress, loss, grief, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), trauma, dementia, schizophrenia and intellectual disability can benefit from animal-assisted therapy (AAT),"" says canine behaviourist Rajvi Mariwala from Mumbai. This is the reason why many schools, nursing homes, hospitals, rehabilitation centres, airports and corporate offices either prefer animal-assisted activities or AAT for those dealing with stress or requiring specific goal-oriented therapy.There are many ways in which animals can help. Since it is a non-judgmental interaction, people feel free in sharing their feelings. ""Interaction with animals is based only on energy and vibe. For example, unlike a fellow human being, dogs will not stereotype a person based on physical, psychological or other characteristics,"" shares Adnan Khan, who runs a dog therapy programme.Rajvi adds, ""For some people, it is easier to share, talk or work calmly, while focusing on the animal by petting them or even talking to them, rather than engaging with the mental health professional.""However, the therapy process can be different in different people, depending on the animal's role in therapy. ""One is the visitation animals, which are the ones you take to places like a hospital, nursing home, rehabilitation centre or school, and give others the comfort and joy for a brief amount of time by encouraging them to pet the animals and spend time with them. Then, there is AAT, in which an animal works with a professional – physical or an occupational therapist – to assist people in meeting their recovery goals. For example, a psychologist, who has therapeutic goals for a child suffering from autism, can use an animal for the therapeutic process as part of AAT,"" points out Delhi-based dog trainer Poorvaja Kumar.Various NGOs, schools and parents consult pet therapists or canine behaviourists to deal with issues of exam stress or anxiety among their students. Vandana Sharma, Principal and Director of Mata Bhagwanti Chadha Niketan (a charitable school for kids with special needs), says, ""The therapy has helped us to see positive changes in our students. They get happy to see a non-judgemental friend around them.""Lokesh Prasad, who works with the NGO Chal Chaley, adds, ""We work with underprivileged kids and the presence of a pet motivates them to learn basic things like counting through these activities and small lessons of health and hygiene. It is also a fun way to learn things for kids who are dealing with various mental issues.""""Therapy animals are basically animals who have the special role of providing comfort and help to a person dealing with a certain issue,"" says dog trainer Poorvaja. Explaining how such pets or animals are trained, Rajvi says, ""The animal needs to be assessed for suitability in terms of temperament and inclination for therapy work. Ideally, such an animal needs to be confident, calm, adaptable and friendly, as well as being non-reactive to other animals. The animal also needs to be totally healthy and clean.That has to be checked strictly. Training needs to be done exhaustively by exposing the animal to different environments and situations.""The concept of AAT is applicable to all walks of life. Adnan explains, ""It can be used in mental health counselling/psychotherapy, workplace, stadiums, airports, universities and major institutes dealing with exam stress. Most importantly, we focus largely on people with special needs, in orphanages, detention centres and prisons, the LGBTQIA+ people among others.""Experts point out benefits of AAT:- Interacting with animals can create a sense of calm and can reduce anxiety and grief- The bond you feel with animals can make people feel loved, safe and this in turn reduce a sense of isolation- It can lead to a sense of self worth- Can improves one’s communication and socialisation skills- Animals can be ideal source of distraction, thus allowing a person’s attention to be diverted away from a stressful situation- Dogs- Cats- Horses- Rabbits- Guinea Pigs/Hamsters- Birds/Reptiles/Dolphins",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74780657,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-184789/74780657.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/animal-assisted-therapy-can-help-with-stress-and-anxiety-experts/articleshow/74780476.cms

I had even bought a professional camera, but never got around to properly exploring it. Now I have finally got it out and I am clicking away. Since I can’t get anyone to teach me, I read some articles online and watched tutorials to get the basics right. The downside is that right now, I can only click within my house or from the balcony.

NEW DELHI: As most of India went into shutdown in a mega effort to stop the spread of Covid-19 — complete lockdowns were announced in 30 states/ UTs and a total of 548 districts — Delhi prepared to step up measures to keep people at home. Delhi Police will be issuing “curfew passes” to facilitate inter-border movement of persons engaged in providing essential goods.Police issued an order to this effect late on Monday evening. As of now, persons from Delhi-based essential services organisations — both private and government — can move around in the city for work by showing their official identity cards. As inter-state borders have been sealed, NCR-based private organisations engaged in providing essential services will need to obtain the passes by 12 noon, Tuesday, from the DCP’s office designated by the department. On Monday, police registered 475 cases for violation of the government order restricting movement of people. Around 100 cases for violations were also registered under section 188 IPC (disobedience of government instructions) and 326 cases under section 65 of the DP Act.The crackdown came even as more areas of India were put under lockdown on Monday as the battle against Covid-19 entered a decisive phase, with the government of Punjab and the Chandigarh administration, imposing curfew. The Pinarayi government in India’s second worst hit state Kerala – which had dithered on the Centre’s directive to impose a lockdown just 24 hours ago – also decided to follow other states on Monday by ordering complete shutdown of the state till March 31. Other states where total lockdown was imposed on Monday were Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka , Gujarat, Assam and Manipur.On Sunday, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Chandigarh, Rajasthan, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram had ordered total lockdown. According to information by the Centre, 30 state/UT governments have imposed complete lockdown in their respective territories. Severe restrictions on movement of people have been imposed in nearly 600 districts in all.

29,['24/03/2020'],India on alert as ‘China deploys dozen underwater drones in IOR’,"NEW DELHI: India is keeping a watchful eye on the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) amid reports that China has now also taken to deploying underwater drones apart from hydrographic survey and oceanic research ships in the region. The concern in the Indian security establishment is that while such surveys are undertaken for deep-sea mining and other commercial activities, they are also critical for submarine and anti-submarine warfare operations.

International business magazine Forbes on Sunday reported China had deployed adozen “Sea Wing” underwater drones from specialist research vessel Xiangyanghong 06 in the IOR in mid-December before recovering them last month. These long-range Sea Wing gliders, which can operate for months on end, made “more than 3,400 observations” for the winter survey of the “joint ocean and ecology research project” run by the Chinese ministry of natural resources.

The Forbes report said though the Chinese underwater drones were ostensibly gathering oceanographic data, transmitting information back to their mother ship via tail aerials, such data is commonly gathered for naval intelligence and submarine warfare operations. Indian Navy sources on Monday said they “could not vouch for the authenticity” of the Forbes report. But the Navy continues to “constantly track” the presence of Chinese research vessels in the IOR through “multiple platforms” ranging from the P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft to warships on mission-based deployments.

“At any given time, there are four to five Chinese research vessels mapping different parts of the IOR. They regularly collect oceanographic data about the physical operating environment like seawater temperatures, salinity and chlorophyll levels, which are very useful for general navigation and submarine operations. They work out the best routes for their submarines,” said a source.

If any such Chinese research vessel enters India’s Exclusive Economic Zone, which stretches to 200 nautical miles from its coast, and engages in any “suspicious military activity”, it is chased away after a suitable warning. Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh in December had confirmed his force drove away Chinese oceanic research vessel Shi Yan-1 after it was found indulging in suspicious activity near the strategically-located Andaman and Nicobar archipelago. “Since that incident in September, no Chinese vessel has entered our EEZ so far,” said another source.

China, of course, has been rapidly expanding its naval footprint in the IOR and is hunting for more logistical bases after establishing its first overseas base at Djibouti in the Horn of Africa and naval turnaround facilities at Karachi. Apart from deploying warships in the IOR for over a decade now, China has also been regularly sending both nuclear as well as conventional submarines to the region under the guise of anti-piracy patrols.

With two aircraft carriers (two more are being built), 33 destroyers, 54 frigates, 42 corvettes, 50 diesel-electric and 10 nuclear submarines, among other warships, the Chinese Navy is now posing a challenge to even the US Navy.

PATNA: Amid initial reports of violation of lockdown, senior officials of the state government on Monday directed the officers on field assignments to adhere to the advisories issued by the government and take legal actions against the violators.

Additional director general (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar held a meeting with the senior police officers at the police headquarters and asked all the SSPs and the SPs to implement the lockdown in letter and spirit. “I have asked the officers concerned to make people aware on the one hand and initiate legal recourse on the other, if required,” he said.

Referring to the provisions of the law, the ADG said, “Any person disobeying any regulation or order made under this Act shall be deemed to have committed an offence punishable under Section 188 of the IPC, which can lead to a jail term of six months, a fine of Rs 1,000, or both. In addition, sections 269, 270 and 271 (related to Epidemic Diseases Act 1897) can be slapped against them.”

The police headquarters has also deployed additional security personnel to implement the lockdown effectively. “The senior officers have been asked to personally see whether the lockdown was being enforced under their jurisdiction. At the same time the officers found to be lax will not be spared,” Kumar said after the review of the preventive measures to contain the novel cornovirus.

“Those found to be roaming aimlessly on the roads were penalized under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act,” Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said.

A senior IAS officer said the situation would improve from Tuesday when rail and air services would stop in true sense. “Some passengers, who reached either by trains or flights were stranded in Patna. So some relaxation was given to allow them to reach their destination today. But that will not happen from Tuesday,” he said.

IAS officers join disaster mgmt team: The state government has deputed two IAS officers – Balamurugan D and Anirudh Kumar – as special officers to the state disaster management department to assist the officers concerned in fighting coronavirus effectively.

Several ADM rank officers were deputed at PMCH, IGIMS (both in Patna), SKMCH (Muzafffarpur), DMCH (Darbhanga), Bettiah Medical College (West Champaran), ANMMCH (Gaya) and JLNMCH (Bhagalpur) to assist the district authorities.

PATNA: With nearly 3,700 passengers, two more Pune-Danapur special trains (01401/01139) reached the Danapur station on Monday. The first one arrived at 9.30am and the other at 1.30pm.

Altogether four special trains mostly carrying migrants from Maharashtra have reached here after a sudden lockdown in Mumbai and Pune due to the outbreak of coronavirus (Covid-19).

Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar claimed that the railways had made all necessary arrangements for screening a large number of passengers at a nearby school in Khagaul.

“These passengers were made to sit in separate rooms after which government and railway doctors did their medical check-up. Those, who complained of fever and cold, were immediately segregated and sent to the isolation ward of the Danapur sadar hospital by a bus for proper treatment,” he said.

The DRM also thanked the state government for extending full support to the railways. He said, “Officials of the district administration, including Danapur Sadar SDO, were present on the spot and helped conduct the check-up and screening test smoothly.”

He added, “Nearly 3,500 passengers travelled by the Lokmanya Tilak-Patna Express (13202), Lokmanya Tilak-Patliputra Junction (12141), Pune-Danapur Express (12149) and Bengaluru-Patliputra Junction Sanghamitra Express (12295) on Monday. A team of railway doctors conducted their thermal screening after they reached Buxar, Ara, Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal and Patliputra Junction. Since no positive case was reported during the check-up, they were allowed to go home.”

Besides, eight other express trains reached their respective destinations in Sonepur (3), Samastipur (4) and Dhanbad (1) divisions of the ECR on Monday. All the passengers were screened properly.

19 suspected cases discharged: Of the 24 suspected cases of Covid-19, who were kept under observation at the Danapur sadar hospital after arriving from Maharashtra on Sunday, 19 were discharged on Monday. No specific symptoms of the disease were found in them.

Hospital superintendent Dr Ashok Kumar Singh told TOI on Monday that the remaining five suspects were still under observation.

Altogether 3,990 passengers of two special trains were screened at a school near the Danapur railway station on their arrival from Maharashtra.

PATNA: The Patna Meteorological Centre (Met) will soon set up four LED automatic weather stations (AWS) at different tourist places in the state by the end of 2020. The stations are likely to come up in Patna, Bodh Gaya, Rajgir and Vaishali.

The Met office in Patna has already identified a place in Bodh Gaya and got no-objection certificate from the state government for the installation of display board.

A senior official at the Met centre told this newspaper on Monday, “The display board will come up near the entrance gate of Mahabodhi Mahavihara in Bodh Gaya. The installation of AWS has already started,” the official said, adding the station will provide real time automatic measurement of weather parameters.

According to the official, the remaining three places are yet to be identified. “We have picked tourist places because a large number of people gather there. They will be able to see daily weather bulletin as well as climatic alert,” he said.

The stations will showcase daily update of all weather parameters, including rain measurement, wind direction, wind speed, minimum and maximum temperatures, humidity, pressure and timing of sunset and sunrise.

It will also display the 48-hour weather update available on the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) online portal. Beside, weather alerts like occurrence of hailstorm, rain and lighting will also be displayed.

“An early warning will help residents, tourists and farmers know about the weather conditions in advance,” the official said.

The IMD will procure the sensor-based LED display screens, provide necessary meteorological instruments, technical maintenance and guidance for the AWS.

Each AWS costs anywhere between Rs 4 lakh and Rs 7 lakh, depending on the size of the screen. All the boards can connect to the main server at the Met office in Patna.

PATNA: Hit by reports of Covid-19 positive cases in Bihar, many city residents and housing societies have decided to ask their domestic workers, including cooks, maids and drivers, not to come to work for their mutual safety.

Samanpura resident Shabana Imam asked her domestic help to stay at home till the situation improves. “Though the lock down was announced from Monday, I gave leave to my help from Saturday because we were hearing the news about the spread of Covid-19 across the country. Since my help comes by autorickshaw, it was not safe for her to use public transport as well as for my family because she will ultimately come in contact with us. I have also given her some salary because I do not know when she will be able to come next time.”

Shabana added that she was involving her kids in the daily chores as their school and colleges are shut.

Anita Ranjan, a resident of Aneesabad in the city, has asked her help not to come for a fortnight and assured her that there will be no deduction from her monthly wages. “I asked my domestic help not to come to ensure social distancing and prevent the spread of Covid-19 virus. The virus is highly contagious and we don’t know where all she has gone and whom she is interacting with. Thus, we have asked her not to come for the time being, but I have told her that she will get her full monthly wages,” she said.

However, Gayatri Devi, who works a few houses in Ashiana Nagar area to make ends meet, has not yet been told by any of her employers to stop coming to work. “I work in eight houses, but nobody has asked me so far for not to come to work. Most people keep sanitisers and I clean my hand using it before entering the house,” she said.

Many residents said they are not stopping their domestic help from coming as they live nearby. “I haven’t stopped my help as she stays next to my house and goes to only a couple of houses. Besides, since everyone is staying at home, the workload is more for which I need her help,” a Kankerbagh-based homemaker said, wishing anonymity.

Seema Sinha, a resident of Saguna Mor said she has given emergency leave to her driver to go to his native place in Bhojpur. “I told him that I would not deduct his salary under the present circumstances. Besides, we are not traveling long distances as schools and offices are closed. However, my maid is working on alternate days as a precautionary measure,” she said.

Health officials of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) said the three staffers- a 26-year-old male, a 35-year-old male and a 36-year-old- of the private hospital have tested negative for coronavirus. They said test reports of the other six suspected patients of coronavirus also kept in the NCH’s isolation ward were awaited.

The others included a 59-year-old male from Parle Point, who had travelled to Haridwar, a 40-year-old woman from Bhatar with no travel history and a 22-year-old male from Lambe Hanuman Road with no travel history.

A day after the janata curfew, people came out in large numbers in some parts of the city to purchase vegetables and groceries amid announcement of extension of lockdown until March 31 to check spread of the deadly virus. Municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani and police commisioner R B Brahmbhatt were out on the streets to ask people to stay indoors for their own benefit.

“We appeal to the residents to stay at home. They should get out of their houses to purchase vegetables and groceries between 12pm and 4pm only,” Banchhanidhi Pani said.

""On Monday, a person who has been home quarantined in Mota Varachha area violated the mandatory rule and hence an FIR has been lodged against him. A total of 44 people were fined for spitting in public and Rs22,000 fine collected from them. Till now, a total of 1,343 people have been penalized for spitting in public places and fine of Rs6.71 lakh collected from the violators. SMC has carried out disinfectant activities at 885 places in the city,'' Pani added.

37,['24/03/2020'],SBI takes cluster approach for branch ops,"Kolkata: The State Bank of India ( SBI ) has resorted to a cluster approach for keeping its bank branch operations open during the Covid-19 lockdown days in the state. The largest lender in the country has created a module for this.

As per the module, the biggest branch in an area would remain open while relatively smaller branches would be linked to that. In Kolkata and surrounding areas, as many as 39 branches would be operational.

The former deputy chief secretary of SBI Staff Association, Ashok Mukherjee, pointed out that the employees of all the linked branches can man the branch which would be operational in rotation.

Some of the SBI branches that would remain open include Dhakuria, Bhowanipore, Park Circus, Elgin Road, Picnic Garden, Shyambazar, Paikpara, Hatibagan, Sealdah, Salt Lake AE Market, Narkeldanga, Lake Town, Rajarhat-New Town along with others.

“This is the best solution one can have considering the problems all are facing. It was becoming almost impossible for all the employees to come to branches everyday considering the lock down,” he added.

Meanwhile, in the wake of the spread of Corona virus in the country, the United Bank of India ( UBI ) has waived off all card transaction charges at ATMs and POS (point of sales) till March 31.

Ashok K Pradhan, MD & CEO, UBI, said that as services/timings through branches will be limited during this period, this move is taken to facilitate customers who may fulfil their cash needs from any bank ATMs by using their debit cards, wherein they do not have to incur any extra charges.

KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation and the apartment owners’ association of the Ballygunge apartment where four persons, including the domestic help, of a family were found Covid-19 positive, launched a disinfection and fumigation drive at the domestic help quarters and the common area on Monday. They will also send all the domestic help, who have been asked to stay in isolation, for a Covid-19 test at Beleghata ID Hospital on Tuesday.

The condominium in south Kolkata is home to a 22-year-old who was the city’s second confirmed victim of Covid-19 who tested positive on Friday morning. On Sunday, his parents and a domestic help were diagnosed with the same disease, throwing the residents in panic, even though they issued lockdown strictures from Friday itself and took themselves into home isolation.

“What’s worrying is the fact that the domestic help used to stay at the quarters on the first floor and we have no clue with how many other people he had interacted. If some other domestic help gets in touch with him and then goes to work in another apartment, both he and his employers will be at risk. We have asked each member of our apartment, including the other domestic helps, to remain cautious and report if they come across any symptom of the disease,” said a member of the apartment owners’ association.

“We wanted a detailed test for all the domestic helps living in the apartment on Monday, but the health department said they would check them on Tuesday. Since none of them have any symptoms of the disease as yet, they have been advised to stay in home isolation for the time being,” said a member of the association.

Debasis Kumar, the member, mayor-in-council (parks and gardens), who is a resident of the same complex said the KMC sent a team of health workers on Monday to deep clean and disinfect the complex. “We have sprayed bleaching powder and chlorine throughout the common area and have disinfected the entire complex — including elevators, staircases and lobby. The process will be repeated at regular intervals,” he said.

The residents of the complex themselves had taken some proactive safety measures, including fumigating the elevators, from Friday. “We have been doing everything possible on our part to stay in home isolation. But there are some senior government officials in our complex who are flouting the norm and are criticizing our lockdown protocol,” a resident said.

39,['24/03/2020'],Indian expats won’t pay tax here on overseas income,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Indian citizens who are working overseas (including the large Indian diaspora working in low or nil tax Gulf region) can finally breathe a sigh of relief. The Finance Bill, as passed by Parliament today, was suitably amended to ensure that overseas income will not be subject to tax in India, under the newly introduced deemed residency norms.

Under the Income Tax (I-T) Act, a tax resident of India, who is also an ordinarily resident, has to pay tax on his global income. All other individuals pay tax only on their India source income, such as interest on fixed deposits, rent from immovable property in India, to name a few. The Bill, as tabled in the Parliament on February 1, had introduced the concept of a ‘deemed resident’ for Indian citizens.

An Indian citizen , who is not liable to tax in any other country, by reason of his domicile, residence or any other criteria of similar nature would be a deemed resident for tax purposes, it had stated. TOI had correctly analysed in its Budget edition of February 2 that the Bill did not intend to tax Indian citizens who are bonafide workers in other countries on their overseas income.

Subsequently, CBDT had stated that, “In case of an Indian citizen who becomes deemed resident of India under this proposed provision, income earned outside India by him shall not be taxed in India, unless it is derived from an Indian business or profession.”

Gautam Nayak, tax partner, CNK Associations, said, “The amendment ensures that an individual who is an Indian citizen, would be regarded as a deemed tax resident of India, only if his total income from Indian sources (including a foreign business controlled in India or profession set up in India) exceeds Rs 15 lakh. Such a person would be treated as a not-ordinarily resident and will be liable to tax in India only on his India-source income and not his global income.

“India source income is always taxable in India. Thus, in regular cases, this may not impact the tax position in India. However, concessional rate of tax for non-residents under the I-T Act, on dividend income of 20% (as opposed to applicable slab rate) may not be available. If the individual is covered by a tax treaty, the appliable rate would apply. To illustrate, UAE residents would be subject to a 10% tax on dividends earned from Indian companies,” explains Puneet Gupta, director, People Advisory Services at EY-India. “Further, by imposing a threshold of Rs 15 lakh, this amendment will ensure that Non-resident Indians (NRIs) with negligible income in India, would not be impacted,” adds Nayak.

Under the I-T Act, Indian citizens and persons of Indian origin ( PIO ) who were on a visit to India, are treated as a resident, only if they had been in India for an overall period of 365 days or more during the four previous years and had been in India for 182 days in that particular financial year.

While the Financethe Bill had proposed to reduce the period of 182 days to 120 days in all cases, the amendment restricts the applicability of 120 days only where the Indian citizen or PIO have India source income exceeding Rs 15 lakh. “Such individuals will be treated as resident but not ordinarily resident and will pay tax only on their Indian source income,” explains Gupta.

41,['24/03/2020'],Easing loan repayment norms inevitable: Aditya Puri,"MUMBAI: HDFC Bank chief Aditya Puri said that authorities had no choice but to allow forbearance on loans and to provide a fiscal stimulus given the current situation.The chief of the country’s largest bank said the lockdown should be extended by 14 days to “flatten the curve” in respect of the spread of the coronavirus . He also called for amending the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act to increase capacity in terms of testing, quarantining and providing ventilators to be able to control the pandemic.“My view is that the fiscal deficit is not important. When the government took over, the fiscal deficit was 5.8% and there was no crisis at that time. Rather than worrying about the deficit, the worry should be about health issues and well-being and do whatever is rational in terms of forbearance,” said Puri. He added that the government also needs to pull all stops to alleviate the issues with daily wage workers.“Obviously the lockdown will create cashflow issues and we will be happy to step in as we are sitting on $5 billion of excess liquidity,” said Puri. According to Puri, while the bank is willing to lend to businesses that have cash flow issues, the borrowers will have to demonstrate that they will generate the cash flows to repay the loans in the future.Currently, any borrower who does not repay on time risks being classified as a defaulter and denied future bank credit. Only the RBI has powers to grant a forbearance on the loans being classified as default. Puri said that in the current environment, forbearance has to be across categories.He indicated that HDFC Bank was unlikely to come out with a loan facility like that of SBI , which provided additional credit to small businesses at a concessional rate with a six-month moratorium on repayments, as unlike SBI, HDFC Bank did not have government support.Responding to a research report by Bernstein that criticised the bank for not identifying a successor yet, Puri said the bank had groomed executives who could be candidates to succeed him when he retires in October this year. “We also somewhere along the line said, ‘Why don’t let’s also look outside, maybe we get an exceptional candidate’. Though we had very strong internal candidates. All that has been done. The recommendations are with the search committee, and before April, the appropriate person who will take the bank into the future will be announced,” said Puri.On his expectations on when demand would return, Puri said China and South Korea have been able to come back to some semblance of normalcy with a one-month lockdown. He said that given the fundamental demand in the economy and the advantage of lower oil prices and commodity prices, the economy could continue to grow between 4-5% depending on how soon the situation sorts out.Responding to concerns on the bank’s unsecured loans, Puri said the total unsecured portfolio of the bank is 16% of which 6% was cards and the rest were personal loans. “Out of the personal loan portfolio, 75% of the loans are to salaried employees of A-rated companies and there is no reason for us to worry about that portfolio,” he said. On the bank’s NBFC arm, HDB Financial Services’ asset quality in the Bernstein report, Puri said this was the only finance company that followed the stricter norms for bad loans that applied to banks.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74788613,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-61679,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/easing-loan-repayment-norms-inevitable-puri/articleshow/74783471.cms

VIJAYAWADA: The lockdown announced by the state government due to the coronavirus outbreak elicited mixed response in the city. Thousands of vehicles and public roamed freely on the streets, and commercial establishments continued to do business thumbing their nose to the orders. It was a drastic departure for a city, which extended unprecedented support to the janata curfew on Sunday.

Considering the growing number of positive cases of novel coronavirus, the Union government directed the AP government to lock down Krishna district. The development came in the wake of one positive case being registered in the city few days ago. As all neighbouring states have already gone into lockdown mode and stalled all the public transport facilities, chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy on Sunday declared a complete lockdown of the state, barring emergency services, till March 31.

Shops selling essential commodities are exempt from the lockdown, which citizens took advantage of and took to the streets. All major vegetable markets in the city were overcrowded on Monday, breaking social distancing norms that are to be followed currently. About 30%-40% of the city’s vehicles were on the road as well. Police were forced to switch on traffic signals at Gurunanak Road, NTR Health University , and Benz circle to control the traffic.

Krishna district administration, on receiving the reports from ground level teams and ward secretaries, directed the police to erect barricades on the main roads to regulate traffic. Collector A Mohammed Imtiaz said that a lockdown was meant to isolate the public and reduce the risk of transmission of coronavirus. He said that stringent action would be initiated against those who roamed the streets.

Police displayed placards and urged citizens to not come out. They warned a few pan shops, fancy shops, and mobile repair centres which had continued operating secretly through back doors.

The police urged the public from specially arranged public address systems to support the lockdown call given by the government.

Rupnagar in Punjab and Chandigarh were at number three spot with AQI value of 41, whereas Udaipur in Rajasthan stood fourth in the list with AQI of 42.The data of the last few days revealed that AQI for Ludhiana had started to fall since last Saturday (105). On Sunday, AQI was 70.Last year on the same date, the AQI value for the city was 58 which comes under ‘satisfactory category’ with possible health impacts as ‘minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people’.With the pollution level going down, the green activists are happy with the change. “Normally, we have heard about the city for all wrong reasons on the pollution front, but this is a pleasant change. We are happy that residents had got almost pure air to breathe which will improve their respiratory health, especially during this crucial time. Hope the authorities will study such huge fall in pollution and the reasons which can be used to minimize pollution levels in the city in the future,” said Ravi Kumar, a green activist.Local PPCB officials said it is good news but they will be happier if it was under normal circumstances and not under lockdown and curfew.“It is perhaps because of industrial shutdown, no vehicular traffic etc. However, PPCB will be happy if this kind of AQI stays round the year.

MACHHIWARA AND SAMRALA (LUDHIANA): Imposition of lockdown and curfew in view of coronavirus scare failed to stop several eateries, shops and vends from putting life of people at stake in several parts of Ludhiana.

While several eateries misused the exemption given under the lockdown and served customers on their premises in violation of the norms, several other shops and vends Machhiwara, Samrala and Doraha areas did not shut their units when the curfew was imposed at 2pm.

A large number of people had lunch at an eatery on the road between Samrala and Machhiwara. At another nearby eatery, two persons had lunch on a cot. In the same market, a vehicle workshop was also open.

In the Machhiwara town, most of the shops were closed and the township wore a deserted look.

Gurdeep Singh, a local resident, said people from villages had come to the town on Monday morning to buy eatables. He said afterwards, there was not much activity in the town.

On Neelon-Doraha road, a liquor vend was open even after the curfew was imposed by the district administration.

During curfew, many people were also seen driving in Khanna, Machhiwara, Samrala, Jagraon and Raikot areas.

Samrala SDM Geetika Singh , under whose jurisdiction Machhiwara and Samrala come, said that she would check whether the eateries were serving food to people on the premises or not. She said during curfew, people are not allowed to go out and can do so only during relaxation hours.

45,['24/03/2020'],Patna Lockdown: Patna residents rush to shops on first day of lockdown,"Several stores restricted the entry of many people at a time as a precautionary measure.

PATNA: As groceries, pharmacies and vegetable shops are allowed to open, residents thronged marketplaces on the first day of the lockdown on Monday to stock up on essential items out of fear of shortage of foodgrains, edible items and medicines.

People were seen busy buying basic edible items like sugar, salt, rice, flour, pulses, dairy products and packed food items, including noodles and pasta. For personal and home care, sanitizers, Dettol solutions, floor cleaners and drinks to increase immunity were in high demand.

Diabetic and people having other health conditions like hypertension bought medicines in bulk, forcing some of the medicine stores to put notices, restricting the number of medicines per person.

Manoj Kumar, a salesman of a drug retail shop at Govind Mitra Road, said it may be difficult for everyone but they are trying to assure the consumers that their shop would remain open even during the lockdown period. “There are enough stock of medicines in the godown as well as in our shop,” he claimed.

Few medical stores put up notices that people are not allowed to buy medicines for not more than two weeks. Shahzad Hussain, owner of a medical store near Patna Medical College and Hospital, said several people are buying medicines in bulk, claiming that the lockdown would continue for some time and essential items will go out of stock. “We have told them that all the essential items, including medicines, are exempted from the lockdown,” he said.

Similar was the situation at super markets and grocery shops. The essential items were flying off the shelves while the employees were busy restocking the items.

Kamal Kant, sales executive at a grocery shop near Budh Marg, said they are struggling to keep the shelves stocked with high-demand emergency items. “People mainly buying the packaged food, basic foodgrains, spices and personal hygiene products like sanitizer and chemicals to clean home,” he said.

Riddhi Sinha of Alpana market locality said there was a general atmosphere of panic that was hard to avoid. She also bought essential items in bulk from nearby grocery store.

Shazia Anwer of Phulwarisharif said she bought things in bulk so that she could avoid going out every few days for essential items.

Several stores restricted the entry of many people at a time as a precautionary measure.

Birendra Singh, the owner of a general store on Boring Canal Road, said only seven people are allowed to enter his shop after using hand sanitizer. “We can’t allow many people at one time and assure them that the store would remain open even in emergency situations,” he said.

Meanwhile, the vegetable vendors have hiked the prices following the rumours of closure of sabzi mandi. The vegetable prices have surged by at least 20-40%.

Munna at Anta Ghat said almost all the sellers increased the prices of vegetables. “Potato is selling at Rs35/kg, which was earlier available at Rs16/kg. Tomatoes are being sold at Rs42/kg compared to Rs25/kg a day before,” he said.

Cauliflower is being sold at Rs60/kg, lady finger at Rs45 and cabbage at Rs35/kg. Other vegetables like brinjal, capsicum, onion, carrot and bell pepper also witnessed steep rise in their prices.

PATNA: People in most districts of the state defied lockdown imposed by the state government to curb spread of coronavirus on the first day on Monday.

The lockdown remained a failure in the first half of the day in Patna as most people came out of their houses like any usual day. They thronged vegetable markets, groceries and medical stores, which were exempted from lockdown purview. Many youngsters were seen riding two-wheelers without any specific purpose.

Cops were seen deployed at all major road crossings, but they were seldom stopping commuters till noon. “The government had announced the lockdown only last night and people have come out to buy necessities. We are keeping a strict vigil on every vehicle,” a constable at Boring Road crossing said.

Many autorickshaws were seen running till afternoon and some private interdistrict buses were also seen jam-packed with passengers in the morning.

Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal later instructed the administration to seize all autorickshaws and buses which were flouting the norms. More than 50 autorickshaws were seized in the city.

Agarwal, who is also the transport secretary, said all bus stands across the state were locked down.

In Madhubani, the lockdown was by and large effective. With empty railway platforms, bus stands and roads, all modes of transport, including autorickshaws, were off the roads. Entry points of the city were barricaded to check movement of people. Police and other government vehicles were seen moving in the town, asking people to remain indoors.

However, the lockdown was not much effective in Nawada. Cops had a tough time controlling traffic. Vegetable vendors, with the intent of making an extra buck, jacked up the prices of various vegetables. Dr Shatrughan Singh, a private physician of Nawada town, said nurses were questioned by cops and asked to go back.

In Begusarai, people blatantly violated the lockdown. Youngsters were seen moving in the town till the forenoon. In the morning, even tractors carrying construction materials were seen plying on the roads. Almost all streets of the town had e-rickshaws, motorcycles and four wheelers moving. Panic buying of essential commodities was also seen in the town. Police swung into action later in the day and petty shop owners not dealing in essential commodities were shut.

In Samastipur, the lockdown evoked a good response. Few people came out on the streets but the market remained closed throughout the day. The railway station remained deserted. An anti-CAA dharna site had just five people due to the lockdown.

Heavy rush was seen in the vegetable and fruit markets in Gaya. Reports of panic buying of essential items were received from several areas of the district. The Gaya police warned violators of punitive action, including registration of criminal cases against them and imposition of fine. Gaya SSP Rajiv Mishra led a campaign for the effective implementation of the lockdown.

Residents of Biharsharif and Sheikhpura sadar showed least concern of the spread of coronavirus as they remained in markets in groups for hours. A police team led by Nalanda DM Yogendra Kumar Singh and SP Nilesh Kumar later took out a flag march which passed through the main thoroughfares of Biharsharif for creating awareness among the people.

In Madhepura, people were seen moving frequently and gathering on the roads, especially at Gudri market. Many youths were also seen enjoying joyride on the roads.

The lockdown evoked complete response in Khagaria district. All shops and business establishments, except groceries, vegetable markets, dairy booths, petrol pumps, hospitals, medical stores, LPG agencies, ration shops, ATM kiosks and banks, remained closed. Khagaria SP Meenu Kumari marched through the main thoroughfares of the town for creating awareness among the people.

In West Champaran, the lockdown was effective as all shops and business establishments downed their shutters. Rickshaws and buses were off the roads, while few private vehicles and motor bikes were seen plying on the roads.

PATNA: Over 70 people have so far been identified, who came in direct contact with three positive Covid-19 cases in Bihar so far. The one from Munger died on Saturday. Sources said they are either family members or friends who were in direct contact with infected persons.

As per a press release issued by state health society, no positive case was reported in Bihar on Monday. Of the total 185 samples collected so far, three tested positive and 127 negative. Reports of 53 samples were still awaited and two got destroyed.

The three Covid-19 cases were reported on Sunday. The Munger native had returned from Qatar and died at AIIMS-Patna. Other two positive cases are from the state capital and admitted in isolation ward of AIIMS-Patna and Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH).

Munger civil surgeon Dr K Purushottam said so far they had identified 62 people who had come in contact with the deceased. “The process of tracing others is still going on. Twenty of his relatives have been quarantined and their samples have been collected. We are requesting others, including all those who participated in his last rituals to come forward and give their samples,” Dr Purushottam said, adding, “A special team of doctors and nursing staff had been called from Bhagalpur hospital. After collecting all the samples, they will leave for Patna on Tuesday.”

He said a newly built school building where they gave their samples has been earmarked for quarantining.

A health department official said apart from relatives of the deceased, the samples of nursing staff who had attended him in Patna, had also been sent for the test. “This person had visited three hospitals in Munger, too, before coming to Patna. All those hospitals and doctors are being contacted,” he said.

State nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Ragini Mishra, said eight relatives of a person in isolation ward of AIIMS-Patna and other three relatives of another person in NMCH have been kept in isolation and their samples have been sent. “We are also tracing all those people who came in contact with infected persons,” said Dr Ragini.

Regarding the one who returned from Scotland and admitted to NMCH, the health official said he had followed all the precautionary measures and avoided meeting people. “He himself isolated and was wearing a mask. He had not met many people. His three relatives have been identified and their samples have been sent to testing,” he said.

KOLKATA: The death of Bengal’s first Covid-19 patient, a 57-year-old south Dum Dum resident, on Monday prompted the municipality to fumigate his house, as well as the local doctor’s chamber which he visited after complaining of cough and cold. A sense of fear has gripped the neighbourhood with various local housing complexes closing their gates for all outsiders.

Local councillor Keya Das said, “We have fumigated the area around the victim’s house. His family and others who had come in contact with him have been kept in isolation. Even the health centre where the victim was treated was sanitized.”

A local said there is palpable tension in the neighbourhood after the news broke on Monday afternoon. “We knew he was critical, but the news of death came as a shocker. The implications of someone who stayed close dying of Covid-19 is very scary. What’s worse is the fear that he may have unknowingly come in contact with many others,” a neighbour said.

“We have identified the rickshawpuller who took him to hospital, but we have been unable to trace the vegetable vendor and the maid. We assume that both live in thickly populated slums and that poses a greater risk in terms of community transmission,” said Kallol Datta, the victim’s acquaintance.

“His next-door neighbours, an elderly couple, had come to visit him. They are more vulnerable due to their age. We have asked them to stay in home quarantine,” said Arijit Deb, a neighbour. On Sunday night, locals procured necessary medicine for the couple and left them at their doorstep. “The aftermath of the lockdown needs to be handled at the micro level by community-specific organizations, like clubs,” he said.

Tracing who else has come in touch with the family in the past couple of days has become the biggest challenge for locals. “So far, we have found 11 persons who have come in contact with them,” the councillor said.

Das said another person who complained of sickness after returning from abroad was admitted to Beliaghata ID Hospital. She said the complex where this youth stayed has been shut since Sunday evening and they are not allowing any outsiders. “Several housing complexes in the area have gone for complete shutdown. I checked their arrangement on Monday and found it to be satisfactory,” she added.

Renu Das who stays in Nilambar Vihar near Nagerbazar, said they were not allowing any outsiders into the complex. South Dum Dum Municipality councillor Amit Poddar said, “In one complex, we organized the check-up of some people who returned from UK. Fortunately, they tested negative.”

KOLKATA: Residents’ associations of almost all prominent housing complexes in the city have formed special vigilance groups to keep tabs on those who have recently returned from abroad to ensure they stay in home isolation.

On Monday afternoon, residents of one such complex off EM Bypass called the health department about a family that returned from the US last week but had not been following the home quarantine protocol. Officials then took the family of three, including a doctor, to the quarantine centre in New Town for tests. Incidentally, this doctor was earlier criticized for visiting a Basirhat nursing home and conducting multiple surgeries there. The state had shut down the nursing home and asked the doctor and his family to stay in home quarantine. “The family, however, had been roaming around the complex in spite of repeated requests to stay at home. On Monday, the doctor’s wife came down to receive a food delivery after a security guard stopped him at the gate. The woman said she would lodge a complaint of harassment. That is when we called the health department,” said a member of the residents’ association.

At another housing complex near Chingrighata, the association has asked the family of a youth — who was admitted at a state hospital but tested negative for Covid-19 — to stay at home while the association leaves their daily essentials outside their apartment. “The family is very sensible. Since the youth had himself gone for the test, they have not come out of their home even once. We had been sending home-cooked food for the youth at the hospital till Monday and were shopping for the daily essentials to leave them outside their homes,”said an association member.

The police have said they have received inputs from certain high-rises and condos about people returning to Kolkata from foreign shores in the past four days. “A condo on Biren Roy Road and another in Kasba have submitted a list of all outstation trips undertaken by their residents. They have even pointed out who among them have quarantined themselves on their return and who have not,” said an official.

Officers said they have met members of these gated communities and health officials whenever there was a call. “The health department officials showed them how to sanitize the common passage and elevators. Many of them have recorded videos and sent their feedback,” said an officer.

At an apartment off Dhakuria Bridge, where several elderly residents stay, every one has been asked to disclose if they have come in touch with anyone returning from abroad. “After collection of data, we send it to the local police station and seek directions from the health department,” said the president of the association.

In a complex on James Long Sarani, the residents first offered to bring the essentials to a couple who had returned from the US so the duo could remain in quarantine. “The residents said they involved the Haridevpur police only after the couple violated the agreement,” an officer said.

PATNA: Even as the announcement came on Monday halting domestic flight operations from March 24 midnight at all airports in the country, the Patna airport continued to see heavy rush as trains and long-distance buses have already stopped operating due to the lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 virus.

According to the civil aviation ministry order, all airlines will have to plan their operations to ensure that the last flight lands before 11.59pm on Tuesday. The restrictions, however, will not apply to cargo flights.

CM Nitish Kumar had on Sunday appealed to the Centre to suspend the Patna-bound flights till March 31.

Flyers who landed in Patna on Monday faced a tough time trying to reach their destination due to the state government-mandated curbs on public transport in view of the first to Covid-19 death reported in the state on Sunday.

Several passengers said they had to pay exorbitant prices, often more than three times the average fare, to book pre-paid autos at Patna airport. Others were forced to walk carrying their luggage to get e-rickshaws.

Mayank Jha, an entrepreneur based in Delhi, paid Rs 550 to reach Rajiv Nagar. “There were only a few auto-rickshaws and all of them were charging very high rates. I usually pay Rs 200 to Rs 240 from Patna airport to Rajiv Nagar. I was forced to pay Rs 550, since there was no other public transport available,” he said.

Visheshwar Singh travelled all the way from Darbhanga in north Bihar to Patna on Monday morning to pick up his son from the airport due to the lockdown. “It took me three hours to reach the airport from Darbhanga. My son studies in a school in Hyderabad and he returned today. Though I had to come all the way here, but I am fine with it as the lockdown is for the safety of all of us,” Singh said.

Rishabh Kumar, who works in a private firm in Hyderabad, was also seen waiting at Patna airport for his father, who was coming from Mirganj in Gopalganj district, which is more than four hours from Patna.

Domestic flights coming from cities like Delhi, Kolkata, Lucknow, Ranchi and Hyderabad were near packed and the spot fares skyrocketed as a result of the demand.

Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal told this newspaper on Monday that a few BSRTC buses will run from the airport on Tuesday for flyers within the city. “The airport express bus service will remain suspended from Wednesday as domestic flight operations will not operate as per the directives from the Centre,” he said.

GAYA: As the number of coronavirus suspects grew in the district, OPD services have been suspended and in emergency situations, those needing immediate medical assistance have been advised to dial the dedicated number released by the district administration. Four teams have been formed to identify Covid-19 suspects and those with questionable travel history.

According to DM Abhishek Singh, the practice of media briefing is being discontinued and mediapersons would be provided updates digitally.

Confirming the admission of suspects, the DM said those showing symptoms of the deadly virus have been kept in the isolation ward and those with a travel history have been put in the quarantine centres established for the purpose. More quarantine centres will be established, said the DM.

According to Dr NK Paswan, nodal officer of the anti-corona operations, samples collected from the isolation ward inmates are being sent for lab testing. Asked about the two air passengers from Thailand, Dr Paswan said their test reports were awaited and follow-up action would be taken after that.

PATNA: The results of Matriculation and Intermediate exams conducted by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) are likely to be delayed as the evaluation work has been suspended till March 31 in view of the Covid-19 lockdown.

Kishor told this newspaper on Monday that evaluation of the answer copies of Inter students was almost complete.

“In the next couple of days, we will decide the date of declaration of Intermediate results. As far as the evaluation of Matriculation papers is concerned, almost 75% of them have been evaluated,” he said and added that the BSEB would try to complete the evaluation process before time.

55,['24/03/2020'],Rupee hits 76.29 amid calls to freeze mkts,"Mayur Shetty | TNNMumbai: The rupee hit a new low of 76.29 against the dollar as equity markets went into a free fall on the back of relentless sale by foreign institutional investors. The RBI intervened heavily by selling dollars to stem the fall.The central bank also advanced its bond-buyback plan and announced a fresh repo auction of Rs 1 lakh crore to replace some of the rupee funds it drained by selling dollars. The domestic currency opened at 75.90 and soon breached the 76 levels, triggering intervention by the RBI, which helped it regain the 75 levels briefly. But without any dollar sellers in the market, the rupee slipped to close at a new low. With both equities and the rupee in a free fall, there were calls to freeze the financial markets.The Indian Banks Association has also asked the RBI to allow borrowers an additional 90 days to regularise their loan accounts in addition to the 90 days allowed under the law. It has also asked for a reduction in the cash reserve ratio requirement for banks and more time to pursue the resolution of defaults outside bankruptcy.“No one can forecast how low can the rupee go. What we know is that things can get worse on the coronavirus front. Given that controlling the pandemic will require a lockdown, it would help to put a moratorium on the asset side of banks and allow only cash dispensation,” said Ashhish Vaidya, country treasurer, DBS Bank.“The cost of a 30-day moratorium can be compensated by the government. These are extraordinary times and extraordinary measures need to be taken to ensure that businesses remain solvent,” he added.Speaking to TOI, a former central banker said that none of the conventional monetary policy measures would work on their own and the central bank would need to take innovative measures such as a standstill on all payment obligations as long as economic activity remains frozen. At the same time, government officials could exercise powers to spend at the grassroots level, he said. This was necessary to ensure that businesses remained solvent.HDFC Bank chief, addressing the media, said that there was no option but to allow a forbearance on repayments. “It is one-way traffic. The regulators could look at closing the financial markets up to the end of March. Given the catastrophic situation, banks could be given more time for extending their closing of accounts. As far as customers are concerned, banks can stuff the ATMs with currency. In any case, there is a bank holiday on March 25,” said K N Dey of United Financial Consultants, a firm which advises businesses on foreign exchange. He said that in the current market, there are no sellers as exporters are hit with a double whammy with their orders being cancelled and then having to cancel the forward contracts.The RBI, meanwhile, announced that it would offer banks Rs 1 lakh crore through repo operations in two equal tranches on March 23 and March 24. “The Reserve Bank is monitoring the evolving financial market conditions. The Reserve Bank will calibrate its operations to meet any need for additional liquidity support, if warranted, to ensure normal functioning of markets, promote staff welfare and preserve financial stability,” RBI said. It also advanced the date of its Rs 30,000-crore open market operations.“The question that investors need to answer: ‘Will Covid-19 redefine societies and economic models and inflict prolonged and massive damage; or will it simply nudge us towards different policies like basic income guarantees and modern monetary theory (MMT) but still leave the essence of our societies intact, and the impact while deep, will not cause an economic reset?’ Our answer remains latter rather than former,” said Suresh Ganapathy, research analyst with Macquarie Capital Securities.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74783361,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-67879,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rupee-hits-76-29-amid-calls-to-freeze-mkts/articleshow/74783363.cms
56,['24/03/2020'],SP sends default report against cop for framing lawyer,"Aurangabad: Carrying out an internal probe into the allegations of framing a lawyer and three of his acquaintance in a false case, Beed superintendent of police Harssh Poddar has sent a default report against the inspector of Beed city police station to the Aurangabad range special inspector general of police Ravinder Kumar Singal.

Authorities said the inquiry has found that the inspector has erred. The IGP would either initiate a preliminary inquiry followed by a departmental inquiry before initiating action, or directly initiate action against the officer concerned.

When contacted, SP Poddar said: “As per the enquiry carried out by additional superintendent of police, it has come to fore that Beed city police station’s police inspector took the accused into custody without complete verification.”

After the arrested lawyer’s family came up with CCTV footage supporting their claim that the lawyer was somewhere else at the time of incident, SP Poddar had removed the investigation officer and appointed Gevrai sub-divisional police officer Swapnil Rathod as the investigation officer in the case.

Ratnadeep Tathe, a 22-year old complaint and an ITI student, had lodged a complaint stating that four identified and two unidentified suspects waylaid him and his friend on the afternoon of March 1 while they were passing through the Savta Mali chowk, and sought Rs 25, 000. After he expressed his inability to give them the cash, the six suspects allegedly hurled caste-based abuses and even attacked him with a sword. The complainant claimed of being threatened with a firearm as well.

On receiving the complaint, the Beed city police summoned those named in the complaint. However, despite them saying that they were not present at the spot, as being claimed by the complainant, the police registered the offence in the early hours of March 2 and arrested them immediately under relevant sections of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and Indian Arms Act, 1959. In addition, they were also slapped with charges of rioting, unlawful assembly and criminal intimidation.

Those arrested in the case have been identified as lawyer Yogesh Gavhane and three of his relatives Nitin, Sriram and Ashok. After being produced before the court on March 2, they were remanded in 3-day police custody. Only after the senior officers started inquiring into the matter, the investigation officer, on completion of the PCR sought judicial custody of the arrested men and failed to show any recovery in the case.

With the Beed sessions court rejecting their bail plea, the arrested lawyer and his kin moved the high court seeking bail.

On the ground across the country, police personnel stopped their delivery executives and shut down warehouses as operations came to a halt.Amazon India and Flipkart are delaying shipments of non-essential goods to focus on food and grocery, but also face the challenge of a shutdown of state borders to move goods across the country. “There are two issues, — without interstate movement it’s impossible to deliver orders. And second, the definition of essential items needs to be simple and uniform for everyone, so we don’t face different issues in different states,” a person briefed on the matter said.As the lockdown across major cities gets tighter, essential services like daily grocery and fresh vegetables through Amazon Pantry, Amazon Fresh, were not operating throughout Monday and Ekart (Flipkart’s logistics arm) warehouse was forced to shut in Delhi last night, owing to lack of clarity among officials and police on the ground. This even led to two delivery and supply chain executives getting arrested on Sunday, two people aware of the matter said.Online food-delivery players like Swiggy also have some of the cloud kitchens, which only do deliveries and don’t have a seating area, operating in their network being asked to shut down besides harassment of delivery personnel across the country. Platforms like Udaan cater to about 20% of the consumption in cities like Bengaluru through kiranas and small stores, including the supply of groceries and vegetables.These sources said representatives of online delivery companies had a meeting with the ministry of consumer affairs on Monday where they stressed on the need to allow the interstate movement of grocery items, vegetables, and other daily essentials. Another person said the government is clear about the ease e-commerce platforms can bring but it needs to make sure the message to officials on the ground is clear.“So, they don’t create unnecessary issues, in the first mile or last mile,” he added. On Friday, the ministry of consumer affairs had urged all state and local governments to exempt e-commerce operations, including their warehousing and logistics facilities and services, from any type of prohibitory orders amid the coronavirus outbreak so that there is no shortage of essential items for consumers.Meanwhile, Amazon India said it is making changes in its policies across logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing, and seller processes. “This includes prioritising stocking and delivering priority items like household staples, health and hygiene products, sanitisers, baby formula, and medical supplies. We will inform customers about changes to our services as the situation continues to evolve,” a company spokesperson said.Several merchants selling non-essential items also found their products being put on hold and not displayed on the platform. To be sure, it would be a challenge for online platforms to deliver necessary items on time if the government exceptions are not implemented properly.“There are operational issues on the ground which impact our ability to seamlessly service the communities as they stay indoors. We are working with the Centre and state governments as an industry to solve these challenges,” a Flipkart spokesperson added.According to communication to sellers by both the companies, reviewed by TOI, e-commerce companies had to implement several restrictions like the delay of shipping by two days, large delivery hubs being closed, and many seller services being put on hold. For instance, FBA or what is called Fulfilled by Amazon, postponed all its pickup schedules for sellers for Monday, where it offers its logistics service to the merchants to deliver products to consumers. Several non-essential item orders are being given delivery estimates of 7-14 days. Amazon is also asking sellers to call consumers to cancel some orders that are already placed but can’t be serviced.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74788685,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-487606,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-comm-cos-continue-to-face-hurdles-in-deliveries/articleshow/74783491.cms

LUCKNOW: After violation of lockdown orders were reported in the city on Monday, district authorities announced measures to restrict movement of people from Tuesday.

No pillion riders will be allowed on two-wheelers and people attending offices have been asked to go straight to their workplace from home and vice versa. Moreover, if a person is moving out for medical emergency, he should carry relevant papers to explain his stand.

A police officer said the decision was taken after the district authorities found people violating prohibitory orders to ensure social distancing and check spread of coronavirus infection.

Police on Monday lodged 87 FIRs against people who were found violating prohibitory orders.

However, it could not deter people from coming out in groups and mingling with others. Three-wheeler commercial vehicles were also seen plying at some places despite ban.

Commissioner of police Sujeet Pandey said, “A total of 122 teams have been formed to visit every part of the city and request people to stay indoors if they have no urgent work. People may contact UP 112 service in case of emergency.”

CHENNAI: Medical insurance premiums saw a spike in February, with the overall growth in health business rising sharply by 42% year-on-year (YoY) — highest in 13 months, compared to a YTD run-rate of 17%.

Retail health policies maintained strong momentum at 15% YoY growth in February, while group health business was up 19% YoY. State-owned insurers saw a sharp 67% growth in business, with United India (up 147% YoY) and Oriental (up 86% YoY) being the growth leaders. They gained market share from private players and specialised standalone players, wrote analysts with Kotak in a note.

Future Generali India Insurance COO Shreeraj Deshpande said, “On retail heath premium underwritten, we have seen about 24% growth in February, which has gone up to 29% in March. On overall growth in health business, we have seen 38% growth as of March compared to the previous year.”

He added that there was no panic buying attributable to the coronavirus crisis yet. However, enquiries have risen by 15-20%.

Ditto for ICICI Lombard. “We call it the JFM phenomenon (JFM is January, February and March — a period when policies are renewed for tax benefits). There is no other specific reason that I see for February growth rising,” said Sanjay Datta, chief (underwriting, claims and reinsurance) at ICICI Lombard General Insurance. He, however, added that there has been an increase in enquiries for medical policies in March. ICICI Lombard launched a separate policy for Covid-19 last week. “We are selling through digital channels and not through agency,” he added.

For Tata AIG General Insurance, sales of retail indemnity health policies have gone up by 85% in February on YoY basis. “Our portfolio was also not very big. However, we have seen a sharp rise in underwriting health premium, which was possible only through our agency network,” said Tata AIG General Insurance head & executive VP (consumer lines) Parag Ved. With the slowdown in businesses of banks and non-banking finance companies, it did not help bring business from their bancassurance partners, he said.

London-based Uday Nagaraju (40), who kicked off #virtualsocialisingchallenge, says he came up with the idea to help the elderly, who are most vulnerable to the virus attack.Virtual socialising could mean anything — a video chat over tea, snacks, lunch, drinks or just a call to say hello. “I have been speaking to my friends virtually, sharing a cup of tea in the absence of being able to actually meet them,” Nagaraju told TOI over phone. He said benefits of his platform were mostly aimed at helping the elderly overcome fears on the virus and combat the pandemic.A co-founder of Global Policy Insights, Nagaraju said he launched the initiative to get people stay in touch with one another without risking their physical well-being. “Extreme social distancing is the only way to minimise the spread of Covid-19. I also feel there an increasing need to raise awareness on the mental health of the people.”He said there is a flood of information on social media and people are confused on which is real news and which is fake news. “It is a huge strain on people’s emotional well-being,” he observed.Among the many people Nagaraju caught up with include British diplomats — David White and Andrew Fleming — deputy country representative of India, UN Women , Nishtha Satyam and film producer Yash Rangineni. When contacted, Fleming, British deputy high commissioner to Telangana, agreed that thanks to the present global situation people were not able to meet their friends.“I strongly subscribe to virtual socialising.

PATNA: The state health department has increased number of beds in government hospitals across the state and asked district magistrates to identify hotels which could be used to quarantine coronavirus suspects.

While number of beds for coronavirus suspects in nine government medical college and hospitals has been increased to 100, all beds in district hospitals will be used for the purpose. Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), which was running with just 20 beds for coronavirus suspects, has converted its 100-bed eye ward into isolation ward.

Even primary health centres (PHCs) have been asked to freeze all the beds, except five to six beds which will be used for pregnant women, state health department additional secretary Kaushal Kishore said.

Five private medical college and hospitals have also been asked to set aside 20 to 50 beds for coronavirus suspects.

There are 534 PHCs in Bihar each having 18 to 30 beds and 36 district hospitals with 80 to 100 beds. Roughly, around 45,000 beds have now been separated in government hospitals in the state for coronavirus suspects.

64,['24/03/2020'],"In view of coronavirus outbreak, Bihar government withdraws orders to attach tax defaulters’ bank accounts","PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Monday said the earlier orders issued to attach the bank accounts of tax defaulters for not clearing dues worth Rs375 crore before GST’s enforcement have been withdrawn. The pending dues pertained to the period before the uniform goods and services tax (GST) regime had come into force in the country, Modi said.He said this and a few other measures have been taken by the government specially in view of the impact of coronavirus.In another such development, the government has also withdrawn its notices served to the tax payers regarding the recovery of tax dues amounting to Rs300 crore in relation to the scrutiny, non-filing of tax and failing to regularly comply with the input tax credit (ITC) rules under the GST Act, he added.Modi told this newspaper that he had also discussed with central revenue secretary R S Pandey the possible steps the Centre could take or should take to give relief to the tax payers under the GST Act.As it transpired from the discussion, the Centre, in fact, has been discussing the critical situation facing the economy with all the stakeholders, including the state governments. The situation has arisen from the impact of coronavirus on the national economy and, accordingly, the Centre would “soon announce an economic package” to arrest the negative impact on the economy that has suddenly come under accentuated slowdown.That apart, as to the relief announced by the Bihar government for the tax payers with regard to the non-compliance with the clearance of the twin tax dues worth Rs675 crore overall, Modi said it should come as a major relief for them to let their trading and business activities going in the critical situation.As to the non-compliance with the payment of tax dues worth Rs375 crore, Modi said it falls in the period before the GST came into force and is related to value added tax (VAT), central sales tax (CST) and entry tax.The banks concerned had been asked to “attach” their bank account numbers to make them clear the dues. It would have impacted 8,033 tax payers. In pursuance of the same, as many as 4,248 notices were issued, which have now been deferred till further order.As to the non-compliance with the clearance of dues under the GST rules regarding scrutiny, non-filing of tax returns, and irregular ITC clearances, the tax payers overall were served with 3,785 notices. However, their implementation has now been withdrawn till further order.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74781633,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-213323,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-withdraws-orders-to-attach-tax-defaulters-bank-a/cs/articleshow/74781200.cms
65,['24/03/2020'],Covid-19 puts huge BS4 vehicle stockin jeopardy,"Chennai: With a lockdown due to Covid-19 and its resultant impact on closed regional transport offices, the unsold stock of BS4 vehicles sitting in car, truck and two wheeler dealerships could be nearly Rs 6,350 crore. These vehicles must be registered by March 31. Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Associations (FADA) president Ashish Harsharaj Kale, “There are 7 lakh two wheelers worth Rs 3,850 crore in dealerships. Add to this 15,000 passenger vehicles worth Rs 1,050 crore and 12,000 trucks worth Rs 1,440 crore.”

The entire stock will become junk on March 31, unless the court extends the BS4 registration timeline beyond April 1. “The Covid-19 impact is severe in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Odisha and Kerala, which have seen 40%-50% drop in footfalls, enquiries and deliveries; moderate in Gujarat, West Bengal, NCR and Punjab; and nominal in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Bihar.” The passenger vehicle inventory is 2-5 days for passenger vehicles, 4-8 days for light commercial vehicles and 12-16 days for two wheelers,” wrote analysts at Crisil, in a note. It is learnt that Maruti has very limited stock (under 300 vehicles unsold last Friday), the situation is different for smaller niche players. Also two wheeler companies have substantial stock at dealerships. “Had this been a normal month, most of the stock would have got consumed but this is not a normal month. So companies that played the high-risk game of keeping inventory in the network will be stuck,” said Vinay Raghunath, head-auto sector, E&Y.As of now, companies are waiting for the Supreme Court to decide on a plea by FADA to extend the 31 March deadline for registering BS4 vehicles.

“The Covid-19 outbreak is an unprecedented situation and we are facing this challenge in India as well. We do have unsold BS4 stock at dealerships but I cannot confirm the exact number. We are hopeful that FADA’s appeal will be given consideration and that the Supreme Court will understand that this is a force majeure situation,” said Rakesh Srivastava, MD, Nissan Motor India.

Apart from the FADA appeal, only Hero Motocorp has taken the decision to move court on its own for an extension of the BS4 cutoff in the context of the “unprecedented force majeure situation prevailing in the country,” said a company spokesman.

“In the normal course, dealers could have easily sold the remaining BS 4 vehicles during the balance period of the month. In fact, our retail sales had been growing at double digits this month before the disruptions set in on account of Covid-19.” The company, he added, could not comment further as the matter is sub judice.

LUCKNOW: People who did not resort to stockpiling of items of daily use had to face major inconvenience on Monday as grocery stores and medical stores in many localities remained closed despite being given exemption under the lockdown till March 25.

The city had witnessed panic buying last week before Sunday’s janata curfew. However, following assurance by the administration that the sale of essential items like grocery, vegetables, medicines, fuel and dairy products will continue, many refrained from buying things in bulk.

On Monday, though, huge crowds were seen at some grocery stores and medical shops because many of their counterparts decided to remain shut. Shops of vegetables, fruits, dairy products and petrol pumps did not witness rush as a sufficient number of them were open.

“This is a difficult situation because we need to avoid public gathering. People are forced to make a beeline here because only a few shops of food items and medicines are open,” said Dheeraj Singh, who was standing in a queue outside a grocery store in Aliganj.

A TOI reality check found very few grocery stores and medical shops open in Mahanagar, Aliganj, Hazratganj, Aashiana and Indiranagar, among other localities. At many places, supermarkets were also closed.

On Jopling Road, grocery shop owners suddenly began pulling down shutters around 1pm, saying police have directed them to do so.

“We pleaded with shopkeepers to at least take our list of items so that we could collect them later but they did not listen,” said Aman Rawat, a resident.

In Jankipuram, Nilesh Agarwal, who was forced to stand in the crowd to buy medicines, said, “The very purpose of lockdown is defeated. The load on this shop would have been distributed had others in the area been open.” In Indiranagar, Mohammad Kafeel said, “I did not find any medicine shop open in my area.”

About 60 barricades put up by police on major roads also caused inconvenience.

Kanika Mishra was not allowed by police to go beyond Balu Adda despite requests that she had to attend to her ailing mother in Dalibagh. Joint commissioner of police, law and order, Naveen Arora said that barricades were meant to check flow of people towards places like commercial hubs or bus and railway stations. This, he added, was done because many people were coming with excuses that they did not know these places were shut.

But, with lack of proper plan and means for generation of funds coupled with the fact that there is less than six months for completing the tenure of the current council, chances are high that most projects will remain on paper.

A mega project for the regeneration of West Kochi is the most important project announced in the budget presented by deputy mayor K R Premakumar. The project christened as ‘West Kochi, Best Kochi’ envisages marking divisions 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 as development Zone-I. Divisions 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 will be earmarked as development Zone-II. Divisions 1-5 have already been marked as area where projects under smart city scheme are to be implemented. For the preparation of DPR, Rs 17.5 crore has been allocated while Rs 32.5 crore will be allotted for the initial works during 2020-21 fiscal. But how will be the local body mobilizing Rs 700 crore required for the project is not clear.

Another mega project announced in the budget is construction of an international convention centre at Palluruthy . Corporation will hold discussions with NRI businessmen for implementing the project as public private partnership (PPP). For meeting the initial expenditure, Rs 1 crore has been allotted. The convention centre will be coming up in the land where Abhaya Kendram, a relief centre owned by the corporation, is functioning. Inmates of the relief centre will be shifted to Abhaya Kendram at Edakochi, which is to be constructed soon. Renovation of five more Abhaya Kendrams operated by the corporation at different parts of the city also will be started and Rs 1 crore has been allotted for the purpose.

For maintenance and renovation of canals in the city, a model project will be implemented. The less used land on the shores of the canals will be used for setting up entertainment facilities, social infrastructure and vending zones.

For carrying out various projects for mosquito control, the local body will spend Rs 12 crore. The corporation will be spending Rs 10 crore for the renovation of anganwadis.

For mobilizing more revenue, collection of various taxes will be expedited. One of the major sources for increasing the revenue of the local body is collection of revised property tax.

To bring a check on people stepping out of their houses, the administration and police are considering to further tighten the norms.

On Monday, the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray imposed a curfew across the state. Acting on the directives, the policemen started using force to disperse any unwanted crowds at public places in the city as well as other parts of the region.

Several senior police officers have confirmed that they will not hesitate from using force in the implementation of the lockdown curfew in their respective jurisdictions. Already several districts have sealed their respective borders and have banned the entry of vehicles except those catering essential services.

Aurangabad district collector Uday Choudhary said, “Our orders to imposing restrictions from time to time, are in consonance with the latest directives issued by the state chief secretary and we are implementing the same effectively.”

He said that the administration will initiate stringent action against industrial houses for violating the orders by asking them to close their businesses till March 31. Authorities appealed people to come forward and alert the respective administrations as well as the police if anyone is violating the orders.

Aurangabad commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad said that starting from Monday, the majority of the police force would remain on city roads to ensure effective implementation of the state government orders. “However, we will not tolerate people violating the lockdown orders,” said CP Prasad.

As per the orders issued by the chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, all other district collectors of remaining seven districts of Marathwada — Beed, Jalna, Osmanabad, Parbhani, Hingoli, Latur and Nanded — have been asked to follow the same orders. However, this order shall not apply to medical emergencies, the order read.

At one place, the order states that ‘All enforcing authorities to note that fundamentally strict restrictions relate to the movement of people but not to goods and commodities as a matter of principle.’

HYDERABAD: The cabinet sub-committee report on allegations of irregularities involving top TDP leaders is back in focus with Andhra Pradesh government handing over the Amaravati land scam probe to CBI .

The government while issuing a GO of handing over the case to CBI highlighted the irregularities committed by persons officiating in the erstwhile government of AP while designating the new capital area, which were reported by the cabinet sub-committee.

The report alleged that former AP chief minister Chandrababu Naidu ’s Heritage Foods Private Ltd had purchased 14 acres (11 sale deed transactions) in Kantheru in Tadikonda of Guntur. It claimed that purchases were made through intermediaries like Lingamaneni Ramesh and Lingameni Rajashekar who obtained general power of attorney from the owners of the land in 2014.

The report also alleged that Lingamaneni group, which had a large land bank, gained immensely owing to the designing of the capital area in such a way that the boundary area of the core capital ended in the villages just adjacent to the villages where they had the lands. These lands also did not fall under the land pooling scheme zone.

The inner ring road was designed in such a manner that it passed only a few metres away from the lands of the LEPL Projects, it said and also mentioned that Naidu was provided a rent-free accommodation in the two-storeyed building at Undavalli on the banks of river Krishna.

CID had booked two cases in connection with Amaravati land scam. The same was also handed over to CBI. CID in the investigation said an examination of former sub-registrars had led to the unearthing of modus operandi of illegal transfer of assigned lands of low-income families in CRDA to some persons in power.

It is estimated that an extent of 500 acres of assigned land worth Rs 500 crore was acquired from SC and ST farmers at cheap rates.

M Sambasiva Rao , president of Heritage Foods, however, denied these charges. “We are pained to see repeated allegations made against Heritage Foods. The land acquired by Heritage Foods in Guntur district during 2014 is not located in any of the 29 villages of Amaravati. An extent of 14 acres was purchased in Kantheru during July and August 204 for setting up a dairy factory,” he said.

He further said this land is located 20 km away from the capital in Guntur. “Sale registration of part of the land in 4.5 acres was cancelled during October 2014 over a dispute. The company now holds 9.6 acres in Kantheru,” he said.

Rao said if the land purchase was based on internal trading as alleged, “we could have purchased in any of the 29 villages of Amaravati capital itself and not in Kantheru, which is located away from the capital. “The acquisition of the land is for business expansion and not for trading,” he said.

Heritage Foods had also purchased land during 2014 in different states. “Heritage Foods is operating in 14 states, and is a public listed compan,” he added.

NEW DELHI: Traffic police have issued 49,735 challans on Sunday based on the videos captured in the cameras installed around the city. Police officers said that almost all these challans were related to speeding or jumping a traffic light.

A senior officer said that since the roads were empty due to the lockdown since Sunday, drivers were found speeding on some of the stretches and were captured in the speed cameras.

The drivers would be booked under the new provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act that was notified earlier last week by Delhi government. They would now have to pay fines of more than Rs 1,000 for jumping a traffic signal.

Cops said that the challan figures showed a sudden jump on Sunday due to the empty roads, the figures usually remain within 10,000-12,000 per day under the camera-based prosecutions.

The speed cameras installed under the ITMS programme had become ineffective since police were not allowed to issue notices to collect fines.

As soon as this became evident among motorists, most drivers were found violating norms despite being caught on camera. Officers said that most people are still unaware that the speed cameras have been brought back to order.

Along with the astronomical fines recommended in the new MV Act, the camera-based challan system was meant to deter motorists from speeding, racing and stunt biking, police officers said.

The same number of undertrial prisoners who are eligible for interim bail would be released.Goel said the jail authorities will hold meetings with legal experts from the Delhi government to screen these inmates and consider each case before the final release. The prisoners who are likely to be released have, however, been informed about it.Jail sources say that most of the inmates who are to be released would be either foreign prisoners who have nearly completed their jail terms or those whose bail pleas are still being considered. The jail authorities would first send a list of these prisoners to the court after which clearance would be given based on which the release documents will be prepared.Earlier in the day, Delhi government had told the high court that it planned to decongest the prisons in wake of the novel coronavirus menace and would be taking immediate steps. It said that for convicts, special parole and furlough provisions had been made, while for undertrials – who form a majority of inmates – it was drawing up a plan for 45-day bail in non-heinous cases for which an undertrial has spent three months in jail.For this purpose it will amend prison rules, the government told a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad which was hearing a plea by advocate Shobha Gupta seeking decongestion of the prisons in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Delhi government’s additional standing counsel, Anuj Aggarwal, told the bench that a notification will be issued within a day to amend the prison rules to include new provisions after which HC disposed of the matter, taking note that a similar issue has been taken up by the Supreme Court suo moto where it also issued directions on Monday.The government plans to provide a 60-day parole in one spell in case of emergent situations like an epidemic or a natural disaster or any other situation which warrants easing of the inmate population for convicts while another provision will provide for temporary facility of a special furlough. These provisions will be available for eligible prisoners who have served a minimum one year of the sentence awarded to them, Aggarwal told the court.As regards undertrials, HC noted in its order the stand of the government that it wants to reduce the number by fast-tracking their bail process or by granting interim bail on a personal bond to those booked for offences where punishment is seven years or less and the inmate has completed minimum three months in jail.Aggarwal said Delhi State Legal Services Authority and the district judge concerned will be holding a meeting to work out the modalities.Meanwhile, jail officials have stopped one-to-one meetings between inmates and their family members.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74784046,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-271286,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tihar-will-release-3000-to-decongest-jail/articleshow/74783460.cms

97,['24/03/2020'],"Promoters caught in Rera &amp; Covid-19 crisis, home possession to be delayed","Aurangabad: The real estate market is staring at a major crisis with promoters having a tough time in complying with MahaRERA deadline amid the outbreak of COVID-19.The slowdown in the real estate sector is going to affect the buyers as delays are likely to creep in for the possession of their dream homes.Around 300 ongoing construction projects in the city and outskirts could get delayed by varying time frames as against the stipulated deadlines, CREDAI office-bearers said. The actual number of projects is expected to be more considering the construction activities of non-CREDAI members.Sunil Bedmutha, secretary of Aurangabad chapter president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI), said the construction activities were almost stalled due to the current shut down. “The outbreak of COVID-19 was an unforeseen crisis which has caught the builders and promoters off guard. Besides slump in ongoing projects, the fresh booking inquires have been also plummeted in an unprecedented manner amid shut down due to COVID-19,” he said.Bedmutha said the flow of capital in the real-estate sector has been almost stalled. “The payment from many buyers has been stuck due to the current shut down. As per the latest directive, the banks have been asked not to undertake loan-related work that also includes home-loan. The shut down as well as a dearth of funds is going to delay the ongoing projects,” he said.The CREDAI has approached Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) with a plea to relax the existing rules in case of delayed possession of homes. The official regulator in the field of real-estate, MahaRERA can ask the promoter to pay the home buyer a monthly house rent and penalty as well for the delayed possession of flats.“The COVID-19 is a natural calamity and therefore any delay in handing over the home to buyers is inevitable. MahaRERA authorities must show a lenient approach towards the promoters,” CREDAI office-bearers said.Praveen Gunjkar, a buyer who has booked his dream home, was expected to get possession in June. “The builder had assured us that we can shift to our new home by the start of Monsoon. I now fear delayed possession considering the overall set of conditions. Such a delay would hamper my future planning including terminating rent-agreement with landlord and shifting of my child to a new school,” he said.Meanwhile, the current slump in the real-estate may offer an opportunistic time for buyers to secure the property deals at a relatively lower cost. “The COVID-19 crisis will have an adverse impact on the real estate sector and shortfall of capital is imminent even if the current crisis subsides over a period of next few weeks. The builders and promoters are to be in dire need of money once the shut down is over and could offer concession and attractive schemes for buyers,” Jitendra Limbekar, a real-estate agent said.",aurangabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/promoters-caught-in-rera-covid-19-crisis-home-possession-to-be-delayed/articleshow/74782714.cms

GUNTUR: Making a retreat, the governing council of Guntur agriculture market committee has decided to close down the yard from Tuesday. The yard will remain closed till March, 31. Following a report in TOI on March 21 “10k throng Guntur market yard as officials throw caution to winds”, the state government has directed the committee to follow lock-down orders.

The yard governing council met late on Sunday evening and took the decision to suspend transactions. Market yard chairman Ch Yesurathnam appealed to farmers to not bring the stocks to the yard till March 31. However, the committee went ahead with transactions on Monday as the decision to declare holidays was taken late on Sunday. About 1.2 lakh bags of stock arrived to the yard on Monday. The farmers and traders were advised to complete the transactions by evening as the yard would be shut down by midnight.

On March 21, agriculture minister Kurasala Kannababu and market yard chairman Ch Yesurthnam had said operations at the agriculture market places will continue without break despite restrictions on other businesses in the state. They argued that keeping the market yards open will allow farmers to sell their produces at reasonable remunerative prices.

However, TOI in its report on Saturday highlighted the presence of over 10,000 people in the Guntur agriculture market, the biggest market place in the country, that might put thousands of lives at risk in the wake of the fast-spreading coronavirus. The presence of exporters from other states, including ones where COVID-19 cases have been reported, is particularly a cause of concern.

100,['24/03/2020'],AP orders CBI probe into Amaravati land scam,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: The cabinet sub-committee report on allegations of irregularities involving top TDP leaders is back in focus with Andhra Pradesh government handing over the Amaravati land scam probe to CBI .

The government while issuing a GO of handing over the case to CBI highlighted the irregularities committed by persons officiating in the erstwhile government of AP while designating the new capital area, which were reported by the cabinet sub-committee.

The report alleged that former AP chief minister Chandrababu Naidu ’s Heritage Foods Private Ltd had purchased 14 acres (11 sale deed transactions) in Kantheru in Tadikonda of Guntur. It claimed that purchases were made through intermediaries like Lingamaneni Ramesh and Lingameni Rajashekar who obtained general power of attorney from the owners of the land in 2014.

The report also alleged that Lingamaneni group, which had a large land bank, gained immensely owing to the designing of the capital area in such a way that the boundary area of the core capital ended in the villages just adjacent to the villages where they had the lands. These lands also did not fall under the land pooling scheme zone.

The inner ring road was designed in such a manner that it passed only a few metres away from the lands of the LEPL Projects, it said and also mentioned that Naidu was provided a rent-free accommodation in the two-storeyed building at Undavalli on the banks of river Krishna.

CID had booked two cases in connection with Amaravati land scam. The same was also handed over to CBI. CID in the investigation said an examination of former sub-registrars had led to the unearthing of modus operandi of illegal transfer of assigned lands of low-income families in CRDA to some persons in power.

It is estimated that an extent of 500 acres of assigned land worth Rs 500 crore was acquired from SC and ST farmers at cheap rates.

M Sambasiva Rao , president of Heritage Foods, however, denied these charges. “We are pained to see repeated allegations made against Heritage Foods. The land acquired by Heritage Foods in Guntur district during 2014 is not located in any of the 29 villages of Amaravati. An extent of 14 acres was purchased in Kantheru during July and August 204 for setting up a dairy factory,” he said.

He further said this land is located 20 km away from the capital in Guntur. “Sale registration of part of the land in 4.5 acres was cancelled during October 2014 over a dispute. The company now holds 9.6 acres in Kantheru,” he said.

Rao said if the land purchase was based on internal trading as alleged, “we could have purchased in any of the 29 villages of Amaravati capital itself and not in Kantheru, which is located away from the capital. “The acquisition of the land is for business expansion and not for trading,” he said.

Heritage Foods had also purchased land during 2014 in different states. “Heritage Foods is operating in 14 states, and is a public listed compan,” he added.

But hours after the state government’s announcement on statewide lockdown, mofussil bus stands especially Singanallur bus stand were crowded with passengers who wanted to travel to other districts as both the mofussil and town bus services would be suspended from 6pm on Tuesday.

TNSTC operates 2,641 buses – both town buses and mofussil – in four districts. It has stopped the services of 891 buses as on Monday due to reduction in passenger count, an official from TNSTC said.

“We have cancelled all the bus services from the four districts to Chennai from Monday onwards,” the official said. On March 18, the department has stopped the services of 43 buses to Kerala and 30 to Karnataka till March 31, the official pointed out.

A mofussil bus driver said, “The number of passengers who travel from Coimbatore to other districts, have considerably come down and we have been operating the buses only with a handful of passengers in the last few days. We have been operating buses on losses.”

“Number of passengers from Salem and Erode districts to KMCH has also come down. This shows about the awareness people have on avoiding crowds and stepping out of their house unwantedly,” he added.

In the evening, there was a huge rush in bus stands in the city to catch buses to other districts. Buses to districts including Trichy , Theni and Madurai are operated from Singanallur bus stand.

A passenger, Sushma said, “After waiting for two hours, I couldn’t manage to board a bus to Theni. It was too crowded. I lost my patience and planning to returning to my hostel.”

104,['24/03/2020'],"Work from home: As work-from-home picks up, pets double up as co-workers","A large chunk of people are working out of their homes following the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. The long hours of computer screens, tea breaks, chats next to the coffee machine and bitching sessions with co-workers are out of bounds for a while, but many have found new co-workers at home- pets!Quarantine periods can get boring after a while but those who have pets for company are bound to feel otherwise. Pet pooches are making the work from home (WFH) experience quite interesting for their human parents.Be it taking over the laptop keyboard or snuggling up on their laps as they work on that pending presentation, pets are taking over the home workstations and even video-bombing online meetings.Neha Rajadhyaksha’s co-workers, Pepper (an African grey parrot) and the fur ball Dodo, make sure they invade her working space. Although it’s a little disturbing, Neha doesn’t mind the invasion. “They are always interested in what I am doing and will be present to share food, the moment I start eating something. They are like office co-workers only, just from different species,” laughs Neha, a social media executive, adding, “I had thought I’d get some space since I am working from home, but the joke is on me. Pepper cannot keep quiet and is always singing and whistling, like the annoying co-worker who just refuses to shut up! But even though they are annoying, the cuddles, kisses and genuine love from them more than makes up for the disturbance.”Speaking of disturbance, Arpita Bhattacharya has been on the receiving end of some from her pooch, Muffin, while on video conferences. She shares, “Whenever I am on a call with my boss or have a conference call, Muffin drags all his squeaky toys and starts making noises and begs for attention. I have to mute my call and instruct him not to do so. But, according to Muffin, why should his human have all the fun at meeting calls?” Echoing Arpita’s experience, business consultant Richa Thakur adds, “Cloud, my one-year-old Indian Spitz, loves meetings, unlike me. He always keeps looking at my laptop screen whenever I start working. Whenever we have conference calls, he will sit on my lap and try to be a part of the meeting. He loves to steal my thunder on conference calls.”Like Muffin, Ashish Sharma’s Labrador Castiel loves meetings too. In fact, Castiel is a good listener when Ashish wants to bounce off some coding ideas as well. Ashish says, “I am a developer/programmer. For me, it is helpful to work in teams to discuss ideas and brainstorm. Now, with WFH, I talk to my new co-worker, Castiel. He gives good feedback by rotating his head or tilting it sideways. I think I have made peace with my new colleague.”Teammates are fine, but what about that worker who always asks for a tea break and finally convinces you to tag along? IT professional Rutuja Telkikar’s fur baby Ronny is not quite the tea lover, but a ‘let’s take a break’ all the time kind of colleague. Rutuja quips, “Ronny is sometimes irritating since he seeks attention by keeping his paws on the keyboard or by staring at me with those button eyes until I finally agree to play with him.” Sharing an incident, she adds, “Once I was typing a harsh mail and Ronny accidentally sent out that mail. My manager gave me an earful after that. Ronny has also sent out meaningless messages through Skype at times. But hey, I am not complaining!”While most of the furry babies are co-workers, some of them are bosses. Take Kapil Patwardhan’s Kaiser, for example. “When Kaiser demands a break, I take a break from work. When he demands a snack, I snack. When he demands a nap, I have to continue working. Things work his way in our house. But Kaiser’s fun and fuss-free, provided the treats keep coming in,” laughs Kapil.~Pictures shared by pet owners",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74775929,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-757434/74775929.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/relationships/pets/as-work-from-home-picks-up-pets-double-up-as-co-workers/articleshow/74775929.cms

The state power utility has appealed to the consumers to either submit the meter reading using the mobile app or pay an average bill . Similarly, the MSEDCL has decided that it will not distribute hard copy of electricity bills to consumers as preventive measure and consumers are requested to opt for the soft copy of the bills available on the official website.

“State energy minister Nitin Raut has ordered against visiting homes of consumers for noting down the meter reading and distribution of bills in order to curb the possible spread of Covid-19. The consumers are therefore requested to use the mobile app in the current time of crisis,” MSEDCL public relations officer (Aurangabad Zone) Dnyaneshwar Ardad said.

The MSEDCL has also been asked not to visit consumer premises for spot-verification, attending billing complaints, disconnection of power supply and detection of power thefts till further instructions.

The mobile application can be downloaded on any mobile phone and the self-submission facility is part of the application that enables the consumers to submit meter reading on their own to avoid receiving average billing.

As per laid down procedure, a system generated SMS is sent on registered mobile number of the consumers, asking for self-submission of meter reading within 48-hours, if the reading is not taken by the ground staff.

Besides, the app also offers a wide range of benefits to the customers including viewing and paying of monthly bills and routing complaints besides self-submission of power reading.

Notably, the percentage of average billing, as per laid down norms, ideally has to be below 5%, but the rule has been relaxed to contain the spread of Covid-19.

As per the state power utility records, Aurangabad city alone has nearly 2.62 lakh consumers while rural areas from the district have another 4.9 lakh plus consumers— including domestic, commercial, high-tension and water-supply scheme connections.

Surat: She had joined her neighbours in clanging thalis to cheer Coronavirus foot soldiers on Sunday evening. But moments later everyone froze in shock and disbelief as the 35-year-old woman met a painful death.

The woman Amisha Naik was badly stung by a swarm of honey bees on the terrace of her house in Kasturi Apartment in Navsari.

While most of them started running helter-skelter to save themselves, some of the neighbours tried to rescue her by throwing water on her body.

But Naik started vomiting and fell unconscious.

She was taken to a private hospital where doctors declared her dead on admission.

Husband of the deceased, Bankim Chandra Naik, who lodged a complaint at the Navsari town police station stated that he also went on the terrace, but seeing the swarm of honey bees, he immediately rushed down and went inside the house.

The neighbours then informed the husband about the incident and they immediately took the victim to the private hospital.

A police officer of Navsari town police said, “There was a massive beehive on the terrace of the building, which had gone unnoticed by the residents. Due to the beating of the thalis, the honey bees attacked those on the terrace. While most of them managed to escape from the spot, the woman was attacked by the bees.”

He added, “The woman was stung by the honey bees all over her body. We have sent the body for post mortem at the civil hospital and the reports are awaited.”

The daily garbage collectors and ragpickers are being exposed to bio-medical hazards, jeopardising Delhi’s Covid-19 containment strategy.In the current garbage management system, mixed waste is dumped in receptacles or dumps where ragpickers comb the thrash for reusable items with their bare hands. In household garbage these days are discarded masks, gloves, tissues and other soiled items. “These should be a separate collection system for such items,” said Chitra Mukherjee, head of operations at Chintan Environment Research and Action Group, which works extensively with ragpickers. “It is irresponsible of the civic authorities to let these potentially hazardous items end up in dhalaos and landfills.”Mukherjee said that such items could not be recycled so the only solution was to collect them separately and incinerate them. The waste collectors have reported that used face masks have no resale value, but there is fear in the community about the novel coronavirus infection.Swati Sambyal, an expert in solid municipal waste management, said at a time when more biomedical, plastic and other hazardous waste is being generated due to the coronavirus outbreak, household segregation of garbage assumed new importance. “All those instructed to be in home quarantine should not mix their garbage. They need to segregate it properly,” Sambyal emphasised. “Such households should not hand over waste every day to reduce the garbage collectors exposure to the virus. The garbage bags should be sealed and the municipality should ensure a separate vehicle to transport it for incineration.”Under the new Central Pollution Control Board guidelines, medical waste is to be thrown in a yellow bag. The municipal bodies have been instructed to engage biomedical waste treatment facilities to pick up such waste from houses or from designated spots. Delhi, which generated 27 tonnes of biomedical waste daily before the Covid-19 crisis began, has the capacity to process 63 tonnes of such waste.A South Delhi Municipal Corporation official said that at a meeting on Monday, biomedical waste concessionaires have been asked to depute two vehicles for every municipal zone to pick up garbage from quarantined homes. “All five local bodies are starting this service,” the official informed. “This waste will be sent to incinerators.”The official admitted that civic officials were negligent till date but a system would be quickly put into place to handle bio-hazard waste. “We still don’t know how to tackle the masks coming from non-quarantined houses,” he added.

The police managed to clear up the station premises by 1pm. “It is unfair to shut down train services at a time when lots of people are still stuck in the city,” said a resident of Bhoiguda, who was looking for a way to go to his hometown Guntur.

“Sir, what’s the use of lockdown declared, today majority of them are breaking this rule near Secunderabad railway station, completely ignoring the orders of state government,” a local resident tweeted and tagged the city police. A few passengers returning from other places were also spotted.

Railway authorities said that many passengers were found hiding in restrooms and not abiding by social distancing norms. Some even refused to undergo thermal screening before leaving the station premises.

“We are making sure that people do not crowd the railway stations now that train services have been cancelled. With RPF and GRP personnel deployed, we are keeping an eye on anyone trying to enter the stations,” a South Central Railway official told TOI.

The managements of the supermarkets, too, did very little to either control the crowd or at least take measures to ensure safe distance between customers while shopping and billing.

Tirupati municipal commissioner PS Girisha said an overcrowded leading hypermarket in the city was shutdown on Monday. ‘‘We have given instructions to leading supermarket chains in the city to avoid overcrowding of people, else we will initiate stern action against them”, he asserted.

127,['24/03/2020'],Curbs on truck movement may lead to crunch: Grocers,"Nashik: A section of grocery traders is apprehensive that the city could face shortage of essentials in the near future as movement of trucks from different parts of the country has slowed down arrival of the commodities.

They said sago comes from Andhra Pradesh, groundnut and wheat comes from Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, respectively. Most of the other grocery items also come from other districts.

Moreover, some consumers are resorting to panic buying, although the state government has made it clear that shops selling essential items like grocery and medicines would not be closed down.

Grocery traders said transport charges have also increased and that has led to a rise in some grocery items by Rs 4-5 a kg.

When contacted, Prafulla Sancheti, president of Nashik grocery traders’ association, said people are rushing to buy grocery and they are purchasing excessively for one or two months.

“Presently, there is no scarcity, but it is likely to be after two-three days as the movement of trucks is likely to be affected. Although transporting of essentials is allowed, some transporters and drivers are not taking the risk,” said Sancheti.

Sancheti said they had tried to give home delivery to consumers by getting orders on Whatsapp. But rickshaws are not operating and most workers are not ready for home delivery.

“We are not getting grocery items from outside as drivers of the transporting trucks are not taking risks. Moreover, vehicles have been halted at some spots. This may overall create scarcity of grocery items in the next few days,” said Rohit Daga, a grocery wholesaler and retailer.

People are unnecessarily creating crowd at some grocery shops and buying excessively.

They should buy as per their requirement. Because there are also some daily wage earners and other poor people, who buy grocery items on daily basis, said Daga.

LUCKNOW: Non-coronavirus patients , who visited six hospitals designated for the treatment of Covid-19 cases, had a tough time on Monday when they found the general OPDs closed.Patients, who came from far off places and returned disappointed, said it was good that the administration was serious in its fight against coronavirus but it should not ignore general patients. They said instead of closing OPDs for general patients, hospital authorities could set up OPDs for Covid-19 patients in separate buildings.General OPDs have been shut at SGPGI, KGMU, Balrampur Hospital, Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS), SPM Civil Hospital and Lok Bandhu Hospital.More than 4,000 patients report at KGMU’s general OPDs while SGPGIMS receives at least 2,000 patients on a daily basis. On an average, RMLIMS receives 1,500 patients, Balrampur Hospital gets 2,000 while Civil Hospital and Lok Bandhu Hospital get 1,000 and 500 patients daily. These hospitals have decided to admit only suspected/confirmed Covid-19 cases and offer emergency and super-specialty services.Shahbaz Alam (32) from Hardoi, who visited SGPGIMS to get his pregnant wife examined by a super specialist, said: “My wife was admitted to KGMU where doctors told us that the unborn baby is suffering from a deformity in heart which could also be dangerous for the mother. They referred her to SGPGIMS but new OPD registrations are not being made here. I don’t know where to go now.” “Doctors in Sitapur referred my father to KGMU as they could not diagnose his problem which is constantly aggravating. I cannot afford a private hospital,” he added.Sushil Singh, who visited KGMU for follow-up treatment of her sister who had a surgery recently, said: “We wanted to see the doctor as she is still feeling pain.

People were seen roaming on bikes and cars in some districts, especially in Ludhiana and Ferozepur, for hours after the announcement.Jalandhar: Deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said they had given a few concessions during lockdown allowing one person per family to get essentials but people came out in big numbers. “We were left with no option but to impose curfew to ensure check of virus spread. There will be no concessions for now and violators would be rounded up,” he said.There were different responses to the lockdown prior to the curfew. If it was a near-complete shutdown in Nawanshahr with only chemists allowed to open shops, Jalandhar saw lot of people moving around. However, after curfew was announced, civil and police officials got the bazaars closed and had to get tough at a few places.The curfew spelt problems for private hospitals and patients as the staff could not turn up. Phagwara resident Pawan Duggal, whose father needed immediate hospitalization on Monday, was told by the doctors that if the staff couldn’t reach due to curfew, then he would discharge the patient.Ferozepur: Little impact of curfew was observed in Ferozepur defeating its purpose. The local civil and police administration failed in implementing the curfew orders on the ground as people could be seen roaming in vehicles and hawkers selling vegetables in a residential locality .Deputy commissioner Kulwant Singh said the restrictions will not apply to defence, paramilitary , government officers and employees on duty as well as essential services and establishments. He said 140 special executive magistrates-cum-surveillance officers have been deployed in the district to keep an eye on the law and order situation and to ensure proper implementation of curfew orders.Bathinda: Day after the ‘Janta Curfew’, people spilled out on roads and at markets in Bathinda, Muktsar, Faridkot, Moga, Mansa and Barnala, totally ignoring the lockdown orders.Bathinda deputy commissioner B Srinivasan and SSP Nanak Singh, Muktsar deputy commissioner MK Aravind Kumar and SSP Raj Bachan Singh Sandhu led the police force in taking out flag marches. Barnala deputy commissioner Tej Partap Singh Phoolka and SSP Sandeep Goel visited many places in the town asking people to return to their homes or strict action would be taken against them. The DCs said that the police had been asked to make people strictly comply with the curfew and allow relaxation only in emergency cases.Amritsar: As compared to the complete lockdown on Sunday, a number of people in Amritsar went about their daily routine even after the curfew. Many motorists were intercepted by policemen and advised to return to home. At many places cops could be seen imploring commuters to go home. Grocery shops , dairies and chemist shops remained open during the day time. Amritsar deputy commissioner Shivdular Singh Dhillon informed that curfew had been imposed from March 23 till further orders. He said people had been directed not to leave their homes or suitable action would be taken against them.Gurdaspur: DC Mohammad Ishfaq said that he had allowed home delivery of milk, one-time relaxation to vehicles carrying fodder or animals or perishable goods. Milk procurement would begin in the district by 5 am and home delivery would be allowed till 9 am. He said the administration had discouraged selling of milk from shops in apprehension of a lot of people gathering at a place. People coming from other cities who had a valid reason to enter the district were given one-time permission to enter the district.Tarn Taran: DC Pardeep Sabharwal said the district administration had set up a control room to provide help while 5 officials had been specially deputed to ensure that essential services were not hampered .In Gurdaspur, samples of one more suspected coronavirus patient were sent for virology test, said the DC.

133,['24/03/2020'],10K textile units in Tirupur to shut down until March 31,"Coimbatore: After holding talks with the Tirupur district administration authorities on Monday, representatives of all textile industry units and allied units decided to close their units till March 31 amid Covid-19 scare.

Stakeholders say this would mean around 10,000 textile and garment units across the textile value chain would remain shut and around 6 lakh workers, most of them from other districts and migrants from other states, would go jobless till the end of the month.

President of the Tirupur Exporters Association Raja M Shanmugam said they had taken the decision to shut down as there was a risk of transactions between Erode and Tirupur. “If there is an outbreak, it would be difficult to control in a city like Tirupur, so in the best of interests we have decided to shutdown till March 31,” he said.

He said they have also asked workers to avoid gatherings and unnecessary movements. “We have given them safety advice. Those staying in hostels have to stay inside,” he said.

However, there is a tug of war between the industry and trade unions on payment of salary for the shut-down period.

Shanmugam said as the sector was reeling under a crisis, it would not be right to expect the unit owners to pay the workers for non-working days. “The Centre should take a preemptive measure and dole out compensatory pay to workers for the shut-down period,” he said. He said the sector had faced a revenue hit to the tune of Rs5,000crore due to the slowdown and another Rs2,500crore due to production hit this month.

Trade union representatives, meanwhile, cited the Industrial Disputes Act which said the industry should pay salary for ‘non-working’ days.

N Sekar, general secretary of All India Trade Union Congress ’ (AITUC) Baniyan Factory Labour Union , said the Act states that half of the workers’ pay should be given to them during lockout period. “Industrialists have the right to say they are in a difficult situation, but they can’t deny salary. They can pay a part of the salary and appeal to the Centre to bear the rest. This is crucial because exports from Tirupur amount to around 45% of the nation’s exports,” he said.

Unionists said more than 60% of the 6 lakh workers were from other districts and migrant labourers from other states. A lockout situation without pay would cause serious social disruption and unrest, they said.

G Sampath, general secretary of Centre of Indian Trade Unions’ (CITU) Baniyan Industry Workers’ union said a place like Tirupur with a huge migrant labour population faced a risk of social unrest in the case of a lockdown without pay. “The industry should ensure that the workers get all benefits they got while the sector functioned,” he said.

If the situation continues, there would be shortage of vegetables leading to increase in prices, according to merchants.

The city depends on Karnataka for 60% of its vegetable needs. With the border between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu sealed for vehicular traffic, the number of trucks transporting vegetables from the neighbouring state has reduced by half.

S A Basheer, a merchant at the MGR Vegetable Wholesale Market on Mettupalayam Road, said usually on a day there would be more than 300 trucks from Karnataka unloading vegetables in the market, but on Monday, the number halved. “Tomatoes, shallots and green chillies are some of the important vegetables we get from there. On Monday, there was very low stock in the market. At the market, all vegetable prices had increased by Rs10-Rs20 per kilo. If the situation continues, there would be a further increase,” he said.

Though the state had announced that vehicles carrying vegetables, milk and other essentials can travel between the states, at places there were issues such as vehicles which had unloaded vegetables not being allowed to return.

“Because of this, trucks have doubled their fares. To solve these issues, the state should give a certificate to vehicles which transport vegetables for smooth two-way travel,” he said.

CM Palanisamy, a representative of the MGR market’s trader’s association, said due to the imposing of section144 there would be a scarcity of works who would harvest vegetables, procure them and load them. “If there is no inflow of stock, the prices may rise further,” he said.

On the other hand, around 30% of Kerala’s vegetables are exported from the district. If there is no smooth movement of vehicles between the two states, produce from the district could not be exported and there was a risk of it being dumped, merchants said.

Meanwhile, the eight Uzhavar Santhais in the district, where farmers can market their produce directly, have been closed till March 31.

It begins one of the biggest exercise to track the suspected carriers. The MP officials have been provided with the name, contact details and address of the suspects. Till the last report came the MP officials have failed to confirm the tracking of even a single suspect...

Back in the state, the spread in Bhilwara has left the health workers with the herculean task of tracking suspects in 8-10 districts of Rajasthan. Officials told that most of the suspect’s phone numbers are switched off or no response making it difficult to track them. The tracking of these suspects is being done by the health workers of the respective districts.

“It is true that we have not able to track many suspects who are in the critical category due to unclear addresses, wrong village names and in many cases, the suspect has fled the village fearing being taken away by us,” said an official.

Another worry for the city is to monitor the 5392 home isolation suspects which is probably the highest in any tier III city.

CNP sources said it was given a target of printing 620 crore pieces of currency notes and it has already met 99% of the target.

Apart from CNP, another unit — India Security Press (ISP) — will also remain shut. ISP Nashik prints revenue stamps, stamp papers, passports and visas.

ISP sources said they have almost met the target of printing 1.5 crore passports and 26 crore stamp papers.

“The decision to shut operations at both CNP and ISP had been taken on Sunday evening following the state government imposing section 144. Now, we have stopped operations at both the units of SPMCIL in Nashik till March 31,” said sources from SPMCIL.

Total printing target for CNP Nashik for the current financial year (2019-20) was 620 crore pieces of currency notes of denominations — Rs 500, Rs 100, Rs 50, Rs 20 and Rs 10.

“We have already completed 99% of target and there are adequate currency notes available with the RBI. Therefore, there is nothing worry about even though the CNP remains closed till March 31,” said the sources.

HYDERABAD: A day after the Telangana government declared lockdown till March 31, hundreds of students, planning to go back to their home towns, were found stranded in the city due to closure of hostels , cancellation of flights and other modes of transport.

Last week, several educational institutions had declared closure of hostels and instructed students to vacate them at the earliest. Many students who were staying at private hostels too got similar orders. However, due to cancellation of flights and sealing of borders by many states, students could not go back to their home towns.

“Around 200 students were expected to travel to places like Kerala, Ladakh and north-eastern states. But due to reasons such as lockdown in the states and high price of domestic flight tickets,they were unable to travel,” University of Hyderabad Students Union president Abhishek Nandan said.

Earlier, UoH had asked all students to vacate hostels by 10am on March 23. However, following requests, the administration decided to keep the hostels open with limited facilities, but with a rider. They have to sign an undertaking. “Taking into consideration the welfare of students who are from far-off places as well as that of service staff of the university, the hostels will be run with common and basic mess facilities with skeletal staff and the campus health centre will cater only to emergency medical services,” a release by UoH said.

UoH however, asked all students from Telangana to vacate the hostels by Tuesday. “As entire Telangana is under lockdown, they should consider plight of students from the state as well as there are no buses or trains plying in the state,” Nandan added. Other students living in private hostels too faced similar issues as managements evicted them.

Since food joints are closed in various areas of the city, this group of citizens took up responsibility to make sure that the warriors in the frontline to fight the novel coronavirus are offered water, snacks or food.

Harpreet Singh Basoor and Nuruddin Batliwala, astride a two-wheeler, were among those seen distributing packaged drinking water among policemen.“The days are getting hotter and these policemen are on duty without worrying about themselves. They have to run around in the scorching sun to stop overcrowding in the streets so that citizens can be safe from the fast spreading coronavirus,” said Basoor.

Ravindra Deo, a retired medical professional, saw a group of traffic police deployed in the Dwarka area on Sunday. Hotels and restaurants were closed that day due to the “janata curfew”. Around 10.30 am, he brought tea and biscuits and offered them to the traffic cops.

“Around 10 police personnel were working since morning. My son-in-law and I thought of giving them at least tea and biscuits as no shop was open in the area. It was immense pleasure to see them happy. They looked relieved of the work pressure for a while,” Deo told TOI.

Deo also went to Dwarka Circle on Monday and served tea to policemen on duty there. “I went out at 6am with tea in a flask as they were working since last night without having anything. At least that much I could do for them,” he added.

HYDERABAD: With the Centre banning export of certain medicines to other countries, especially Europe and the US, in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, pharma industry has hundreds of crores worth consignments lying at ports ready for shipment to oversees destinations.

India is known as ‘Pharmacy of the World’ and over 30% of about 5,000 pharmaceutical units are located in the two Telugus states, mostly in and around Hyderabad.

Pharma exporters claim consignments worth hundreds of crores were lined up for export at ports waiting for the Centre’s permission as it had recently imposed curbs by amending the export policy.

Hyderabad-based Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India ( Pharmexcil ) has already dashed off letters to Directorate-General of Foreign Trade , which functions under the Union ministry of commerce and industry, and secretary of ministry of commerce on the issue in the last 10 days urging the Centre to relax norms.

“India has been consistently registering over 10% growth year on year. When it comes to monthly growth, December and January saw 12% and 11% growth respectively compared to the cumulative period, while it has come down to 2.85% in February. This may dwindle this month,” a representative of Pharmexcil, a body set up by the ministry of commerce & industry to promote exports of pharmaceutical products, told TOI.

Pharmexcil informed the Centre that formulations ready for shipment were prepared before Covid-19 broke out and they had committed to ship the consignments to customers.

The local administration has identified areas of these positive cases for the second phase. “Total of 120 people related to the last two cases have been quarantined and samples of 78 have been sent to the lab. If anyone found to be positive will restart the process of screening in the entire area based on their location,” said Khan.

The health workers include doctors, nursing staff, aanganwadi workers along with assistance from police and home guards working round the clock in some areas. The sense of fear is so widespread that people are losing confidence. Cases of not cooperation with the health workers and hiding of health history in fear of being quarantined has surfaced in huge numbers.

“People are paranoid over the fear that health workers infected them with the disease. Secondly rumours that once the suspect is taken he/she will never come back is preventing them to cooperate with us. Sometimes one household is taking half an hour to give is the required information delaying the process,” said Subhash Goyal, a health worker screening household in Bhilwara.

Meanwhile, in many areas families have reported shortages of milk, veggies, food grains and medicines. “We have decided not to touch anything coming from outside like milk, newspaper, veggies or to entertain any person from outside to avoid exposure to virus even if we have starve,” said Akram Khan, resident of Chippa Mohalla.

Prayagraj: Taking a leaf out of the book of women agitating at New Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh area, the crowd of protesters demonstrating against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens at Mansoor Ali Park in Roshanbagh suspended the dharna on Monday in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Hundreds of local residents, most of them women, had been protesting against CAA and NRC at Mansoor Ali Park since January 12.

The residents, who protested during the night as well, removed their belongings from the park on Monday.

One of the volunteers, Sara Ahmed Siddiqui, who has been associated with the dharna since Day 1, said, “The protest has been called off in view of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) contagion. The pandemic poses a grave threat to the country. The current situation needs our immediate attention. Everyone is following precautions and as responsible citizens of the country, we too are doing the same.”

“We have been trying to tell the other protesters to call off the dharna since the past two days and they finally agreed on Monday. Once this crisis is over, we would resume our protest.”

As the protesters were evacuating the park, another group of agitators tried to reinstall tents, which had been uprooted earlier, to continue with the dharna. However, police intervened and send them back.

NAINITAL: Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Monday reserved its order on the Act giving several sops to former chief ministers after arguments in the matter were concluded.

Speaking to TOI, Kartikey Hari Gupta , the lawyer appearing for the petitioner in the case, said that the bench of Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe heard the concluding argument from both the government ’s side and the petitioner, and thereafter decided to reserve its judgment.

Dehradun-based NGO Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra (RLEK) has challenged the Act which was ratified by the state assembly in December last year. The state government had earlier brought an ordinance for the purpose, but it was soon ratified as an Act even though the case was going on in the HC and the court had reserved its order. The HC soon disposed of that petition and a new public interest litigation was filed by the same petitioner thereafter, challenging the Act.

Kavish Jain, a resident of Udaipur and a second year student of hotel management studies is one among the group to have made a video of the appeal and make it viral on social media. Kavish is pursuing hotel management from Asia Pacific Institute, Ahmadabad and was doing internship in Mauritius.

According to him, he is now trying to reach Indian authorities through Twitter and other social media platforms but there is no response yet.

Kavish’s father Sandeep Jain told TOI that his son had a return ticket for March 31 initially but when the international flights were suspended from March 22 onwards, his ticket was preponed for March 21.

When Kavish reached the airport, there was some confusion at the last moment between Air India and Air Mauritius which resulted in a problem and Kavish along with hundreds of other Indian youths from various cities in India were not allowed to board the flight despite waiting for 10 hours in the queue.

“Now, more than 400 students who are pursuing medical and many into hotel management are stuck. Many of them do not have enough money considering the high cost of living in Mauritius they are left in a peril,” Sandeep said.

Kavish who had vacated his accommodation has found a temporary one on share basis with four other youths who are stranded like him in the island country.

Sandeep who is a cloth merchant in Udaipur is reaching out to authorities seeking intervention and get back his son safely back home. Kavish’s college or the agency which facilitated him visa for the internship program too has been of no help, said his father.

PUNE: Several flyers claimed that they had to rush to the airport much before their flight timings on Monday after the city police announced ban on movement of vehicles.

Some airport-bound commuters claimed that autorickshaws charged them a bomb. In some cases, passengers were charged as much as Rs 1,000 for going to the airport from areas as close as Koregaon Park.

Twitter was flooded with flyers asking several question and queries to the airport authorities as well as the Pune police.

Alok Shrivastav (@alok_87) tweeted, “Sir (Pune commissioner of police), I have to pick up my wife from Pune airport at 12midnight. She’s traveling alone, could you kindly help? Thanks.”

Many airport-bound commuters said the sudden action was not needed and it had landed them in problems. They could have been alert and ready if the same was announced at least a day back, flyers stressed.

Some of the flyers claimed that they had no options but to cancel their tickets or ask their relatives to stay on and take an early flight on Tuesday.

Pune commissioner of police K Venkatesham said, “We are checking air travel tickets/boarding passes and are allowing people having these documents to proceed to the airport. Even otherwise, there won’t be any flight movement from tomorrow (Tuesday) onwards. Till then, taxis are being allowed to pick up and drop passengers at the airport. Travelling to railway station is out of question as all train services have been suspended.”

Joint commissioner of police Ravindra Shisave said pre-paid autorickshaws and cabs will be available for passengers at the airport. “Once a passenger approaches the kiosks and conveys his destination, one of our men will give the passenger a temporary pass stamped by police. The exercise will continue till Tuesday midnight,” he said.

Moreover, if those on way to the airport to pick up someone in their personal vehicles can convince the police with proof that they were going to pick up their relatives / friends, they will be allowed, said Shisave. “The proof can be in the form of a copy of the ticket,” he said.

Both Ola and Uber said that their services in Pune stand cancelled. “We will enable a minimal network of vehicles to support essential services,” an Ola representative said.

Salem Municipal Corporation (SMC) health department officials, who came to know that a team of 11 Indonesians had visited mosques in the city and participated in religious meetings, went to a mosque in the Sanyasikundu area near Kitchipalayam on Sunday night and made inquiries.

“We found that they had participated in religious meetings in three mosques in the Shevapet, Ponnammapet and Erumapalayam areas in the city,” S A Raman, Salem collector said. He said five people from Salem city had assisted them to reach these mosques. They had been staying in Salem since March 11.

The health department officials quarantined all the 16 people in the special ward in SGMKMCH on the same night.

Dean of the hospital Dr Balajinathan told TOI that they have collected blood samples from the 16 people. “We suspect the four Indonesians have Covid-19 symptoms and have sent their blood samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) for confirmation,” he said, adding that the results would be out in a couple of days.

The collector said fumigation was carried out in the mosques which the Indonesians visited. “We also started searching for the people who had attended those meetings and they will be quarantined at their houses at the earliest,” he added.

The collector said so far 247 people had returned to Salem from abroad since January 28, this year. “All of them were in home quarantine for nearly 14 days,” he said, adding that they were doing good.

Raman appealed to the public to inform the authorities if anybody who has come from abroad has left home quarantine. He asked them to contact 0427-2450022 and 2450023 if they come across someone who has come from abroad. “People also could reach the district administration on 1077 - the toll-free number round the clock.” He said strict action will be initiated if anyone hides one’s foreign tour details.

The collector asked SGMKMCH doctors to keep the quarantine ward ready to take up corona virus affected patients at any time. The hospital at present has a 9-bed special ward for patients along with 21 beds in the quarantine ward. A team of doctors and nurses will be in these wards round the clock. Sanitisers, one-time use pillow covers, bedsheets and other materials are also kept ready. “The government hospitals in Mettur, Attur and Omalur have five beds each to treat Covid-19 patients,” he said. Six private hospitals too have been chosen to treat Covid-19 positive patients.

It is also a breach of people’s trust.”

PUNE: State minister for food, civil supplies and consumer protection Chhagan Bhujbal said on Monday that he would not let the Pune Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) market to shut down from March 25 as it came under “essential services”.

“Closing the market will inconvenience citizens. I will speak to the Pune district authorities. A system of decentralising selling of vegetables in the APMC market could be worked out where a few traders could sell the supplies on open grounds outside such markets,” he said.

Pune APMC vegetable traders on Monday had announced to keep the vegetable market shut from March 25 to 31.

This is likely to adversely impact vegetable supplies in the city. Bhujbal told TOI, “All vegetables and fruits are essential commodities and their transportation has also been allowed. The district collector and guardian minister will talk to the traders. The same issue had cropped up in Nashik and we advised the traders to decentralise the operations to ensure that there are fewer people in the market.”

He said the trucks supplying vegetables will be given permission to transport vegetables and they will also be allowed to sell vegetables directly from trucks. Vilas Bhujbal, president, Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Traders’ and Agents’ Association, said, “Everybody is working from home, while we traders gather in larger numbers — approximately 20,000 every day.

A resident of Halol spread rumours that three persons were diagnosed with COVID-19 on Sunday. Mohammed Hanif Rathod was booked after an offence was registered against him on receiving a complaint from taluka health officer Dr Paresh Joshi. The health officer told police that he received a message on WhatsApp from a citizen informing him that Rathod was circulating misleading audio messages.

The audio clip said a couple living on Kanjri Road, who had recently returned from Bali, had been infected with another woman of the same locality. The message also said that the three positive cases had sent the administration into the panic mode. Police said Rathod had circulated this fake message to several persons on WhatsApp.

Godhra A Division police registered an offence after a man identified as Chirag Desai allegedly created a message stating that two cases were positive in Godhra. The message stated that a person in Bamroli and the wife of an automobile dealer were rushed to hospital.

Rumours also surfaced about home quarantine stickers outside several houses in Godhra. The administration had to issue a clarification on Sunday evening saying that the stickers meant that a person has to be in home quarantine and not that he or she is infected.

Godhra town has been plagued with similar rumours earlier too. In one message, miscreants had even named a person claiming that he was suffering from coronavirus infection. In another, an old grab of a television news item of a person from Godhra being suspected of suffering from coronavirus infection was circulated widely a month after the person who never suffered from the disease had gone to hospital.

183,['24/03/2020'],Pune: Vegetable &amp; fruit prices soar amid panic-buying in wake of lockdown,"Fruits and vegetables were easily available at some vendors around the Deccan area

PUNE: Panic-buying and short supply triggered a 25-50% rise in vegetable and fruit prices in various parts of the city on Monday.

Residents said potatoes and onions were being sold at Rs 50 per kg in the retail market on Monday, while tomatoes were available at Rs 40 per kg and above. Prices of the leafy vegetables recorded an increase of Rs 5-10 per bunch. “And they were not fresh either,” a resident said, adding that a bunch of coriander was being sold at Rs 20 against an usual selling price of Rs 10.

Imran, a vendor from Shivajinagar, said the wholesale market was closed for three days, which was the primary reason for less supply in the retail markets. “On Monday, we were expecting fairly good supply. However, the traders at the wholesale market told us that supply was 40% less than expected. This primarily caused the price rise. Wholesale rates were also up by 20%,” he said.

Shivajinagar resident Meena Kamate, who buys vegetables at a local vendor, said though she got what she wanted, there was very less variety in the market. “Vendors are saying that they purchased the vegetables at higher prices from the wholesalers and that’s why they were selling them at a higher rate. Also, some of the stock was not fresh as the vendors did not get fresh supply in the last three days,” she said.

The short supply prevailed in the Kothrud, NIBM Road and Vishrantwadi areas, besides Paud Road and Bavdhan. “After the Janata Curfew on Sunday, most of the shopowners preferred to buy less than their usual quota from the wholesale market,” a retailer said.

Sangeeta Kadam, a vendor from the Mandai area, said the roadside vendors kept their shops shut for the last few days. “This has created an impression that there is a shortage,” she said.

Fruits and vegetables were easily available at some vendors around the Deccan area. Even some convenience stores also started selling vegetables in the area to the benefit of the citizens. As a result, people stepping out to make purchases waited in line for their turn to buy whatever they needed.

“I stepped out to buy vegetables this morning and could get most of what I had to buy. Buying vegetables is taking slightly longer than otherwise as we have to wait for our turn but we are getting everything. The prices too have increased slightly, but I believe that is due to heavy demand,” a resident of Prabhat Road said.

A resident from the Ahmednagar Road area said fruit prices were up significantly. “I bought a watermelon at Rs 150 and Ilaichi banana at Rs 100,” the resident said.

Besides, almost half the shops in the city also downed their shutters on Monday with customers queuing outside shops, disregarding the 1-meter distance parameter of social distancing, sources from the Pune District Retail Traders’ Association said.

“Stocks were in short supply by Monday evening, with products like packet milk, bread and cigarettes being unavailable at many stores.

What irked doctors and paramedics was that many patients they saw only had minor ailments, and still decided to walk in, despite the clear advisory to them that hospitals should give priority to emergency cases alone.

A doctor said people should understand that in the times of crises, the hospital should be approached only if it is an emergency, such as heart attack, stroke, assault or accident, or if the individual is bleeding and has fallen unconscious.

“Today, we had all kinds of cases and most of them could have waited a few days,” he said. With so many crowding the registration counter, it was not possible for visitors to maintain social distancing, nor for the staff, he said.

Another doctor said some patients decided to walk-in because they were free at home, and it was a holiday. “I had a patient who has been trying to conceive for the last two years. She decided to see the doctor today as her husband was home. The patient could have easily waited a few more days if she had understood the gravity of the problem we are facing today,” the doctor said.

“A man who recently returned from Dubai walked in and wanted a test done for Covid-19. He had no symptoms and actually should have been in home-quarantine. He jumped the quarantine. What if he develops symptoms and tests positive few days later? He could’ve infected so many people, ” he said, exasperated.

Admitting that there was a problem with a high turnout of patients, medical superintendent, Noth Goa district hospital, Dr Mohandas Pednekar, said that all elective surgeries have been deferred till March 31 but OPDs would remain open.

“For a few days, people should not come to the hospital unless it is an emergency. Otherwise, the purpose of curfew will be defeated ,” he said.

He said most of their staff were able to reach in time despite public transport not being available.

“Some administrative staff did not come, but they were in called later,” he said. The district hospital saw an increase in patients as most private clinics were shut.

We started realising it after the video conference with Prime Minister on March 20 (Friday). The PM personally spoke to me and home minister Amit Shah is taking daily updates,” Sawant said.

Stepping up measures in view of the Covid-19 scare, the state government on Saturday sealed its borders to all vehicles from neighbouring states except for those carrying essential commodities.

Modi interacted with chief ministers of all states to discuss measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 during which he told them that their efforts over the next three to four weeks were crucial. Social distancing is the most important measure, the PM told the CMs.

Up until Thursday, Sawant had been reluctant to cancel the zilla panchayat elections as there was not a single case of Covid-19 detected in the state and decided instead to postpone it by two days.

This was met with a public outcry over the government’s insensitiveness in risking people’s lives and a strong rebuke from the HC hearing a PIL calling for the postponement of the polls due to the threat posed by Covid-19.

The Italian, a woman hailing from Rome, said she was trying to reach Panaji to get her visa extended, while the Israelis — two men and a woman — were trying to reach the Dabolim airport in time for their flight.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu may have recorded its first case of cluster or community transmission of Covid-19 on Monday. Officials said they did not have travel history for a 54-year-old man hospitalised in Madurai. The other two patients who tested positive on Monday, in Chennai and Tirupur, had a travel history to London. Tamil Nadu now has 12 Covid-19 positive cases.

Health minister C Vijayabaskar said the patient admitted to Rajaji Government General Hospital in Madurai had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, uncontrollable diabetes and hypertension. “He does not have any travel history. He has not travelled to any other country or any other state. We are trying to find out if he met people who have travelled abroad,” he said. Doctors treating him said his condition remains critical.

Sources in public health department said the patient had been attending functions and visited a mosque in the last few days. Health officials are tracking down his family members and those associated with him to subject them to home quarantine and collect swabs for testing.

Meanwhile, the 25-year-old who travelled from London to Chennai has been admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. His condition is stable and his relatives have been isolated, officials said.

Another 48-year-old businessman from Tirupur who also travelled from London flew into the Chennai International Airport on March 15. He came to Tirupur Government Hospital on March 16 with symptoms. Samples tested in Coimbatore showed he was positive. Tirupur public health department has now transported his family members, his car driver and maid to Coimbatore Medical College Hospital for testing.

Vijayabaskar urged people who have been put under quarantine to remain at home. “It is not a request. It is an order. That is the only way we can stop community spread,” he said.

On Monday, the number of people under home isolation went up to 89 from 54 on Sunday and the number of people in home quarantine – either because they travelled from Covid-19-hit countries or came in contact with corona positive people – went up to 12,519. “There are no flights but the number of people who have travelled with positive patients on trains and buses are now rapidly increasing,” said a senior public health officials.

LUCKNOW: Two Lucknow-based institutes under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research have began manufacturing sanitisers for the public and for people working in essential services.

The National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) has made an alcohol-based, herbal hand sanitiser that has been clinically tested and found to be “highly effective” against surface microbes. Its impact lasts for about 25 minutes and it prevents the skin from dehydrating, scientists said. The product, to be available commercially, will be moderately priced for common people.The other product is by the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), which will distribute sanitisers manufactured by it among people in essential services. The institute will hand over 10,000 bottles of 50ml each to the district administration by the end of the week.

In clinical trials done on the pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis, a dominant bacteria present on surfaces, NBRI scientists found their formula to be extremely effective.

The pathogen, they said, is very harmful to human skin.

Senior principal scientist at NBRI Sharad Srivastava also clarified that though the product has been developed in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak by NBRI under its CSR initiative, the institute does not claim that it is effective against coronavirus.

The sanitiser does have its advantages. The moisturising agent and essential oils it contains make its impact lasting and soothing to the skin.

NBRI had distributed samples of the product among people and received good response.

The technology has now been transferred to a Kanpur-based pharmaceutical firm. It is expected to hit the market within a week.

IITR, meanwhile, has prepared sanitisers at its centre for innovation and translational research as per WHO guidelines. The first batch will be ready by the weekend for distribution among workers in essential services and production will continue till required, said IITR director Alok Dhawan.

Two Delhi-based companies had provided the institute with support under corporate social responsibility.

“The hand-rub sanitisers have been prepared by a team headed by our scientist Parthasarthi Ramakrishnan,” said Dhawan.

The institute also plans to request the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to allow it to begin testing facilities for Covid-19.

IITR has written to the microbiology department of KGMU, also a nodal agency of ICMR, to train three scientists of the institute in the testing technique.

“After training, we will ask ICMR to recognise IITR as a testing centre and provide kits required for the purpose,” he added.

IITR has issued strict instructions to ensure safety at the institute. Hand sanitisers are kept at the entry points of all departments and offices, entry of outsiders has been restricted, awareness posters and instructions have been displayed across the campus and research groups have been divided into batches to work in shifts.

HYDERABAD: Following lockdown in the state due to Covid-19 outbreak, supply chain disruptions have left businesses in the lurch. From furniture, plastics to textiles, manufacturers and dealers say the week ahead is going to be a struggle.

“We usually dispatch products worth Rs 15-20 lakh every week. But this has stopped since the outbreak,” said Sanjiv Chanda, general manager of Inway, a company manufacturing LED signages.

He further said that consignments from other states, including Maharashtra, were also stuck. “Acrylic portion, which we import from China, hasn’t been arriving for a long time, hindering manufacturing,” he added.

Chanda said that even if the lockdown is lifted, they would not be able to meet the demand immediately because of several pending deliveries.

Plastic manufacturers too have been hit hard. President of the Telangana and Andhra Plastic Manufacturers Association (TAAPMA) Vimalesh Gupta said that the industry was looking at huge losses. “I have shut my factory in Kattedan for the lockdown period. Plastic granules, which generally come from Gujarat, are stuck in transit,” he said.

Arguing that plastics are an essential commodity and are required for packaging of milk and essential food items, Gupta said that he had been getting calls from clients since morning enquiring about his products.

Another plastic manufacturer, on condition of anonymity, said that he had stock for just two days and had asked his clients to apply for special permissions to restore the supply chain. He had also requested the government to help delay EMI payments for a few months.

Even the furniture industry in the state has come to a standstill. Vinay Gone, founder of Soft Touch Enterprises, dealers in wholesale outdoor furniture, said, “Our consignments worth about Rs 20 lakh are stuck in different parts of the country including Ghaziabad and Mumbai.” He added that with salaries and overheads to be paid in the coming week, and consignments already paid for, meeting expenses is tough.

Smaller business units and dealers are also facing the brunt of the current situation. Kalpana Mamidala, who has a cloth store in Uppal, said she has closed her store till March 31. “I just expanded the store for which I took a loan. The EMI amounts to Rs 25,000, while rent is Rs 10,000 and salaries and another expensenses amount to Rs 10,000. With our consignment from Surat stuck en route and no business, it will be tough to make ends meet.”

VADODARA: Gorwa police booked two persons for attacking a pharma assistant with knife outside his house. The incident happened when the victim had asked the duo not to beat thalis and to go back to their homes on Sunday evening.

According to police, complainant Jigar Kadiya went outside his house in Gorwa after he heard sound of several bikes passing outside his house during the janata curfew on Sunday at around 6pm and saw many of these riders also beating thalis till then.

Kadiya stopped two of the riders – Ashutosh Roka and Gapo – and asked them not to beat thalis and told them to go back to their homes. He also told them that the beating of thaalis was only for five minutes at 5 pm.

This infuriated the duo who wanted to teach Kadiya a lesson. Gapo took out a knife and charged at Kadiya with the intention of stabbing him. However, the pharma assistant tried to stop the accused with his hand and in the process cut his palm. Before, Gapo could re-attack Kadiya, the latter’s neighbour called the police control room and the duo sped off from the spot.

Kadiya was later taken to GMERS Medical College and Hospital in Gotri from where he was discharged on Sunday night. Later he lodged a complaint of causing hurt by dangerous weapon and provoking breach of peace with Gorwa police. Kadiya received a deep wound on his right hand.

NEW DELHI: With all modes of public transport shut down on Monday, the less than 1,000 buses of Delhi Transport Corporation(DTC) allowed to operate witnessed crowding during peak rush hours.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday evening announced the lockdown to ensure that the spread of Covid-19 is minimised in the capital. Earlier in the day, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had already announced that its train services will remain suspended till March 31.

Delhi government had allowed only 25% buses of the fleet to operate from Monday and due to the overcrowding witnessed on the first day of the lockdown, DTC has been now asked to operate 50% of its fleet. Around 2,000 buses are expected to operate from Tuesday.

While bus services are being continued only to help transport those involved in essential services, there was no checking on Monday as people were allowed to travel on self-declaration.

“While most people in our office have been asked to stay home, those who are in senior positions have to come to office. I don’t own a vehicle, so the only option to travel was by DTC buses,” said a central government employee who didn’t wish to be identified. “The frequency of buses was low and the ones that were arriving, already had so many commuters I felt afraid of catching an infection and waited for the next bus,” he said.

A DTC official said that there is no way it can be checked if those boarding a bus are involved in essential services. “There were quite a few government employees and those working in hospitals who travelled by buses on Monday but a very large number of commuters told our conductors that they are going to buy medicines unavailable in their area or that they are visiting a family member admitted in a hospital,” he said.

“With 50% of DTC’s fleet out on Tuesday, hopefully there would be less crowding but ideally limited services of Delhi Metro should have been continued instead of shutting down the entire network,” he said. “Metro stations have stringent access control and unlike buses and all commuters can be thoroughly checked,” he said. “Our buses are being thoroughly disinfected and our staff is also taking precautions but they are extremely afraid of ferrying so many passengers amidst the pandemic,” he said.

They said the ones who were attending to patients in the flu and fever clinic had been asked to maintain required distance from patients.“It has been brought to our notice from senior and junior resident (SR/JR) doctors of various departments that residents attending to suspected and confirmed Covid-19 patients are working without PPE gear. This exposes us to community spread of the disease,” RDA president Dr Rahul Bharat wrote in the letter to VC Prof MLB Bhatt.“We are scared of such working conditions causing emotional and psychological stress. We request you to provide PPE gear for proper functioning without any threat of infection,” the letter adds.Over 150 resident doctors, mostly students of postgraduate and super-speciality courses form the backbone of the university’s healthcare system.Dr Bharat claimed that PPE kits are not available in isolation ward as well, while masks are not being given to doctors working in flu and fever OPDs.“Ideally, all nursing/paramedical staff working in these wards and OPDs should also be given N-95 or triple-layered masks,” he said.He also claimed that residents of pulmonary, anaesthesia and cardiology OPDs were provided sanitisers on Monday after RDA’s letter reached the VC.However, KGMU authorities refuted RDA’s claim. Chief medical superintendent Prof SN Sankhwar said that PPE kits are being provided as per guidelines of Indian Council of Medical Research to those who come in direct contact of suspected and confirmed cases in the isolation ward.“As of now, 100 PPE kits are being used in the isolation ward where corona patients are admitted and in microbiology lab where tests are done. We maintain a permanent back-up of 600 PPE kits. We also have the required number of masks,” he said.Prof Sankhwar also said, “At the flu and fever clinic, all patients undergo infra-red thermal scanning done by a paramedic from a safe distance of 5 feet. Those with fever and dry cough—the signs of coronavirus—are sent to the isolation ward immediately, hence, there is no direct contact with the patient. Patients with flu, including those suspected to have swine flu, are attended to by doctors wearing masks and gloves.”",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74789086,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-371936,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-jr-docs-complain-about-protective-kits/articleshow/74783543.cms
215,['24/03/2020'],"HC saves DPS East, tells govt to decide afresh","Ahmedabad : The Delhi Public School (East) seems to have survived the Nithyananda ashram controversy as of now, as it is going to run beyond March 31 with a newly constituted management committee sans three trustees – Manjula Pooja Shroff, Hiten Vasant and Julius Christian.

The Gujarat high court on Monday quashed all decisions taken against DPS (East) by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) as well as the state government. Their decisions of cancelling the school’s affiliation, de-recognition and discontinuation of the school have been revoked by the court, said school’s advocate Dhaval Barot, who further said that the school will continue its operation with a new management committee till the authorities take a fresh decision after an inquiry.

The state government has been asked to appoint a senior officer as administrator under whose supervision the school will run till fresh decisions on affiliation by CBSE and recognition by the state government are taken under prevalent laws – Gujarat Primary Education Act and the Right to Education Act.

The CBSE had de-affiliated the school after its NOC was allegedly found forged. Following this, the state government withdrew its recognition in early December 2019. The district education officer announced that he will take over administration of the school till March 31. This happened after the school was mired in a controversy for sharing its campus with Nithyananda ashram, which faced allegations of forcibly detaining kids and making two inmates disappear.

The decisions were questioned by the parents of kids studying in the school as well as the DPS management. After hearing the case at length, Justice Biren Vaishnav found that the government has not followed any rules, did not conduct due inquiry before withdrawing recognition of the school on permanent basis. The court observed, “The order (for closure) is therefore evidently bad for not following the statutory mandate under Rule 109 of the Gujarat Primary Education Rules.” The HC has asked the state government to take a fresh decision in 16 weeks’ time.

The HC specifically said that till the authorities take fresh decision, the school will be run by a reconstituted management of DPS, but the new management will not have three of its older trustees – Shroff, Divan and Christian. The HC has also rejected state government’s request to stay its order.

Entrepreneurs must not panic and, instead, be proactive and leverage the new opportunities as they emerge. During this hour of crisis, supply chain disruptions can have significant implications on startups. This will eventually impact consumer demand for tech-related products and services,” said Ravi Narayan , CEO, T-Hub.Pointing out that start-ups are especially vulnerable to even small changes in the economic health of companies across sectors, Deepthi Ravula, CEO, WE-Hub, said startups will need to be relevant to survive in the new normal economic climate created by coronavirus by revisiting their business plans, organisational structures and focusing on virtual and online workforce.“What startups may have planned for their burn rate and also the runway will all need a relook due to the way funding scenarios and also the availability of capital is going to be when the lockdowns and economic tight hooks are loosened. This can be done by creating a focus on revenue rather than growth and ensuring liquidity in the face of any short-term demands,” Ravula said, adding that WE-Hub too has pivoted to more virtual incubation to ensure continuity and offer guidance and support to enable incubatees to make required changes.Agreeing, Narayan stressed on the need to be mindful of the situation and not underestimate Covid-19’s implications on startups, businesses and the economy. “We need to be cognizant of the fact that we need to make some important choices and decisions once we are out of the pandemic.”PM Sai Prasad, co-founder, Kal Bionics, said: “There is a collaborative feeling amongst startups that we are more vulnerable to supply chain dysfunction besides facility closures and decrease in staff productivity.

Moreover through our innovative solution people can produce alkaline water which is supposed to increase immunity. On the other hand, there are some challenges on the supply side and delay in international business opportunities. Steady cash flows is also a challenge.”Narayan said T-Hub being the epicentre of Telangana’s innovation ecosystem, is trying to innovate to be relevant to all its stakeholders.“T-Hub will provide support and guidance to entrepreneurs and help them figure out ways to maintain business continuity.

PUNE: Only those wedding ceremonies with not more than 25 people in attendance, and which were decided and planned before the outbreak of Covid-19 around March 11 will be allowed, the Pune police have said.

They will not allow weddings that will be organized now or in the near future. The hall’s owner or manager will be booked under relevant provisions of the law if there is any violation, the police added.

Joint commissioner of Pune police Ravindra Shisve cited imposition of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which bans assembly of five or more people.

He said, “Social and cultural gatherings have already been banned. People can fix their wedding after the situation returns to normal.”

The police have sought data of pre-decided weddings from marriage halls or lawns.

Alternatively, families which have planned and distributed wedding cards a long time back, can approach the concerned police station to seek permission.

“Only close relatives and a few friends will be allowed to attend such pre-decided weddings considering the social distancing requirement,” said Shisve.

He said people who will fix their weddings this week or in the near future will not be allowed to conduct ceremonies considering the prevailing situation.

“We will not allow such gatherings that are decided now,” he added.

Shisve said, “In the last few days, a few incidents have been reported from across the state wherein people infected with Covid-19 have attended wedding ceremonies, following which many people were screened or home quarantined by the medical authorities.”

The police have decided not to permit any wedding procession taken out of the wedding halls or lawns as part of rituals to offer prayers to the local/family deities.

There are more than 150 marriage halls and lawns in areas under the Pune police jurisdiction.

For the wedding ceremonies, people from far off areas travel using various modes of transportation and infected persons can spread the virus among the wedding ceremony attendees, Shisve said.

Builders and realtors have floated offers to lure prospective buyers hoping to lift buyers sentiment amid a stagnant market. Realtors expect to finalise deals in the festive season starting March 25 with Gudi Padwa and extending throughout Navratri.

Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), Indore chapter member Sandeep Shrivastav said, “It is an end-user market that would have grown but the virus effect has weighed on the sentiment. The recovery will not be on the expected lines but considering the auspicious period, deals will get finalized.”

The festive season from Gudi Padwa, Navratri and Akshaya Tritiya are considered to be auspicious occasions for purchase while many realtors also introduce new projects.

Realtor Vipul Agrawal said, “We are anticipating a recovery in real estate and people on a wait-and-watch mode will lock deals in the upcoming weeks. Many builders gave floated offers to attract buyers.”

Many builders in the city are offering a component in property registration, free club membership, cash discount and gifts among other items.

A few realtors said clearing unsold stocks in the present market will turn out to be difficult with customers preferring ready to move in and immediate possessions in new construction.

Realtors pegged most unsold inventory in high range flats above Rs 60 lakh in the city but could not ascertain the amount stuck in unsold.

Shrivastav said, “There are unsold stocks mostly in flats which is unlikely to clear so easily because customers prefer new construction over old ones despite discounts. A value of the unsold cannot be gauged because there is no register where sold or unsold products of all builders are maintained.”

In a social media appeal to religious heads, police said, “Pandemics do not care for territorial borders, castes, religions and communities. We can very well avoid its spread by adopting social distancing norms. Chief minister Pramod Sawant has extended the ‘janata curfew’ till midnight of March 25. We request all citizens, particularly priests of all religious places, to adhere to the directions and advise followers to pray at home.”

“As they say, God is everywhere and also resides in us. Please help us arrest the spread of this deadly virus. We request that devotees stay indoors, and keep themselves and their families safe. Let only essential services be performed in temples, churches, mosques and gurudwaras. Help Goa police help you,” the appeal stated.

On Wednesday, Hindus in Goa will be celebrating Gudi Padwa.

Even though Goa has not reported any confirmed case of Covid-19, the administration is taking all precautionary measures.

In view of the extended curfew, police are continuously patrolling to avoid any untoward incident in the state. Additional personnel have been deployed at the borders to prevent the entry of vehicles, except those registered in Goa.

The police are also making public announcements on loudspeakers, urging everyone to remain indoors till March 25 midnight.

The state government has imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code to avoid large gatherings in public places, and has also appealed to citizens to support the extended curfew. During the two-day curfew, the state will be under total lockdown except for government-run essential services.

PITHORAGARH: The Pithoragarh-Tanakpur national highway was yet again closed on Sunday due to landslides. This is the third time in the last one week that the road was blocked at the same location, i.e. Delhi Band, due to landslide.

The national highway has been undergoing rock cutting works for the all-weather road project,

“The road between Ghat , near Delhi Band, to Gurna, a 15 kilometre stretch, is very fragile and the rock cutting is very tough. That is why boulders fell on some places,” PL Chaudhari, assistant engineer, national highway, said. The officer said the landslide has been happening due to continuous rainfall. “This year, the volume of rain has been high, and may have been a cause for the landslide,” he added.

Absence of sanitation makes homeless highly vulnerable

PANAJI: Originally from Kerala, sexagenarian Raju Vellan has been in Goa for over 40 years and used to work as a daily wage labourer before resorting to begging. He carries a pocket-sized radio and a tiny tub of Vicks VapoRub with him everywhere he goes. “I have all the information about corona,” he says with a tinge of pride, hoping that he is validated for his awareness.“I have this if I catch a cold ,” he adds, flashing the ointment.Vellan sleeps on Panaji’s pavements like several other homeless people who beg for alms during the day and drift into slumber under the starry sky by night. He was given food by “a friend” on Sunday and is optimistic that his well-wisher will not let him go hungry in the coming days as well. His counterparts, however, are neither aware of the perils of the coronavirus nor have access to food in the wake of the extended curfew in Goa.Faucina Fernandes, originally from Maina, has been scavenging for food on the streets of Panaji for the past five years. She had no idea about the reason behind the city’s empty streets nor about the coronavirus.“I will have to starve,” Fernandes, says. “It’s okay if the people wish to stay inside for their own safety.”As measures to tackle the potential outbreak of this pandemic intensify, the homeless seem to have been overlooked. While staying safe and infection-free for the homeless is a Herculean challenge, managing to feed themselves even once a day is another battle altogether.Ramesh Rivonkar, 52, begs for food near restaurants in the Panaji market and often manages to get fed with the leftovers by customers as they exit the hotel.With eateries downing their shutters owing to the curfew, he is left to starve on the streets besides having absolutely no access to medical care or shelter.“I’ve seen people wearing masks and going about because of a new epidemic. But I didn’t know about the curfew. I don’t know how to fill my stomach,” he says.He has managed to accumulate some money from having begged last week. However, he has not been able to purchase food and water on Sunday and Monday as markets have been closed. “Even if I decide to leave the city to go to some other town, the buses are not operational,” he said, remaining hopeful that things would improve in the days to come.Lack of a home to self-quarantine and absence of sanitation make the homeless highly vulnerable. Medical superintendent at the North Goa district hospital in Mapusa, Dr Mohan Pednekar, however, says they are not at risk yet as they are not directly in the line of fire.“Most people flying into Goa from Covid-19 affected areas are being screened with thermal scanners and those with symptoms are being quarantined at the GMC,” he says.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74793158,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-94005,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/for-homeless-in-goa-corona-is-just-a-cold-but-the-big-worry-is-foodhomeless-overlooked-as-measures-to-combat-pandemic-get-stricter/articleshow/74783556.cms

“The former chief minister informed the Congress national president about how Congress MLAs were held captive in a resort in Bengaluru and the involvement of a former senior party leader, former ministers and MLAs who played key role in bringing down the government,” the Congress party release said.

Nath resigned from post of chief minister on Friday afternoon. Before handing over his resignation to Governor Lalji Tandon, the former chief minister said, Ï have not been betrayed. Betrayal has been of the people of Madhya Pradesh”

During his meeting with the Congress national president, he informed her in details about the implementation of public welfare policies and schemes undertaken in the last 15 months, the Congress party said. He told the AICC president that his government was trying to give new identity and direction to the state. The fear of Congress government’s success drove the BJP to conspire.

Kamal Nath assured Sonia Gandhi that the state unit stands united without any feeling of disappointment. The former chief minister is also state Congress president. He told the Congress national president and Madhya Pradesh party unit is ready to face every challenge and fight the BJP. We will return to power soon with renewed strength, he said.

Engaged in garment and jewellery manufacturing units and steel industries, most of the workers are living in their cramped rented houses in bustees around Malviya Nagar, Sitapura and Vishwakarma industrial areas.

“Some of the workers have been paid full for the days of the truncated month, but there are companies which have given only a partial amount promising to transfer rest of the money at the end of the month as every worker has bank accounts after demonetisation. Majority of the workers could not go to their states because of the cancellation of trains and buses,” said factory owner in Vishwakarma Industrial area.

Lakhs of these people are now living in unhealthy and unlivable conditions in a time when there is a fight for basic commodities.

“It is not rare to find four to five people sharing a single room. When they used to come to factory, there was less requirement of water, room space and electricity at their rented houses. But now they have to share everything. Also the prices of vegetables and other items have increased because of the prohibitions. Imagine their condition,” said Digvijay Dhabariya, a factory owner in Malviya Nagar Industrial area.

“All factory owners are not in good shape as cash flow problems have hit many due to cancellation of orders. Nobody likes to lose workers in these days as it is very hard to find them. All should come forward to help them ride out the difficult phase,” said Gaurav Gupta, a factory owner in Sitapura Industrial area. Couple state governments have already announced some relief to such workers and some in the industry also said they would like to join if the government proposes some relief to the workers who need help disparity in the current situation.

Some business even suggested plans to provide half of wage during the shutdown days contributed both by the employer and the state government.

AHMEDABAD: More than two years after they won a decisive battle to save their land from being acquired for the nuclear power project at Mithi Virdi in Talaja taluka, a coastal hamlet in Bhavnagar district, farmers from this village and others near it have come together to form Khedut Haat, a platform to sell organic farm produce.

After initially selling produce in Bhavnagar, these farmers are now marketing and their produce in Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot, Mumbai and plan to tap other urban markets.

Leading a group of farmers who cultivate, organize and sell organic produce is Bharat Jambucha, a farmer from Paniyali village, 4km from Mithivirdi, the epicentre of the anti-nuclear protests few years ago.

Although not registered, Jambucha, along with 40-50 farmers from five villages directly affected by the project, formed the Prakurtik Kheti Vechan Kendra (Khedut Haat), a farmers’ group that grows organic produce and sells it directly to customers. Depending on the success of the Khedut Haat, Jambucha said they aim to bring in more farmers and increase their number to 500. The organic cultivation, he said, is presently being done on 125 acres.

“The ultimate aim is to involve all 1,000 farmers who were part of the anti-nuclear movement,” he added.

In May 2017, the Union ministry of environment and forest (MoEF) informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) bench in Pune that the proposed 6,000 mega-watt (MW) nuclear plant — the first under the Indo-US civil nuclear pact of 2008 — was to be moved from the coastal district of Gujarat to Kavvada in Andhra Pradesh “on account of delay in land acquisition at Chhaya-Mithi Virdi site”.

The locals had refused to give up their land for the project, as the area is rich in vegetation and mango orchards known for the Sosiya variety.

“The plan for chemical-free farming was made in 2015-16. We got impetus after getting a favourable order from NGT in 2017. Ours is an informal group of farmers. We demonstrate to farmers how to do organic farming, how to make natural fertiliser, how to produce crops based on the customer’s requirements and how to market produce,” said Jambucha.

These producers, mostly small farmers, sell their produce at 10 locations in Ahmedabad by collaboration and direct selling. The farmers also sell using a parcel service to places like Vadodara, Mumbai and Tarapur where they have a client base. Using social media to promote their brand and by inviting clients to their orchards and farms for visits, these farmers now earn at least 50% more than earlier.

“In 2019, we first sold organic produce at Vigyan Nagri and Rupani Circle in Bhavnagar. We recently started selling at ten places in Ahmedabad and plan to tap other urban markets,” he added.

Kanji Solanki, a farmer from Kareda village in Ghogha taluka of Bhavnagar, is also part of the Khedut Haat. He said, “We have been into organic farming for five years. We grow wheat, bajra, and other vegetables on our farm. We sold it in Bhavnagar first and moved to other cities,” he stated.

Nilesh Dihora from Mithi Virdi, who owns 10 bighas of land, said, “We have mango and chickoo (sapota) orchards apart from growing grains, pulses and vegetables. We are into organic farming as it is less expensive and healthier.”

On whether being an unregistered unit was affecting their growth, Jambucha, who has trained farmers across Saurashtra, said, “Right now, only 40-50 farmers are actively participating in organic cultivation. When the number of farmers increases, we will get it registered as a cooperative or a producers’ company.”

The SIT submitted its 350-page report to government on February 19, 2020 and held 16 government officials responsible for illegally transferring the disputed land to a society.

The SIT found that the gram sabha land had been in possession of the tribal families since pre-Independence and was later fraudulently transferred to a society. Subsequently, the land exchanged hands between various societies and individuals. Thereafter, the land was transferred in the name of the two accused and resold.

Dutt and his henchmen were arrested after the massacre, while five cops were fined one month’s salary in January, 2020. A committee, headed by additional chief secretary (revenue) Renuka Kumar, set up in August 2019 to probe Krishi Sehkari Committees had found that around 6,602 acre land worth Rs 660 crore had been illegally occupied by at least seven cooperative societies in Sonbhadra and Mirzapur.

Besides, 53 vehicles were seized and 194 have been challaned by the police.”

“The order issued on Sunday read that people can go out to buy essential items such as groceries, vegetables and milk. Moreover, employees of essential services were kept out from the ambit of the order. However, anyone still found on the road without a valid reason will be dealt with strictly under the relevant sections,” Joshi said.

CM Trivendra Rawat, meanwhile, asked officials to strictly enforce the lockdown. In a message on Monday, the chief minister said that the lockdown has been put into force for the safety of people and urged residents to cooperate with authorities and remain in their homes till March 31.

248,['24/03/2020'],Coronavirus scare in Tamil Nadu: Crowd before the curfew,"Social distancing took a back seat as thousands rushed to the Koyambedu terminus to catch buses home

CHENNAI: The Koymabedu bus terminus was a nightmare on Monday. No one cared about social distancing, as thousands crowded the terminus pushing and shoving to board the few buses that were plying in their bid to leave the city before the lockdown from 6 pm on Tuesday.

There are no trains and on Monday, the state cut by half the usual 3,000 buses operated along 700-odd routes within the state. Almost all the government buses were packed and many women, children and the elderly were unable to board a bus even if they were willing to stand and travel. Men jumped into buses through the windows even before incoming passengers had got off.

“We can clearly see people are risking their lives. Even if one or two were affected by coronavirus, it will easily spread to thousands. The government is solely responsible for this. There is no way they could track patients in this chaos,” said V Prasanna,who ended up taking a taxi for Rs.6,000 to his native place (Thanjavur) after waiting at the terminus for an hour.

The situation was no different at Perungulathur and Tambaram and it took almost two hours for buses to cross Chengalpet.

To clear the rush, Tamil Nadu transport minister M R Vijayabaskar announced that 100 Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses were diverted to ply to Trichy, Villupuram, Tiruvannamalai and other districts.Buses from other districts were also told to report to Chennai to transport more people out from Chennai.

Besides, private omnibus operators were told to run all available buses from Chennai to other districts. Earlier, private operators told the government they were not willing to run buses till March 31. But they have now responded to the government’s request and started transporting people. Despite warnings, many operators charged exorbitant fares.

As for commuting in the city, no MTC buses, local trains, metro rail, autos or taxis will be allowed to ply after 6 pm on Tuesday. Movement of private vehicles within the city and to neighbouring districts of Kancheepuram, Chengalpet and Tiruvallur will be restricted to emergency trips. Checkposts would be erected to curb any movement between districts. ""We will have checkposts near Meenambakkam and Kundrathur, where Chengalpet district meets Chennai and Kancheepuram districts, respectively, to prevent movement of people between districts. However, there would not be any restrictions on movement within a district,"" a revenue official in Chengalpet district said.

Chennai district with a radius of 426 sqkm shares borders with Chengalpet, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts. The arterial roads in the city covers a distance of about 20 kilometres in all directions. Moulivakkam and Karambakkam form the borders of Kancheepuram district in the western suburbs. However, the restrictions may also be done based on police districts. Greater Chennai Police jurisdiction expands till Perungalathur in Chengalpet district, Kundrathur in Kancheepuram and Redhills at Tiruvallur district. ""It is more practical because cops would be manning these check posts,"" the official added.

In a statement, state Congress vice-president Abhay Dubey on Monday said, “The country gave total support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for applauding doctors, nursing staff and administrative officials who are fighting the Corona crisis. But our country also wants to know that apart from the ‘taali-thaali (applause-making noise with stainless steel plates)’ event, what blue-print does the government have to combat the spread of the virus?”

Dubey asked if the Centre has arranged for adequate supply of Protective Personal Equipment for health workers according to WHO guidelines. “What is the assurance of the N-95 masks? Have separate hospitals been identified for treatment of Corona patients? Has it been ascertained that other hospitals do not admit corona patients because it can affect patients undergoing treatment for other ailments in these hospitals?”

The state Congress vice-president further asked if notifications have been issued to state governments to ensure that private hospitals are taken under government supervision so that patients suffering from other diseases can be shifted there? “Has the Centre ensured that every district in the country keeps separate hospitals only for treatment of Corona positive and suspect patients? Is it not true that compared to the rest of the world, India has tested minimum number of suspect patients so far?”, Dubey asked.

He further asked if the Union government has made any arrangements for daily wagers whose livelihood is affected by the lockdown. Ïs it not true that when WHO was saying ventilators, surgical masks and other medical equipment should be kept ready, you government till March 19 was only giving orders for purchase and even hospitals like AIIMS did not have enough of these equipment? Had we been prepared in time then we would have kept all passengers arriving from foreign countries at a quarantine centre for 14 days,” Dubey said.

He added that time for the Union government to awaken and provide substantial budget and provide all equipment required to fight the epidemic.

The police department has decided not to charge commuters with any traffic penalty amid the lockdown. “People are not venturing out on the roads. And even if someone does flout any traffic rule, cops come in human contact with him or her while taking penalty. So we won’t be taking any traffic penalty during the lockdown,” said a senior police official.

JAIPUR: While the state is on lockdown mode, essential commodities including milk, grocery and medical shops are open, yet many people are still panic buying. Amid speculations that grocery stores, milk booths and vegetable mandis have exhausted, the Rajasthan Cooperative Dairy Federation on Monday clarified that they have ample supply of milk and its stock is available for Jaipur till March 31. Similarly, the supply of vegetables is uninterrupted, however curfew in a few states like Punjab can impact the fruits and vegetables’ supply in coming days.

TOI on Monday spoke to the dairy federation, Mohana Mandi market association and grocery wholesale traders to know if the panic buying and lockdown of vehicles are impacting their supply.

“We have a consumption of almost 8.25 lakh litres of milk in Jaipur per day. We have a supply of almost 16.75 lakh litres of milk per day. Our collection centres meant for Jaipur and Dausa districts are working. Thus till March 31 there is not going to be any crisis of supply,” said a senior officer of RCDF, Jaipur.

He said that people can intimate the authorities at the district collectorate, police and to the RDCF in case any milk booth is overcharging. Likewise, the supply of the grocery is uninterrupted so far in the city. However, the big stores dependent for their supply like wheat flour, millets and spices on states like Punjab are apprehensive because of the curfew in these states. “Till date, the supply is extremely good. However, nothing much can be said in advance about the coming days. We are asked by the government especially police to open the stores everyday,” said a manager of grocery chain store at Vaishali Nagar.

261,['24/03/2020'],RDTC hotel supplies food for SMS staff,"Jaipur: Hotel Teej, one of the properties of RTDC in Jaipur, has started supplying food for doctors and nurses in the SMS Hospital who are attending to the coronavirus patients.

Officials said since the medical staff are working long hours and are unable to have food from any other sources, except from home which is not possible given the tight working hours and urgency of attending to patients, this arrangement has been arranged.

“Hotel Teej is delivering food packets to the medical staff of SMS Hospital so that they don’t come across difficulties in carrying out their duty in this moment of great urgency,” said an official.

Since, the journeys of the luxury train Palace on Wheels have been cancelled due to the virus, the staff having expertise is available to cater to the needs of the medical staff, said an employee.

Besides, RTDC is also keeping its hotels ready in the event the existing government facilities for keeping the people in isolation falls short. As the cases continue to rise, the government is looking to ensure that if the number of patients surge, some of these hotels can also come in handy.

RTDC has 27 running hotels spread across the state having 802 rooms. According to sources, the medical and health department had asked for hotel Teej in Jaipur and Kajri in Udaipur.

“Currently, the government is using its own medical facilities and has also asked some private hospitals to set aside some beds for corona patients. If these facilities get filled up with patients and the government might use the hotel rooms.” A senior official said that after a few days of medication and if the patient is improving, such cases can be shifted to the hotels. “Some basic infrastructure is required which can be arranged easily for such a purpose. Even the hotel staff can be given a crash training to attend to patients. These staff will only play a supporting role even as dedicated medical staff will be present,” said the official.

As of now, there is no need but the official said that there is a potential chance that the government might require these facilities.

“The government has not ruled out the chances of cases spreading like in other countries. That is the worst fear and that’s when the hotels will play a crucial role,” said the official.

Zam Bazaar market was crowded with people eager to stock up on supplies. While many went to the chicken and fish shops, several others were busy buying sacks of rice.

""I usually don’t get people asking for sacks of rice but today we have had many customers,"" says Mohan, a trader. ""People are stocking up because they fear a shutdown."" Though social distancing is the need of the hour, none of the shoppers seemed aware of the gravity of the situation.

It was a different scenario at Kovai Pazhamudir Nilayam (KPN) on North Boag Road, T Nagar. By noon, there was a small queue of customers lining up before the entrance as the store is particular about the numbers allowed in at a time. A female employee, wearing a mask, took down names and numbers of customers, while another sprayed sanitiser onto the palms of those entering. ""We have been insisting that customers use sanitiser before they enter our stores for more than a week now,"" says Senthil Natarajan, managing director, KPN. ""We have also put in place a policy wherein only 20 people can be present in the store at a time,"" he says, adding that the protocol has been put in place across all 34 stores in Chennai.

While the store has been trying to ensure social distancing, customers do not seem to be sticking to it. Once inside, people often do not maintain distance as they rush to grab supplies. ""There has been a rush in all our stores. We have tried reassuring people that there is no need to hoard,"" says Natarajan.

At More supermarket in Thiruvanmiyur, only up to 10 customers are allowed inside at a time. ""People from our apartment complex are constantly sharing messages not to hoard supplies as the store is well stocked now,"" says Anuradha Balasubramanian, a resident of Ramaniyam Abhishek apartment complex located above the supermarket.

At Nilgiris supermarket in Madipakkam, residents poured in to stock up on essential supplies. ""We have been given orders to limit the number of customers inside the store. So far we’ve had no shortage of milk, fruits and vegetables,"" says the store manager S Alagappan.

According to the health department officials, it is estimated that there are 1,500 ventilators in the state; out of these almost half are installed in private hospitals. Since Covid-19 affects lungs badly, in many cases, high-risk patients require ventilator support along with other treatment.

A 38-year-old patient, who tested positive for Covid-19, has been shifted to MDM hospital, Jodhpur from Pali district as the only ventilator in Pali district hospital is lying defunct. Thankfully, the patient does not require ventilator support as of now.

Health minister Raghu Sharma recently expressed concern over the quality of some ventilators, which were imported from China, in government hospitals. Having it on the back of its mind, the state government is now taking measures to utilise the ventilators installed in private hospitals.

Instructions have already been issued to private hospitals (having at least 100 bed capacity) to reserve 25% beds for Covid-19 patients. “We have asked private hospitals to reserve 25% beds for Covid-19 patients,” said health minister Sharma.

Realising that critical care for Covid-19 patients needs improvement, the state government is taking all possible measures to prevent the spread of the disease so that the situation does not get worse.

When it comes to critical care in district hospitals, the situation is worrisome in all 33 districts. A senior health department official said, “In all district hospitals, collectively, we have 185 ventilators.”

The state government is banking on the Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital, Jaipur, which has highest number of beds in ICUs equipped with ventilators. The health minister has ordered to purchase 30 more ventilators for SMS Hospital.

The doctors are facing shortage of masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) needed in treatment of Covid-19. The state government has sought help of private hospitals in this regard. At a meeting of private hospitals’ representatives with the health department officials, it was reported that PPE was not available in the market.

“We are ready to help the state government against Covid-19 but we require safety for ourselves too. We remain at high risk of getting infected while providing treatment to patients. PPE is not available for us, without which we are at risk of getting infected,” said Dr Vijay Kapoor, secretary, private hospitals and nursing homes society.

Also, private hospitals have written to the state health department that they need PPE, which are not available in the market now.

The education department is said to have proposed this move on Monday evening in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

As rumours about the cancellation of exams were rife on Monday evening, education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama cleared air and said, “We are seriously considering the move because we are facing pressure from various corners.

A section of decision makers are of the opinion that the examinations could be postponed and it is not advisable to cancel them. More than 70 lakh students will be affected by the decision across 55,000 schools.

If the exams are cancelled, this will be the fourth time in half a century when students in the state will got mass promotions.

All the MLAs present in the meeting unanimously supported Chouhan's name through a voice vote.

Soon after Chouhan was elected as chief minister, Bhargava also resigned as leader of opposition.

Two central BJP observers, Arun Singh and Vinay Sahasrabuddhe supervised the meeting proceedings. Sahasrabuddhe was monitoring the meeting through video conferencing. He could not reach Bhopal due to the corona virus scare. At the meeting, the MLAs were provided with the masks and sanitizers.

BJP state chief VD Sharma said that almost all MLAs took part in the meeting and only those legislators who are hail from far-off places like Rewa, Singrauli, Sidhi and Gwalior couldn’t attend. He said BJP president JP Nadda had instructed to ensure no crowding takes place during the meeting therefore, only MLAs were allowed inside without their assistants or security guards.

During the meeting Chouhan also addressed the MLAS and made a scathing attack on the outgoing Congress government, claiming it had destroyed the state during 15 months in power.

""With collective efforts, we will put the state back on track of development and public welfare, but I wish to urge all colleagues that it isn't a time for celebration and coronavirus is the topmost priority,"" he said. “I would start sitting in my office in Mantralaya since Monday night.""

Chouhan, who was touted to be BJP’s choice for the hot seat again had to face stiff challenge from senior leaders like Narendra Singh Tomar, Thawar Chand Gehlot and Narottam Mishra.

Several other names were doing the rounds. However, the party leadership finalised Chouhan’s name.

CHENNAI: The state lockdown set to begin from Tuesday evening is likely to hit construction of Chennai Metro Rail’s 9km phase-1 extension from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar. Operations on the line were expected to begin by mid-2020. CMRL officials said more than 80% of the workers will not be turning up for work during the lockdown from Tuesday till March 31, which is likely to delay the project.

A metro rail official said except for some critical work in the underground section and in the cut and cover that links the underground tunnels with the elevated corridor, work may come to a halt in the rest of the stretch. More than 1,000 workers are engaged to work on the line.

“We have instructed workers to stay home. So, workers will be present only to remove water from the tunnels and finish the civil work in the cut and cover section. The safety of our workers is more important to us now than the project,” a metro rail official said. “There will be another round of discussions on Tuesday. We are monitoring the health of our workers.” The stretch from Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar has eight stations, including two under ground.

On Monday, the chief minister announced that the state will be under lockdown from 6pm on Tuesday till March 31, following the Centre recommending it to prevent spread of Covid-19. Section 144 of the CrPc will be in force to prevent people from gathering in any place.

The outbreak of Covid-19 in China and many European countries had already delayed the project by two months as electrical equipment, elevators and other parts required for installation of systems like platform screendoors are imported.

The line, which was planned to be opened in June 2020, faced the first hurdle when CMRL had to terminate contract with IL&FS Transportation Networks Limited over delay in completion of underground stations at Sir Theagaraya College and Korukkupet.

Earlier this month, officials operated a motorised trolley along the 9km stretch to check the track alignment. They had planned to conduct trial runs by operating a diesel locomotive in April followed by metro trains late next month or in May.

283,['24/03/2020'],Those flouting lockdown to face arrest,"Bhubaneswar: The commissionerate police have decided to arrest those who are found on the streets in violation of the ongoing lockdown in the twin cities of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack to contain the spread of coronavirus. The zero tolerance is being adopted in the wake of large-scale violation of the week-long lockdown that started on Sunday.

“We faced problems as a number of people came out on the streets by defying the lockdown diktat. We have decided to issue vehicle passes only to those persons or employees who are involved in the delivery of essential and emergency services in the twin cities. They should stick the passes on their vehicles so that our personnel will not stop them, thereby preventing contacts between people and police,” commissioner of police Sudhanshu Sarangi said.

Police said emergency service providers should collect the passes from local police stations by Tuesday evening. “We will start making arrests from Wednesday. The (non-pass holders) will not be allowed to move on the streets with their vehicles. We appeal to people to obey the government’s lockdown order or face music,” Sarangi said.

Sources said the state police headquarters is also likely to adopt a tough stance against the lockdown violators in other districts and issue an advisory to the superintendents of police in a day or two. Police said the violators would be booked under Sections 188 (disobedience of government order), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease and dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease) and 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule) of the Indian Penal Code.

The Bhadrak district police on Monday arrested a trader for opening his non-essential shop in violation of the lockdown order. A large number of people were also fined for coming out on the roads in Bhadrak.

In a related development, the commissionerate police are regularly calling up senior citizens in the twin cities and requesting them to stay indoors. “We have senior citizen security cells in police stations. The nodal officers of the cells are in touch with the elderly in their localities,” additional commissioner of police Anup Kumar Sahoo said.

284,['24/03/2020'],From RSS swayamsevak to BJP’s face in MP,"Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan with his family on Monday

Bhopal: For the new chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan life has come a full circle. Shivraj’s transformation from “paon, paon wale bhaiya” to ‘Mama’ and the tallest leader in the state has been phenomenal.

Born to a family of famers in Jait village in Sehore, he began his political journey from a modest background as an Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) volunteer, he rose to become the BJP’s face in MP and a. Being the chief minister of the state for over 13 years, he took over again on Monday for a record fourth time as chief minister. A record even his staunch critics envy.

As a five-time Member of Parliament, Shivraj was known to be energetic leader with a mass connect particularly in the rural areas. He mostly traveled on foot for long distances and even on bicycle that earned him the title of ‘paon, paon wale bhaiya’. He represented the Vidisha Lok Sabha seat preceding the BJP icon and one of the founder members of BJP late Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

After taking over as chief minister of the state for the first time from veteran leader late Babulal Gaur in 2005, Shivraj initiated a slew of welfare measures including for girl child and women that was replicated by the Centre. His flagship programme Ladli Laxmi Yojna earned him national repute and the tag of Mama (maternal uncle).

He later started the Mukhya Mantri Kanyadan Yojna that facilitated mass marriage of girls at government cost and the famous Mukhya Mantri Teerth Darshan Yojna allowing the elderly to visit holy places across the country by rail on state’s cost.

His bicycle scheme for schoolchildren, Re 1 per kg rice and Rs 2 per kg wheat schemes and the Sambal Yojna offering electricity at Rs 200 per month to poor were among the other famous welfare schemes.

After the loss in 2018 assembly election, Shivraj’s clout appeared to be waning as he was not named the leader of opposition in the state assembly but was drafted in the organisation as BJP national general secretary.

But, never wanting to leave Madhya Pradesh politics, Shivraj kept his eyes on the state and the developments.

He emerged a pivotal figure in the recent political developments and seized the opportunity by being on the right side of Jyotiraditya Scindia and the rebel MLAs and leading charge against the Kamal Nath government and holding on to the BJP MLAs.

Unless the construction work completes, we can’t leave,” said Raju, who is working at a site in Chandanagar. He said he was aware of the virus, but added quickly that there was no way they could follow social distancing as their activity involved team work.“We all work together and stay in a cramped place.

He claimed that AMC and the state government has currently made provisions for temporary isolation of up to 10,000 individuals in the city which can be scaled up to 20,000, but higher numbers will be difficult to handle.

Highlighting the seriousness of the issue and the importance of the partial lockdown, Nehra said, “Even if 2% to 5% of the 80-lakh population of the city gets affected by the virus our system will be in great difficulty as then the numbers of those affected will surge into lakhs,” Nehra said. He has appealed to citizens not to send out children to play in public areas, and that the elderly should avoid morning walks for some time. Nehra also advised that those venturing out for household provisions should do that only once in three days.

Nehra said that social distancing will be the key to curbing the spread of the virus over the next two months. Senior AMC officials claimed that the administration has already ventured into a phase where maximum efforts are required to slow down the virus’s penetration into the local community. “We are at war and if we break the present security cycle of partial lockdown Covid-19 will have an advantage over us,” Nehra reiterated.

He said the AMC with its staff has begun conducting door-to-door surveys. “We have begun spraying disinfectants in public areas and will soon reach out to other areas the way it is being done in China, European countries and US and other such countries. But all these efforts will fail if people still loiter around and hang out at crossroads without any business. ,” Nehra said.

“Milk is an essential commodity and the government has not put any restriction on the opening of booths. Still, many booths were closed,” said Hemant Kumar Sahu, a BDA employee.

According to the guidelines, all Omfed booths will operate during the lockdown but can’t sell anything other than milk and milk products. “We are facing huge losses due to restriction on sale of other eatables in Omfed booths. The number of customers has also gone down,” said Prasant Sahu, owner of an Omfed booth in Unit-IV area.

Meanwhile, milk farmers and cooperative societies in several areas alleged that Omfed did not collect milk from them on Sunday and Monday morning. They alleged that the government did not give them any prior notice regarding cancellation of collection of milk from them. “We sell around 100 litres of milk to Omfed every day but the procurement vehicle did not come for the past two days,” said Gourang Rout, member of a cooperative society in Mundilo in Jagatsinghpur district.

MD of Omfed, Raghu R Prasad, said, “The daily market demand of milk sold by Omfed has drastically reduced from 5.5 lakh litre per day to around 2 lakh litre per day. Omfed dairy plants have 10 lakh litres in their silos. So procurement of milk by Omfed will be based on the market demand.”

288,['24/03/2020'],"Coronavirus scare: Chennai hospital to deploy robots to deliver food, medicines in wards","Doctors and nurses will continue to work in wards; robots will be sent in for non-medical needs

CHENNAI: Soon, robots will deliver food, beverages, and tablets to Covid-19 positive patients in the isolation ward of Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital here. They will carry monitors and cameras to aid video conferencing between patients and care givers.

A private university that developed the technology will organise a demo for doctors and paramedical staff after which they will deploy the robots. “The aim is to reduce frequent exposure for health staff and limit the number of people entering the ward,” said dean Dr J Jayanthi.

While doctors and nurses will continue their rounds and duties in the wards, the robots will be sent in for nonmedical needs. Studies show that the virus can stay alive on steel for three days and cardboard for up to 24 hours. Such machines are being used in several countries as frontline workers. For instance, in China a machine that has a robotic arm on wheels performs ultrasound scans, takes mouth swabs and listens to sounds made by a patient’s organs. Some others clean surfaces with disinfectants and hand over hand sanitisers.

Last week, the hospital, which sees 80,000 footfalls a day, shut all private canteens and eateries, restricted visitors and outpatients, and advised doctors to postpone elective surgeries. The pharmacy will also give 30 days supply of drugs, instead of the usual one week, to patients with chronic ailments.

The GH has also opened the ground floor Tower 3 block as a Covid-19 outpatient ward. “We decided not to wait for the inauguration. Having a separate unit will prevent people with symptoms entering the main hospital,” said health minster C Vijayabaskar. At least 150 beds have been set aside in six of the eight floors in the rheumatology block.

Meanwhile, a pulmonology block is now getting converted into 30-bed isolation unit that will satisfy international standards.

JAIPUR/NEW DELHI: The Rajasthan government on Monday decided to ban all private vehicles on road from 6 am on Tuesday barring vehicles related to essential services including medical, paramedical, vegetables, fruits and grocery till March 31. The decision was taken after people were seen flouting ‘janata curfew’ risking their lives in the time of Covid-19 infection. The state highway tolls would also be closed for operations of private vehicles except those used in transportation of essential commodities. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot warned that if public does not cooperate in maintaining the lockdown, government will have to impose a curfew from Wednesday.

Gehlot also announced a Rs 2,000 crore relief package for 1.41 crore families to meet their daily needs in the wake of the lockdown. Those not covered under any social security pension scheme will be given an ex gratia of Rs 1,000. The CM instructed to release two month’s pension to 78 lakh beneficiaries.

Apart from this, Rs 1,000 ex gratia will be given to the each of the 36.51 lakh BPL families, 25 lakh construction workers and registered street vendors who are not covered under the social security pension scheme. Gehlot said in a statement that the decision will benefit 1.41 crore families in the state.

He said the state government will not allow any shortage of funds and resources in this hour of crisis.

During the lockdown, no needy will face any trouble and no person will sleep hungry, he said, adding that food will be delivered to the needy with the help of voluntary organisations and donors.

The state government will also distribute ration packets to the needy, who are not included in the National Food Security Act list. This will include items of need such as flour, pulses, rice, oil etc. These packets will be made available at every government building, police station, tehsil and panchayat building in urban and rural areas, he added.

Gehlot at a high-level meeting directed the authorities to ensure full compliance of the order.

Gehlot, upset with people for making a mockery of the ‘janata curfew’ said, “I appeal that people should not come out of their houses and observe self-imposed curfew for their as well as others’ safety. If people will not cooperate, the government would be left with no option other than imposing curfew from Wednesday onwards,” he said.

It was on Monday that the Union aviation ministry decided to stop domestic flights from Wednesday. In the current situation, the staff working on ground are feeling scared of getting infected by coronavirus.Around 100 to 200 persons are engaged in duties at airport that includes staff from the private aircraft carriers. Some of the crew members who spoke to TOI without revealing their identity said that despite high risk of contracting infections they have to report for duty Even the cabin crew of private carriers are worried over increasing threat of Covid-19, which according to them spread due to international flyers arriving in India.According to them, the private companies would sack them immediately if the flights were grounded. They didn’t want to lose their jobs at this juncture due to the slump in employment.Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Raj Thackeray has also raised concerns over continuance of domestic flights when other important services like railways, bus and local trains were stopped. According to him, he had spoken to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in this regard.A senior official told TOI that he didn’t understand the logic behind operating flights despite losses. “Yesterday’s Air India flight from Delhi which was routed through Bhopal had only 41 passengers. Today’s flight of the national carrier from Delhi that was routed through Raipur had only 25 flyers. For the sake of just few passengers there’s no point in risking lives of the ground staff,” he said.Another aggrieved employee from a private carrier said the government was risking lives of thousands like them working at various airports. “The virus was brought by those arriving from abroad. We are at big risk being the first persons interacting with them at the airport. Had the government stopped flights from abroad last week, the infected passengers wouldn’t have arrived in India and risked the entire population,” she said.Partially agreeing with the grievances of aggrieved employees, Mihan India Limited (MIL) director Abid Ruhi said that even MIL employees were at risk. “We are taking due care by providing them masks, hand gloves and sanitisers. Even team of doctors and counsellors from the public health department, who check and counsel the passengers, are at risk. However, this is national duty and we all need to follow the government’s instructions,” he said.Adding that the government had suspended domestic flights from Wednesday, he informed that at a time about 100-200 employees from Central India Security Force (CISF), MIL, housekeeping and other departments work at the city’s airport.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74790327,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-200856,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-airport-ground-staff-fear-contracting-dreaded-covid-19-infection-job-worry-for-cabin-crew-after-flights-stop/articleshow/74783079.cms
292,['24/03/2020'],Curfew in Nagpur: Do not step out of your homes,"<p>Representative image<br></p>

NAGPUR: City police, making their no-nonsense approach clear, hit the streets on Monday evening shortly after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray imposed a curfew in the backdrop of 89 persons testing positive for Covid-19 and two deaths in Maharashtra. State home minister Anil Deshmukh warned of strict action against violators.

With section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) already in force, the latest order imposing curfew will pave the way for stringent police action. Specifically, the state has now prohibited assembly of five or more persons, and also imposed restrictions on movement of vehicles, private as well as public, and sealing of the borders.

With the arrival of the official letter from the state chief secretary declaring the lockdown, city police chief BK Upadhyay issued orders reiterating the clause of prohibiting any private vehicles on the roads from Tuesday onwards till March 31, and other restrictions barring essential and emergency services. Private vehicles can now ply only with permission or police pass from nearest police station, and any violation would lead to seizure and penal action.

Home minister Deshmukh said state borders have been sealed and movement of private vehicles has been restricted. “Home quarantined persons will face strict action now if they violate orders. Citizens are requested to follow government orders and cooperate with police and administration,” he said.

CP Upadhyay said citizens are expected to visit police stations and procure vehicle pass if they want to use private transport. “Until it’s a genuine emergency or transport of essential commodities like vegetable, medicines and such exempted materials, police would not allow any one on the streets. One can walk to get vegetables and medicines. Government and media personnel must travel with I-cards to avoid inconvenience,” he said.

“We will seize vehicles and take action if anyone is found on the road without an emergency,” said the top cop. “Police had allowed liberty to exempted medical and essential services, and citizens have started misusing them grossly even in this hour of national threat of a pandemic disease,” he said.

District collector Ravindra Thakare appealed for cooperation from citizens to stop ‘Italy’ or ‘Spain’ like situation in Nagpur.

Earlier in the day, TOI observed rather slack enforcement of section 144 CrPC in the city, especially in slums. TOI witnessed residents gathering at chowks in Vandevi Nagar, Gulshan Nagar , Itabhatti, Bharatwada, Punapur, Pardi, Bhandewadi, Hiwri Nagar, Futala Vasti and some other places, ignoring police presence in the vicinity. The cops too seemed to have spent the day ignoring loitering public on the streets, and steady flow of private vehicles, autorickshaws and erickshaws with passengers.

With grocery and diary outlets being exempted, these shops remained crowded most part of the day with cops and traders ignoring social distancing and such measures. Several shops and roads at Jaripatka remained abuzz with residents. Cops, despite being deployed at Vasant Shah Chowk at Jaripatka Market, ignored the mob in front of a closed garment shop. Similar situation was observed at Nandanvan and Jagnade Chowk, with slack enforcement leading to sporadic groups at different places.

Through the day, police took action against 28 persons for violating orders, detained 18 for keeping shops open, and also challaned 192 persons at nakabandi points.

Zonal DCP Neelotpal admitted violations by some in Jaripatka and other localities, saying citizens had been misusing the exemption allowed. “People were misleading cops that they were going for medical, essential services or emergencies, when they were not. On many occasions, police caught their lies and penalized them. But it is insensitive and pathetic moral behaviour when the nation is reeling under a threat,” he said. “Tomorrow, we will deal with such issues with strict action,” he said.

The silver lining in the cloud were efforts by cops to help stranded citizens reach railway station and bus depots from different places. Citizens, individually and in groups, also offered cops on deployment refreshments throughout the day.

TOI also found a sober mood at Kalamna’s fruit and vegetable market earlier in the day. “As the borders are sealed, many vegetables and fruits may find it difficult to reach, creating a short supply,” said a trader. Similarly, Cotton Market too traders too were a dejected lot, unsure of receiving supplies from Kalamna.

With prohibition on movement of transport and railways, the Ganeshpeth inter-district bus stop and Manas Chowk’s inter-state bus depot wore a deserted look. Similarly, the entire premises of the Nagpur railway station were deserted.

The industries at Hingna, MIDC and Butibori were almost closed, with the district administration extending permission to a textile company time till March 24 to wrap up production. Police and district administration had received some complaints of some organizations functioning.

CHENNAI: “I am scared and want to go home,"" said Tanushree, a migrant worker who came to the city from Kerala to take a train to West Bengal. But she and her husband could not board the connecting train from MGR Central as by the time they arrived, all trains had been cancelled.

Now, Tanushree has a shelter but she is the only woman among 100 men in a community hall provided by the corporation.

As more workers arrived at the railway station looking for trains, the corporation and the labour department opened more shelters to house them till train services resume. On Monday, more workers landed at the Central station only to be turned away. And a few more reached on a Danapur-Bengaluru train in the afternoon.

From Sunday night, special vehicles were placed outside the station to receive and move stranded migrant workers. The aim was to offer them shelter rather than allowing them to sleep on the pavements and on the station campus, said an RPF official.

However, the shelters are just open halls where the workers sleep on bedsheets spread on the floor and use their bags as pillows. Similar was the scene at a community hall in Chintadripet.

""I’m more worried about my health than security. We were sent from Kerala because of the virus outbreak, but I feel people are not that serious here,"" Tanushree said.

Other workers at the shelter had similar concerns. ""We need safety masks first,"" said Mahinder Chanda, one of the workers residing at the shelter. ""There are only two bathrooms for 125 people. We hear that more will be moving in here in the coming days, they need to make adequate arrangements,"" he said.

Many worked in hotels, factories or at construction sites. Naseem, a worker from Odisha, went to the station on Monday morning but in vain. ""I am unable to stay still at this time. I need to go home,"" he said.

Corporation officials said the shelters may allow adequate social distancing to prevent the spread of any infection.

""However, they are less crammed in a hall compared to a station. We are providing them hygienic food three times a day from Amma canteens,"" an official said.

Faced with a lockdown and such crisis, the corporation has also activated its disaster relief module from Sunday with top officials in charge of each zone. Every chief engineer and deputy commissioners are nodal officers for each zone and have to supervise disinfection in the area.

Doctors will bring the blood stem cells of an 18-year-old student of St Teresa’s College from Kochi. A DATRI staff, who is confirmed infection-free, will be ferrying the cells from AIMS hospital in Kochi to a city hospital by road . “We have taken special government permission for this as there is no other means of transportation available. The ride will take us about 12 hours. Doctors have told us that we can’t postpone this because of the recepient ’s medical condition ,” DATRI head of operations Sethukarasi said.

Stem cell transplantation is a standard treatment for blood cancer, thalassemia and other fatal blood disorders. The teen registered for donation on October 29 during a recruitment camp held by DATRI in association with NGO SmileMakers. Potential stem cell donors are in the 18-50 years age group. Swabs from the volunteer’s cheeks are collected and sent to a laboratory for HLA typing. “In just a few months, DATRI found a match for the teen’s stem cells. Her family has also agreed to the cause and is fully supportive of the donation that is taking place tomorrow,” she said.

The DATRI team is taking all precautions to ensure safety of the donor when she visits the hospital for donation. DATRI, which has over four lakh donors on its list completed 710 blood stem donations in February, a release said.

The district administration has arranged for at least 40 buses for their smooth journey as all government and private passenger buses have suspended their operation owing to the lockdown in the district.

Earlier in the day, about 250 migrant workers had reached the station by train. The district administration had arranged for five buses to drop them to their respective villages.

“During the screening, nine of them were found to have developed flu-like symptoms. They were taken to the MKCG Medical College and Hospital here for final screening,” R Jagadeesh Patnaik, the chief district medical officer, said. He added that at least eight teams of doctors and paramedical staff have been engaged for the screening of the migrant workers at the railway station. “They were treated at the corona outdoor patients’ ward and put under observation.

Even the Junior Doctors’ Association (JDA) of Vimsar has written to the government to provide sufficient number of masks to the medical and paramedical staff of the premier healthcare institution of western Odisha.

JDA president Sanjeeb Mishra said, as per the WHO recommendation, the healthcare providers who are taking care of Covid-19 suspects should wear personal protective gear such as masks. “In such a scenario, many cough and cold patients visiting the different OPDs in Vimsar may also be suspected of having contracted the virus. Therefore, all the healthcare providers engaged in the healthcare institutions should be provided with face masks. However, the medical and paramedical staff of Vimsar are not getting the required number of masks here,” he added.

Officials said earlier the hospital would require around 5,000 face masks per month. However, the hospital now requires around 1,000 face masks every day. Considering the increasing requirement, the Vimsar authorities had asked the Odisha State Medical Corporation Limited (OSMCL) to supply one lakh face masks eight days ago. But they are yet to receive the masks. Moreover, the OSMCL has also intimated the Vimsar authorities that it would supply only 4,000 face masks in the first phase and subsequently, the OSMCL would supply 2,000 face masks per week.

As of Monday, there was a stock of only around 2,500 face masks in the hospital store. Owing to the shortage, the hospital authorities are now providing masks to the medical and paramedical staff working at the three dedicated Covod-19 OPDs and casualty only. However, the staff working in other departments are not being provided with masks.

Jayashree Dora, the superintendent of the premier healthcare centre, also admitted that there is a shortage in supply of the masks to the hospital. She hoped that the government would supply the adequate number of masks soon.

Considering the statistical reports, such facilities must also be set up in other places in Vidarbha . We direct the state to take necessary steps for creation of these facilities within two weeks.”While hearing a plea by CH Sharma and others regarding inadequate facilities at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH), where Anup Gilda was appointed amicus curiae, the HC adjourned hearing till April 7. It was clubbed with another PIL by businessman Subhash Zanwar through counsel Ram Heda.After it was pointed out that there was a lack of isolation wards in Central Jail here, the bench asked the government to make arrangements for setting up the facility across all prisons in Vidarbha in a week. “We also direct the state to ensure thermal screening of all passengers arriving on domestic flights at Nagpur airport until the situation improves.”Acknowledging that Covid-19 could spread alarmingly after crossing second stage, the judges advised authorities and citizens to take care and exercise prevention. “One of the steps could be enforcing social distancing. The police commissioner and collector have already prohibited assembly of five persons. However, such orders wouldn’t be enough. Both need to consider if movement of even a single person and vehicle on public roads/places could be prohibited, which would go a long way in preventing community spread.”Earlier, senior counsel Jugalkishor Gilda pointed out that the centre hasn’t granted approval to any private laboratory to test coronavirus swab samples.Quoting Dhruv Laboratory, which is equipped with Covid-19 testing kit, he said the tests conducted by private laboratories are costly at about Rs9,000, but those who can afford should be diverted there to reduce the burden on government facilities. “We direct Centre and state to consider granting approval and registration to private laboratories across Maharashtra which fulfil norms, within a week,” the judges said.On a news report that a suspected woman patient from Hindustan Colony was turned away by GMC authorities since she had no history of foreign travel, the HC directed respondents to verify the case and take action.WHAT HC SAID* Satisfied with steps by authorities to contain Covid-19 virus* Welcome step to provide internet kit to MLA Hostel inmates* Ensure adequate supply of Hazmat Kits for protection of doctors, nurses* Also provide such kits to health workers at MLA Hostel in a week* Centre, state to coordinate with NIV to procure patient testing kits* Explore whether GMCH, IGGMCH staff treating patients could stay in hospitals* Centre to introduce approved Indian kits in market for testing purpose* Centre to seek feasibility report from NIV on testing kit developed by IIT",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74789618,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1094538,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/set-up-testing-facilities-at-yavatmal-chandrapur-gadchiroli-hc/articleshow/74783125.cms
311,['24/03/2020'],Silence during janta curfew draws 'leopard' to Meerut outskirts,"MEERUT: A leopard spotted prowling near Gagol village, 8 km from Meerut city, instantly dissipated fear of coronavirus among its residents on Sunday. A forest department team, which is still trying to trace the big cat, believes the “silence owing to self-imposed janata curfew” may have attracted the feline to the area.The big cat was seen near a milk processing plant at Gagol village, adjacent to Partapur airstrip. Four men in a car spotted the cat while they were passing by around midnight. The nearest forest is Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary , about 40 km from the village. It is suspected that it might have followed the Kali Nadi to reach the village.“The possibility cannot be ruled out as there is subdued human activity because of janata curfew though we could not find any trace of the animal whatsoever. It could be a fishing cat, which is slightly smaller in size than a leopard. We have deployed our team in the region nonetheless,” said divisional forest officer Aditi Sharma, who visited the spot on Sunday.According to forest ranger, Rithani, Naresh Kumar, “The CCTV footages of the milk plant show a car stopping in the middle of the night but the leopard was not caught on camera. I along with my team was there on Monday and we are patrolling the area. There is a high probability that the cat crossed the airstrip and moved over to the other side which is a forested area.”A resident of Gagol village Rajpal Singh said, “Ever since the leopard was spotted, there is considerable panic among the people in the area. People here have forgotten corona scare at the moment. Hope the big cat has left the region.”In February 23, 2014, Meerut witnessed the worst leopard scare till date when a big cat strayed into the Cantonment Hospital situated in the heart of the city. It had resulted in a complete shutdown for a couple of days.",meerut,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/silence-during-janata-curfew-draws-leopard-to-meerut-outskirts/articleshow/74782207.cms

Post the outbreak of Covid-19, there has been a considerable decline in crime rate. There is a decrease in property offences, as most people are at home. Street crime too has come down, as very few people have ventured out since Sunday,” Pimpri Chinchwad’s assistant commissioner of police (crime) Shridhar Jadhav told TOI.“About two weeks ago, we were registering over 25 FIRs each day. Now the number has reduced to 12 per day. Police presence on the roads is also one of the main reasons for decline in the crime rate,” Jadhav added.Pune too witnessed a considerable dip in reported crimes.“The city police have registered fewer house break-in and vehicle-theft cases. People are at home and their vehicles are not on the roads, affecting these two types of crime,” Pune’s additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale said.The city police started receiving fewer complaints since March 18 (21 FIRs) and since then, the trend is of a continuous decline. The police registered 18 FIRs each on March 19 and 20. The number of FIRs reduced further on March 21 to 11. On March 22, the police registered 10 complaints, while on the day of the ‘Janata Curfew’, police registered only three FIRs.“Many people are following the work-from-home policy, which has contributed to a lower number of vehicles at public parking spaces or on public roads. This has further reflected in fewer crimes like burglaries and vehicle thefts,” Morale added.On a daily basis, the police register six to nine cases of burglaries, he said and added, “There is a decline in the number of minor body offences as there are fewer people are on the road.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74784712,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-165132,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-19-outbreak-no-fir-in-pimpri-chinchwad-for-two-days-pune-crime-dips/articleshow/74783121.cms

MEERUT: A group of 22 workers — returning home from Mumbai after they were rendered jobless in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown in the metropolis — met with an accident after the pick-up truck they had hired for their travel turned turtle late night on Sunday.

The accident happened between villages Chittora and Kawal in Jansath region of Muzaffarnagar. They had taken the Dehradun Express from Mumbai, and had alighted from it at Muzaffarnagar on Sunday afternoon.

According to police sources, 18 of the labourers were badly injured and had to be admitted to district hospital. Most of them were residents of Bijnor. According to Mohd Alam, one of the victims, “We are all dead tired and had dozed off, when all of a sudden there was a massive blast and the truck lost balance. It all happened within seconds.”

Jansath police station in-charge Yogesh Verma told TOI, “The accident occurred after a tyre burst. All are residents of Bijnor district . They were immediately taken to hospital. No FIR was lodged.”

314,['24/03/2020'],Covid-19 scare: Anti-encroachment drive spike prices of vegetables in Nagpur,"NAGPUR: Even though supply of vegetables continued from smaller towns in the district and adjoining states, prices of most vegetables have shot up in retail markets due to the lockdown in the wake of coronavirus outbreak.Due to poor demand, wholesale fruit market in Kalamna will not operate till March 31.“There is dearth of supply of vegetables in Nagpur city. Apart from Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh and Telangana , vegetables from Saoner, Ramtek, Hingna, Umred, Khapa, Patansawangi, Kalmeshwar, Katol etc are being transported to the city’s wholesale market in Kalamna,” agriculture produce market committee president Nandkishore Gour told TOI.“Prices of perishables have increased as roadside vendors have been stopped from selling vegetables,” admitted a vendor from Gokulpeth Market, Shriram Wagle.Most vegetables including potatoes, onions, tomatoes etc are being sold at double the price in retail as compared to wholesale market.TOI visited a couple of markets and found potatoes, onions, tomatoes were being sold at Rs30, Rs40 and Rs20 a kg, respectively, at retail markets, while the wholesale rate is almost half.Vegetable prices, in fact, have risen significantly during the last couple of days. Prices of bitter gourd, for example, rose from Rs30 a kg to Rs80 in the retail market. Cabbage and cauliflower prices have jumped by Rs15 and both vegetables are being sold at Rs30 a kg.Gour blamed the skyrocketing of vegetables prices in the city markets to the municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe’s anti-encroachment drive. The NMC is not allowing weekly vegetable markets and roadside vendors across the city, so the prices of vegetables in dedicated markets like Itwari, Mangalwari and Gokulpeth have increased manifold.Even today, TOI spotted NMC’s Dharampeth zone staffers along with nuisance detection squad removing vegetable vendors from roads and footpaths in Gokulpeth area. Similar action was also initiated in Sitabuldi area. “A delegation of APMC members will meet guardian minister Nitin Raut urging him to allow some time during the day to roadside vegetable vendors to do business,” he said.To a query, he said the winter harvest, which came a month late due to delay in planting, is going in full swing currently. With good rainfall last year and few spells of rains in the recent past, harvesting of the winter crop has been extended by a month. So supply of vegetables from local markets is ample, said Gour. “Due to coronavirus scare, we have restricted functioning of the Kalamna Market. Now, it will remain open from 4am to 12 noon,” he said.Meanwhile, demand of fruits has fallen drastically by over 50%, said wholesale dealer Rajesh Chhabrani from Kalamna Market. The wholesale market used to witness 400 to 450 truckloads of fruits from various destinations. “With poor demand, the number of vehicles supplying fruits had reduced to 250 last week. Today, only 20 vehicles with oranges arrived,” said Chhabrani.“In this situation, we have decided to keep the fruit section on the APMC premises shut from March 24 to March 31. Today, we have communicated to the fruit growers and suppliers not to visit the market from Tuesday,” he said.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74789553,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-707389,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-19-scare-anti-encroachment-drive-spike-prices-of-vegetables/articleshow/74783135.cms
315,['24/03/2020'],Covid-19: She tweaks popular logos to promote social distancing,"TimesView In a thickly populated country like ours, the concept of social distancing needs extra emphasis. Ananya’s off-beat campaign can help convey the message, especially among the younger crowd, a significant section of which has probably not grasped the severe implications of Covid-19. In the world of millennials, anything that’s quirky is cool and fashionably doable too. This young messenger has devised a novel way to ride on popular logos to draw attention to a way of life that wasn’t a part of our social DNA till yesterday.

BENGALURU: An Amul advertisement sans the chubby little girl, the Nirma ad without the girl swirling in a pretty white frock and the Starbucks logo where the twin-tailed mermaid is missing. All these and more, captioned: Everyone around the world has gone home, why are you still here?A campaign by Ananya Bashyam, 18, a first-year student of National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), on social distancing is gaining popularity. In the campaign, she tweaks popular advertisements/logos to spread the message of social distancing.“I realised Gen Z can’t relate to most of the government advisories. Millennials do not listen if they are just given a list of rules to follow. They need humour to notice things. Even the colour palette and the artwork that the older generation likes need not resonate with youngsters. They should be quirky and relatable to things that we grow with. That’s how I took to these extremely classic Indian logos,” said Ananya.With the campus shutting and students being asked to leave in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, Ananya, who is from Hyderabad, is back home. “I am loaded with class work. But when work on the Adobe software gets too much, I shift to other stuff as a stressbuster. I have been working on comics and recently visited the Indian Cartoon Gallery. So, all these were playing on my mind when I had this epiphany of redoing the classic logos. It became popular with my friends,” added Ananya.Thus far, the youngster has done five logos — Amul, Nirma, Starbucks, Asian Paints and Looney Tunes. “When it comes to animation, the So Sorry series is my favourite and I draw inspiration from that,” she added.Ananya is displaying her works on Instagram. NIFT Bangalore director Susan Thomas tweeted about her work saying: “My brilliant student @BengaluruNIFT ananya did this visual creative urging all to go home.”",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74785723,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-342580,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/nift-student-tweaks-popular-logos-to-promote-social-distancing/articleshow/74782649.cms

He said, “Three suspects accosted Sonawane outside the hotel over a monetary dispute but he fled into a lane. The suspects then chased and attacked him and one of them hit Sonawane with a wooden stick.

BENGALURU: The high court on Monday said in view of the emergency-like situation created by Covid-19, the government should use its discretionary powers in the matter of demolition of illegal structures/removal of encroachments and also recovery of arrears under the Karnataka Land Revenue Act.

A division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka noted that the court is not expressing any view in the issue, but at the same time, wherever necessary, the authorities could seek further time for implementation vis-a-vis demolition of illegal structures/removal of encroachments or for collection of revenue arrears.

By doing so, the government could help in reducing the number of people coming to court in a situation where social distancing is the need of the hour, the bench said.

As for the PIL seeking directions to the government to effectively deal with the situation created by coronavirus, the bench said both the state and central governments have taken a number of steps based on experts’ advice and the court won’t pass any direction which could unsettle the entire process. The PIL will be heard next week.

In a related development, the bench declined to take up a batch of petitions seeking postponement of the National Population Register exercise in the backdrop of the shutdown. The bench noted that as of now, there is nothing on record to show NPR is being taken up.

About 15,000-20,000 tonnes of mangoes are exported each year to eight countries, including the US, Singapore, London, Brazil and UK. With these countries and India reeling under the contagion, no exports are expected this year.“By this time, farmers normally finalise the export orders. But this year, not even a single order has come from foreign shores so far,” said M Kamalakshi Rajanna, former chairman of Karnataka State Mango Development and Marketing Board.Exporters couldn’t even get visas to go to these countries to sign contracts. The prices of mangoes in the domestic market too have nosedived after the state government announced a lockdown. While in normal years, the prices range between Rs 145 and Rs 300 per kg depending on the variety, this time they are around Rs 40.Even in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, which are among the earliest to harvest the fruit, prices have crashed.Kiran Kumar Vissa, coordinator of the National Coalition for Sustainable Agriculture, said the state government must set up mango storage facilities across the state and start procuring the fruit from farmers.Maize has been badly hit because its main consumer, the poultry industry, has almost stopped procuring maize given the sharp decline in chicken sales. Chicken sales are down because of both Covid-19 and the bird flu scare. While 14 lakh quintals of maize were sold till mid-March last year, only 6.6 lakh quintals has been sold till now this year.“The government cannot procure maize under the minimum support price scheme because there are few takers for it in the public distribution system.

322,['24/03/2020'],"Decade on, govt yet to act against errant excise officials","BENGALURU: Over a decade on, the excise department is yet to take action against 25 officials who erred in renewing/granting licences to liquor shops and bars in violation of the rules.

As many as 18 cases have been booked against the officials since 2009 and barring two, the other cases are either in various stages of inquiry or awaiting permission from higher-ups for further action.

For instance, a bar licence was sanctioned to Hotel Basant Residence in Bengaluru and renewed despite the establishment falling within 100 metres of a Jain temple in Gandhinagar . Though a case was filed in 2009 against then excise deputy commissioner Mallikarjun Gaddi , the department is still in consultation with the Lokayukta over penalising him.

These cases mainly pertain to illegal validation of bar licences, giving bar licences to lodges in violation of the law, allowing bars to function in unauthorised premises and near schools and temples and recommending the licences despite the applicant not fulfilling conditions.

The slow pace of inquiry can be attributed to collusion of the officials, licence holders and politicians, say excise department staff. “The government doesn’t really want to punish errant officials because it’s politicians who encourage them to do illegal things.

BENGALURU: Financier-cum-hotelier VK Mohan alias Kapali Mohan was found hanging in a hotel on the premises of Basaveshwara bus terminal in Peenya.

The incident came to light on Monday morning when the staff of the hotel, in which he was a partner, knocked on the door of Mohan’s room and grew suspicious on receiving no response. Police rushed to the spot, broke open the door and found Mohan hanging from the ceiling fan.

On Sunday night, he had left his Sadashivanagar residence around 8.45pm and dined with his friend Manju in the same hotel. Later, he spoke to his son at midnight and retired to the room.

Mohan had recorded a video on his mobile phone in which he explained how he had suffered financial losses after bagging the tender for shops and a hotel at the bus station. He had participated in the tender process after the government made an announcement about decongesting Majestic by shifting North Karnataka-bound buses to Peenya terminal. However, the buses weren’t shifted and the footfall at the station did not increase, causing Mohan to incur losses, police said.

Deputy commissioner of police (north) N Shashikumar said Mohan was facing financial issues and the video indicates he took the extreme step for the same reason. “We are in touch with Mohan’s family,” he said.

“Mohan had taken a loan of Rs 30 crore to run the shops and hotel. He had sold a few immovable properties to tide over the losses,” police sources said.

A division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka noted that the court is not expressing any view in the issue, but at the same time, wherever necessary, the authorities could seek further time for implementation vis-a-vis demolition of illegal structures/removal of encroachments or for collection of revenue arrears.

By doing so, the government could help in reducing the number of people coming to court in a situation where social distancing is the need of the hour, the bench said.

As for the PIL seeking directions to the government to effectively deal with the situation created by coronavirus, the bench said both the state and central governments have taken a number of steps based on experts’ advice and the court won’t pass any direction which could unsettle the entire process.

The health department is fumigating the cantonment areas and has started an awareness drive. On Monday, the Cantonment police station and the board officials closed down shops, including bakeries, across the cantonment as a precautionary measure to contain the virus.

On Monday, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Market and vegetable markets in Ghorpadi and Kumbhar Bawdi were open to the public. These establishments were closed on Saturday and Sunday.

Residents, activists and board members felt these places should open only twice or thrice a week considering the prevailing situation in the city.

340,['24/03/2020'],Nagpur breathes fresh as lockdown delivers cleaner air,"NAGPUR: The ongoing coronavirus lockdown may have turned our world topsy turvy but it has had one good fallout. It has improved the air quality of the city. The levels of two major toxins nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) have significantly gone down.TOI analyzed the data of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and found the levels of toxic pollutants saw a significant drop in the city post the Janata Curfew. Before it, the levels of NO2 and CO were as high as 165 and 127 micrograms per cubic metre (mpcm) respectively.However, post the lockdown, the NO2 levels saw a drastic drop to 47 mpcm while the CO levels reduced to 63 mpcm. From 89 on March 21, the overall AQI of the city reduced to 74 on Sunday.According to experts, a drastic drop in the number of vehicles on road and other activities led to the improved air quality. “The shutting down of transport sector along with other non-essential activities has brought enormous decline in NO2, CO and particulate matter which are majorly emitted from vehicles and fuel burning. The curfew has been a blessing in disguise for us as we can now define the pie of source contribution,” said Padma Rao, senior principal scientist at CSIR- National Environmental Engineering Research Institute’s (Neeri) air pollution control division.Highlighting that air pollution levels in the city had gone down by 30% due to lockdowns, founder of Green Vigil Kaustav Chatterjee said, “Major contributors to air pollution in the city are construction activity, roads and transportation. Lockdown has reduced pollution levels as there is a restriction on these. Many citizens have observed birds are coming out in large numbers after the lockdown, which is a sign of human interference in the ecosystem.”Stating that vehicles contributed nearly 18% of the city’s air pollution, environmental activist Leena Buddhe said, “Apart from it, many industries have shut down, construction activities of road, metro etc have stopped. Hence the major contributors of pollution have gone. The local government should take this as a lesson and take mitigation measures like ecofriendly transport, building green corridors and fountains to suppress dust.”Rao stated that more information on air quality data of coming days of lockdown will throw up major insights on air pollution mitigation, thus providing inputs in streamlining the action plans. “Major reforms are needed in transport sector to improve air quality. Alternative options like use of electric/CNG/Clean fuel etc for commercial vehicles will prove effective. Apart from this, transition towards BS-VI standard, rationalization of use of cars, improved signaling and traffic decongestion will help in significant reduction of pollution,” she said, adding that use of public transport should be encouraged.In agreement, Chatterjee added, “Government can definitely analyze this reduction of pollution and put forth as an example of how human activities are polluting our atmosphere. This can be taken as lesson to formulate a local act for plying vehicles and riders to combat air pollution.”",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74789508,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-185502,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-breathes-fresh-as-lockdown-delivers-cleaner-air/articleshow/74783148.cms

On Monday, the traffic police stopped an autorickshaw driver at Law College Square ferrying six passengers in his three-wheeler from Wadi to Maharajbagh.After making the passengers to deboard, the traffic police detained the autorickshaw of Anis Khan. Not only Khan’s autorickshaw, the traffic police from all 10 zones on Monday detained 273 more autorickshaws for violating orders to keep the vehicles off roads.“There’s a lot of panic among autorickshaw drivers across the state. Earlier, we used to earn anything between Rs 500-Rs 800 a day.

NAGPUR: On the day TOI reported lack of screening of domestic flyers, the health officials screened and quarantined 69 of them who had returned from foreign countries via other Indian cities. According to district officials, 159 flyers are now put up at the MLA hostel in quarantine .

TOI had reported on Monday no passenger arriving in a domestic flight was screened either on Saturday or Sunday. So far, only passengers coming from international flights were being screened. Now as the international flights have been suspended, the screening equipment has been lying idle.

During normal times, 3,500 passengers reach Nagpur airport .

Even though the number has reduced drastically, at least 500 passengers may have “escaped” screening.

As only two international flights connect Nagpur, a number of passengers coming from abroad land here in a domestic flight. Hence, a decision to screen domestic passengers also was taken.

Despite district guardian minister Nitin Raut’s announcement regarding screening domestic passengers arriving at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport for Covid-19, instructions to that effect had not been passed on to the airport operator.

This first batch of screened domestic flyers is expected to stay here for at least 48 hours. Those residing within city limits would be stamped ‘home quarantined’ and dropped home in special bus. Those staying outside Nagpur district or showing symptoms will have to stay for 14 days.

NAGPUR: As the state goes under curfew and movement of people gets restricted, some guardian angels have stared reaching out to those in need. Senior citizens who live alone, relatives of outstation patients admitted in hospitals and daily wagers who have limited resources now find themselves with fewer resources to access the services they need.

Khushroo Poacha’s Neki Ka Pitara initiative has been helping feed hundreds of people at hospitals taking care of their relatives and now his scope has increased. Poacha said, “With restaurants closed, the relatives of patients have nowhere to eat. We are now planning to pack cooked food in disposable packets and keep on a designated table in hospital. The relatives can come and pick one. This way we don’t come in contact with each other. We are stocking free food in hospital fridges through security guards, not entering inside premises.”

Now Poacha is planning to deliver dry grains and wheat flour to slums in a systematic manner. “Can’t go out there to distribute as it will be chaos. So we will approach huge socities where maids come. Through these societies we will hand weekly rations to the maids,” said Poacha. Nagpur Municipal Corporation too has contacted Poacha and sought help in distributing food packets in slums.

Veeru Anand and her husband Amit have offered their services to deliver any emergency material to senior citizens. “There are many senior citizens and their children living abroad are worried. So we are delivering medicines and groceries to them as per request of their children,” said Anand.

A message posted on the group of Saraswati Vidyalaya Alumni Association assured elderly parents in need of medicine supplies they won’t face any difficulty as the medicines will be delivered to their doorstep. “We did not want the aged parents to step out of their house in such a situation and put their lives at risk, hence we are helping a little from our side,” said Brijesh Segan , secretary of the association.

Currently this service is only restricted to the alumni group, but is surely an act of humanity. “We are all suffering because of the crisis of Corona outbreak, a little act of kindness is a relief in such times and we wanted to extend our support to all the elderly people,” said Rajendra Kulkarni , president of the association.

Adding to this Mitesh Rambhia, secretary, said, “Everyone must try to help the other with whatever little resources they have, we took this step because its not safe for elderly parents to go out in such a situation.”

Pyare Khan, who has a huge transportation business, is lending support by providing free food to truck drivers stuck in city and unable to access food because of lockdown. His Ashmi Foundation promises free food to these drivers, “We were receiving calls from a few days from so many drivers that they are unable to find food as roadside dhabas are shut. Hence we decided to provide them food wherever in the city,” said Pyare Khan.

344,['24/03/2020'],"Bengaluru scientist’s Covid-19 device to be tested in US, Mexico","Representative image

BENGALURU: A device designed by an Indian scientist in Bengaluru with the potential of containing the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing Covid-19) will soon be tested in the US and Mexico for efficacy.

“The device will not be a cure. It’s aimed at containing infection by disabling the virus’ mechanism. I’m glad that the US and Mexico responded with such speed to test our device. We’ll be shipping out three prototypes (two to the US) on Tuesday,” Rajah Vijay Kumar, the inventor of the device told TOI.

He said he began work on the device — Scalene Hypercharge Corona Canon (SHYCOCAN) — in April 2019, after finding a dip in productive days at their campus due to common cold, and flu in 2018-19.

His team found a study by the Swedish Institute for communicable disease control and University of Linkoping, that showed promise in effective prevention of airborne transmitted Influenza A virus infection by use of active Ionisation of the infected environment.

“...We started work on these lines and developed SHYCOCAN, capable of producing a very high volume of free electrons into the environment,” Kumar said.

What It Does

In SARS-CoV-2, the initial attachment of the virion to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the S-protein and its receptor. And, the guiding mechanism is the negative transmembrane potential of the host cells.

“In simple terms, S-protein makes the virus to infect by seeking negative potential. For instance, our cell walls have a negative potential, which attracts the virus and the S-protein attaches the receptor. Our device is intended to disable S-protein by neutralising it with negatively charged electrons. This will effectively disable the virus’ mechanism to infect,” he explained.

SHYCOCAN, that can at least produce 10 to 100 trillion ions per second, is able to provide an electron density of a minimum 6 trillion per cubic centimetre at a distance of at least 12 centimetres from the canon. “The operating current is within a safe range,” Kumar said, adding that once the device is validated, he would be providing the designs to any manufacturer at a very affordable cost.

To reduce infectivity and air and surface borne propagation of Covid-19, Kumar said: “We need to build devices to pump out a large number of hypercharged electrons into the atmosphere, from wherever possible, that would lead to S-protein neutralisation and rendering the virus infectivity disabled. This kind of guidance and transmission jamming mechanisms can be easily achievable and is cost-effective. Bigger devices could also be built.”

US & Mexico

In the US, the state of Maryland will be testing the device through the Texas Southern University, while the government of Mexico’s National Council for Science and Technology will be testing it through its Technological Development, Cooperation and Innovation department.

In an official communication, Texas Southern University said: “...The specific device seems to offer a positive change in the containment of the virus, Covid-19. We would like to extend our support to have the device undergo further tests in the laboratories in Maryland; we would request you to send two devices by courier at the earliest.” TOI has the copy of this letter, and a similar letter from Mexico’s Technological Development, Cooperation and Innovation department seeking one prototype.

At a public event elaborating on measures and technologies being put in place to combat Covid-19 in Maryland last week, state authorities introduced Rayol John Augustus, founder, Shreis Scalene Sciences to elaborate on SHYCOCAN. The firm has a tie-up with Kumar.

“With the help of our team back in India, and with Rajah Vijay Kumar the inventor, we are bringing in this device that can be used in any forum, in any place where people gather. It can inactivate the virus. We need to test the device here in the solid ground of the United States. We will work with the US, the people of the state of Maryland,” Augustus said.

In conversations with state government officials, they have expressed their apprehensions over lack of protective equipment and urged the state government to take immediate measures.

There is a dire shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), masks and gloves. Other inputs like spirit, cotton and other drugs and medical supplies is also in short supply, said a government doctor, part of the COVID-19 task force team.

The situation is not good at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhopal. The premier institute was reluctant to admit Bhopal’s first COVID-19 positive to the hospital. Besides the patient being ‘not critically ill’, AIIMS authorities wanted Hamidia hospital to take the patient.

Sources said that Hamidia hospital was ‘not prepared’ and was only conducting its first emergency drill for handling the patients, when a live patient needed care. While there is a shortage of these products in the market, some suppliers are unwilling to supply to government sector. Some purchases made by GMC from open market were at exorbitant rates, sources of the hospital said.

AIIMS Bhopal has also requested the health department for more protective equipment along with other basic protective gear. “If the state government wants to utilise AIIMS Bhopal, they should also support with our requirements,” said an AIIMS Bhopal consultant.

Hamidia hospital has about 40 ventilators, of which about 10 would be in dedicated facility for COVID-19. A pneumonia isolation ward is also being planned. Elective surgeries in the hospital came down to six on Monday. It has an average of 30 surgeries per day.

OPD numbers that is about 2500 daily has also dropped drastically at Hamidia. OPD at AIIMS Bhopal has been closed till March 31 and only emergency services are being catered to at the hospital, following Union government guidelines.

346,['24/03/2020'],Contractual workers of solid waste department to continue work,"Pune: The solid waste department on Monday directed its contractual workers to continue to come to work, while the clerical staff was exempted from attending office.

The department instructed workers involved in essential services to remain present in office. Employees who will not attend office were told not to travel out of the city without prior permission.

The state government on Sunday directed civic bodies to reduce staff to 5%, but there was no respite for the solid waste department.

The solid waste department mostly depends on contractual workers to maintain cleanliness in the city. According to the Pune Municipal Corporation data, nearly 3,600 people work on contract for PMC’s conservancy works, while around 6,600 are part of the PMC staff for solid waste management. In addition, nearly 600 people work via various NGOs. Instructions were also given to private contractors to make sure the contractual workers appointed through them turned up for their duties.

These people were involved in road cleaning, lifting garbage, transporting it, maintaining the disposal units and waste segregation. Apart from them, members of the nuisance detection squad, who help in preventing citizens from littering, will continue to take action against those throwing garbage on the road or spitting.

“We are part of the essential services and will continue to function almost as we do normally. Some officials who are not directly involved in the essential services have been told to not report to office,” Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of PMC’s solid waste management department, said.

The PMC had decided to cut down the staff as a precautionary measure to contain the novel coronavirus spread. As part of it, 5% of the staff was to work from the municipal headquarters from Monday. But, most departments could not implement it.

According to PMC officials as per their previous plans they were to reduce the staff from 50% to 25% from Monday. But, the new orders issued by the state government on Sunday and imposition of Section 144 caused a change in plan.

“Those working on field specially to curb the spread of the virus are not exempted from work. Only those who are working from office and have desk jobs will be told to stay home,” a senior official of the labour department said.

He said the health, water, sold waste management, fire brigade and road departments would continue with their work.

PUNE: Many societies in the city are handing out soap, sanitizers and other essentials to wastepickers, while some are not allowing them to use common water facilities to even wash their hands.

The biggest hit for the wastepickers was the closure of scrap shops. “We get around Rs70 per house, a month. So, if we are working in a society, we earn around Rs3,000-4,000 a month. But, our day-to-day expenses are paid off by selling scrap, through which we earn between Rs100 and Rs300 a day. With scrap shops closed for nearly over a week, we have no money for daily expenses,” Anna Naiknaware (40), a wastepicker in Bibwewadi area, said.

Despite all the risks involved, there are some societies that have banned them from using water to even wash their hands. “I go to many societies and there are some that have told us to not use the tap to wash our hands. So, we carry a water bottle and fill it in societies where it is allowed and then wash our hands. Some societies have given us sanitizers when we enter, but do not give us soaps to wash our dirty hands after the work is done. As soon as we get home we have a bath and wash our clothes. We also have a family to take care of, sometimes they forget that,” Balubai Pawar, who works in the Katraj area, said.

While many people in the city have started segregating waste, there are still some who don’t and they throw used masks without properly wrapping it, said Sarubai Waghmare.

“It would be easier if such waste was properly wrapped, like sanitary napkins are, and had a separate mark (with a red dot) so that we would be more careful about handling it while segregating the waste,” Pawar said.

Harshad Barde, director of Solid Waste Collection and Handling (SWaCH) cooperative, said little compassion could go a long way in easing their pain. “While the Pune Municipal Corporation is doing whatever it can and has provided wastepickers with masks, gloves and will give soaps, it would be great if societies too can pitch in. The government has budgetary limitations and all essentials would be needed again in 15 days. Even if one sanitation worker falls ill, the rest will be scared. Once they start bunking work, the entire system will collapse,” he said.

Many expert and amateur birdwatchers, though confirned at home for the past eight days owing to lockdown, have observed a spurt in bird activity within the city.They attribute this to lowered human activity. Some have even suggested an ‘eco curfew ’ every month to encourage bird activity in city.“I stay near Sonegaon Lake and daily watch about 25-30 cattle egrets roost on a tree. Today, they came near our homes and were about 100 plus in number,” said avid bird watcher Nitin Marathe.He added, “The egrets were accompanied by a purple heron which is a big bird and prefers calm, away from the hustle-bustle of the city. Three river terns were also spotted in the skies above Sonegaon Lake and were very vocal. This may be due to sparse traffic and noise pollution going down.”“There is more chirping of house sparrows and mynas calling each other loudly. Further a brown rock chat was also noticed,” he adds.Several bird watchers like Surendra Agnihotri from Laxmi Nagar echoed the same feeling. “There was an eerie calm during the last few days owing to Janata Curfew and lockdown. The birds made most of the reduced human activities and — importantly — less sound pollution to make merry, making home birding from terrace more enjoyable,” he said.Agnihotri, who regularly watches birds from his balcony, said, “For the first time, I sighted a common sandpiper. It flew around the canal and vanished through the rain tree. Though common, the bird was never seen in city.”“Similarly, I heard unmistakable calls of tickel’s blue flycatcher after three years. I also recorded a white-breasted waterhen. This is very shy bird. Though the species is not new but they are emboldened by the serenity caused by lesser traffic,” said Agnihotri.Avid bird watcher and mining engineer with IBM Shirish Gajralwar, a resident of Sonegaon, recorded orange headed thrush in house garden. “During morning walk, I recorded a pied kingfisher and a pair of white-breasted kingfisher, besides golden oriole, common iora, shikra, and asian koel. This is something new. Since last week there is an increase in bird activity.”“I was surprised to get a prize catch, an Indian paradise flycatcher, at my residence,” says Ameya Marathe from Kolhapur.The bird watchers are so overjoyed by the spurt in bird sightings that bird and nature lover Ketaki Ghate from Pune has appealed over the social media through her post — “Let’s support Janata Curfew and continue it as eco-curfew. It is high time we all observe eco-curfew on first Sunday of every month to restore and improve status of natural resources, processes and biodiversity,” said Ghate.Bird expert from BNHS Raju Kasambe, Mumbai, has some similar observation. “When I walked on Monday to buy milk, I recorded 10 bird species in hardly 300 metres in a city like Mumbai.”",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74789378,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-193492,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/as-humans-are-caged-in-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-birds-reclaim-the-city-skies/articleshow/74783174.cms

Police suspect that it could be a case of female infanticide.

According to police sources, the baby, the third daughter of Muthupandi and Suriyapraba, was born on February 6 at the Sedapatti primary health centre. It died on February 15. The parents buried the baby in the backyard of their house. The incident created a flutter in the village and reached the health officials. When the village nurse approached the parents, she was told that the child had died due to choking while she was being breastfed.

The incident was brought to the knowledge of the Sedapatti police 10 days ago, but police did not file any case. Only after a complaint from the village administrative officer K Prabakaradoss was filed, a case was registered under CrPc section 174- suspicious death on Saturday.

Following this, the body was exhumed on Monday in the presence of police and revenue officials. A medical team conducted spot postmortem and collected visceral samples to be sent for lab testing.

Peraiyur deputy superintendent of police Mathialagan told TOI that they have not altered the case from CrPc 174 to any other section. They will decide on it based on the outcome of the ongoing investigation. The parents have reiterated their statement that the baby died due to suffocation only. He said that they are awaiting the lab report, which will throw more light into the incident.

Clashes were reported at a few places since the supplies were not adequate. The police intervened and the supply was normalise by afternoon.

Medical shop owners have raised concern over the transport-related issues. Madan Patil, head of chemist association, said that transport of medicines takes place in bulk from Pune and Bhiwandi. At both these places, restrictions have been enforced over the movement of the transport vehicles.

“We fear there will be delay in the supply of medicines. The requirement is currently low. The demand has dipped by around 60%. The customers from outside the city have totally stopped. Around 70% medicine depots are in both these cities. We, however, are ensuring to make medicines available for all the patients approaching,” he said.

The medical shop owners said that they are facing the shortage of the masks and the sanitisers, which continue to be in demand. Moreover, the shops are running out of soaps, said one shop owner.

The availability of milk and bread was less as many shops claimed the stock was yet to arrive. On Sunday, the Janata Curfew day, the sale of milk and bread came down to 50% as many people had stocked it earlier.

Tahir Mullani, resident of Line Bazaar, said, “We do not know what is going to happen in coming days. We have to feed our families. How is it even possible when we are not allowed to get out and buy those things?”

KOLKATA: With the state government asking the Medical College Hospital, Kolkata (MCHK) authority about the feasibility of converting the entire institute as the centre for isolating Covid-19 suspected patients and also treating the confirmed cases, the hospital administration has started taking steps to make it ready for the purpose.

“We have not received any letter yet. But we have been told verbally to work on it. Therefore, we have started drawing up a plan on how to relocate the patients who are currently getting treated in different departments,” said an official at the state-run hospital located on College Street.

The hospital currently has 2,200 beds, that includes 300 beds at the newly constructed superspecialty building that has not been utilized yet. MCHK principal Manjushree Ray had suggested during CM Mamata Banerjee’s meeting with government and private hospitals in Nabanna a few days ago that the 300 unutilised beds could be used during this crisis.

But with the three patients testing positive for Covid-19 on Sunday and the death on Monday, health department officials apprehend the crisis to hit the roof in the days ahead. The ID Hospital in Beliaghata is also running out of beds due to the rush.

“The number of confirmed cases so far has not reached the double digit. But imagine the number of people who had come in direct contact with this seven. Ideally, instead of keeping them at quarantine centres, these high-risk category people should be kept under hospital isolation and get their swab samples tested. That is why the need for a totally dedicated hospital for the purpose,” said a health department official.

Out of the 40-odd departments in MCHK, about 30 admit patients (who need hospital treatment) from its OPD in addition to the patients from the emergency wing. The rest of the departments like pathology, anatomy and forensic do not have much to do directly with patients.

“We have asked all department heads to draw up the number of patients admitted in their respective wards and also prepare a separate list of patients who can be kept under home care for now,” said another administrator at MCHK. “We are also working out with other hospitals on how many patients we could shift to their facilities. . Things will take a proper shape in the next three days,” he added.

Sources said the number of operational beds — 1,900 — remain mostly occupied with departments like medicine being the most busy one. “Luckily, there has been a dip in patient rush for about a week now. The occupancy currently will be about 70%,” said an official.

Only vehicles exempted by the state government will be allowed once the curfew comes into place.

Shops were closed in various parts of the city including Nethaji Road, West Masi Street and South Masi Street. After the police made the announcement to down shutters, shops such as bakeries and sweet shops continued their activity with shutters half down.

However, East Masi Street, the hub of essentials like oil, groceries and other household needs, was buzzing with activity with a large number of people thronging the shops. “Not just in East Veli Street, grocery stores in all parts of the city witnessed huge crowds. Although government has announced that grocery stores will remain open as usual, people were in panic mode and thronged the stores to stock essentials,” R Shanmugam, a resident of K K Nagar , said.

Due to increased demand, price of vegetables, which started increasing from Friday, witnessed a steep rise on Monday as a large number of people thronged the markets.

The association said that this could be permitted after testing the driver and cleaner who will be the only occupants. The association also sought extension in concessions to products made by small level industries by at least six months in the GST structure.

In a memorandum to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and minister for health and family welfare Harsh Vardhan, the association stated that the Tamil Nadu government has banned all cargo trucks including those carrying essential food items from entering the state. Small and medium industries are dependent on other states for their raw material needs, association president S P Jeyapragasam said.

He said the government has to allow these trucks after a medical checkup of the crew. “This procedure should be allowed for the transportation of finished goods also. By doing this, the general public will get benefited as they can get their products without shortage,” he said.

The association also said filing and paying of GST dates can be deferred by another 15 days penalty while interest should not be levied for genuine late payment cases.

They also urged banks to give six months time for repaying instalments for loans that were obtained by small scale industries. Considering the economic slowdown and production hit as a result of Covid-19 they also requested banks to consider reducing interest rate for loans to 3% per annum.

Jeyapragasam suggested the government could increase revenue by offering special deposit scheme with attractive interest rates for the public against gold and cash deposits.

He said that these suggestions will give a breathing space for general public and stakeholders who are hit by the economic slowdown as a result of Covid-19 and to revive the economy.

Considering the increase in demand and price of masks, sanitizers, personal protective equipment (PPE) kit and infrared thermometers due, empower centre for consumer and environmental education, research and advocacy has appealed to the government to exempt those items from the GST structure.

Executive director of the consumer body A Sankar stated that masks have 5% GST, while sanitizers and PPE kits are in the 12% bracket. Infrared thermometers attract 18% GST.

Earlier this month, civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti submitted the draft budget of the KMC with total outlay of over Rs 1,100 crore. After the submission, the standing committee started the deliberations required to draft the final budget. The final budget includes the suggestions of the corporators. However, the discussions have been halted.Kalshetti said, “We are scrutinising the legal options to get through the issue. We are told that the financial year has been extended till June end. However, we have not yet received any such directions in written from the state government. We will deliberate over the other ways.”The officials claim that the standing committee’s approval can be considered as final in case the emergency occurs and there is difficulty to call the general body meeting.

KOLKATA: The air traffic control in Kolkata that is responsible for safe movement of nearly 1,300 flights daily in eastern India and over Bay of Bengal is adopting extraordinary measures in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.

With no lockdown option — as that could result in catastrophic mid-air collisions — ATC has prepared a reserve force that will be on standby at their home, ready to be deputed at short notice in an emergency.

“Starting Monday, six controllers will be on reserve and available to report for duty 24×7. This contingency is to ensure that the ATC in Kolkata remains functional even if one member of the team on duty develops Covid-19 symptoms and requires everyone on the shift to be put in home isolation. The reserve force that will then take over the surveillance and navigation of flights from a sanitized and sealed contingency room on the third floor of the ATC building,” a senior ATC official revealed.

Though they have taken social separation measures, there is anxiety over DGCA continuing with breathalyzer tests before controllers report for duty. The Air Traffic Controllers’ Guild has written to both DGCA and the PMO, demanding immediate suspension of the practice that all law enforcement agencies have discontinued in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic as it increases the risk of transmission of the virus. “Even if one controller gets infected due to this, Kolkata ATC will have to shut down,” warned the guild’s Kolkata general secretary Kailash Pati Mandal.

There are 285 controllers in Kolkata. Around 50 are on duty in each shift. They are responsible for the safety of over 2 lakh flyers daily, making it a zero-error margin job that entails huge levels of stress. Together they used to handle around 1,600 flight movements daily till last month. But in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, the number has come down to 1,250. From Wednesday, it is expected to reduce further to 650.

The area control that guides flights heading into and out of the region as well as those passing Kolkata, either on domestic or international routes, currently operates from the fourth floor of the building. In addition, there is a tower control on the eighth floor that guides planes that land and take off from the city.

PUNE: The husband of the 41-year-old woman, who is undergoing treatment at Bharati hospital for Covid-19, was also found infected with the contagion late on Sunday evening, pushing up Pune’s case tally to 28.

In the state, the count of covid-19 positive cases touched 97 on Monday, with Mumbai recording its sharpest single-day jump with 13 new cases. Incidentally, 10 of the 13 new infections are close contacts of the patients, raising questions on whether quarantining measures are adequate. Overall, Mumbai now has 37 positive cases, while MMR has 53 cases.

“The Pune woman’s husband works as manager in a hotel. We are also tracing his close contacts. The woman’s father and her nephew have tested negative for Covid-19. Her mother and daughter also tested negative earlier on Sunday,” said a civic health official.

About 100 people who have come in close contact with the woman have been traced and advised home quarantine. The woman’s sister who is a nurse at the Bharati hospital was one of the four family members who tested positive for Covid-19.

“She is the one who moved the woman from a private hospital on Sinhagad Road to Bharati hospital on March 16 after she was diagnosed with viral pneumonia,” the official said.

Of the 28 positive cases in Pune since March 9, 16 patients are residents of the areas within the limits of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and another 12 are the residents of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas. Of the patients in Pune municipal limits, eight are residents of housing societies in Sinhagad Road area.

Health minister rules out community transmission

Health minister Rajesh Tope said there was no case of community transmission in the state as of now. “All those who have tested positive are either high-risk contacts of previous positive patients or have a foreign travel history,” he said. Mumbai guardian minister Aslam Shaikh said a decision to add isolation facilities at ST George, JJ and GT hospitals was taken on Monday, and these would be readied in the next six days.

376,['24/03/2020'],Doctors want spitting in public spaces punished,"Hubballi: Understanding the severity of the threat posed by Covid-19, the Gujarat government made spitting in public places a punishable offence, and the question in the minds of many residents in Karnataka is if the state will follow suit. Across the state, and particularly in North Karnataka, spitting is a widely prevalent menace, largely owing to the number of people who chew guthka, pan and other tobacco products.

On the one hand, both the state and central governments have been pressing the public to leave no stone unturned as far as personal hygiene is concerned, enjoining on them the need to constantly wash their hands, se of sanitisers, et al. However, neither the state nor the central government is yet to issue a similar advisory against the largely common practice of spitting, which is a very dangerous habit in these times.

Dr MC Sindhur, a physician, said that spitting was particularly dangerous since the mucous containing the virus could well infect others. “The Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) must act to curb this practice. The officials concerned can no longer remain mum. It is high time a ban was imposed on spitting and clearing of noses in public areas,” said Dr Sindhur.

Dr GB Sattur, a senior cardiologist, said that few people were aware of the germs and pathogens that sputum and phlegm contained, and continued to spit without care for the wellbeing of others. “It is a most unhygienic practice. Diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) can spread in the air. People must take it upon themselves to stop spitting in public places,” he said.

Dr Jagadish Tubachi, a cancer surgeon, said that, for every lakh people who were addicted to tobacco products, around 16 to 20 developed oral cancer, and called on people to kick the habit.

Dr Alok Kulkarni stressed the need to wean people off the habit by counseling them through motivational enhancement therapy.

HDMC solid waste management executive engineer R Vijaykumar said that the civic agency was contemplating implementing a slew of measures to put an end to the menace. “Despite repeatedly appealing to the public, many continue to spit in public places. We had sent a proposal to the urban development department seeking permission to penalise spitting. Once this proposal is approved, people will be fined not only for spitting, but also for urinating, bathing and other acts considered public nuisance. While people who commit these acts for the first time will be fined RS 300, the fine will be hiked to Rs 300 the second time around,” Vijaykumar said.

Bins for spitting

Doctors opined that municipal corporations and civic bodies must install separate bins where public can spit into. They also called for raising awareness among the public about the perils of spitting. Not only are people spitting on roads, buses, but also in hospitals.

Most want to know if they require testing. On an average, 90-120 patients come each day to OPDs at NIMHANS, of whom 20-30% are exhibiting increase in anxiety disorders due to the contagion. As per our clinical registry, the anxiety is the highest in elderly patients (above 50 years) and their family members, while 60% of the pre-existing depression and anxiety disorders have worsened. About 5% of them have reported guilt and suicidal thoughts. Of the follow-up patients over the past month, 18-20 of the 60 patients have reported worsening symptoms,” Debanjan Banerjee, MD Psychiatry at NIMHANS, told TOI.NIMHANS gets cases/calls not just from Bengaluru, but also cities like Pune, Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur and Kolkata etc.Banerjee said that almost 80% of the patients now demand testing for Covid-19, as do 20-30 calls placed to their virology department and a medical institute close by. “I personally get at least 5-10 calls/mails asking whether Covid-19 is dangerous and whether testing will be necessary. Over the past week, the elderly patients have decreased in OPD by over 60% due to the fear of COVID transmission,” he said.Doctor Rakesh K Chadda, secretary-general, World Association of Social Psychiatry (WASP), said, Major fears among patients these days include fear of getting the infection and concerns about availability/non availability of specific treatment. “It is possible that this fear can rise in the coming days, with the increase in positive cases and fatalities,” said Chadda, who is also professor and head of psychiatry, and chief, National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, AIIMS, New Delhi.Chadda said that there was a general anxiety among people or a fear of getting the infection in the backdrop of media reports, which is reflected in use of masks by and hoarding. “In psychiatry, we have not seen any patients coming only with a fear of Covid-19. A general concern is present in the patients coming for their primary psychiatric problem,” he said.Pune-based clinical psychologist and online psychotherapist Prachi S Vaish said the pandemic was affecting the mental health of people in two ways. “Spreading an ‘anxiety epidemic’, where people have become hypervigilant, paranoid and germaphobic — this is the reason for hoarding; and people who are already struggling with mental health issues are experiencing exacerbated symptoms and relating every experience of distress to Covid-19,” she said.“This is a mass hysteria issue more than an individual mental health issue, and needs to be tackled by psychological first-ad and group interventions that are focused on relieving anxiety, which can cause the logical part of the brain to shut down.

It’s terrifying,” said the resident of a gated complex in Parel which has over 450 flats.Building chat groups across the city are buzzing with concerns about the refusal of globe-trotting residents to self-quarantine just because they arrived a few days before the government made it mandatory. In one building, a family that returned from Dubai sent children down to play.Now, with cases being reported from prominent buildings, the tide is turning and residents are getting tougher on this transgression.Most large buildings had asked residents to fill out forms declaring recent foreign travel and to quarantine themselves for two weeks.Initially few complied. “When we asked questions, people used to get angry. But after a case was detected in a building nearby, many more responses came in,” said a building committee member.A highrise in Parel sent guards to each flat to get travel declaration forms filled.

They are putting everyone at risk,” said a resident.

384,['24/03/2020'],‘Novel coronavirus hasn’t changed its virulence after mutations’,"Researcher Sreejith Rajasekharan is part of a team in Italy that recently isolated and sequenced SARS-CoV-2

It got worse with each passing month. In just over 100 days, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for 14,700 deaths and over 3,00,000 infections worldwide. In terms of economics, experts say the virus has changed the world permanently.

Sreejith Rajasekharan, an Arturo-Falaschi ICGEB Post-doctoral Fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Virology — part of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) in Trieste — is part of a team that recently isolated and sequenced SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. In an interview with TOI, he explains the latest results from investigations into the new coronavirus.

Q) Many compare the new coronavirus with the pathogen responsible for the H1N1 outbreak from 2009. Are they the same?

A) The H1N1/09, also known as the swine flu virus, is not the same as SARS-CoV-2. The viruses belong to two different families and differ in structure and genome organisation. However, both viruses are airborne, transmitted through droplet infection either directly, or through fomites, to cause respiratory illness. SARS-CoV-2 is of course virulent. But the seasonal flu (Influenza virus) is responsible for more deaths every year. Then again, scientists have studied seasonal flu for decades and we know what to expect each season. Very little is known about SARS-CoV-2.

Q) SARS-CoV-2 seems to be affecting both the upper and lower respiratory tracts…

A) Yes, observations so far support the fact that SARS-CoV-2 can affect both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Scientists are yet to understand how it has been able to replicate in both these sites.

Q) Did SARS and MERS affect both the upper and lower respiratory systems as well?

A) In humans, both SARS and MERS primarily affected the lower respiratory tract. Involvement of the upper respiratory tract is uncommon and when seen, it’s very mild. This is especially true in the case of MERS in which the receptor for the virus is not expressed in the upper respiratory tract of humans. That's why there is restricted transmission. There were reports of the SARS virus replicating in the upper respiratory tract. But the severity of the disease is tied to the virus infection in the lower respiratory tract.

Q) What are the most dangerous characteristics of the new virus?

A) Well, one of them of course is its airborne nature and the ability to be transmitted between humans directly or through fomites without an intermediate vector. Then there is the recent observation that the new virus can infect both upper and lower respiratory tracts. Viruses that only replicate in the upper respiratory tract cause mild infections, but spread easily. In contrast, the ones that infect the lower respiratory tract cause severe infections. But they are not as contagious as the former. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to replicate in both sites helps it enter a population and spread in stealth mode. By the time the first infected person starts showing signs of illness (observed to be on an average a fortnight from day of infection), the virus has already made an impact in that population and has most likely entered a new population. The elderly are severely impacted because their immune systems have grown weak with age.

Q) Is this virus mutating? Will it acquire ways to become more virulent?

A) Theoretically, the virus mutates every time it replicates. This is common for all viruses. More than a hundred mutations have been documented for SARS-CoV-2 since the start of the pandemic. I am part of a team that recently isolated and sequenced SARS-CoV-2 here in Italy. Our isolates are different from the ones sequenced in China. None of these mutations have been drastic enough to change the virulence of the virus. These mutations occur at random; we cannot predict the consequences. About re-emergence in the following winter, evidence suggests the new coronavirus is not affected by seasonal changes. It is winter now in the northern hemisphere, but it's summer in most of the southern hemisphere. Covid-19 cases are being reported in Latin America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand as well.

Q) Do you think the new coronavirus will become a dominant, ever-present strain over the next few years?

A) Unfortunately, the answer is yes. It is highly likely. However, if there is a second outbreak in future, we will not be caught off-guard. There are vaccines that are being developed. Research is being carried out to study the virus biology. The more we know, the better equipped we will be.

Q) What does this mean to citizens? Should we continue social distancing through the coming months until there is a viable vaccine or a treatment protocol?

A) Social distancing is the only way we can control the spread. Look at what has happened in Italy. From a handful of cases in Rome towards the end of February, there are today almost 60,000 positive cases and 6,000 deaths, all within less than a month. We cannot behave irrationally, hoping that a vaccine or a treatment will be developed soon. Of course, vaccines have reached the human trials stage. But by the time it is mass produced, the virus would've run through us if left unchecked. Healthy, young people should not take this outbreak lightly, just because it doesn’t pose a direct threat to them. They can still act as carriers and transmit it to someone whose body might not be able to fight the virus.

385,['24/03/2020'],Wrong info makes tracking patient movement difficult,"Madurai: With district officials facing difficulties in tracking the movement of the 43-year-old male Covid-19 patient admitted to the isolation ward at Tirunelveli medical college hospital (MCH), collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish on Monday urged the people to follow home quarantine more strictly.

The collector told TOI that though the patient is showing improvement he is still undergoing treatment at the isolation ward. “I spoke to the patient. His symptoms had reduced compared to Sunday and he was able to communicate without difficulty. We are making all efforts to not miss any person who may have been in contact with him and quarantine them,” she said. However, sources said that local district officials were apprehensive when putting together the patient’s contact history.

“The whole purpose of putting together contact history is to ensure that infection doesn’t spread even by mistake. However, on investigation and cross-verification, it was found that the patient may have been staying for four days at a hotel room though the patient himself has insisted till Monday morning that he had been just staying with one friend at a room in a village,” a source.

The source from the health department further added that whatever information the patient gives for contact history could not be 100% accurate or trustworthy, so it has been difficult to track his movements. So far, the co-passenger of the car by which he came to Tirunelveli from Madurai and the friend staying with him have been quarantined as a precautionary measure.

On the other hand, Madurai district health officials said that the patient was screened on March 17 at Madurai airport . “He was not symptomatic then, so we advised home quarantine as per protocol. I urge the public to be more responsible when in home quarantine and immediately seek medical help if any symptoms of Covid-19 appear,” said Dr P Priya Raj, deputy director of health services, Madurai.

NEW DELHI: The government on Monday eased the proposed rules for taxing non-resident Indians to ensure that the middle-class and normal workers are not burdened, while arming itself with powers to raise excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 8 per litre each in future.There was major relief for Indians whose children study abroad as overseas remittance out of specified domestic loans will attract 0.5% TCS (tax collected at source), for which credit is available while calculating the annual liability, against the 5% proposed in the Finance Bill on overseas remittances of over Rs 7 lakh.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman moved an amendment to the Bill to increase the limit up to which the Centre can raise special excise duty on petrol and diesel to Rs 18 per litre and Rs 12, respectively. The government hiked excise on the two auto fuels earlier this month, taking advantage of the fall in global crude prices in the wake of coronavirus pandemic.This will allow the government to increase the revenue collection from petrol and diesel, without hopefully, changing the final price to the consumer, to augment any revenue loss on account of economic losses in other sectors in the current scenario,” said Bipin Sapra, partner for indirect tax at consulting firm EY India.The Finance Bill, 2020, was passed by Lok Sabha in a record 29 minutes on Monday, with no discussion or debate being permitted. The decision to pass the legislation was taken at an all-party meeting, where Speaker Om Birla and floor leaders of all parties agreed to take the exceptional step in light of the country-wide lockdown and the need to adjourn Parliament early.When the Finance Bill was taken up for consideration and passing, however, Congress’s floor leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and DMK’s T R Baalu demanded that the Centre announce a financial bailout package to combat coronavirus before the passage of the bill. The demand was, however, not acceded by Birla. Later in the day, Rajya Sabha too approved the general budget, including the Finance Bill, and returned it to the lower House.Sitharaman also introduced a provision to expand the scope of equalisation levy — a tax on digital transactions — to non-resident ecommerce operators. “The tax rate has been fixed at 2% and the obligation will be on non-resident e-commerce operators themselves to pay this levy at the end of each quarter and applies with effect from April 1, 2020,” said Amit Maheshwari, managing partner Ashok Maheshwary & Associates.

West Bengal government had sought help from hoteliers to arrange room for their self-isolation on Sunday. The health and tourism departments of the government have asked HRAEI to request their members to give rooms for this purpose.

President of HRAEI, Parnav Singh, said that in the next few days it can arrange for more rooms. “A lot of hotels are willing to give rooms for this purpose but the main problem is shortage of staff. But we should find more rooms shortly,” he added.

Singh pointed out that it has already informed the state government about the room arrangement. “From Tuesday, people will come for self- isolation in these hotel rooms,” he added. HRAEI secretary Sudesh Poddar earlier said that HRAEI has always shown the grit and followed the path of responsible corporate citizen and supported the society that sustains them. “It’s time again to prove ourselves to be a body that cares and supports the society from where we have been taking for ages,” HRAEI secretary wrote to the members in a letter on March 22 evening

Poddar also pointed out that all the members who have already agreed to give rooms are ready to offer this facility on cost-to-cost basis. “The charges will be Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 depending on categories (3-4 star or 5 star) which will include everything like breakfast, lunch and dinner,” he added. Poddar said that there are currently 2,500-2,600 rooms in five star and five-star deluxe categories in the city, while the same for 3-4 star categories will be 2000-plus.

Police said the accused, identified as Yaqub Memon (30), Yusuf Memon (25), Irfan Memon (25), Ismaeel Kumbhar (42) and a 16-year-old accomplice, had tried to break open an ATM of HDFC Bank in Baladia village, but failed.

According to the police, the robbers arrived at the spot in a car and one of the robbers overpowered the ATM security guard, Nilesh Khokhani (24) first. “The other three got inside the kiosk and one of the robbers smashed the screen of the CCTV camera, while the others started breaking the machine with an iron rod. However, the ATM did not break, and instead the siren started blaring,” said K B Vihol, sub-inspector with Mankuwa police station.

Hearing the siren, Ashoksinh Zala, who lives in the neighbourhood, along with other villagers rushed to the spot. However, by then the accused had already sped away in their car. The villagers then alerted Mankuwa police station whose officials rushed to the crime spot.

Meanwhile, a villager told the police that he had seen four persons abandoning their car and fleeing towards Bhuj. “As they could not get a lift from any vehicles passing on the road, the accused were walking. We went after them in our vehicle along with some villagers on their bike and caught the accused near Vadzar village on the outskirts of Bhuj,” added Vihol.

With Section 144 of the CrPc to be in effect from Tuesday evening (6 pm), official sources said that they are yet to decide on the functioning of the ITeS companies in the city, either to close the firms or to let them operate with a minimal workforce.

An employee of an ITeS firm at Cantonment said, “There are about 300 employees in my company working in two different shifts. Despite the scare, our organisation is silent about letting us work from home.” Several ITeS firms were blamed for not implementing the social distancing practices. With the government announced the curfew, the employees are clueless about whether they should come to the office or can go to their native places near Trichy . The employees were also hesitant in enquiring with their management fearing a backlash.

A few ITeS companies mentioning their operational restrictions had said that work from home option for them is highly impossible. “Dongles ( wireless internet service provider ) is difficult to source now. Despite the difficulties, we have permitted around 70 employees to work from home in Trichy,” A R Yogandran, managing director of Trichy-based Fulgent IT Solutions said.

Elcot sources said that the proposed lockdown has provisions for ITeS firms to operate with minimal staff and with all protective measures till March 31. “Transport services of ITeS companies are likely to be exempted from section 144. We are still discussing whether to insist the companies close their operations or work with minimal staff,” an official source said.

A day after the city observed the self-imposed Janata Curfew by staying indoors, people in large numbers, mostly youth, preferred to wander around on their bikes and hang out at tea stalls, many discussing the funny memes on Covid-19. With non-essential outlets too opening on Monday, cautious residents now pin their hopes on section 144 of CrPC coming into effect on Tuesday evening to prevent gathering at public spots.

The authorities had urged the traders to cooperate with the government by refraining from doing business that attracts crowds till March 31. But, around 11 am on Monday, even fashion retail outlets started opening their shutters and customers carelessly thronging them. Mobile and car showrooms as well as second-hand two-wheeler sales showrooms were seen open for business despite the restrictions.

With school and colleges ordered to be closed, youths were seen roaming in their two-wheeler, many riding in triples. “We have been repeatedly insisting on the youths to stay indoors but they are in no mood to oblige. They have not understood the seriousness of the Covid-19 outbreak,” a police officer patrolling Cantonment locality said.

Among those who ventured out to Thillai Nagar and Palakkarai roads were youths heading to mobile and computer accessories shops that were kept open. The city seemed to be completely unaware of the potential infection threat it faces with the local people interacting and travelling at a very close distance. “Residents should cooperate with the authorities, we all have the responsibility of combating the viral infection,” M Sekaran, a social worker said. Neither the police nor the district administration, despite being alerted, bothered to enquire with textile showrooms why they were kept open inviting the public.

All components of the tax revenue indicated a higher growth in 2018-19, except for VAT (petrol, diesel, liquor, etc), taxes on Vehicles and other taxes & duties on goods & services (entertainment tax, luxury tax, etc).The government is expecting a tax collection of Rs 44,100 crore in 2020-21.The survey revealed that Delhi government had debt under control. The outstanding debt stood at Rs 29,608.3 crore in 2011-12, which was equal to 8.6% of the GSDP then. In 2018-19, with an outstanding debt of Rs 32,732 crore as on March 31, 2019, the debt-to-GSDP ratio had declined substantially to 4.2%. This has helped Delhi to maintain a consistent revenue surplus, which was calculated at Rs 6,261 crore in 2018-19 compared with Rs 4,913 crore in 2017-18.Being in the black allowed the state government to make fund allocations to different sectors and plan and implement various public welfare schemes. In the financial year 2019-20, education had been the priority sector for the government with a maximum share of the budgetary allocations at 28.9%, followed by housing & urban development (14.5%), medical and public health (13.9%) and transport (13.7%)According to the Delhi Economic Survey, the capital’s infant mortality and neonatal mortality rates are below the national-level averages.

409,['24/03/2020'],"Lockdown in Kolkata: Delivery continues, but food options shrink","Online food delivery services do not come under the purview of the lockdown

KOLKATA: Even though app-based home delivery services continued to operate through a ‘truncated partner network’, Kolkatans looking to order food were left disappointed on Monday as more than 80% of the restaurants shut their kitchens down. With a state government notification seeking closure of all eateries till March 31, food options have shrunk despite availability of delivery services.

The Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) — one of the parent bodies of restaurants in Kolkata — claimed it was not feasible for most to keep kitchens running just for delivery. The restaurant industry in the state is staring at a loss of Rs 100 crore a day, according to the HRAEI.

Restaurants on the city’s food hub — Park Street — have been hit hard. All have closed their kitchens completely. “It would have been unfeasible to keep the kitchen open. Ensuring hygiene would be a challenge now and we are not willing to take any chance,” said Nitin Kothari, owner of Mocambo and Peter Cat.

HRAEI secretary Sudesh Poddar said food orders have plunged despite online delivery services remaining open. “Delivery orders alone can’t sustain eateries. They merely supplement the business. Other than those who depend primarily on delivery services, the rest will find it difficult to keep kitchens running,” said Poddar. He added that delivery orders, too, have plummeted since people are wary of ordering restaurant food.

Most restaurants have gone into a complete shutdown and staffers have been asked to go on leave. “I have asked my staff and cooks to go on leave. As of now, they are on a paid leave for I want them to stay safe and financially secure. But if this continues for an inordinately long period, we don’t know what it will lead to,” said Kothari. Another restaurant owner said he is already contemplating layoffs and leave without pay since sales have stopped.

There were some, though, who continued to run their kitchens much to the delight of foodies. Take the case of Sanjha Chulha, which has kept just one base kitchen operational on Puddapukur from where its own fleet of delivery boys and aggregators Zomato and Swiggy are rushing off to all parts of the city. “There is a 100% jump in home delivery orders overnight and it’s growing,” said Asif Ahmed, spokesperson. “We are flooded with delivery requests and we are trying our best. The option of contactless delivery, where the boy leaves the food at your doorstep and you pay online, has also come in,” explained Sagar Daryani, owner of Wow! Momo.

Bengali speciality restaurant, 6, Ballygunj Place was flooded with home delivery inquiries too and so it decided to give a 25% discount in all its three restaurants. Those who live in the vicinity and chose to hop across to carry food home got a 50% discount, said spokesperson Dibyajyoti Chaudhuri.

Online food delivery services said they would operate since they are exempt from the lockdown. “We will continue to operate with a truncated partner network (restaurants and delivery executives) for those in need of food,” said a Zomato spokesperson.

Ill-advised vigilantism can end up causing as many problems as irresponsible behaviour by people who should be in quarantine or home isolation.

KOLKATA: A team of Howrah Muncipal Corporation’s health workers had to be shown a live video call to make them believe that the Shibpur resident Titas Chowdhury was still in Abu Dhabi and had not returned home. A police team had to visit the complex, Diamond City West, in Behala for the second time to convince people that one of its residents, who had returned from Europe on March 2, served out the quarantine period. Research scholar Prosenjit Majumdar, a Garia resident, took to the Kolkata Police’s Facebook page and complained that he was being hounded by local club members and neighbours, despite following all quarantine norms after returning from the UK.Some people, who had returned to the city from abroad much before the coronavirus outbreak, alleged harassment by locals. The residents demanded fitness certificates from ID Hospital at Beliaghata from these returnees.“I am a research scholar at a UK university. I came back home four months ago — on November 25. On Sunday, I faced humiliation and life threat from one of the local club members who told me, ‘Tell us whether you had returned from London yesterday, otherwise we will pick you up from home and thrash you’. Although I repeatedly told him that I had come back long before the outbreak of coronavirus, he did not listen. Do I deserve this? Now, I and my family members are scared to step out of home. So, I request for urgent help,” he wrote on the Kolkata Police’s Facebook page.Gautam Chowdhury, husband of Titas, said some neighbours had complained against them deliberately. “She had to make a video call to prove that she was in Abu Dhabi.”A resident of the Behala complex, who wished to withhold his name, had returned from Europe on March 2. “He had served his quarantine period. On Sunday, we visited the complex twice as neighbours claimed he was not following the protocol. Yet, he was still being hounded by locals after home-quarantine,” said an IPS officer from the Behala division. At Kankurgachi, MMiC (health) Atin Ghosh was shocked to find that the grudge of neighbours staying in that apartment was that an US returnee in quarantine “had dared to step on the balcony”. Ghosh had to explain that there are more than 20-metre distance between that person and his neighbours.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74784359,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-131718,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/locals-harass-people-with-foreign-travel-history/articleshow/74783253.cms

KOLKATA: Driver of a Karma ambulance that serves Kolkata Police allegedly left from a spot in the Bagha Jatin-Ganguly Bagan area when he was asked to take a man, who had returned from Australia recently, to the ID Hospital at Beliaghata on Sunday morning. The incident took place in the presence of officers from Patuli PS.

Locals said the ambulance driver fled the moment he heard that the man, who had been suffering from fever, could be a Covid-19 patient. Finally, cops and local councillor Debasish Mukherjee arranged for an alternative vehicle to send him for a test at the ID Hospital.

Cops said the man, a resident of Ward 99, had returned from Australia on March 18. At airport, he was asked to stay in home quarantine.

On Sunday morning, his neighbours found him moving around on the road, instead of staying in isolation.

Locals alerted the police who called the Karma ambulance. A local said, “The man has been advised home isolation.”

413,['24/03/2020'],Delhi budget 2020-21: Deputy CM Manish Sisodia showcases ‘Arvind Kejriwal model’ in budget,"NEW DELHI: Delhi government will implement the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat health scheme, set up its own education board, reduce air pollution by 66%, open more mohalla and polyclinics and procure new buses, said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday while presenting a Rs 65,000-crore budget for the 2020-21 financial year.Non-implementation of Ayushman Bharat, which promises free treatment of up to Rs 5 lakh annually to the city’s poor, has been a sore point with the Centre since its launch in 2018, with the BJP accusing the latter of depriving the people of Delhi of its benefits.Making his sixth consecutive budget speech and first after AAP was re-elected with a thumping majority in February, Sisodia, who also holds the charge of the finance department, set aside Rs 50 crore to fight the coronavirus epidemic which cast a shadow on the budget too. In a first, the government presented and passed the budget the same day without any discussion or debate in a one-day assembly session.In a series of tweets after the session, Sisodia said the budget had more than doubled since the AAP formed a government in 2015 — from Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 65,000 crore — due to the “Kejriwal model of governance”. He added it was because of the same governance model that for the sixth consecutive year, one-fourth of the budget had been allocated to education.With almost 25% of the budgetary allocation, the education sector got the lion’s share while health, transport and social security and welfare, too, figured as the government’s priorities. Sisodia said that various government subsidies, like free power, water and travel for women in public buses, will continue in the next financial year.While chief minister Arvind Kejriwal didn’t get a chance to speak in the House, he appreciated the budget later in a tweet: “Congratulations to Manish Sisodia ji, finance minister, for presenting a very good budget. It makes provisions for every section of society. It is a concrete step towards making our Delhi a modern and best city in the world,” said Kejriwal.In his budget speech, Sisodia said the government will set up Delhi’s own state board of education with an objective of focusing on understanding and learning rather than scoring marks by rote learning. He also promised to open 145 new schools of excellence besides converting all classrooms from 9th to 12th into hi-tech digital ones.Sisodia also promised more mohalla and polyclinics, upgrading and expansion of existing hospitals, new medical facilities and free treatment and diagnostics under the ‘Mukhaya Mantri Swastha Yojana’ while allocating Rs 7074 crore for the next fiscal. “Making good health services available to the citizens of Delhi is second most integral part of Kejriwal’s model of governance,” Sisodia said.He also allocated Rs 1,700 crore for providing basic facilities in the unauthorised colonies and Rs100 crore for a scheme to rebrand Delhi as a tourist destination.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74784179,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-147764,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-showcases-kejriwal-model-in-budget/articleshow/74783272.cms

Pudukottai collector P Uma Maheswari said village-level teams have been formed to check if those home-quarantined are keeping indoor. Private bus operators and general manager, TNSTC have been asked to run buses only to the seating capacity and avoid congestion. Tiruvarur collector T Anand said they would follow the instruction from the government. Nagapattinam district collector Praveen P Nair said the district administration will ensure that the general public is not inconvenienced by the imposition of curfew.

However, the report card gave 47% to transport and 39% to public works department projects while the urban development department fared slightly better at 50%.

The outcome budget was introduced in 2017-18 as a budgetary tool to regularly measure the progress of various projects for which funds have been allocated. It was expected that the periodic review of performance using the criteria of “on track” and “off track” would prod the departments to try to outdo each other.

The departments submit quarterly reports, which are analysed to take necessary steps to expedite the projects. The move was also aimed at bringing transparency due to periodic checks.

The outcome budget 2019-20 combined all major departments and agencies into eight major sectors and 567 schemes and projects were covered by it.

Of the 209 indicators for the directorate of education, 71% were on track and only 9% off track. Among the schemes was the new entrepreneurship development programme, which benefitted seven lakh school students till December. Another was the happiness curriculum, which has been implemented in all government schools and benefitted alomst 8 lakh students. A total of 54,765 teachers have been given tablets to record attendance of students and exam-related data, and access teaching-leaning material. CCTV cameras are being installed at all government schools. Out of the 728 school buildings, the work has been completed at 254.

For the health department, 77% of the 1,558 indicators were on track. The government has opened 451 mohalla clinics against the target of 530, which have treated 55 lakh patients. In all, 2.1 crore patients availed of healthcare services at 32 Delhi government hospitals between April and December 2019.

The social welfare department has met 78% of the total 230 indicators while the women and child development department has managed to achieve an even better report card with 81% of the 192 indicators being on track.

Delhi Jal Board, which is entrusted with the supply of water, has 59% of the 194 indicators on track. It has connected 1,565 unauthorised colonies with water pipelines till December as compared to 1,374 in 2018-19.

The power department is on track in 64% of the 113 indicators, the environment department in 63% of the 122 indicators and the forest department in 73% of the 105 indicators.

Several projects for constructing flyovers, roads and bus depots got delayed as the Supreme Court extended the ban on the activity in 2019 due to air pollution, a government source claimed.

The outcome budget has helped most departments pinpoint the issues and obstacles and resolve the same in a timely manner, the report stated, adding that inter-departmental coordination had also improved.

With no lockdown option — as that could result in catastrophic mid-air collisions — ATC has prepared a reserve force that will be on standby at their home, ready to be deputed at short notice in an emergency.

“Starting Monday, six controllers will be on reserve and available to report for duty 24×7. This contingency is to ensure that the ATC in Kolkata remains functional even if one member of the team on duty develops Covid-19 symptoms and requires everyone on the shift to be put in home isolation. The reserve force that will then take over the surveillance and navigation of flights from a sanitized and sealed contingency room on the third floor of the ATC building,” a senior ATC official revealed.

Though they have taken social separation measures, there is anxiety over DGCA continuing with breathalyzer tests before controllers report for duty. The Air Traffic Controllers’ Guild has written to both DGCA and the PMO, demanding immediate suspension of the practice that all law enforcement agencies have discontinued in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic as it increases the risk of transmission of the virus. “Even if one controller gets infected due to this, Kolkata ATC will have to shut down,” warned the guild’s Kolkata general secretary Kailash Pati Mandal.

There are 285 controllers in Kolkata. Around 50 are on duty in each shift. They are responsible for the safety of over 2 lakh flyers daily, making it a zero-error margin job that entails huge levels of stress. Together they used to handle around 1,600 flight movements daily till last month. But in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, the number has come down to 1,250. From Wednesday, it is expected to reduce further to 650.

The area control that guides flights heading into and out of the region as well as those passing Kolkata, either on domestic or international routes, currently operates from the fourth floor of the building. In addition, there is a tower control on the eighth floor that guides planes that land and take off from the city.

While prohibitory orders are in place and essential services like grocery, medical stores, hospitals, vegetable markets have been allowed to operate, a large number of people came out of their homes on the pretext of buying essentials.

Taking serious note of this, police plunged into action and dispersed the crowd gathered on the streets.

Police inspector Vijay Dhamal of Mumbai Naka police station said, “People were coming out on streets with their vehicles on pretext of going to grocery stores, medical stores, hospitals. This was creating too much rush on the streets. Thus, we decided to send people back to their homes. People were also found travelling in autorickshaws. However, after our action, rush of people subsided in the afternoon.”

Nakabandi was also in place at Mumbai Naka, Nashik Road, Satpur, Panchavati, and Bhadrakali.

The traffic signals in the city were also shut down to avoid gathering of motorists at the junctions. However, to avoid over-speeding, police had put barricades at the junctions.

More than 20 autorickshaw drivers were booked under Section 188 for violating the prohibition orders.

By evening, most of the rush on the city roads was cleared by police, though the curfew got underway from 7pm onwards. No vehicles other than ambulances and those falling under the essential services were allowed by the police.

A police officer on Monday said that strict action will be taken against people in the future until the curfew was in place.

The post with an audio clip has gone viral in social media.

Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar warned those spreading such fake clips of stringent action under the relevant acts. “Posting and spreading such misleading and irresponsible posts without any basis is an offence. Those posting such content could be booked under various laws and face imprisonment. The administration would take stern action against such rumour mongers,” he said while cautioning the people not to believe in such posts.

Kumar further clarified that only four positive patients have been detected in the district so far and all of them are on the course of recovery.

“Since one week, there is not a single positive case in the city although many suspects have been identified and are being tested daily. Even those coming from neighbouring states like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are arriving here for testing. The government has established state-of-the-art Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) for Covid-19 testing,” he said.

NAGPUR: The upcoming religious festivals will be without the usual celebrations due to restrictions on mass gatherings in the light of coronavirus outbreak.

The city will observe Chaitra Navratri from March 25 but devotees will not be able to visit temples. The worship and celebrations will have to be done only at homes as temples will be not be allowing mass lighting of jyots (lamps), which is the highlight of this pious occasion.

The celebrations will be kept intimate. TOI spoke to a few trustees and organizing members of temples to find out the scenario.

The popular Shiv Mandir at Baileyshop Motibagh, Railway Colony, is known for its procession held on the account of Ramnavami , but the 19th year of this shobha yatra has been called off by the organizing committee. “A big jyot will be lit inside the temple to seek god’s blessing to protect us all from coronavirus, but no celebrations will take place,” said Pravin Dabli, secretary.

The Sarbajanin Basanti Durga puja too has been cancelled this year. Secretary Gautam Chakraborty said they has done all the preparations but now there will be no celebrations, cultural programmes or distribution of mahaprasad.

At Shree Annapurna Mata Mandir at Gol Bazaar Chowk, Gaddigodam, hundreds of lamps are lit each year, but this time there won’t be any celebrations. “We have decided to avoid any kind of mass gathering. The priest performs a small puja in the morning and the temple is kept closed. Same will happen when Chaitra Navratri begins,” said Prassana Kale, president, Annapurna Mata Mandir Trust.

Members of Devi Ahilya Mandir would observe fast and offer prayers to the goddess in the morning. Like every year, the temple will be cleaned and the idol decorated, but there will be no mass lighting of lamps or mahaprasad. “Fasting and preparation of bhog must be done by the devotees at their houses only. This year no arrangements have been made for group celebrations, bhajan or prasad,” said Poonam Gupta .

The Agyaram Devi Mandir at Ganeshpeth, which is thronged by hundreds of devotees during this time every year, is known for lighting thousands of jyots and beautifully decorated idol of the goddess. This year, however, no celebrations will be held at the temple.

The Shitla Mata Mandir at Jaripatka, which witnesses long queues of devotees for offering prayers, would wear a pale look this year during Chaitra Navratri. “A small puja would take place at the temple. Ghatsthapna will be done by trustees and members of the temple. No devotees will be allowed inside,” said advocate Vilas Bhande , president of temple’s charitable trust.

Anandrao Marbate, a resident living near the famous Shitla Mata Mandir at Shree Krishna Nagar, said that every year, people look forward to the decoration at the temple, mahaprasad and celebrations. “This time, there won’t be any celebrations because life is more important than festivities at the moment,” he said.

If the visitor has to meet some relative or friend in the building, the person has to use the sanitizer, then make an entry in visitors book before using a separate lift accessed by visitors only,'' she said.Dube said members have a different lift, but even they have to use sanitizers every time they enter. “We also have sanitizers at the doorstep of most flats and many families have asked maids and caretakers to stay home and not visit till March 31,” he said.He further said senior citizens, women and children have been asked to stay indoors and refrain from stepping out. “There is a poster which creates awareness among building members asking them not to gather in a group, keep a metre distance as far as possible and what to do to prevent Corona,” another member of the 10-year-old housing society told TOI which visited the society on Friday.Meanwhile, local MLA Mihir Kotecha said residents of Mulund have reacted with “maturity” on learning that a local tested positive. “Five others from Mulund who have come from US and London are now strictly following self-quarantine,” Kotecha said.

NEW DELHI: Education accounts for nearly a quarter of Delhi government ’s budget for 2020-21, with the allocation for the sector going up from Rs 15,601 crore in the previous budget to Rs 15,815, or 24.3% of the total. From the budget speech Manish Sisodia , it is evident that the priority is now on quality, with Rs 62 crore demarcated for “radical changes in curriculum” and for the setting up of Delhi’s own state education board.

The budget also promises to convert all classroom in secondary and senior secondary schools into digital ones over five years, while proposing to establish two new universities.

The key proposal on Delhi’s own education board means government-run and government-aided schools could soon be out of the ambit of Central Board of Secondary Education. “Our government believes that education should play a guiding role in society. This is possible only when we connect education with the contemporary needs of the society and the possibilities of tomorrow… There must be radical changes from our everyday life to technologies,” said Sisodia.

For this, he proposed two new initiatives, work for which will start from the next financial year. “The first is to make radical changes in the curriculum. An expert committee is being formed for this which will include eminent scholars from both government and private institutions,” he said. “Another important proposal in this direction is establishment of Delhi's own ‘State Board of Education’. The aim of the new board is to establish a system of education and examination in which children focus on learning rather than score marks by rote learning.”

As usual under AAP government, education continues to bag the lion’s share of the state budget. Though it came down in percentage terms from last year’s 26%, in absolute terms the sectoral allocation for 2020-21 went up by Rs 214 crore. Sisodia underlined the importance of education when he claimed, “Delhi government is the only government in the country that has been spending about one-fourth of its total budget in the education sector during the last five years.”

As part of the continuing modernisation of government schools, Sisodia proposed to begin construction of 17 new school buildings at a cost of Rs 175 crore in 2020-21. The budget also set aside Rs 100 crore for digital classrooms in secondary and senior secondary government schools. In 2020-21, 10 classrooms in each school will become digital classrooms.

Regimes like the Pinarayi Vijayan government in India’s second worst-hit state Kerala —which had dithered on the Centre’s directive to lock down 10 affected districts just 24 hours ago — also decided to follow other states on Monday by ordering complete shutdown of the state till March 31.

Also, the use of private vehicles, taxis and autorickshaws will be restricted only to the extent of procuring essential commodities, health services and other emergency reasons,” he said.Only one person besides the driver will be allowed in private vehicles. Justifying the strict measures while referring to the ‘janata curfew’ on Sunday for which PM Modi had given a call, Thackeray said, “We are putting these restrictions only for some time and for the benefit of the state.By beating thalis we have not killed the virus, this is aturning point in the fight against this virus.” The CM said that most religious places have shut their doors to visitors “and the ones which haven’t will also be shut from today”.

Our goal in the next five years is to reduce it by two-thirds,” Manish Sisodia said.An allocation of Rs 20 crore has been made for campaigns, including segregation of waste at home, avoiding single-use plastic, rooftop plantation, use of public transportation and carpooling, cycling for short distances, using jute and cloth bags, preventing waste of paper, celebrations in eco-friendly ways, and holding conferences on environmental issues. “To encourage citizens to contribute for environmental protection and preservation work, Green Citizen Awards will be instituted,” Sisodia said.Also, Rs 2 crore has been set aside for environment marshals and Rs 30 crore for pollution control and environment management under which smog towers will be installed.Lauding the pollution reduction target, Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, tweeted: “It is encouraging to see Delhi government setting a target for reducing air pollution by two-third in next five years. Hope this will now quicken implementation of upscaled action on public transport, walking & cycling, waste management, clean energy.”This is also the first time that the Kejriwal government has given a dedicated budget for the environment department. In previous budgets, including in 2018 when the first-ever green budget to reduce air pollution in the city was placed, allocations were made to other departments like transport, PWD and power.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74786076,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-108631,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dedicated-rs-52cr-budget-for-environment-department/articleshow/74783357.cms
449,['24/03/2020'],Laptop Bhagya: Karnataka govt blames falling rupee and GST for spike in price,"TimesView The BJP government’s claim that the GST regime, falling rupee and market inflation have all acted to almost double the prices of laptops may hold some truth, but it’s clear that all is not well with the procurement process. When corruption has become so commonplace — across parties of all political stripes — it is good that the deputy CM has taken it up to prove no irregularity was involved. However, rhetorical statements are not enough and the party must be able to demonstrate this clearly. And even if things were above board, the scheme could have been revisited when it was clear that costs were soaring.

BENGALURU: With opposition parties exerting pressure on the BJP government over the alleged laptop procurement scam, the latter has defended the purchase by blaming the changing financial circumstances in the country.This includes the new GST regime, falling rupee and market inflation, which it says spiked the prices by more than Rs 13,000 per laptop. Initially priced at Rs 14,920 per piece in 2016-17, the gadgets were purchased for Rs 28,320 each in 2019-20.Last week, opposition leader Siddaramaiah had said in the assembly that the government “overpaid” Rs 145 crore to procure over 1 lakh laptops under the Laptop Bhagya scheme . He demanded investigation by an impartial authority.Higher education minister and deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan said it was nothing more than a political “hit-and-run” allegation by Congress. “There is no truth to the allegation and we will prove it on the floor of the house,” he said.The higher education department has claimed a technical committee headed by the additional chief secretary of the department, director of collegiate education and senior technical personnel from ISRO, LRDE and IIIT Bengaluru had approved the steep rise in the rates.The department has claimed the committee justified the increase under four heads: the rates in 2019-20 were subject to 18 per cent GST vis-a-vis the 5 per cent VAT in 2016-17; the falling rate of rupee against the dollar in the last fiscal; addition of licenced software for students and a three-year warranty for the laptops as opposed to one year previously.But Congress appears to be convinced the decision to buy the gadgets at an increased price was not justified. According to a Congress functionary privy to cabinet meetings of the previous coalition government, the finance department had vetoed the purchase of laptops citing the huge overheads.“As a result, the proposal was deferred twice and cleared at the last cabinet meeting when former CM HD Kumaraswamy prevailed upon the department and allowed higher education minister GT Deve Gowda to tender the procurement,” alleged the Congressman, blaming both the coalition and the BJP government for the scam.The scheme was launched by the Congress government in 2016-17, with then higher education minister Basavaraj Rayareddi finalising the rates.“We ordered 39,000 laptops for SC/ST students. In 2017-18, the scheme was expanded to all castes and communities but was not launched full fledgedly. I can assure you there is not much difference between the specifications in the gadgets procured then and those purchased now at such an inflated cost,” claimed Rayareddi, providing an invoice from a dealer for the same configuration laptop at almost the same price, Rs 14,700 + GST.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74784233,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-548793,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/laptop-bhagya-govt-blames-falling-rupee-and-gst-for-spike-in-price/articleshow/74782640.cms

Banking services have been kept out of the purview of curfew still the ATMs of several nationalised banks in city went dry. Mahesh Gosavi, deputy general secretary of State Bank of India Staff Union (Mumbai circle), said due to Sunday’s janata curfew the teams could not replenish the ATMs.

He, however, added that proper system of alerting the local branches on ensuring cash in ATMs is in place. If an ATM’s capacity is Rs 30 lakh, the teams are alerted by the Mumbai head office as soon as the cash goes down below Rs 10 lakh.

“It has also been observed that some people are engaging in panic cash withdrawal. Fearing lack of cash availability these people end up withdrawing large sums of money causing the ATMs to go dry. However, they should be rest assured because banking is an essential service,” Gosavi said.

Meanwhile, banks are also taking several steps to avoid crowding on their premises. State Bank of India, with around 200 branches across Marathwada, has appealed to its customers to make use of its digital platforms.

A notification placed at the entry of the zonal branch of the SBI in Cidco states that customers should avoid bank visits for less important works like updating passbooks and avoid bringing other person with them.

The bank has instructed the visitors to use sanitisers placed at the entry gate, to cover the face with masks and handkerchiefs and to maintain distance from the counter.

The SBI branches at Jadhavwadi, Harsul, Rozabagh, Ramdas Tower and Waluj are the ones that witness highest number of visitors. “As senior citizens are most vulnerable to Covid-19, we request them to avoid unnecessary visits to the bank and use ATMs for cash withdrawal, mini statement and passbook printing,” Gosavi said.

Devidas Tuljapurkar, joint secretary of All India Bank Employees’ Association, said the association has asked all member banks, regional and circle heads of the banks to take a decision on the business continuity plan after consultation with respective district and civic administrations.

According to civic body officials, most of the revenue is collected in March-end, which is now being stopped due to the lockdown.To save revenue losses, JMC officials are demanding that the government must extend the financial year from March 30 to April 30. JMC sources said a letter had been sent to the government, but no decision had been made as yet.Officials were able to collect around Rs 70 crore of urban development tax before the lockdown. Around Rs 20 crore tax is usually collected at the end of March as urban development tax and marriage garden license fees.Deputy commissioner (Revenue) Naveen Bhardhwaj said, “Our regular depositors usually deposit tax in the end. We have identified some new properties that were taxable, but none of owners has deposited it. With restrictions on outsiders in JMC, it will be impossible for them to do anything. This will take a toll on revenue collection this year.”Marriage garden license fees was increased from Rs 10 per sq-metre to Rs 20 per sq-metre. This was challenged by the marriage garden association to higher authorities. Till the matter was solved, owners were paying Rs 10 per sq-metre rates. The matter was finally resolved after two years as the government refused to lower the rates. Now marriage garden owners were supposed to pay higher price due for the last two years along with the penalty of Rs 100 per day.However, the government gave them relief by letting them pay fees without penalty if marriage garden owners submit fees before March 30.

One, without interstate movement, it’s impossible to deliver orders. Two, the definition of essential items needs to be simple and uniform for everyone, so we don’t face different issues in different states,” said an ecommerce executive.As more cities locked down or extended the curbs on movement introduced over the weekend, deliveries of groceries and vegetables through Amazon Pantry and Amazon Fresh halted on Monday.

Understanding the situation in Germany, Varun was ready for a hospital quarantine when he reached the airport. Unlike in Germany or Abu Dhabi where he couldn’t find any screening, Varun was surprised to see over a 20-member screening team at Trivandrum international airport. “The first thing they asked me was whether I had eaten. I was overwhelmed by their sensitive approach. I was in fact stranded for 8 hours at Abu Dhabi airport and was really hungry. They provided me tea and snacks, which was reserved for them,” said the 35-year-old techie.Before reaching the state, Varun had sent his aged parents and child to their ancestral home. As the doctor advised home quarantine, he asked his wife to shift to her colleague’s house before his arrival. “My wife stocked all necessary items before shifting. She brings milk and other items at regular intervals and places it near the gate. I collect it once she leaves,” he said.Varun said that he is surprised to get around five calls a day from the health department. “Some calls are to enquire whether I have developed any symptoms, which I have not. I also got calls from the psychological wing under the department to check whether I was experiencing any kind of stress, sleeplessness or depression. They would advise me to listen to music or watch films. A police officer from Museum station rang me to ask if I need any essential items and they are ready to help. All these experiences make me determined to continue the 28-day quarantine period,” he said.Varun said that being a person who enjoys cooking, he never felt anything stressful about home quarantine. However, the reports of possible lockdown have worried him. “I always prefer stay updated and would check news often. So when reports of lockdown came, I was worried as my wife had to be shifted to our hometown.

The handwashing station was developed as part of the social initiative of the institute.“Already, we have received enquiries from police department and many local-body institutions. We can also train students of ITIs or other technical training institutions to manufacture the units so that it can be mass deployed in this crucial hour,” he added.He said that one has to be careful while washing hands in conventional hand washing stations put up in public places as it involves touching the surface of taps and dispensers.“The automated contactless handwashing station avoids surface contact and also provides the status of the handwashing liquid and water in it so that timely refills can be done,” he said, adding that the unit has low power consumption and can be powered with solar energy.",kozhikode,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/nielit-develops-contactless-automated-handwash-units/articleshow/74782619.cms

463,['24/03/2020'],Govt bans domestic flights till March 31,"Mumbai: The Indian government on Monday announced a seven-day ban from Tuesday midnight on all domestic air travel across all airports in the country in an effort to contain the spread of Covid-19. Among flights banned are domestic passenger airline flights, charter aircraft flights and private aircraft flights. International passenger flights have already been banned for a week, till March 29.

The ban will be enforced from 11.59pm on March 24 and will continue till 11.59pm on March 31, said an order issued by the ministry of civil aviation. Only aircrafts belonging to the state or union government, those engaged in medical evacuation, those with special permission from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and freighter flights carrying cargo within India and from abroad will be arriving and departing Indian airports from Wednesday. It’s the first time in the eleven-decades long history of Indian commercial aviation that cities won’t have commercial air link for passenger transport.

For passengers booked on flights scheduled this week, the ban would mean rescheduling their travel. a travel agent said, “Most airlines are not giving refunds. They give you credit for the same value which you can use in the future. You can use for a different route too, but the passenger has to be the same. There is no change fee applicable obviously. The only amount payable would be a difference in air fare, wherever applicable.’’

The big problem for passengers though would be reaching the airlines customer care. Given the rush, airlines have been asking passengers to reach out to them on social media, some have opened other avenues for communication like sending a support request through an online form, following which airlines would respond to queries based on dates of travel.

On Monday evening, airfares for one-way travel from Mumbai to Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad on Tuesday morning and afternoon flights continued to be stable with cheapest fare ranging between Rs 5,000-6,000, except in case of Hyderabad and Bengaluru which were cheaper at an average of Rs 4,000. But Mumbai-Kochi and Mumbai-Kolkata fares jumped with the cheapest one-way ticket for travel on Tuesday morning starting at Rs 10,000 and Rs 11,000 respectively.

Among those hit due to the air travel ban are youngsters who work in cities and plan to fly back home for self-quarantine, elderly and people who planned an early summer holiday. ``Four months ago, my parents bought Duronto tickets to travel from Mumbai to Kolkata on March 31. After railway cancelled its train, we booked air tickets for March 26, only to find out that’s being cancelled to. But I’m relieved that they do not have to go to an airport now,’’ said Nivedita Ghosh (name changed), expressing concerns about contracting the virus during airport travel.

What the ban also means for airlines is finding parking bays for the 650-odd aircraft that Indian carriers operate. ``Passengers booked on late-night Tuesday flights to airports like Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru might find airlines moving their flights ahead by a few hours as airline would want to operate the last flight to an airport like Ahmedabad, Nagpur etc where they can park the aircraft for a weeks’ time,’’ said an airline official.

The ban comes at a time when air traffic and passenger traffic have already dwindled in major airports like Delhi, Mumbai. Mumbai airport, for instance, used to handle 950 arrivals and departures a day, handled an average of about 550 flight movements this week. Passenger traffic too has dropped by about 55 % in the past few week. Nevertheless, the complete suspension of domestic flights is expected to hit about 25,000-30,000 passengers per day in Mumbai alone, according to conservative estimates.

The discussion on a possible ban on domestic passenger flights began on Sunday as a number of state governments mulled over the decision with the state government in Bihar taking the first initiative. Currently, passengers booked on flights scheduled from April 1 onwards need not worry about flight status, though given the volatile situation, the ban on air travel might be extended if the rate of corona positive cases increases exponentially this week.

VIJAYAWADA: The state government has exempted from the lockdown the e-commerce delivery of all essential goods including food, pharmaceutical and medical equipment and home delivery from restaurants and hotels.

Even as a majority of residents stayed indoors on Monday, markets and shops in the city remained overcrowded. Doorstep delivery of food and other essential commodities proved to be a lifeline for students and working professionals staying alone in rented accommodations.

Several also opted for the e-commerce route to order groceries from home instead of from brick-and-mortar stores.

Speaking to TOI, M Subash, a representative of a popular food delivery aggregator said they introduced contactless delivery as a measure against the spread of Covid-19. “The consumers can avail the option of contactless delivery while ordering their food. The delivery boy will leave the order at the doorstep of the buyer in a clean environment. Even the boys are provided with masks and other safety equipment,” added Subash.

Officials across the state, including at the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC), closed several non-essential commercial shops on Monday. Several well-known brands and chains of retail stores were among shops found flouting lockdown norms.

VMC commissioner V Prasanna Venkatesh said they will bring commercial establishments to book if they are found violating rules. “The representatives of these shops should voluntarily come forward and augment the efforts of the personnel involved in the essential services of the municipal corporation. Even the establishments and organisations which were allowed to run their operations should take necessary measures while dealing with the public,” said Venkatesh.

BENGALURU: Karnataka, which is racing to increase the number of diagnostic centres, received a vital boost as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Sunday allowed a private lab in Shivajinagar here to conduct Covid-19 tests.

Neuberg Anand Reference Laboratory is now the sixth facility in the state which can check samples for coronavirus. The other five: National Institute of Virology on the campus of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, Mysore Medical College and Research Institute, Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences, and Shimoga Institute of Medical Sciences.

Two more labs, in Kalaburagi and Hubballi, are awaiting ICMR clearance. Command Hospital in Bengaluru is also likely to start Covid-19 tests soon.

“The current crisis is a once-in-a-century global pandemic. We have not seen community outbreak in India yet. But if that happens, available facilities in Karnataka won’t be enough,” said Dr Manju Bansal, a member of the ICMR scientific advisory board and a senior scientist at the molecular biophysics unit of the Indian Institute of Science. “Testing is critical in terms of containing the virus spread, and for that, we need more labs.”

As on Monday, Karnataka had tested 1,477 samples. The rate of 10 tests per million people is better than the count of other big states, but it is far behind that of South Korea, which has tested over 5,000 people per million citizens, highest in the world.

Chief minister BS Yediyurappa said he wanted to raise the rate to 200 tests per million citizens. But this may be difficult with available infrastructure. The central government has said it plans to increase the number of Covid-16 testing labs in the country from 50 to 111.

“Karnataka has conducted the highest number of tests in the country, but we think the numbers are low. We want to do 1 lakh tests, but we have technical and practical problems. The reagent required for the test has to come from Germany and there is not enough supply. Three T’s — tracing, testing and treatment — are crucial,” said medical education minister K Sudhakar.

“With people getting infected through primary contacts increasing, asymptomatic people will also have to be examined. More labs are required,” said Dr Shashidhar Buggi, former director, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases.

Vegetables such as beans are sold for Rs 100 per kg, Rs 25 higher than Saturday. However, the price of country vegetables has remained unchanged on Monday.

The general public expected that normalcy would be restored late on Sunday, as the curfew was earlier planned till 9 pm. But, it was extended till 5 am on Monday.

Usually, vegetables from the hilly places would be transported to various places from late night to deliver early the next day. But, the extension of the curfew has halted every activity. This has led to a spike in vegetable prices, traders said.

K Rajamani, a resident of Woraiyur, said that the curfew was announced only till 9 pm on Sunday. Expecting that the shops and vegetable markets would function on Monday, he purchased veggies only for two days on Friday.

“All the markets started functioning on Monday, but a few vegetable varieties coming from the hilly areas such as beans and broad beans are sold at higher prices. In Woraiyur market one kg of beans was sold at Rs 110 and carrot Rs 50,” Rajamani said.

S Jegadeesan, a wholesale vegetable trader at Gandhi Market, said poor supply of vegetables from Ooty and Kodaikanal has led to price rise. We procure beans for Rs 100, broad bean for Rs 95, carrot for Rs 40, cabbage for Rs 25 per kg, he told TOI.

LUDHIANA: Despite staring at losses worth several hundred crores, city businessmen are extending full cooperation to the lockdown announced by the government and paying salaries before time. They are also giving advance to their workers to help them survive during the lockdown period.

The businessmen are estimating lockdown losses between Rs 500 crore and Rs 1,000 crore. Rahul Ahuja , chairman of the Confederation of Indian Industry , Punjab unit, said, “Today we have shut down our units till March 31. To help workers survive the tough time, we are providing monetary assistance and paying salaries before time. Punjab’s industry will have to incur huge losses, but we are fully supportive as it’s in the best interest of the people and the country. As per our estimate, Ludhiana’s micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) industry will suffer losses between Rs 1,200 and Rs 1,500 crore, while total loss of Punjab’s industry would be around Rs 3,200 crore during these seven days. It’s likely the losses will be higher.”

Ahuja added, “What is worse is that the lockdown might be extended till April 4 or even beyond that. If both the state and the centre do not step in time by announcing relief packages, businessmen will go bankrupt and livelihoods of lakhs of people will be affected.”

Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), said, “Despite closing its units and facing losses, the business fraternity of Ludhiana is looking after the welfare of its workers to help them in this tough period. This is an unprecedented emergency situation. Curfew is necessary for controlling this pandemic, but lockdown losses are anticipated at Rs 1,500 to Rs 1,600 crore in just one week only for the MSME sector, and it may climb further.”

According to Amit Juneja, chairman of CII, Ludhiana, “It is a tough time for everyone, especially industrialists who not only have the responsibility of earning their bread and butter but also looking after the livelihood of others and contributing to government’s revenue. We can only request the entire business fraternity to support the government during the lockdown. The governments, both of the state and the Centre, should assure special packages to compensate for our losses.”

Don’t look for shortcuts: CII chief

Punjab CII chief Rahul Ahuja appealed to Punjab’s traders and industries to observe complete shutdown to battle Covid-19 and remain indoors. He said, “Ever since Monday morning, I have been flooded with calls from businessmen across the state who are asking about ways of running their factories for a few hours or on alternate days. I urged them to consider this situation as a national emergency and for the sake of their families and others not look at shortcuts to run their factories even for one hour. We will ensure that government steps in to help us.”

DEHRADUN/MUSSOORIE: With educational institutions being directed to remain shut by the state government in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, some schools in the state are initiating online learning classes for their students so that they are able to complete the syllabus of the current academic year on time.

In Dehradun, The Doon School has started conducting online classes . The students of the school are connecting to their teachers via video conferencing apps and the classes go on for around 4-5 hours every day.

“We started with online classes last week and so far, it is going well. The students connect to their teachers via video-conferencing apps and assignments are sent online. Most of the video-conferencing sessions start after 9:30 am and end by around 2:30 pm. Students of Classes VII, VIII, IX, X, and XII are participating in these classes. Class XI students haven’t joined the sessions yet as they have just finished their board exams,” said Piyush Malviya, director of public affairs at The Doon School.

Officials of Welham Boys’ School told TOI that they, too, will start with their online classes in the coming days.

In Mussoorie , St George’s College has also launched online classes for their students. Brother Tomy Varghese , principal of St George’s College, told TOI that the step has been taken as the curriculum of students is being affected due to the closure of schools.

“Our students already have electronic tablets for study purposes and we are sharing courseware, notes and other information for students on their tablets,” Brother Varghese informed. He added that the teachers were also being provided training for online classes.

Similarly, principals of other schools like Woodstock School and Wynberg Allen School are considering online classes, according to the notices sent to students by these schools. However, officials of the schools could not be contacted for confirmation.

LUDHIANA: Chemists in the city are saying that while they want the mask prices to come down, the manufacturers are selling those at exorbitant prices. With wholesalers selling mask N95 for Rs 180, the retailers are further selling it with a margin of 10% at Rs 200.

Sandeep Malhotra, owner of Payal Medical Hall, DMCH said, “Masks are not available with the wholesalers as well because of the high rates. Now, we do not have 2-ply and 3-ply masks, which we are supposed to sell for around Rs 10, the rate fixed by the government. Their wholesale price, however, varies from Rs 13 to Rs 17. We only have N95 masks that we are selling for Rs 150, the lowest. The price of N95 masks varies from retailer to retailer.”

A chemist said, “It is not possible to sell it below the MRP when we have purchased it at hardly 10% less than the MRP. Manufacturers should be told to lower the rates. The government needs to intervene and look into the demand and supply.”

President of the Ludhiana District Chemist Association and general secretary of the Punjab Chemist Association Gurinder Singh Chawla from GBS Pharmaceuticals , Pinddi Gali, said, “We have invested, and now we have to sell at a fixed price. Manufacturers should give us products at a reasonable rate. We can bear the expenses one time, but in future, we won’t purchase, and this may lead to shortage of masks and sanitisers. This is a national calamity and they should not think about profit.”

Sources said it was presumed that monthly requirement of masks in the district before January 2020 was one lakh at the rate of Rs 1.30 with wholesaler and Rs 1.50 at retailer’s end. This included doctors engaged in operations and persons handling contagions and hazardous materials. “But ever since the Covid-19 situation, everyone is buying masks. Now probably the demand has increased more than 20 times in the city,” they added.

Kulvinder Singh, drugs zonal licensing authority, said, “Shop owners will have to review the prices. Even as they had purchased two days ago from manufacturers at higher prices, they will have to sell at controlled rates as the government has notified these items under the Essential Commodities Act.”

No mask for medical staff

Doctors, nurses and Class IV employees at civil hospital complained of shortage of masks and other safety gear, which was putting them and their co-workers at risk. This despite the government assurances that the supply gaps were being addressed by policy fixes and donations from good Samaritans.

Three days ago, a chemist association and NGOs, Mission Smile and Women Next Door, had distributed 3,000 masks at civil hospital. A visit to the hospital revealed that an official at the medical counter was not wearing a mask. When questioned, he said, “Neither masks nor sanitisers were provided by the health department. We are scared, but the department is showing no concern.”

Senior medical officer Ravi Dutt said, “We have provided masks and sanitisers to them.” When prodded further, he said, “I am in a meeting, so cannot talk now.”

But nothing is really helping residents, who want to approach the administration and health department for issues related to coronavirus An incident has come to light in which a resident had to approach the police after they found the house of a couple under home quarantine locked. On approaching the police, it was found that the couple had gone to their relative’s house outside Ludhiana.A middle-aged couple from a locality on Gill Road had recently returned from Dubai. They were directed to go for home quarantine. However, on Sunday some residents found their house locked and called up the area police to inform about the same.ASI Ashwani Kumar, in-charge, Marado police post, said, “The police were in touch with the couple. They were asked for self- quarantine. When I received a complaint from a locality resident, I called up the couple. They told that they had gone to some relative’s house outside the city. I immediately asked them to return else face action.”On Monday, the couple returned home. A sticker of home quarantine has been posted outside their house.Chief medical officer Rajesh Bagga said, “We have a team which visits the houses where people have been home quarantined.”On asking that residents had informed police about middle-aged couple, Bagga did not give a satisfactory reply. He said, “Don’t worry, the entire administration, including police, is working. We will contact them, as we have contacts of everyone. We will approach the district administration to find out where the couple had gone. We have also started stamps for home quarantine, so they could easily be identified by public and police.”In other incident, the residents of a residential complex had a stressful day on Sunday as despite repeated calls, the medical team did not come to their locality for examination of an Australia-returned youngster.“On Saturday night, a youngster, whose family lived in our apartment, returned from Australia. We all were concerned. Being vigilant citizens, we wanted to contact the administration to get his medical examination done,” a resident said.“When I dialed ‘104’ helpline, the attendant asked us to dial a local helpline number 1061-2444193. There the attendant asked to share my mobile number which I refused as I did not want to get into any trouble. Then the attendant said they are yet to receive the name of the foreign-returned youngster in the list, issued by the authorities.”He said, “Thereafter I got other helpline number of DC office, but nobody answered calls. For the entire day, we kept calling on different numbers, but nobody came to check him.”Similarly, a resident of Rishi Nagar said he wanted to inform about his Dubai-returned neighbor, but he could not get through 112 and 104 helpline numbers on Sunday. Then someone gave him the contact number of CMO. The CMO sent ASHA workers on Monday morning, but they refused to go inside that house. Then, he called up police. Two PCR cops, who came to the spot, asked him to contact the health department.“Is this the way Ludhiana administration is working to fight against coronavirus?” he questioned.CMO Bagga said, “They must have called a wrong number.

VIJAYAWADA: A day after the state government declared a lockdown in the state till March 31 amid increasing positive cases of COVID-19, thousands of people have started cancelling or defer- ring events such as marriages, engagements and birthday parties. The fear over acquiring the virus and the government imposing several restrictions as part of the lockdown have compelled people to reschedule functions. The closure of function halls, malls, clothing showrooms and other non-essential commercial establishments have also left no scope for the public to plan for the events.

481,['24/03/2020'],"If a new mother becomes ill with COVID-19, should she stop breastfeeding her child?","The number of positive novel coronavirus cases have touched a massive 339,645 around the world and resulted in 14,717 deaths globally. While scientists and medical experts are racing against time to invent a vaccine, the grim figures simply point to the fact that prevention is indeed the cure, at least in these circumstances. This is especially important for the high-risk group including people over 70, those with a compromised immune system, chronic illness and pregnant women.Since a woman’s immune system gets compromised and is in constant flux during pregnancy, it makes them more susceptible to contracting infections. While these infections primarily pose a threat to the mother, they can also infect the fetus or the baby during pregnancy or after the delivery.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), while there is no clear evidence that pregnant women and new mothers are at higher risk of severe illness than the general population, we do know that due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections.The simple answer is yes, you can and yes, you should. If you are a new mother, it is important to understand that close contact and early, exclusive breastfeeding can help the baby thrive. Infact, as per the WHO a woman with COVID-19 (the disease caused by the novel coronavirus) should be supported to breastfeed safely, hold her newborn skin-to-skin and share a room with her baby.World Health Organisation says that the baby who has already been exposed to the coronavirus by the mother will benefit most from direct, continued breastfeeding. This is because breast milk provides protection against many illnesses and strengthen the baby’s immune function.It is also crucial to note that no infants born to mothers with COVID-19 have tested positive for the novel virus. In these cases, which are a small number, the virus was not found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk. This is why CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends that a mother with flu to continue breastfeeding or feeding expressed breast milk to her infant while taking precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant.Women with COVID-19 can breastfeed their newborn if they wish to. However, it is important to strictly follow the below-mentioned guidelines:1.New mother must practice respiratory hygiene2.Wash hands thoroughly before and after touching the baby3.Routinely clean and disinfect all surfaces around the babyYou should wash your hands before and after touching your baby and keep all surfaces clean.If a new mother has contracted the novel coronavirus and is not able to nurse the newborn because of the sickness, some of the methods she can try to breastfeed her baby is:(Squeezing milk out of your breast so you can store it and feed it to your baby later.)(Relactation is the process of resuming breastfeeding after a period of no breastfeeding or very little breastfeeding.)",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74776336,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1153638/74776336.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/parenting/first-year/if-a-new-mother-becomes-ill-with-covid-19-should-she-stop-breastfeeding-her-child/articleshow/74776305.cms
482,['24/03/2020'],Kolkata resident fights racism with strong message on his T-shirt,"It started in Puri





What about others?





The other victims





Francis Yee Lepcha, 41, an Indian national of Chinese origin whose family has been living in Kolkata for three generations now, had never faced any racial discrimination. He used to consider himself lucky that unlike a few of his friends, his Mongoloid features had never been the subject of bullying in school or college. But in the past two weeks, everything has changed.Since the novel coronavirus pandemic turned life on its head around the world, his Chinese origin has become his bane. So bad has been his ordeal that he decided to design and don a T-shirt that says, ‘Ami kono coronavirus noi, ami Kolkata te jonmogrohon korechi, ami kokhono Cheen jai ni ’ (I’m not some coronavirus. I was born in Kolkata and have never been to China). “I am not even 100% Chinese. During World War II, my grandfather emigrated to the then Calcutta from China. He went on to marry a Lepcha girl from Darjeeling. That’s why I don’t even have pure Chinese features. But obviously, I don’t expect people to understand the difference,” Francis, a musician by profession, told us.A trip to Puri is an annual tradition of sorts in Francis’s family. And on March 15, they did just that. Everything went fine till they reached the hotel. On seeing them, a Bengali family raised a hue and cry demanding that if Francis’s family was allowed to stay, they would check out of the hotel. “The hotel authorities have known us for years and somehow managed to convince the family that we are not Chinese tourists,” Francis said.But that was just the beginning. The same evening, when the family went out to the beach, local people and other tourists started harassing and calling them ‘Corona’. Even a hawker made fun of Francis at a roadside stall. “That was the first time I lost my cool and started speaking to them in Bengali. On hearing my flawless accent, they stopped,” Francis told us.But the experience had already ruined their vacation and they decided to return to Kolkata. But the situation only got worse on their way home. On the train, most Bengali families refused to sit with them. The one family they did sit with started making fun of them, assuming they were from China. “After listening to their jokes for a while, I addressed them in Bengali. You should have seen the looks on their faces! Things were normal for the rest of the journey,” he said with a smile.Francis, however, is not suffering alone. Many others with the slightest hint of Mongoloid features are being harassed or bullied on the streets of Kolkata. All of them have been given a common name — ‘Corona’. And like Francis, they are facing harassment everywhere — on the road, in the Metro, on buses.This ordeal was the inspiration behind Francis’s T-shirt message. “Unlike me, many of my Chinese friends have faced discrimination their entire lives. But my recent experiences made me realise that people should know that not everyone with Mongoloid features is Chinese or from any other Southeast Asian country. That’s why I decided to get this T-shirt made,” he said.Once he made up his mind, he got in touch with a custom T-shirt maker in south Kolkata. “I wanted the slogan to be in a lighter vein and yet effective. I felt that only if it makes people smile, will it drive the message home,” Francis added.And his plan worked. Soon, people started approaching him on the street and in the Metro and he has been making quite a few friends since then. He has also been taking the opportunity to make them aware about his origin and about all those Indians who are often called ‘Chinki’ or considered foreigners. “To be very honest, I’m more worried about the people from the Northeast who stay in Kolkata. The city has around 1,500-2,000 residents of Chinese origin and the number is decreasing. But people from the Northeast will keep coming and going,” he added.A case in point is that of Sabrina Pradhan, a Kalikapur-based Nepali-origin insurance professional who has been residing in the city since 2007. On the evening of March 20, the local grocer refused to sell her goods or even accept money from her alleging that she and her kind were the reason coronavirus was spreading in the city. He went on to demand that she should return to her country. “Since 2007, I have been called names on numerous occasions on city streets. I’m kind of used to hearing people call me Chinki. After the outbreak, I even started hearing people call me Corona, but I ignored them. But this incident was the last straw. I snapped and challenged his baseless allegation,” she told us.Francis told us about another incident involving a family from Nagaland. “The man is a friend of mine and he told me that when his wife took their son to the local park recently, other kids refused to play with him. ‘They alleged that we had brought coronavirus to India and refused to speak to our son,’ he told me,” Francis added.Francis knows he has long bridge to cross. “But if I can create awareness and change the perception of even one person, I’ll consider it a step towards success,” he signed off.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74782734,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-918913,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-resident-fights-racism-with-strong-message-on-his-t-shirt/articleshow/74782734.cms

An MO asks a woman from Colaba a set of questions related to her health. Another MO tells a man from Chhindwara to immediately rush to a nearby PHC after he complains of fever and cough.

Similarly, there countless calls during the day to over 1,000 flyers who landed at Nagpur Airport since March 6 from the Corona War Room set up in the wake of Covid-19 scare. Those under watch are from the 10 identified high-risk nations and have landed through two international flights from Sharjah and Doha .

The teams ensures that the flyers are observing home quarantine guidelines ever since they left for their destinations from Nagpur. “Most of them are happy that someone cares for them,” said Dr Suresh Mote, a duty officer at war room.

The team has been divided into groups of two — an MO and paramedic or teacher — who are assigned around 50 to 70 flyers. They have formed WhatsAppp groups where advisories are sent several times a day. Each group calls up from their own cellphone asking if they are in self-isolation and reminding the days left out of the 14-day period.

Dr Chandra Suresh Dongarwar, an MO, said some had exited the group but preferred direct messages and calls. “They too ask us to take care,” Dr Dongarwar said.

Dr Asim Inamdar, the other duty officer monitoring the team, said they had been continuously updating the list of passengers flying in to Nagpur since March 6, when the city’s first positive patient landed from the US. “There were many discrepancies like incorrect phone numbers, addresses etc. The team initially had to search for accurate passenger details from airport authorities,” he said.

Dr Mote said there were many discrepancies like incorrect phone numbers, addresses etc. The team initially had to search for accurate passenger details from airport authorities,” he said.

The phone number was the only and most important link between the administration and these flyers. Hence, after anomalies surfaced as the team members couldn’t connect with them, the officials tightened the system. Of the over 1,000 flyers, 300 remained unreachable for several days. “The number came down to 200 now as we sourced their working numbers,” Dr Mote said.

Dr Inamdar said no flyer from these countries was allowed to leave unless the phone number was verified on the spot. “A passenger had to wait for three hours till a relative, whose number was given, called back to confirm,” said Dr Inamdar, adding that they could no more go by what people mentioned in the forms.

He said persistent efforts had to be made to connect with the foreign returned people. “We were happy some called back after three days. Most of them have been honest about their health and are reporting us all details,” Dr Inamdar said.

ZP CEO Sanjay Yadav said his department took up the responsibility on its own. “As the team members are using there own cell numbers, we would be reimbursing them the amount spent on calls,” he said.

AMARAVATI: A month after constituting a high-power Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe alleged insider trading in setting up capital city in Amaravati , the state government has handed over the case to Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ).

The government on Monday issued a GO entrusting the cases of irregularities committed by persons officiating in the erstwhile government of Andhra Pradesh while designating the new capital area to CBI.

The decision was taken based on the recommendations of the cabinet sub-committee report. Last month, the YSRC government had formed a 10-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) to conduct an inquiry into alleged irregularities, particularly land deals in the Amaravati capital region, during the TDP regime.

The cabinet sub-committee in its report submitted last December confirmed that various procedural, legal and financial “irregularities and fraudulent transactions” concerned with various projects, including the issues related to land in the CRDA region. The cabinet sub-committee, after verifying voluminous records, conclusively said in its report that public servants at the head of affairs in the erstwhile government misused and abused their official position to pre-determine the location of the new capital and purchased land to unjustly and illegally benefit their associates, their companies and businesses, family members and/or political party members.

The boundaries of the capital and its infrastructure were designed and modified to suit their personal interests. The report said that officials, in violation of their oaths, revealed privileged information about the location of the capital city to their associates. The report of the cabinet sub-committee also found several irregularities and illegalities with respect to procedure followed by the previous TDP government in acquiring land, offences committed by dispossessing landless poor of assigned lands by an elaborate conspiracy, forgery, fabrication of documents, tampering of records.

The committee observed that such transactions were penal offences under the IPC, the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988, Prevention of Money laundering Act.

Although, the SIT was constituted to probe the alleged irregularities, the government found that the funds were channelized by certain people living in outside the state and even abroad.

They have alleged that government agencies unnecessarily made their names public and they were facing mental harassment due to it. As all of them own shops in the city, they alleged that customers have stopped coming to their shops after their names were made public for no reason.

On March 20, a copy of a wireless message of Yavatmal police got viral on social media in which superintendent of police M Rajkumar ordered the PSOs to search whereabouts of Swapnil Desharwal , Abhay Jaiswal , Akash Gawande , and Nilesh Wadhwani . According to this letter, they came back from foreign tour but failed to report to the health department and are now absconding.

As soon as this letter having names and phone numbers of three of four persons went viral, they started receiving phone calls from across the city. Thakur, while speaking to TOI, made it clear that all four of them have already undergone checking and they were not absconding.

“We came back on February 27 via Mumbai. We were checked at Mumbai as well as at Nagpur. At both airports, no symptoms were observed in any of us, so they allowed us to reach Yavatmal. Thailand was not in the list of suspected nations at that time and we resumed our daily chores,” said Desharwal, who owns a cloth shop in Yavatmal. Other three also are from the business community. Wadhwani owns a medical store in the city.

“Somehow, our history was traced by the health department and they presumed that we avoided the health check-up and home quarantine. Our phone numbers mentioned in our self-declaration forms were not working. So, they directly informed police to search for us,” Wadhwani said.

All four reached police station immediately and met the SP on March 21 and informed that they were ready to undergo any check-up. Health department officials were also called but they said there was no need to conduct any test of these youths as they were healthy and without any symptoms after nearly 28 days of their travel.

“For no reason, we faced mental harassment. Both health department and police have agreed that we were not at fault. But as our names are now in public, people have already started avoiding us. Once the shops will open, it’s going to be difficult for us to get customers,” said Thakur.
