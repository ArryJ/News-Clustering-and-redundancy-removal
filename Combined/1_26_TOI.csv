0,['26/01/2020'],The unstated rules of personal space,"There’s a scene in Downton Abbey — set in early 1900s Britain — that had left everyone in splits. The dowager countess, played by Dame Maggie Smith, much to the amusement of the audiences, asks: “What’s a weekend?” Our grandparents/parents have a similar response when we talk about personal space. An almost-alien concept even a decade ago in India, it’s difficult to explain what constitutes ‘personal space’. But understanding it is the need of the hour in our country.Terms like ‘alonetime’, ‘personal space’, ‘boundary’ are hit social media hashtags these days as more and more people are negotiating (and renegotiating) conventional boundaries set by old societal standards.Digital expert Chetan Deshpande believes we are living in times of great intrusion in our personal space. A call from an unknown number, email from spam advertisers, WhatsApp from unknown people – all leave us annoyed. On top of that, the daily breaches of personal space — people standing too close to us, a seemingly mundane comment like ‘how much will you shop?’ — can make us irritable, angry.For instance, a friend once told me she was going to the salon, when someone from her family told her: “Why go to the salon so often? Didn’t you go last week?” For my friend, the question was invasive. What we must understand is that most of the time the ones who invade our personal boundaries are closest to us, and possibly do so without realising it (see box). Similarly, a colleague was once perplexed when a friend’s friend — who had just moved in to her apartment building — landed at her doorstep without calling her.In India especially, personal space as a concept has suddenly come to the forefront because we have jumped quite a few emotional communication hoops in a very short time. We had hardly moved from joint families to a nuclear one when the Digital Revolution changed our lives drastically. And just when we were getting used to gadgets, social media changed the way the whole world communicated. From a conservative approach towards life, we were posting our ‘relationship status’ out in the open.Marriages today aren’t just ‘big’ and ‘fat’, they are “Insta-worthy’. Divorce isn’t jaw-dropping news, couples remain friends after separating. Add the rise of single women, and you have a completely new India, where the SELF has gained precedence. Life coach Pankaj Rai says, “In such a scenario, personal space isn’t a luxury. It’s as important as the air we breathe, the water and food, we consume. We need personal space for our sustenance; it’s an important ingredient to evolve as human beings. Every person lives in his/her own world, made up of his/her own TIME and own SPACE. And this TIME/SPACE is sacred to all of us.”Corporate coach Farzana Suri concurs. “We are all made of experiences, likes, dislikes, and ideas. Personal space is the buffer space that allows you to focus on yourself and the things that uplift your soul by being YOU. In your personal space, you do not have the burden of playing all the roles you normally play in life because you have to,” she says.Along with changes in personal relationships, workplace culture has changed drastically too because of this same need for personal space. Says author Vaibhav Datar, “People are now demanding a work culture that lets them be; they want more intimate work stations, where they can focus on the job as against the open office policy that had become a rage. Now, office spaces are being designed keeping the new requirement of employees in mind.”If we don’t protect our personal space at work, we are more likely to feel drained. Datar adds, “You may often feel hurt and angry for what seem like minor infractions to others.” In fact, the need for space is so important that even intense perfumes in closed places, talking loudly in public places, are putting people off pretty quickly.Says Anu Mehra, dentist, “We are relearning to communicate. Social media has altered all our perceptions of what’s considered rude and what’s decent. For eg., if someone adds you on his/her FB, Insta, is it okay to keep sending them messages, saying “hi”, or “where are you from” or “I really like your smile”? Some may consider it just another way of communicating, while others would be very uncomfortable, even angry, with such messages. I personally consider it an invasion of my privacy.”That’s another conundrum. How do we navigate our personal spaces in an extremely public world? Can we put up posts describing our everyday lives, and expect our personal space not to be invaded at the same time?Family counsellor Gitanjali Sharma says, “Personal space is no longer the immediate space that surrounds us and moves with us. The next time we look at our phones to send a text message, it’s within the prism of our private space. And the danger is that it can be ‘hacked’ (read unsettled) by a single text or online message by anyone – it may be a family member on a WhatsApp group, a friend’s snide comment on Facebook, or a stranger saying ‘hi’ on platforms like Messenger and Insta DM, not caring about whether you are okay with it or not.”Adds Mehra, “Because of this constant intrusion in our ‘smart’ lives, we now have to fight for personal space much harder – the reason why we are clinging to hashtags like ‘alonetime’ or ‘personal space’. We have to take radical steps to block intrusions in our lives.”Every relationship requires a balancing act between personal spaces and giving precious time to your loved ones. The way we are in 2020, one cannot happen without the other.Every relationship is a balancing act with personal space – between personalities, between desires and between spending time together and giving yourselves time apart- The most serious aggressions often come from those closest to us. Communicate- Observe boundaries in office. Observe professional distance and reserve more intimate gestures for after hours- Call it to the invader’s attention — personal or professional — and give time to correct the behaviour- The immobility or inability to manage personal borders generates a high emotional costRalph Adolph and Daniel P Kennedy, neurologists at the University of Caltech (US), discovered a structure in our brain responsible for telling us where the limits of our personal space lie. This structure (amygdala) is associated with fear and our survival instinctWe are all made of experiences, likes, dislikes, and ideas. Personal space is the buffer space that allows you to focus on yourself and the things that uplift your soul by being YOUPersonal space is the physical, psychological and emotional region of aperson, in which one feels comfortable and free. You feel offended when an unknown person is too close to you and invading your personal space",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73583247,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-535080/73583247.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/the-unstated-rules-of-personal-space/articleshow/73583247.cms

2,['26/01/2020'],"Major Anirudh Nair: When I march today on Rajpath, it would be a childhood dream coming true","This story is from January 26, 2020

Anirudh Nair’s grandfather was an army man and during his childhood, watching the Republic Day parade on TV, with family, was a tradition. But, little did the youngster, who is now 26, know that he too would march on Rajpath one day – that too leading a contingent.

Major Anirudh, who hails from Palakkad, will lead the Grenadiers ’ contingent at the Republic Day parade today in Delhi and for him, it will also be a memorable achievement, earned after months of preparation and hard work. “Despite the chilly climate in Delhi, we have been going at 2 am to Rajpath, so that we put our best foot forward for a great parade on January 26 ,” says the man, who was chosen the contingent leader post a process that went on from June to November 2019. “It was a proud, joyous moment. I called my parents first, and then called my school in Vadodara, saying that I would be representing them on Rajpath! For someone who used to watch the march on TV with parents during childhood, it is a dream coming true,” he says.

His contingent is often the cynosure of all eyes at any parade they are in, thanks to their regal looks complete with the handlebar moustache and colourful safa (turban). They are taking part in the parade this year after four years. Anirudh says, “Every regiment takes part in the parade once in four or five years. The last time we took part, we walked home winning the Best Marching Contingent Award, and the team could be part of Victoria’s parade in Russia as well. We hope to do well this time too.”

Most of his crew members are deployed in border areas. “We don’t regularly do drills either. Bringing the 144 people for the parade together, ensuring that each of them stay fit in the tough weather of Delhi, and getting them all to march to the rhythm were all challenges,” says Anirudh, who has been in the army for the past four and half years, after finishing studies from National Defence Academy and Indian Military Academy.

A man who has spent most of his years outside of Kerala, how well does he connect with the State? “I’m quite a Malayali at heart,” says Anirudh, whose mom was apparently quite strict about him speaking his mother tongue at home. “She also tried to get me to read and write Malayalam well, albeit unsuccessfully. But, we used to come to Kerala at least 10 times a year during my childhood. My dad was in the railways and getting passes weren’t an issue for us. All our relatives are also in Kerala. Even now, I come as much as I can. A few months ago, my engagement was also in Kerala,” says Anirudh who recently got married to Ankita Jamwal, who works in Indian Space Research Organisation.

5,['26/01/2020'],All woven together,"When Kochi-based designer Sreejith Jeevan put up an Instagram post about the need for variations in Kerala handloom, many commented that it should remain as is, untouched. And perhaps, unevolved. But Jeevan believes that even though we need to preserve tradition, for the weavers to earn and for the craft to sustain, variations are needed to keep it relevant – to the craftsperson and to the consumer. This thought has taken roots in the Indian fashion and textile design circles, where many designers and entrepreneurs are working to keep the traditions not only ticking, but staying ahead of time.Take for instance, how Palak Shah of Ekaya Banaras and Sanjay Gupta of Raw Mango have added a different colour story to Banarasi to create a fresh new aesthetic. Designer Payal Khandwala crafts her own version of Indian modern, using Banarasi weaves. Anushé Pirani works with Indian handloom, khadi in ikat, bagru, Kashmiri thread embroidery to create contemporary ready-to-wear styles. Richana Khumanthem of Manipur runs an eponymous label that uses Northeastern fabrics in fresh cuts. Rina Singh of Eka believes in tweaking the crafts. She says, “As designers, we cannot re-invent crafts, they have been there for years. But what needs to be understood is that if they continue to do what they have been doing there is nothing new that would be created.”The tweaks are subtle but significant. For instance, Kolkata-based Ron Dutta of Fatherland worked with jamdani for his sarees. He explains, “We worked with the weavers, but the motifs or alignments used might not classify as jamdanis.”The grand doyenne of Indian textile tradition, Ritu Kumar, is heartened to see the current interest and experimentation with handloom in India. She notes that it’s only in India that even now that there’s a living tradition of weaves and textile – “which in other countries have been relegated to museums”. Jeevan agrees, and adds, “One of the biggest reasons crafts stay relevant is that tradition and modernity have found common ground.”As someone who has been working and researching textiles for years, Kumar suggests not intervening with the process of handloom (unless you are a textile designer) but the form and the way it is used. “One of the biggest push to handloom is the popularity of bohemian style with its asymmetric cuts that plays to the strength of our weaves,” she says. Jeevan notes that design is the way to upgrade crafts. “No one will buy crafts to ‘protect’ or ‘preserve’ or ‘save’. Crafts will survive when it is relevant.”Shah says that everything needs to be evolved based on what the market demands. “The key idea of working on traditional crafts is to stay close to the roots. It has to be evolution – and not a sudden change.” For instance, you can update colours, density of the fabric you are working with, and add new motifs. In the process, you also teach the weavers newer skills. “It has to be a measured evolution. You can’t go from grade A to Z, just move to A++,” she says.For young designers working with their native textiles, it’s also a fight for preserving their identity. Designer and illustrator Easternlight Zimik (from Manipur) started working with traditional textiles when he realised how important identity is after his experience outside his state. His illustrated series #textiletalk has started a conversation on Northeastern weaves. “When designers use indigenous craft or textiles, there’s a need to understand the value or sentiment of the story. For many tribes of Northeast, each textile represents something they value vitally, and defines their uniqueness,” he notes.Pirani feels that fashion schools should focus on these crafts as a part of the course along with modern aspects of fashion. Jeevan notes that handlooms too follow trends – not the fast fashion kinds but enough to bring freshness. He says, “Style can co-exist with tradition; it’s not a crime to make that tweak as long as craftsmen and customer find a connection.” And that connection is happening.Join the tribe: Manipuri designer Easternlight Zimik interprets tribal motifs from his area in a modern avatar for his #tribaltalk illustrated seriesDRESS UP: Richana Khumanthem of Manipur uses her local weaves and dyes to create everyday basics(From L to R)-Shawl we dance: Kullu-based weaver co-op Bhuttico designs special patterns in collaboration with Pero’s Aneeth Arora- Bag it: Subr Studio used Toda embroidery for a quirky bagOLD is the new ‘new’: (left to right) Palak Shah of Ekaya Banaras collaborates with Masaba Gupta to create younger silk sarees; and Rangsutra uses traditional Kashmiri embroidery in boho styles",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73609949,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-937762/73609949.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/designers/all-woven-together/articleshow/73609949.cms

That’s why I got connected to the role and became his fan. My favorite dialogue is Yengalukkum kaalam varum, kaalam vandha vaazhvu varum, vaazhvu vandha anivaraiyum saagadipomey. I started growing long hair like Victor and my friends started calling me with that name thereafter. Another reason why I admire anna is because of his hard work, dedication and ‘never give up’ attitude.Video editing has been my hobby for a long time. I once made a video of my favourite character Victor and uploaded it on my YouTube channel and posted it on my Twitter handle. Arun anna was tagged on it. Later, that night, he replied to it, saying, “Good edit bro ...Thank you, Victor was an unforgettable journey.” After a year, I edited one more video which he shared on his social media accounts.One day, I got a message and call from the head of his fan club, thanks to the videos I edited. He appreciated me for the video, which made me happy. After a few days, I got a chance to meet anna at his home through him. I was happy to see him as a grounded person. He enquired about my well-being. He made me and a few other fans to sit there and offered cool drink. For some time, I couldn’t believe it was true.

7,['26/01/2020'],Rat’s the way,"The year 2020 is the Year of the “Geng Zi” or Yang Metal Rat. In simpler terms – it’s the Chinese Year of the Rat. Rats, according to the Chinese, signify influence, intuition and insight. And the rat energy is being celebrated by luxury fashion houses such as Dior, Burberry, Gucci and more by launching special collections. To curate the celebratory symbolism of good fortune and prosperity, Dior launched a capsule collection featuring gold hues and red.Gucci’s Rat year collection features the world’s most famous mouse – Mickey Mouse. Classic pieces such as monogrammed coats and fitted plaid wool shirts with extended collars are restyled sporting Mickey Mouse iconography. Moschino too has launched a special Chinese New Year collection featuring a darker version of Mickey Mouse. Going as Mickey Rat, the designs are stitched onto varsity jackets, backpacks, and cotton T-shirt dresses as patches.But more than just clothes, as the first year of the 12-year cycle, the Year of the Rat, is expected to set the pace, template and direction of the next 12 years. Feng shui expert SBS Surendran says, “The energy of the year has a combination of elements which imply hidden good luck but could be quarrelsome. The year is good to prepare for. Go for long term planning and be cautious.” The Rat is a symbol of prosperity and financial well-being. Therefore, 2020 will be especially successful for starting a new business. At the same time, it is worth remembering that the Rat does not like unjustified risk. Therefore, you need to act slowly and think about each step.-Rats are clever, quick thinkers; successful, but content with living a quiet and peaceful life-Lucky colours: blue, gold, green-It is believed that a crystal vase or glass broken on Rat’s New Year’s Eve brings good fortune",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73583600,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-482921/73583600.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/style-guide/rats-the-way/articleshow/73583410.cms

Starring new comer Zaid Khan and actor Sonal Monteiro , seen in film Abhisarike, the first spell of the shoot had to be discontinued due to chilly conditions earlier this month. “The weather made us stop and now we are back for at least a week’s schedule in the city,” says the director.Quite in awe of the place, Jayathirtha says, “ I first came here ten years back for my first film Olave Mandara . Since then the city remained with me and I always wanted to come back to shoot an entire film in Banaras. It is a unique place where various cultures co-exist. You see cremation on a ghat and Ganga aarti on the adjoining ghat going on simultaneously. This is the beauty of the city that epitomises divinity and mystery. There are so many layers to the city which is rather unimaginable. We have already shot for more than a month in the city but I feel we have captured only ten per cent of Varanasi. There’s so much more to the city. Even the music of Varanasi is amazing. Apart from the song rendered by Sucharita Gupta, a known singer from the city, we have also recorded song of a boatman who has a mellifluous voice. I am not using Banaras for my film, a love story, but it is the other way round. I am using my film to show Banaras,” he says.Director Jayatirtha (BCCL/ Arvind Kumar)Even Sonal Monteiro is glad to be back for the shoot. “I was here for the earlier schedule of the shooting. Since it was my first time in the city, so people warned me that it will be really cold. I came all ready with my stoles and shawls but nothing worked as it was really cold. Despite the weather, I had an amazing experience. I saw the Ganga aarti and visited the various ghats. I went back with such great memories that I couldn’t stop talking about the city even while shooting for other films in Bengaluru. Even the Banarasi food, especially the sweets, is awesome,” she says.Sonal , who plays a Banarasi character in the film , says, “We did a lot of research on how the Banarasi girls dress up by checking on the pictures of Banaras. I even worked on the body language, for instance I had to be very comfortable on the boat like you know it’s my place.

13,['26/01/2020'],Captain Tania Sher Gill: I am very ziddi. I would have tried to be in the fauj till my last attempt,"She became the first woman to lead an all-men contingent at the Army Day parade earlier this month. Standing tall and leading the contingent as parade adjutant, Captain Tania Sher Gill will now be seen leading the Corps of Signals contingent at the Republic Day Parade today. Three days before the D-Day, on the day of final dress rehearsal, we caught up with Tania. While she has been hogging the limelight in the media over the past few weeks, she came across as a shy person who “does not like taking pictures while everyone is looking”. “I am an introvert,” she told us, right at the beginning of our interaction. For our interaction with her, we were joined by two NCC cadets – Shreeshma Hegde, all-India NCC Rajpath Parade Commander, and Mansi Kandiyal, Platoon Commander from Rajpath NCC contingent, to interview her. Mansi is from Uttarakhand Directorate and Shreeshma is from Karnataka and Goa Directorate. The cadets were excited and nervous to meet Tania who told them, “ Tum log toh badhe ho gaye ho!”, before explaining to us, “I have met them earlier during our practices at Cariappa Parade Ground.” What followed was a free-wheeling chat on Tania advising the young cadets not to give up on anything that they are passionate about, her ‘ ziddi’ temperament that lead her to join the forces and why one should not focus on their gender before joining the fauj.What goes on in my mind is that your contingent (NCC) is coming behind me, so if you can do it (leading your contingent), then I can also do it.Ever since I was a little girl, I have seen my father in uniform. So I always had it at the back of my mind that I also want to be a part of the forces.We also want to join the forces. But we have seen that whenever a girl from the younger generation thinks of joining the forces, their family is not always supportive because they feel that girls won’t be able to survive in the forces. What would you like to tell them? If you are passionate about it, you should just go for it because you only have one life, jo bhi hai, josh type karna hai, so just go for it.Training is the same for a male and a female officer because the same qualities have to be imbibed in both. At the end of the day, you want to become a good army officer, irrespective of your gender, and training is something in which you learn a lot. You grow as a person.Once you wear the uniform, you become a fauji. It is the same for everyone. Your religion, gender, region does not matter. Once you wear the uniform, you have to do justice to it.If you are passionate, then every day when you wake up, you’re grateful for this life.I had got placed in TCS in the final year of my college, but since I was more passionate about the fauj, I never joined it.No. I’m very ziddi. Agar fauj mein nahi hota toh I would have tried till my last attempt.There are so many women that I look up to, so even if there is one person who gets inspired by me, it means a lot to me.I believe whatever we faujis do, we do it irrespective of who is seeing us and who is noticing is. We do it for our Naam, Namak and Nishan.Captain Tania Sher Gill (centre) became the first woman to lead an all-men contingent at the Army Day parade earlier this month.

Making most of his visit, the Sahjahanpur-born actor visited his alma mater Bhartendu Natya Akademi (BNA) in Gomti Nagar. The Lucknow Central actor, who is a 2011 batch pass-out of BNA, believes that whatever he has achieved today is because of the institute. Sharing his feelings while visiting the institute, he said, “It was kind of a rebirth for me during those two years when I was studying here. I owe everything to this institute.” Talking about meeting with his mentors and the students, the Prem Ratan Dhan Paayo actor says, ""This visit to BNA was a memorable one. I met the students there and visited classrooms and hostel, I also spent a good time with my teachers Chitra ma’am and Lalit Singh Pokhariya sir. A lot of memories got refreshed as we chit-chatted about memorable incidents while I was studying here. They also shared their life experiences with me, it was kind of a master class for me. I also got opened the BM Shah auditorium where I staged my life’s first play. So, the visit was a nostalgic one for me, a kind of complete flashback for me.

Talking about the increase in the number of shoots here, he says, “It always feels good to shoot in Lucknow as I have studied and spent a lot of time here. The good thing is that Lucknow and its people have become familiar with the shoots and have been very cooperative. It is also a boon for actors who are not able to move to Mumbai for various reasons.”Sharing his feelings of working with John Abraham in the film Batla House, Alok says, “John Abraham was very supportive during the entire shoot and even appreciated my work a lot. By the time the shoot ended we were sharing a very good rapport. He is a very keen learner and it was a big surprise for me when an actor of his stature asked me about how I prepare for a role, the process of getting into a character and more.

NEW DELHI: After spending 25 years performing last rites of more than 25,000 unclaimed bodies, 82-year-old Mohammad Shareef from Faizabad, UP, has been conferred with India’s fourth highest civilian award, Padma Shri A bicycle mechanic by profession Shareef, who is popular as Shareef Chacha, started doing this community service after his 25-year-old son disappeared and later was found dead in 1992. “He was my elder son Mohd Raes Khan and he had gone to Sultanpur to work as a chemist but went missing for a month. Later, Raes was found murdered, his decomposed body in a sack. It was then that I decided to not let any unclaimed body lying off the road to be devoured by stray animals,” Shareef said in an older interview to TOI. He strongly believes that every human being deserves the dignity of a funeral and performs rites of unclaimed bodies from different faiths.Every day, he makes rounds of the mortuary, nearby hospitals, railway stations and police station for any unclaimed bodies. The authorities contact him only if no one comes to claim a body for 72 hours.The Good Samaritan conducts the last rites in a small room located in a cemetery in Rakabganj , Faizabad. “Lavaris Maiyyat/Matti ka ghuslkhana” (bath of destitute unclaimed bodies) reads a board hung outside this room. While burial costs about Rs 5,000, cremation can cost him up to Rs 3,500. He has friends at the graveyard as well as the cremation ghat who help him with the last rites. “Sometimes, they don’t even charge for their own labour, like for babies,” Shareef told TOI.In the past few years, Shareef has extended his service to the living as well.

21,['26/01/2020'],Giving NIA Elgar case shows police abused power: Sharad Pawar,"This story is from January 26, 2020

NCP chief Sharad Pawar (File Photo)

MUMBAI/NAGPUR: While Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh of NCP said on Saturday that the state government had sought legal opinion on the Centre’s move to transfer the Elgar Parishad probe to the National Investigation Agency , his party boss Sharad Pawar said the shift showed police had misused their powers and arrested innocent citizens.

CM Uddhav Thackeray, however, continued to be silent on the case being taken over by the NIA, which came close on the heels of Pawar writing to Uddhav asking him to set up a special investigation team to probe the matter.

Pawar’s contention is that the nine activists arrested by Pune police for their alleged links with the banned CPI (Maoist) were framed by the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis-led government. The cops have alleged that inflammatory speeches at the Elgar conclave on December 31, 2017 contributed to caste riots at the Koregaon Bhima war memorial the next day.

Stating that the proposed SIT would have “exposed the erstwhile BJP-led state government and law-enforcing agencies”, Pawar claimed that the NDA government entrusted the probe to NIA “out of fear that the SIT would expose the previous government’s illegal actions”.

Pawar admitted that it was well within the powers of the Centre to take over the probe in keeping with provisions of the NIA Act but said law and order was a state subject. “I have been told Pune police has submitted a statement of Justice P B Sawant, a former judge of the Supreme Court, in the case, but he has denied having made any such statement,” he said. Pune police have so far filed two chargesheets in a special court.

Section 5 of the NIA Act empowers the Union home ministry to take over investigation of a case without the state government’s nod or recommendations. Also, the NIA has legal authority to probe terror offences under the UAPA, which was applied in this case along with sections of the Indian Penal Code .

Deshmukh said in Nagpur, “Ideally they (Union home ministry) should have taken the state’s consent. Their move is unconstitutional. States like West Bengal and Chhattisgarh had also opposed NIA’s moves earlier. They (BJP) may want to protect their men who were part of the conspiracy.” He added that the probe against right-wing activists Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote for their alleged role in the Koregaon Bhima clashes was underway.

Food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal of NCP said it was time the state government did not allow central agencies to take over probes into cases registered within the state.

Attacking the earlier BJP government, Pawar said that when the issue was raised in the legislative assembly at the time, then CM Fadnavis had never claimed that the arrested activists had Maoist links, while the notification issued by the home ministry has stated that they had links with banned organisations.

Fadnavis, however, was on Saturday reported as saying by agencies that the state police had unearthed a huge network of “urban Naxals” and submitted all evidence to the court. “The Supreme Court had also supported the police action,” he said.

The MVA government was trying to mislead people about the probe for vote-bank politics, Fadnavis alleged. “These double standards must stop. Everybody should be united in the fight against anti-social elements,” Fadnavis stated.

Congress minister Nitin Raut said, “This (case transfer) is a wrong decision taken with a vengeful attitude. The Centre wants that nobody should protest against its actions and policies. Those who do will be victimised.”

MUMBAI: The 2019 novel coronavirus — the newest virus spreading from China to the rest of the world — appears to have begun its infectious journey from the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan and there are indications that it is similar to the SARS virus that caused a pandemic in 2002-2003.This means it can spread from person to person and from one city to another, shows the first review of the 2019 novel coronavirus — abbreviated as 2019-nCoV — infection among 41 patients from Wuhan.Both the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus and 2019-nCoV belong to the large family of coronaviruses that was mostly associated with benign common cold until SARS changed the perception by infecting over 8,000 and killing 774 in a few months. Another coronavirus, MERS (middle east respiratory syndrome), emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and was responsible for 850 deaths worldwide.The review, published in ‘ The Lancet ’ on Friday, showed that all 41 patients with the 2019-nCoV infection had “pneumonia with abnormal findings”. A third of these earliest patients infected in December 2019 needed to be admitted in intensive care and six of them died.Infectious diseases specialist Dr Om Srivastava said, “It is too early to say whether the novel coronavirus 2019 will become endemic in India.” There are no reported cases in India at this time, but he said there is a need for caution.“One should be aware and alert, but not alarmed. Use hand sanitization/sterilization as it is the best way to break the cycle of transmission,” he added. The WHO released pamphlets to show that the best way to reduce the risk of a coronavirus infection is to clean hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.While both SARS and ME- RS viruses emerged from bats, doctors are still working on the origin of the 2019-nCoV, the consensus is that it emerged from animals: Around 66% of the initial 41 patients were exposed to the seafood market. The first fatal case, person who had continuous exposure to the market, was admitted to hospital because of a seven-day history of fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing.“Five days after the onset of the illness, his wife, a 53-year-old woman who had no known history of exposure to the market, also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalised in the isolation ward,” said the Lancet report.The 2019-nCoV outbreak has resulted in 41 deaths and 1,287 infections in China as of January 25, but nearly 35 million residents are under a travel lockdown.Dr Srivastava said given the rapid progression in the past 10 days, it would be safe to say that India needs to immediately adopt measures but be ready to revise them if they don’t work.“The review of patients shows that there is no such thing as ‘people at a high risk’ as even healthy people in their 30s and 40s have been affected. We need to treat everyone with the same amount of caution,” he added. A senior doctor said the government may need to rethink its quarantine facility idea as sending people with any suspected viral infection to hospitals could jam the healthcare system.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73622335,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-303671,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/doctors-warn-coronavirus-could-be-as-potent-as-sars/articleshow/73621730.cms

The WHO released pamphlets to show that the best way to reduce the risk of a coronavirus infection is to clean hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.While both SARS and ME- RS viruses emerged from bats, doctors are still working on the origin of the 2019-nCoV, the consensus is that it emerged from animals: Around 66% of the initial 41 patients were exposed to the seafood market. The first fatal case, person who had continuous exposure to the market, was admitted to hospital because of a seven-day history of fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing.“Five days after the onset of the illness, his wife, a 53-year-old woman who had no known history of exposure to the market, also presented with pneumonia and was hospitalised in the isolation ward,” said the Lancet report.The 2019-nCoV outbreak has resulted in 41 deaths and 1,287 infections in China as of January 25, but nearly 35 million residents are under a travel lockdown.Dr Srivastava said given the rapid progression in the past 10 days, it would be safe to say that India needs to immediately adopt measures but be ready to revise them if they don’t work.“The review of patients shows that there is no such thing as ‘people at a high risk’ as even healthy people in their 30s and 40s have been affected. We need to treat everyone with the same amount of caution,” he added. A senior doctor said the government may need to rethink its quarantine facility idea as sending people with any suspected viral infection to hospitals could jam the healthcare system.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73622335,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-303671,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/doctors-warn-coronavirus-could-be-as-potent-as-sars/articleshow/73622349.cms

Alice Wells, senior US diplomat for South Asia region

A senior US diplomat has termed developments regarding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act a “vigorous democratic scrutiny”, while emphasising the importance of the principle of equal protection under law.

“(My) visit also offered an opportunity to hear more regarding developments with India’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which is undergoing I would say a vigorous democratic scrutiny, whether it’s in the streets, by the political opposition, media, and the courts,” said Alice Wells , senior US diplomat for South Asia region, who was recently in India.

“We continue to underscore the importance of the principle of equal protection under the law,” Wells added.

She reiterated US’s demand for expeditious release of politicians in J&K who are in detention without having been charged with an offence as well as regular access to the region for its diplomats.

Briefing journalists in Washington DC, Alice Wells said the US would continue to press for swift release of political detenues in J&K. Wells described the Indian government recently taking US ambassador Ken Juster and other foreign envoys to J&K as a “useful step”, but said American diplomats should be given regular access to the region.

Wells also emphasised what she termed near-total strategic convergence on Indo-Pacific policies between India and the US, observing that New Delhi’s foreign policy approach has shifted to a more vigorous espousal of Indian interests.

“India’s broadening strategic horizons over the past two decades have resulted in a shift away from a passive foreign policy into one that more vigorously advances Indian interests. Nowhere is that more true than in the Indo-Pacific region . Whether it’s in our growing maritime and naval cooperation, the Quad, India’s Act East Policy , there’s virtually no daylight in our approaches to the Indo-Pacific,” she said.

Wells said USTR officials were travelling to Delhi to complete a trade deal with India, saying “we remain focused on achieving a trade deal that promotes fair and reciprocal trade”.

She expressed satisfaction with the steps taken by Pakistan to avert the prospect of being put on the “black list” of the Financial Action Task Force for its reluctance to act against terror groups, but reminded the Imran Khan government of the consequences of not taking more steps .“We’ve been pleased to see progress by Pakistan towards fulfilling FATF obligations,” said Wells, adding that Islamabad’s failure to meet the obligations would have devastating impact on its economic reform programme.

“But the more evidence of Pakistan’s seriousness in both documenting its economy and in shrinking the space for militants to be able to take advantage of Pakistan’s banking system or territory, the more confidence that the international community and business community will have in working with Pakistan,” she said. “It’s a question of fulfilling the requirements that have been spelt out and that are asked of all countries in the international system. So it’s not a political process, but we certainly support and stand ready to assist Pakistan as it implements these obligations,” she added.

The fundamental rights in the Constitution span the right to equality, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion , cultural and educational rights, and the right to constitutional remedies…Articles 14-18 | Deal with equality before the law, which applies to all persons regardless of race, nationality or colour, within the territory of India. The state cannot discriminate on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. However, the focus is on substantive equality, so the state can make special provisions for women, or any socially or educationally backward classes of citizens, scheduled castes or tribes.Articles 19-22 | Lay out the freedoms guaranteed to every citizen, and the specific conditions where the state can restrict individual liberty. These freedoms include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly, freedom to form associations, freedom of movement, to reside and settle, and freedom of profession, occupation, trade and business.Article 21 | The right to life and liberty, has been interpreted to strengthen human dignity and due legal process, including livelihood, health , education, environment and humanitarian treatment in prison. The right to property was removed as a fundamental right in 1978, and the right to privacy has been recently added. There are safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention.Articles 23-24 | Deal with the right against exploitation.Articles 25-28 | Articulate freedom of religion in a secular state that respects all religions equally. It guarantees freedom of conscience and the right to profess, propagate religion. Article 26 deals with the management of religious affairs, subject to conditions of public order, morality and health. Article 28 disallows religious instruction in wholly state-run educational institutions.Articles 29-30 | Protect the interests of minorities.

It allows religious and linguistic minorities to conserve their language, culture and educational institutions, subject to reasonable regulation by the state.Articles 32-35 | Deal with the remedies for any violation of these constitutional rights. This means the right to move the Supreme Court and its power to issue writs to enforce fundamental rights, and that only Parliament has the right to make laws that give effect to these fundamental rights. Also, the basic structure doctrine laid out by the Supreme Court means that this set of core, inviolable ideals of the Constitution cannot be damaged or altered by Parliament, and that the Supreme Court remains the arbiter of all amendments.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73618859,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1215684,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/get-to-know-your-fundamental-rights/articleshow/73618848.cms

President Ram Nath Kovind in his address to the nation. (ANI photo)

NEW DELHI: President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday called upon the people, especially youth, to adhere to non-violence while fighting for any cause and “hold fast to constitutional methods”, a remark seen as coming in the backdrop of incidents of violence during protests in several parts of the country against the new citizenship law.

In his address to the nation on the eve of 71st Republic Day , the President said referred to Mahatma Gandhi’s credo of ‘ Ahimsa ’ (non-violence) and said his talisman for deciding whether an act is right or wrong “applies to the functioning of our democracy”.

Pointing out the importance of both government and opposition. he said, “While giving expression to their political ideas, both must move forward in tandem to ensure that development of the country and welfare of its people are promoted consistently.”

“It should be part of our daily routine to introspect on Gandhiji’s message of truth and non-violence, which has become all the more necessary in our times,” the President without making any reference to the recent violent protests against CAA and NRC.

Kovind said though the Constitution gave rights to all citizens, it also placed responsibilities on them to always adhere to the central tenets of the democracy - justice, liberty, equality and fraternity.

The President said the present decade of the 21st century will be “the decade of the rise of New India and a new generation of Indians”.

Stressing on strong internal security for development, he said the government had taken several concrete steps to strengthen it.

“I have nothing but unreserved praise for our armed forces, paramilitary and internal security forces. Their sacrifices to preserve the integrity and unity of our country present a saga of unparalleled courage and discipline,” he said.

JAIPUR: The Rajasthan assembly passed a resolution on Saturday urging the Centre to repeal the contentious CAA, amid opposition by BJP which accused the Congress government of pursuing appeasement politics. Rajasthan is the third state to pass such a resolution after Punjab and Kerala .

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said, “We have urged the Centre to repeal the law as it discriminates against people on religious grounds, which violates the secular principles of our Constitution. This is the first time in the history of the nation that a law has been enacted which discriminates on religious grounds.”

The resolution, which was passed by a voice vote, also asked the Centre to withdraw the new questionnaire framed for preparation of the National Population Register (NPR) because providing the additional information “would cause huge inconvenience” to the people.

The resolution has incorporated several objections against the National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and NPR. It has also urged the Centre to start the nationwide Census only after dropping the new fields of information.

DGP Gupteshwar Pandey

PATNA: DGP Gupteshwar Pandey , who blamed some “lax” and “lazy” police personnel for spurt in the incidents of cash loot in the state, claimed that the law and order situation would improve within a week.

“Wait for a week and you will see the difference (in the state’s law and order situation). I have come here with some purpose,” Pandey told the media on the sidelines of a review meeting at Hajipur, the district headquarters of Vaishali, on Friday evening.

The three-hour-long review meeting with top police officers from the police headquarters focused on cases pending with different police stations, arrests made in the cases and action initiated against criminal gangs active in their respective areas of operation.

When confronted by media persons, Pandey said, “Efforts are on to identify lax and lazy police personnel, whose callousness has earned a bad name for the department.”

Pandey, however, claimed that the law and order situation was better in Bihar compared to many other states. To buttress his point, the DGP said while other states are dealing with violent protests over CAA, NRC and NPR, Bihar is busy in implementing its ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali’ programme.

“It is because of a handful of police personnel that people’s perception about law and order has changed. Tough action will be taken against those cops to set things right,” the DGP said, hinting at tougher “action” against people involved in unlawful activities.

The review meeting, which was attended by ADG (CID) Vinay Kumar, ADG (law and order) Amit Kumar, ADG (operations) S M Khopde, DIG, (operations) Vinay Kumar and IG (Tirhut range) Ganesh Kumar among others, assumed significance in the wake of involvement of Pappu Choudhary-Chandan Sonar gang in the kidnapping of Praveen Somani from Raipur in Chhattisgarh recently.

Pappu, the kingpin of an interstate gang, is stated to be a resident of Vaishali district. Earlier, the gang was blamed for the kidnapping of an affluent trader Sohail Hingora from Gujarat. Hingora was let off near the Gandhi Setu after the family members coughed up a huge sum as ransom.

What is the incubation period (duration in which symptoms are visible) of this virus?

How does the virus spread?

Can this be treated?

How can this virus be avoided?

Excerpts:Not much can be said about this virus as of now. Since its strain has not yet been identified, it is called novel coronavirus. It is being said that the virus originated from seafood market in Wuhan city of China. However, the source of its transmission has still not been confirmed. The first infected person has to be identified to reach the source. If that person is dead, the process of identifying the source will be much more difficult.All districts have been put on alert. Health workers are also being sensitized. Hospitals have been asked to keep an eye on people having symptoms similar to those infected by coronavirus. Teams have been formed in all government medical college and hospitals to collect the blood samples of suspected patients and send the same to virology laboratory in Pune for tests.Symptoms are similar to typical viral symptoms, such as high fever, cough and respiratory distress. In a case study of a person who died in China due to this virus, kidney failure was also reported, which means the virus causes organ failure at last stage.This is still not clear. General viruses incubate in two to seven days.It spreads through coughing and sneezing. Touching the infected person is also dangerous. Even furniture can have the droplets containing the virus.As of now, there is no anti-viral available for coronavirus. Only symptomatic treatment can be given. Precaution is the best measure to avoid the virus. World Health Organisation has taken note of the virus and started working on it.Though coronavirus has not yet reached India, one should take precautions to stay safe. People should always wash their hands and wear mask.

PATNA: Four people, including three women, were killed in three separate incidents in the state during the last 24 hours.

A 40-year-old woman was shot dead and her body dumped at a deserted place under Pachrukhi Sahayak police station in Siwan district on Saturday. SHO Gopal Pandey said her identity was yet to be ascertained.

In another incident, the police recovered a half-burned body of a 20-year-old woman from Baksauti Hills under Govindpur police station in Nawada district on Saturday. SHO Nagendra Prasad said preliminary investigation suggested that she had been killed somewhere else and her body was dumped there. The incident came to light when some residents, who had gone to attend the nature’s call, spotted the almost nude body. They informed the police. “Efforts are on to ascertain her identity,” he said.

In Saran district, the police recovered the bodies of a woman and a man from two different places under Baniapur police station and Gaura police outpost, respectively. The incident came to light when a street dog was seen carrying the hand of a woman in its mouth. Her body was burned beyond recognition.

Saran Sadar DSP Ajay Kumar Singh said her head was severed and breast chopped off with a sharp-edged weapon. A sniffer dog was pressed into service to trace the killers. An empty container used for carrying kerosene was found on the spot.

The DSP said the killers set the woman’s body on fire after pouring kerosene. About 4km away, the body of a man was recovered under Baniapur police station. That body was also not identified. “Both the bodies have been sent to Chhapra sadar hospital for autopsy,” he added.

The DSP said the police stations across the district have been put on alert. “Once the identity of the deceased is ascertained, police will find out the reason for the double murder,” he said. The locals, however, didn’t rule out love affair as the reason behind the killings.

PATNA: The five-party Left combine on Saturday formed one-hour human chain at Patna and the district headquarters in the state demanding withdrawal of Citizenship (Amendment Act (CAA) and opposing proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR). They claimed that once implemented, these issues would deprive crores of people of citizenship rights, besides causing incalculable harassment and monetary loss to all in mustering proofs to get the citizenship rights.

The representatives of Congress, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) also joined the human chain organized formed from Buddha Smriti Park to Gandhi Maidan in Patna.

CPI(ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya, CPI state secretary Satya Narayan Singh, CPM secretariat member Sarvoday Sharma, CPM senior Subhashini Ali and senior functionaries of the Forward Bloc and Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) joined the human chain at Patna. Groups of people also took out processions in various localities of Patna.

Bhattacharya said the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre first wanted to create Hindu-Muslim divide in the country through CAA, NRC and NPR, but the Centre’s policy moves on citizenship have evoked widespread protests from people across the country.

“The most sinister part of the new citizenship determination exercise is that the official concerned would have the discretion to mark the application with “Doubtful or D” having perused the documentary proofs submitted. In that case, the person would eventually be put in detention camps, which have been constructed in Assam and were in the process of being newly built in all the states. Or the existing jails would be treated as detention camps,” Dipankar said.

The human chain was also supported by the Imarat-e-Shariah, a religious body of Muslims of Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha. Various other religious groups, including All India Milli Council (AIMC), Jammat-e-Islami and All India Muslim Majlis-e-Mushawarat also participated in the human chain formation.

Maulana Shibli Qasmi, the general secretary of Imarat-e-Shariah, said, “In the past, several governments had taken wrong decisions but after public opinion, they also made amends. The government need to realize their mistake and should revoke the law. Such laws do not make the country, rather it breaks the democratic fabric.”

AIMC vice-president Maulana Anisur Rahman Qasmi said, “By making citizenship law, the Centre is targeting the underprivileged, Dalits and Muslims. How the poor people will produce the required papers, and if they failed to produce the papers their citizenship will be in question.”

34,['26/01/2020'],Memories and legacy of ‘largest forced migration’,"This story is from January 26, 2020

There were tales of trauma, reunion and hope as three “chroniclers” of Partition – BBC journalist Kavita Puri, authors Aanchal Malhotra and Sam Dalrymple – came together to narrate stories of those impacted by the “largest forced migration in the world.”

Talking about the “memories” that have stayed with people even 70 years after they were displaced, the three panellists agreed that most people remember their hometowns fondly, despite witnessing violence and bloodshed.

“When we speak to the survivors of Partition and ask them where they are from, they always mention their villages. We don’t hear India or Pakistan,” said Malhotra. Puri concurred, and added, “People remember extraordinary acts of kindness, the helping hand of a neighbour, people who helped them escape.”

The three agreed that people who left behind their homes, sometimes overnight, still have a “visceral” sense of belonging to their native places. “Memories can be tricky to deal with, but people who were forced to leave still want to return, if only once. Sometimes that’s not possible,” said Malhotra.

Dalrymple, the co-founder of Project Dastaan, spoke of the importance of reconnecting people with their hometowns. Dastaan, a peace-building initiative backed by Oxford University, helped reconnect individuals displaced in the 1947 Partition of India and Pakistan to their ancestral villages through virtual reality technology. The project will soon expand into Bangladesh.

“We have seen people meet after 70 years of no contact, but they have managed to reconnect just like old times,” he said.

The session also ended with words of caution. “The Partition was a result of a feeling of otherness that was constantly propagated. But we have to remember that otherness does not begin with violence. It begins on small incremental ways. So, we need to pay heed to that,” said Puri.

37,['26/01/2020'],Even retired employees can form a union: Madras high court,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Representative image

CHENNAI: The Madras high court has made it clear that law does not state that only serving employees of an organisation can form unions under the Trade Union Act as even retired employees can form a separate union to espouse their grievances relating to terminal benefits and register it.

Justice S Vaidyanathan made the observation while allowing a plea moved by Karur Vysya Bank Retirees’ Association challenging the order of the labour department denying registration to their association on the ground that the members of the association are not in service.

“India is a democratic country, where there is no restriction for citizens to express their grievances to government by means of ahimsa and as such, preventing one sect of persons, namely, retired employees to form a trade union to espouse their cause to the government cannot be permitted at any cost, by giving a different interpretation to the provisions of law,” the judge said.

To put it precisely, even if seven employees were not on the rolls, they are entitled to form an association that has to be registered under the Trade Union Act and the same cannot be refused to be registered on this score, the judge said.

Though the existing union with permanent employees can espouse the cause of retired employees or others, who were not in employment, on the ground of community of interest, consequent to the absence of such interest in the present days, there is nothing wrong in permitting the retired employees to have their own association under the act, as unions, having permanent employees on the rolls, are withering away and shirking from their moral responsibilities to espouse the cause of employees who cease to be on the rolls, said Justice Vaidyanathan.

PATNA: More than 50 teacher aspirants, who could not download their admit cards for the State Teachers’ Eligibility Test (STET) to be held on January 28, staged protests outside the Bihar School Examination Board ( BSEB ) office here on Saturday.

The STET candidates from several districts said they were making rounds of the BSEB office for the last three to four days, but to no avail.

Rashmi Kumari from Gaya said every time, she tried to download the admit card, invalid login details popped up on the computer screen. “When I brought the matter to the notice of BSEB, it said my admit card was not made available as I had not paid the registration fee. The fact is that I had paid the registration fee and the slip for the same is in my possession,” she added.

Another aspirant from Nawada, Ravi Ranjan Kumar , said four candidates with identical name got the same roll number.

BSEB chairman Anand Kishor , however, said there was no duplication of roll numbers as claimed by the candidates. “Candidates who failed to download admit cards will get the same on humanitarian grounds. Around 56 candidates were not issued admit cards as they had not submitted the registration fee,” Kishor added.

Earlier, the committee had held series of meetings with the coordination committee of three lawyers’ associations of the high court.

Committee chairman-cum-senior advocate Yogesh Chandra Verma said lawyers had abstained from routine work in the second half of Friday to express reservation over the present case-listing pattern which, they felt, was very “complicated”.

Verma said the committee of judges comprised Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh and Justice Hemant Kumar Srivastava, who are senior most after Chief Justice of Patna high court Sanjay Karol. “After interaction in multiple sittings with committee members, they found problems of lawyers to be genuine,” Verma said.

“The coordination committee will again meet at 1.30pm on Monday,” Verma said, adding the listing pattern was changed by high court administration around three months back.

Verma said their request for ‘independent and self-contained cause list’ of cases for each day was accepted. “Cases will now be taken up in chronological order,” he said, adding bail matters will be taken up chronologically for hearing. Verma said tied-up matters would be taken up for hearing by single and division benches every Wednesday.

PATNA: Three days after deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi (SuMo) called him “ungrateful”, JD(U) national vice-president Prashant Kishor on Saturday took a dig at the senior BJP functionary by tweeting a five-year-old video clip in which he is heard accusing CM Nitish Kumar of deceiving BJP, RJD chief Lalu Prasad and many others.“Nobody can match Sushil Modi when it comes to giving character certificate(s). See, earlier he used to speak (for giving character certificate); now that he has been made the deputy CM, then he is giving it in writing,” Kishor tweeted a post roughly translated in English.“…Betrayal is in the DNA of Nitish. The way he betrayed Jitan Ram Manjhi, BJP after 17 years of alliance, Shivanand Tiwari, Jitan Ram Manjhi, George Fernandes and Lalu Prasad, it shows betrayal of Nitish, not of people of Bihar,” SuMo is heard saying in the video tweeted by Kishor.Incidentally, SuMo in the video had made the statement in response to a campaign originally planned by Kishor ahead of Bihar assembly elections in 2015 when Kishor’s poll management firm I-PAC was working for Nitish, who had aligned with Lalu’s RJD and Congress after breaking the 17-year-old ties with BJP after it declared Narendra Modi as its PM candidate for 2014 general elections.During his Muzaffarpur election rally on July 25, 2015, PM Modi had said: “Iss aadmi kaa DNA hi kharab hai. (This man’s DNA is poor)”. Kishor was prompt in taking up the DNA remark, portraying it as an attack on Bihari pride. Accordingly, JD(U) had launched a DNA campaign to corner BJP and PM Modi.Though Nitish won the election in alliance with RJD and Congress, he later came back to BJP and formed government with SuMo as his deputy again in 2017. Recently, when Kishor and JD(U) functionary Pavan Kumar Varma questioned Nitish’s support to Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and alliance with BJP for ensuing Delhi assembly elections, SuMO came to his defence and tweeted on Wednesday: “Nitish at times faces the irony in which the people whom he lifts from the ground, create problems for him later … He made many members of Rajya Sabha (referring to Pavan) and lifted many people from the non-political corridors and gave them higher position in the organization (referring to Kishor).

The world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing centre in Surat is fast emerging as a low-cost diamond jewel... Read More

SURAT: Thinking of buying diamond jewellery, and the skyrocketing prices are deterring you? Not any more. You can still flaunt sparkling diamonds on your jewellery at affordable prices.

The world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing centre in Surat is fast emerging as a low-cost diamond jewellery hub. It is here that diamond-studded gold jewellery including rings, nose pins, pendants, necklaces, bracelets etc., are available in the price range of Rs 3,000-Rs 15,000.

More than 60 manufacturers in the diamond hub of Varachha and Katargam have ventured into the low-cost affordable jewellery segment in the last few years, targeting middle-class and millennial consumers.

The manufacturers, who have their own in-house designing facilities, have been directly sourcing the polished diamonds from small and medium diamantaires. The lightweight jewellery is designed using 1.5 gram to 4 grams of gold, studded with the tiny gems.

Industry sources said that low-cost jewellery to the tune of Rs 1,500 crore is manufactured per annum in Surat and more than 95% of it is sold in India.

Raju Moradiya of Rosetta diamond jewellery told TOI: “All our products are priced below Rs 10,000 in real gold and real diamonds. Every month, we are launching 300 new jewellery designs and that we have tied up with more than 700 jewellery stores across India.”

According to Moradiya, the gold content in the jewellery is only 2 grams, which makes it affordable for the consumers. Even if the gold prices are fluctuating, the prices of the jewellery articles are fixed and never change. For example, the rings are priced at Rs 6,999 followed by nose pins at Rs 3,000, pendants at Rs 6,999 and necklaces at Rs 10,000.

Kinjal Suchak of Kiyaash diamond jewellery said, “Diamonds are forever and for everyone. This was the basic aim behind starting our jewellery line. All our diamond-studded jewellery products come at a fixed price of Rs 8,500, be it ring, necklace, bracelet, nose pins, pendants etc. These items are selling like hot cakes in the northern and western markets.”

Another manufacturer, Dipak Gadhesariya, director of Mezzaria Jewels Private Limited, said, “We are manufacturing jewellery at low cost as well as high-end jewellery. But our low-cost jewellery is more popular in India.”

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal. (Image credit: @AamAadmiParty)

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday read out the Preamble while addressing a gathering at Chhatrasal stadium. The CM stated that it was also the responsibility of the citizens to protect the Constitution. Towards the end of his speech, Kejriwal recited the song ‘Hum honge kamyaab’ and the children in the audience repeated it after him.

“It is our duty to protect the Indian Constitution,” Kejriwal said at the cultural programme organised by Delhi government on the occasion of the 70th Republic Day . Members of Delhi Police, Delhi Fire Service and Civil Defence, Home Guard and students of various schools participated in the parade with the chief minister taking the salute. Girl students from various government schools in Delhi got the loudest cheer.

Soon after the parade was over, Kejriwal addressed the gathering by saying “Bharat mata ki jai, inquilab zindabad and vande matram.”

He congratulated the citizens of Delhi and the nation on the occasion of Republic Day. “Our Constitution was framed by revered freedom fighters and people who made many sacrifices. They had the vision and the dream of a free India, which has been preserved in the Constitution.”

Before reading out the Preamble, Kejriwal said, “The Preamble is the soul of our Constitution. It acts as its crux.”

“If we protect the Constitution, it will protect us when our nation is in danger. We have to excel in all fields and make India great and number one nation in the world,” he added.

The CM also said that he wouldn’t not be able to speak much because of the poll code of conduct. “Each year, on the occasion of Republic Day, I used to interact with you on a lot of issues of public importance. I used to answer all your questions. But unfortunately, I will not be able to interact with you much today since the model code of conduct is in force,” the CM added.

After the cultural programme by students depicting various dances from different regions was over, the CM walked up to them clapping through the way. He later released tri-colour balloons in the air to end the celebrations.

BJP's Model Town candidate Kapil Mishra

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Saturday banned BJP’s Model Town candidate , Kapil Mishra, from campaigning for the next 48 hours for allegedly trying to aggravate differences between two communities through his comments.

During the ban, which began at 5pm on Saturday, Mishra is barred from holding public meetings, carrying out public processions, rallies or road shows and making public utterances in the media.

Complete coverage on Delhi elections

On Friday, Delhi Police registered an FIR against Mishra under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, following a directive of the Election Commission. Referring to the protests against Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens at Shaheen Bagh, Mishra on Thursday tweeted that the February 8 elections would be a “muqabla” between India and Pakistan. He followed it up with remarks that several “mini-Pakistans” had been created in Delhi and Shaheen Bagh was being replicated all across the capital.

Reacting to the ban, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said he respected the commission’s order but urged it to take into cognizance the communally sensitive slogans being raised at Shaheen Bagh.

In a show-cause notice to Mishra sent by the office of the returning officer of Model Town assembly constituency on Friday, the commission said the remarks had violated provisions of Model Code of Conduct and the Representation of the People Act, and was punishable under law. It stated that in case the reply was unsatisfactory, action would be initiated against Mishra without any further notice.

In a four-page reply, Mishra said his comments had been taken out of context and misrepresented intentionally to paint a one-sided picture. He also claimed he had neither named any caste, community, religion or linguistic group, nor did he intend to aggravate any differences to gain electoral benefit. “My statement merely refers to two countries, two entities who are not involved in any election process at the national level at present,” he said, adding that the protests were causing inconvenience to people.

Before the notice was issued, Mishra said protesters at Shaheen Bagh “have refused to follow the Constitution and Parliament. Videos are emerging of children talking about the death of PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. The site has virtually turned into a mini-Pakistan. It is being backed by political parties”.

He had claimed that for political gains, parties were creating Shaheen Bagh-like protest centres. “In such a scenario, Hindustan will stand up against Pakistan and the assembly elections will be a contest between Hindustan and Pakistan.”

Girish Chodankar

PANAJI: Congress on Saturday demanded that the zilla panchayat elections, scheduled on March 15, be postponed and the powers of reserving wards be vested with the State Election Commission (SEC) as assured by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar as per the provisions of the Constitution.

BJP government assured on the floor of the House in 2017 that the necessary amendments would be done to the Panchayati Raj Act, but deliberately sat over it for three long years, Congress state president Girish Chodankar said, adding, “Frequent reminders by the Union ministry of Panchayati Raj and subsequent affidavit filed by the SEC before the high court there was not much headway.”

Chodankar said the declaration of date for ZP polls was unconstitutional and amounts to contempt of court.

The poll panel had stated in its affidavit that all panchayat elections have to be conducted under its supervision, direction and control right from electoral roll preparation to declaration of results, as per Article 243K of the Constitution.

In 2017, Parrikar had informed the House that “delimitation and reservation is difficult for government to do in a short period as it leads to confusion, allegations and someone goes to court. That is why I have clearly written on file that there is no need for the government to do it and election commission can do it”.

In spite of this, BJP government has not amended both Panchayati Raj and Municipal acts till date with a clear intention to hijack the grass root level governance by self-governing bodies in violation of the provisions of the Constitution, he said.

It is also clear that this has been done in order to manipulate the forthcoming ZP elections , and giving scope for challenging it in court which will be held illegal unless the powers of delimitation and reservation of wards are transferred to the SEC.

The Congress state president has now demanded that the order of conducting ZP elections be revoked and necessary amendments be made in the forthcoming Assembly session beginning February 3 and announcing another date for ZP elections.

Indore: Parents of Nirbhaya claimed to have lost their faith on human rights organisations and said that international human rights bodies are more interested in protecting convicts than upholding rights of victims and their families.

“Did my girl (Nirbhaya) who died seven years ago not have any human rights or do I not have any human rights while I have been fighting for justice? Not even one organization had come to ask me how I am fighting till now. Government should help such families financially,” mother of Nirbhaya, Asha Devi told reporters on Saturday.

Asha Devi was in city along with her husband, Badrinath Singh and lawyer Seema Kushwaha for a flag hoisting ceremony on Republic Day.

Kushwaha added that people, who are talking about human rights of convicts, should study the definition of human rights as these convicts did extremely heinous crime.

“It has been seven years but crimes haven't decreased. Even though there were several amendments done, it has been useless. Government is insensitive towards the females which is 49% of the country’s population. We are hopeful that the Article 72 will be amended,” she added.

Asha Devi, who is hopeful that convicts will be executed on February 1, added that in a span of three decades she has seen only one rape convict being hanged and she has decided that she will continue to fight for rights of several other Nirbhayas.

“Each month 6500 rapes take place in our country how can it be expected that the country will progress if society is not safe how will country be safe? I want to see how much court gives right. I am expecting Supreme Court to come up with guidelines soon and it's not just one Nirbhaya but for several others,” said father of Nirbhaya.

Parents of Nirbhaya suggested that in case of rape, or gang rape the family shouldn’t hide the victim as it wasn't the fault of the girl but that of those criminals. Parents should support the girl and the society will support. They also urged not to differentiate between children on the basis of gender.

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat addresses workers on Saturday

Gorakhpur: On the second day of his five-day visit to Gorakhpur, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Saturday addressed Sangh members and discussed the importance of social harmony.

“Social evils like caste discrimination, inequality and untouchability need to end soon along with social arrogance. Negative propaganda is dividing society and this too should end.” Bhagwat said, water conservation, tree plantation and plastic-free surrounding is the need of the hour to remove environmental imbalance.

Backing traditional forms of agriculture, he said, “neither soil gets polluted nor crops get poisoned. Chemical fertilizers harm water, land and human health. With efforts of RSS, organic farming is being promoted. We follow two aspects of 8-fold yoga, yam-niyam. And we need to follow five rules for agriculture, which are swachhta, swadyay, tap, sudharm and santosh.”

“Under swachhta, villages should be kept clean, swadhyay is studying agriculture, ‘tap’ is considering land as God and ‘sudharm’ is following dharma, while santosh is organic farming.” RSS chief said.

Bhagwat said coexistence without caste discrimination could usher real development in the country. “For people of all communities to live in harmony, one needs to go to villages and showcase core Indian values to bring about a change in society. This can be achieved without advertisement or government help and change can be brought about at the grassroots.”

Gulab Chand Kataria

JAIPUR: State BJP president Satish Poonia on Saturday said the resolution passed against CAA , a law made by the Parliament, was an ‘unconstitutional’ move by the Gehlot government.

Poonia said the BJP will oppose the move at all possible public platforms. While talking to the mediapersons at the gate of Vidhan Sabha, Poonia said that Gehlot has blatantly demolished the Constitution and has lost right to remain on any constitutional post.

“Congress should read that Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi had told that if the Hindus and Sikhs will face any problem in Pakistan will be persecuted they will have full right to come to India,” said Poonia. He reiterated that in the federal cooperative system state cannot oppose any act passed by the parliament.

“Granting citizenship is a matter that comes under the purview of Centre. Who has given you the right to challenge the CAA. This has been done as a part of your appeasement policy and vote bank politics,” said leader of opposition Gulab Chand Kataria in the assembly. On excluding Muslims from CAA, he said, “Yeh Koi Dharamshalla nahin ki sabko daal do (India is not a free place to accommodate anyone).”

Supporting the CAA, Kataria said, “We should sincerely think how Hindu minority is being harassed and supressed in Pakistan and if these people apply for Indian citizenship they should be given it respectfully,” he said.

Former education minister Vasudev Devnani questioned Congress of even having an idea of the pain caused to the refugees from Pakistan. “I am the victim of the religious persecution in Pakistan as my family had to flee leaving behind our culture, history and spiritual abode. The stories of partition and persecution heard from my elders are still fresh in my memory. What BJP did was to make the procedure of citizenship bit easier and convenient for the minorities from across the border. And what Congress did was a historical blunder which the people of the country will never forgive him,” said Devnani.

MLA from Ramganj Mandhi Madan Dilwar minced no words in attacking the government in the parliament. He said, “I am openly challenging the government to try and make a law against the implementation of CAA in the state,” said Dilawar, who called the passing of a resolution means ‘nothing’ in the federal system.

Subramanian Swamy

SURAT: Senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has said that India requires to maintain GDP of 10% for a decade if it wants to overtake China. For that, the first thing India needs to do is to abolish Income Tax, he asserted.

Addressing a large gathering at the session on India Rising-Future Economic Outlook organised by the Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) at Sarsana on Saturday, Swamy lamented that the country’s economy is in bad shape for the past couple of years and the GDP is continuously down sliding.

“PM Narendra Modi focused on Ujwala, toilets and cleanliness, but on the other hand our factories are shutting down and the unemployment is rising. This is a big challenge and the economic policies are needed to be framed in right perspective,” he said.

The senior leader further said, “I have been writing letters to PM Modi since 2015 on the economic policies, but he is not listening. It may be because, I am the ‘Jamai’ (brother-in-law) as my wife is from Gujarat. I am ready to give the blueprint for the economic success” said Swamy.

“If India successfully achieves 10% GDP for one decade at least, it will overtake China and challenge the US in the next 20 years,” Swamy asserted.

India is a superpower when it comes to young population with average age of 26 years, he said. He added that 70% of the population is below 35 years of age. In America, it is 47 years, followed by China 35 years and Japan is 50 years, he explained.

“India is full of potential and talent. Our expert minds are going in foreign countries and achieving big milestones in technology, research and other areas. We have lost our resources and they have to be brought back,” Swamy said.

Coming down heavily on the protests against the Citizen Amendment Act (CCA) going on in the country, Swamy said, “The CAA protests across the country are fake and sponsored by foreign powers, who wants to spread fear among the people. This is a conspiracy against India’s development. There is no such section where the BJP has decided on its own and brought to the Parliament.”

“Our constitution is of Hindu Rashtra. There are sections for cow slaughter, giving encouragement to Sanskrit, Uniform Civil Code etc. Only BJP can protect the integrity of this country,” Swamy said, adding that Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are Islamic states and are not secular like India.

“Muslims have not come as refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan as all these countries are Islamic. However, when the list was made there were no Muslims. There were 25,000 Hindus, 5,000 Sikh, 1,000 Christian, two each of Buddhist and Parsi,” he added.

Jaipur: On the 10th National Voters' Day, Governor Kalraj Mishra on Saturday said if every voter realises his/her fundamental duties and follows them, the pillar of democracy will be strengthened further and called upon the younger generation and the newly-registered voters to play an important role in it.

Mishra said that the National Voters' Day was a proud moment for Indian democracy. ""To strengthen the democratic traditions, the Election Commission is not only encouraging wide participation of the voters, but is also creating awareness, promoting fairness and lawful voting,"" the Governor said at the function of the 10th National Voters' Day held at HCMRIPA in Jaipur on Saturday. The poster of 'Election Literacy-Enabled Democracy' was also released.

""In order to connect the youth with the voting process, registered literacy clubs should be opened in all higher education institutions and regular meetings must be held,"" he added.

The Governor said that National Voters' Day is a unique attempt to inculcate a feeling among the people that as long as any eligible person is away from the process, the democracy cannot achieve its objective.

""The message of the commission is very clear that it will not stop until the last eligible person is engaged in the voting process,"" Mishra added.

He also stressed on making the voters of the cities more aware. ""The celebration of democracy cannot succeed without everyone's participation,"" he said. He also appealed to all political parties, social organizations, NGOs, corporates and the media to lend all possible support in this ""sacred work"".

JODHPUR: The high court on Saturday issued notices to the state government and district collectors of three districts, while allowing a PIL by the farmers affected by submergence area of Matrikundiya dam in Chittorgarh district .

The affected farmers, after having knocked every possible door praying for relief, moved the high court with the PIL and sought relief by demanding that directions be issued for safeguarding their agricultural land affected by the dam water. The PIL has sought a fresh survey to estimate the damages caused to them by the dam water since its construction and directions for acquisition of the land of affected farmers falling under the catchment and submergence area of the dam.

According to the counsel for petitions, Shyam Paliwal, Matrikundiya dam was constructed at the confluence of Bhilwara, Rajsamand and Chittorgarh in 1974 as an extension of the Meja Dam of Bhilwara in order to meet the water needs of Hindustan Zink Ltd and Meja Dam primarily.

“The dam has been receiving water to its full capacity almost every year, due to which the crops of the farmers in the area have suffered consistently. This has turned into huge losses to the farmers, who are solely dependent on farming and cattle rearing,” said Paliwal adding that not a single penny in the form of compensation has ever been disbursed to these aggrieved farmers.

COLVA: NCP MLA Churchill Alemao said that he would move a resolution in the assembly against CAA, but would continue to support the BJP government in the state.

The Benaulim MLA said his support to the BJP government in the state has always been issue-based. “Union home minister Amit Shah is hell-bent on implementing CAA and there is no assurance from him that NRC will not follow CAA,” he said during a press conference on Saturday.

At least 70% of Goans have travelled abroad and a large percentage have opted for Portuguese passports for the sake of employment and better quality of life, but in case of any eventuality, they have to come back to their motherland, and they cannot be treated as outsiders, he said. The government has taken over evacuee and enemy properties belonging to Goans who failed to return to Goa within the stipulated time to claim the same, and a similar situation is going to arise if CAA and NRC is implemented in Goa, Alemao said.

Asked whether he would withdraw his support to the government if it does not allow his resolution, he said, for a resolution to be move, he needs the support of other members of the House. He said there is no reason for him to withdraw support as his has always been ‘conditional support’ and in this matter, he is not with the government.

Representative image

MANGALURU: The roads of Dakshina Kannada witness six deaths every week due to road accidents . Interestingly, Mangaluru is the worst among tier-2 cities in Karnataka when it comes to rash and negligent driving leading to deaths.

According to data, Mangaluru city commissionerate alone recorded 1,028 accidents in 2019, out which 20 per cent were fatal, and similar accidents take place in Dakshina Kannada district police jurisdictions. As many as 293 people were killed in 266 fatal accidents in Dakshina Kannada in 2019.

However, data also shows that deaths as well as number of accidents are decreasing every year due to traffic enforcement. Five years ago (in 2015), 373 people were killed in 345 fatal accidents in the district.

Dakshina Kannada superintendent of police B M Laxmi Prasad , who recently conducted a study on accidents in Dakshina Kannada district police limits, pointed out that road accident deaths on national highways, state highways and major district roads take place due to riders not wearing helmets, drunken driving, use of mobile phone while driving, sudden lane change while speeding, due to speeding and pedestrians being run over by vehicles.

People killed in poorly lit areas in DK district limits

“After implementation of a higher penalty for not wearing helmets and other traffic violations, over three months, police have noticed an increase of pedestrian deaths in Dakshina Kannada district police limits.

People have been killed in places where there is poor lighting, which includes national highways, state highways and mofussil areas,” said Laxmi Prasad.

He added that there is no direct correlation between the amount of fine charged and accidents. So police are now changing focus to enforcement, which is specific to reasons for death.

The year 2018 has seen the least number of deaths in many years, because the two major national highways—Sampaje and Gundya-Shirady— are closed during monsoon due to landslides.

“In Dakshina Kannada police limits, overall, there is a 24% reduction in fatal accidents from 2017. Recently, we have given details to the PWD and NHAI to fix black spots on the road and to add safety features. We have also requested for more number of speed cameras and speed guns for better traffic enforcement,” said Laxmi Prasad.

Jay walking too a killer

In Mangaluru city police commissionerate, the main cause for road accidents are rash and negligent driving and skidding of vehicles.

A study on traffic accidents in city limits by the postgraduate department of criminology and forensic science of School of Social Work, Roshni Nilaya, showed that 47.6 percentage of victims of road accidents were drivers or riders of other vehicles.

About 29.5 percentage of pedestrians were victims to road accidents as they do not cross on the zebra crossing, some tend to walk on the middle of the road and due to rash driving, pedestrians are run over.

A total 10.2 per cent of road accidents resulted in deaths. In 2018, 1,172 accident cases were registered out which 167 were fatal, in which 167 people died, including 63 pedestrians. The results were the outcome of traffic accident data of 2018.

Devendra alias Bunty Mishra, 26, Swapnil alias Nandu Rane, 28, and Mahendra alias Dharmedra Kothari, 27, were nabbed by police from Kadodara on Saturday and a country-made pistol and two knives were recovered from their possession. They had escaped to Kaodadara in the same autorickshaw in which they had come to shoot Sachin to death.

Police investigation revealed that Devendra, a history-sheeter, and Sachin were lodged in Lajpor Central Jail (LCJ) after their arrest in different cases. “They fought over some issue in the jail and Sachin had thrashed Devendra in the presence of other prisoners. Devendra wanted to take revenge for the thrashing and hence planned the murder,” police said.

After Sachin came out of the jail, Devendra used to visit Pandesara regularly to locate him. The accused were carrying two knives with them to stab Sachin in case the pistol failed or missed the target. The victim was shot in neck to ensure that he died.

Battling subdued demand following slowdown pressures, businesses and industries are looking forward to the ensuing general budget with great hopes. Industry stakeholders are expecting a slew of announcements and steps to boost demand and provide impetus to economic growth. TOI brings what industries with Gujarat as their stronghold are expecting from the Budget, which is scheduled to be presented by the Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1.

Pharma wants support for R&D, APIs

Research and Development (R&D) is a key to India’s growth in the pharmaceutical sector. To encourage R&D, the government provides weighted tax deduction of 150% for any capital and revenue expenditure incurred on in-house R&D by a company. Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (IDMA) has asked the finance minister to raise the limit to 200% or 250% or to a feasible level.

Secondly, R&D incentives are offered to units approved by the department of scientific and industrial research (DSIR). Smaller and medium units, however, do not get such benefits. The industry has asked the government to cover SMEs by easing the criteria for such sops.

Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) or bulk drugs manufacturing needs support if India is to reduce growing dependence on China for APIs. “There is a need to formulate a policy or scheme on a priority basis to boost manufacturing of APIs in India,” said Viranchi Shah, chairman, IDMA-Gujarat.

The industry has also requested for an alternative mechanism to cover loss of GST on physician samples or expired goods. Pharma firms have to return ITC on these goods.

Reduce import duty on gold, diamonds

India is the world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing centre where diamonds retrieved from old jewellery come for re-cutting. The industry has demanded reduction in the import duty on diamonds and gemstone from 7.5% to 2.5%.

After the hike in the duty last year, the current imports of cut and polished diamonds have come down to less than US $500 million from US $1 billion in 2017-18. “Re-cutting of diamonds is a big business in India, but the high import duty is a major challenge. The trading of diamonds is also hampered due to high import duty,” said Colin Shah vice-chairman, Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC).

The industry has also demanded reduction in the import duty on gold and other metals from 12.5% to 4% to stop the illegal smuggling of gold from other channels and undue blockage of working capital of small and medium jewellery exporters.

K K Sharma, CEO of Surat Hira Bourse (SHB) said, “India has the highest import duty on gold in the world. With GST, the duty on gold comes to around 15%. The government has to seriously think of reducing it to promote exports.”

MMF sector pitches for curbs on cheap imports

Surat is the country’s largest manufacturer of man-made fabrics (MMF) with the annual production pegged at Rs 35,000 crore. The industry wants 10% import duty imposed on cheap fabrics from Vietnam, China and Bangladesh.

Countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh enjoy Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status with the provision to have free trade of major textile commodities including MMF and silk fabrics. Ashish Gujarati, president of Pandesara Weavers Association (PWA) said, “Cheap import of fabrics have put the domestic industry in doldrums. The fabrics manufactured in Surat and other places have become non-competitive.”

The industry has also demanded 40% subsidy under the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (TUFS) as against current 10% to promote modernization in the MMF sector.

Jitu Vakharia, president, South Gujarat Textile Processors Association (SGTPA) said, “The production cost is very high due to electricity tariff, anti-dumping duty on yarns etc. We want the government to make policy changes for the textile sector.”

Dairy majors hope for more allocation, tax benefits

Dairy majors like Amul and National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) have sought higher budgetary allocation as well as ‘priority sector’ status for dairy and animal husbandry. They have also demanded that income earned from dairying be exempted from income tax. Currently, income from agriculture defined in Section 2 (1A) of the Income Tax Act does not mention “dairy farming” as agricultural operation because of which dairy farmers are taxed.

“Dairying and animal husbandry contributes 27% to the total agriculture GDP. Hence, we believe that the budget should be at least Rs 37,412 crore for the sector. If the sector gets the required thrust, we will be able to achieve the target of doubling farmers’ income,” said R S Sodhi, MD, Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), which markets Amul brand.

Amul has also sought steps to remove the disparity between cooperatives and corporates. “The corporate tax rate was reduced from 30% to 22% in the previous full budget. The benefit, however, is not extended to cooperative societies like ours,” added Sodhi.

“Also, we are looking for support for grid connected solar irrigation pump and biogas/slurry production schemes on cooperative model to help the dairy sector sustain its growth momentum in coming years,” said Dilip Rath, chairman, NDDB

Ceramic industry demands inclusion of natural gas in GST

The ceramic tiles industry has demanded that the government should bring natural gas under the ambit of Goods and Services Tax (GST). “If natural gas is brought under GST, the tile makers will get input tax credit (ITC) on gas consumed. We do not get any tax rebate currently on value added tax (VAT) levied on gas, which accounts for 30-35% of the total production cost,” said Nilesh Jetpariya, president, Wall Tiles Division, Morbi Ceramics Association (MCA).

The industry players also want a dedicated export promotion council for ceramic industry. Morbi has been declared as “The Town of Export Excellence”. However, it has not received any benefit from the declaration. Tile makers are seeking announcement of special package for sprucing up infrastructure in the town.

More work needs to be done to promote EV

The budget announcements will provide the key to setting the tone for 2020 for the automotive industry. “The government’s recent announcements on the promotion of EVs in India, especially for government use and public transport, is encouraging. However, we feel that more work needs to be done to promote EV adoption in India not only in public transport but among private customers as well,” said Rajeev Chaba, president & managing director - MG Motor India.

“It should also look at providing incentives to stakeholders for sourcing critical raw materials for EV battery manufacturing in India. This will enable a strong EV-centric ecosystem and will be beneficial for the long-term growth of this high-potential space,” he added.

“The textile industry provides the highest employment in the country. We want the import of cheap fabrics to be stopped to protect the domestic industry.” Bharat Gandhi, chairman, Federation of Indian Art Silk Weaving Industry (FIASWI)

“Enhancement of weighted tax deduction on R&D to 200% will enable new discoveries and innovations. Proper financial support from technology upgradation fund for pharma SMEs will help them graduate to the next level and become exporters.” Mahendra Patel, MD, Lincoln Pharmaceuticals Ltd.

“We hope the government is watching the tumble in our export numbers and heeds our long-standing request for duty reduction on gold and cut and polished diamonds and gemstones.” Colin Shah, vice-chairman, Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC).

“The major challenge for small and medium diamantaires is to get loans from banks. Our request is to make a banking policy where diamantaires can get loans for their businesses.” Babu Kathiriya, president, Surat Diamond Association (SDA).

""We hope that the government provides the right policy, incentives, and charging infrastructure to put more EVs on the road.” Rajeev Chaba, president & MD, MG Motor India.

“We have asked government to set up a dedicated export promotion council for ceramic industry. Unlike other sectors, ceramic has shown a growth in exports.” Nilesh Jetpariya, president, Wall Tiles Division, Morbi Ceramics Association (MCA).

“We are looking for policies aimed at scientific farming in unutilized ‘gauchar land’ so that farmers can get proper fodder as well as schemes to promote biogas production. Also, the thrust should be on ensuring that every village has banking facilities and there should be a digital ecosystem which supports direct payment to farmers.” Amit Vyas, MD, Amul Dairy

“Consider reduction in GST rates on ghee and flavoured milk, dairy-related equipment and breeding inputs, remove customs duty on follicular stimulating hormone and cattle germplasm and increase custom duty on all categories of whey.” Dilip Rath, chairman, NDDB

He accused the Aam Aadmi Party government of not only failing to keep its promises, but also supporting those who wanted to break the country.

Kejriwal has given poisonous air and water to the people of Delhi.”Promising the slum dwellers two-room pucca houses, he also attacked Kejriwal for delaying and blocking the Union government’s action to regularise the unauthorised colonies. “Modiji wrote to Kejriwal in 2015 and 2017 for the list of the colonies. He said it would take two years. When Modiji came to power in 2019, we identified the colonies through satellite mapping and started the process of regularising them,” he said.Attacking Rahul Gandhi and Kejriwal in the same breath, Shah said they supported those who raised anti-national slogans in JNU. Kejriwal government didn’t permit prosecution to those who raised slogans to break the country, he added. “Mauni Baba, Rahul Baba and Kejriwal, you can abuse me and my party, but abusing the country will not be tolerated.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah in his campaign rallies at Badli and Bawana on Saturday night said that Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi through their vote bank politics had made Delhi unsafe for everyone. He accused the Aam Aadmi Party government of not only failing to keep its promises, but also supporting those who wanted to break the country. Shah also attacked AAP for opposing the abrogation of Article 370 and questioning the “surgical strike.”

“Your vote on February 8 will not only ensure the future of Delhi but also the security of the country,” said Shah.

Attacking Kejriwal for not delivering on his promises of setting up 1,000 schools, 50 colleges and buying 5,000 DTC buses, apart from providing clean water, Shah said: “The status of education has worsened. Kejriwal has given poisonous air and water to the people of Delhi.”

Promising the slum dwellers two-room pucca houses, he also attacked Kejriwal for delaying and blocking the Union government’s action to regularise the unauthorised colonies. “Modiji wrote to Kejriwal in 2015 and 2017 for the list of the colonies. He said it would take two years. When Modiji came to power in 2019, we identified the colonies through satellite mapping and started the process of regularising them,” he said.

Attacking Rahul Gandhi and Kejriwal in the same breath, Shah said they supported those who raised anti-national slogans in JNU. Kejriwal government didn’t permit prosecution to those who raised slogans to break the country, he added. “Mauni Baba, Rahul Baba and Kejriwal, you can abuse me and my party, but abusing the country will not be tolerated. Delhi will decide whether it will vote for tukde tukde supporters or those who want to put them in jail.”

VADODARA: A casual labourer was arrested on Saturday for killing his wife over petty issue in forests of Naswadi taluka of Chhota Udepur district last Sunday.

The accused Arvind Nayka admitted of murdering his wife Kokila (42) to the deceased’s brother Ramesh, when the latter went to inquire about her whereabouts.

Police said that the husband and wife had a bitter quarrel following which she came to her father’s house at Pala village around three weeks back.

On January 19, Arvind, who lives in Bodeli , went to meet his wife.

After waiting at Pala for a few hours, Arvind asked Kokila to tag along to a health centre in Naswadi as his health is not fine.

The duo left for Naswadi but on the way, they had another round of argument when Arvind asked for money for treatment from Kokila and she said that she was not carrying any.

Arvind slapped her a couple of times and Kokila started to run away from there but fell at a distance. In a fit of rage, Arvind strangulated her to death and then went back to his home.

When Kokila did not return home, her father Shankar called up Arvind and asked about her, he gave him vague answers. Shankar then asked Ramesh to come home and help him find Kokila.

Ramesh was working as a farm labourer in Surendranagar .

On reaching home on Friday, Ramesh went to meet Arvind where the latter admitted of murdering his wife.

Ramesh and other villagers found Kokila’s decomposed body in the forest late on Friday evening.

An offence of murder was registered against Arvind and he was arrested on Saturday.

Shanti Dhariwal

JAIPUR: Parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal , who is known for his knowledge, wit and straight forward replies in the assembly, took a jibe at BJP on Saturday while moving a resolution against Citizenship (Amendment) Act. He laid emphasis on consolidating the secular structure of India.

Recalling the film Baiju Bawara’s bhajan ‘Man Tadpat Hari Darshan Ko Aaj’, Dhariwal said, “Do you remember who is the lyricist of this bhajan? Do you remember who composed the music for it and who has sung it?” Replying to own question, he said, “The lyrics were by Shakeel Badayuni, the music composition of this melodious bhajan is by Naushad and it was sung by Mohammad Rafi.” “You should remember Bade Ghulam Ali who had sung ‘Hari Om Tatsat’. How can you discriminate with these people,” he said. “So, this is the beautiful structure of this country. Where will you send talents like these?,” he asked.

While talking about Ustad Bismillah Khan the famous Shehnai player who spent most of his time in Varanasi, he said, “Once a delegation of a university from America came to book Khan saab for a music concert for the USA. He did not accept it saying he only plays on the bank of Ganga. To this the organisers said that they will create a set depicting bank of Ganga on the stage in America while he would participate there.” “To this Bismillah Khan denied to participate and said how will they bring the flow of water on the stage? This is the beauty of this country and such bills are an attempt to damage the secular structure of our country,” he said.

Commenting on the growing confusion over bringing the certificates for place of birth and others, he said, “My grandfather was on the way from Bhilwara to Kota along with my pregnant grandmother. On the way my grandmother gave birth to my father in a farm.” “Ab kahan se laon certificate,” he said while the Congress legislators applauded him for the remark.

The wedding card with slogan supporting CAA and NRC

JAIPUR: While protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) have intensified across the country, a family from Sikar has come up with slogans in support of the CAA and NRC, on one of their member’s marriage card.

The father of the groom, a tea vendor, has not only printed slogans supporting the Act on the wedding card of his son, but has also urged people to vote for the BJP and Narendra Modi as a gift to his son and daughter-in-law, whose wedding is to be solemnized on February 9. The family has also invited Prime Minister Modi and home minister Amit Shah for the wedding.

Amit Khandelwal (27), who has done his master’s in commerce and is presently running an e-mitra kiosk in Sikar, while talking to TOI on Saturday said, “Due to lack of knowledge, people are protesting against the CAA and NRC everywhere. They are only protesting against the possibilities. Our family supports the CAA and NRC, thus I planned to get a card published with these slogans. It will inspire more people.”

The family has also put a photo of the Prime Minister on the wedding card. “Some people are misleading the country and are indulging in violent protests. I urge people to maintain peace and harmony,” he added.

Khandelwal is the eldest son of Mohan Lal Khandelwal, who runs a tea stall and a flour mill in Sikar town. “Rather than creating confusion, people should appreciate what Modiji and Amit Shahji are doing for the country. I hope our small act will inspire many,” said Mohan Lal.

The family has also sent the wedding invitation card to the PM and the home minister. “We had sent it by registered post and have also received the acknowledgement confirming the receipt of these cards,” said Mohan Lal.

Nagpur: Who doesn’t love the traditional authentic meals? Even though there are plenty of mobile apps, restaurants and hotels across the city that are ready to dish out hotel-esque food, there is something about traditional home-made food that triggers an unmatched craving.

To fulfil such cravings, city’s homemakers have donned the hat of chefs and are catering to foodies across the city.

Gone are the days when the finger-licking taste of dishes like dal baati or maccher jhol were restricted to the walls of the kitchen. Such traditional dishes are now just a click away, thanks to the homemakers who are now showcasing their expertise from their ‘cloud kitchens’ and selling the dishes on an online website called ‘Native chefs’.

‘Native chefs’ is providing a unique platform to these housewives who were always passionate to cook tasty food but never got a chance to showcase their expertees in front of the world. TOI had reported in 2018 how the start-up being steered by Leena Dixit is giving wings to homemakers. Two years later, the success stories continue to roll out of the kitchens.

For the foodies, there is a potpourri of dishes to choose from — right from Hyderabadi biryani to spicy Nagpur-style Saoji, from Bengali maccher jhol to Maharashtrian kalari patodi. The chefs go through well-defined selection process to ensure only the best authentic meal arrive at your doorstep.

One of the chefs, Sunita Prakash, used to dish out delicious litti chokas only for her family. After joining Native Chefs, she is catering to people across the city. “I am a passionate cook. People in Nagpur now recognize me as someone who specializes in cooking delicious Bihari meal. I have an identity of my own,” she says.

More than 60 chefs are working from their homes and over 150 dishes are exhibited on the online website. Rohini Deshkar specializes in plating what she calls ‘a piece of Maharashtra’. Her saoji and sambar wadi are two of the most popular dishes on the website. “I love to cook and feed people. Those who order food are getting to enjoy masala bhat, sev ki sabji, patodi and much more from my kitchen,” she says.

A Punjabi chef, Kareena Khurana’s butter chicken and Punjabi-style soya chap are a hit. “Native chef gave me a perfect opportunity to roll out Punjabi dishes from my kitchen to other people’s dining table. It also acts as a source of income but the satisfaction of feeding people is immeasurable,” Kareena says.

It’s not just the spicy, masala meals that are on offer at the website. Jennifer Estiberio, a Goan chef, is satisfying the sweet craving by baking tempting cakes. “I get multiple orders in a day and feedbacks from my clients are my true rewards. I make teatime cakes and fudgy chocolate balls that are always in demand,” Jennifer says.

Home-cooked fish by Moushmi Shome is getting many thumbs-up as well. “I cook every meal with atmost love. For us (housewives), it’s an opportunity to bond over food and traditions,” says Shome.

Leena Dixit, founder of Native Chef, says, “I presented this idea of start-up in IIM Bangalore and out of 100, nine got selected and mine was one of them. I started Native Chef in August 2018 and the journey has been amazing so far.”

Madurai: Fencing and road works have begun at the site selected for the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Madurai nearly a year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the Rs 1,264 crore hospital.

An area of 201.75 acres has been allocated for the construction of the premier hospital-cum-research institute in Madurai. Even after completion of formalities for the land acquisition, work remained dormant and no construction was initiated at the site since the stone-laying on January 27, 2019.

The hospital is located off the Bangalore-Kanyakumari national highway. Sources said that the works to be carried out initially will include those of roads, which are important for transporting construction material. Till now, it had a narrow stretch of road. This is being converted into a two-lane road from the highway for 6 kilometres till Karadikkal beyond the AIIMS site. On the other side, the second road from Koothiargundu junction to the AIIMS hospital site is being laid as a four-lane structure for 3.5 kms. The works are being carried out from the central government’s road fund to the tune of Rs 21 crore.

As of now, the work on the construction wall and precast concrete fencing is being carried out by NHAI. The pillars are erected and the precast wall structures are slipped into them and plastered with concrete. These walls are easier and faster to install and can be removed and replaced as the structure expands, they said. The compound wall would be installed for a length of 5.5 km around the site, said sources. A loan from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is awaited to start the works on the hospital building. Only basic groundwork has been initiated now, said sources.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission has served a notice to BJP’s Hari Nagar candidate, Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga, over a video song, seeking to know why its expenditure should not be added to his poll expenses. The rap song ‘Bagga Bagga Har Jagah’ was released on social media by Bagga soon after the saffron party announced his candidature.

I did not use any funds for the promotion of the song, which was released by my personal account. My lawyer will give a reply to the notice,” Bagga said, adding that he respects the EC notice.

Bagga further said that the song does not mention about Hari Nagar constituency and also does not seek votes for BJP.

VADODARA: Five students from the city featured in top 25 by bagging All India Ranks (AIRs) in the exams of the company secretaries (CS) foundation programme of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI).

The computer-based examination of CS foundation was held in December, results of which were declared on Saturday.

Ruchi Agrawal, who topped the city’s list who placed in AIR 2 with 90% marks in CS foundation. A first year student of bachelors of commerce (B Com) from M S University’s faculty of commerce, Ruchi is now preparing to clear both her bachelors and two other levels of CS – executive and professional.

“I am planning to pursue MBA in marketing after CS,” said Ruchi, who lost her mother Neelam due to kidney failure last year. Daughter of businessman Rakesh Agrawal , Ruchi received support of her father and other members of her joint family in pursuing her studies.

Another first year BCom student, Abbas Sabuwala ranked AIR 8 with 87% marks. Abbas, whose father Aliasgar owns an electric shop while mother Munira is a homemaker, wants to pursue LLB after finishing his CS and BCom studies. “I believe I can be good in pursuing law,” said Abbas.

94,['26/01/2020'],Fire destroys old building at Kanyakumari med college,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Madurai: Scores of patients, attendants, doctors and other hospital staff at the Kanyakumari Government Medical College and Hospital at Asaripallam in Nagercoil had tense moments on Saturday when a fire broke out in a building where scrap and packing materials were stored. The incident took place around 8.30 am in an old tiled roof structure about 300 feet from the labour ward and the outpatient buildings.

Preliminary inquiry by the fire and rescue services personnel and the hospital authorities has led to the suspicion that it could have spread to the building from dry grass and bushes around it when someone carelessly disposed a match stick after lighting a cigarette or a cigarette butt. Fire and smoke engulfed the place in no time.

A team of 10 fire and rescue services personnel from the Nagercoil fire station rushed to the spot with two fire tenders and fought the flames from 9 am to 12 noon to put off the flames. Station fire officer M Thurai who led the operation said that they used five loads of water to put out the fire and that the building was razed to the ground using an earthmover as the already old structure was weakened by the fire.

The nearly 2,000 sq.ft building is a British structure that has not been frequently used by hospital staff and not at all used by patients. It existed from the time when a tuberculosis hospital was established on the premises before the medical college and hospital was set up. It was used to store scrap and packing materials such as cardboard boxes and plastic cans, which fuelled the fire. Hospital dean R Suganthy told TOI that the scrap stored is annually auctioned by the pharmacy unit, which is independent from the hospital administration, during February and March. The dean said that the building that was damaged by the fire is among the more than 10 such old and unused structures on the premises. Suganthy added that more than 60% of the 110-acre premises is covered by a thick cover of shrubs and has a forest like feel. She said that they were clearing the bushes manually from time to time but they need help from the PWD to clear the major portion.

Madurai: Madurai couple M Karuppaiah, 49, and his wife K Chitra, 51, is all set to begin a 1,000 km walking-cum-cycling yatra to spread Gandhian ideologies on the 70th Republic Day from Erode to Hyderabad. The couple who claim to have completed nearly 86,000 km across the country for this cause in 30 expeditions said that the one on January 26 which will be the last in this fashion.

Following the demise of their spouses, the duo got married in a modern swayamvaram held in Tirupur in 2000. They started walking and cycling together in 2001, covering 1,600 km from Madurai to Chennai. “Our longest expedition was 11,500 km across India from Virudhunagar in 270 days in 2003,” Karuppaiah said.

During their Madurai to Attari Waha border expedition in March 2010, they were resting below a tree at Vasanthapura near Ludhiana when a car went berserk and knocked down Chitra. “I suffered multiple fractures and was hospitalized, bedridden, for four months. Upset over the incident my son died. I was unable to walk for two more months. But we were determined to spread the message and resumed walking six months later,” she recalled. The couple said that a few years ago they covered 80 to 100 km a day by cycle but ageing has reduced it to 50 to 70 km a day by cycle or not more than 30 km on foot. Staying at public places, they set off with Gandhian caps and wearing hand-woven clothes around 7 to 8 am. Spreading the message on Gandhian ideologies on national integration, religious harmony, total prohibition, terror-free India and women empowerment and on new education policy and linking of rivers they halt at sunset. While Karuppaiah can converse in Tamil, Hindi and English, Chitra is fluent in Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam, making it easy for the couple to share the message pan India. They also carry pamphlets and small banners.

Back home at Andipatti Bungalow village near Usilampatti where they spend close to half a year – apart from their yatra – they run a petty shop and also sell textiles and cottage industry items door to door for a living. On Sunday they will set off from the Gandhi temple at Senthampalayam in Erode district and complete their yatra at the Hyderabad Gandhi Bhavan on March 12 – the 90th anniversary of the Salt Satyagraha.

100,['26/01/2020'],12 suspended for ‘lifting lid off’ NU paper leak,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Nagpur: In a bizarre case, a prominent engineering college on Wardha Road had allegedly suspended around 12 first-semester students who complained to their principal that the engineering chemistry paper was leaked 15 days prior to the Nagpur University (NU) exam for the subject. They were reinstated a couple of days back.

The question paper, which is common for all first-semester engineering branches in NU, was allegedly leaked on the pretext of revision and class test.

Though authorities from St Vincent Palloti College are tight-lipped about the entire episode, sources said that the suspension seems to be a result of students confronting the college “for not sharing the paper with them”.

As per their complaint lodged with the principal, the students said they got “low marks” while those from the section in which the paper was leaked have comfortably passed with ‘good marks’ after declaration of NU results.

Both the internal and university question papers are word for word same. TOI has in its possession copies of the papers. TOI posed several queries to the authorities but they remained unanswered till going to the press.

St Vincent Palloti College principal Surendra Gole and vice-principal Rajendra Gowardhan didn’t answer to TOI’s calls and messages. Vice-chancellor SP Kane and director of examinations and evaluation Prafulla Sabale too didn’t answer TOI’s calls and messages.

This is the second such case where the university paper was allegedly leaked days in advance on the pretext of class test and revision.

The model question paper of Kamla Nehru College of Pharmacy at Butibori, given on December 6, 2019, and the NU paper held on December 24, were same. So far, the university is yet to take any action in this case.

In the Palloti case, the internal paper carries detailed solutions for all questions. It was first leaked on November 22, 2019, and later circulated on class WhatsApp group a day before the NU exam on December 7. The students lodged the complaint on December 30 and they were suspended around January 12.

In their complaint, the students said they were shocked to see striking similarities in the university question paper and the model paper given to them some days before the exam. A day before the paper, the same model question paper was circulated on WhatsApp group. Some students had saved the model paper prepared in handwriting of the class counsellor.

The same evening the aggrieved students had complained about the incident through the suggestion box of the college but no action was initiated.

After all their papers were over, the students mailed the question papers demanding strict action against the counsellor. The administration identified the students and suspended them, a move the students claimed was aimed at “silencing them”.

What happened

Nov 22 | St Vincent Palloti College of Engineering first-semester counsellor gives hand-written model question paper to students of her class for revision

Dec 21 | The same model paper with complete solutions is circulated on class WhatsApp group

Dec 22 | NU engineering chemistry exam is held. Other students find the model paper and university paper word for word same

Many students at Wuhan University have left the city using these facilities and Indian students have sought authorities help to arrange private vehicles to help them reach nearest airports.“The Government of India can negotiate with the Chinese authorities to arrange flights to take us back home. If countries like the US and France have ordered evacuation, it shows the bleak picture. We are facing food shortage too as most shops are shut and our food provisions are running low,” said Faizal Naser , a final year medical student. He said that he speaks on behalf of fellow Indian students who are desperate to leave Wuhan.The students also expressed concern about misleading reports coming from Kerala that authorities were not keen about bring them home as it could lead to the spreading of virus. However, on cross verification, it was found that such reports were false.Meanwhile, it is learnt that around more than 25 Keralite students from Wuhan University have managed to leave the city and are expected to reach Kerala over the next days.

Chennai: When regular clients visit businessman Suresh Kannan’s factory in Chennai, he usually presents them with a treat box as a token of appreciation. But of late, it’s not boxes of sweets or chocolates that he hands out but gourmet popcorn .

""You get it in assorted flavours, it’s delicious but unique,"" says Kannan, who picks from the Planet Popcorn array, which offers more than 20 flavours, from toffee, cappuccino and garlic butter to chilli oregano, masala masti, and lemon pataka.

From being a humble snack sold in oily little plastic covers in cinema theatre, popcorn has made its way to stores, coffee shops and online platforms. It now graces tamboolams, is gifted by corporates and picked to be party favours.

One of the brands instrumental in giving popcorn its makeover is 4700BC Popcorn. ""We wanted to give popcorn a whole new image, so we traced its history. We discovered it is possibly one of the oldest snacks in the world. It is believed that ‘fossils’ of popcorn were found in the caves of Peru, which dated back to 4700BC, and that’s how we chose our brand name,"" says co-founder Chirag Gupta, adding that they now have seven flavours in retail, and 12 at the store level.

City-based Bharat Ramani launched Planet Popcorn in 2014 after seeing how well gourmet popcorn was doing in southeast Asia. ""When I saw my kids munching on chips, I realised popcorn is a healthier snack option, full of protein, high in fibre and comparatively low in carb,"" says Ramani. ""Since any food has to pass the taste of the tongue before it ends up in the stomach, I thought gourmet popcorn is a good option.""

Today, it has a presence in eight Indian cities and can be ordered online. ""Caramel popcorn is the most popular, but Indians also love spice, so flavours such as Chilli Devil are in demand,"" he says.

Most brands import the corn, usually from the US. And the gourmet snack, now a popular gift option for individuals as well as corporates, has its seasons as well. ""It’s a great alternative to sweets during Christmas, Diwali, Rakhi and Lohri,"" says Diksha M Rai, co-founder and director, The Crunch Box, launched in New Delhi in 2014. ""We supply to school canteens in Delhi like the British School and tie up with Book my Show cafes, and Mukta Cinemas.""

Ramani says it’s popular as return gifts at birthday parties. ""It’s also part of tamboolams at weddings,"" he says.

Popcorn and movies will always go together, and that’s why cinemas now sell popcorn as an experience. ""We stock packaged as well as fresh popcorn, which sells more as customers get to choose their flavour and seasoning. It’s all customised by the customer and it adds to the level of excitement,"" says Swaroop Reddy, regional director (south), PVR Cinemas.

Experts feel the market will grow. ""It’s similar to what happened with ice cream 20 years ago. You could buy it off the street for `5, then bigger brands, and flavours came in,"" says Ramani. ""Popcorn is evolving in India, and people are addicted to it.""

Visakhapatnam: After the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) developed its ‘park for children with all abilities’ on the Beach Road, other smart cities in the country are likely to take a leaf out of the civic body’s book, with officials of the ministry of housing and urban affairs on Saturday requesting CEOs of all 100 smart cities to construct at least one ‘all abilities park ’ in their respective cities.

The announcement was made by Rahul Kapoor, director, Smart Cities Mission on behalf of the secretary, ministry of housing and urban affairs, Durga Shanker Mishra during the wrap-up of the two-day third Apex Conference of Smart Cities in Visakhapatnam.

Mishra, after visiting the park on Friday afternoon, said that about 2.2 per cent of India’s population had some form of disability. “This park is totally dedicated to such children. The park can be accessed by all differently-abled users, including visually-impaired, hearing-impaired, physical disability , etc.” said Mishra.

Under the Smart Cities Mission, the park was retrofitted and had new play equipment installed, with play structures and seating accessible to children of all abilities in its 2,156 square metres area. Earlier, there was no dedicated play area in the park.

These issues were addressed in the retrofitting of the park by utilising available open space in an efficient manner. The GVMC spent about Rs 3.5 crore on the renovation of the park. The topography of the park was realigned for better access and aesthetics for children of all abilities. Since its opening, the park has received a positive public response and has been drawing a large crowd on a daily basis, since its inaugural in 2018.

The delegates, who attended the two-day conference, visited the park on Friday and Saturday and praised the civic body for taking up the initiative.

The delegation also visited the floating solar power project on Mudasarlova reservoir, smart schools developed under the Mission and the City Operations Centre on Saturday.

106,['26/01/2020'],NOISY NAGPUR: Pollution above safe limits everywhere in city,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Nagpur: Noise pollution levels are breaching the permissible decibel marks all across the city, reveals the latest study by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri).

Around two years ago, the institute initiated the country’s first-of-its-kind noise pollution monitoring using bicycles, under the guidance of director Rakesh Kumar. The scientific report for the city shows that out of its 38 wards, 16 recorded dangerously high noise levels — each more than 30 decibels above the World Health Organization-prescribed community guidelines limit of 70 decibels.

At 105.8 decibels, ward 33 from south Nagpur was the noisiest in the city, and ward 35 in south-west Nagpur was the second loudest at 105.6 decibels. Areas on the city’s outskirts were found to be comparatively quieter thanks to plentiful vegetation cover.

The study was carried out at 700 locations in the city, including national and state highways, roads — major, minor and ring, and, industrial, commercial and residential areas. A total of 2.10 lakh readings were analysed by Neeri scientists. It revealed that noise levels all across the city exceed acceptable standards of both, WHO and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

Co-authored by Kumar, principal scientist and head of Mumbai zonal centre Ritesh Vijay and research scholars Vijaya Laxmi, Jaydip Dey and Komal Kalawapudi, the study further highlighted that the maximum levels of average noise were recorded in commercial areas of the city. “This is due to traffic congestion and honking noise at intersections,” it stated.

The minimum levels of average noise, on the other hand, were observed in industrial areas. “Most of the sampling locations were dominated by high noise levels. Only one location in the city recorded noise level below 60 decibels,” the report added.

According to scientists, noise levels have significantly increased in the city in the last 10 years. “Traffic continues to be the biggest source of noise pollution. A change in mindset of the citizens is needed. We should be better aware of traffic rules and use horns judiciously. Also, with the advent of Metro, citizens have a great opportunity to switch from private to public transport,” said Vijay.

The report also suggested mitigation measures to curb the rising noise pollution in the city. “Provision of better public transport system, creating public awareness, reducing honking, changing attitudinal behaviour of drivers, improving traffic management system, street landscaping and roadside plantation are effective ways to minimize noise pollution,” it stated.

As reported by TOI earlier, Neeri conducted the study simultaneously in 10 cities of the state. Apart from Nagpur, it has been completed in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan, Dombivli, Pune, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Solapur and Nashik.

Allahabad: Auto lifters prefer stealing SUVs, but lift cars first to facilitate the crime. The new modus operandi was revealed when a joint team of crime branch and Kydganj police nabbed a high profile auto lifter Waseer Ahmad, alias Ali Ahmad (42), a resident of Pratapgarh, with his accomplice Aditya Tripathi (50) of Mauaima near New Yamuna bridge road on Friday night. Ahmad is accused of stealing more than 100 four-wheelers, including SUVs, across the country.

“Ahmad is expertise in making master keys. He kept changing locations to dodge arrest and was running an inter-state gang in an organised way,” said crime branch officials.

Kydganj SHO Shishu Pal Sharma told TOI, “About a fortnight back, we seized five Boleros, four engines and six chassis of SUVs from a garage on Handia-Saidabad highway. Ahmad’s name cropped up during probe. He was running a gang that lifted SUVs from metro cities.”

“Our joint team was looking for Ahmad who sold stolen SUVs and cars in other states or got them dismantled,” he added. Mumbai and Delhi Police had sought information about Ahmad when his name surfaced in auto lifting cases.

“In half-a-dozen recent SUV theft cases in which we found CCTV footage, we noticed the auto lifters came in four-wheelers since cars, SUVs are generally not stopped during checking drive unless there is specific input. They did recce of posh colonies,” said officials.

They look for SUVs parked on the road and can easily carry the equipment to steal vehicles, said officials.

P Vishal (center) studying medicine at Wuhan University with his colleagues

CHENNAI: It’s been a week since S Palayam’s son had a full meal. P Vishal is one of the medical students from Chennai at Wuhan University, China, stuck in their hostel rooms and dormitories following the government-ordered lockdown of the city since the outbreak of coronavirus.

Many Indian students had come home for the month-long Chinese New Year holidays, but the few who stayed back – especially at Wuhan, which is the centre of the outbreak – are living in fear. The whole city has been quarantined; flights and trains remain cancelled.

Parents in India are desperate to have their wards back home, while they are still healthy. “If there’s a right time to send them back, it is now,” says Palayam, who works as an auto plant serviceman in Chennai. “We speak with our son twice a day, and as a medical student he probably knows the precautions better than we do, but we’ve still asked him to drink turmeric mixed with warm milk every day to keep infections at bay. There’s nothing more we can do now,” he says.

Back in Wuhan, one of the 13 cities in China shut down following the outbreak, Vishal and his friends have been calling the Indian embassy at Beijing at least four times a day, appealing to them to be transported to India. “As it is, we have no access to facilities here. We’re only asked to stay in our rooms, wear masks and not step out. The university has also only given us basic surgical masks. They say if any of us exhibits symptoms, they’ll look into it. But we’re trying to find a way to not fall ill in the first place,” says a student. “One of our friends had a cough a few days back, and it made us all anxious,” he adds.

Following their constant appeal, the canteen at the university has been opened once a day in the evenings, but all restaurants, shops and transport has been shut down.

An intern from Chennai (who asked not to be named) at the Jiangxi medical hospital in Nanchang, says students have been advised not to travel via Wuhan. “The challenge is that a lay person cannot differentiate between influenza, pneumonia and coronavirus, until they collapse,” he says. He, however, says that Nanchang, which has close to 100 students from Tamil Nadu, is safer. “The government has released emergency numbers that are accessible, and the hospital has provided us with masks,” he says.

P Palanivelu, vice-president of China Tamil Community in Guangzhou province that is home to about 1,000 Tamils including 400 medical students, says people are meticulously following precautions. “They wear masks when they head out and don’t consume game meat,” he said.

Coronavirus has spread to Hong Kong, as well, where most Tamil natives are employed in the IT sector. Mohamed Ismail S M K, Tamil cultural association-Hong Kong president, however, said things were normal in Hong Kong.

“People are taking all safety measures and we do not see much panic,” he said.

They said they would not allow him to stay in the state. They also threatened to disrupt his film shootings. Some YouTube channels have uploaded the video of the protest,” the petition said.

PUDUCHERRY: Second additional district judge M Suba Anbumani on Friday sentenced a man to double life term for murdering his live-in partner and their six-month-old child in Puducherry.

The judge also sentenced Prabhakaran, 32, to 10 years in jail for kidnapping his live-in partner and their child and another seven years jail for attempting to cover up the crime by suppressing evidence of the crime. All the terms will run concurrently.

According to the prosecution, Prabhakaran, a flower merchant from Tiruvannamalai was staying in Puducherry leaving his wife and children in his hometown. He befriended an unmarried woman five years older to him in the Union territory.

Hiding his earlier marriage, he began a live-in relationship with the woman identified as K Gunavathy, a few years ago. The couple had a boy. The woman insisted that Prabhakaran marry her after the boy was born.

However, he delayed the marriage citing one reason or the other. Meanwhile, Gunavathy came to know about his first marriage and urged him to marry her immediately. She threatened that she will reveal their relationship to his wife and others, if Prabhakaran does not marry her.

Promising to marry her, Prabhakaran took her and the boy on his bike to Kiliyanur in Villupuram district on November 25, 2017. Reaching a secluded spot, he strangulated both Gunavathy and the child to death. He threw the bodies into the Sitheri dam and returned to Puducherry.

Police registered a case following a missing woman complaint lodged by Gunavathy’s brother and began investigations. Meanwhile, the bodies of a woman and a baby were fished out from the dam by police, who identified that they were Gunavathy and her child.

On interrogation, Prabhakaran confessed to murdering Gunavathy and the boy. Pronouncing the judgment, the judge also slapped a fine of Rs 4,000 on Prabhakaran. Public prosecutor N K Perumal appeared on behalf of the government.

Udupi: The Mangaluru city police brought MIA bomb scare case accused Aditya Rao,36, to Udupi on Saturday. Aditya Rao was arrested on charges for planting a bag containing explosive material near the ticketing counter of Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) on January 20.

A team led by ACP (North) Belliappa K U visited several places across the city, including Karnataka Bank, Kunjibettu branch. Aditya reportedly hired a safe deposit locker at the bank. Sources said that since he did not have the key, the police were forced to break open the locker. The locker contained a few documents and a box. The box has been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for examination. It is suspected that cyanide is stored in the box, stated an official investigating the case.

There have been reports of a family member mentioning that Aditya wanted to commit suicide by consuming cyanide.

Threat call to airport made from Malpe

Police sources informed that after placing the explosive-laden bag near the MIA ticketing counter, Aditya travelled to Malpe.

He made a hoax call to the terminal manager that the Indigo Mangaluru-Bengaluru flight had a bomb in it. He is said to have confessed to the crime. The police are searching for the sim card that he had disposed of.

He reportedly told the police that he made a call while sitting on a bench near an eatery. The shop is located a few kilometres away from the Malpe police station.

After making the hoax call, he threw the sim away and headed towards Bengaluru. The police have searched the area, and in particular around the eatery, for the sim card. Since the shop opens only after 6pm, Aditya who arrived in the afternoon, sat on the bench alone and made the hoax call. Sources stated that he used to work as a cook at a house near the Malpe Vadabhandeshwara Temple, and hence is familiar with the area.

The police then took him to the Malpe police station. He was then taken to a hotel in Karkala in connection with the investigation.

After surrendering before the police in Bengaluru on January 22, he was put in 10-day police custody.

Coimbatore: Members of the Tamil Nadu Highways Road Workers’ Association staged a protest in front of the state highways office on Trichy Road on Saturday, seeking livelihood allowance and other benefits that had been suspended for those who had participated in Jacto-Geo protests last year.

General secretary of the association A Amsaraj said the state highways department had not given livelihood allowance for around 30 workers from Coimbatore, Gobichettipalayam and Pollachi, who had participated in the protests.

“These workers were suspended and disciplinary action was taken against them under Rule 17(b). However, under the rule, the workers should have been given half of their salary as livelihood allowance for the period that they were suspended. But they were not given,” he said.

Besides, five workers from the Nilgiris were not given increments and other benefits for a long time now, he said. These workers were field staff, who were involved in maintenance of roads laid by the state highways. He also alleged irregularities in preparing seniority lists and giving other benefits.

When contacted, superintending engineer of state highways, Coimbatore, S Suresh said the workers would be given livelihood allowances and they had discussed it with the superiors. On the issue of five workers from the Nilgiris not being given increment, he said they had joined service by showing fake certificates. “But instead of suspending them, the court, on humanitarian grounds, had ruled that they should not be given increment for five years,” he said. tnn

JAIPUR: Rajasthan Assembly on Saturday passed a resolution urging the Centre to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act amid opposition by the BJP which accused the ruling Congress of pursuing appeasement politics.It is the third state to pass a resolution against CAA state after Punjab and Kerala. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said, “We have urged the central govt to repeal the law as it discriminates people on religious grounds, which violates the provisions of our Constitution. This is the first time in the history of the nation that a law has been enacted which discriminates people on religious grounds. It violates secular principles of our Constitution and also Article 14 of our Constitution.”“A number of states have been opposing NRC and CAA keeping in mind public opinion at large. It is the duty of the Centre to keep the federal structure intact n strong. I urge the NDA govt to come forward and withdraw the Act. Govt should not make it a prestige issue,” he tweeted. The resolution, which was passed by voice vote, also asked the Centre to withdraw the new questionnaire for preparation of the National Population Register (NPR), 2020 as people would face inconvenience with the proposed additional information.“The preamble of the Constitution clearly states that India is a secular country. It is a basic feature of the Constitution that cannot be changed. However, the CAA, which has been enacted by Parliament, is aimed at distinguishing illegal migrants on the basis of religion. Such discrimination of people on the grounds of the religion is not in consonance with the secular ideas enshrined in the Constitution and is a clear violation of Article 14,” the resolution stated.The resolution has incorporated objections against NPR and NRC and has urged the Centre to start the Census work only after withdrawal of new fields of information that has been sought for updating the NPR.“CAA is clearly violating the provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, the House resolves to urge upon the government of India to repeal the CAA to avoid any discrimination on the basis of religion in granting citizenship and to ensure equality for all religious groups of India,” said Shanti Dhariwal, parliamentary affairs minister, while moving the resolution.Dhariwal also replied to the allegations of BJP legislators who accused the Congress-led government of appeasement by objecting to the CAA. “My grandmother was travelling to Kota from Bhilwara when she gave birth to my father in a field after experiencing labour pain. So, where should I get the birth certificate of my father?” he questioned.Earlier, participating in the debate, state BJP president Satish Poonia said, “CAA to aapke fufaaji ko bhi laago karna padega (Even your uncle will have to implement CAA).”Responding to it, Dhariwal said, “Humne rajtantra bhi dekha, loktantra bhi dekha, ab sanghtanra dekh rahey hain.”Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria also questioned the right to challenge the Act in the assembly. “Granting citizenship is a matter under the Centre and in such a situation do we have the right to challenge the CAA.

CHENNAI: With its bright red painted walls, Nandanam metro station has added colour to the junction. Soon, a few other metro stations too will sport a new look with different colours and popular brands prefixing their names as Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) has started giving out contracts for branding stations to raise additional revenue.

Nearly two months ago, motorists crossing the bustling Nandanam junction would have noticed the walls of the entrances and the ancillary building of Nandanam metro station sporting bright red paint. Officials said contracts were awarded and now The Muthoot Group’s name has been added to the name of the station. “Soon, Teynampet and Thousand Lights will have names of brands,” an official said.

After Nandanam metro station caught the attention of the Chennaiites, officials said many firms have already approached them to affix brand names in the upcoming phase-2 stations. Metrorail officials said they have awarded contracts for renaming and branding of Teynampet and Nandanam metro to Vas Media and Thousand Lights metro station to Spencer Plaza.

“Other firms and brands are showing interest in our phase-2 stations. A private hospital wants to affix its name to the Alwarpet station after it begins operation,” an official said.

While many more stations would soon be renamed with well-known brands, for CMRL, this exercise is one of the avenues to generate non-fare revenue. Space inside and outside stations are also being rented out for setting up retail outlets and restaurants of well-known brands as well as ATMs. Efforts are also under way to award contracts for advertising inside the stations.

“Maximising options to generate non-fare revenue helps in keeping the ticket fares low and operating efficiently,” an official said.

The outer walls of a few metro trains too are covered with stickers of colourful advertisements while the inside walls have slots for brand promotions. Earlier, CMRL floated tenders to sell advertisement space on the pillars of the elevated corridors where brands can install boards with colourful lights. But so far, there seem to be no takers.

While low patronage is cited as one of the reasons for the poor use of ad space in stations and trains, with the opening of another 9km line in North Chennai, CMRL officials said their patronage may go up by 30% which will, in turn, attract more firms and bring additional revenue.

Airlines which fly to destinations where cases have been detected have told their crew to look out for passengers with symptoms of fever and report them to the authorities. If there are patients who are suspected and tested positive, they will be taken to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in the city.The hospital has 10 isolation beds and it can be increased to any number in multiple hospitals if necessary, said Dr K Kolandaisamy, director of public health.A multidisciplinary team comprising a public health expert, clinician and microbiologist will reach Chennai to review end-to-end preparedness for management and control of the virus - thermal screening and transferring of patients to hospitals for isolation. It will also visit tertiary hospitals attached to airports for reviewing the isolation wards and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and masks etc.The team will review whether infection control, surveillance and other guidelines are being followed and will coordinate with the government to support and strengthen preparedness, said a statement from the Union government.Though airports at Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok are screening passengers, airlines are also taking steps to ensure that passengers and crew are safe. Flights from the infected destinations are being fumigated and crew has been told to watch for passengers who show signs of fever. Chennai has direct flight link to Hong Kong and Japan where cases of the virus have been detected. There are around seven flights on weekdays and nine flights on weekends between Chennai and Singapore.Singapore Airlines said, “A health advisory notice by Singapore’s Ministry of Health is being distributed to passengers. We have in place standard operating procedures to handle inflight medical emergencies, including potentially infectious diseases. Any unwell passenger will be attended to by the medical authorities immediately after the aircraft lands. As an added measure, inflight announcements regarding coronavirus will be made on all outbound and inbound flights to Singapore. Surgical masks will also be made available to our crew who operate to affected stations.”In a statement IndiGo airlines, which operates flights to Chengdu and Guangzhou in China, said, “Our crew are taking appropriate precautions. There have been no cases reported yet in our Chinese points, which are around 1,000 km from Wuhan , the centre of the outbreak , nor indeed in India. We are in close touch with the government authorities and will advise of any alterations to our schedule, as and when they occur. Meantime, we have many thousands of forward bookings and are serving those customers as normal.”An airline official said China has stopped all tours of its citizens headed abroad and Cathay Pacific’s subsidiary Cathay Dragon has suspended flights between Wuhan and Hong Kong. “This has come as a relief as it will cut chances of the infection spreading.”Earlier, health minister C Vijayabaskar said airports will continue routine thermal screening of arriving passengers. If patients arriving in Chennai from China show symptoms of flu, they will be taken to the government hospital for treatment. Warning signs for the new strain, like other influenza viruses, includes fever, cough and breathing difficulties, while more advanced cases could lead to pneumonia, kidney failure and death. We always reserve 10 beds in the hospital for quarantine. They will be taken there,” he said.The state has also sent available educational material on the virus to doctors’ bodies to ensure they identify cases early. Tests for the new virus will be sent to National Institute of Virology lab, officials said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/coronavirus-10-bed-facility-ready-at-gh-airlines-airport-step-up-safety-measures/articleshow/73621671.cms
123,['26/01/2020'],Padma Shri a blessing from women I helped: Sayedbhai,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Sayedbhai

PUNE: For five decades, Sayed Mehboob Shah Qadri — alias Sayedbhai — has worked relentlessly to help Muslim women, abandoned by their husbands under triple talaq, stand on their own feet.

On Saturday, Sayedbhai was conferred the prestigious Padma Shri by the Union government. The octogenarian said the award gives him the impetus to continue working for societal reforms and double his efforts to bring in a uniform civil code. “The award is a result of the blessings of the women from across the country, whom I had the chance to help over the past five decades,” he told TOI on Saturday.

Sayedbhai said he personally saw the effects of triple talaq, when his younger sister was divorced by her husband. “He just said it was ‘Allah’s wish’. I was not convinced and had railed against this. Many people around me made fun of me. I realized much later that I needed to do something different to change people’s mindset,” he said.

In early 1970s, Sayedbhai came in contact with social reformer Hamid Dalwai in Pune. On March 22 the same year, they established the Muslim Satyashodak Mandal here. “I enrolled my sister in tailoring classes. She worked hard and raised her two sons, who went on to get government jobs. She made me realize how difficult it was for divorced women without support,” Sayedbhai said.

“We helped such women by extended financial support and legal assistance to ensure they got their due,” he said.

Over the decade, the mandal established branches in many cities. “With our network, we were able to help many women, who are now self-reliant. This gives me the ultimate satisfaction,” he said.

On January 10, Sayedbhai and his colleagues met PM Narendra Modi in New Delhi and submitted a memorandum on a uniform civil code.

“I hail from Hyderabad, but I am now a Punekar. This city has always supported my work. I dedicate my award to this city,” he said.

CHENNAI: Former Tamil Nadu chief secretary and Padma Bhushan T V Antony , 86, who died on Friday at a city hospital after a brief illness was a champion of family planning .

Antony, who joined the IAS in 1956, was a second-generation civil servant who drew inspiration from his father T V Varghese, an ICS officer, who retired as TN chief secretary in 1965. Years later, Antony had two stints as TN chief secretary, first in 1985-1986 and later for a brief while in 1991. About his removal from the CS post in 1986, Antony once told this correspondent, “People used to say that I was removed as CS because of some miscommunication. MGR, who was bedridden, wanted the TV antenna to be changed. But people around him thought he said ‘change T V Antony’. I was shifted.”

His stint as Thanjavur collector was a turning point in his life, Antony told M Smriti, a student and freelance journalist, in an interview in 2013. To understand the problems of farm labourers, he spent a night in a worker’s house. “The room measured hardly 100 sq ft in which they had to accommodate the father and mother, relatives and their five children. I was given a corner place in the room. At night, there was heavy downpour. The farmer requested me that their buffalo also needed to be brought inside the house. I shared my corner of the hut and slept with the buffalo,” Antony said in the interview.

During a casual conversation years ago, Antony told this correspondent that once his younger son demanded a younger brother to bully because he was getting bullied by his older brother. “I was flummoxed by the demand from the four-year-old kid. It was breakfast time. I asked him how many dosas he was getting for breakfast. He said three. I told him, see, you and your brother are getting three dosas each now. If you have one more brother, six dosas will have to be shared by three kids. I asked him whether he wanted three dosas or two dosas and a younger brother. Pat came the reply that he preferred three dosas,” said Antony.

His commitment and nation-wide campaign for family planning and two-child formula got him the moniker ‘Tubectomy Vasectomy’ Antony, which he accepted with grace. The reward for his decades of campaign for family planning came in 2004 when he was conferred Padma Bhushan.

Antony’s younger brother Thomas Varghese was general manager of Southern Railway. Antony is survived by his wife Molly Varghese and two sons. The funeral service will be held at St Louis Church Gandhi Nagar at 11 am on Monday. DMK president M K Stalin, in a message, said Antony fought for women’s rights.

COIMBATORE: A six-member gang was arrested on Friday night for extorting a car worth Rs 8 lakh, gold chain weighing five sovereigns and Rs 27,500 cash from a businessman by blackmailing him with a video of him spending intimate moments with a woman. Police have recovered all the valuables from the gang.

An investigation officer said the plan to trap K Vinodhkumar, 32, of Raja Street, was hatched by Sudha, 30, estranged wife of Manikandan from Ammapalayam near Tirupur and her accomplices. Vinodhkumar is a wholesale garment seller.

“He received a phone call from an unknown number on December 26, 2019 and the caller introduced herself as Prema. She soon befriended him. On December 29, she asked Vinodhkumar to meet her at a bakery at Kinathukadavu , which he did. The next day, she called him and requested him to meet her at Masaniamman temple at Anaimalai at 6pm on December 31,” the officer said.

Vinodhkumar met her at the temple and later took her to his farmhouse at Poovalaparuthi near Anaimalai. “Around 12.30am on January 1, a five-member gang entered inside the farmhouse and recorded the intimate moments of the couple by threatening Vinodhkumar. They snatched his gold chain and made him withdraw Rs27,500 from an ATM booth at Ambarampalayam. Later, they dropped him in Pollachi and made away with his car,” the officer said.

A few days later, the officer said, Vinodhkumar received a phone call from one of the gang members, demanding Rs 25 lakh. “He also threatened Vinodhkumar that they would circulate the obscene video on social media, if he failed to meet their demand.”

Following this, Vinodhkumar approached district superintendent of police Sujit Kumar, who formed a special team led by sub inspector Arun to nab the gang.

Preliminary inquiry revealed that the woman was the mastermind behind the crime, and it was she who arranged the gang to enter inside the farmhouse when she was with the businessman.

The team tracked them down and arrested all the six - Sudha and her accomplices M Senthilkumar alias Soda Senthil, 56; K Satheesh, 31; M Kamal, 50; V Prasanth, 24; and C Ajay, 38, all natives of Palakkad district – on Friday night.

The officer said Sudha was separated from her husband and has been living with her mother in Tirupur. She has two children. “She was operating the gang with the help of Senthilkumar. They were planning to extort money from various businessmen.” Senthilkumar, he said, was earlier sentenced to life for murdering his first wife’s lover.

All the six have been lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison under judicial custody.

Visakhapatnam: The state animal husbandry department is yet to put in place a mechanism to check the presence of chemical fertilisers and pesticides in paddy straw and its effect on cattle and the quality of milk they produce.

Paddy straw is utilised both as green fodder as well as dry fodder. Though considered a source of food for cattle around the year, especially milch cattle, the hay contains remains of pesticides and chemical fertilisers that are used in paddy production. The hay also contains oxalates that affect milk production.

A number of farmers in north-coastal Andhra depend on animal husbandry, and especially milch cattle as a source of daily cash flow and to augment income. Of late, the increasing dependence on readily-available paddy hay has affected milk production in the region.

“Earlier our animals were fed legume straw and would also be taken to common pastures for feeding. However, with the availability of paddy hay on the rise, there has been a shift. Of late we have noticed that animals which feed on green paddy grass and hay have a tendency to become weak. We were informed by experts in the animal husbandry department that this was because of calcium loss due to the presence of oxalates. Now, we are forced to give them calcium additives, while earlier we just fed them naturally and locally-available food,” said Ch Raju, a farmer from Narsipatnam division.

With only two forensic labs in AP and Telangana, one in Hyderabad and the other in Vijayawada, an in-depth study is yet to be carried out. “Usually most pesticides and chemical fertilisers do not have a long-lasting effect,” said B Ramakrishna, joint director of the animal husbandry department, Visakhapatnam.

CHENNAI: She fought many battles to keep her son, a chronic renal failure patient, alive. After surviving breast cancer herself, Vasundhara Raghavan helped her son manage his chronic kidney disease and undergo renal transplants twice. Today, she runs Kidney Warriors Foundation, an organization that helps people with kidney diseases gather information on diet and dialysis through face, besides offering them technical and sometimes financial assistance.

“My son had a problem of bed-wetting. When we took him to the doctor, he told us he will be fine in four or five years. When he wasn’t, I took him again. This time, doctors told us I should have brought him to them at least four years ago. I never recovered from the guilt that I could have prevented my son’s disease,” she said at the 45 minute-talk on ‘The Kidney Warriors - A New Outlook to the Kidney Disease Challenge’ organized by the TANKER Foundation. Behind her the message on the screen was: Kidney disease is not our choice, it just happened.

Two days after she cleared tests to donate a kidney to her then teenaged son, Raghavan was diagnosed with breast cancer, she told TOI. This was followed by surgery and cycles of chemotherapy and radiation that delayed her turning a donor by three years. She finally went back to the hospital as her son’s donor in 1999. The next six-and-a-years held multiple hospital visits for Aditya Raghavan, whose immune system was fighting the new organ . He had to return to dialysis when the new kidney gave up. In 2009, Aditya had his second transplant with his elder brother being the donor. It was a success and ended the bed-wetting.

Aditya completed his masters degree at IIT-Bombay and a PhD in Physics the US while battling the disease. “He now makes cheese. I have written nearly four books (on kidney ailments),” she said. Though based in Dubai, she is campaigning with the government to change organ laws in the country.

Vasundhara Raghavan was presented with an award by Tanker Foundation for her exemplary work in the field. Awards were also given to diabetologists Dr R M Anjana, Dr Prahalathan K K, and Dr C V Krishnaswami, nephrologists Dr M A Muthusethupathi and Dr Nanditha Choudhury.

Alkaline water is infused with minerals and is known to give better hydration and better detoxification.Past JourneyAfter studying Global Business Management in Macroeconomics from London University, Aakash Vaghela, founder and managing director, AV Organics, took over his family business in the real estate sector. “I came across the concept of alkaline water and its benefits in 2016 but didn’t find any Indian brand offering it. Dr Nobert Chirase later helped us develop the product. Then we took the big leap,” said Vaghela.AV Organics, which was incorporated in August 2018, invested $1 million in the setting up of the plant. The company’s total investment in launching the wellness product will be $2.5 million by the end of March 2020. The latest launch of the product in Gujarat was preceded by its launch in cities like Pune, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Delhi and Gurgaon, among others.Next StepsThe Vadodara-based startup had been recently conferred the ‘Pride of Gujarat’ Award by CM Vijay Rupani in the field of entrepreneurship. Going forward, the company plans to launch products in more Indian cities. “Our plant in Vadodara has an installed capacity of 40 million bottles a year and we plan to retail at least 25,000 cases (bottles) by the end of June 2020,” said Vaghela. AV Organics is also in the process of developing newer products in the wellness segment.ChallengesAlkaline water is black in colour and thus convincing customers and distribution is a major challenge. “Convincing distributors, retailers and customers to try out alkaline water that is black in colour and yet a wellness product, is a challenge. Currently we have 14 super-stockists and 40 distributors who supply our product but getting there has been a challenge,” said Vaghela. “Through constant product innovation and ensuring a better product offering, we are trying to address this challenge,” he further added.Secret to SuccessAccording to Vaghela, finding the right team that understands the product and strives to innovate is something that has always worked. “The uniqueness of the product is what has always worked for us but setting up a good team has steered our journey to success,” he said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/boosting-health-with-black-alkaline-water/articleshow/73620831.cms

Representative image

MADURAI: The fine limit for acts of crime committed under the Pocso Act is not fixed, and the perpetrator could be asked to part with half his wealth to the victim, if the trial is conducted in a proper manner and conviction is awarded, justice T Raja, judge of the Madras high court has said.

Speaking at the inauguration of the special court for exclusive trial of cases under Pocso Act, 2012, in Madurai on Saturday, justice Raja said that advocates should be aware of the facts of the case they are pursuing. Pocso is an Act with severe conditions and the minimum punishment is 20 years while the maximum is death sentence for a crime involving aggravated sexual penetration and assault.

The special court was inaugurated by justice N Nisha Banu , who said that it would help obtain speedy justice for the victims. Many children are violated in today’s society and parents should remember that it is difficult to repair a broken child, and give them extra care accordingly, she said.

Offences against children and women is a social problem, and needs to be addressed with a social concern. Creating awareness among the children is one way in which it could be tackled, said commissioner of police, Madurai, S Davidson Devasirvatham.

He said that 409 Pocso cases have been booked in Madurai so far posing a big challenge to the police. There has been an increase in these cases in recent times. While 33 were registered in 2017, it was 53 in 2018 and 80 in 2019, he said. Police should pursue love affair cases involving minors , which often do not witness conviction rates as the parents’ tend to withdraw the cases. Police should involve in quality investigation and the investigation officer should not compromise on the justice being obtained for a victim, he said. The new court would ensure speedy trial, which would instil confidence among victims of such cases, Devasirvatham said.

IG South Zone, K P Shanmugarajeswaran, said that 7-8 out of 10 cases registered under the Pocso Act were motivated by elders against minors, which are mutually settled later. This delayed the investigation of real cases of violations against children. Awareness is a must at all levels which was being done right from the school level, he added.

Madurai collector Dr T G Vinay said the rise in offences against children was a cause for concern, and that boys in the family should also be educated and sensitized on this issue. Advocate M Theivakani and advocate S Mohankumar stressed on the importance of ensuring moral education in all schools, as the number of minors booked under the Pocso Act for committing crimes, was a matter of concern.

COIMBATORE: Overwhelmed by the response received to the Coimbatore-Rameswaram special train that was introduced for the Pongal season, the Salem division of Southern Railway is planning to run the train on a trial basis and make it permanent eventually. The division is now working out on the logistics and timings for the same.

It is to be noted that a night train to Rameswaram from the city via Pollachi and Madurai was also one of the requests that MLA and deputy speaker Pollachi V Jayaraman had made to the general manager of Southern Railway on Thursday. He had also pitched for a day train or an intercity express between Coimbatore and Madurai, as that would help businessmen and traders who frequently travel between the two cities.

These two services have been long-pending demands from the residents of Pollachi-Udumalpet belt. Pointing out that the Salem division used to run trains to these two destinations earlier, Coimbatore MP P R Natarajan said the services were stopped when the gauge conversion work began. “Now, it’s only a matter of reintroducing them.”

The Salem division said the requests for the trains were sent to the Southern Railway headquarters, which has forwarded them to the railway board. “We have also submitted all our logistical workings to show the trains’ feasibility. We are constantly trying to improve the logistics to get these trains introduced. We have to keep introducing new trains and it has been awhile since we introduced a new train,” said Subba Rao, divisional railway manager.

MLA Sunil Tingre (centre) with civic officials at the proposed DP Road site near Dhanori Jakat Naka.

PUNE: The construction of the much-awaited DP road from Dhanori Jakat Naka to DY Patil College is finally on track with the Pune Municipal Corporation issuing a tender of Rs 6 crore for the project.

This development plan (DP) road will run parallel to Porwal Road and benefit the residents of Lohegaon and Dhanori, who had been pushing for the project for years now.

Lohegaon resident Meenakshi Kadam said residents were forced to battle daily traffic issues and the new road would, hopefully, put an end to their plight. “We appreciate the efforts taken by the local leaders for taking up our demands seriously,” she said.

An active volunteer of ‘Green Run marathon’ held recently for DP road development, Prashant Lage, said, “This area was neglected for years. But, now there is some hope. We have also suggested the local MLA to take up the development of other internal roads in the area.”

The residents said once the DP road was constructed, it would help reduce traffic volume on Porwal Road. “The construction of the DP road will bring much-needed relief to the residents of Dhanori and Lohegaon areas,” Sandeep Lokhande, vice-president of the Lohegaon Residents’ Welfare Association (LRWA), said.

When contacted, MLA Sunil Tingre told TOI, “The road will be of 60-metre wide and about 2.1km long. A majority of the land for the project was acquired between 2012 and 2015, following which about 1km of the road was developed. However, the construction was stopped over land acquisition issues thereafter. The tender for the project was floated on January 17.”

A civic official said a section of the road, about 200 metres, was still facing some issue, for which Section 205 (power to make public road by compulsory acquisition of private land) of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, would be applied.

Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of the civic road department, said, “The residents of Dhanori and Lohegaon, besides the members of LRWA, have been constantly following up for construction of this road. Considering their demands, the tender was floated and once construction begins, it will be ready within six months.”

MADURAI: The one-member retired justice Aruna Jagadeesan commission that is probing the anti-Sterlite protest, riots and police firing that claimed 13 lives on May 22 and 23, 2018, has cited poor cooperation from the government departments and Tuticorin district administration.

Counsel for the commission, Vadivel Murugan told this to reporters in Tuticorin on Saturday on completion of the 18th sitting of the inquiry. “We have asked officials concerned for the places where the 108 ambulances and fire tenders were stationed during the procession on May 22 (2018) but we have not got it so far,” he said. Stating that they have sent reminders to those officials, he added that they have also asked for footage recorded in the CCTV cameras at three places in the Tuticorin collectorate, but are yet to receive it. “We have asked footage for one week before the incident took place,” he said and added that it would be instrumental for continuance of the probe.

Murugan said that employees of Sterlite staying in the places affected during the protest, forensic personnel who submitted the ballistic report, doctors who conducted the autopsy and those who treated the injured will be inquired in the next sitting, which is likely to be held in the third week of February. Apart from police officers who have submitted affidavits to the commission, officers in the rank of DIG, SP, DSP and inspector and police personnel who were present during the turn of events are being identified with the available video footage. The commission on identifying the personnel is summoning them through the police department.

Vadivel said the commission has also written to the Tuticorin district administration to give relevant government jobs based on the education qualification of the kin of those killed in the incident. Stating that financial relief has also been given to most victims, they have also sought speedy disposal of compensation to the few victims who were left out.

Shaken, Ramesh approached Vijayawada police and requested them to come to his rescue. The cybercrime wing launched an investigation into the issue. It was revealed during the course of investigation that Ramesh shared his Aadhar card, PAN card and bank account details with an unidentified person through Whatsapp. The person claimed to be a representative of his bank and said Ramesh’s debit card was deactivated because it was not linked with his Aadhaar card.

He asked Ramesh to send his debit card number and bank account details along with a photograph of both the PAN and Aadhaar card placing them on a white paper with his signature. After sending the details, his account was debited by Rs 1,750. When Ramesh enquired about the deduction of money, the person replied that the sum would be deposited in two days. Ramesh did not file a complaint as the amount he lost was small and was not willing to go to police.

Cybercrime inspector K Shivaji said the fraudsters first tried to loot Ramesh’s account, but as he was a poor person and did not have much in his account, they created a PayTm account with his credentials. Using the PayTm account, the fraudsters cheated other people, following which Gurugram Police registered a case and came all the way to Vijayawada looking for Ramesh. Vijayawada Police cleared Ramesh’s name .

CHENNAI: The Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry has warned more than 1,000 lawyers who have enrolled as advocates by producing forged college attendance certificates of severe action unless they surrendered their enrolment certificates immediately.

The issue came to light when Vipin – a retired employee of Southern Railways — approached the council for enrolment. He claimed that he had successfully completed law degree from Smt Basava Rama Tarakam Memorial Law College, Cuddapah, Andhra Pradesh in 2015-18. As per the rules set by the Madras high court , candidates who have secured law degrees from states other than TN must produce attendance certificates from the college. Vipin had produced an attendance certificate , which on verification by the council, was found to be forged and obtained in connivance with the college’s principal Himavantha Kumar. Kumar was arrested subsequently. A preliminary inquiry revealed that more than 1,000 advocates enrolled with the council had obtained such forged certificates from the college.

Briefing reporters, the council’s chairperson P S Amalraj said, “Such people must surrender their enrolment certificates immediately. If not, criminal action will be initiated besides ensuring that pension and other benefits they enjoy are stopped.” Amalraj said a committee is verifying certificates produced by candidates with other state law degrees.

While Jagan himself promised several of them a seat in the council during his poll campaign, a few others loyal to the party supremo for the past decade joined the race after the polls.

The hopes of all such leaders have now been dashed after the chief minister’s threat to abolish the council after failing to pass the capital decentralisation and CRDA repeal bills in the council. The ruling party leaders have now come to the conclusion that abolishing the council is necessary to check opposition TDP.

Many of them feel the party will definitely recognise their services and reward them in the future.

Sources said back room operators of the party were working with smart strategies to handle the situation for the past several months as they were aware of the council’s fate.

The strategists have reportedly devised plans to set up regional development boards to serve multiple purposes including accommodating their party men with protocol status. While the abolishment of the council would leave the TDP without any political say or protocol, the new boards would empower YSRC functionaries to take the lead in implementation of welfare and developmental programmes.

Though the proposed regional boards will have at least four nominated members, the government is likely to increase the berths to 10 after the council is abolished. In such a scenario, at least 40 YSRC leaders will get a place in the boards, which is equivalent to the rank of MLA. Interestingly, YSRC’s strength might not cross 25-30 even if the council exists and it will take at least three years to achieve majority numbers. Getting 40 berths in the regional boards by losing 30 berths in the council will get rid of the TDP, and also accommodate council hopefuls from YSRC.

Police heighten vigil in the area

VADODARA/ ANAND: A special investigation team (SIT) has been formed to probe the death of the elderly man who died in firing in communal riots that had broke out in the sensitive Akbarpura area of Khambhat town of Anand district on Friday.

Even as the family of the deceased man refused to accept the body till Saturday evening, a SIT was formed to probe whether 65-year-old Vinod Chavda had died due to private firing or government firing.

“Considering the sensitive nature of the death, we have formed the SIT comprising police inspector of Vallabh Vidyanagar and police sub inspectors of Khambolaj and Virsad,” said Anand district superintendent of police Makrand Chauhan.

Demanding that the cops should register a complaint against police inspector of Khambhat in connection to Chavda’s death, family members of the deceased had refused to take possession of the dead body till late Saturday evening.

Chavda was sitting inside an auto rickshaw which he had boarded from Tran Batti area to reach Lal Darwaja area of the town when a bullet hit him resulting in his death.

While the cops have maintained that private firing could have resulted in Chavda’s death, family members allege that he died due to police firing.

Meanwhile, over 50 accused were arrested by the police in connection to the riots in the town that had left around 15 cops injured. Mobs from both the communities had resorted to heavy stone pelting at each other while nearly ten houses and shops were set ablaze and several vehicles vandalized.

Police had fired six rounds in the air and lobbed 25 tear gas shells to quell the mob but the rioters had continued to pelt stones even in the presence of cops.

Markets in and around Akbarpura area of the town remained closed on Saturday as well amidst heavy bandobast that was deployed since Friday to prevent escalation of violence. A complaint has been registered against a mob of 150 persons in connection to the riots.

The leopard trapped at Yegaon village on Friday.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A leopard was trapped in a cage at Yedgaon village on Friday.

SR Katte, RFO, Khodad, confirmed that a leopard has been trapped at Yedgaon village. Naresh Nerkar, sarpanch, Yedgaon village, said, “Leopards were being sighted at Yedgaon village for the past two-three months. A person riding a two-wheeler was attacked by a leopard recently, but no one was injured in the incident. We contacted the forest department officials and they installed a cage two months ago. The cage was shifted after a week to a new location. The leopard was found in the cage on Friday morning.”

He said the leopard was sent to the leopard rescue centre at Manikdoh. “We suspect that there is at least one more leopard roaming around the surrounding areas. So, we have demanded that a cage be installed in the village,” he said.

The forest department installed a cage at Katewadi village in Baramati taluka on Friday following a few incidents of leopard attacks this week.

“We installed a cage at Katewadi on Friday. Leopards have been sighted at Katewadi and Kanhere gram panchayat limits. We have also found pugmarks and are conducting night patrolling in the villages and carrying out public awareness campaigns,” said Rahul Kale, range forest officer (RFO), Indapur, who also holds the additional charge of Baramati. He said the forest department suspects the presence of two leopards in these villages.

A sheep was injured on Monday last in a leopard attack in Katewadi, while a goat was killed and a sheep injured on Thursday in Kanhere village. The incidents created fear among villagers in Kanhere and Katewadi.

Leopards are mostly found in the sugar cane fields of Junnar, Ambegaon and Shirur talukas in the district. “Leopards have been spotted in Daund taluka in the past two years, but not in Baramati taluka. So, we feel that leopards from Daund taluka may have strayed here,” said Kale.

On January 20, a 28-year-old youth was injured in a leopard attack at village Pimpalgaon Siddhnath, 3km ahead of Junnar, following which a cage was installed in the area by the forest department.

158,['26/01/2020'],IMD forecast rules out El Nino possibility till Sept,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Pune: The possibility of an El Nino, a vital indicator of how monsoon may fare during a year, can be ruled out till September this year.

This was indicated in the latest El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) Bulletin of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

The update said warm ENSO-neutral conditions were prevailing over equatorial Pacific Ocean currently, but forecasts indicate cooling of sea surface temperatures in the coming season with ENSO-neutral conditions likely to continue for the entire forecast period.

ENSO-neutral conditions mean when there is neither an El Nino nor La Nina, the two factors impacting the Indian monsoon.

Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general of meteorology at IMD said, “It is too early to comment on how the monsoon may fare in the absence of an El Nino event as it is one of the factors governing the southwest monsoon, but not the only one.”

The forecast said there was over 65-75% probability of neutral conditions during the monsoon season (June-September 2020).

IMD officials said with the probability of neutral El Nino conditions from May this year, India's summer temperatures in 2020 could be normal or slightly above normal, as they may only be governed by the existing global warming trend and not an El Nino event. Like monsoon, El Nino is also said to impact country's temperatures, leading to higher than normal temperatures.

A senior IMD official told TOI that though ENSO neutral conditions prevailing, sea surface temperatures in equatorial Pacific Ocean were still on the warmer side. “As of now, there is less chance of an El Nino event till September, but we would need to wait and watch for any changes in the situation. Though slightly warmer than normal sea surface temperatures over the equatorial Pacific could prevail at that time, they are unlikely to cross the El Nino threshold,” the official said.

When asked about the Indian Ocean Dipole, which helps monsoon when in a positive phase, the official said a clear picture on this would emerge only in July.

On the likely temperatures during the next few months, the official said, “Right now, we are seeing clouding due to westerly activity and humidity in parts of the country, while maximum temperatures seem to be on the lower side in north India. As of now, we do not expect any immediate changes in temperatures. Since El Nino conditions are unlikely to prevail during the summer, whatever slight rise we may see in the average temperatures during this year’s summer season may only be due to the ongoing climate change situation or global warming.”

Graphic:

El Nino and La Nina are Spanish terms meaning ‘little boy’ and ‘little girl’, respectively

El Nino is a phenomenon of anomalous warming of the central and east equatorial Pacific Ocean with a quasi periodicity of 2-7 years, while La Nina is just the opposite phase of El Nino and is associated with anomalous cooling over the equatorial Pacific Ocean

El Nino events show a propensity to be associated with a weaker than normal summer monsoon rainfall over India

La Niña events show a propensity to be associated with a greater than normal rainfall

HYDERABAD: Absence of a speech by AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi at the party’s protest meeting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), NRC and NPR at Khilawat Ground in Old City on Saturday did not go unnoticed. The meet had to be ended quickly due to time restrictions imposed by the Telangana High Court.

Residents from Old City thronged the venue holding National Flags and anti-CAA placards. According to police, around 5,000 people attended the event.

This is the first time Asaduddin did not speak at an AIMIM protest led by him. However, he did take a jibe at the halwa ceremony organised by the finance ministry ahead of the budget session as well as the poha remark by Kailash Vijayvargiya.

“We don’t have much time as we have to respect the high court’s orders. If the police allows, we will form a human chain on January 30. So today, you can relax and return home and eat halwa or poha,” Owaisi said.

Poets, singers, JNU students, religious scholars and even a few protesters from Shaheen Bhag attended the meeting and also addressed the gathering.

The party had initially planned to hoist the National Flag at Charminar at midnight, but it was cancelled after a petition was filed in the HC following which the organisers were ordered to change the venue and timing. “We will obey the court’s decision. The high court is supreme, but not infallible,” Owaisi had said in a video, urging people to participate in the Saturday meeting.

Meanwhile, Urdu poet Rahat Indori received applause for his poem which emphasised on secularism.

CHENNAI: The CB-CID police probing the ‘vanishing ink ’ scam related to the TNPSC Group-IV recruitment examinations on Saturday arrested four more people, three of whom figured in the list of top 100 candidates . A city court later remanded them in judicial custody.

Police identified the arrested as T Venkataramanan, 38, of Avadi; M Thiruvelmurugan, 31, of Ramanathapuram; R Rajasekar, 26, of Panruti in Cuddalore district, and M Kalesha, 29, of Gowripet near Ramanathapuram. Police said Venkataramanan acted as a mediator, collected funds and helped the three arrested and several others clear the exam . Thiruvelmurugan, R Rajasekar, and M Kalesha figured among the top 100 selected candidates.

The CB-CID police teams are conducting inquiries with a few more suspects picked up from Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram and other parts of the state. Police sources told TOI that more arrests were likely.

Discrepancies in the top 100 candidates list lead to the TNPSC sniffing out the vanishing ink scam, wherein answerscripts of 52 candidates were found to be manipulated. Touts had given candidates pens with special ink that vanished in a few hours. The OMR answerscripts were later filled with the correct answer in collusion with some exam officials, resulting in 39 of the cheating candidates ending up among top 100.

On Saturday, special police teams of the CB-CID units conducted checks in five districts to zero in on brokers and mediators. A police officer privy to the probe said, “There are around 20 others, including candidates and mediators , in the custody of the CB-CID for inquiry.”

Busting of the racket led to several who appeared for exams to recruit sub-inspectors and Grade-II police constables conducted by the Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board (TNUSRB) crying foul on social media about malpractice in these exams as well. TNUSRB, however, clarified that there was no foul play in its exams.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is planning to float a new tender to hire a private agency that will use its own infrastructure to carry out the animal birth control (ABC) programme.

The civic body is responsible for carrying out animal birth control programmes and there are guidelines for dog catching, sterilisation, pre- and post-operative procedures and rabies eradication.

Currently, the AMC has engaged the services of Ranchi based HOPE & Animal Trust to implement the programme in the city. According to the AMC, over the past six months, HOPE & Animal Trust has carried out 3,209 sterilisations. According to the contract, the agency isto get Rs 950 for each sterilisation.

However, the problem of stray dogs continues. On January 12, a two-and-a half year old girl was bitten by a stray dog in Padegaon. Last year, a 10 year old boy, a resident of Barudgar Nullah had succumbed to the injuries he got from an attack by a pack of dogs. Residential and commercial areas in Buddi Lane, City Chowk, Roshan Gate, Central Naka, Cidco N-3, N-5, N-9, N-11, Railway Station, Osmanpura and Mukundwadi complain of stray dogs posing a threat.

Bhagwat Naikwade, chief animal husbandry officer of the AMC, said the dog sterilisation programme would require improvement in the infrastructure of the AMC’s dog clinic at Central Naka. “Demolishing the existing operation theatre, OPD rooms and constructing new rooms, dog kennels for the pre- and post-operative care of dogs are required. A proposal was sent for financial approval last year.”

Meanwhile, on Friday, mayor Nandkumar Ghodele said the AMC has given ultimatum to the agency for not performing up to the mark.

“In order to the address the problem of the infrastructure, we will issue tenders to invite agencies to use their own infrastructure and carry out the animal birth control programme,” Ghodele said.

The mayor added that the AMC will spend more money to hire such an agency.

He said touts shouldn’t be allowed to be “intruded” into TNPSC. The MDMK general secretary was in the city to attend the party meeting.

Vaiko lamented that, agriculture will be eradicated from delta districts if hydro carbon projects are implemented in southern Tamil Nadu.

“The Central government should not bring those projects in Tamil Nadu,” he said. He also warned that, Tamil Nadu will turn barren if those projects started here.

Citing Mekedatu dam project, Vaiko said that, the Mettur dam, the lifeline of Tamil Nadu, will not get water if that project commences across river Cauvery in Karnataka . The entire state will starve for potable water, he warned, adding that, the state government should raise its voice against these projects.

As many as 20 chemical companies have received a green signal for their projects in Gujarat

AHMEDABAD: If environment clearances (EC) granted to companies for their projects are anything to go by, Gujarat will witness a flurry of fresh investments in the chemicals sector, especially agrochemicals and their intermediates.

As many as 20 chemical companies have received a green signal from Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) for their projects in Gujarat over the past three months alone. The estimated cost of these projects is upwards of Rs 3,000 crore.

Companies to have received a go-ahead for their projects include names like Bharat Rasayan Ltd, Cheminova India Ltd, Tagros Chemical India, Neogen Chemicals Ltd, Meghmani Organics Ltd and Insecticides India Ltd to name a few.

Denmark’s Cheminova was granted EC early this month for expanding its pesticides and pesticide specific intermediate manufacturing capacity at its plant located in Panoli, Ankleshwar . According to MoEFCC notification, the cost of project is around Rs 790 crore. Neogen Chemicals Ltd’s Rs 150 crore project for setting up fine chemicals and agro intermediates unit at Vagra in Bharuch also got the go-ahead.

Bharat Rasayan Limited (BRL), the flagship company of agrochemicals major Bharat group, plans to set up a new manufacturing facility for agrochemicals and their intermediates at Sayakha GIDC industrial estate at Vagra in Bharuch district . The project cost is Rs 310 crore.

The expansion and new projects receiving clearances in recent months are for agrochemicals, pesticides, dyes and intermediates and other chemicals. Majority of fresh investment is for expanding existing capacity of pesticides and adding new pesticide products.

“Agrochemicals is one business where there is a lot of supply coming from China to the rest of the world. In the last year or so, more and more European and American companies have begun looking towards India, for active ingredients which go into making insecticides, weedicides, herbicides. The world is now looking a little more on India than depending on China alone,” said Deepak Mehta, chairman, National Chemicals Committee, FICCI.

Industry players opine that the exports of pesticides from India has seen a strong growth over the last few years. Domestic demand too is growing. The gap between demand and availability of agrochemical, pesticide, insecticide, intermediate and formulation is likely to increase over the years. This calls for such projects which can help in bridging the gap.

“Apart from domestic market, there is a sizeable demand for agrochemicals in the international market, which is prompting companies to diversify into this sector,” added Mehta.

“Several companies are ramping up manufacturing capacities for basic chemicals such as sulphuric acid and caustic alkalies. There is a good demand for such products in both domestic and international market,” Shailesh Patwari, past president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI).

Trichy: Nearly six months after officials of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC, Trichy) agreed to halt mofussil buses at the Vannankovil bus stop close to the Srirangam revenue division office (RDO), passengers boarding buses towards Manapparai say that the crew have been refusing to stop the buses there. Due to this, they are forced to disembark at stoppages either before or after Vannankovil.

Vannankovil is situated on the Trichy - Manapparai stretch of the Trichy-Dindigul national highway and connects four major village panchayats including Navalurkottapattu. As the revenue office is situated there, villagers from various parts of Srirangam visit Vannankovil. Following complaints of TNSTC mofussil buses proceeding towards Manapparai skipping the stoppage, a special grievance meet was held at the Srirangam RDO in August 2019.

During the meeting, TNSTC officials agreed to halt the buses at Vannankovil. However, villagers often end up quarrelling with the bus crew as the latter refuse to halt the buses.

“We pointed out the circular issued by the TNSTC GM to halt mofussil buses at Vannankovil, but the bus crew say they are not aware of such instructions. With poor frequency of city buses, we rely on mofussil buses to reach the city,” T Lakshmanan, a resident of Vannankovil told TOI.

While the mofussil buses heading to Manapparai are halting at Dheeran Nagar and Ramji Nagar bus stops located before Vannankovil, villagers questioned the partiality of TNSTC fleet in skipping Vannankovil despite having an RDO office.

“Only the normal fare mofussil buses halt at the Vannankovil stoppage, mofussil (express) fleets do not,” a source in TNSTC said.

Vannankovil residents said that normal fare mofussil buses are very limited in frequency and have sought all services heading to Manapparai except non-stop and point-to-point buses to halt at Vannankovil.

Pune: A woman security guard posted at the mayor’s bungalow on Ghole Road was killed on Saturday afternoon after a speeding car hit her near the Tukaram Paduka Chowk while she was crossing the Fergusson College Road.

The woman, Bharati Baba Mandalik (25), flung in the air after the car hit her around 12.30pm. She then brushed against a Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus and fell on the road. She succumbed to head injuries

Senior police inspector Balasaheb Kopnar of the Shivajinagar police said, “Mandalik was a resident of Pandavnagar, off Senapati Bapat Road. We have booked the car driver for rash and negligent driving, and for causing her death due to negligence.”

Kiran Phadke, an eyewitness to the accident, told TOI, “Just after I parked my autorickshaw at the stand near the Tukaram Paduka temple on the road, the signal turned red. The woman started crossing the road after all the vehicles heading towards the Agriculture College Chowk stopped. She was going towards the Ghole Road from the Fergusson College side.”

He said, “The car that hit the woman had stopped beside the MSRTC bus. The woman had reached the middle of the road when the signal turned green. The car driver accelerated immediately, and his vehicle hit the woman. She brushed against the ST bus and fell down on the road.”

Senior inspector Kopnar said the Mandalik’s head had hit against the road after she fell. Phadke and other autorickshaw drivers had rushed Mandalik to a nearby hospital. “She died of head injuries,” the senior inspector said.

Kopnar said, “We have checked the footage of the CCTV cameras at the chowk. It clearly shows that the car gained speed and hit the pedestrian woman first. The woman then brushed against the bus. We did not find any fault on the part of the MSRTC bus driver in the case.”

He said, “The woman had stepped on the tar when the signal was red. She had walked only a few steps when the signal turned green. The car driver accelerated and hit the woman. It is prima facie assumed that the driver did not see the woman while accelerating.”

Mandalik’s relatives said she was the only earning member in the family of five. She is survived by a seven-year-old son and elderly parents.

“The woman had secured the job in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) after struggling a lot,” one of her relatives said.

Dehradun: Two days after CBI arrested an Assistant Garrison Engineer and a Junior Engineer from the Dehradun Garrison Engineer office for accepting a Rs 40,000 bribe from a Delhi-based contractor for clearing his payment of over Rs 20 lakh, two more senior officials have come under lens.

The central investigation agency is now probing the involvement of the two senior engineers in the case.

Sources told TOI that the CBI team recovered Rs 60,000 during raids conducted at the offices and residences of the two erring officials—KK Singhal and Jahangir Ahmed.

“The two engineers worked with Research and Development division which is given sensitive construction work in all Army installations. The investigation has revealed that the two engineers were asking for bribe on behalf of two seniors posted in the same station,” said a senior CBI official.

Notably, the Garrison Engineer office comes under the Military Engineering Services (MES) division of the Army which has the mandate of carrying out construction work across the country.

CBI officials say that the interrogation of the two officials revealed the role of other officials. The two senior officials are expected to join the investigation this week to explain their position.

“Bribery case on engineers, working for a vital installation wing, is a very serious matter and the CBI would be seeking help of Military Engineer Services in Delhi as well,” said another CBI official involved in the investigation.

Aurangabad: A park that has been developed and beautified under the Cidco flyover, also known as Veer Savarkar flyover, was inaugurated on Saturday morning.

The 17,000 sqft under the flyover was developed as part of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s ‘Let’s Make City Beautiful’ scheme.

In the first phase, Giants Group of Aurangabad Pride, under president Sanjay Jaiswal, had taken up the beautification of the space. As part of its CSR initiative, the Giants Group has built a 6.5ft wide and 700ft long walking track, 6ft wide and 300ft long cycling track, two garden zones with benches over 1,600 sqft area, with seating arrangement for 128 people, and 1,600 sqft area for children to play, which includes a see-saw and swings.

There are more than 200 trees and plants in the park and the area is protected with 6ft high fence on all four sides. A 2,000 litre water tank is provided for watering and washing needs. The columns inside the area have information about famous places in Aurangabad city. A separate parking zone for cycles has been arranged.

In phase II, the Giants Group will be developing another 25,000 sqft which will include a cricket turf, skating track, mural garden, 3D garden and landscape garden, Jaiswal said.

The park was dedicated to the public by former Aurangabad MP Chandrakant Khaire, in the presence of MLA Atul Save, mayor Nandkumar Ghodele and deputy mayor Rajendra Janjal.

The AMC was unable to maintain the gardens, open spaces, places under flyovers, crematoriums, graveyards and traffic islands in the city due to lack of staff and funds.

Storytelling through dance at the Hyderabad Literary Festival on Saturday

HYDERABAD: Providing a rich platform of authors, film directors, poets, painters, and storytellers, the tenth edition of the three-day Hyderabad Literary Festival which began on Friday at Vidyarnanya High School in the city, observed sessions on creativity in the modern age.

The second day of the literary fest saw a high number of environmentally conscious citizens deliberating on increasing urban spaces and saving trees. “We can save a lot of trees by being creative in city planning, but that requires a strong political will and human resources to get the work done,” Radhika Bhogal, an academician and environment activist from Chandanagar.

Talking about rekindling the lost green spaces in India, Bahar Dutt , author of ‘Rewilding: India’s Experiments in Saving Nature’ said, “Rewilding involves protecting green areas through corridors and bringing back lost species. It is an opportunity to set things right.”

“It can play an important role in revitalising our forests, rivers, and wetlands. It is important that we do rewilding to undo the damage we have inflicted on the natural world,” she added.

Young minds from across the country discussed democracy and religion and voiced their opinions on the current state of the country.

“We need to take cognizance of our religion before fighting the views of extremists. We cannot look at India without understanding the nuances of religion,” said Ashutosh, former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) politician while addressing the session called, ‘Righting the Nation.’ The discussions continued with a large number of school and college students peppering the authors with questions, in the ‘Meet the Author’ area.

Throughout the day, there were workshops, storytelling sessions and photography exhibitions at various locations in the school . A significant number of people attended the creative fiction and novel writing workshop by Australian authors Kim Wilkins and Lisa Heidke.

Pune: The water stock of Temghar dam dipped to 0.31 TMC (8.3%) on Saturday, giving the state irrigation department an opportunity to expedite its pending repair works.

The irrigation department has started the grouting work on the outer side of the dam’s wall. A similar work in the upstream area at the bottom and the inner side of the wall will begin in March, after the water-level drops further. The filling of cement in critical portions near the spillway will be done in April. The entire grouting work is expected to get over by June.

The stock of Temghar, an important water source for the city, was 100% at the end of monsoon. The storage was brought down on priority in the past three months. The dam’s water was released in the Khadakwasla dam.

An official from the state irrigation department said a plan had been chalked out to complete the work before monsoon. “Though we have been able to arrest 90% of the seepages as of now, the cementing work in the critical portions is still pending. We are targeting to fix these points near the spillway at the earliest. We have also constructed a bridge on the wall to place the machinery on the top of the spillway,” the official said.

A technical advisory committee of experts appointed by the state government has started inspecting the dam to propose long-term measures. The geophysical tests of the dam are being conducted for a detailed technical analysis of its status. The inspections will throw light on the density of structures, design and any improvements if required. The inspection will continue for another month.

The state government had allotted Rs105 crore for repairing the dam. The expenses are likely to climb up to Rs130 crore, considering inflation and other factors.

The irrigation department said it had tabled a proposal before the state government to allot Rs100 crore for the long-term measures that the experts’ committee would recommend.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad city police have issued a directive to schools making it mandatory for them to deploy a women attendant in all school buses and vans.

The communication was issued in the aftermath of the recent incident of a school van driver — and two of his accomplices — molesting a nine-year-old child with learning disability.

An offence in this regard was registered with the Satara area police station after the video of the incident (recorded by one of the suspects) went viral.

Aurangabad commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad said, “The incident brought to our notice the fact that there are schools that are not following the child safety guidelines that are mandatory for every school management.”

The officer, while issuing the directive, maintained that the police may soon carry out surprise inspections of school buses.

“Those found flouting the norms will face stringent action,” said Prasad.

The police said that they expect the school managements to stringently following the Maharashtra Motor Vehicles (Regulations for School Buses), Rules 2011.

As per the guidelines, the transport contractor shall employ woman attendants for girls and co-educational schools and male attendants/cleaners for boys schools. A distinct uniform shall be prescribed for the driver, the lady attendant and the male attendant/cleaner for identification. Identity cards must be issued by the operator and they should be displayed by all on-duty staff.

In addition, the transporter must inform the school about any changes in the bus service schedule in the case of bandh/traffic jams/accidents/breakdowns/road blockages immediately. Also, no eatables or drinks shall be offered to the children in buses by the staff unless provided by the school.

City police have asked school authorities to ensure that the character verification of their staffers, especially bus drivers, cleaners and attendants is done before they are hired.

PUNE: Traffic and road safety activists on Saturday stressed that the Pune Municipal Corporation and the city traffic police should treat the accident on Fergusson College Road as a wake-up call.

The convener of PedestriansFIRST , Prashant Inamdar, said, “The authorities have made smart footpaths, but have been unable to properly design pedestrian crossings. The PMC (Pune Municipal Corporation) is working on aesthetic elements but not on safety elements like Zebra Crossings on arterial roads. Speeding on FC Road and JM Road, and no safe crossing are a potent combination for accidents.”

The director of Save Pune Traffic Movement, Harshad Abhyankar, said two to three generations in the city had grown without proper pedestrian infrastructure and signals. “People have not seen functional pedestrian signals. If they are there, the signals are not programmed properly. Indiscipline is also ingrained in people. Only stringent enforcement, coupled with hefty fines, can provide a proper outcome,” he said.

Abhyankar was hopeful that the new municipal commissioner would set aside funds for pedestrian signals in the upcoming budget.

Aurangabad: Aurangabad Tourism Development Foundation (ATDF) has said that talks were on with operators for flights to Dubai, Singapore, Bangkok and Colombo.

The announcement was made at an event held in city to mark the National Tourism Day on January 25.

Over 11 months, flight operations at Aurangabad Airport have increased from six to 30. Much of this increase has been credited to the efforts of hotelier Sunit Kothari, ATDF president Jaswant Singh, president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO) Pranob Sarkar, IATO vice-president Rajeev Mehra, and Aurangabad airport director D G Salve.

There was a widespread impact on travel to the region following the grounding of Jet Airways flights in March last year. Subsequently, the team was responsible for continued follow-ups with airlines and the ministry of civil aviation. Currently, Aurangabad Airport hosts Air India, Trujet, Indigo and Spicejet flights. It is linked to Delhi, Mumbai, Udaipur, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Bengaluru.

On Saturday, the team was felicitated.

AAI Aurangabad director DG Salve said a proposal has been made for an immigration counter at the airport. “We are following up with the home ministry. This would make way for international flights from Aurangabad,” he said. Kothari said talks are on with airline operators to secure flights to Dubai, Bangkok, Colombo and Singapore.

French investors to visit city

Next month, a delegation of 150 investors from France will be visiting Aurangabad, ATDF president Jaswant Singh said. They will be visiting the Auric city under the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, he said.

188,['26/01/2020'],NHAI told to get rid of traffic island at Dwarka junction,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Nashik: District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal on Saturday instructed senior officials of the National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) in Nashik to do away with the traffic island at the Dwarka junction and set up a signal to get rid of the everyday traffic chaos.

Bhujbal held a meeting with NHAI officials and took stock of various problems pertaining to the Mumbai-Agra highway passing through the city.

Despite various measures taken in the past, the problem of traffic congestion at the Dwarka junction continues. The traffic island sitting in centre of the junction has been reduced on several occasions in the past, but has failed to ease the everyday traffic snarls in the area.

Bhujbal said that the Haji Ali junction in Mumbai faced similar problem due to the traffic island at the centre of the junction. Once the island was removed and a signal was set up, there was no problem of traffic congestion at that junction. On the same lines, at Dwarka, too, the traffic island should be removed and replaced with a signal.

Meanwhile, he also instructed the NHAI officials to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) of the proposed flyover between Sarda Circle to Nashik Road and present it to the government for perusal.

Recently, the NHAI has shot of a letter to the state public works department (PWD NH Division) to prepare the DPR of the proposed flyover as it was not in the position to construct it due to financial constraints.

The four-lane elevated corridor between Sarda Circle and Nashik Road is planned at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore.

Among other things, Bhujbal also said that the subway at Dwarka should be brought to use for pedestrians and movement of autorickshaws, motorcycles and other smaller vehicles. He said that a down ramp should be constructed on the flyover over the Mumbai-Agra highway near Aurangabad so that motorists from the Mumbai side can descend from the flyover at the Aurangabad road junction instead of driving all the way ahead from the flyover, descending from it and then taking a U-turn to move towards Aurangabad road. He also said that steps should be taken to solve the problem of Indiranagar underpass, converting the existing four-lane Mumbai-Agra highway between Ghoti and Pimpri Sado into a six-lane one.

Senior NHAI officials said that they will study all the instructions by Bhujbal, conduct a meeting with the concerned stakeholders and subsequently speak to their higher authorities about the implementation of the same.

189,['26/01/2020'],HC bench upholds life term given to man by trial court for killing relative,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Aurangabad:The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court recently upheld the verdict of a trial court that sentenced a man to life imprisonment for murdering an autorickshaw driver (Afroz) over suspicion of having illicit relations with the former’s wife in October 2011.

The accused, Shaikh Shafi Shaikh Mustafa (27), a worker from Chikhli (Bk), in Kinwat taluka of Nanded district had approached the HC challenging his sentence of life imprisonment by the trial court, citing some disparities and some witnesses turning hostile

The accused and the deceased were relatives.

According to the prosecution, while waiting for passengers at the Ghanapur Phata in Kinwat taluka, both of them were sitting in an autorickshaw on October 18, 2011, and listening to music. Suddenly, an eyewitness noticed the accused stabbed Afroz in the abdomen with a dagger. Shaikh pulled Afroz out of rickshaw after stabbing him multiple times and slitting his throat while threatening other autorickshaw drivers not to intervene. Later, he sped away on his motorcycle.

The Kinwat police had registered an offence following a complaint by Shaikh Mehboob, the father of the deceased, who had also said Shafi was suspicious of the deceased having an illicit relationship with his wife and murdered him over that.

While dismissing the appeal, the bench comprising Justices T V Nalawade and M G Sewlikar observed: “There are many circumstances which give corroboration to the evidence of the eye witness who has wholeheartedly supported the case of the prosecution.’’ The bench said: “There are circumstances like evidence on the spot panchanama, motive, presence of human blood on the clothes of the accused and presence of blood of the deceased on the weapon which was recovered from the person of the accused. Thus, there is corroboration to the version of the eye witness of all possible nature and due to these circumstances also the circumstance that the police statements were recorded late, on the next day is not sufficient to discard the evidence of the eye witness.’’

The high court also observed “This Court holds that the trial court has not committed any error in believing the eye witness. This Court has discussed the other evidence and even of the hostile witnesses which can be used against the accused in the present matter. Thus, the evidence as available under section 3 of the Evidence Act is more than sufficient to bring home the guilt to the accused. This Court sees no reason to interfere in the decision given by the trial court.’’

And if a person did not win any prize, he would get his Rs 50,000 investment back with Rs 5,000 interest,” explained an official from Jetpur police station.

Though Thumar gave away prizes to winners every month, he decamped with the money of those who did not win any prize and whose time period of 50 months was about to be over.

Stressing that CAA was “100% a big mistake”, he said that he would mobilise support of like-minded regional party leaders and the 15-odd chief ministers, who are against CAA, and hold a conference in Hyderabad soon. “If required a public meeting with 10 lakh people will be organized in the city,” he added.

KCR also said that in his view, the Supreme Court should take up CAA suo moto and scrap it. “I request the prime ministers to withdraw CAA as it is against the preamble of the Constitution,” he said. “The image of our country is at stake globally.”

“Instead of focussing on the important issues like recession, literacy and poverty, the government was raking up the Hindu-Muslim issue,” he said. “Is it good if you send Muslims out of the country? What happens if Hindus living in outside India are asked to leave? Besides, BJP is already losing one states after another. It lost Jharkhand recently and reports indicate that AAP may win Delhi,” the chief minister said.

The TRS supremo blamed the Centre for the economic slowdown in the country. “Economists have been expressing concern over the recession and millions of people have lost their jobs. The states too were suffering because of the economic slowdown.”

He added that the NDA government has not released Rs 34,000 crore to states towards GST relief and other devolution of funds. “The state government is yet to release Rs 1,131 crore and another Rs 2,812 crore towards IGST. I will write a letter to the Prime Minister to release the amount apart from sending a delegation to New Delhi to build pressure on the Centre,” the CM said.

Representative image

RAJKOT: Five fraudsters were booked on Friday night for allegedly usurping 154 bigha land of a farmer worth Rs 22 crore in Changa village on the outskirts of Jamnagar .

Police said the accused, identified as Bharat Dav, Savdas Chawda, Kishor Maharaj, Kripal Sinh and Haresh Chhaiya , allegedly usurped the land belonging to Parshottam Virani by using bogus and forged documents.

According to the police, the accused had approached Virani in July last year. After convincing Virani to sell off the land, they obtained the 7/12 documents of the property, in which apart from Virani, his uncles - Govind Virani, Mansukh Virani, Gordhan Virani and Mawji Virani- and his wife Rasila Virani had been listed as co-owners.

On July 22 last year, the accused met the victims to clinch the deal at the factory belonging to Parshottam’s cousin Magan Virani. The victims had demanded Rs 15 lakh per bigha and the deal was finally clinched at Rs 14.51 lakh per bigha.

In the meeting, the accused asked the victims to hand them over the copies of their PAN, Aadhar card along with their photographs, saying that they wanted to publish a notice in newspaper about the deal.

The accused paid each one of the victims Rs 51,000 as token amount. The accused said they would be paying the 33% of the amount at the end of the notice period to be published in the newspaper and the remaining amount at the time of documentation.

“However, when the accused did not approach the victims after the end of the notice period, the victims decided to cancel the deal and published a notice in a newspaper in that regard. A day after the notice was published, the victim came to know that Dav had filed a claim in a local court of Jamnagar, declaring that the Virani family had sold away their land to them. Realizing the fraud, the victims approached the police with a complaint,” said K K Gohil, sub-inspector with Jamnagar local crime branch.

The feasibility report from the SCR is awaited. Based on the feasibility report, the GHMC will be able to frame the draft project report following which necessary funds can be sought from the state government.“The RK Puram flyover was constructed 19 years ago to manage traffic. Today, the need for an alternative ROB is mandatory to ease the traffic. The growing number of residents in the area and surrounding areas is a clear indication that traffic conditions are likely to turn worse,” said Robin Zaccheus, the RTI activist who filed the application with the GHMC.The RTI applicant had also sought information on break-up of the year-wise expenditure on the repair work on the ROB and safety & stability inspections conducted since the time it was constructed, among others. However, the GHMC did not furnish details of the same.The Ramakrishnapuram railway station level crossing gate 252 was closed in 2001 following construction of the existing ROB. While the GHMC has proposed to construct a parallel ROB, residents of the neighbouring areas who used the existing ROB regularly have sought reopening of the underpass, which has been closed for years now.“A wall has been constructed by the local Army authorities under the ROB, which restricts vehicular movement.

The ruling TRS wiped out the opposition and won more than 90% of the municipalities and almost 80% of the municipal corporations.Of the 120 municipalities and nine municipal corporations for which polls were held, the pink party secured 110 municipalities and seven municipal corporations. The Congress secured six municipalities while BJP won three.Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM for the first time got two municipalities – Bhainsa and Jalpally. Communally sensitive Bhainsa in Nirmal district had seen a clash between two communities on January 12. Interestingly, TRS drew a blank in the town, making it a direct fight between AIMIM and BJP. Of the 32 districts in the state, TRS swept 27 by securing all the municipalities. Congress, BJP and AIMIM got municipal chairperson’s post in five districts.Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao , said parties never get one-side victories in consecutive elections especially in urban local bodies, but TRS has registered victories in all elections held for the past six years. “For other parties, elections are a game, but for TRS, it is a task which is accomplished,” he said.The extent of TRS’s win can be gauged from the fact the party won more than 1,600 of the 2,727 wards. Congress finished a distant second with 508 and BJP got 240. AIMIM won 79 wards and is likely to get Nizamabad municipal corporation with the help of TRS.Independents and candidates who contested on tickets of registered parties won in 258 places. Their support will be crucial in places like Meerpet corporation for mayor’s post.In some municipalities, like Bheemgal in Nizamabad, all 12 wards went to TRS and none of the opposition parties could not get a single seat. In Nizampet, TRS candidate Kasani Sirisha got highest majority of 1,577 votes even as seven independents won here.Voters in the surrounding municipalities of Hyderabad gave different verdicts, especially in Ranga Reddy and Medchal-Malkajgiri districts.

RAJKOT: Two thieves who are part of a three-member Rajasthani gang, were arrested on Saturday for their alleged involvement in Rs 7.52 lakh cash theft from a garment showroom on Dharmendra Road in Rajkot two weeks ago.

Police said the accused, identified as Udailal Charpota (23), Bapulal Ninama (30) and Bhuralal Mahida (31), had broken into Dresswala Showroom on the night of January 8 and had stolen Rs 7.52 lakh cash from the drawer of the cash counter.

The faces of the accused could not be captured on the CCTV camera installed in the showroom, as they were wearing masks. However, when the cops checked the footages of the CCTVs installed along the route to the showroom, they found the car had been parked by the accused near Shastri Maidan .

“On the basis of the registration number of the car, we traced the vehicle to Banswara in Rajasthan. We sent a team of officials to Banswara to find out the owner of the car. Our investigation led us to Charpota and Ninama, subsequent of which we arrested them,” said H M Gadhvi, inspector with Rajkot detection of crime branch.

However, the police are yet to arrest Mahida for the crime.

HYDERABAD: Rebel trouble dented the ruling party’s march towards a near improbable cent per cent victory in the elections.Rebels derailed the party’s prospects in municipalities like Mahbubnagar, Gajwel and Sircilla where they either contested as independents or on the All India Forward Bloc ticket. In Kollapur municipality in Nagarkurnool district, as many as 11 TRS rebel candidates won on Forward Bloc ticket.Reliable sources confirmed to STOI that rebel candidates were fielded by former minister Jupally Krishna Rao,who lost Kollapur in the 2018 assembly elections. Both Kollapur MLA B Harshawardhan Reddy and Krishna Rao have been at loggerheads ever since the former joined the ruling TRS after winning on a Congress ticket and quitting the party after the assembly elections. Harshawardhan even complained to the party leadership against Krishna Rao. In Ieeja municipality in Jogulamba-Gadwal district, 10 independents won on Forwawrd bloc ticket.Though there were hundreds of rebel candidates in the fray, they dented TRS party’s prospects in half a dozen municipalities. For instance, in Sircilla municipality, which is represented by TRS working president KT Rama Rao, 12 independent candidates emerged victorious. Since TRS won the required majority seats of 22, there would not be any impact on bagging the municipal chairperson post.Even in chief minister KCR’s Gajwel constituency, 78 rebels filed their nominations in erstwhile Medak district and 36 of them went on to win as independents. In Dubbak municipality, rebels won 10 wards — more than any political party. TRS bagged nine wards there.Party rebels who won in the elections are now evincing interest to join the ruling party, it is learnt.In Khammam district, two councillors joined TRS in presence of district minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar.

Nashik: The city’s maiden smart road between Trimbak Naka and Ashok Stambh will be inaugurated and thrown open for vehicular traffic on Sunday.

Ahead of the inauguration day, the labourers were seen working aggressively on the stretch to make it ready for Sunday.

On the other hand, the senior police officers expressed their concerns about the road being thrown open for vehicular traffic, even when the road is not fully complete.

The officers said that they will have to deploy additional manpower to monitor the streamflow of traffic.

On Saturday, the labourers were seen working on paver blocks, a couple of feet away from the footpath to create a cycle track. The road was also dug up at a couple of spots for setting up other facilities. The painting work of the road dividers and the traffic island was seen on the stretch.

The stretch all set to become one of the best streets in the city, commuters are complaining about the decreased width of the road and huge bumps in between. While the footpaths are appreciated, currently many motorists are seen parking their vehicles on them.

Gopal Paripurna, an executive working at a private firm on the MG Road said that the cycle track adjacent to the footpath is a waste of money. “All along the footpath, there is a beeline of illegally parked vehicles. Once the road is thrown open for traffic, the cycle track would be under the illegally parked vehicles,” he said.

Police officer, who didn’t wish to be named, said that they feared that once the signals are set operational the traffic at the CBS junction mainly will become chaotic. People coming from the Trimbak Naka side and moving towards Sharanpur Road will not get a clear free left, which will further to the chaos. “On the same junction, the free left for vehicles has been done away. Thus to take a left, motorists will have to wait for the signal to go green,” said the officer.

Many traders, who have their establishments at Ashok Stambh junction said that the road was already falling short for the heavy traffic and now after the smart road work, the width of the road has been further reduced. Senior traffic officials said that they would observe the flow of traffic after the inauguration near Ashok Stambh. If problems occur, the junction will be closed until construction work is fully complete.

KT Rama Rao

HYDERABAD: During his presser, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao was effusive in his praise of party cadre and leaders and even took the name of his son, party working president KT Rama Rao for ensuring a stupendous victory for the party in the elections. KTR , who sat beside his father, was grinning from ear to ear, after earning a rare accolade from his party supremo.

Senior political analysts said KCR ’s acknowledgement was a trigger for bigger role for KTR anytime soon — a fact corroborated by KTR himself when he said Saturday’s win certainly enhanced his role as municipal administration minister with bigger tasks ahead. Party sources said after the outcome, the demand to anoint KTR as chief minister may get shriller.

Several ministers and MLAs have already started raising pitch for KTR as future CM. V Srinivas Goud, Errabelli Dayakar Rao, T Srinivas Yadav and Koppula Eshwar, on several occasions, have openly said KTR will take over the reins of India’s youngest state. What adds to ongoing rumours is KCR’s assertion on playing a bigger role at national level on issues like CAA, NRC and cobbling together a federal front against BJP and Congress-led alliances.

Party sources said the results have not only proved the strength of TRS in both urban and rural areas, but also tightened grip of KTR on TRS. “As he proved his ability to handle both party affairs and in government administration, it will certainly pave the way for his elevation as CM,” a party leader said.

However, KTR himself has been dismissing these speculations. He made it clear that KCR would continue as Telangana CM for the next 10 years. Before appointing KTR as TRS working president a year ago, KCR gave him the responsibility of talking to MLA aspirants and working out strategies for campaigning. KCR also made KTR talk to rebel candidates to withdraw from the fray.

After he assumed charge, KTR successfully took TRS to victory in gram panchayat, Lok Sabha, zilla parishad elections and Huzurnagar bypolls. Except for attending a couple of meetings with ministers, MLAs and MPs, KCR allowed KTR to handle entire poll exercise. This made party leaders and MLAs happy as KTR was accessible to them in Telangana Bhavan.

Hyderabad: TRS may have swept the elections, but its show in Gajwel and Sircilla municipalities was below expectations. Gajwel and Sircilla municipalities fall under assembly constituencies represented by chief minister KCR and his son KT Rama Rao respectively.

Though TRS was expecting a clean sweep in all 20 wards in Gajwel, Congress opened its account by winning one ward. Six independents — all TRS rebels — won leaving the party with victory in only 13 wards. In Sircilla, of the total 39 wards, TRS managed win in 22 wards. BJP secured three and Congress two. Independents (all TRS rebels) emerged victorious in 12 wards.

Taking a dig at KTR , who had predicted that TRS will sweep the elections, BJP state president K Laxman said: “The dismal performance of TRS in KTR’s own constituency of Sircilla shows all is not well with the party. BJP won three seats and independents have fared reasonably well.”

TPCC working president A Revanth Reddy said the fact that 12 TRS rebel candidates contested in Sircilla against the wishes of KTR and another six TRS rebels winning in Gajwel was a testimony to KCR and KTR losing their hold on party members. “TRS ship is overloaded with outsiders and is bound to sink soon,” he said.

Polls were not held for Siddipet municipality, part of Siddipet assembly constituency, represented by Harish Rao.

Nagpur: With their distinct style, Konkan Kanya lived up to their billing as a top entertaining band, by presenting a lively show at Chitnavis Centre in Civil Lines, on Friday. The show was organized by GH Raisoni Sports and Cultural Foundation.

The famous Konkan Kanyas were Nikita Ghate, Arundhati Tendulkar, Duhita Kunkavlekar, Arti Satyapal, Rasika Borkar and Sneha Ayare who doubled up as the host. The band is managed by Raviraj Vijay while Vishal Sutar handles the beats and rhythms. Mrunalini Naik welcomed the band. Chairman of Raisoni group Sunil Raisoni was present.

They girls introduced themselves by their famous song ‘We are Konkan Kanya’ but began their stage show with a devotional song ‘Vakratunda Mahahakaya’.

Gradually they upped the tempo with numbers like ‘Dil hai chhotasa’, ‘Badmash dil’, ‘I love you’ and ‘Tum jo aaye zindagi mein’. Their next four back-to-back songs ‘Navrai Majhi’, ‘Nachde ne saare’, ‘He subharambh’ and ‘London Thumakda’ took the audience to an altogether different plane.

The contestants of ‘Raising Stars’, then tried to slow down the proceedings a bit with ‘Dekha ek khwaab’, ‘Dil ka bhanwar kare pukar’, ‘Sawaar loon’ and ‘Pari hun main’.

In between Sneha Ayare kept tickling the funny bones with humorous shayaris and jokes. The band concluded the show with ‘Jeev Rangala’.

210,['26/01/2020'],Chandrayaan missions renewed world interest in Moon: Scientist,"This story is from January 26, 2020

TRICHY: India’s Chandrayaan missions have triggered renewed interest among other countries towards the Moon, space scientist Mylswamy Annadurai has said. “While Chandrayaan II mission was much discussed the world over, the US has planned to land on Moon again by 2025. Other countries are likely to follow suit,” he said here on Saturday while addressing the valedictory event of the 124th foundation year celebration of Srirangam Educational Society .

The scientist said the rationale behind India’s plan for a manned mission to space is that if countries decide to set up a research centre on Moon, India will very much be part of it. On Chandrayaan – 2, he said the orbiter is still functioning properly and Isro is planning successive missions.

Lauding the achievements of previous Isro missions of which he was an integral part, Mylswamy, who is vice-president of Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology (TNSCST), said they could find water on Moon and send satellite to Mars in the first attempt in the most economic manner. “Now that we are gearing up for the first manned mission to Moon, a half humanoid will be sent in the first stage. Moon’s surface is very uncertain, therefore Isro is sending a machine before sending humans,” he said. On the opportunities in science and research, he said there was a time when questions were raised about sending satellites to the space in the country but now there is so much anticipation on successive Isro space missions.

“Students need to develop skills to match the requirement.

KOMPALLY: It all boiled down to just one vote, which separated the winner from the loser. S Srisailam Yadav of TRS literally snatched victory from the jaws of a defeat in ward No. 3 in Kompally municipality and the sore loser was A Mohan Reddy, who contested the seat on a BJP ticket.A former sarpanch of Kompally, which was a gram panchayat before, Yadav set a unique record in scoring one of the extremely wafer-thin margins of victories in the election. Curtain for the high-voltage three-hour drama was raised by returning officer T Shanker when he announced Yadav as the winner after recounting after both the candidates secured 356 votes each.Recounting was taken up at the Kompally MPP office in the presence of agents of TRS and BJP after the candidates made a demand. “We did recounting twice on secured votes and found that one vote extra was secured by the TRS candidate. We intimated the result to the district election authority, Medchal-Malkajgiri district, and took his consent before declaring the winner,” Shanker told newsmen at the counting centre.“Based on the instructions, rules and regulations prescribed in the election handbook regarding decision of vote which voters affixed seal on the ballot paper, the TRS candidate has secured one extra vote. We declared him as the winner,” he said.However, Mohan was livid and alleged that Kompally municipality election authorities were partisan towards Yadav. Mohan staged a protest along with his followers. A mild tension prevailed at the counting centre.

NASHIK: A discharge slip from the Nashik Civil Hospital found in the trouser pocket of an unidentified deceased person helped the city police to track down his family to Ozar, about 22 km from Nashik city. Incidentally, the deceased person, who was eventually identified as 65-year-old Pralhad Narayan Bachkar, had abandoned his family four decades ago — and had been missing since.

After the police were able to find the family, Bachkar’s son performed his last rites on Wednesday.

An unidentified body was found near the market yard area of Panchavati in the city on January 21. During the course of the investigation, the police found a discharge slip issued by the Nashik Civil Hospital in the trouser pocket of the deceased person. This helped ascertain his identity.

“From the appearance of the deceased, it appeared that he was living the life of a wanderer. He may have been living on alms,” said Ashok Bhagat, the senior police inspector of Panchavati police station. “From the hospital discharge slip, we could ascertain his name and the place he belonged to. We started looking for his family the same day,” Bhagat said.

Police naik Ananda Chaudhary said, “When a body of an unidentified person is found, we send a message with the description of the deceased person across the district. If personnel of any police station feel that the description matches anyone missing in their jurisdiction, their family members are contacted to ascertain the identity.”

In this case, police naik Chaudhary and police constable Arun Gaikwad spread the message about the deceased person on various social media groups of Ozar residents. By Wednesday morning, the police investigation led to one name — Hiraman Pralhad Bachkar, the 48-year-old son of the deceased. When the two constables contacted Hiraman, they learned that Pralhad Bachkar had left his home about 40 years ago.

Hiraman too was in a state of shock. “Hiraman’s mother (Pralhad’s wife) is no more. He said he barely remembered his father as he was too young when his father left them. Identifying his father’s body was, therefore, out of the question for him. However, some elder members of the family were able to identify the deceased man and the body was handed over to them.”

Hiraman said that while he had no hopes of ever meeting his father, he was grateful that he could at least perform his last rites.

HYDERABAD: The urban local body elections on Saturday clearly indicate that the political graph of BJP is on the ascent in Telangana with the saffron party winning nearly 240 municipal wards and divisions. The saffron party has improved its performance and tally not only in the municipalities and corporations in the state, but gained significantly in urban local bodies on the periphery of Greater Hyderabad.

BJP won three municipalities — Amangal, Tukkuguda and Makthal — and emerged as single largest party in Nizamabad municipal corporation and a couple of other local bodies.

Though BJP finished at third place behind TRS and Congress, which were first and second respectively, the results of the 2020 municipal polls is no mean achievement for BJP, which had managed to win just 167 wards and divisions in the 2014 ULB polls, that too after contesting the elections in alliance with TDP then. This time BJP went alone.

Even though BJP did not have candidates in 700-odd of the 3,052 wards that went to polls, the saffron party not only improved its tally, but has managed to get representation in over 60% of the total 129 municipalities and municipal corporations which went to the polls on January 22.

In the Meerpet municipal corporation, BJP emerged as the second largest party, winning 16 wards as against 19 by TRS and three by Congress. In the Badangpet corporation, the saffron party was runner-up with 10 seats against 13 by TRS and seven by Congress.

However, BJP leaders, including its state president K Laxman, who have been claiming that BJP has emerged as an alternative to the ruling TRS and is the main opposition party in Telangana, was no match to TRS. Also, BJP secured 50% less wards than the Congress.

In 2014, we had contested municipal election in alliance with TDP,” he said.

Stating that BJP’s vote percentage increased to 40% this time as against 20% in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, he said despite large-scale malpractices, including distribution of money and misuse of official machinery by TRS, BJP’s performance is a good sign for party’s growth. Laxman alleged the polls were most expensive with TRS candidates luring voters by doling out Rs 30,000 per vote in some wards. “In some cases, TRS candidates spent Rs 1 crore in each ward,” he alleged.

HYDERABAD: The TRS juggernaut was nowhere visible in Bhainsa in Nirmal district as the ruling party drew a blank and AIMIM bagged Bhainsa municipality by emerging victorious in 15 wards. There are 26 wards in all. BJP came second by winning nine wards, while independents secured the remaining two. Congress failed to win even a single ward.

Less than a fortnight ago, Bhainsa town was rocked by communal violence that left 19 persons, including eight cops, injured. Analysts said MIM and BJP leaders could succeed in polarising the voters, going by the result on Saturday. This is the second urban local body won by MIM on its own in Telangana. The Majlis party contested, in all, 276 wards and divisions.

BJP, on the other hand, charged the TRS with fielding dummy candidates and indirectly helping its friendly ally, AIMIM, win the municipality.

On January 12, a trivial issue took violent and communal turn when members belonging to two communities clashed late in the night. Next day, members from both sides clashed again and stones were pelted. Fourteen houses were damaged and 30 vehicles burnt. Following the arson and violence, 13 cases were registered and 61 persons from both the communities arrested.

The IMA Agra also plans to help patients who are advised at the OPD to undergo a surgery to get it done in a private hospital at a concessional rate. Similarly, the IMA is in touch with private pathology labs to conduct tests of patients referred by its OPD at concessional rates.

Besides, operating the charitable clinic, IMA will also be launching an awareness campaign against diabetes and cancer. Schools and colleges will be incorporated in the campaign.

226,['26/01/2020'],Private bus operators call for strike on February 4,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Thrissur: The private bus operators in Kerala have called for an indefinite strike from February 4.

The private bus operators’ co-ordination committee said that all 13 private bus associations will be a part of the strike.

The co-ordination committee has raised various demands, including hike in bus fare and revision in student’s concessions. It was in November that the transport minister assured to conduct talks before December 5 and solve the issues. But after one month, the government failed to conduct talks, said Kerala state private bus operators’ federation general secretary, Lawrence Babu.

“We have demanded a rise in minimum charge from Rs 8 to Rs 10. The government should implement KSRTC model concession system to students. We will not agree to the fare hike without rise of student’s concession. Only 50% concession can be allowed for students. In the future, we will not give concession to self-financing college students,” said all Kerala Bus operator’s organization general secretary, K Gopinathan.

The bus fare was hiked in March 2018 when the diesel price was Rs 62. Now the diesel prices have increased to Rs 73. It is difficult to operate bus services without fare revision. In 2011, there were 34,000 private buses plying in the state and now it has been reduced to just 12,000. If the present situation continues, we can’t manage the private bus industry, said co-ordination committee leaders.

“Our demand is that the government should raise student’s concession to Rs 5 per student. The parallel KSRTC chain service in the same routes as private operators is also affecting the private bus industry,"" said Gopinathan.

228,['26/01/2020'],Man who saved lives of 23 bus passengers on Yamuna eway to be honoured on R-day,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Agra: On 71st Republic Day, on Sunday, Agra police will confer ‘prashasti patra’ (citation letter) to 27-year-old Nihal Singh who saved the lives of 23 passengers on Yamuna expressway last July after an ill-fated UPSRTC bus fell from a bridge and plunged into a narrow drain, killing 29 passengers.

Resident of Chaugan Baghel Ki Thar village of Etmadpur police jurisdiction, Singh, on the morning of July 8, witnessed the bus accident and rushed to save passengers, while he was working at his farm field. His prompt action helped save many lives.

Speaking to TOI on Saturday, Singh said, “I’m happy for the award. But, if the government can build a road for my village and help me get a job then that will be more useful to me and for my family.”

Last year, the then district magistrate N G Ravi Kumar of Agra assured Singh of getting a job.

“Due to poverty I could study only till eighth class, but don’t want the same fate for my children. I want to provide them education so that they could live a respectful life and become self-reliant. My qualifications are low, but not my ambition. I’m a hard working farmer, I just need a little help from the government,” said Singh, father of four children, including twin daughters Payal (4) and Pari (4). His two sons Krishna (8) and Tarun (6) are students of local government primary school.

Singh added, “Our village has a government primary school as well as electricity connection in every household, but local villagers travel for nearly one km on the unmetalled road to reach the highway in order to travel to the city. Things become very difficult for us in monsoon season. I hope the award ceremony will give me a platform to put forward the villagers’ demands.”

Ram Singh and Ramkali, parents of Nihal Singh, also expressed their happiness over the honour bestowed on their youngest son for his courage. Singh is among a total of six siblings, including two sisters.

“Since childhood, Nihal Singh has been a humble and shy man. He has a stammer issue. But last year, he showed enough courage and presence of mind to save many lives. Since he had no mobile, he requested an injured passenger to give his phone so that he could call the expressway rescue team for help. Initially, the passenger was hesitant, but Nihal convinced him that he won’t steal his phone, rather help him and others,” said Ram Singh, the braveheart’s father.

Rakesh Singh, gram pradhan of Chaugan, said, “Nihal has made the entire village proud. We hope the district administration will pay heed to his demand.” While speaking to TOI, Asutosh Dubey, personal assistant of Agra DM Prabhu Narain Singh, said, “We are aware of Nihal Singh’s request and will do the needful.”

Representative image

BENGALURU: Three people have been arrested by Tilaknagar police on charges of running a Ponzi scheme through which they had collected around Rs 77 crore from more than 2,000 customers in the past four years.

The arrested are Manjunath, 31, from Vishveshwaraiah Layout in Devarachikkanahalli, and Habibulla Shareef, 37 and Masiullah Shareef, 32, from Doddakammanahalli. Police said the accused ran a firm called Tiforp Trading Services Pvt Ltd in Jayanagar 9th Block since 2015 and promised a monthly return of around 10 per cent on investments.

They held events in and around Jayanagar and promoted their scheme on Facebook and other social media platforms to attract customers. For a few months, investors got the promised interest, but it stopped subsequently.

Trouble began in November 2018 after the firm stopped giving interest to investors. Though people made several rounds to the company, the owners failed to keep their word and instead, requested customers not to approach police. In May 2019, after the I Monetary Advisory (IMA) scam made headlines, the trio closed the firm and fled. The investors later formed a group and started negotiating with the firm owners. When that didn’t yield any result, they began to file police complaints January 14 onwards.

Police said the accused led a lavish life, which included foreign trips. A BMW car, Hyundai Tucson, Toyota Innova and two bikes were seized from the trio, who have immovable properties worth over Rs three crore.

Sources said the accused collected money claiming they were in real estate and foreign currency exchange businesses. Efforts are on to trace some others involved in the scam who fled with the money.

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: Dindori MP Bharti Pawar has written to the Bhusawal divisional railway manager seeking additional stoppages to Rajya Rani Express and also additional coaches for the train.

In a letter dated January 21, she has demanded additional facilities in the train for the convenience of passengers travelling from Nashik region towards Mumbai by the train. The train that originally ran between Manmad Junction (Nashik) and Mumbai, was extended recently up till Nanded.

Daily travellers of the Rajya Rani Express had opposed the extension of the train. Claiming that the regular travellers and monthly season ticket holders hardly find space to sit in the train now, Pawar has asked for more coaches.

‘Since the commuters don’t find seats and have to travel standing for three to four hours, the railways should take measures to ensure they travel comfortably. The railways should therefore arrange for at least two additional coaches,’ MP Dindori wrote in the letter.

The MP also underlined the need for more stoppages for the train to accommodate people from the region. ‘The Railways also should consider stoppage for the train at Niphad and Lasalgaon railway stations. Residents of these two towns do not have any train in the early hours to travel to Mumbai. Adding these two stoppages would cut down the hardships of the people,’ Pawar said in the letter.

Box : Spl train for feast of Infant Jesus shrine

The Central Railway has decided to run special train from Dadar to Nashik Road on February 8 to enable travellers from Mumbai to reach the Infant Jesus Shrine for the annual feast. The Annual Feast is held on second Sunday of February and the train will leave Dadar station at 7.50 am to reach Nashik Road at 11.10 am.

232,['26/01/2020'],Sanjay Place traders form human chain to protest against parking fee,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Agra: There seems to be no let-up in the protests being staged by the traders of Sanjay Place here against Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) administration for charging parking fee at 44 places in the market. On Saturday, more than 250 traders formed a human chain as a mark of protest. They claimed that the parking fee violates norms as they had already paid a fee for parking at the time of purchasing the property.

The traders have been staging protests since January 14. So far, no official of the civic body or any public representative has come to meet the traders.

Claiming that the parking fee is illegal, the traders have been using the public address system to urge vehicle owners not to pay for parking.

On their part, the parking contractors have said they have been authorized by the AMC administration to charge a parking fee.

Meanwhile, police on Friday, following a complaint of a parking contractor, registered an FIR against leaders of the protesters -- Hiren Agarwal, Vinay Mittal, KN Agnihotri, Komal Surana and 20-25 unidentified people.

The FIR has been registered under IPC section 147 (punishment for rioting), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 352 (punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation).

The dispute over parking fee between traders of Sanjay Place and AMC) is sub judice. The traders want AMC to cancel the parking contracts till the court delivers its final orders in the matter.

KN Agnihotri, president of the Sanjay Place Market Association, said, “Not able to face the traders raising genuine questions, AMC administration has got a fake FIR registered against the peaceful protestors. We will continue our fight against the extortion in the name of parking fee.”

Hiren Agarwal, secretary of the market association, said, “The AMC administration is trying to exploit traders by illegally charging the parking fee. We have already paid for the parking space. To muzzle the voice of the traders, a fake FIR has been registered. We will continue our fight against the parking mafia.”

Association’s treasurer Vinay Mittal alleged that despite the ongoing case at the sessions court, the AMC administration had issued parking contracts for three years to people associated with BJP. “AMC officials also get a share of the parking fee illegally collected from the market. We will not withdraw our protest till the AMC rolls back its decision,” he said.

BENGALURU: An MBA graduate and civil services aspirant has knocked on the doors of police alleging she was cheated of Rs 5 crore by a fifty-year-old man who claimed to have hoarded $343 million (Rs 2,400 crore) in a bank in the US.

The woman, Radhika Reddy (name changed on request), is a resident of Kalyannagar and belongs to a family that owns huge tracts of land in Bengaluru. She has filed a complaint with Hebbagodi police against Krishnegowda , a resident of Kolar, his wife Kavitha K Gowda, their son Dheeraj and friend Manjunath.

Radhika was introduced to him by a police officer currently working in Bengaluru Rural district and an assistant conservator of forests in March 2018. Police said Krishnegowda allegedly claimed he had worked in Dubai for 18 years and ran a paper factory along with other businesses. He maintained he returned to India after working abroad and had earned over Rs 2,400 crore. However, there were procedural complications in bringing the money stashed in the US.

A smooth-talking Krishnegowda said he required a huge amount of money to pay taxes and other fee to get his money. He assured Radhika he would give her a large share if she provided funds to retrieve the money. The woman took her family into confidence stating their chances of striking a jackpot were high by helping Krishnegowda. Since June 2018, Krishnegowda succeeded in taking lakhs of rupees from Radhika stating he wanted to get a clearance certificate from Reserve Bank of India (RBI), insurance certificate and cited other trivial reasons.

Radhika sold 2.5kg gold and a vacant site, worth Rs two crore, in Ramamurthynagar to pay Krishnegowda. However, she soon realised that even her relatives were paying him hoping to become rich quickly and all of them were being taken for a ride. Radhika told STOI she used to meet Krishnegowda every day for many months but he stopped meeting her and switched off his mobile.

Police said Radhika’s ancestral property was sold and pledged as her family also supported her. Preliminary probe suggested several cheating complaints were registered against Krishnegowda in Bengaluru where he lured people and siphoned off their money.

Hebbagodi police said Krishnegowda portrayed he had enough money and wanted to give it to people he ‘loved’ and ‘cared for’. While on one hand he spoke to his victims emotionally, on the other he took advantage of their greed to cheat them, police said. ""We have basic information about his whereabouts,"" police said.

236,['26/01/2020'],Consumer forum orders insurance firm to settle claim,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Nashik: The Nashik District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum has ordered the Oriental Insurance Company to settle a claim of Rs 5 lakh that was raised by a city resident following the death of his mother due to injury in 2017.

Complainant Dheeraj Sevakramani had insured his family members in 2009 and renewed their policies regularly.

On July 17, 2017, Sevakramani’s mother was admitted to a hospital because of illness. When she was about to be discharged on July 31, she suffered a fall in the bathroom of the hospital and on October 21, succumbed to head injuries that had also left her paralysed.

Sevakramani filed for a claim of Rs 5 lakh from Oriental Insurance. But the company rejected the death claim on December 20, 2017, on the grounds that the death was caused not by accident, but illness. The company also claimed that Sevakramani had concealed certain details related to his mother’s illness at the time of getting the policy.

“The mother of the complainant was suffering from several diseases which have been mentioned in the death certificated issued for the deceased. Besides, the certificate also mentions these diseases as the cause of death along with the fall. This violates the terms and conditions of the insurance,” company counsel SS Purnapatre had claimed.

But counsel for the complainant, P R Chandrakor, pointed out that hospital had mentioned several diseases as the ‘antecedent cause’ in the ‘cause of death certificate’ but at the same time, the ‘immediate cause of death’ was attributed to ‘Cerebrovascular Accident’ which meant injury to brain.

The three-member redressal forum, headed by president Milind Sonawane, said the insurance company had erred on rejecting the claim of the complainant without any valid reason and hence amounted to deficiency in services. The forum said the insurance company had not come up with proof to counter the claim of the medical certificate mentioning the ‘immediate cause of death’ as head injury. It then ordered the company to settle the claim of Rs 5 lakh along at a 9% rate of interest from December 20, 2017, when the case was rejected.

The forum also ordered Rs 7,000 as compensation for mental harassment of the consumer and Rs 5,000 as compensation for costs incurred.

Dehradun: To help tourists and pilgrims who get stranded in remote Himalayan areas where internet connectivity is poor or missing, the State Disaster Response Force ( SDRF ) has come up with a mobile app , which will work offline also.

Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Saturday launched the app ‘Meri Yatra’, which will give users health tips, updates of hotels,weather information and navigation support.

SDRF commandant Tripti Bhatt said that more features will be added in the app soon. While launching the app, the CM lauded the efforts of the SDRF for coming up with the useful app which has been created in a budget of Rs 2.4 lakh. “The year 2019 saw a record turnout of pilgrims to the Char Dham Yatra and we expect the number to be higher this year. This application will be extremely useful for the devotees as well as adventure sport lovers who come to Uttarakhand,” the CM said.

Sharing more information, SDRF IG Sanjay Gunjyal said that it can be downloaded through Google store. “Trekkers and adventure sport lovers go to remote areas, which are often not connected with internet. In case of any calamity or accident, it becomes difficult to track and rescue them. Therefore, this app has been designed in a manner that it can also work in the absence of internet,” Gunjyal said.

He added that through the app, tourists can also get weather updates. “We will inform the tourists about the do and don’t’s of a particular area, health tips, required medicines, places of stay, clothes to wear and travel connectivity,” Gunjyal said.

Besides, emergency numbers, cellphone numbers of senior state officers, details of district disaster management team, Char Dham route map and location of nearest SDRF post would be mentioned in the app, the official said.

Dakota (VT-AUI) aircraft belongs to the erstwhile Kalinga airlines, which was founded by former chief minister Biju Patnaik. With the help of this aircraft, he had flown out Sultan Sjahrir, the Prime Minister of Indonesia, from a jungle hideout and had reached India on July 24, 1947, on the instructions of then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The family of former sarpanch ( Dumuriput ) Uttarkabat Apparao Choudhury submitted a proposal to district collector Madhusudan Mishra in this regard.

“Biju Patnaik’s contribution in establishing the engine division of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) at Sunabeda in the mid 60s was huge. Our region received national importance because of his contribution. HAL has strengthened the tribal economy of the region,” Loknath Choudhury, son of the former sarpanch, said.

“To honour and acknowledge his role in developing the area, the family has decided to donate two acres of land at Dumuriput mouza,” he added. Dumuriput, which is 5 km from the HAL’s engine division at Sunabeda on NH-26, was the first adopted village of the navratna PSU.

“As HAL is involved in manufacturing the fighter aircraft for the Indian Air Force, we are hopeful that the state government will agree on our proposal,” Loknath said.

“It was for Biju Patnaik that a unit of HAL could be established in the district. The family deciding to offer two acres of prime land to keep Dakota aircraft is praiseworthy. If the government accepts the proposal and develop the place into a heritage site, it will be a sacred place for Biju lovers. It will boost tourism in the district,” former district collector Gadadhar Parida said.

240,['26/01/2020'],ACM raids unearth rampant corruption in revenue offices,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Vijayawada: Friday’s surprise raids by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) at the offices of 21 mandal revenue officers (tahsildars) in all 13 districts have revealed the extent of the rot in revenue offices.

A common trend across all tahsildar offices, ACB officials noted, was the presence of undistributed pattadar passbooks and unaccounted cash. Officials also noticed private persons were engaged by some tehsildars to carry out official work.

With the public dependent on revenue offices to procure caste certificates and address proof, several petitioners complained of being harassed by tahsildars in order to get their official work done. Land-related issues, however, are the major source of corruption for revenue officials.

Over the years, the revenue department has faced criticism from farmers in delay in issuance of pattadar passbooks and making changes to ownership of land records in cases of mutation or sale of land. Extending bribes to officials to get pattadar passbooks, even when records are in order, have become a norm in the state.

ACB officials said the modus operandi of revenue officials was to hold back pattadar passbooks in order to collect money from farmers. Causing intentional delays in rendering services beyond the service level agreement (SLA) period would force farmers to extend bribes.

Speaking to STOI, director general of the ACB, PSR Anjaneyulu said they have identified irregularities ranging from rejection of certificates to the presence of unaccounted money. “We also suspect that revenue officials are in nexus with Meeseva centres, which will be established in further investigation,” he said.

Additionally, the raids revealed the presence of private persons at government offices collecting money from the public on behalf of officials. Anjaneyulu said some officials reject genuine applications without citing valid reasons in order to exact bribes. “We are digging deeper into the issues and erring officials will be booked,” said Anjaneyulu.

HYDERABAD: In a video footage captured by STOI, some unknown persons were seen revealing number of votes and other details of election results to party workers at Aurora’s Technological and Research Institute, the counting centre for Peerzadiguda Municipal Corporation. The incident came to light after a supporter of an independent candidate informed media personnel about the issue.

The individuals in the video can be seen shouting out results from one of the windows in the building’s top floor while counting of votes was still in progress. “They are shouting the results from the counting hall. There is not even a single policeman guarding the area behind the counting centre. This is completely against the model code of conduct. The authorities have completely failed in making arrangements,” said Ravi Kishore, a supporter.

When questioned about the security arrangements in the area behind the counting centre, the police official at the front of the counting centre said: “We are sending our officials. No one is allowed to go behind the building.”

Elsewhere, at the Lords Institute of Engineering & Technology in Himayathsagar where counting for Narsingi, Manikonda and Shamshabad municipalities along with Bandlaguda Municipal Corporation, police personnel armed with only batons had a hard time keeping away crowds from entering the premises. There had been no arrangements made by police for barricades and many were seen trying to get in by jumping the wall.

Inside the premises, a heated argument broke out when the winning candidate for Shamshabad Ward 1, Congress ’ Geetha R and her husband were coming out of the premises. Seeing a crowd build up around them, the police is said to have pushed them towards the media and infuriating them in the process. “They should not have pushed us this way,” Geetha said but later acknowledged that “such incidents happen in the moment.” Rajendranagar ACP K Chakravarthy also said that such incidents are expected with large turnouts.

While in Janagaon TRS supporters greeted each other by smearing themselves with pink colour, at TRS Bhavan in Hyderabad, workers celebrated the party’s victory by distributing sweets, breaking out into a victory dance and playing drums and other musical instruments.

HYDERABAD: Has TRS president, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s gambit of making ministers and MLAs accountable for ensuring party candidates’ win in the elections paid off? It appears so.Of 32 districts (except Hyderabad) that went to polls, the ruling party swept to victory in 27 districts. In five others — Jogulamba-Gadwal, Wanaparthy, Nagarkurnool, Nalgonda and Rangareddy, the opposition Congress and BJP secured municipalities and more number of wards.While Mahbubnagar is ministers S Niranjan Reddy and V Srinivas Goud’s turf, G Jagadish Reddy is from Nalgonda and Sabita Indra Reddy hails from Rangareddy.Some time before the elections, the chief minister warned that he would not hesitate to drop ministers if they fail to get him the desired result. He also warned them against encouraging groupism and indiscipline in the party.Sources said the party leadership this time gave powers to ministers and MLAs to select candidates and issue form-Bs to declare them as official candidates. They were also involved in the exercice to convince the rebels to withdraw from the fray with a promise to get them nominated or co-option posts.With this assurance, ministers and MLAs not only toured and campaigned in respective municipalities but also went to the rebel candidates’ houses to bring them back into party’s fold. In Peerzadiguda municipal corporation, Medchal incharge minister Ch Malla Reddy went to house of a senior leader, who joined Congress, and brought him back into the party within hours. Similarly, a ruling party leader in CM’s Gajwel constituency succeeded in bringing back a worker from Congress to TRS fold on the same day.Despite party leadership’s efforts, some municipalities, however, were bagged by Congress and BJP. “If there are any special conditions and reasons for failure , the party may not view it seriously. Congress and BJP won in the districts, which were earlier dominated by Congress. Also, Congress has more MLAs from these districts,” a TRS politburo member explained.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73629728,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-239703,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcrs-sack-warning-to-mins-mlas-did-the-trick/articleshow/73621082.cms

246,['26/01/2020'],‘CAA may put national security under threat’,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Firdos Mirza

Along with Delhi and rest of the country, the state’s second capital is also witnessing large-scale protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Leading the charge are primarily the youngsters, besides Muslims — most of whom believe that the new legislation targets their community. However, many are unaware of the minutiae of the amended law, according to noted lawyer Firdos Mirza.

An expert in matters pertaining to the Constitution, Mirza says that the law is not only discriminatory towards Muslims, but works against all citizens who do not have “valid” documents to prove their place of birth. In an exclusive tête-à-tête with TOI, he tries to correct many misconceptions about the new legislation. Excerpts...

Q. Please explain CAA.

A. The law prescribes grant of citizenship to illegal migrants belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, who entered India on or before December 31, 2014, without any verification.

Q. Which documents are required to prove citizenship?

A. If the media is to be believed, documents like Aadhaar, voter ID, PAN card or passport would not be sufficient for proving citizenship. However, there is no clarity on the documents (apart from the birth certificate) actually required to prove that someone is an Indian citizen. A UNICEF report states that only 58% births are registered in India, which means that the remaining 42% go undocumented every year.

Q. It is perceived that CAA is against the Muslim community.

A. Not only Muslims, the law is against the entire country; and its implementation may put national security under threat. Its provision of granting citizenship to those from neighbouring countries threatens national security, as the entry of undesired elements cannot be ruled out. Even hardened criminals and terrorists can become citizens of India and pose dangers to the nation’s peace and tranquillity.

Q. Why are Muslims agitated?

A. Muslims are the most law-abiding citizens of India. The spirit of Indian Constitution is brotherhood, equality and justice; but the linking of religion to citizenship in CAA breaches that spirit. The community considers it a direct assault on the constitutional set-up of the country, which may have far-reaching repercussions. Right now, the Act is leading to religious discrimination against the five lakh Muslims who were left out in NRC in Assam. Since everyone needs to get registered under NRC, the onus of proving that they are not foreigners will fall on all individuals. This entire exercise could lead to a huge humanitarian crisis.

Q. There is a lot of talk about National Population Register (NPR).

A. The Citizenship Act, 1955, does not prescribe the preparation of NPR or any such register by the central government. The reference to the population register is made through a subordinate legislation, i.e. the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003.

Q. How are NPR and NRC related?

A. Both are part of same process. NPR contains details of persons residing in various parts of India, and is prepared by collecting information related to them by the local registrar. For NRC, the local registrars need to verify and scrutinize the information collected in NPR. It would be on their discretion to declare any citizen as dubious. Such persons then need to satisfy the taluka registrar or sub-district registrar about them being Indian citizens. Thereafter, a draft NRC would be registered, inviting objections on the inclusion of any name. After consideration of such objections, the NRC would be published. Those who are left out could make an appeal to the district registrar, whose order would be final.

Q. There are speculations that orphans would suffer the most after CAA and NRC.

A. Section 3 of Citizenship Act deals with ‘Citizenship by Birth’. Accordingly, if CAA is implemented, then the children born to illegal migrants belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before December 31, 2014, would be Indian citizens.

Children born after December 3, 2004 to Muslim parents, and to all others after December 31, 2014 whose parent(s) fail to prove their citizenship would not be treated as Indian citizens, and would be deemed as stateless persons born in India with no other country to go to. Orphans would suffer the same fate, as they would not be able to prove who their parents are.

Q. What about transgenders, destitutes, homeless and aged people, sannyasis, monks and persons with mentally disabilities?

A. Only if they have a record of their parents, would they be treated as Indian citizens.

Q. Isn’t NRC good, as the country would have a list of all citizens and infiltrators would be filtered out?

A. NRC was introduced in Assam upon allegations of demographical changes, based on a survey. It stated that the 1 crore infiltrators staying there were converting the state’s ethnic population into a minority. After a gigantic exercise by 52,000 officials for around eight years, at the cost of over Rs1,600 crore, only 19 lakh persons were identified to not be a part of NRC, and of them only around five lakh are Muslims. Even family members of most of the five lakh people are included in NRC.

By implementing CAA, the illegal migrants would be granted citizenship based on their religion. Later, through NRC, all the existing residents would be forced to prove their citizenship by submitting documents while standing in serpentine queues, and thereafter through appeals and finally, facing the foreign tribunals. The road ultimately ends at detention camps.

Is the problem of illegal migrants so gigantic that we are making every Indian stand in a queue?

Q. Why are people talking about detention centres?

A. In CAA, a reference has been made to the British-made law ‘The Foreigners Act, 1946’, which is made applicable to the entire country, except Assam. This Act provides for detention of those who are found to be foreigners, until they are themselves able to prove that they are not. Till that time, they would be placed in detention centres. Once a person is declared to not be a citizen of India, s/he loses rights under the Constitution and other laws, including voting rights.

Q. Why are minorities opposing CAA when it is meant to provide justice to the persecuted minorities?

A. CAA nowhere mentions the word ‘persecution’, nor does it elaborate what is meant by it. There is no data available or case reported to be pending in international courts about the persecution of minorities. The proven persecution is of Tamil Hindus in Sri Lanka and Rohingya Hindus in Myanmar, but they are conspicuously left out for no reason. The Ahmadiyya community and Shias of Indian origin are two of the most persecuted minorities in Pakistan, and they are also left out.

This Act seems to be malicious, and prima facie contrary to the provisions of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India — which guarantee equality before law and right to life.

Gandhi Bhavan wore a deserted look on Saturday. Congress is said to have performed below its expectations

HYDERABAD: With victories in over 500 wards and divisions in the elections to the 129 urban local bodies, the Congress has cemented its position as the main opposition in the state. The party’s tally is second highest after the ruling TRS which won in over 1,500 wards and divisions. Earlier, Congress was only second to TRS in the elections to gram panchayats, MPTCs and ZPTCs.

The Congress had won four and was leading in two urban local bodies (at the time of this report) — Adibhatla, Pedda Amberpet, Turkayamjal, Waddepalli, Chandur and Haliya — as against three won by BJP.

It stood second in a majority of the 120 municipalities that went to polls. Though the Congress finished in second place in six of the total nine municipal corporations the results for which were announced on Saturday, it was the BJP that won more number of divisions than Congress when it came to municipal corporations.

The BJP won 65 municipal divisions as against 40 by the Congress. They finished second in Ramagundam, Bandlaguda Jagir, Boduppal, Peerzadiguda and Jawaharnagar municipal corporations.

However, Congress’ performance is below its own expectations with the party failing to secure a majority in the urban local bodies in Nalgonda and Malkajgiri parliamentary constituencies, strongholds represented by state party president chief N Uttam Kumar Reddy and TPCC working president A Revanth Reddy.

The only solace was winning a few urban local bodies falling in the jurisdiction of Bhuvanagiri parliamentary constituency represented by former minister Komatireddy Venkat Reddy of Congress. In 2014 municipal elections, the Congress had won 19 urban local bodies.

TPCC working president A Revanth Reddy attributed TRS’ victory to alleged misuse of official machinery and distribution of cash and liquor by ruling party.

AGRA/GUWAHATI: Aligarh police on Saturday booked Jawaharlal Nehru University student Sharjeel Imam for sedition days after the purported video of a speech he had delivered at Aligarh Muslim University on January 16 against the Citizenship Amendment Act and NRC went viral on social media.

In the video, Imam, a software engineer who studies modern Indian history at JNU and was a teaching assistant at IIT Bombay , can be heard saying that if he can organise five lakh people, it would be possible to “permanently cut off Assam with the rest of India...if not permanently, then at least for a few months... only then will the government hear our voice”.

Imam, who lives in Delhi, has been booked under sections 124 A (sedition), 153 A (provocation with intent to cause riots), 153 B (causing disharmony) and 505 (2) of the IPC at the Civil Lines police station.

DIG (Aligarh) Akash Kulhary said, “During investigations, it was found that the purported video, in which the suspect made some anti-national statements, was shot on the AMU campus when he was addressing protesting students.” He added that Imam will be arrested soon.

This came even as the Assam Police followed suit and filed an FIR against Imam under similar charges. In the video, Imam is further heard saying: “The model of the Shaheen Bagh protest is that of road blockade, rest is secondary. Understand the difference between chakka jam and dharna. Protest in every city, tell the people about chakka jam, prepare and then sit on national highways.”

BJP's national spokesperson Sambit Patra shared the video on Twitter and later at a press conference, organised at the party's headquarters in Delhi, called it an “open call for jihad and finishing the sovereignty of the country.” He first said the speech was made at Shaheen Bagh but later when it became clear that it was at AMU, Patra said the new fact did not make the issue ""less grave"".

However, a statement released by the women of Shaheen Bagh on their official twitter account while reacting to talk on social media that Imam had made the comments as ""organiser"" of Shaheen Bagh said: ""No one person, whether Sharjeel Imam or someone else, can be termed as the sole organiser of the protest. The protest has been led by the women of Shaheen Bagh and it is unfair to associate their voice with any distorted media narrative... We urge everyone to not be influenced by ...claims made of representing this non-partisan citizen's movement.""

Imam, who was involved with the Shahen Bagh protests in the early days, is a computer science postgraduate from IIT Bombay and is originally from Patna. He did his schooling from DPS Vasant Kunj in Delhi and even worked as IT programmer at the University of Copenhagen before coming to JNU.

VIJAYAWADA: The Kanaka Durga flyover is likely to miss the deadline, again. Officials who promised to complete the project by January 31, has now extended the deadline to February 29.

Although chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy had directed the officials to complete the flyover project by December 2019, the contracting agency has cited interruptions due to Dasara celebrations and Bhavani Deeksha Viramana for failing to complete the project by January 1. Krishna district collector A MD Imtiaz who inspected the work, extended the deadline by a month. Officials have claimed that around 90% of the project work has already been completed.

Meanwhile, Vijayawada MP Kesineni Nani and Vijayawada East legislator Gadde Ramamohana Rao, accompanied by TDP supporters, inspected the ongoing works of Benz Circle flyover.

Kesineni Nani said the vision of former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu helped Vijayawada get a new look with the support of central funds. “I thank Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari for supporting us and giving funds for key flyover projects in the city. This project will help reduce traffic. We hope other projects in the city will be completed soon,” he said.

The BJP office in city was mostly empty on Saturday. BJP stood third in the overall tally, behind TRS and Cong... Read More

HYDERABAD: It was a close call for the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) in the elections for the Nizamabad Municipal Corporation in which the party won 28 seats. It did emerge as the single largest party with the TRS and AIMIM winning 12 and 17 respectively, taking their combined number to 29. The Congress managed to win two while one division was bagged by an independent. The BJP had only managed to win six divisions in the 2014 elections.

The TRS will bank heavily on bagging the support of the two Congress and one independent winners to take the total rally to 32. The magic figure to get the mayoral post is 31.With elections for the mayor’s post scheduled for January 27, all eyes are now on whether the TRS-AIMIM combine would once again bag the post or whether the BJP can manage to emerge victorious but from where can it get the desired number remains a big question.

Despite three BJP MPs getting elected in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in the districts, the party’s performance in the municipal elections did not match the projections it had made for itself. In the results declared for 120 municipalities on Saturday, the BJP could bag only two municipalities. In nine municipal corporations, BJP emerged in the second position in the number of wards it won but overall in the state, including in municipalities, it came third after as Congress bagged second position in number of wards won. BJP won 223 seats, while Congress got 495 and the TRS won from more than 1,000 wards. Elections were held for 2,727 wards.

Nizamabad MP Arvind Dharmapuri, while thanking the people of ‘Induru’, said he was dedicating the win to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He alleged that in Division 21, a recounting was done unnecessarily and the TRS candidate was declared elected. The MP said that in Ward 1 too the ballot box seal was found opened but counting was still taken up by officials. He demanded a re-poll in both Wards 1 and 21. “People voted against the AIMIM and it is clear. In many divisions, BJP candidates won by a margin of over 1,000 votes,” Dharmapuri said.

For the MP, what could be encouraging is that the party’s tally of six in the 2014 election, has gone up to 28 in this election. The BJP which dreamt of capturing the mayoral post will be disheartened if it does not. Both Arvind Dharmapuri and also Goshamahal MLA Raja Singh who campaigned relentlessly announced that the name of Nizamabad would be changed to Induru if it came to power. The corporation has 60 divisions.

BJP state president K Laxman said the results demonstrated that the BJP was the only alternative to the TRS in the state. “We will analyse the results and take measures to strengthen the party further for the next general elections,” he said. In the 2014 elections, the TRS had bagged 10, MIM 16, the Congress 16, BJP 6 and independents 2. Taking the support of AIMIM, TRS candidate Akula Sujatha won the mayoral post. This time, she lost in the election. The AIMIM’s Nizamabad district president Fayeem also lost in the polls.

The BJP did not win any municipality in erstwhile Nizamabad, Karimnagar and Adilabad, though BJP MPs got elected from the constituencies in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. Results of the Karimnagar municipal corporation will be out on January 27 when counting will be taken up. In Adilabad municipality, the BJP won from 11 wards, while TRS got 24 and Congress 5. The MIM also got 5 and others got four. It is clear even here the TRS will gets its chairperson elected.

The run-up to the polls, especially in Nizamabad and Karimnagar was a vitriolic campaign by parties. BJP MPs charged the police with taking the side of the ruling TRS party. The TRS criticised BJP MPs for allegedly raking up communal issues to secure votes.

Hyderabad: Counting at Boduppal Municipal Corporation’s counting centre in Maa Gardens began after a delay of almost two-and-a-half-hours on Saturday morning. Even as serious allegations were levelled against election officials for the delay, candidates, party workers and journalists were kept in the dark despite several requests seeking explanations.

“We have been waiting for the counting to begin for the past two hours,” said Ramana Reddy, an Independent candidate (Ward 19). “The ballot boxes were brought from the strong room, and they were opened by 8am, but they did not start counting them till 10.45am. I think it is due to lack of proper arrangement, but there was no word from the counting officials about why there was a delay,” Reddy said

Mild tension prevailed outside the centre after party workers and journalists demanded an explanation. Journalists waiting outside the centre sat on a protest and raised slogans against the authorities for restricting entry into the counting centre and refusing to give an explanation for the delay.

A few party workers, who were waiting patiently for the results outside the barricades installed about 200 metres from the counting centre, suspected foul play in the delay. “How can it be that the counting for the remaining 119 municipalities and nine corporations in Telangana began at 8am and not here,” said Raghu Yadav, a party worker. “We understand if there is a delay of half an hour or an hour, but this is not acceptable. It is all part of the plan.”

However, when contacted, an official overseeing the arrangements at the counting centre said: “The delay is because the officials have decided to stack the votes and separate them according to the wards before they start counting. Other counting centres have started counting the votes directly without separating them. This is time consuming, but they are doing this to avoid any confusion.”

Hyderabad: Independents and candidates of other parties such as the All India Forward Bloc have become crucial in order to secure chairperson and mayor posts across urban local bodies in Telangana. A majority of these independents are said to be TRS rebels and the ruling party immediately began their efforts to bring them back to the party.

This, as voters threw a hung verdict in Ramagundam, Meerpet, Badangpet and Nizamabad municipal corporations and in municipalities including Nereducherla, Bhongir, Jangaon, Yadagirigutta, Manikonda, Narsingi, Bhootpur, Amarchinta, Kalwakurthy Chityal and Nalgonda among others.

The hung verdict has also raised curtains on camp politics and alleged horse-trading. Neither the TRS nor Congress nor BJP have got a clear majority in these urban local bodies.

The ruling TRS was swift to shift several independents to an undisclosed location. Meanwhile, the Congress lodged a complaint with the state election commission against the TRS for allegedly indulging in camp politics and confining elected independent ward members. The Congress also complained that even the police had taken in several independents from the wards that got hung verdict.

On the other hand, Congress and BJP are taking measures to safeguard their respective elected ward members from hung urban local bodies from being contacted by other political parties particularly the ruling party.

Though the ruling TRS has an advantage of having nearly over 140 ex-officio members in the form of MPs, MLCs, MLAs who would have the voting right to elect mayors and chairpersons in the urban local body they opt for, it is not taking chances and is getting in touch with party rebels who won and other independents too.

The elections to the post of mayor and chairpersons is on January 27. In all 225 independents won and another 48 candidates from other political parties such as Forward Bloc, CPI, CPM, TJS won some of the municipal wards.

In Kollapur municipality, Forward Bloc party candidates won more seats than the ruling TRS. These candidates are said be TRS rebels and belong to former minister Jupalli Krishna Rao’s group.

Nashik: Participating in elections form the base of democracy, hence, it is the duty of all eligible voters to register their names on the electoral roll , said Rajaram Mane, the divisional commissioner of Nashik.

Mane made the comments on Saturday, at an event organised at the collectorate to mark the National Voters’ Day. Those present included Nashik district collector Suraj Mandhare; deputy commissioner Dileep Swami; additional district collector Nilesh Sagar; assistant district collector Kumar Ashirwad; deputy district election officer Kundan Sonawane; sub-divisional officer Nilesh Shringi; tahsildar Prashant Patil; and brand ambassador for voters with disabilities Jayshree Toche.

District collector Mandhare said voters should have a positive approach towards the democratic process as this, in turn, would lead to qualitative change in the country. He added that booth level officers (BLOs) and NGOs play a pivotal part in the process.

Deputy commissioner Dilip Swami said voter participation is key because in a democracy, it’s the government that comes to the people asking them to halp elect representatives.

Students from various schools performed a skit to mark the day in an appeal to people enroll their names in the voters’ rolls.

The administration also presented voter ID cards to newly registered voters. Children who were part of essay writing and drawing competitions on the election process were felicitated by authorities at the event.

Open heart surgery is a common treatment for such a case. But attendants hesitated to go ahead with the procedure considering the post-operative care risks.

257,['26/01/2020'],"Green roar of delight: CM taking side of tigers, forests welcomed","This story is from January 26, 2020

Nagpur: Greens are gaga over chief minister Uddhav Thackeray openly coming out in support of tigers and forests. On Friday, while shooting down a proposal for Human dam in Chandrapur district, he made it clear that irrigation projects cannot hamper wildlife corridors.

The dam was to be constructed 3.5km from Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve. It would have resulted in the diversion of 1.950 hectare dense forest and the felling of 1.50 lakh trees.

“To rise above vote bank politics and look at a brighter future for our planet, which we tend to overlook for short term gains, is to be applauded no end. I’m so happy that Uddhavji has taken a stand and lived up to our expectations. I hope all leaders can take inspiration from this and save the people from the environmental disaster we seem to be running towards. This should set a precedent keeping environment above politics and party lines. It is also important to revisit previously built projects, executed without much emphasis on environment and correct them with mitigation measures,” said actor Randeep Hooda.

Deepak Apte, director, Bombay Natural History Society said that it was heartening to see “CM taking firm stand” on one of the most “critical conservation issues”. “The Human dam would have caused irreversible damage to the wildlife corridor between Tadoba and other Central Indian tiger landscape,” he said.

Congratulating the CM, Apte said, “He also has ensured that water requirement needs are addressed by finding an alternate site. There are opportunities to create such win-win situation models, efforts must be taken for the same.”

Nitin Desai, director of Wildlife Protection Society of India Central India, was delighted that top political bosses are taking the side of tigers. “Chandrapur is already facing a space crunch for tigers. Given the non-committal approach of the irrigation department about either shifting the project upstream or adhering to mitigation measures suggested by NTCA, the CM directing authorities to revisit the proposal is wonderful news. Hope this spirit gets applied in other projects as well where wildlife generally ends up paying the price of development,” he said.

Wildlife photographer Sarosh Lodhi said, “When an elected representative gives more weight to saving environment, one knows that our forests and its animals are in the right hands.” This move will not only save our tigers in the proposed landscape but will also set the course for all other linear development projects that may bring harm to forests.”

“Special thanks to CM for a clear vision about environmental responsibility,” said conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar.

According to him, this is the first time government has shown sensibility towards forest and tiger protection. “Every other project going to state wildlife board (SWBL) is cleared or kept pending if politicians do not want it. The proposal for Kanhargaon sanctuary in Chandrapur is a classic example,” said Bhamburkar.

Dr Jerryl Banait, who has PILs for wildlife protection, welcomed the CM decision. “If the project is shifted upstream, the dam can also come up and dispersing Tadoba tigers can also be saved. Thackeray has taken a very sensitive stand,” he said.

CM TO TOI

While considering irrigation projects and other proposals near forest areas, we need to also look into it that such projects do not prove hurdle to corridors. Development is a must but it should not be at the cost of environmental damage. Irrigation officials need to study if the project can be shifted 5km upstream

BENGALURU: The desire to date young girls proved costly for a 47-year-old senior software developer , who lost Rs 4 lakh to an organised dating scam .

Nishant (name changed) has approached Bommanahalli police for help. His tryst with the racketeers began on December 20 last year when he received a message on his mobile from what claimed to be a global dating web service , which claimed to have a database of young women who were willing to date.

Nishant said he called the number mentioned in the SMS out of curiosity and spoke to a person who introduced herself as Payal. She told him he must register by paying Rs 2,000 to continue using the dating service. “I initially gave some money, after which they started sending photos of the women on WhatsApp claiming they were in Bengaluru and I could meet them,” Nishant said.

They continued to demand money for various reasons over the next 10 days. The scamsters would send him photos of a woman and tell him he could meet her in the next one hour if he transferred the amount. “Every time, they would set a deadline and ask me to transfer money for various reasons like booking a hotel to meet the woman, get medical certificate clearance and what not. For 11 days, I transferred money at least three or four times every day through e-wallets and online banking,” he added.

On 31 December 2019, when they demanded Rs 1 lakh, Nishant realised he’d been taken for a ride. By then, he had ended up paying Rs 4.2 lakh. “I approached police as there could be many who would’ve been robbed of their money by such dating sites,” he said.

TIRUPATI: A family drama across countries unfolded in Railway Kodur, in Kadapa district, on Saturday when a youth born to a Pakistani father and Indian mother pleaded with the police to allow him to stay in India with his mother.

Railway Kodur police said Sheik Noora, a local resident, had relocated to Kuwait in search of employment 22 years ago. While in Kuwait, she got married to Pakistani national Jaffer Sahid in 1997. The couple gave birth to a son , Valid Jaffer, in Kuwait. A year ago, Jaffer Sahid deserted Noora and moved back to Pakistan with his son, while the woman returned to her hometown Railway Kodur.

Noora later learnt that Valid was unhappy living with his father in Pakistan and decided to meet her son. On January 17, Valid arrived in India on a tourist visa and was reunited with his mother. On learning that a visitor from Pakistan was staying in the town, local police summoned Valid and his family to the police station as part of a routine enquiry.

262,['26/01/2020'],Cong top leaders wanted NIT’s dissolution: Fadnavis,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Nagpur: Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has jumped into the battle as the BJP attempts to thwart Congress minister Nitin Raut’s bid to revive the ‘dissolved’ Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT).

Fadnavis claimed that Raut was going against his party’s national leadership by not sticking to his government’s decision to dissolve NIT. “The top leadership had written a letter to the then chief minister Sushilkumar Shinde seeking scrapping of NIT. According to them existence of NIT was against the principles of 74th constitutional amendment which was done by Rajiv Gandhi government. The amendment aimed to make urban local bodies more powerful. He should not insult his party leaders and change his stand,” said the BJP leader.

Mayor Sandip Joshi has convened a general body meeting on Monday to pass a resolution against guardian minister Raut’s proposal to strengthen NIT. The guardian minister has reacted saying the state government will not be affected and will take its own decision.

Fadnavis, now the leader of opposition, said that the Congress-NCP did not dissolve NIT for over ten years when it was in power. “Finally it was the BJP government, which took steps in this direction. I fail to understand Congress leaders’ love for NIT,” he added.

On Friday, he had told TOI that no city in India except Nagpur had two civic authorities having same area of jurisdiction. “Nagpur has suffered due to conflict of jurisdiction. It would not be advisable to do it again,” he had said.

Fadnavis had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court a few years ago and had annexed the Congress high command letter with it. Another activist Anil Wadpalliwar, who too had filed a PIL against NIT, confirmed the existence of the letter. “I too had submitted the letter to the HC,” he said demanding dissolution of NIT.

Former state home minister Shrikant Jichkar had lobbied with the Congress-ruled state government in 1994 to abolish NIT. In 2002 he had written an open letter to media on his views.

City BJP leaders are now keen to produce this letter in the general body meeting to corner Congress. The opposition in NMC is yet to decide on its stand.

Congress corporators had demanded NIT’s abolition several times in the past. Now they will find it difficult to support Raut’s proposal. The letter if produced by BJP will make their position even more difficult.

NIT would have not been in existence today had the Fadnavis government not dilly-dallied on the issue. He decided to scrap the agency in December 2016, over two years after coming to power. A committee was formed to oversee transfer of NIT property to NMC by December 31, 2017. As the committee comprising an IAS officer did little to achieve the objective, the date for dissolution had to be postponed.

At the fag end of his tenure, Fadnavis cabinet again cleared dissolution of NIT and urban development department (UDD) issued a preliminary notification in this regard. However, assembly elections were announced before the final notification could be issued.

264,['26/01/2020'],"From heart attack to infertility, noise pollution is silent killer","This story is from January 26, 2020

Nagpur: Bursting the myth that noise pollution only causes hearing trouble, city experts warn that high decibels can have an adverse impact on the human heart, psychology, digestive system and fertility.

The latest research done by scientists at the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) reveals that noise levels exceed permissible standards of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) all across the city.

TOI took expert opinions to know the impact of increasing noise pollution on public health. While adverse effect on hearing due to high decibels is quite known, medical experts highlighted the lesser-known health damages.

Stating that noise pollution is a “silent killer” and a public health crisis, noted ENT surgeon Dr Madan Kapre highlighted its multiple health impacts. “The least understood of them is noise-induced anxiety states which include tachycardia, blood pressure, sweating and restlessness. All increase with exposure to noise,” he said.

Honking also leads to fatal accidents, added Kapre. “Loud honking often causes startle reflex, due to which motorists lose control over vehicle. At Narendra Nagar bridge in Nagpur, a mother and a child met with a fatal accident due to this,” said Kapre.

Latest studies show that exposure to high pollution also results in infertility. “Not many are aware that high decibels lead to impotency and also miscarriage. It is also responsible for increased stress levels, anxiety disorder, acidity, ulcers and indigestion,” said ENT surgeon Dr Naresh Agrawal.

According to both the experts, lack of concentration is also an outcome of noise pollution. “A study conducted in local schools had revealed that index of learning is higher in schools which witness less noise pollution,” said Dr Kapre.

People living in railway tracks and crowded areas are more vulnerable to hearing problems. “Tinnitus (ringing in ears) is a common problem faced by those living near railway tracks,” said Dr Agrawal.

Citing another study carried out in Central Avenue Road, Dr Kapre said, “Shopkeepers based in congested areas are victims of noise-induced deafness.

265,['26/01/2020'],State plans to allow establishments to run at night in Pune &amp; Nagpur too: Deshmukh,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Anil Deshmukh

Nagpur: After Mumbai, the Maharashtra government plans to allow commercial establishments like malls to run throughout night in two more cities of Pune and Nagpur, home minister Anil Deshmukh said.

While interacting with TOI on Saturday, he said that the government would study the response in Mumbai and then implement the same pattern in next two phases, first in Pune and then in Nagpur.

Later during his media interaction, he spoke on several issues including many contentious ones facing the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. He said the government has sought legal opinion on National Investigation Agency’s (NIA) move to take over Koregaon-Bhima violence probe and then decide on the future course of action.

“Ideally they (Union Home Ministry) should have taken the state’s consent. Their move is completely unconstitutional. States like West Bengal and Chhattisgarh had also opposed the NIA’s move earlier. They (BJP) may want to protect their men, who were part of the conspiracy,” he said, adding that the probe against Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote was underway.

Stating that he had been receiving many representations from the NGOs and common people against implementation of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register for Citizens (NRC), Deshmukh asserted that NCP and Congress fully endorsed their views.

“We’re yet to talk to our third partner. Based on the consensus, we will take a decision to pass the resolution on the lines of Kerala and Punjab. Even if Congress leader Kapil Sibal had stated that the states are bound to implementation the Act, what if they’re unwilling to cooperate. Over 1,250 protests have taken place including in Nagpur.”

Explaining MVA’s stand on the mysterious death of judge HD Loya, the minister said he had received many complaints from the NGOs and individuals that they were possessing many proofs. “However, no one approached me till date. Even as the Supreme Court had prohibited hearing of any cases on the incident, we can always explore if new evidence comes across.”

Replying on whether the government would handover the probe of multi-crore irrigation scam to other agency from Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) following the demand by the petitioner Janmanch, the five-time minister said ACB was doing its job properly. “You should ask the chief minister of 72 hours-old government who had himself appointed the agency and recently endorsed its stand.”

Deliberating on threats faced by the government, he said the biggest one comes from the over 2.5 lakh unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) drones, which were unregistered till date, and from cyber-criminals. “You must have watched how the Iranian General Qassem Soleimani was killed by the US forces with the help of drones. In the past, UAVs are used against attacking Venezuela president and others. They’re having 10-20 kms range and have good payload capacity. With advancement in the technology, we need to think ahead of the enemy’s sinister plans to prevent the deadly attacks like 1993 bomb blasts and 2008 terror strike in Mumbai and 2002 Parliament attack,” he said.

Reiterating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the police functioning, the minister cited Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde’s words of how it had helped the judiciary to read the thousands of documents while delivering key verdicts like on Ayodhya’s Ram Mandir. Agreeing with the concerns that prisons had become overcrowded, Deshmukh said those should be shifted outside the cities and expanded to accommodate the ever increasing number of inmates and those vacant places should be utilized for good projects.

266,['26/01/2020'],NIA taking over Elgar case has complicated matters: Tushar,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Tushar Kanti Bhattacharya, husband of Nagpur University professor Shoma Sen

Nagpur: “The wait has only got longer now,” says the weary 64-year old Tushar Kanti Bhattacharya after the National Investigation Agency on Friday took over investigations in the Elgar Parishad case in which his wife Shoma Sen has been jailed for 19 months.

Nagpur University professor Sen is among the three from Nagpur and one of the nine arrested in the case registered in Pune last year. The decision comes a couple of days before the bail plea in the charges framed by the state police is to be heard in Pune.

“It is slated for January 27. I plan to travel and also meet her. However, things have further complicated now,” says Bhattacharya.

Saying that the accused in Elgar Parishad case have now become a victim of political tug of war, Bhattacharya said, “Sharad Pawar had pressed for a special investigation team probe into the police action. Within a day, the case was transferred to NIA by the Centre. Those arrested in the case are suffering due to the political oneupmanship.”

The Pune police’s case was that inflammatory speeches at the December 31, 2017 Elgar Parishad led to violence in Koregaon Bhima the next day.

Relatives of those jailed are going through a lot of physical and emotional trauma. “Some days ago my blood pressure shot up. Travelling to Pune for the hearings leaves us weary,” says Bhattacharya.

Bhattacharya says subsistence has become difficult after his wife’s arrest. “Shoma was suspended by the university after her arrest. She retired from service while still in jail.

The university has not released her pension, according to Bhattacharya. “I have been requesting university officials to start it. Strangely, a communication from the higher education department refers to Shoma as suspended-retired employee. How can a retired employee be suspended as well,” he asks.

Bhattacharya said that five months ago the joint director of higher education asked director for a clarification if provisional pension could be released during pendency of a case. “Early this month, the director’s office told me that a reply will be sent within 15 days. Its been three weeks now,” he says.

Sen’s daughter Koel, who resides in Mumbai, said that Shoma is in “solitary confinement”. “No mattress has been provided to her and she has used two blankets instead. The light remains switched on throughout the night, she has got accustomed to it,” she says.

Koel too finds courts visits “distressing”. “On some occasions we are not even allowed to talk, on others the authorities are very generous,” she says.

Nashik: The footfall of tourists has been increasing from the past five years and there is a huge potential in the city, said the president of the Travel Agents Association of Nashik (TAAN).

A delegation from TAAN will soon meet the state tourism minister Aditya Thackeray and discuss what needs to be done to further promote tourism in the city.

Speaking during the three-day tourism expo, which started on Friday, Rajendra Bakre said that the association has plans to develop Nashik as a tourism hub. “The tourism expo is a part of promotion and branding of the city to attract tourists,” he said.

He said that the association would like to capitalise on the increasing number of tourists in the city. “Nashik is not only a religious city, but it is also known for its pleasant climate. It has also emerged as the wine capital of the country and there are over 100 trekking sites in the district. Nashik is one of the four cities in the country where Kumbh Mela is held after every four years,” Bakre said.

He felt that government support is also equally important for the city to become a tourism hub. “There is a huge tourism potential and it needs a lot of branding and marketing of the city. We have already been making efforts to promote Nashik as a tourism hub. But efforts are needed from the government also, said Bakre.

Meanwhile, the tourism expo was inaugurated by the DCP Laxmikant Patil on Friday.

Over 50 travel companies put up their stalls presenting various tour options right from the USA, Europe to various domestic destinations.

TAAN has been conducting exhibitions every year, a month before the summer season begins. This is the 15th tourism expo being held in the city. “Early bookings help us get hotel rooms at lower rates and the benefits are passed on to tourists. Hence, they may get tour packages at reasonable rates,” added Bakre.

The travel companies, which participated in the expo were The Departures, Khanvel Resort, Nidhi Tours, Thomas Cook Ltd, Sukhmani Tours & Travels, Magic Mountain, Prasanna Holidays, Konkan Paryatan Vikas Sanstha, Tulip Holidays etc.

Representative image

PATNA: Notorious liquor smuggler Baiju Mahto was killed in a police encounter in Vaishali district in the wee hours of Saturday. Baiju’s close aide Ashutosh Kumar, a resident of Premnagar under Lalganj police station in Vaishali district, was arrested.

Vaishali SP Gaurav Mangla said two pistols, three live and three empty cartridges and an SUV were seized from the spot. At least nine cases under Excise and Prohibition Act 2016 were lodged against Baiju with the Lalganj police station alone. Besides, other cases related to extortion, loot and murder were pending at Patepur, Bhagwanganj and Mahua police stations in the district. He was a resident of Pakri village in Vaishali district.

The encounter took place barely a few hours after state DGP Gupteshwar Pandey, in a review meeting at the Vaishali district headquarters on Friday, warned the “lax” and “lazy” police officers of stern disciplinary action.

Police said Baiju (40) along with his two associates opened fire on a police team which tried to intercept an SUV near Tinpulwa turning under Lalganj police station around 1am on Saturday. Lalganj SHO Sunil Kumar, who was leading the police team, had a narrow escape in the firing. The police returned the fire causing injuries to Baiju. He was rushed to Lalganj referral hospital from where doctors referred him to Hajipur Sadar hospital. However, he succumbed to his injuries on way to Hajipur. While one of Baiju’s associates managed to escape under the cover of darkness, his close aide Ashutosh Kumar from Premnagar in Vaishali district was arrested.

SP Mangla said that raids were on to nab the criminal, who had managed to escape. Police sources said Baiju was also involved in the attack on a former SHO of Lalganj police station about four years ago. Sources said Vaishali, of late, has turned into a safe zone for bootleggers.

This is perhaps the first occasion when a liquor smuggler had been killed in a police encounter in the state this year. Earlier, a suspected liquor smuggler, Munna, was killed in a police encounter under Barsoi police station in Katihar district in February 2018.

Munna’s killing had led to wide protest by the victim’s relatives and some local residents. The mob had vandalized the Barsoi police station. Munna was killed while sneaking into Katihar district from Raiganj in West Bengal on February 14, 2018.

The state was declared dry on April 4, 2016 under Bihar Excise and Prohibition Act. Under the law, manufacture, sale and consumption of liquor is banned in the state.

Pravin Datke being felicitated

Nagpur: Pravin Datke has been appointed as the city BJP president for three years while Arvind Gajbhiye is the new district president. Datke was the interim president since June 2019. BJP has also appointed new assembly constituency unit presidents in the city. The six assembly constituency unit presidents of Nagpur rural will be appointed next week.

The party has tried to give representation to all castes. Gajbhiye is a Dalit while his predecessor Rajiv Poddar was a Brahmin. Dalits feel under-represented in BJP and Gajbhiye has been given the charge to woo the community. The party had performed badly in the rural areas of the district in the recent assembly elections, winning only two out of six seats. Poddar himself had lost badly from Saoner. Gajbhiye was the general secretary of the district unit.

The six assembly unit presidents of the city are Vinod Kanhere (Nagpur West), Devendra Dasture (Nagpur South), Sanjay Chaudhari (Nagpur North), Kishor Palandurkar (Nagpur Central), Kishor Wankhede (Nagpur South-West) and Sanjay Awchat (Nagpur East). One is a Brahmin, three are Kunbis, one is a Kalar and one a Teli. Datke is an OBC belonging to the Barai community.

Significantly, BJP has not appointed a Dalit as the in-charge of Nagpur North unit. The constituency is reserved for SCs and has a large Dalit population. The new chief Chaudhari is a Kunbi.

While Datke’s election was a foregone conclusion, several persons were in the race for the district president’s post. They were Hingna MLA Sameer Meghe, Kamptee MLA Tekchand Sawarkar, former MLA Sudhir Parwe, senior leader Anandrao Raut and Gajbhiye.

Sources in BJP said that Gajbhiye’s name was finalized by Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and former guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule on Friday night. The formal announcement of the new presidents was made at a party function held at Geeta Mandir, Subhash Road.

PANAJI: The military doctor couple who lost their four-and-a-half-year-old son in 2017, when he fell from their sixth-floor home due to a faulty grill in the naval officer’s colony in Dabolim, has received compensation of Rs 1.3 crore from NKG Infrastructure Ltd. The amount was paid by NKG infrastructure Ltd ( Panaji ) and Pradeep Kumar Garg on Wednesday, via demand draft.

The Vasco police have filed a chargesheet against all accused persons except the project manager of the Married Accomodation Project (MAP). Vasco PI informed the high court that a sanction was required from the ministry of defence. The ministry of defence took a decision not to grant sanction to prosecute the project manager, MAP before the courts under the Code of Criminal Procedure, but instead, to proceed under the Army Act, 1950.

Standing counsel for the central government representing the director general and project manager, MAP, stated that disciplinary proceedings have commenced against the errant officers, and pointed out that a tentative chargesheet has already been placed, and three hearings have taken place in the matter.

“Proceedings have to be expedited in a manner of this nature, so that justice is done to all parties involved,” stated the order passed by justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar.

The child, Atharva Taralkar was playing near the window on the sixth floor of the flat at NOFRA-E, Dabolim, when the grill installed on the window dislodged and fell out, causing him to fall and succumb to his injuries in 2017.

His parents, Lt-Colonel Narendra Taralkar and Surgeon Lieutenant Trishna Taralkar , donated their son’s corneas.

Nagpur: Speaker Nana Patole has organized meetings on Monday in Mumbai to discuss two issues which were left undecided by the BJP-ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Devendra Fadnavis-led state government. The issues have financial implications on the cash-strapped NMC and may further escalate the growing tension between the BJP and Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.

Patole wants to discuss 7th Pay Commission salary for NMC employees as well as the instalment for builders in building plan charges above Rs1 crore. Urban development minister Eknath Shinde and officials from urban development, finance and other departments are expected to attend the meetings.

The urban development department has asked the NMC chief to be present. No invitation has been issued for mayor Sandip Joshi, standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane or any other office bearer. As the new civic chief is yet to take charge and with Joshi calling an urgent general body meeting on Monday, the heads of town planning and finance departments are likely to go to Mumbai.

The office bearers of NMC’s only recognized union — Rashtriya Nagpur Corporation Employees Association — have been invited for the meeting. The association is led by the Congress and a delegation had discussed the 7th pay commission status with Patole, guardian minister Nitin Raut and Shinde earlier.

Union president Surendra Tingane told TOI that NMC employees were not given salary as per 7th Pay Commission as the previous government delayed its implementation. “The general body passed a resolution to implement it with effect from August 2019. The proposal is pending with the state government,” he said.

Tingane said the union will seek directives for arrears of 6th Pay Commission and 7th Pay Commission to be paid. “The 6th Pay Commission arrears from January 1, 2006 to November 30, 2010 is pending. NMC gave some amount in three instalments. Also, arrears of 7th Pay Commission from January 1, 2016 is pending,” he said.

The BJP-ruled NMC had declined to give arrears of both pay commissions due to the financial crisis. It would have incurred an additional burden of Rs20 crore per month.

The second issue of making provision for instalment in paying building plan charges of over Rs1 crore is pending at the NMC level. CREDAI is pressing for the demand since a year.

During the tenure of Virendra Kukreja, the standing committee had approved the provision in February 2019. Since then, the proposal is pending and yet to come before the general body.

If approved, the NMC will not get bulk amount from town planning department at one go.

For last few days, differences have cropped up between MVA government and BJP over formation of committee on Nag River Pollution Abatement Project and Raut’s plan to retain NIT’s planning authority status of Gunthewari areas.

Though elected from Sakoli in Bhandara district, Patole is a resident of the Nagpur from where he had lost the last Lok Sabha elections.

Governor Satya Pal Malik felicitates North Goa collector R Menaka at the National Voter’s Day function held at... Read More

PANAJI: Despite improvements in the electoral process over the years, caste and money politics continue to play a major role in elections in the country, Goa Governor Satya Pal Malik said on Saturday.

“It (caste politics) is not visible but irrespective of the party, candidates are fielded on the basis of caste,” he said during the National Voter’s Day function at Kala Academy.

“Caste-based politics is a terrible thing and nothing else can stand in comparison to this. I have seen the trend broken only on two or three occasions. Once was in the elections after Indira Gandhi’s death, when it was broken due to the wave of nationalism that took over. The second was when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power. Nationalism broke this trend again,” Malik said, adding that it was difficult to put an end to caste politics.

‘Money power’ too is a big factor in elections, he said, adding that candidates spend up to Rs 1 crore to sway voters. “This is destroying the sanctity of the election process,” he said.

Malik credited former chief election commissioner T N Seshan for streamlining the electoral process by introducing central paramilitary forces for security, instead of local police during elections which helped put an end to booth-capturing, and added that the issue of people voting twice – at their place of work and their native village- has also been streamlined. Despite this, caste and money politics continues, he said.

“There’s no bigger empowerment than the vote,” he said, urging people to use their right wisely, and shame those who don’t.

He criticised the highly-educated in Mumbai who fail to exercise their franchise to vote, pointing out that it always records a low voting percentage.

“This is not the case in Goa, where the voting percentage is healthy,” he said.

Nagpur: Miffed at the constant failure of the detection branch units in solving cases, including prevention of a robbery at Gopalkrishna Nagar on Saturday by three goons, the top brass of the Nagpur police took a decision to attach around three dozens of cops and officers of the detection branch unit of Sakkardara, Nandanvan and Hudkeshwar police stations to headquarters.

But, following the intervention of Zonal DCP Nirmala Devi S, they got two days’ respite. Now they have either to nab the three involved in the robbery or be ready to get replaced and sit at the headquarters.

The cops from Sakkardara, Wathoda, Nandanvan and Hudkeshwar police stations have not only failed to generate any inputs regarding the suspects but also failed to prevent the latest incident of Gopalkrishna Nagar despite all plans were in place and briefings done.

City police chief B K Upadhyay deployed seven police stations of Zone IV in the east and southern part of the city under DCP Nirmala between 4am and 7am. “We had already issued the order of their transfers but decided to defer the implemtntaion on the request of the DCP Nirmala for two days,” the CP said.

The city police have requested the NMC to keep street lights on till 6.30amas they are having difficulties in spotting suspects and vehicles in the CCTV cameras.

The Gopalkrishna Nagar robbery where Bebitai Urkunde, 50, was threatened with knife by the three robbers at 5.47am on Saturday was the fourth such kind of armed robbery. The three robbers fled with gold chain of Urkunde, worth Rs 12,000, after injuring her.

Cops spotted the trio on a bike at 5.30am but a miscalculation by an officer proved costly. While he directed colleagues to rush to Dighori naka, the goons took the Dighori bridge before sneaking into a lane and within minutes fled after robbing Urkunde.

Victim Harish Patel

Nagpur: The family of a 32-year-old man, Harish Patel, woke up on Saturday to the horror of seeing his body in a pool of blood just opposite their house. Patel was found murdered in front of his house at Kachipura with several injuries of sharp weapons on his body and head smashed with heavy stone.

Patel, who had murdered one Yogesh Patta around a decade ago, had got settled with family after inheriting father’s business of food stalls near Shankar Nagar garden. He still had considerable domination in the locality. Police are still groping in dark about the motive and suspects behind the murder.

A neighbour and a kin, however, are learnt to be under police scanner. According to police, Patel suspected his wife’s close relation with a relative whom he had thrashed around a year ago. The relative had earned the ire of Patel after he had gone to see off his wife at Rewa in Madhya Pradesh against his wish. Patel had been nurturing hatred for the relative who was rounded up by crime branch for questioning after the murder.

Patel’s son Sujal said he had called up his father at midnight who said he might not come home. “Though father had said that he was not returning, still I went around trying to locate him at the eateries and bars but could not trace him. Later, I had gone to sleep,” he said.

It’s learnt Patel had a habit of consuming liquor daily with friends. On the evening before his murder, he had gone out with three of his friends in an auto-rickshaw for having liquor at Sitabuldi.

One of the friends, who was with Patel, said that he had left him near his house at 2am. “After dropping a friend near Chunabhatti, we had returned to Kachipura. Later, I had gone back home,” he said.

The mystery behind Patel’s murder has so far kept the cops on tenterhooks and family in the dark. Patel’s son Sujal said that he had named some suspects before police with whom his father either had a fight or quarrel in the past including a DJ player who was supposed to repay some money he had borrowed.

Bajaj Nagar police have registered an offence against unidentified persons. Police said around four persons are likely to be involved. “Cops have already quizzing some suspects but yet to get any breakthrough,” said a senior officer.

278,['26/01/2020'],"Goa: Postal ballot for voters with disabilities, those over 80 years","This story is from January 26, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: In a move that is sure to bring relief to senior citizens and persons with disabilities (PwD), chief electoral officer Kunal has said that those above the age of 80 years and persons with physical disabilities will no longer have to go to the polling station to vote. Instead, they will be given the option of voting via postal ballot.

“A notification has recently been issued by the Commission of India by virtue of which senior citizens (above 80 years) and those with physical disabilities can be granted postal ballots if they request for it,” Kunal said. He was speaking recently at the national voter’s day programme held at Kala Academy, Panaji . This, Kunal said, is one of the most notable achievements as far as accessibility in the electoral process concerned.

In the 2019 general elections, wheelchairs were made available at every polling station in the state. “We were also successful in tagging 7,700 PwD voters in our electoral management system,” he said. Further he encouraged people to assist in tagging, saying this will help create more facilities for PwD voters.

Kunal also said that the elector’s verification programme has been carried out successfully throughout the state with cent percent results and that 19,000 entries have been found that required correction. There has only been a marginal increase in voters as compared to the last year, he said.

Chief secretary Parimal Rai said citizens should be proud as India is much ahead of even the likes of the US, where paper ballots are still used in elections. “This largest temple of democracy, this country of ours is far ahead of the rest,” Rai said, appealing to youngsters to register their names on the electoral rolls.

State election commissioner R K Srivastava said that besides being the largest democracy, India also has advanced electoral processes. “Many of our election related officials, including CEOs, are called upon by many other countries as independent election observers. This speaks volumes about the credibility we have achieved,” Srivastava said.

Election officials have also been engaged in training various election related officials abroad, he said.

File photo used for representational purpose

NEW DELHI: Next winter, use of diesel generator (DG) sets will not be allowed in Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh and Faridabad, Gurugram and Manesar in Haryana. This was decided in a meeting of the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority ( EPCA ) with the authorities of the NCR states.

“We won’t allow anyone to use diesel generator sets in industrial as well as residential areas. We need to work with the authorities and industries department to decide the plan of action to ensure the ban is implemented,” EPCA chief Bhure Lal said, adding that he will meet Haryana and UP power agencies on January 30 to discuss the issue.

During the recent EPCA meeting, it was also debated on whether solar energy or gas-based generators could be used instead of the polluting DG sets. “Why can’t these industries be asked to use solar? Come back with an action plan,” panel member Sunita Narain told the authorities of UP and Haryana.

Officials said that solar battery backup for this magnitude of power requirement was not available for want of enough storage capacity. Some Haryana societies were using gas-based generators but supply across the whole of NCR still remained an issue.

“Priority is to get people off generators,” Narain said.

The UP and Haryana power authorities also submitted to the SC-appointed panel the current status of DG sets in the major towns and the action being taken by them. 2019 was the first time that a blanket ban on diesel generators had been announced in Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Faridabad, Gurugram, Sonipat, Panipat and Bahadurgarh, apart from Delhi, during the winter pollution cycle. In the previous years, areas outside Delhi were exempted from the ban, which was first implemented in 2017, on account of poor power supply infrastructure.

Only gensets used for emergency and essential services, such as hospitals, and metro stations, are excluded from the ban. However, due to erratic power supply and lack of connection in some areas, it couldn’t be implemented in the NCR towns.

Many residential colonies and commercial establishments in NCR were given occupancy certificates without connecting them to the regular power supply.

Nagpur: The Nagpur city traffic police on Saturday penalized 21 two-wheeler riders — most of them youngsters — for driving on the wrong side and modifying silencers of their vehicles.

Led by deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Chinmay Pandit, traffic police personnel undertook the drive in and around Futala lake where motorists, especially two-wheeler riders, indulge in hooliganism every year in the run up to, and on Republic Day .

Pandit appealed to Nagpurians to not indulge in rash and negligent driving during Republic Day celebrations. He said that those caught flouting traffic rules and causing traffic nuisance will face action under the relevant sections of Motor Vehicles Act. “We will also detain vehicles of such errant motorists,” warned senior police inspector Jayesh Bhandarkar.

Since January 16, the police have booked 216 people for using fancy number plates and have penalized 129 two-wheeler riders for modifying silencers of bikes.

dsdsd

Dehradun: Seers of Matri Sadan in Haridwar have expressed apprehension of a conspiracy by the state government to end the ongoing fast-unto-death by its woman seer Padmavati by using force and a possible attempt to kill her as well as the ashram chief Swami Shivanand Saraswati.

In an application given to Haridwar chief judicial magistrate (CJM) under CRPC’s section 39 clause 5, (which gives the public right to give information of certain offences), Brahmachari Dayanand of Matri Sadan claimed that two of its earlier seers – prof GD Agrawal and Swami Nigamanand – were “killed” in similar manners.

Haridwar SSP Senthil Abudai said, “As of now we are totally unaware of any such application from Matri Sadan to CJM. It would be inappropriate to comment on the matter without getting all details.”

Demanding the government act on its promises to clean and save the Ganga, 86-year-old IIT professor GD Agrawal, who was also a seer of Matri Sadan, had died on October 11, 2018, at AIIMS Rishikesh after fasting for 111 days. Swami Nigamanand, who went on a hunger strike on February 19, 2011 to save the river from pollution caused by illegal mining in the river bed, died on June 13 after fasting for 115 days. He was just 34.

At a press conference called at their ashram in Haridwar, Matri Sadan chief Swami Shivanand Saraswati said he had come to know of the plan through reliable sources.

Recently, Bihar water resource minister Sanjay Jha had also visited Matri Sadan showcasing support to woman seer Padmavati who hails from Bihar.

Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his intervention in meeting the demands of the seer “who is risking her life to save the Ganga”.

Padmavati, who hails from Nalanda district, has been fasting for 41 days.

Dehradun: Chief Information Commissioner Shatrughan Singh has slapped a fine of Rs 5,000 on Public Information Officer (PIO) of the Uttarakhand forest department for not providing information sought under the RTI Act by a Haridwar-based social activist.

The CIC had passed the order on January 22. Speaking to TOI, the activist, Vinod Jain, said, “Last year, I had submitted evidence of financial irregularities committed in the cactus garden at the Dehradun zoo. Following which, I filed an RTI seeking details of the investigation but the forest department did not reply to my RTI for a year.”

The project was launched in the zoo in 2018 and Jain alleged that no tenders were given for the work that was worth over Rs 50 lakh.

“Through an RTI, I first found the exact money spent on the entire project, including building and procurement of cacti by the forest department. As per the information, Rs 10.65 lakh was spent on building the shed for the cactus garden, Rs 16.64 lakh was spent on buying cactus and succulent plants for the projects while Rs 12 lakh was used in other related work,” Jain said.

He added that “it came as a big surprise that no tender was invited for all these works in the zoo.” “I submitted all evidence to the forest department along with my affidavit. However, when I filed the RTI to know the follow-up action, the forest department did not give any details.”

In the CIC hearing, the PIO submitted that on May 13, 2019, the RTI application was received and on June 12, 2019, he was informed that the investigation is underway and after completion of the investigation he would be informed about the outcome.

During the hearing, when the PIO was asked if he would furnish any document such as a postal stamp or receipt to buttress his claim that a reply was posted, the PIO admitted that he had no evidence. The CIC then passed the order of Rs 5,000 fine to the PIO and instructed to provide all the details related to the RTI to the applicant within a stipulated time.

Even after repeated attempts by TOI, the PIO and senior forest department officials didn’t comment on the CIC order and reason for not responding to Jain’s RTI.

PANAJI: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the state government to complete the process of identification of wetlands in the state by January 2021. Further, it has asked for a progress report to be submitted on a quarterly basis.

The state government had requested NGT for a one-year extension to identify the wetlands in the state.

Speaking to TOI, advocate general Devidas Pangam said, “NGT has given us a year to identify these wetlands.”

In an affidavit, the state government told NGT that work towards implementing the Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017, has already commenced and that various committees have been constituted under the Goa State Wetland Authority (GSWA). Further, the government said the process of compiling information pertaining to pre-existing rights involves interaction with the local people which includes owners, tenants and other stakeholders.

The government also said that it is pertinent to note that unlike in other states, in the dry season, most wetlands in the state are utilised for agriculture and are temporary wetlands which support the extant flora and fauna including migratory birds while the water is used for various purposes downstream. Hence, this facultative system is unique to Goa and requires considerable amount of time for preparation of brief document, stakeholder consultations, enlisting ecosystem services and finding pre-existing rights in a definitive manner, it said.

“Accordingly, a decision was taken to appoint CSIR-NIO to complete the identification of the wetlands on account of their credentials which are beyond any doubt of integrity and it was of bonafide belief and understanding of GSWA that the Rules permit appointment of expert authorities for identification of wetlands,” the government said

NGT had pulled up government authorities for “abdicating their responsibility” in identifying wetlands in the state and had questioned the rationale behind engaging NIO for the task. “We get the distinct impression that the regulatory authorities in the state like the wetland authority, biodiversity and environment department are abdicating their responsibilities,” NGT had said.

Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan

PALAKKAD: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that the state will implement a curriculum that is in tune with the times and guarantees employment and promotes entrepreneurship.

Inaugurating a super and mini version of fab labs and a startup incubator at Government Polytechnic College at Kanjikode on Saturday, the CM said: “We need to equip students with resources that enable them to meet global challenges of the new age. For that, they must get learning facilities of international standards and academic assignments of futuristic use.”

With this, the statewide networks of 20 fab labs were establishments that develop technical prototyping platforms for design fabrication technology.

Vijayan said that the Super Fab Lab he had opened with a remote will function at the Integrated Startup Complex (ISC) of the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) at Kalamassery is the world’s first such facility to function outside the US and is operated in collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

“It will give India’s hardware industry a huge leap by allowing researchers, innovators and developers to do things beyond the purview of the state’s existing fab labs,” the CM said.

Vijayan pointed out: “The startup ecosystem is making giant strides across continents and in Kerala we are making big progress in the field of electronic hardware.”

Presiding over the meeting, water resources minister K Krishnankutty said that ‘precision farming’ can be one of the new subjects that can be introduced into the syllabus on technology.

MEERUT: A three-member team for administering polio drops was allegedly thrashed and held hostage after local residents mistook them for the National Population Register (NPR) data collection team. The incident occurred at Lisari Gate locality on Saturday. However, two of them, including a staff nurse, managed to free themselves and complained to police.

Lisari Gate station officer Prashant Kapil said, “We have received the complaint from the medical team and we are in the process of filing an FIR against the culprits for stopping public servants from performing their duty. This is not the first time that such an incident has happened in the area.”

According to one of victims Kabir Ahmad Khan, who is an officer of the immunization programme, “The incident occurred in Lakhipura locality of Lisari Gate area where a family opposed the administration of polio drops. As per rule, we have to enter the name of the non-consenting parents in the tally (yellow) register. The moment we asked their names, there was a strong protest and within no time, we were surrounded by a mob. We tried to explain them the purpose of our visit. We even showed them the vaccine box and our IDs, but they didn't listen to us and even manhandled one of our team members. They tore away the register and the local women even held hostage a woman staffer in our team. Later, senior staff along with the WHO field monitors also reached the spot and again tried to explain things to them.”

Khan said, “The NPR-NRC anxiety among them is obviously the main issue because one of the youths in the mob even told people not to reveal any details to us because he suspected we were the NPR data collectors . Ever since this issue came up, we have been facing very tough resistance from the local residents. But this time, they turned violent.”

289,['26/01/2020'],NGT slams UP govt for ignoring its order to notify Sanctuary,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Meerut: A day after TOI reported the intervention of MoEF asking UP government to notify Hastinapur Sanctuary, National Green Tribunal has in a strong worded order reprimanded the state government for having ""not cared to comply with order of Tribunal despite of ample time having been given to them and they are still not taking steps for compliance of the order of the Tribunal.""

Though the order came in a hearing on Friday but it was uploaded on NGT website on Saturday morning.

The two-judge bench of Justice Raghuvendra Rathore and Satyender Singh Garbyal got irked by request of the respondents' counsel seeking more time to implement May 2019 order.

Reprimanding the state officials, it said, ""To our surprise, further time is being sought on behalf of the respondent to file reply to the execution application, what to say of filing the compliance report. It is clear case where officer of the State government has not cared to comply with order of Tribunal despite of ample time having been given to them.""

The court mentioned about the MeEF letter to state government asking for notification that TOI has covered.

""We have also been informed by the Counsel for MoEF&CC that they have also reminded the State Government for doing the needful i.e. to issue Notification under the Wildlife Protection Act"", the Tribunal observed.

Now Tribunal has given another 10 days time for compliance.

""In the aforesaid circumstances and in the interest of justice, 10 days time to respondents no. 6 and 7 ((Principal Secretary Forest and Wildlife and Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, UP Government) i.e. by 03.02.2020 for filing the status/compliance report, failing which respondents no. 6 and 7 shall remain present before the Tribunal on the next date of hearing.""

In 1986, the government had issued a primary notification declaring Hastinapur forest area a sanctuary. However, no final government order notifying the 2,073 square-km area a protected zone has come from the government since then. Irked over it, the NGT had last year in May asked the forest department to explain to it the reason behind over 30 years of delay in proclaiming Hastinapur wildlife area as a protected sanctuary.

It gave six months to follow the order. Then, on December 18 last year, the NGT issued contempt cum execution notices to Union Ministry of Environment and Forest, UP government and others over non-implementation of its earlier order.

Idols made of PoP and plastic are insoluble and form a layer like concrete on the waterbed, not allowing groun... Read More

NEW DELHI: With Saraswati Puja coming up on Wednesday, many city residents have a unique worry. Where to immerse the idols ?

Last year, city authorities had stopped immersion of idols in the Yamuna and created artificial ponds all over the city for eco-friendly visarjan. Saraswati Puja, which coincides with Basant Panchami, is popular in Bengal, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, and is performed for a single day, however, is held on a much smaller scale in the city and there is no such preparation for it.

PK Pal of East Bengal Displaced Persons (EBDP) Association, an umbrella body for residents of CR Park, said no arrangements have been made by any authorities for artificial ponds. “We will go to Kalindi Kunj as some ponds are there. However, many others will immerse the idols in the river. As it is a smaller festival, authorities took no initiative,” Pal said.

According to Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), no preparations have been done in terms of keeping vigil at city ghats or preparing artificial ponds for the upcoming festival. “However, devotees can immerse clay idols with natural, biodegradable paint. No plastic or plaster of Paris (PoP) idols are allowed,” a DPCC official said.

Idols made of PoP and plastic are insoluble and form a layer like concrete on the waterbed, not allowing groundwater to recharge.

“Pollution of waterbodies due to immersion of PoP idols is a matter of concern . In addition to silting, toxic chemicals used in making idols tend to leach out and pose serious problems,” he said.

In the last festive season in 2019, there were 116 artificial ponds for idol immersion during Ganesh Chaturthi and 89 artificial ponds for Durga Pooja, to avoid immersion in Yamuna. “Due to the non-immersion of idols in the Yamuna, the quality of river water showed an improvement,” said a Delhi government official.

According to the NGT-appointed Yamuna monitoring committee, neither any directions have been issued on this particular puja immersion nor did the green court have mentioned anything about it in its order. “On principle, people should not pollute the river. We will put in our forthcoming report that other than the Ganesh and Durga festivals there are many community-based events like Saraswati Puja. DMs and environment and forest department may be directed to see that the river isn’t allowed to be made a receptacle. All bridges should have receptacles for such itinerant puja material which should be disposed of in a way that satisfies the larger community and undertaken by NGOs,” an monitoring committee member said.

According to another expert, the authorities, from next year, should make arrangements in localities for smaller festivals, too, so that no immersion takes place in the river and like in Ganesh and Durga Puja people have options for eco-friendly visarjan.

Bijnor: Preparations for Ganga Yatra are in full swing here ahead of CM Yogi Adityanath’s visit on Monday, when he will flag off the journey. Bijnor is the first district in UP where the sacred river enters the state at Sabalgarh village. The yatra will end on January 31 in Kanpur.

Yogi will also address a public meeting at Ganga Barrage. A podium has being erected on the river bank. Experts are busy in preparing a helipad nearby where CM’s chopper will land. Initially, Yogi was to inaugurate the yatra at Sabalgarh village.

Meanwhile, all encroachers have been served notices to remove their stalls along the banks.

In a bid to clean up the river, the irrigation department has weeded out water hyacinths and dredged out all waste floating in the water. For a change, the river water appears to be crystal clear.

The banks have been decorated with paintings.

Hundreds of people are expected to participate in the programme. Tight security will be in place both on the ground and over the Ganga. Drones will be deployed to keep vigil. City’s superintendent of police Lakshmi Nivas Mishra said, “The entire area where the programme will be held will be cordoned off. No traffic will be allowed on Delhi Pauri national highway for one and a half hour while the CM is in the Barrage area.”

Around 22 additional SPs and circle officers, 50 SHOs, 300 sub-inspectors and 1,200 police and PAC personnel will be deployed in security zone. Additional force from districts in Bareilly zone have been called. Besides, fivc drones and 10 boats have been arranged to keep a vigil in the area, Mishra added.

According to district panchayat raj officer Satish Kumar, “State ministers, MPs and MLAs will spend the nights at villages during the five-day yatra and make villagers aware about the importance of this holy river. Besides development and sanitation schemes will be reviewed at these villages.”

Schools, anganwadi centres and panchayat buildings have been painted with slogans based on the Ganga and sanitation, Kumar added.

Bijnor district magistrate, Ramakant Pandey, on Friday, flagged off three LED vans to spread the message of Ganga Yatra in the district. These LED vans will also broadcast live Yogi’s programmes at different places.

Ganga passes through 26 districts in UP comprising 21 civic bodies and 1,026 village panchayats. It will end on January 31 in Kanpur.

292,['26/01/2020'],Facelift of choked Hapur road crossing caught in red tape,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Meerut: Hapur road, one of the most congested crossings in the city, will have to wait for its facelift as the project for beautification has been caught in an indefinite delay due to overlapping projects and lack of coordination between the government agencies, sources said.

A team of senior officials led by district magistrate Anil Dhingra, Meerut Development Authority (MDA) vice-chairman Rajesh Kumar Pandey and municipal commissioner Manoj Kumar had visited the spot in the last week of November, last year, and had claimed that the redesigning work will begin by first week of December.

But, it has been over two months past the stipulated time when the project was supposed to kickstart, but nothing happened on ground.

According to senior officials, the agency which is tasked with preparing the detailed project report had pegged the estimated cost of the project at Rs 5 crore which was earlier claimed to be 70 lakh when the project was mooted. “The agency which has prepared the report has estimated the project cost at Rs 5 crore. We are trying to curtail it,” MDA VC Pandey said.

Hapur road crossing is one of the areas in the city that witnesses maximum vehicular traffic. The heavy influx of vehicular traffic comes from Garh road, Hapur and several main arterial roads. The defunct traffic signals at the crossing add to the chaos as a handful of traffic constables try to hold the fort, especially during rush hours.

“Another reason of the delay is that the crossing also features in smart city project. The redesigning of crossing would have been done but the roads that lead to the crossing are not in good shape. Public work department has now taken up revamp of both roads and crossing,” MDA VC Pandey said, adding, “The project is ready and will soon get rid of all delays.”

One of the crocodiles basking in the sun near a pond in Bagderi village in Koraput district

KORAPUT: Villagers of Bagderi in Koraput’s Kundura block are living in fear as two crocodiles from the village pond have been venturing into the village in search of food for the past four days.

According to the villagers, the crocodiles move out of the pond between 1 pm and 2 pm and at night in search of food. Though the critters have not attacked any villager, people have blamed the forest department for not paying heed to their problem.

“On Wednesday, we sighted a crocodile ambling towards the village and informed the forest department,” said Arjun Nayak , a villager. Villagers spotted a crocodile dead near the pond on Thursday morning. “The reptile had probably died after being hit by some vehicle on Wednesday night. We are panicky now,” he added.

Villagers said children fear going to school because it is situated just 50 metres from the pond and the possibility of the crocodile venturing inside the school campus cannot be be ruled out. “Though we have informed the forest officials, little has been done to contain the crocodiles,” said Anant Majhi , another villager.

However, forest officials said the situation is being closely monitored and necessary steps are being taken to ensure that the crocodiles do not harm any villager. “During the winter, sometimes crocodiles come out to bask in the sun and we have deployed two of our staffs near the pond. Steps are being taken to protect the villagers,” said N P J Singh, divisional forest officer, Jeypore. Admitting that a crocodile has died after being hit by some unknown vehicle, the officer said a case of unnatural death has been registered and investigation is on.

BICHOLIM: Shirgao residents on Saturday again halted transportation of iron ore through the village. They demanded that mining company first pay their water bills of the last two years.

The residents had stopped transportation of the e-auctioned ore on Monday to protest the failure of the mining companies to pay their pending water bills, but Bicholim deputy collector Sachin Desai had called a special meeting and requested them to allow ore transportation, while assuring them that the mining company would clear the bills. The residents had agreed to the deputy collector’s request and transportation was allowed.

When the residents sought a copy of the minutes of the meeting at the deputy collector’s office on Friday, they found that the said resolution had not been passed. Following that, the irate villagers blocked the ore transportation on Saturday.

Shirgao deputy sarpanch Vijaya Mandrekar said that they won’t allow transportation of ore unless their water bills are paid.

Vijayawada: Tension prevailed at Tenali town in Guntur district on Saturday after YSRC workers hurled eggs and tomatoes at former MLA Alapati Rajendra Prasad and others, who were on a relay fast in support of Amaravati as state capital.

Two youths identified as Chunduru Gopi and Vadeswarapu Anish allegedly set on fire the tent of pro-Amaravati protesters.

However, a major mishap was averted as the alert protesters doused the fire in time even as part of the tent was burnt.

Tenali deputy superintendent of police Srilakshmi told TOI the police will register cases against the attackers after receiving a complaint.

She said once normalcy is restored in the town, police will initiate action against the persons involved.

People, who are in support of Amaravati, were staging protests ever since the capital shift announcement was made by the chief minister in the state assembly. Protesters under the banner of Amaravati Parirakshana Joint Action Committee have been sitting on fast at the protest venue near Tenali municipal office.

Multiple layers of waterproofing has led to a dead load, the expert said

PANAJI: There is no need for Kala Academy’s open-air auditorium to be demolished, it can be repaired, IIT-Madras professor Radhakrisha Pillai said.

Pillai recently carried out an inspection of Kala Academy, following which a meeting was held on the institution’s structural audit. Based on reports by Goa Engineering College (GEC) and Mumbai-based consultancy firm GEM Engserv Pvt Ltd, he ascertained that the primary issue was that of multiple layers of waterproofing, which has led to a dead load.

At the meeting, Pillai spoke about using the cathodic protection technology to arrest further deterioration of steel. Though expensive, the technology works on the principle of electric current, by making the steel bars act as cathodes and uses zinc metal as anodes. This prevents steel from developing additional rust.

Pillai said this technology has been previously adopted in India and has proven to last for over 40 years. The only maintenance needed is that the zinc plates must be changed every 15-20 years, but this is a non-invasive and non-destructive maintenance measure, he said.

KG Guptha, who represented GEC at the meeting, said that in some cases there was over 80% corrosion. Pillai said such spots can be strengthened using measures such as retrofitting.

Guptha suggested the removal of the undesirable dead load from the waterproofing. He also said that to protect it from the rain, the open-air auditorium could be covered with tarpaulin sheets, like it was done in 2019.

Pillai said the National Centre for Safety of Heritage Structures (NCSHS) is willing to take up necessary works, with cooperation from the state government.

Members of the Charles Correa Foundation (CCF) requested KA (then) member secretary Gurudas Pilarenkar to appoint consultants from NCSHS. After deliberation, CCF resolved to give a proposal to take up work along with NCSHS by February 1. Pillai will give a report with a suggested repair methodology by February 29, after discussion with NCSHS coordinator Arun Menon.

On Sunday partly cloudy sky is expected with moderate fog (File photo)

NEW DELHI: It was a chilly morning in the city with the minimum temperature dipping to 4.8 degrees Celsius , three notches below normal.

“The maximum temperature was recorded 21.4 degrees Celsius, a point below normal,” a MeT official said. He said that a fresh and active western disturbance was very likely to affect Western Himalayan region from Monday night onwards, in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. “It may cause rain in Delhi-NCR on Tuesday. On Wednesday, too, light rain or drizzle could be expected in some parts of the city.”

Track the pollution level in your city

On Republic Day on Sunday, partly cloudy sky is expected with moderate fog — dense at isolated places — in the morning. The maximum and minimum temperatures would be around 22 and 7 degrees Celsius respectively.

“Delhi would witness moderate fog while some places in NCR may see heavy fog,” the official said.

The air quality, however, worsened from 151 — in the moderate category — on Friday, to 250 (poor) on Saturday.

An AQI between 0-50 is considered ‘good’, 51-100 ‘satisfactory’, 101-200 ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is classified as ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is classified as ‘very poor’ and between 401 and 500 is ‘severe’ on the Central Pollution Control Board’s index.

Data according to Central Pollution Control Board’s central control room showed Delhi NCR’s average PM2.5 levels recorded at 118.6 micrograms per cubic metre at 7pm on Saturday. The average PM10 levels, at the same time also above the safe standards, were recorded at 213.8 micrograms per cubic metre, data showed. The ‘emergency’ benchmark for these pollutants under GRAP is, respectively, 300 and 500 micrograms per cubic metre while the safe standards are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre.

MeT officials said the wind speed, which was 20-25km per hour on Friday, dipped to 10km per hour on Saturday and caused the air quality to worsen.

According to SAFAR, the AQI may deteriorate to the ‘very poor’ category by Sunday. “A fresh western disturbance is likely to bring marginal improvement in AQI from Monday onwards,” a SAFAR report stated.

306,['26/01/2020'],What should be done to ensure commuters are not inconvenienced?,"This story is from January 26, 2020

With roads closure being implemented in Secunderabad Cantonment ahead of Republic Day, TOI asked readers about what they felt about such restrictions.

Though we welcome the decision of restrictions on the movement on defence roads in the interest of country's security, MoD should make alternate arrangements so that senior citizens and women do not suffer. People have to travel additional distances, especially at night. Did the MoD verify if the alternate roads are safe for late-night commute? The government needs to ensure that all the roads in the city are well-lit and under CCTV surveillance. Safety of citizens should also be taken into consideration.

- Dr GV Kumar

The areas that are curbed for civilian movements connect Bolarum and adjoining areas such as Sainikpuri, Neredmet, Kowkoor to the rest of the city. The arterial roads connecting one end of the city with the rest should not be closed on such short notice. A simple detour also amounts to large investment of time, fuel and effort. Instead of closing all the four arterial roads, they must open at least one, especially for working men, women and students. The alert being declared is always welcome in light of national security. But instead of blocking the roads completely, personnel must be deployed to check the ids of the commuters who are using the route that have been placed under alert.

- Deepesh Surana

While it is understandable that the certain roads may need to be closed due to high alert, it is baffling that the announcement is made on the day of the closure. I am sure the MoD must have understood the need to declare a high-alert situation in lieu of Republic Day well in advance. So then why are Cantonment authorities not informing citizens about road-closure at least a week before the implementation? This would not only help citizens plan accordingly for the days ahead, it would also give LMA the time to provide a list of alternate routes for commuters. The need to block certain roads in the interest of national security is understandable, but authorities must keep commuters abreast of the situation.

- Vidya Raju

While roads closures are not a new phenomenon in Cantonment areas, we must ask why we prefer these roads to the other city roads. Cantonment roads are considered to be safer for women due to the round-the-clock patrolling. The same level of security must also be extended to other roads in the city. The detour amounting to nearly 8kms can be made more comfortable by construction of fly-overs in appropriate places. Better urban planning is pertinent to avoid people facing inconvenience over the closure of a few roads.

309,['26/01/2020'],Gujarat: BPA gets honour for making polls inclusive,"This story is from January 26, 2020

The symbols for ‘EVM’ and ‘VVPAT’ for the speech and hearing impaired that were devised by BPA experts

AHMEDABAD: In the 2019 general election, about 60,000 persons with disabilities (PwD) from Gujarat voted in the festival of democracy. According to experts, this was one of the highest turnouts for PwDs, largely due to several initiatives that made voting booths accessible to wheelchairs and facilitated transport at several places.

The inclusion needed more than that push. Dr Bhushan Punani, executive secretary of city-based Blind People’s Association (BPA), said awareness about the voting process was equally important. “We realized while devising a strategy that there was no sign language for electronic voting machines (EVM) and the voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) unit. We devised symbols for these, along with the voting process, the inking of the finger and the casting of votes. This was utilized across the country to increase awareness,” he said.

This was an initiativs that won the BPA honours at the 10th National Voters’ Day, celebrated by the Election Commission of India (ECI) on Saturday. Dr Punani was among the 20 awardees at the function. He received the award on behalf of the organization from President Ram Nath Kovind , in the category of Civil Services Organization .

“Another initiative implemented in Gujarat was the audio electoral roll or ballot papers. Once candidates for all 26 seats were announced by the ECI, we recorded details such as index number, name and party’s symbol for each constituency and circulated it among election officers. It was later circulated to voters with disabilities,” said Punani. “What we did not realize then was the fact that it also helped inform voters without formal education who had to solely rely on party symbols.”

For the first time, all officers on election duty were trained to make the elections more inclusive, said ECI officials.

310,['26/01/2020'],Drivers glued to their phones emerge as road safety hazard,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The use of cell phones while driving is emerging as a major road safety issue. The number of fatal and non-fatal accidents due to using mobile phones while driving in Visakhapatnam is on a rise. Driving while using phones not only endangers drivers but also other people on the road.

The city traffic police have been issuing nearly 1,200 challans to motorists every day. Of all the challans, between 70 and 100 are related to motorists using their phones while driving.

Speaking to STOI, MRK Raju, ACP (traffic) said, “Despite our awareness campaigns, some young motorists continue to flout traffic rules by driving while speaking on their phones.”

A report by the ministry of road transport and highways showed that in 2018, 7 motorists died and 70 suffered injuries while they were using their phones while driving. Most of those who died were riding two-wheelers.

City police commissioner RK Meena said, “Using mobile phones is integral to modern life, however, using phones while driving is a dangerous trend as motorists lose control over their vehicle as well as their surroundings.”

As per the current laws, if a motorist is found speaking on the phone while driving, a fine of Rs 1,000 will be imposed on them. However, in the coming days, the fine will go up to Rs 5,000, said a senior police official of the traffic wing.

“We are examining CCTV footage at traffic signals in the city to find violators and issue traffic challans to instill fear among violators,” the official said while adding that the new Motor Vehicles Act prescribes steep fines and harsher punishments for traffic violators.

311,['26/01/2020'],"Mumbai: Mixed response to 24x7 test drive at malls, but food courts attract many","Oberoi Mall, Goregaon, at 2.50am.

MUMBAI: Whether it was a tipsy reveller or someone returning from a late night shift in need of some post-movie feeding, several bleary-eyed shops and eateries at city malls remained open beyond midnight hours for people to browse and dine during the test drive of the 24x7 functioning permit on Friday night.The first day first show of shops and restaurants being allowed to remain open till 3am drew a lukewarm response though. Given the lack of awareness about the plan suddenly coming into force two days before the proposed date of the night hours of January 26-27, the footfalls were few and far between despite malls pulling out all the stops—security measures, new recruits, discounts and even open-air movie screenings for free.The late night trial run of food courts and eateries seems to have resolved the long- standing dilemma of late night hunger pangs though. Even if shops and restaurants stayed shut at several malls, food courts did a fine job.Take, for instance, teenage brothers Fahad, Shadab, Fahim and Zayed who live in Pathanwadi. They entered Oberoi Mall in Goregaon at 2.30am for a snack. “On weekends we hang out in the room playing games but this gives us an outlet to step out and experience something different,” said the brothers.Devasish, an event manager who had just gotten off duty at Shanmukhananda Hall in Sion, made a stop at Infiniti Mall in Andheri with his family of five on their way back home in Kandivli. “My entire family is involved in events work. We have uncertain hours and it usually gets late by the time a program is done and we find ourselves scrambling for dinner. When I heard the food court here was to remain open, I thought it was a safe environment for us to come and find something proper to eat. On other days we either have to depend on late night stalls or make do with whatever’s at home,” said Devasish, as he dug into a slice of pizza.But there were many who sauntered into food courts or shops in the afterhours on Friday as they were surprised to find shutters up.Although some pubs and eateries at malls such as Phoenix Market City in Kurla or R City in Ghatkopar were brimming till early hours, only select places stayed open for late night shopping. Dashrath Rathod, a resident of Borivli, for instance, was among the 15-odd people who walked into a lifestyle store at Oberoi Mall after midnight and spent at least an hour with his wife, son and daughter in retail therapy.Meanwhile, very few made their way into malls like Phoenix Market City in Kurla or R City in Ghatkopar late at night, while the food courts and shopping outlets despite the permission to stay open decided to down shutters by 2.45am.Of the three malls that TOI visited in South Mumbai between Colaba and Lower Parel, only one shop seemed to stay open till the early hours and was visited by three patrons, generating a business of about Rs 8,500.Malls in Bhandup and Mulund had put up shutters by 10.30pm while the food court at Galleria, a shopping complex in Powai’s Hiranandani area, shut business by around 1.30am. “It does not make sense to keep eateries open late into the night. This will increase expenses while good footfalls are hard to come by even during the day,” said the owner of an Asian restaurant at Galleria.While most people TOI spoke to seemed upbeat about the perks of longer hours, a few managers of commercial establishments and even late night shoppers were wary of the impact on business in coming days, given the money and manpower needed.If a security guard at Galleria had concerns over how crime rates might spike following late night drinking, police, too, seemed sceptical. One of the 20 policemen parked at a Lower Parel mall said, “This policy is for the rich. See the number of youngsters who are out. We have to keep a close eye on everything to prevent mishaps.”Malls like Infiniti had recruited at least seven extra security guards. “Once the plan is activated we’ll have to be extra cautious. Not all shops will be open and we will have to constantly monitor the movement of people.”Phoenix Market City’s security manager, Ramesh Kharatmol said police had visited the mall and checked their preparedness while inspector M Patil from Kurla police station who had visited said, “We have given a list of security arrangements that has to be followed.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73624326,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-282955,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mixed-response-to-24x7-test-drive-at-malls-but-food-courts-attract-many/articleshow/73620385.cms

Police officers take stock of situation at the guest house on Saturday

JAIPUR: A thirty-one-year-old woman found dead at a guest house in Sanganer on Saturday who had checked in with a 22-year-old man two days ago. The victim has been identified as Pooja Kanjar, a resident of Dooni in Tonk district.

Kanjar’s father rushed to Jaipur after being informed by police about his daughter’s murder . On the basis of her father’s complaint, the police registered an FIR against one Ramkalyan Gurjar under Section 302 of IPC for murder.

Assistant commissioner of police (Sanganer) Poonam Chand Vishnoi said it looked like the accused strangled her with her dupatta. She was found lying in the bed with dupatta tied around her neck. However, the cause of death will be ascertained after post-mortem. Both belonged to Tonk and knew each other for quite some time. However, they were not married. Gurjar left the guest house early morning and a search has been made to nab him, Vishnoi said. The police have also collected the photocopy of ID cards which they submitted to the guest house before checking in.

Guest house owner Rajendra Gujjar told TOI that they told the guest house staff that they were married and submitted their IDs to get the room on Thursday evening. “It did not look like that they had differences between them. But, we do not know what happened inside the room,” said Gujjar.

Gujjar said that on Friday morning, they left the room and told the staff that they would return in the evening asking them to keep the room reserved for them.

“They returned on Friday evening as they told the staff. But, the boy left the guest house at around 4.30 am. When our staff went to switch off the lights at around 5 am, he found that the door of the room was open and the girl was lying in the bed and the man had already left. He informed me and I immediately called the police,” said Gujjar.

Jaipur: After the Jaipur Development Authority’s (JDA) successful endeavour to attract buyers for its recent housing scheme, the civic body is planning to launch two more schemes soon.

The JDA has proposed to launch residential schemes near Muhana Mandi and Manipal University on city’s outskirts. The proposal of the schemes has been prepared.

According to the official source, one scheme proposed as ‘Priyadarshini’ will be launched near Muhana village in zone 11.

The civic body will develop 187 plots. The smallest plot size in this scheme will be 45 square metre. Plot size of 90 sqm and 50 sqm will also be developed in this scheme.

Similarly, another scheme named ‘Mohan Lal Sukhadia’ will be launched in Dahmi Khurd village of same zone where JDA will develop 214 plots.

The largest plot size in this scheme will be 162 sqm. The JDA will also develop plots of different sizes including 126 sqm, 90 sqm, 72 sqm and 45 sqm in this scheme.

In an attempt to fill its coffers, the JDA has planned to launch these schemes. A senior source said, “The proposal for these schemes is prepared and approved in the building planning committee (BPC) meeting.”

The civic body looks confident to sell its plots as it is receiving overwhelming response from residents for proposed Shiv Vihar housing scheme where 346 plots are proposed to be developed.

The civic body is receiving applications in large numbers as the last date is approaching.

A senior official said, “The civic body has received over 42,000 applications so far. The lottery for the scheme will be held on February 5.”

The civic body has fixed a reserve price of Rs 25,000 per square-metre in this scheme.

The plots, sized between 45 square metre to 220 square metre, will be developed in the colony. Officials were expecting good response as it is situated on the 200-Feet Road connecting Muhana and Gopalpura Road.

A senior official said, “The move is expected to boost revenue that will be utilised to develop infrastructure. As the market condition has improved, the JDA filled its coffers after auctioning plots in its old scheme.”

314,['26/01/2020'],"‘Coming out’ as Dalit: A story of reservation, representation","This story is from January 26, 2020

Yashica Dutt

We need to look beyond the binaries of violence and reservation when it comes to Dalit community, said writer Yashica Dutt on Saturday at the 13th edition of the Jaipur Lit Fest (JLF).

Dutt, who “came out” as Dalit after she read scholar and Hyderabad University Rohith Vemula’s suicide note in January 2016, was speaking to author Raghav Chandra and journalist Pragya Tiwari, as they tackled questions around identity and representation.

“I was told to hide my caste from a very young age. I tried to pass off as an upper caste person and slowly, I perfected that act. But when I read Rohith Vemula’s letter, something changed inside me. I decided to use the privilege I had acquired to talk about the trauma that comes with hiding your identity for so long,” she said.

The session provided a critique of the socio-economic system, where “merit” is often used as an excuse to criticise affirmative actions like reservation. “A lot of people speak of quota system as a problematic concept. But they don’t question the reservation that comes with caste, class and network privilege,” Dutt added.

Chandra also agreed, saying that the system has favoured people from upper caste and class backgrounds. “Reservation is the right step, but it is not enough to correct thousands of years of historic discrimination,” he said.

In an indirect attack on the ruling dispensation, Dutt also spoke of “sanskritisation” of Dalit community, which is being co-opted by a “certain party.”

“I cannot speak for the 250 million Dalits in India but it’s clear that there are attempts to appropriate the community by giving them a sense of power. People are being promised a seat at the table, but that place would be at the foot of the table with no actual say,” she said.

“The seven PSUs have paid around Rs 24 crore so far for the construction of the CSR block. Rs 29 crore is pending. Unless at least Rs 12 crore is released to the contractor, work will not resume. The work for the CSR block has been stalled for around six months due to the lack of funds,” he added.

MP MVV Satyanarayana assured doctors that he will pursue the PSUs about releasing pending funds.

AHMEDABAD: The haplessness of common people while seeking services from the police came into sharp focus, in the case of an autorickshaw driver, whose complaint for the theft of his rickshaw, Krishnanagar police refused to take several time. The driver, Yogesh Baghel, 23, was finally forced to make a representation to DGP Shivanand Jha , who directed crime branch to take his complaint and investigate the alleged misconduct of police personnel of Krishnanagar police station.

According to the FIR lodged at crime branch, Baghel’s auto was stolen on November 26, when he and his father were at their native village in Uttar Pradesh . He was informed of the theft by his mother, Gulab.

The FIR states that Baghel then came to the city and went to Krishnanagar police station, where a plain clothes policeman told him that finding stolen rickshaws was not their work and he should find it himself. According to crime branch officials, on November 26, Baghel learned that Rambahadur Soni had stolen his auto, at the instance of one Baccha Singh of Thakkarnagar.

On November 27, Baghel again went to Krishnagar police station and told them that Soni had taken his rickshaw. The cops did nothing but made him sign a paper with something written on it. To make a living, Baghel then started driving a rented autorickshaw. On January 17, he saw Soni near Vijay Park and caught him. “He then called the police controll room on 100. A PCR van arrived and took both of them to Krishnanagar police station. They were taken to the D Staff office, where Soni told the cops that he had stolen the rickshaw at the instance of Baccha Singh and took the rickshaw to Unava on his instruction. Krishnagar police told Baghel to go to Unava and get the rickshaw,” a crime branch official said.

The FIR states that the next day he went to Unava but could not find the autorickshaw. “He then went to Unava police station and asked them to file an FIR, but they said the offence did not take place in their jurisdiction but in Krishnanagar,” a crime branch official said. According to the FIR, he went to Krishnagar police station twice, but his complaint was not registered. Baghel and his mother finally went to DGP Shivananad Jha and told him about the entire episode. “The DGP directed us to register an FIR. We will probe the case and strict action will be taken,” a crime branch official said.

Amitabh Kant at a session

The Centre may have declared rural India open defecation free on October 2, 2019, but the claim was countered at the Jaipur Literature Festival forcing Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog to say that Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) was not an infrastructure project or construction of toilets alone, but creating a massive people’s movement for ushering in a behavioural change.

While giving a low-down of SBM captured in the book “The Swachh Bharat Revolution: Four Pillars of India's Behavioural Transformation” by Parameswaran Iyer, secretary at the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, the bureaucrat said that rural sanitation coverage was 38% when the programme started in 2014 but within five years, the campaign has achieved 100% target, changing the behaviour of 550 million people.

But fellow panelist Namita Waikar, managing editor and co-founder of the People’s Archive of Rural India, drew attention to the fact that data does not reflect the ground realities. “I challenge you to walk into any slum area in any city, marginal areas of any village or the railway tracks, you will find shit there. We are not defecation free,” said Waikar.

Referring to the garbage problems that urban areas face, Kant said that the challenge is that in the next five decades, India has to create two Americas in an innovative and sustainable manner.

“For India, lot of lessons come from eastern part of the world like Singapore where waste use is minimised at the household level. A great example of that is what Indore and Bhopal have done. They have managed to reduce household waste by about 40-45% just by segregating at the household level. They have converted waste into methane and methane into gas that is used for public transportation.”

“This is the first government which has talked about 100 smart cities. The challenge would be how do we do compact dense urbanization. The days of sprawling urbanization are over. America had sprawling urbanisation when it had land and water all available and its cities were made for cars. American car companies bought over railways and destroyed them so that cars could be sold. But today most of the successful urbanization is compactness and denseness, so that you are able to use public transportation and not use individual cars,” added Kant.

Bareilly: The Bareilly Municipal Corporation (BMC) is gearing up to launch a massive crackdown against defaulters of house, water and sewer taxes. BMC officials said initially, they would target 20 big defaulters each in 80 wards whose arrears are to the tunes of lakhs of rupee.

According to information from the BMC tax department, the civic body has identified around 10,000 big and small tax defaulters, including commercial and residential, across the city and has initiated the process of issuing notices to them. Their properties would be sealed if they failed to clear the taxes, officials said.

We are targeting 20 such defaulters in each ward. We have also initiated the process of serving notices, warning them that their properties will be sealed, if they fail to pay their dues at the earliest. We have to recover a collectively arrear of around Rs 40 crore from defaulters by March-end.”

Zonal officer, BMC tax department, Vipin Kuldeep said, “Around 10,000 tax defaulters (big and small) have been identified across the city, including commercials establishments such as restaurants, hotels, showrooms, godowns, shops, salons, cinema halls, residential properties, among others. Their properties have tax arrears ranging from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 15 lakh.”

Saxena added, “With the department gearing up to take action, defaulters have started clearing their dues, but most of them are yet not paying any heed to our warning. A few of them have paid initial amount. Last week, around Rs 30 lakh was recovered. The drive will be intensified by four teams comprising six members each.”

According to BMC sources, the taxes are main source of income for the civic body, and thus, the recovery of taxes is important. Non-payment of taxes hits maintenance and development works severely.

According to rules, BMC initially generates bills and sends it to defaulters, ssking payment of taxes within 15 days. In case of non-payment within the stipulated time, a demand notice is served and an additional 15 days is granted. However, if defaulters fail to pay their dues, the process of attachment of their property is initiated, according to BMC officials.

322,['26/01/2020'],Seminar to discuss ways to attract more foreign pupils,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Pune: The Centre is working on a slew of measures, including fellowships for humanities students, relaxing visa norms and starting a basic English test to attract more foreign students.

To begin this, a two-day “Destination India” conference would be held at Symbiosis International University on January 28 and 29 to discuss how to attract more foreign students to India. It will be attended by all stakeholders, including members from the police and other parts of the civil society.

At the end of the conference, a road map would be prepared to make India an attractive destination for students abroad. “India ranks third in the list of countries sending their students abroad. But, when it comes to receiving foreign students, we rank 26th. We only have about 47,000 foreign students enrolled for formal education in India. The target is to take this number to 2 lakh by 2020,” Namrata Kumar, the deputy director general of Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), said.

She added that the number of foreign students was much higher than 47,000 as many come to India on tourist visas and take up informal education or a training programme. The agencies are finding it hard to keep a track of this and to ease out the mechanism and the ICCR is trying to centralize the entire data, Kumar said. “At present, individual universities or institutes might have this data. Many people come and join Yoga courses, or dance courses which again are informal. We need to collate this data so that we can provide a better experience for the students and when they go back to their countries, they become our brand ambassadors,” she said.

Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad attract the highest number of foreign students in the country, with the SPPU and Symbiosis International University each getting roughly 3,000 students a year, Kumar said.

She said many students coming from Africa or the middle-eastern countries had been facing problems with English and universities as well ICCR were conducting various courses to bridge the gap. “Yes, there are talks at the national-level about introducing an examination (of English),” Kumar said.

One of the major glitches was foreign students not being able to apply for internships or training programmes with their Indian counterparts, said Vidya Yeravdekar, the principal director of Symbiosis Society. While visa norms were strict across the world, talks were on at the national-level to chalk out how to relax visa norms for foreign students, an official said.

Rajesh Patnekar

PANAJI: Goa speaker Rajesh Patnekar will begin hearings in the two disqualification petitions filed by Congress and MGP against their MLAs who joined BJP. The speaker has scheduled the hearing for February 13 and 14 .

“You (MLAs and petitioners) are requested to take notice. In default of your appearance, either in person or through counsel, the petition shall be heard and determined in your absence,” the notice issued to petitioners and respondents said.

In May 2019, senior MGP functionary and former deputy chief minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar filed a petition before the speaker seeking disqualification of deputy CM Manohar Ajgaonkar and PWD minister Deepak Pauskar, who quit MGP to join BJP in March 2019.

The MGP challenged their claim that two-thirds of MGP legislature party has merged with BJP. MGP had three MLAs in the 40-member House, and it has now been reduced to one.

Dhavalikar had said that the 10th schedule of the Constitution does not postulate such a merger, by which the members of the legislature party would meet at midnight and claim that a merger has taken place.

In August 2019, Congress filed a disqualification petition against their 10 rebel MLAs who joined BJP in July 2019. State Congress president Girish Chodankar had sought that the 10 MLAs be restrained from attending assembly proceedings and holding constitutional posts till the case is decided by the speaker.

On July 10, rebel Congress MLAs led by Chandrakant Kavalekar joined BJP claiming that the Congress Legislature Party had split. The remaining nine MLAs were Isidore Fernandes, Nilkanth Halarnkar, revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate, Antonio Fernandes , Francisco Silveira , Wilfred Dsa, Clafasio Dias, Filipe Rodrigues and Atanasio Monserrate.

Bareilly: A rape survivor’s husband has been booked for allegedly barging into a house in an inebriated condition, thrashing and attempting to outrage the modesty of a woman there.

A complaint to the effect was lodged by the daughter-in-law of one of the men who was accused of raping the former’s wife.

According to Avnish Yadav, SHO of Bareilly Cantonment police station, told TOI, “The 35-year-old man had trespassed into the house of a married woman and attempted to rape her on Friday night He allegedly thrashed her after failing to rape her. The man was drunk. He also threatened to kill her. We have filed an FIR under IPC sections 354 (attempt to outrage the modesty of a woman), 452 (house trespass with intent to hurt), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 504 (intentional insult). We have detained the accused who was so drunk that he misbehaved with us as well. His wife had earlier registered a rape complaint against a few villagers and the investigation of that case is on.”

According to police, earlier, the man’s 32-year-old wife had filed a rape case against four identified and 35 unidentified people with the police on December 17. She had met the SSP of Bareilly and lodged a complaint, alleging that she was thrashed and gang-raped by Amit, Shambhu, Chaman, and Pushpendra. She alleged that her tormentors had shot a video of the assault and later forced her to cohabit with 35 others over a period of one year.

She had also alleged that one of the accused, Amit, stole Rs 50,000 from her house.

At that time, police had filed an FIR against the four named men and unidentified persons under IPC sections 376-D (gang-rape), 392 (robbery), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) and provisions of the Information and Technology Act.

Later, several villagers staged a protest against the woman and claimed that she had filed a fake complaint because her husband had borrowed money from the people booked for gangrape.

Bareilly: A joint team of the UP Special Task Force (STF) and Bareilly police on Saturday arrested the leader of notorious Bawaria gang, which had committed over 50 robberies in Bareilly, Rampur and other parts of the country.

According to police, Tavar Ali (45) was planning to commit another robbery in Bareilly. He was nabbed near the railway station in Kotwali area of Bareilly city at 3.30 am.

Ali was wanted by the police since 2017 after he committed nearly a dozen robberies in Bareilly and Rampur. UP DGP had announced a bounty of Rs 50,000 on him.

“Tavar Ali is a cunning criminal, who was always on the move. He doesn’t use a mobile phone which is why it was quite difficult to trace him. We had been searching for him for the past two years. During interrogation, Ali told that he has committed robberies in many states, including UP, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra. His gang members used to stay with the caravan of their tribe members and gather information about their target. We have sought their criminal history from other states. We are now searching for two persons whom Ali was going to meet in Bareilly,” SSP Bareilly Shailesh Pandey told TOI,

Ali was earlier arrested in 2018 by Rampur police and remained in jail till 2017. He is believed to be operating several Bawaria gangs who used to travel across the country and commit robberies. Ali used to operate under pseudo names in other states to conceal his identity.

Tavar Ali, who hails from Dera Singahi village in Bhuta area of Bareilly district, came into notice for the first time in 2010 when he committed a robbery in Rampur district.

After his arrest, police had booked him under the ‘Gangster Act’. After returning from jail in 2017, Ali again committed a string of robberies in several parts of Bareilly. His gang members were arrested, but he always managed to escape.

However, the STF team had an upper hand on him when he planned to return to Bareilly almost after a year.

Kolhapur: Two people were killed in a road accident when an Omni van carrying six family members crashed into sugarcane carrying tractor at Appachi wadi on Friday night.

Steven Alvares, regional transport officer, Kolhapur , told TOI that they have given reflector tapes to all such tractors. “We are not aware of the accident details yet. This season we are quite sure it will help reduce the accidents,” he said.

Alvares admitted that in the past, several incidents of road accidents have happened due to the non-availability of the reflective tapes. “The trailers which are carrying the sugarcane can shadow the reflectors; hence it is mandatory to hang a removable reflective cloth with radium on the sugarcane so that it can be visible from distance,” he said.

He said that they have already warned the sugar mills that they will be considered co-accused in such cases if the reflective tapes are found missing from the tractor. He added that police will file cases against the vehicle owners and farmers, who do not use the visible reflective stickers under the Motor Vehicle Act.

The transport official had earlier said that they will organise an enforcement drive across the district to identify the violators and impose fine on such vehicles.

Alvares on the road fatalities in the district said that in 2018 the number of road accidents were 940, while the number reduced to 930 the following year.

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Residents from many parts within the civic body limits are unsatisfied with the alternate day water supply , that has been in vogue for two months now, and have demanded the restoration of daily supply.

But the civic administration claims that the water supply complaints have reduced in two months. Makrand Nikam, joint city engineer and chief of water supply department, said, “The number of complaints has reduced but their figures cannot be disclosed. We get complaints of water pipeline burst, contaminated water supply and others from various parts of the city which we quickly resolve.”

The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) had begun the alternate day water supply on November 25 claiming that it was a temporary measure undertaken to ensure equitable water supply. A review of it was awaited in two months, that is, on January 25.

The civic administration drew lot of flak from activists, organizations and opposition parties as the Pavana dam was 100% full while this measure was being implemented.

Chairman Santosh Kanase, of a housing society called Shri Ganesh Inspira, said, “We are partially dependent on borewells as the water supplied by PCMC is insufficient. We also have to purchase 2 to 3 water tankers daily to meet the needs of residents in 174 flats in the society. On weekends we need 4 to 5 tankers as water consumption is higher. We receive municipal water at low pressure. PCMC must provide water tankers at subsidized rates.”

Sachin Sanap, a resident of a housing society in Akurdi said they were somehow managing to meet their requirements from whatever water they got from the civic body as it was costly to purchase water tankers.

Prajakta Rudrawar , chairperson of Celestial society federation in Ravet, said, “There are 704 flats in around 22 housing societies in the federation that receive water supply at low pressure. In my society we have implemented water conservation measures to avoid purchasing water tankers”.

Rahul Deshpande, chairman, Anuprabha housing society of 11 flats in Pimple Nilakh said they purchase 2 to 3 water tankers per week.

Siddha Parveen (10) recalled hearing the roof beams creak a few days ago but no one thought much of it

NEW DELHI: There was a loud rumble and everything turned dark after that, recalled 10-year-old Siddha Parveen at the emergency unit of Jag Parvesh Hospital in east Delhi. For three years, she and her eight-year-old sister Busra had been going for tutorials to the ill-fated building in Bhajanpura whose roof collapsed on Saturday. Lying in the hospital bed, Siddha recalled hearing the roof beams creak a few days ago though no one thought much of it.

Siddha, Busra, Aarti and Uma Bharti were lucky they only suffered limb fractures and head injuries and did not lose their lives in the cave-in as their teacher and four others did. The teacher, Umesh, was giving them history lesson when debris rained down on them.

Aarti was panic-struck to find herself trapped in pieces of concrete from her waist down. “I could hear my classmates crying from under the debris,” she said. “But I couldn’t move my hand even to pull myself out of the pit. My life was probably saved because the cement portion that fell on me was wet and fresh.”

Umesh and his brother Shankar were running the tuition service in the building for three years. According to the families of the students, classes were held through the day, with each batch of students there for two hours. “It is the only tuition centre for children between the ages of 7 and 14 in the locality. Each batch has around 30 children,” disclosed Naveen Kumar, a teacher. “On Saturday, with most students having taken leave for Republic Day, the attendance was half.” Kumar himself had a close shave having just finished his classes and left the building when the roof crashed down.

Asif Khan, Siddha’s father, revealed that the tuition classes were earlier held in a nearby building, but had shifted to its current location three years ago. “We didn’t know that another floor was being illegally constructed,” Khan said. Chastened and relieved to have been spared more tragedy, the auto-rickshaw driver said, “From now on, rather than sending them to tuition centres, I will rather teach them at home with whatever knowledge I have.”

JAIPUR: The Zameen Samadhi Satyagraha organised by the farmers whose lands were acquired by the Centre for the Bharatmala Delhi-Mumbai Expressway project entered third day in Dausa as they have been demanding a compensation four times the district level committee (DLC) rates or the market value of the land.

The farmers have been agitating under the banner Pradesh Kisan Sangharsh Samiti and would continue their agitation till their demands are not fulfilled. BJP MP Kirori Lal Meena had also joined the Satyagraha, which began in Dausa on Thursday, in support of the farmers.

""We met the chief minister ( Ashok Gehlot ). He had assured us that he would take up the matter with the centre. It has been 7 months since we met him, but nothing been done so far,"" said leader of Pradesh Kisan Sangharsh Samiti Himmat Singh . About 2,000 farmers in the state have been affected by the land acquisition. “The district level committee (DLC) rates for land acquisition have been fixed at a low rate, reducing it by 25% in 2018 in Rajasthan. We demand a compensation four times the DLC rates or market value of the land. In some places, they are giving it at 2 or 2.5 times the value,” he added. “In 2016, the BJP government issued a circular to dilute the Land Acquisition Act, 2013. That circular, which sought to reduce the compensation rates of farmers, must be annuled,” he added. Under Bharatmala project, Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will cross Alwar, Dausa, Sawai Madhopur, Kota and Jhalawar in Rajasthan. The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway project will pass through five states.

The 12-lane expressway will reduce the distance by 120km. Of the total distance, around 380km road will be developed in Rajasthan, 120km in Gujarat, 300km in Madhya Pradesh and 370 km in Maharashtra.

During the meeting, Patil asked the experts to come up with suggestions and recommendations on improving traffic condition in the city. He also told them that the administration is planning to develop three new bridges in the city as well as traffic signals at 12 different spots.

CREDAI experts recommended the construction of four major roads which were initially proposed in the municipal corporation’s development plan (DP), but were never built due to unknown reasons.

Vidyanand Bedekar, president of CREDAI, Kolhapur, said, “The construction of four roads — from Lishan Hotel Chowk to Kadamwadi, Shahu Sanskrutik Bhavan to Sugar Mill of Bawda, Sugar Mill to Khanvilkar Petrol Pump and Khanvilkar Petrol Pump to Shivaji Bridge — should be developed on priority. We are going to plan the model-roads which will be executed by the KMC and the state government. These roads will help to divert the traffic movement thereby easing the congestion in the internal parts of the city. Also, we have recommended connecting the smaller roads to the major ones properly. We will soon submit the plan along with the traffic movement study.”

The process of drafting the development plan for city roads is underway. Patil has asked the experts to take stock of the number of roads mentioned in the DP and the problems associated with the development of these roads.

In addition, Patil said that he will grant Rs 1.5 crore funds towards installing of the traffic signals at 12 places in the city. At present, 17 traffic signals operate in the city and most of them are located in the core areas. The fringe areas and suburbs do not have the traffic signalling system. Therefore, signals will now be installed on new roads.

CALANGUTE: A woman from Uganda, Minamu Hafusa , 22, was arrested on Saturday in connection with the alleged murder of Aldona resident Zeferino Barretto. Barretto was found dead at Saunta Vaddo, Calangute , on Friday morning.

Following investigations, Calangute police had zeroed in on the Ugandan as she had been spotted with Barretto in the hours before he was found dead. She was subsequently traced in Anjuna and was taken into custody by Anjuna police early Saturday morning.

Hafusa was later transferred to the custody of the Calangute police.

Calangute PI Nolasco Raposo told TOI that they would seek her remand in police custody for questioning on Sunday. Sources said Barretto worked as a waiter at a hotel in Guirim. Raposo said they would be able to ascertain the motive behind his murder and whether there were other persons involved only after the custodial interrogation of the Ugandan woman.

Speculation, however, was rife that the Aldona resident was murdered over a dispute over payments to the Ugandans for narcotic drugs.

Zeferino, 45, was found dead with his face smashed on Friday morning in a lane near the Baga bridge.

Representative image

PUNE: The army headquarters recruiting zone, Pune, which covers five army recruitment offices in the state, has come across 400 instances of ‘ agents ’ extracting money from job aspirants in the past one year on the pretext of helping them secure admit cards for participation in army recruitment rallies.

The ‘agents’ operate despite the fact that enrolment for army recruitment rallies takes place through a dedicated website ‘joinindianarmy.nic.in’.

“The agents take advantage of the situation like poor internet penetration and connectivity issues in rural areas, which account for the bulk of aspirants, and lack of awareness about the recruitment process. They offer services to job aspirants for getting admit cards and, in some cases, even assure jobs in the army,” a senior recruiting zone officer told TOI.

“Once an aspirant accepts the offer, the agent fills the online form on behalf of the candidate with details of his email ID and cellphone number, instead of the candidate’s. The details of the admit card and alert are received at the agent’s email ID and cellphone and he seeks money from the candidate for handing over the admit card,” the officer said.

He said, “In the last one year, the five army recruitment offices in Maharashtra have come across 400 such instances through the grievance redressal mechanism. Some of these had to be resolved during the course of the recruitment rallies.”

To overcome the problem, the army has been conducting awareness drives through lectures and speeches at recruitment rallies, besides organising such events at schools and colleges. The army has made several motivational documentaries, flex boards, leaflets, calendars and other such publicity materials about its recruitment process which they distribute round the year and at every rally. A set of advisory related to recruitment procedure has been posted on ‘ joinindianarmy.nic.in ’.

Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: The Gakuved (Gawda, Kunbi, Velip, Dhangar) Federation, that works for the upliftment of the tribal community in Goa, has invited chief minister Pramod Sawant for an open debate and discussion on the CAA, NRC and NPR.

Expressing uncertainity about the fate of tribals if the NRC is implemented in Goa, general secretary of the federation Rupesh Soiru Velip said, “Goan tribals have seen with great shock and pain what happened to tribals of Assam due to the implementation of NRC. Out of the 19 lakh people in Assam who have lost citizenship of India, 13 lakh were poor tribals who had no documents to prove their citizenship. The government, instead of rushing to aid them, are plotting to send them to detention camps, where the fate of hunger and death awaits.

The federation is ready for an open debate and discussion on the CAA, NRC and NPR with the chief minister, Velip stated.

“If the chief minister and his government are really concerned about the development of the ST community, he should first declare and notify scheduled areas in the state of Goa as per the Vth schedule of the Constitution of India before March 31, 2020 as the implementation of the NPR will start from April onwards,” Velip stated. The CAA, NRC and NPR will together strip Goan tribals of our land , forest and agricultural rights, besides our voting rights and liberty, and that is why we are opposing it, he said.

“When the caste certificate (ST certificate) is itself proof that we are original citizens and settlers of this country, why do we need to prove it again now?” he said.

Pune: A 46-year-old woman pedestrian was killed in a hit-and-run accident after a speeding dumper hit her from the rear while she was crossing the Vishrantwadi-Dhanorie Road via Maharana Pratap Chowk around 1pm on Friday.

The Vishrantwadi police on Saturday arrested the dumper driver, Ramesh Tatya Pawar (26), of Lohegaon on the charge of causing death due to rash and negligent driving under the Indian Penal Code, along with sections of the Motor Vehicle Act.

The deceased has been identified as Yogita Chandan Sonawane, also from Lohegaon. “The dumper, which was speeding, was heading towards Vishrantwadi from Dhanorie when the driver lost control over the vehicle and hit Sonawane from behind. The woman was in the process of crossing the road,” assistant inspector Sachin Nikam of the Vishrantwadi police said.

Nikam said the passersby rushed Sonawane to a nearby hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival. “The doctors attributed multiple head injuries to be the cause of her death,” the officer said.

He said the police were apprised of the accident by the hospital authorities, following which their investigation started and the driver was arrested.

“Probe revealed the driver had abandoned the dumper and fled the spot after hitting the woman on Friday. He feared that the bystanders would physically assault him. We have seized the dumper for conducting inspection with the Regional Transport Office, Pune. The driver was arrested on Saturday,” Nikam said.

“We registered a suo moto case against the driver as Sonawane’s family members had gone to their native place in Osmanabad for performing her last rites,” Nikam said.

345,['26/01/2020'],Yashwantgad: 17th century fort in ruins,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Yashwantgad, a heritage fort looked after by the government of Maharashtra, is a tiny remote village on the west coast of Maharashtra. This 17th century fort is one of the less-explored places in the state. Though the fort is partially in ruins, it is definitely a place worth visiting as it is surrounded by plush greenery and is built on the banks of Arjuna river. Nature lovers, history lovers, trekkers, explorers — Yashwantgad has a lot to offer to anyone who visits this less-explored destination.

How to reach

Located in the Nate village in Rajapur taluka of Ratnagiri district, Yashwantgad is located at a distance of 135km from Kolhapur city. It takes about three-and-a-half hours to reach this beach-side fort via Anuskura ghat- Rajapur- Nate route or the Ratnagiri- Adivare- Nate route. One can also visit the Ambolgad fort and Kasheli’s Kanakaditya temple en-route Yashwantgad.

Legend has it

The history of this fort dates back to 17th century. Anuj Devstalhi, a local guide at the fort, said “Both the forts — Yashwantgad and Ambolgad — were built during the time of Chhatrapati Shivaji to protect Konkan from enemies attacking through the coastal route or via backwaters. Yashwantgad is located on a creek next to Arjuna river backwaters while the Ambolgad is located on the sea front. It is believed that there was a hidden tunnel route to that connected Yashwantgad to Vijaydurg fort. It was used in times of crisis to escape from enemies. On Yashwantgad, one can see a 4 ft wide and 6 ft deep trench created to avoid direct attacks by the enemy. This fort still holds many structures, of which a 100 ft deep well from the Pandava era with caves within is the major attraction. Earlier, the fort had 17 bastions. Today, the fort is in a bad shape and is surrounded by trees and grass. It needs proper maintenance so that the heritage is protected. The fort is officially a ‘protected monument’ under the Maharashtra Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1960.”

Flora and fauna

Yashwantgad offers stunning landscapes of the sea. It is a perfect mix of sun, sand, sea and nature. Monkeys, squirrels, birds and a variety of trees including mango, coconut, cashew, and banyan can be found in the vicinity of this fort. There are no food joints nearby, so visitors are recomended that they carry snacks and water with them.

Pune: A residents’ group has sent a letter to the civic body against keeping trucks carrying remains of dead animals parked outside the incinerator next to Naidu Hospital for long hours.

Sushma Date, a member of the Deccan Gymkhana Parisar Samiti, said, “The rotting flesh of animals in these trucks not only causes an unbearable stench in the area, but can be hazardous to the staffers and patients of Naidu Hospital as well as the employees working at the incinerator and the nearby dog pound.”

Samiti members said while it was understandable that Swachh Suvrekshan inspection was going on and sending the abattoir waste to the incinerator could be a temporary arrangement, it was still a health hazard to the people living and working in the area.

Date said the Samiti has requested the civic authorities to visit the area to take stock of the unsanitary conditions outside the incinerator. “The incinerator should only be used for the cremation of animal carcasses and not for slaughterhouse remains. The abattoir waste should be disposed off through the appropriate bio-medical waste system,” she added.

Dnyaneshwar Molak, joint commissioner and solid waste management head of the Pune Municipal Corporation, told TOI that there was no specification that the incinerator could not be used for incinerating slaughterhouse waste. “Due to the low capacity of this incinerator, the trucks carrying slaughterhouse waste have to stay parked outside the incinerator premises for a longer time,” he said.

Molak said the PMC had proposed to set up another animal carcasses’ incinerator in the city elsewhere, though the place was yet to be decided. “The proposed incinerator will not only have a higher capacity but will also be more advanced technologically,” he said.

Bareilly: In the backdrop of the gunning down of an undertrial a Bijnor court last month, the district judge of Bareilly has issued a notice instructing to all lawyers practicing in the court to submit their details in a prescribed form latest by January 31 in order to prepare a roll of those practising there.

District judge Arun Kumar Mishra said a roll of practising lawyers would be prepared so that only those enrolled would be able to work in court. According to sources, close 1,600 lawyers are registered with the District Bar Association.

District government counsel Suneeti Pathak told TOI, “We have witnessed several incidents in the past when owing to rivalries, undertrials have been shot dead inside the courtroom after they were brought there from jail for a hearing. The recent incident took place in Bijnor court, where an undertrial was killed in front of the judge by three assailants.”

He added, “Now, each advocate registered with the district court will be issued an ID card and will be allowed to enter the court premises only after showing that.”

On December 17, three assailants, including two minors, had gunned down Shahnawaz Ansari, an accused in the double murder of BSP politician Ahsan Khan and his nephew in the courtroom. Ansari had been brought from Delhi’s Tihar jail.

After the murder, the Allahabad high court took suo motu cognizance of the incident inside the courtroom and summoned additional chief secretary (home) and director general of police, asking them to furnish a plan to strengthen security at courts’ premises across the state.

Earlier in February 2015, a dreaded gangster, Vicky Tyagi, was murdered inside the courtroom in Muzaffarnagar by a minor who had arrived there donning a lawyer’s robe.

Taking cognizance of such incidents, the Allahabad HC had issued directions to all courts across the state to prepare advocates’ roll as maintained in the high court.

The Sainik Schools Society, ministry of defence, does not make any calls related to admission nor does it authorize anyone on its behalf to do so. Please follow the developments only on the online portal of Sainik Schools Admission — sainikschooladmission.in,"" said the principal of the school in an advisory issued on the website.

The school conducted its entrance examination across the country in the first week of January.

A section of parents wondered, “How did these cheats get access to information which was submitted to the government? It’s a serious issue and the authorities concerned need to have counter measures,” said parents, who did not wish to be named.

“The callers told me that my son is short of 20 marks to secure admission in the school. He even quoted specific details about my son and was even aware about the examination centre. He then demanded Rs20,000 and sent his bank details and alternative mobile number. I received at least 20 calls in a day from the caller,” said a father.

PANAJI: Various Hindu organisations conducted a demonstration here on Saturday demanding the implementation of the National Registry of Citizens (NRC) in Goa, to “solve the increasing problems caused due to Bangladeshi infiltrators”.

Members of the outfits, assembled under the banner national Hindu movement (NHM), said there were more than five crore ‘Bangladeshi Muslim infiltrators’ living in India, and they were “causing a drain on the basic facilities and resources belonging to Indian citizens.”.

Hindu Janajagruti Samiti's Satyavijay Naik said Bangladeshis in Goa were involved in fish and vegetable trade, collection of scrap and even prostitution, and called for action against those supporting ‘Bangladeshi infiltrators’ involved in various trades in Goa, to publicise the photographs and lists of ‘infiltrators’, and to thoroughly check the background of candidates before employing them.

353,['26/01/2020'],Bareilly dist reports 167 malaria cases in Jan despite biting cold,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Bareilly: Bareilly district reported 167 malaria cases in January despite both maximum and minimum temperatures plunged several notches below normal, making mosquitoes inactive.

The number of positive cases is, however, slightly higher than January 2019 when 160 malaria cases were reported.

Of the 167 cases reported this month, 21 are of “deadly” malaria strain — plasmodium falciparum (PF) — while the remaining are a milder form of malaria — plasmodium vivax (PV). Health department officials said the number of deadly malaria cases reduced in comparison to the corresponding month the last year, which recorded 84 PF cases.

Meanwhile, the health department has received 16,000 long-lasting insecticide nets (LLINs), which accredited social health activists (Asha) and auxiliary nurse midwives (ANM) will distribute in PF-affected villages.

LLINs mosquito nets come with an insecticide coating that kills mosquito when it sits on the net. Officials said LLINs would be given on priority basis to those households whose maximum members were tested positive for malaria last year.

District malaria officer DR Singh said, “ANM and Asha workers will give one LLIN to a family. As thousands of people were tested positive for malaria last year, ANMs and Ashas will give preference to those households which reported a maximum number of malaria cases. LLINs will be distributed among families of pregnant women and children diagnosed with malaria last year.”

Singh added the distribution of LLINs would start in the first week of February.

Out of 16,000 LLINs, 5,000 each will be distributed in Majhagavan and Bhamora, which reported highest malaria cases, while 1,000 each will be given in Ramnagar, Faridpur, Kyara, Meerganj and Fatehganj West.

In Bareilly district, 46,717 malaria cases, including 12,141 PF cases, were detected in 2019. However, in 2018, 37,382 cases were reported.

Speaking to mediapersons, Sardesai said “I think we should have a debate on CAA. I think the government will give us a debate on CAA, as the CM himself has said it.

A firefighter douses a fire that broke out at Delhi Transport Department office at Civil Lines in Delhi on Mon... Read More

NEW DELHI: The building whose roof collapsed and killed people in east Delhi on Saturday neither had its building plan approved nor was it licensed to run coaching classes inside. Preliminary investigation by a local civic official revealed that the building was 10-15 year old with an angled iron roof supported with stones. “It was an old roof,” the official said. “It wasn’t made of concrete and of the type no longer used in house construction.”

According to the official, such iron beam-stone roofs are weakened by moisture over the years, but said the actual cause of the collapse on Saturday will be determined only after a detailed probe.

The commissioner of East Delhi Municipal Corporation directed the deputy commissioner of Shahadra (north) to conduct an inquiry and submit the report by Monday. The site of the accident is in a Bhajanpura colony that was regularised in the 1990s. The fact that a regularised colony still had buildings without sanctioned plans raised doubts about the efficacy of the regularisation process.

Municipal officials refuted reports that a coaching centre operated out of the building. “We have been informed that a teacher provided tuition services from his home. All places where teaching takes place can’t be termed coaching centres,” insisted a civic official. EDMC mayor Anju Kamalkant said that a survey of coaching centres had been undertaken last year but did not cover the smaller tuition centres. “I have directed the entire area be scanned for other such weakened roofs,” she said, adding there were was no record of tuition centres.

Despite all the assessment exercises conducted after the fire in a coaching centre in Surat, Gujarat, took a toll of 22 lives in May 2019, Saturday’s ghastly incident appeared to show that not much had improved on the ground in Delhi and the capital’s students continued to risk their lives studying in dangerous structures.

Though teaching centres do not require any trade licence to operate, chapter 15 of Master Plan Delhi 2021 provides several categories of relaxations for non-residential activities in residential areas. While educational coaching is permitted as such an activity, conditions are clearly spelt out for minimum area requirement, approved construction, structural norms and fire safety.

“It is not as if MPD straightaway grants permission to people to run coaching centres in residential areas. A large number of conditions have to be fulfilled. But both the fire department and the local bodies have failed to crack down on large scale MPD violations,"" the official remarked.

MUMBAI: Three persons suspected of having the 2019 novel coronavirus infection continued to be in isolation in civic-run Kasturba Hospital near Saat Rasta on Saturday despite two of them testing negative for the virus .

No new persons were placed under isolation in Mumbai or the Maharashtra, said health officials who were part of a high-powered review meeting held by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray , who has called another meeting on Monday.

BMC officials said there are government guidelines on how to handle patients, incubation and observation periods for the virus before discharging the two patients—a male Kalyan resident and a 31-year-old female from Nalasopara— who had fever-like symptoms on returning from China. “We will discharge the patients on the basis of guidelines.”

The laboratory diagnosis for the third person, a 65-year-old UK national who came from Hong Kong on January 10 and was admitted to Kasturba on Friday, wasn’t available till late on Saturday. Samples of people in isolation are sent to the National Institute of Virology , Pune. State officials said 2,056 passengers have been screened at the airport.

The CM asked health officials to be prepared to handle more samples for tests, if needed. As symptoms of the novel coronavirus and common cold are similar, he asked the department to prepare guidelines to identify the difference. A Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention & Control Technical Committee team has begun work on these.

Kolkata: On Republic Day eve, anti-CAA protesters in Kolkata and Howrah went about their preparations for the D-Day when they will join a human chain in the first half and participate in cultural functions reflecting the Freedom struggle in the second. However, police have not given permission for the human chain as they do not want the general public to be inconvenienced by traffic restrictions. Mayor Firhad Hakim, too, expressed concern over attempts to block roads to protest against NRC and CAA. He instead called for a united voice from a single platform that would register a stronger protest.

“This is not the right approach. If somebody has to register his/her protests against NRC or CAA, they are welcome to join our platform. Our CM has been relentlessly airing her grievance against the anti-people policies adopted by the Centre,” Hakim said.

On Saturday afternoon, cops stepped in at the protest site near New Market and forced the protesters who have been squatting right in the middle of the road to shift the platform to a corner. Later, the deputy commissioner of the central division held a meeting with OCs of Burrabazar, Posta, Maidan and New Market police stations to chalk out a plan to prevent activists from blocking roads to hold agitations.

The agitators on Hogg Street vowed to carry on with the protests for at least four days more. At Park Circus, the protests in the Maidan entered the 12th day on Saturday and showed no signs of abating. The participants there and at Ekbalpore, Zakaria Street and Howrah’s Pilkhana are eager to usher in Republic Day with flag hoisting in the morning and then travel to the nearest point between Golpark and Shyambazar to join the human chain.

“The human chain is an innovative idea to send out a message that we are united in our fight against the draconian CAA and the proposed NRC and NPR,” said Irfan Ali Taj, one of the organizers of the sit-in at Zakaria Street.

At Nawab Ali Park in Ekbalpore, protesters plan to bring out a peace rally in the evening that will have participation from people of all faiths. “We want a dialogue with every section of the society. It is important that the right message is sent out that it is not any particular community but the Constitution which is being threatened,” said Arshad Parvez Khan, one of the organizers.

At Howrah’s Pilkahana, members of the civil society are invited to speak on CAA and NRC to the gathering in the evening. “People should have a clear idea what they are protesting against. This is why we are organising awareness camps almost on a daily basis,” said one of the organizers.

At Park Circus Maidan, where the sit-in started on January 7, cultural programmes are scheduled in the evening. “Several students, artists and intellectuals are expected to arrive in the evening. We are going to sing patriotic songs and make posters,” said one of the organizers.

AHMEDABAD: It was a moment of elation for eight from Gujarat who were selected for Padma honours on the eve of the 70th Republic Day, on Saturday. The awardees said that the recognition will inspire them to work harder. While B V Doshi, selected for Padma Bhushan , could not be contacted, he had said in an earlier interview to TOI that his work is an extension of his life, philosophy, and dreams.

Prof Sudhir Jain, the founder-director of IIT-Gn, said that the prize is a great honour. “I am humbled. Much of my earthquake engineering work happened in Gujarat after 2001,” he said. “And I got a chance of institution building at IIT-Gn. Thus, I owe a lot to Gujarat.” He said the award was a recognition of his colleagues too.

Two stalwarts from performing arts have been selected for Padma awards. Shahbuddin Rathod, the renowned humourist from Thangadh , charted a new path in Gujarati dayro and narrative style. Yazdi Karanjia from Surat keeps the Parsi theatre tradition alive. “Today, the nation has appreciated me and my work in the fields of arts and culture,” Karanjia told TOI. “I humbly accept this and thank all my colleagues and family.”

Gaffur Bilakhia, a Vapi businessman, has been recognized for his contribution to trade and industries. Dr Gurdip Singh has been honoured for his contribution to medicine. Narayan J Joshi ‘Karayal’, the founder of Kachchi Sahitya Kala Sangh , works for the revival of Kachchi language.

Dr H M Desai, the vice-chancellor of Nadiad-based Dharmasinh Desai University (DDU), said that he will accept the award on the behalf of the entire staff of the university and the hospital his institution runs. “It’s collective work for excellence and we are hopeful that the recognition will bring focus to our initiatives,” he said.

Chennai: Police on Saturday solved the January 19 kidnap and extortion case of a businessman arresting four suspects. They seized Rs 3 lakh from the suspects.

The arrested were identified as Ganeshkumar, 32, of Thiruvottiyur, Anandaraj, 35, of Cheyyur in Kancheepuram district, and Mani, 28, and Perumal, 30, of Korukkupet. They were remanded in prison by a magistrate court.

Police said Suyambu, 50, a realtor from MKB Nagar, received a phone call a week ago and the person who spoke to him wanted him to construct a building at Vadaperumbakkam near Red Hills . Suyambu, who was out of town, later went to meet the caller and visit the site on his two-wheeler on January 19.

An investigation officer said that three men who showed him the plot allegedly took him in a car claiming that they would get the land documents from Koyambedu. However, when the car was near Koyambedu , they threatened Suyambu at knifepoint and demanded Rs 50 lakh to release him.

Suyambu was forced to call his friends and arrange the money. Later, the trio sent another person to receive Rs 6 lakh from Suyambu’s friend in Tondiarpet. After the money was received, the gang dropped Suyambu back at Vadaperumbakkam. Based on his complaint, the Red Hills police registered a case.

Some of the posters that became an instant hit at protest venues and beyond

KOLKATA: Defiant protesters are not only taking part in night vigils and rallies to voice their angst against CAA and NRC , they are also using satire and tongue-in-cheek slogans to back their demonstrations, using humour as a form of resistance.

Some posters and memes are witty — Bure din wapas kardo (return the bad days), read one of the them, mocking the BJP slogan of acche din (good days) before the 2014 elections — while some others convey a serious message about the unity of the country — jab Hindu Muslim razi toh kya karega Nazi — sending a subtle message to politicians to refrain from divisive politics.

When PM Narendra Modi arrived in Kolkata on January 11, protesters blocked all thoroughfares so that Modi could not reach Raj Bhavan. One of them read: Raasta bondho. Desh meramoter kaaj cholche (The road is shut. Nation rebuilding is underway).

On January 10, a young law student arrived at an anti-CAA protest on Mayo Road with a poster that read azadi mera dulha hai (azadi is my groom), bringing back memories of Bhagat Singh, who had told the British “Azadi meri dulhan hai (azadi is my bride)”. Another student carried a poster that read “yahan tobacco chorna itna mushkil hai aur yeh kehte hain desh chhor do’ (it is so difficult to quit chewing tobacco and they demand us to leave the country). It poked fun at politicians in the ruling regime who threaten to send people to Pakistan when they disagree with their discourse.

“Humour helps to connect. It also reduces fear because you are not scared of something that you laugh at. This is important as fear is being used as a tool to push back the protesters,” said Sreya Sengupta, a student of Presidency University who has been tickling the funny bone with her posters at several protests.

Earlier, political humour and satire was the preserve of big writers but today, even ordinary citizens are taking a dig at politicians due to the changing political climate and internet. Protesters said every time politicians speak, they provide enough content either due to the faux pas, slogans or flawed understanding of the country and its people.

A young man in Kolkata started attending protests wearing symbols of most religions painted on his face and attires of most faiths after PM Modi in one of his political rallies in Jharkhand said the protesters can be identified by their attire. “I am Ram Bismil Singh Robert,” he says while holding aloft a poster saying “Pehchan Kaun? (identify who I am)”.

Many people also feel humour is an important release valve and coping mechanism under a “majoritarian rule”. “Using humour is also an attempt by citizens to counter balance prejudice and bigotry and poke fun at them,” said Prasanta Dasgupta, a political scientist.

Rudrapur: Nearly a week after police managed to rescue Rudrapur Municipal Corporation councillor Amit Mishra from Ghaziabad, four men have now been arrested for allegedly abducting him. Three other members of the gang are still on a run, say police officials.

SSP Barinderjit Singh said that police received a tip-off that seven accused were going from Baghpat to Baithak in Uttar Pradesh (UP) in two vehicles. The police teams cordoned off the area and blocked these two cars at an underpass at the peripheral expressway. While the police managed to nab four persons, three others managed to flee the spot.

The arrested have been identified as Rinku Kumar (30), a resident of Ganesh Nagar in Delhi; Chetan Kumar (32) of Trilokpuri in Delhi; Gautam Jatav (23) of Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh; and Abrar Ansari (24), of Fazalpur Mehraula in Rudrapur. Three other accused who are still on the loose are — Sandeep Kumar, Harendra Prakash, and Rohan Bhati. They all are Baghpat (UP) residents.

During investigation, the police found that the accused are history-sheeters and had looted two petrol pumps in UP and Uttarakhand in the first week of January. The police also recovered a double barrel gun and the car used for kidnapping the accused.

To recall, Mishra (alias Bittu), RMC councillor from Bhoot Bangla ward number 21, was kidnapped from Rampur Road on January 15 by six people, who intercepted his bike, overpowered him and pulled him into their car. They later demanded a ransom of Rs 20 lakh for his release.

According to police, the victim’s mother, Sarvesh Mishra, lodged a complaint with police on January 16. Several teams were immediately set up to ensure safe recovery of the victim. When the kidnappers realised that they were being followed by police, they escaped on the night of January 18 after freeing the victim at PVR Mall in Rajnagar Extension, Ghaziabad, from where police rescued the councillor.

Asha Devi was in city along with her husband, Badrinath Singh and lawyer Seema Kushwaha for a flag hoisting ceremony on Republic Day.

Kushwaha added that people, who are talking about human rights of convicts, should study the definition of human rights as these convicts did extremely heinous crime.

“It has been seven years but crimes haven't decreased. Even though there were several amendments done, it has been useless. Government is insensitive towards the females which is 49% of the country’s population. We are hopeful that the Article 72 will be amended,” she added.

Asha Devi, who is hopeful that convicts will be executed on February 1, added that in a span of three decades she has seen only one rape convict being hanged and she has decided that she will continue to fight for rights of several other Nirbhayas.

“Each month 6500 rapes take place in our country how can it be expected that the country will progress if society is not safe how will country be safe? I want to see how much court gives right. I am expecting Supreme Court to come up with guidelines soon and it's not just one Nirbhaya but for several others,” said father of Nirbhaya.

Parents of Nirbhaya suggested that in case of rape, or gang rape the family shouldn’t hide the victim as it wasn't the fault of the girl but that of those criminals. Parents should support the girl and the society will support. They also urged not to differentiate between children on the basis of gender.

Mudar Patherya’s copy of the Constitution; (L) Utsav Parekh keeps his copy on the centre table at his Sarat Bo... Read More

KOLKATA: At least two photo-lithographic reproductions of the Constitution of the Republic of India , which few in Kolkata knew about, have suddenly become the city’s most prized assets with people from all walks of life, castes, creeds and religions swearing to protect the Constitution and the values it upholds. One of the 1,000 photo-lithographic reproductions of the document is in the possession of a communications professional, and the other is with a businessman.

The two have, for over two-and-a-half decades, had the document that articulated the idea of India in its infancy. But never has the document been more relevant than now. In the past couple of months, the Constitution has emerged as the bedrock of protests against attempts to redefine India. On Sunday, women protesting at the multiple ‘Shaheen Baghs’ in the city will recite the Constitution, as will Christian priests and parishes in churches after the morning mass. Also on that day, which happens to be the 70th anniversary of the Constitution, 14 individuals, including actors Aparna Sen, Parambrata Chatterjee and Dhritiman Chatterjee, and singers Rupam Islam, Usha Uthup and Anjan Dutt, will recite segments of the Preamble for a video to be uploaded on social media. A student will conclude the video with the final two words, “this Constitution”.

“We had learned the Constitution in civics and knew the Preamble by heart as students. In the later years, few remember the words that encapsulated the idea of a nation. That was true till the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests kicked off. The Preamble and the Constitution is suddenly in currency because people feel what the government is trying to push through is against the spirit of the Preamble,” said Mudar Patherya, who had bought the photo-lithograph for Rs 3,000 from antiquarian Rupnarayan Shastri in 1988.

He said the Constitution, to him, is like the Quran and the Preamble, the Surah al Fateha, which is effectively the essence of the holy book in a nutshell. It is the heart of the Quran, something that every Muslim gets to learn by heart as a child. “Just like the Surah al Fateha, the Preamble could take a lifetime to decode,” he explained.

To Utsav Parekh, who got the photo-lithograph in 1995, the Constitution is the genesis of how we live as citizens of India. “To me, this is a law book. It tells you what the Indian society is, how one should live, what are one’s rights, duties and obligations,” he said.

Parekh felt a churn is natural in a dynamic world. But if a change affects a large section of the population, one must be careful.

“The framers of the Constitution had foresight. For 70 years, it has been India’s guiding star. I hope it remains so for generations to come,” he said.

Patherya said a line in the Preamble — “Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship” — is its show-piece line that other countries should try to emulate.

AHMEDABAD: Mahesh Panchal, a resident of Sharna Residency in Naroda, lodged complaint for cheating and offences under the IT Act at Naroda police station.

Panchal stated that he obtained a credit card of a private bank in October 2019. On October 24, he got a call from a person who identified himself as a bank employee. The man told Panchal that a verification procedure had to be done for the card to be activated. The man first took his card number and then the three digit CVV number.

The man then asked him for the one-time password (OTP) that was sent to his mobile phone, so that the card could be activated. According to the FIR, as Panchal gave him the OTP, Rs 45,907 was spent on the card.

Naroda police officials said they are tracing the number from which Panchal got the call and would soon arrest the perpetrator.

NEW DELHI: The video clip of a controversial speech made by a JNU student at the AMU campus surfaced on social media on Friday night, triggering a row over Shaheen Bagh . BJP’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra shared the clip on Twitter on Saturday.Addressing a press conference later, he called it an “open call for jihad and finishing the sovereignty of the country.” Patra had initially said the speech was made at Shaheen Bagh but when corrected he said the venue didn’t make the issue less grave.In the video, the student, Sharjeel Imam — who had earlier figured in reports as one of the organisers of the Shaheen Bagh protest — is heard telling the crowd that Muslims can cut off the entire Northeast from the rest of India by blocking Chicken’s Neck (Siliguri Corridor) which has a predominantly Muslim population. “It was stated in the speech that cutting off Assam from India is our responsibility which means that it is the responsibility of Shaheen Bagh, and the thought process of Shaheen Bagh is to finish India’s sovereignty and cut off Assam and the Northeast from India,” Patra said calling the speech seditious.Amid clapping and chants of ‘Allahu Akbar’, Imam was seen talking about anti-CAA rallies. Giving the example of such rallies in Bihar, he said: “Every day, one or two big rallies are being organised. For example, in Kanhaiya Kumar’s rallies there were 5 lakh people. I have said it earlier also that if we have an organised group of 5 lakh people, we can permanently cut off Northeast from India. If not permanently, then for at least one or more months. Dump so much debris on the tracks and roads that they (government) will need one month to clear,” he says.“Cutting off Assam is our responsibility,” he exhorts the crowd. “Only when Assam is cut off from the country, they (government) will listen to us. You are aware of the condition of Muslims in Assam where CAA and NRC have been implemented. People are being pushed into detention centres. A bloodbath is going on there.” He expressed concern about the plight of Bengalis, irrespective of their faith, in Assam. “If we want to help Assam, we need to close the roads for Army and supplies. It can be cut off because the Chicken Neck is dominated by Muslims. It is the responsibility of leaders and scholars to put the anger of the public to productive use.”Highlighting this part of the speech, Patra asked whether productive use of anger referred to destroying the country and breaking it into multiple parts. “Rahul Gandhi and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had four years ago backed the JNU ‘tukde-tukde gang’. The dream of the cousin brothers (Rahul and Kejriwal) is reflecting in Shaheen Bagh. Manish Sisodia stands with Shaheen Bagh,” Patra said, asking whether Rahul and Kejriwal would still stand with such a call.“Imam is one of the coordinators of the Shaheen Bagh protest. Rather than being just a geographical location that it was a few days ago, Shaheen Bagh has become a thought process which is being emulated across many places in the country,” Patra said.Patra alleged that Shaheen Bagh was overflowing with anti-nationals. “Shaheen Bagh is a poisonous idea,” he said adding that the protest site, which also has many children, is filling innocent hearts with hatred. “The conspiracy was clearly visible in the speech to cut off the Northeast from the rest of the country by using the predominantly Muslim population living in Chicken’s Neck,” he said. “This is a classical call for jihad,” stressed Patra, comparing the viral speech with attempts witnessed across the world to establish the Caliphate and destroy democracy.The BJP functionary also condemned the attack on journalists on Friday at the protest site.TOI tried to reach out to Imam but failed to elicit any response from him.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73626703,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-91887,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/call-to-cut-off-ne-fromindia-is-jihad-says-patra/articleshow/73621400.cms

SURAT: A group of family , friends and community members of a 14-year-old schoolgirl gheraoed Varachha police station on Saturday to demand that she be rescued from her abductors immediately.

The 70-odd people ended their demonstration after approximately 90 minutes when police officials assured them of strict action in the matter.

The family members submitted a memorandum at the office of district collector complaining of inaction by police, which also mentioned the role of accused Kamlesh Parmar, 25, and others in the abduction of the girl. The girl had left home on January 8 at 7am to go to school, but she neither reached school nor returned home.

The family had lodged a complaint of abduction at Varachha police station the same day against Kamlesh, who earlier lived in neighbouring house.

Police have booked Kamlesh Parmar for allegedly abducting the girl. Police found her documents in the house of a Parmar’s relative at Vashingpura village of Gir Somnath district in Saurashtra .

“My daughter’s Aadhaar Card, birth certificate and school leaving certificate were found in the house of Parmar’s elder sister, but police didn’t take any action against her. Police have specific information about people who had helped Parmar financially but they are not being nabbed,” father of the girl alleged.

“We are taking action to trace the girl and nab the accused. A team led by a police sub-inspector is in Saurashtra,” said C K Patel, assistant sub-inspector, A division.

NEW DELHI: Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), the group organising the protests at Jamia Millia Islamia , has condemned the attempts to portray Sharjeel Imam as their leader. A group of alumni of JNU’s Centre of Historical Studies (CHS), where Imam is a student, has also condemned his “divisive” statement.

In their statement, JCC said that since the beginning of the popular and leaderless movement, individuals have been repeatedly targeted by the state, media and the government “in a bid to delegitimise and break up the protests. Students from Jamia and AMU have been charged with baseless cases, locals have been accused of everything from bribery to terrorism, and hate campaigns have been initiated against different people.”

They said the latest attempt was to accuse Imam of sedition by presenting him as a “leader” of the movement.

“JCC wishes to state that neither Imam nor any other individual is a recognised as a “leader” in the ongoing protests, and any attempt to attach the broad movement to individual leaders is only a strategy to derail the movement. To the best of our knowledge, Imam is currently associated neither with the protests in Jamia nor with the one in Shaheen Bagh ,” JCC, comprising of multiple student groups of Jamia, said in its statement.

Stating that “while we do not agree with Imam’s political positions and do not endorse him in any way, we nevertheless stand in solidarity with him as he faces incarceration for an alleged act of sedition.”

At JNU, where Imam is currently enrolled as a student, 13 alumni and students of CHS in a signed statement said that “the Indian Constitution and its values are our beacon. We condemn this person’s attempt to misuse the anti-CAA protest — a democratic one at the core — to push a divisive agenda, as his alleged video suggests. JNU stands for a united and harmonious India.”

Representative image

PANAJI: The public health department (PHD) is in the process of amending the rules, after it amended and notified a circular for executing bonds with modified terms of service for undergradudate and postgraduate students of Goa Medical College (GMC) and Goa Dental College (GDC)

Though the new guidelines that were included in the circular issued in April 2019 reduced the bond period from three years to one for post graduate students, the corresponding notification in the rules was not made.

“The rules for PG courses are being amended, but no rules were in force for undergraduates of GMC and GDC,” said an official.

The circular, with the new guidelines that were issued last year, mandated that undergraduate and postgraduate students serve a bond of one year for each programme.

“The reduction of the bond period from three years to one year has to be reflected in the rules,” he said.

Under the old rules, he said there was no provision to give an exemption from serving the bond but, ironically, in the past, many students left after completing their PG to take up further studies, but they didn’t come back to offer their services.

“Many students used further studies as an alibi to escape from serving their bond period. On being relieved, they would not come back even after completing their course,” he said.

Under the new guidelines, there is a provision to offer temporary relief from the bond, if any student wants to take up a course or pursue further studies after PG, but subject to the condition that the student gives in a bank guarantee.

“In case the student does not return to serve their bond period after completing his course, the bank guarantee stands forfeited with no notice,” he said.

There is also a provision to penalise students who resign without completing the course, or fail to serve the bond. MD/MS/Diploma/MDS student will be liable to pay a penalty of Rs 50 lakh, and students of MBBS/BDS/allied health sciences (AHS), Rs 10 lakh, on failure to put in the service.

Temporary exemption from the bond, however, shall not be granted for short term fellowship courses of less than one year, or to attend workshops or other training programmes.

375,['26/01/2020'],Why our love affair with cricket will never grow stale,"This story is from January 26, 2020

What each of the panelists in the ‘Cricket: The Spirit of the Game’ session had in common was that neither of them could convert passion into competence. “I tried the hardest to the least effect,” said Gideon Haigh, widely regarded as the finest cricket writer of the day, and among the best in the history of the game. “As a child, I wanted to play cricket very badly. And that’s what happened as I grew up – I ended up playing it badly,” confessed Shashi Tharoor.

“Unlike my father, I had everything going for me; I had the best equipment, the best coaching. But I realised cricket doesn’t run in the blood,” admitted Rajdeep Sardesai.

Sardesai’s father, of course, was the famous Dilip, the first – and till date only – Goa-born cricketer to play for India. His story is full of the romance of cricket. “Before M S Dhoni there was Dilip Sardesai,” said the proud son of a batsman who loved playing in the Caribbean. “He didn’t see a cricket pitch till he was 17, and he learnt cricket from the village tailor, who himself learnt it from listening to the radio. His is a remarkable story.”

For Haigh, cricket is the gift that keeps on giving. “In some ways, I’m still that small boy experiencing for the first time that photo of Victor Trumper jumping out to drive – it’s a symbol of expressiveness, freedom, élan, elegance and athleticism,” he said, with more than a hint of nostalgia.

The career and life of Shane Warne, long retired but still as fascinating, also received an airing. “Growing up in Australia in the 1970s and 1980s, you were told by old stagers how magical leg-spin was, but you never saw it – and if you did see a leg-spinner, you would see him being smashed out of the park,” Haigh recalled.

“We didn’t believe it was still possible to see leg-spin but then this chap rolls up, and suddenly we see what we were always told leg-spin was – a species of magic. I feel blessed to have lived in the Warne era, to have seen what leg-spin was all about.” And how could a discussion on cricket today not mention Virat Kohli? Haigh spoke about his versatility and adaptability, and the fact that Kohli has not only succeeded in but dominated all formats of the game. “He is unique in the annals of the game – we’re living through the Kohli era.”

Still, cricket’s more than a game (to paraphrase C L R James). For Haigh, stepping on to the field is panacea to all the ills that afflict it. “It’s rejuvenating and reassuring to play it, to remind myself of the exquisite physical sensation of it, and the camaraderie,” he shared. And for Sardesai, a visit to the Mumbai maidan works wonders. “Whenever I feel depressed, I go back there, just to see the kids playing and their infectious energy. That will remain forever.”

Digambar Behera

CHANDIGARH: Dr Digambar Behera , senior professor, department of pulmonary medicine, PGI, has been chosen for the Padma Shri award under the category of medicine this year.

Dr Behera was given extension for two years after he superannuated in 2018. He had also been nominated as the director of PGI in 2011, when he made it to the top three contenders.

Dr Behera, who belongs to a village in Cuttack, Odisha, comes from a middle-class family. His parents were not literate, and he was the first amongst two siblings to make it to the field of medicine. The journey for him till he made it to PGI has been tough. “I used to walk barefoot to attend my school located some 4-5 km away from home as I had no shoes. While studying I also used to help my father in agricultural activities,” said Dr Behera. There were times when the pulmonologist had to borrow coat during the winters when he was in PGI for his post-graduation.

Dr Behera has now come a long way. He is the chairman of the national task force of National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme. He is also the chairman of a few divisions of the ICMR-formed Indian Tuberculosis Research Consortium that conducts research and plans activities for new diagnosis and medicines for tuberculosis.

Having spent 42 years in PGI, Dr Behera gives the credit of his accomplishments to his teachers and the faculty of his department. “I had been inspired by my department head Prof S K Malik, who was wheelchair-bound. He used to give me research ideas related to the field. My first research was on chutta/homemade (reverse) smoking by fishermen in Odisha. It was known that it causes mouth cancer but nothing was done on its effect on lungs. I conducted lung and other function tests on them,” said Dr Behera.

Dr Behera believes that one should be determined, remain focused and work till one breathes his last. “I will be turning 67 soon. But this honour bestowed on me has encouraged me to work more towards TB elimination and lung cancer treatment.”

Box:

Last year, Prof Jagat Ram , director, PGI, was awarded Padma Shri. Prof Yogesh Chawla, former director, PGI, and Prof Amod Gupta, former sub dean, PGIMER, have also received Padma Shri earlier.

378,['26/01/2020'],Dateline Northeast: Time to move away from stereotypes,"This story is from January 26, 2020

How does a writer from the Northeast – a straitjacketing descriptor that does no justice to its people – engage and interact with the mainstream? This was one of the topics touched upon in the session, ‘The Rivers, The Sky, The Self’, on day three of the Jaipur Literature Festival.

“I don’t have a problem with being slotted as a Northeastern writer – it’s better than being recognised as a Japanese and being asked for my passport!” said writer Easterine Kire, partly in jest. Indeed, Kire’s life and ancestry embodies the diversity that exists in the region; a grandmother from Meghalaya, a grand-uncle married into Mizoram. A Naga herself, she has friends from Manipur.

“I’m proud to be Northeastern but my Assamese identity is more important to me. Because, had I not learnt Assamese culture, I would not be here today,” shared poet and journalist Mridul Haloi.

Aruni Kashyap, writer, translator and teacher, described the region as “polyphonic”, but that polyphony doesn’t reflect in media reportage. “We don’t see that diversity of voices, and it’s similar to how ‘African’ writers are portrayed in the West – there are so many more voices, stories, representations from the Northeast,” he contended.

Then, of course, there are the conflicts that have, unhappily, blighted this corner of India. They have also, equally unfortunately, received too many column inches in the national media. Kire was blunt about her objections. “There’s one reviewer who’s unhappy that I don’t write about violence!

“Don’t use stereotypes to try and understand us, come to the Northeast to find out about our real selves, because the fake is destroying us.”

For pretty much every writer in the Northeast, the geography, and their ethnicity, forms a crucial part of their writings. Haloi’s relationship, for example, is more personal. “I have my own river, the Pagladia, with which I have spent a lot of time, on its banks. I believe the river can recognise me, and I talk to him,” he told the audience. “One day, it asked me, ‘Would you like to live with me?’ to which I replied, ‘I already am!’

“Whenever someone asks me about rivers, I am reminded of the Pagladia.” Indeed, rivers, Kire adds, are important to the imagination and soul of the people here.

BENGALURU: Facebook is the “high school reunion from Hell”. Twitter is the “hosepipe of hatred”. Instagram is “Twitter for people who can’t or won’t read”. WhatsApp is the “official disinformation channel”. These are all descriptions of social media – on social media. And the love-hate relationships that we have with this latest form of self-expression is both bewildering and addictive.

There have been reams written about the nature of our love for social media - the allure of self-presentation, the dopamine rush with every comment or like on a post, and the transformation of our very lives as social media performance.

All that is true – and social media is often depressing, frustrating, invidious. Women tend to face horrendous abuse and threats of rape and mutilation. Political arguments lose all nuance and turn into slugfests and shouting matches. Language is often vile. And the other aspect, that of one’s circle of friends and peers, turns on exclusivity, exotic holidays, the preciousness of precocious children – all leading to FOMO, the fear of missing out – a word that the Oxford Dictionary added way back in 2013.

But.

If you can accept that you will never have a life as interesting as your friends on Instagram or Facebook, that you will never know more than the economist or historian on Twitter, and you’re prepared to stay away from people you interact with on a regular basis in real life while on social media, there is so much scope for learning new things, to be entertained, to be amazed and to be provoked into thought.

It’s how you discover that the late Sultan Qaboos of Oman was a great fan of British light opera and Gilbert and Sullivan - and one of the reasons he led a coup against his father was that his father had stormed into his room and smashed his favourite record (The Pirates of Penzance). It’s finding out that both Gordon Greenidge and Vivian Richards made their test debuts here in this city, in 1974 – and Greenidge became the first West Indian to score a test century on debut while overseas. Or that we use the ‘x’ as the multiplication sign because of the efforts of a clergyman named William Oughtred , back in 1631. Or that the Marathi broadcaster and novelist Venu Chitale began her career at the BBC in 1940 as secretary to author George Orwell. Or that there is a kind of mollusc called the disco clam which uses a system of flashing lights to protect itself from predators. Its finding pictures of “beauties from Lucknow”, dating back to 1874. It’s finding out that Mary Burchell , an author of more than 110 Mills & Boon romance novels, used the money she made to save Jewish families from the Nazis before World War II.

And there’s subject-focused social media – virtual gatherings of old film fans, antiquarians, bibliophiles, mathematicians, astronomers, nature lovers – whose posts renew interest in things that you had hoped you’d left behind you, which went under the stultifying names of mathematics and biology and physics from your days in school or college; or bring to your attention films you should be seeing or books you should be reading - classics that no longer are on bestseller lists or the box office charts. And when you go from reading about books to reading them, and talking about them, from watching clips to watching a long forgotten classic that still retains its charm, your life is enriched.

Yes, posting a photo of yourself in exotic surroundings, looking as good as you can, artfully enhanced by tints and filters, and seeing the likes pour in can be immensely satisfying. So is making a smart remark about the state of the nation or the world, stimulating a comment chain a hundred posts long. But unless you’re a celebrity, with people waiting to engage with you, hanging on your every image or utterance, this is not going to happen. And when it does, it is usually accompanied by hateful remarks, ad-hominem insults, and general pettiness.

But if you are content with having fifty friends or followers – of which 40 may be bots, but are willing to follow hundreds of people who have interesting things to say, if you’re willing to prune your friends’ lists and following lists regularly and often, social media can be so rewarding. But if you keep trying to make that popular post, that viral video, that great selfie, you’ve just ended up “public, like a frog”, telling your name the livelong June, to an admiring – or otherwise – bog.

A team of FSL experts, Surat police and DGVCL has started investigation into the textile market fire

SURAT: Surat Urban Development Authority (SUDA) sealed Raghuvir Celeum Textile Market on Puna-Kumbhariya Road here on Saturday.

SUDA officials said the structure of the textile market has become weak due to the massive fire that razed for more than 32 hours since Tuesday last. The entire market has been sealed for an indefinite period. A notice has been put up at the market to prevent entry of people.

Official sources said the building requires structural stability report from a government approved agency. SUDA chairman Banchhanidhi Pani told TOI, “The market has been sealed for an indefinite period, till structural stability of the building is established. The building may be demolished.”

The massive fire at Raghuvir Celeum Textile Market broke out on the early morning hours of January 21. The entire A and B wings of the market were gutted in the fire. It took more than 32 hours for the firefighters to extinguish the fire.

A team of Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), city police and Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Limited (DGVCL) have started a joint investigation into the textile market fire. FSL experts have collected samples from the spot and the entire building was videographed. The DGVCL has carried out MRI of electricity metres inside the building and transformers in that area to know about overloading and illegal drawing of power in the building.

Pani said, “We will know the exact cause of the fire once the FSL submit its report. Action will be taken against whoever is responsible for the fire.”

An officer of SUDA said, “Raghuvir Celeum Textile Market fire is not a normal incident. There are doubts over it. It appears to be someone’s mischief for taking benefit of insurance claim. The entire building was insured.”

Vijai Sardesai

PANAJI: President of Goa Forward Party ( GFP ) Vijai Sardesai on Saturday demanded that the state government should file an FIR on the recommendation of Goa Lokayukta in renewal of 88 mining leases.

Sardesai told mediapersons that based on Karnataka Lokayukta, BJP had asked its chief minister to resign in Karnataka. But in Goa, BJP is saying that Lokayukta report is only recommendary.

“This government has become thick skinned as they have 27 MLAs,” Sardesai said, adding, “100% FIR should be filed, and it goes without saying. If government does not file FIR then it is like a banana republic.”

On Thursday, chief minister Pramod Sawant had said that no charges of corruption have been made in the Lokayukta report on renewal of mining leases against former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar or any of the officers named in it.

Sawant had said that as there was a need for resumption of mines, the then government had decided to renew the 88 leases.

Lokayukta justice P K Misra had recommended to the state government to conduct a CBI inquiry and file an FIR against Parsekar, former mines secretary Pawan Kumar Sain and former mines director Prasanna Acharya for alleged “corruption” and “criminal conspiracy” in renewing leases of 88 mines between November 2014 and January 2015.

Misra had also said that Sain and Acharya should not hold any offices.

Soon after Lokayukta submitted the report to the state government, Sawant had said that it was only a recommendatory body and it was for the government to act on it.

“The government has a right to accept or reject it. After studying the report, the government will take necessary action,” he had told TOI on Tuesday.

CHENNAI: A two-year-old boy was run over by a private van near Gummidipoondi on Friday evening.

The deceased Rishwanth had accompanied his mother Gayathri, 26, to pick up her niece’s daughter Sathvika, 4, coming from school in a van. As the van used to drop her at Siru Puzhal Pet near Gummidipoondi, Gayathri was waiting for her. Soon after the van arrived, Gayathri rushed towards the door holding Rishwanth. Sathvika came out greeting Rishwanth and Gayathri, who took Sathvika on her lap but failed to focus on Rishwanth.

Witnesses said the boy walked towards the rear wheel of the van and when the driver moved the vehicle, he ran over the child killing him on the spot. Stunned, Gayathri raised an alarm and neighbours rushed the boy to the Ponneri Government Hospital where he was declared brought dead.

Police said Rishwanth was the son of Shanmugam, 36, and Gayathri from Reddypalayam near Kavarapettai in Gummidipoondi. They lived as a joint family with Shanmugam’s brother Haridoss and his wife. The incident happened when Gayathri had gone to receive Haridoss’ daughter, Sathvika, an LKG student, who came from school in the van hired to drop students.

The Kavarapettai police registered a case and arrested van driver Balamurugan of Thumbakkam near Gummidipoondi. He was booked under IPC Section 304 (A) (death caused due to negligent driving).

NEW DELHI: As BJP and Aam Aadmi Party continue to spar about the quality of education in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal invited Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday to visit a Delhi government school and see for himself the transformation that has taken place in the last five years. Shah has been punching holes in AAP ’s claims of having transformed the education sector and insisting at public meetings that the condition of Delhi schools had only worsened.“We are in favour of education being an important part of the political system and people should cast their votes on the basis of whether a government has worked to improve school education infrastructure,” Kejriwal said at a press conference. “This is what will take the country forward. There should be no dirty politics around schools and education.”The AAP convenor described as false all the declarations made by Shah about Delhi’s education system and schools being faulty and urged him to keep education out of political rivalries. “Our model of education is lauded not only in the nation, but across the entire world,” Kejriwal said.The Delhi CM urged Shah to accompany him to a Delhi government school of his choice. “We have never said that everything has been done. There is still much that needs to be done. But a lot of improvements has been made in the government schools,” Kejriwal said. “We have tried to rectify in the last five years the wrongs of the last 70 years. And I credit the progress in the government schools to the efforts of 16 lakh students of these schools. I also give credit to the parents of those students for the improvements. These improvements are also a result of the efforts of 60,000-65,000 teachers and principals working in the Delhi government schools.”Kejriwal said that the Union home minister’s remarks mocked the efforts of the students and their guardians.“His statements have insulted the 16 lakh students and their parents, the 65,000 teachers. The hard work of those students, their parents and their teachers made them achieve 96% pass result in Class XII,” Kejriwal said and asked Shah “not to rebuke the students, parents and teachers for their hard work”.The AAP chief pointed out that more than 400 Delhi government school students had cleared the tough IIT entrance exam and the medical joint entrance exams. He then dared Shah to give the example of even one school in a BJP-served state where a similar improvement had been recorded.“I would like you to improve the schools in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, or even the municipal schools in Delhi, and then talk about the lack in our model of education and how your schools are better than ours.

389,['26/01/2020'],Can news coverage tick to heartbeats of poetry?,"This story is from January 26, 2020

BENGALURU: No, you can neither mix nor match news and poetry . Or, can you? Strange as the hypothesis might sound, it was part of the question a nerdy teenager asked at the Times literature festival a couple of years ago. Do reporters show a poet’s emotional response in situations? Do poets feel compelled to react to breaking news? Does the language in one form inspire or influence the other?

Establishing a connection between poetry and news seemed absurd to the couple of authors around then, but I found out a year later that there was ample reason for suspending the scepticism. Practitioners of both forms of writing had considered the idea. In 2009, the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, commissioned 31 authors and poets to cover the day’s news and ended up offering an astonishingly unique fare. Except for a couple of sections, the entire newspaper consisted of articles and – er, poems – by these writers. Hebrew poet Roni Somek presented the weather report in a sonnet with the lines: “Summer is the pencil/ that is least sharp/ in the seasons’ pencil case.” Children’s book author Avri Herling described a sedate day on the stock exchange as: “Everything’s okay. Everything’s like usual. Yesterday trading ended. Everything’s okay. The economists went to their homes, the laundry is drying on the lines, dinners are waiting in place…” He didn’t miss mentioning the day’s closing figures on the Dow Jones and Nasdaq, though. There were a few literary gems too, among them novelist David Grossman (Booker-winner for “A Horse Walks Into A Bar”) who spent a night in a children’s drug rehab centre.

In 2010, the University of Oregon brought together poet laureate Paulann Petersen and Pulitzer-winning journalist and poet Don Colbum to discuss various aspects of poetry and journalism and whether the twain can meet. It included a reference to the famous lines of William Carlos Williams in “Asphodel, That Greeny Flower”: “It is difficult/ to get the news from poems/ yet men die miserably every day/ for lack/ of what is found there.”

Paulann traced the essential difference between the two, pointing out that journalism is news for a majority and poetry is news by epiphany. On the face of it, a poem and a news report are different: if one records a soft whisper, the other captures pandemonium in parliament; if for one a blooming flower is momentous, for the other, only a typhoon can be eventful; one uplifts the mood with a lover’s silent smile and the other celebrates with a thousand fist-pumps. Agreed a poem comes to live with us in our private space, persuading us to look at the world through our little window. And that it uses the evocative power of metaphors, similes and hyperbole to stir our thoughts and feelings. On the contrary, news brings the “here and now” to our doorstep, employing a set structure and familiar expressions. Often, clichés are the pizza boys of news delivery.

Poems as we know rely on creative tropes. And because the scope of expression in a poem is so vast, poets can go so far to vehemently disagree with others on what constitutes an impactful line. Dom Moraes, then only 16, wrote a letter to the TOI in 1954, in reaction to a comment on the most beautiful line ever written. What does the adjective imply, he asks. If it meant “the architectonics of verse, then the loveliest line ever written is to be found somewhere in the collected works of Alexander Pope, Edith Sitwell and Wallace Stevens, which I do not believe in the least…” He concludes, saying “there is no universal rule applicable to the appreciation of poetry and the question should not be discussed as if there were”. Dom was among the few poets Coleridge and Walt Whitman who engaged in active journalism. His despatches from conflict zones, his interviews and biographies bear testimony to sparkling prose that took birth in a poetic mind.

In an email interview with me after he won the Pulitzer for poetry in 2014, Bengaluru-born Vijay Seshadri said he was fascinated by the historical narrative and the emotional depths that poetry could explore. His “The Disappearances”, which deals with an undisclosed catastrophe, was published after the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Centre. Although it wasn’t specifically written to memorialize or recall the tragedy, readers then connected it with the feeling of loss.

Journalism works to the ticks of the clock, poetry chimes to the beats of the heart. A poem nudges a person’s deepest thoughts, making us observe life, things and ideas in a different light. If some news reports absorbed the soul of poetry, they could be richer. Be it about the hustle and bustle of everyday life or earth-shaking events, that approach could help shape our consciousness.

Parrikar was four-time chief minister of the state and former defence minister.Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that he was delighted that Parrikar has been given Padma Bhushan award posthumously. “A tribute to the great visionary leader of the masses,” he said.Parrikar passed away on March 17, last year, after an almost year-long battle with cancer. Introduced into BJP by former Goa RSS chief Subhash Velingkar in the late eighties, Parrikar was hesitant at the start.He turned out to be a top political strategist, representing the Panaji constituency uninterrupted from 1994 till his death.Briefly, when he resigned to become the defence minister, he got his aide elected as the MLA and won when he returned to the state in 2017. Parrikar formed the first BJP government in the state in 2000.At a time when BJP had just 10 MLAs, he stitched together a coalition, and two years later, formed the government again with just 13 MLAs in a House of 40.In 2012, following five years of Congress governance, Parrikar won a majority on his own for the first time with 21 MLAs. How a swayamsewak rose to such great heights in Goa with a significant minority population would have surprised many. Parrikar, after all, was the one who led around 700 kar sevaks from Goa during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.A non-conventional politician, his style of governance projected simplicity and middle-class values. He became chief minister at the age of 43 in 2000, and came up with schemes — computers for students, direct money transfer to beneficiaries, old age pension and health insurance — which were later introduced by the Modi government at the Centre.“Manohar bhai was a colossal leader, who worked tirelessly for the people till his last breath. His contributions to the state and country have touched upon every strata of society and through his vision, he was instrumental in making people’s lives better. He was a people’s man,” said BJP state president Sadanand Tanavade.Reacting to the announcement, Parrikar's son Utpal tweeted, ""Thank You Prime Minister @narendramodi ji and HM @AmitShah ji for bestowing Padma Bhushan award in recognition of my father @manoharparrikar‘s contribution towards public service and whatever small part he played towards nation building.”“This will be inspirational to every Goan, including myself, that although we come from a very small state like Goa we can contribute immensely towards nation!,” Utpal said.The Centre also announced president’s police medal for gallantry to deputy superintendent of police Sammy Tavares and president police medal for meritorious service to police sub-inspector Dattaram Raut.Fire officer Dnyaneshwar Sawant has been awarded president's medal for meritorious service.John Aguiar, company commander of Home Guards, Panaji division, has been awarded the President's home guard and civil defence medal for distinguished services and Raulu Gawas section leader home guard and Santan Francis Dias, home guard volunteer have been awarded home guards and civil defence medal for meritorious service.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73630056,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-272211,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/padma-bhushan-for-parrikar-cm-says-tribute-to-a-visionary/articleshow/73621421.cms

Panaji: Congress on Saturday condemned the state government’s decision to conduct written test for recruitment of lower division clerks for the directorate of women & child development on Republic Day . Almost 8,000 candidates are scheduled to appear for the written test from 9.30am to 5pm on Sunday . This exposes BJP’s scant respect and lack of reverence for the memorable day, a Congress statement reads.

“The government has displayed once again its disrespect to this historic day where the sacred document of the ‘Constitution’ was instituted by the Union of India,” Congress’ media convener Trajano D'Mello said.

CHENNAI: A 50-year-old Sri Lankan Tamil murdered his sister suspecting that she concealed a liquor bottle, at Valasaravakkam on Friday night. Police said Guhadasan attacked his mother and nephew too when they tried to prevent him from attacking his sister. They arrested Guhadasan. A police officer said Guhadasan was under the influence of alcohol. The deceased R Tharageshwari, a widow from Sri Lanka, was staying at a rented house in Velan Nagar with her mother S Vedanayaki, 81, and son R Athishan, said police.

Police said Guhadasan came to the city from Sri Lanka 10 days ago to visit Sabarimala. After returning, he consumed liquor and got into an argument with Tharageshwari after she allegedly hid a liquor bottle. He stabbed her multiple times with a kitchen knife. Athishan, who tried to rescue her, also received knife wounds on his chest. Vedanayaki suffered a hip fracture as Guhadasan pushed her during the fight.

A crowd gathers as the tiger was spotted on the highway

NAGPUR: Fear gripped over a dozen villages in Tumsar range of Bhandara forest division after a tiger attacked three persons on the Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh border around noon on Saturday.

One of the victims had a lucky escape in Binaki village after the tiger had a him in a tight grip. But a big crowd, which had gathered at the spot, pelted stones and managed to drive the tiger away. Not many forest and police officials were present to control the restive crowd.

The injured persons have been identified as Shankar Turkar (40) from Pandharwani in MP, Chhotelal Thakre (35), a resident of Gondekhari (Bhandara), and Virendra Sahare (45) from Sindpuri (Tumsar). Videos of the tiger crossing a road, striding across farms and attacking a man was widely circulated on the social media.

All were admitted to a primary health centre at Sihora from where they were shifted to Bhandara district hospital. On January 18, one more person named Ganesh Bankar from Gondekhari was injured by the tiger.

After this incident, forest officials burst crackers to push the tiger towards the forest. The aerial distance between the two spots where the attacks took place is 6km.

According to Sawan Bahekar, president of Gondia’s NGO Sustaining Environment and Wildlife Assemblage (SEWA), the chased tiger is a young dispersing male from Khairlanji range in MP.

“The unfortunate incident is a fallout of lack of strong monitoring and coordination between Maharashtra and MP forest officials,” alleged Bahekar.

In a late night press release, Bhandara deputy conservator of forest (DyCF) Vivek Hoshing said efforts are on to capture the tiger. “For the past eight days, it is moving in cluster of forest and farms connecting Binaki, Sukli, Gondekhari, Sihora and Chulhad villages. The spot where it attacked a villager last Saturday is 5km from today’s incident,” he said.

After the tiger was sighted on Saturday noon, a crowd started gathering to scare it away. Though forest and police officials swung into action, they failed to control the mob which had a free run. “After allowing the situation to go out of hand, forest officials want to capture the innocent animal. This is unacceptable. There is no record of cattle or human kill against this tiger. The latest attacks were due to poor mob mentality,” added Bahekar.

SEWA volunteers are monitoring two tigers since January 7. These tigers are suspected to have entered Tumsar and Tiroda forest ranges from neighbouring MP. One tiger quietly moved towards Nagzira-Waraseoni after entering Tiroda and Gondia range. The one involved in the attack came into limelight on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Reaffirming a strategic partnership, India and Brazil on Saturday signed 15 agreements as Prime Minister Narendra Modi held talks with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro who will also be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade at Rajpath on Sunday.

India wants to open up its relations with Latin American countries , and Brazil could become New Delhi’s gateway to the continent.

The two sides signed a joint statement and an action plan to deepen cooperation in defence and security; trade and investment; agriculture and energy; civil aviation; energy; environment; and health and innovation. They promised to work together to conclude an agreement to deal with international terrorism. The major focus was on boosting bilateral trade and investment as both the large economies have been hit by economic slowdown.

The 15 agreements cover a wide range of areas including oil and gas, mineral resources, traditional medicine, animal husbandry, bio-energy and trade and investment.

India and Brazil drew up ambitious plan to boost their stuttering economies by expanding cooperation in oil, gas and minerals sectors, and set a target of USD 15 billion in bilateral trade by 2022. “Your visit to India has opened a new chapter in ties between India and Brazil,” Modi said. Tweeting later, Modi said, “Apart from bilateral cooperation, India and Brazil are working together at various multilateral forums. We see immense synergies on various issues including the need to uproot the menace of terrorism. India and Brazil will keep working together for a better planet.”

Devendra Fadnavis was delivers a talk on CAA

Nagpur: A group of 10 to 15 people, allegedly from city Youth Congress unit, on Saturday evening were stopped and evicted from the venue where leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis was delivering a talk on ‘Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA )’.

The talk organized under the Late Manoramabai Mundle Lecture Series by Dharampeth Education Society at Dharampeth Kanya School Ground on North Ambazari Road, witnessed attendance of mainly right-wing activists, citizens and RSS ideologue MG Vaidya.

The Youth Congress activists alleged that around 30 to 40 Bharatiya Janat Yuva Morcha (BJYM) activists didn’t allow them to enter the venue though they had only come to listen to the ex-CM.

BJYM activists, led by city president Shivani Dani, said they had no objection to anyone attending the event but suspected the Youth Congress activists from South-West constituency would disrupt Fadnavis’s lecture.

“They were about to raise slogans. We told them to do it outside,” Dani told TOI.

Around six youths were rounded up and taken to Bajaj Nagar police station where cops recorded their names and addresses before releasing them. They were detained after they accused the organizers and cops of not letting them listen to the talk and started raising ‘Youth Congress Zindabad’ slogans.

In the speech, which went for over an hour, the MLA from South-West Constituency accused the mainstream political parties of spreading canards and attempting to create anarchy in the country. “India is marching towards $5 trillion economy under Modiji but these parties want to stall the progress. This will only benefit the enemies of India,” said Fadnavis.

The former CM reiterated the Sangh Parivar’s rhetoric on CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Fadnavis said while the CAA was meant to give citizenship and not take it away from anyone, there was no plan to implement NRC across the country by the Modi government. “Some parties are instilling fears in the minds of minorities, especially Muslims, that they would be sent to Pakistan or thrown out of the country. False news and social media propaganda are running. Every day a new list of documents are circulated asking Muslims and others to search them. This is not true. Not every social media post is genuine,” he said, referring to the one where a purport ‘New Constitution Draft’ allegedly by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat went viral.

At the same time, Fadnavis said there are two sets of people who need to be differentiated while considering for citizenship. “One is those who came here after being persecuted while the other came in search of employment but indulged in unlawful activities. There is talk of giving citizenship to not just Hindus from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan but also the second lot which has been found indulging in terrorism actives,” he said.

KOCHI/ THIRUVANANTHAPURAM : The opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala on Saturday sought the assembly speaker’s permission to introduce a resolution urging the President to recall governor Arif Mohammed Khan.

Confirming this, Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala told reporters in Kochi that the demand for recall was necessitated because of the governor’s continued objection to the resolution passed by the assembly against the controversial citizenship act , which is tantamount to insulting the assembly and rejecting the sentiments of the people.

“The governor raising objections to the resolution passed by the assembly is a serious insult to the assembly… If the governor has any objection to the resolution, he should intimate the speaker in writing. His questioning the actions taken by the assembly and defying it is not acceptable,” he said.

Reacting to the development, governor Khan told reporters in Thiruvananthapuram that those seeking his removal should approach the President not the assembly speaker. “They have the right to seek my removal. But for that, they should approach the President who appointed me… It’s wrong to claim that the governor is in confrontation with the government. It’s not so. I’m only discharging my duties,” he said.

“I'm fully aware that I have to discharge my duties with the aid and advise of council of ministers. They are an elected body. I have full respect for them. But then the institution of governor is there to keep an eye on the government that they transact the business of the government in accordance with rule, law and constitution. I am the constitutional head of the government. We are not separate. This is my government. I can’t have a conflict with myself,” he said.

The governor also said that if “they (state government) hide something from me, as they did in the case of going to the Supreme Court against CAA, that is not lawful”.

It is the first time in the history of the Kerala assembly that a resolution demanding recall of the governor has been mooted.

“The ability to speak Assamese is not enough. If one does not know how to write in Assamese, one will not be able to apply for a state government job. We will bring a law in this regard within this year. The move is aimed at protecting the Assamese language ,” state finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said here on Saturday.

“An Assamese who does not know how to write in his language will not get (a government) job. My son studies outside the state and he can speak in Assamese but he can’t write in Assamese. This means, he will not be eligible to get a job here,” he added.

In next month’s assembly session, the state government will introduce two bills — one prohibiting the indigenous people from transferring their land rights to non-indigenous people, and the other making the teaching of Assamese compulsory in schools up to Class X.

NEW DELHI: There may be a significant addition of 10,000 new postgraduate medical seats from the new academic session this year that will help improve availability of specialists across the country as well as facilitate the district residency programme, which entails at least three months of rural posting .

The Board of Governors - vested with powers of the MCI - has approved the proposal to increase PG seats after states raised concerns about the residency programme, saying hospitals attached to medical colleges will suffer if these students are sent to district hospitals, a senior official said. The service at district hospitals is mandatory for every PG student.

The BoG, headed by Niti Aayog member VK Paul, has given the go-ahead to district residency programme, another senior official, who is member of BoG, told TOI . At present, there are over 23,000 PG and 68,500 undergraduate medical seats in both government and private colleges across the country.

The district residency programme has been in the works, but the BoG approval will facilitate the increase in seats in the 2020-21 session itself. As per health ministry data, India faces a shortfall of around 82% specialists.

MUMBAI: Two classmates, aged 11, from Mira Road staged their kidnapping and subsequent escape from their abductors on Wednesday, after being reprimanded by their teacher for not doing their homework.

The girls, students of class IV at an English medium school in Mira Road, travelled ticketless to Virar in their uniform.

Their 'abduction' came to light when one of the girls called her father on his mobile, using a juice vendor's phone in Virar. She told her father that she and her friend had been kidnapped by a 'burqa-clad woman in car' and taken to Virar at knife-point. She said that at a traffic signal, they managed to bite the woman's hand, get out of the car, and get lost in the crowd to hoodwink the abductors.

The girls' parents rushed to Virar, took custody of the girls, and filed a kidnapping case with the police. The case was then transferred to the Naya Nagar police station . Inspector Kailash Barve said that they examined CCTV footage in the locality of where the girls claimed the abduction took place. He said they found no evidence of the girls' story.

On further questioning, the girls admitted to being pulled up by their teacher. They said the teacher had asked them to bring their parents to school. Afraid of the scolding their parents would give them, they staged the kidnapping. The girls said they did it based on crime serials on TV.

Midnapore/Jhargram: Inspection of arms stocked in police station armouries has started across Jhargram and West Midnapore days after 18 single-barrel guns went missing from the Lalgarh PS armoury. The arms belonged to people with valid licences.

Two cops, including SI Tarapada Tudu, and two of their local accomplices were arrested after the matter came to light. Tudu, who was in charge of the Lalgarh PS armoury, had handed over responsibilities to Biswajit Panja on January 16. After Tudu took up his new posting at Jamboni PS, Panja reported to the Lalgarh IC that 18 guns were missing. Jhargram SP Amitkumar Bharat Rathod said these had not been recovered yet.

The inspections that followed are being led by inspectors or DSPs but are yet to uncover any more discrepancies. Inspectors-in-charge or officers-in-charge of police stations are keeping track of findings by these teams.

West Midnapore SP Dinesh Kumar said: “These inspections are conducted routinely to look for discrepancies in arms stored in police station armouries.”

Kolkata: Nine years after being awarded a Padma Shri in 2011, veteran vocalist Pt Ajoy Chakraborty has been conferred the Padma Bhushan.

A torchbearer of the Patiala gharana, 68-year-old Chakraborty told TOI he is “happy” with the news and wants to continue doing more work to propagate Indian classical music.

“I am happy and feel this is a result of the blessings of my guru, Pt Gnan Prakash Ghosh. I hope I can carry on with the work that I want to do,” he said.

Explaining this “work”, he referred to this passion of grooming youngsters. “Nowadays, my performances have become very secondary for me. I want to groom more students. My daughter, Kaushiki, has become famous all over the world. I would have been happier if she had more competition. I want 10 more Kaushikis to come up. I come across many with a lot of potential. If their parents are sorted, I think they have it in them to go far. It requires talent, fire in the belly and good support from the guardians for them to go far.”

Asked what needs to be done on behalf of the government to promote Indian classical music, he said: “There should be more people in positions of power who love Indian classical music. The media, too, has to do its bit.”

Pt Manilal Nag was conferred the Padma Shri. The 81-year-old sitarist said: “It is a milestone for the Bishnupur gharana. This award is a recognition of the 400-year-old classical and dhrupad tradition of Bengal that dominated the country’s music scenario in the first half of the last century. I have disciples all over the world. I love to share my joy with all of them while my family feels proud that a long-awaited reward is finally here.”

Sushovan Banerjee, known as ‘ek takar doctor’, also received the Padma Shri. The 81-year-old has been treating patients for a Re 1 fee since 1964 in his Bolpur clinic Nevedita Seva Sadan.

Banerjee, who graduated from RG Kar Medical College, completed a PG degree in pathology from Calcutta University with a gold medal before heading to London for a diploma in haematology.

“I had been working as a senior register in a London for four years before I decided to come back to my country to serve the poor. I got a call from the home ministry on Friday night that I had been chosen for Padma Shri. I am absolutely elated at my work being recognised,” he told TOI.

Banerjee has refused lucrative offers from many organisations, choosing instead to stay in his native Bolpur to tend to the poor and tribals.

KOLKATA: Funds-starved Calcutta Telephones is set to lease out parts of Telephone Bhavan , its Dalhousie Square headquarters that happens to be one of the city’s most easily recognised addresses.The Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd ( BSNL ) subsidiary is also looking to rent out telephone exchanges and even sell some of its prime properties across the city, besides leasing out parts of its nine-storey headquarters, as part of a drive to monetise its assets to keep itself afloat.CalTel chief general manager Biswajit Paul said he had already received the nec-essary clearances from the centre to sell a few prime properties located at posh addresses and lease or rent out the rest to garner revenue.For Telephone Bhavan, which overlooks Lal Dighi and Writers’ Buildings in Dalhousie Square, the city’s most precious heritage district, CalTel has fixed a rent of Rs 284 per square foot. The ground-plus-eight-storey Art Deco building, with built-up space of 1.5 lakh square feet, was constructed in 1954.“We propose to rent out around 45,000 square feet or virtually the entire ground floor of Telephone Bhavan, retaining only a sales counter. We also plan to rent out 8,000 square feet in the 30,000-square-foot annexe building,” Paul said.If CalTel finds takers at the price it has quoted, it will make a neat Rs 1.5 crore in monthly rental from the two properties in Dalhousie Square. That, along with whatever else it is able to cobble together in rental income from sprawling telephone exchanges in various neighbourhoods, will come in handy in meeting its fin-ancial commitments like paying salaries.The second highest rental — of Rs 96 per square feet — has been fixed for the Salt Lake exchange located next to the Central Government Office Complex.Other high-value properties are located in Chowringhee, Alipore, Ballygunge, Kalighat and on Sarat Bose Road. “Initially, the rental period will be three years, following which terms of the contract will be reviewed for extension,” Paul said.Properties that will go under the hammer for outright sale are situated in Madhyamgram and Maniktala. The Bhubaneswar circle of BSNL has already leased out a number of properties in the Odisha capital to banks.The public sector unit, facing an acute funds crunch, has already asked 1,700 employees to opt for VRS; the staff strength now is 2,500. The VRS scheme has also helped unlock big chunks of office space. A process is underway to relocate the remaining staff so that the vacant spaces can be aggregated for renting out. “The offices are being redesigned for optimal use of work space,” the CGM said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73631062,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-102271,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/caltel-set-to-lease-part-of-landmark-hq-to-stay-afloat/articleshow/73622337.cms

File image used for representational purpose

KOLKATA: National Investigation Agency has claimed that an Assam module of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, in operation till July 2019, had been trained at Burdwan’s Simulia madrassa , which became synonymous with the October 2014 Khagragarh blast .

Citing the high seizure of arms, NIA has also claimed the terror group — banned in Bangladesh and India — was eyeing attacks across eastern India, including Bengal. The revelations were made in a charge sheet filed in a Guwahati special court on Friday against five JMB members, who were charged under Section 25(1B) of the Arms Act and Sections 18 & 38 of UAPA.

NIA investigations revealed that all five were recruited to JMB by Barpeta resident Sahanur Alom, arrested in 2014 for involvement in the blast that killed two persons. He is serving an 8-year sentence for “conspiracy to commit terrorist acts in India and recruiting and training other members of JMB”.

“Accused persons have undergone training as JMB cadres in Barpeta at the house of Sahanur Al-om. Some accused were also trained at Simulia madrassa,” said NIA.

The charge sheet will be a precursor to one expected soon against Jahirul Sk (29), one of the 37 named by NIA as having spearheaded JMB training at Simulia. He was arrested last August from Madhya Pradesh. Sources said Jahirul, from Karimpur in Nadia, was a resident of the madrassa. He was initially a JMB driver and placed in charge of the Nano used to ferry JMB recruits.

Over time, besides arranging logistics, he became an able organizer who issued sermons and indoctrinated recruits.

“Given that more than two dozen of his cadres have been arrested in four years and that the original JMB no longer exists, Jahirul’s movements between Bengal, Assam and Madhya Pradesh are under investigation. The charge sheet is expected on similar lines,” said a source.

The fake call centre had made Rs 70-75 lakh in about three months

Gurgaon: One of the kingpins of the fake call centre that cheated Amazon customers in the US and Mexico was arrested from Delhi on Saturday. Umesh Sharma (33) ran the call centre along with Munish and Vishal from an office in Udyog Vihar.

Sharma is originally a resident of Paschim Vihar in Delhi and had graduated in commerce. “We have been able to nab one of the kingpins behind the scam. We are currently questioning him to get more details about his two partners,” said Karan Goel, ACP, DLF.

He added that the police had retrieved some data from computers in the call centre, which has been sent to Madhuban labs near Karnal for examining. Two teams have been formed to trace the other two accused and they have been raiding locations which they suspect could be their hideouts.

The police have also questioned employees of the sham call centre to know more about how they cheated their targets. Around 30 of them had been detained on Friday, but were released after questioning. Most of the employees have claimed they were unaware of the scam and were under the impression that they were working for Amazon itself.

According to police, the fake call centre in Udyog Vihar had been operating since November last year and had made Rs 70-75 lakh during this period. The call centre, which did not have any licence or permission to operate, would send messages to targets saying their Amazon accounts had witnessed some “unusual activity” and would be blocked soon. The caller urged the gullible targets to dial a toll free number and pay $100-150 through gift cards in exchange for the solution offered. The money would be routed to India through bank accounts in Europe and China, the police said.

Of the 30 youths who were detained on Friday, 25 are boys and the remaining girls. Most of them had joined the call centre after finishing Class 12 and were paid around Rs 15,000 to Rs 2000 a month. Police said 10 of them are from the Northeast, while the remaining are from UP, Delhi and Punjab.

The script they would read out to their targets in the US and Mexico and other voice samples were sent to them by the three alleged masterminds. When the targets would dial the toll free number — 1-855-918-0438 — from any country, the call would land in the Gurgaon office and the employees would read from the script in a heavily accented voice.

File image used for representation.

KOLHAPUR: A 30-year-old businessman from Maharashtra’s Satara district allegedly murdered his close friend and tried to pass off that body as his own to claim Rs 1.5 crore in life insurance , police said. The suspect, Sumit More, was arrested by Satara police from Jejuri in Pune district late on Friday night.

Police said More suffered huge financial losses in his business at Navi Mumbai and meticulously planned the murder to pay off the debts by claiming his life insurance.

Deputy superintendent of police (Satara) Suhas Garud said More has confessed to the murder and narrated the chronology of events. More killed his friend, Tanaji Baba Aawale, a tailor, because Aawale’s body structure was very like his, Garud said. On January 21, More requested the victim to accompany him to Mahimaangad, his native place. An unsuspecting Tanaji went with him

During interrogation, More admitted to hitting Tanaji on the head with a stump and later setting the car (MH 01 DB7105) alight. More waited till the car was completely burned and left the place, Garud said.

“Koregaon police found a charred body in a gutted car on January 22 on the Bodhewadi-Diska road. The car was registered in the name of Sumit More and it was easy to trace his residence,” the officer said.

“Police handed over the body, which was charred beyond recognition, to More’s family, assuming it was his because the car was registered in his name,” Garud said.

However, police kept a close watch on them and got suspicious as nobody seemed to be mourning the death while preparing for the last rites. Then More’s elder brother was questioned. Initially, he gave inconsistent information to police, but after sustained interrogation, he told them that his younger brother was hiding in Jejuri, Garud said.

A Satara court on Saturday remanded More in four-day police custody. Police said the family of the victim, Tanaj, were not aware about his death until police informed them about the same.

“More arrests are likely in the case during investigation as some of the relatives of More may be in the know about the murder plot,” police said.

GURUGRAM: At about 6°C, it is a chilly morning and a particularly windy one. Exactly at 8am, a bell goes off and the din slowly dies down as children settle down, jostling for the few sunny spots in the courtyard. School is in session. This has been the routine for the past 10 days — because the classes are now stopgap warehouses.The government school at Shivaji Nagar in Sector 11 has 350 students. The 13 classrooms it had were not quite enough. Sometime around July last year, it got 150 more. The school at Om Nagar was under construction and its students were moved here. Pressed for space with 500 students, the school started conducting classes in double shifts. Ten days ago, some of these few classrooms went out of bounds.The education department stocked them with books. “Textbooks which will be distributed across various districts have been stocked in three classrooms,” said principal of the school, Madhubala. The books are meant for the next academic session, which will begin in April.So the students of classes II, IV and V have been moved to the corridors and out into the open for their classes. “It gets really cold and class starts early. We wear our sweaters and jackets but it is very windy sometimes,” said a class V student. Classes continue till 12.30pm.Parents are worried. “It is disturbing that children are forced to sit outside. The education department could have stored the books at a godown instead of compromising on the health and education of children,” said Munish Kumar, a parent. “Children get sick more easily and they are the ones forced to endure this. It is heartbreaking,” said Ranjit Chaudhry, another parent.The school may have more to fix. With no cleaning staff, teachers clean the toilets. “The situation is pathetic. I clean the toilet of the primary wing because the school does not have any staff to do it. Most government schools in the district don’t,” said Om Prakash, head of the primary wing.Principal Madhubala said the children’s health is a priority for the administration. “We are taking care of the children. They are clad in winterwear,” she said, adding that the education department will “take action soon”.",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73627053,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-665540,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/classrooms-used-to-store-books-students-made-to-sit-out-in-cold/articleshow/73620815.cms

426,['26/01/2020'],ICICI Bank posts highest ever quarterly profit,"This story is from January 26, 2020

MUMBAI: ICICI Bank has reported its highest ever quarterly net profit of Rs 4,146 crore for the quarter ended December 2013, which was two-and-a-half times higher (158%) than the Rs 1,604 crore reported in the corresponding quarter last year.

The year-on-year growth in domestic advances was 16% on December 31, 2019. Advances growth was a 19% year-on-year growth in its retail loan portfolio on December 31, 2019. Total deposits increased by 18% year-on-year to Rs 7.2 lakh crore. Sandeep Batra, president, said the earnings were driven by an improvement in operating profit while the bottom-line got an additional boost through a reduction in corporate tax rate .

The bank's core operating profit (profit before provisions and tax, excluding treasury income) increased by 24% year-on-year to Rs 7,017 crore in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 (Q3-2020) from Rs 5,667 crore in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 (Q3-2019).

Although the bank managed recovery from the insolvency proceedings of Essar Steel , these were partially offset by having to provide for losses due to a default by Karvy. Another large loan, which was provided in the form of refinancing, to a south-based group, required provisioning as the refinance was classified as loan restructuring.

File image used for representation.

NEW DELHI: A man who had his wife murdered two days after taking a life insurance policy in her name almost 18 years ago has been awarded life imprisonment by the Supreme Court .

The man, a resident of Uttarakhand , had alleged that five men had entered his house in the intervening night of March 24 and 25, 2002 to abduct him and his wife was shot dead by them when she resisted. But he failed to mention any reason for his “attempted abduction” or name any person who tried to abduct him. He also could not provide any description of physical features of the intruders.

Holding that there was inconsistency in statements made by the accused before police and the trial court, a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and Navin Sinha said he failed to furnish any plausible defence and convicted him in the murder case and awarded life sentence. The court noted that the accused tried to give false evidence by first raising alleged “extramarital affairs” of his wife and later stating that five intruders had broken into his house to abduct him. The court said there was no evidence to prove that people had barged into his house as there were no footprints in the muddy courtyard.

“The appellant initially stated in the FIR that three persons entered his house at midnight to abduct him. In his evidence as defence witness, he stated that there were five persons. If the intruders had come to abduct him and his wife had been shot dead after she tried to prevent his abduction, it would have been all the more convenient for the intruders to take him away with them. No explanation has been furnished by him in this regard,” the bench said.

The bench said it was very difficult to accept his explanation that despite the presence of five people, one of whom could have easily overpowered the woman, she was shot dead.

“He has not mentioned any reason or named any on suspicion of enmity or otherwise... No details of the physical features and approximate age, height, built of the intruders have been mentioned, even if they had their faces covered, despite the fact that the spot map establishes the light of an electric bulb. The appellant initially took the defence that he suspected his wife of having an illicit relationship... intruders having entered by scaling the northern side wall built of mud and cement is belied by the spot map and evidence that no damage or marks were found on the wall,” the court said.

While upholding the trial court and HC verdicts on his conviction and life imprisonment, the apex court also took into consideration statements of his in-laws who said the accused was very greedy and had demanded money from them and had also taken an LIC policy in the name of his wife just days before the incident.

KOLKATA: Barcelona with a population of 1.6 million, which is just about one fourth of Kolkata’s 4.6 million, recorded 65 deceased organ donations in 2019. Kolkata clocked only 11 donations in the same year, just about one sixth of the figure of Barcelona. This year, organ donation in Kolkata has started on a great note with three donations in January. But there is a need for more focussed action to keep up the momentum, feel experts.“One of the most important things is to train ICU doctors who can identify the brain deaths. Keeping these intensivists at the forefront will make a lot of difference,” said Matri Manyalich of Barcelona University Hospital.Manyalich was in Kolkata as an internal expert at the recently held Kolkata Transplant Colloquium (KTC) and gave tips to doctors in the city.Kolkata in 2018 had registered 15 organ donations. But the figure came down to 11 in 2019, including two from the neighbouring districts.“In our hospital, we have a transplant procurement management team (TPM) with 10 intensivists complemented by an equal number of trained nurses. This team works works 24x7 dedicatedly on deceased organ donation and procurement. All hospitals in Spain has to have a TPM unit,” Manyalich said.A leading country when it comes to deceased organ donation, Spain recorded 2,300 donations in 2019, against 2243 in 2018. In addition to highly organised process of deceased donation, Spain has a ‘opt-out’ system in which all citizens become organ donors automatically unless they choose to opt out.“In Spain, the deceased organ donation rate is 49 per million populations. Though citizens can opt out, the refusal rate today is just about 14%. Media also played a very supportive role,” he said.The total organ donation figure for India in 2019 was only 890. Maharashtra and Tamil were Nadu major contributors.Manylaich, who is also the president of Donation & Transplantation Institute (DTI), an institute that has been training healthcare professionals worldwide including China, Croatia, Germany and UAE on organ donation, explained how such training could push organ donation in these countries. He is hopeful that his team would be working in India in the near future.“We need more deceased donations for transplant surgeries. Now that Kolkata has started witnessing such donations, we have roped in professor Matri Manyalich to get valuable inputs from him,” said Deepak Shankar Ray, chairman, organising committee of KTC.

More than 4 tmcft of water is now getting wasted into sea at Marakkanam.

We support when it serves the interest of the people. Unlike you (Stalin), we don't blindly support,"" he said, accusing the DMK of being in power at the Centre for 13 years without bringing any schemes to the state.

KOLKATA: Some new entrants to the mounted police stable, who were earlier race horses, and their riders have undergone rigorous training and the others “retraining” to ensure impeccable performance at the Republic Day parade .When the 20 single-coat horses bring out the best of the Kolkata mounted police on Red Road on Sunday, all eyes will be on Chandragupta , Bindusara and Ashoka, the youngest of the 11 studs that have joined the “veterans” in the force. These three, who have been chosen for the R-Day parade for the first time, joined 1.5 years ago and have trained for barely a year. While the three are six years old, some of the older horses are 17 years old and have decade-long experience. The young horses are initially being kept at the Alipore Bodyguard Lines, where they are receiving training for the next year before being relocated to the unit’s stables at the S N Banerjee Road address.“Three horses, who were veterans in the parades, had retired and we were looking for replacements. We chose the young ones, who matched the skills of the trained horses and can follow instructions,” said a senior officer with the mounted police. The training imparted by an international expert from Singapore was a four-day affair, where riders from the Mumbai Police, which are reintroducing mounted police, joined them with other riders from Bengal Police . “But it won’t be easy to spot them in the group. They are placed at different points on the foursquare set. One is on the second line, another on the third,” said the officer.The Mounted Police unit that patrols the 1,000-acre Maidan had last inducted a horse over a decade ago. The count had since dwindled from the sanctioned number of 98 to 67. The fresh inductions have bolstered the strength to 78.Several of the new horses are of Kathiawadi breed, named after Kathiawad in Gujarat. These sturdy horses have a track record of bravery and loyalty in battle and are known for alertness. “Features of Kathiawadi breed are similar to that of Arabian horses. They (Kathiawadi breed) have evolved by breeding indigenous stock with the Arab stallions,” said a horse breed expert. Earlier, most horses used to be bought from England or Australia. But that proved to be too expensive. To be cost effective, the force began sourcing horses from farms in Delhi, Pune, Mumbai, Haryana and Punjab.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73624811,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-261221,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chandragupta-bindusara-ashoka-the-3-young-studs-wholl-debut-at-republic-day-parade/articleshow/73624832.cms

GUWAHATI: The Centre is all set to sign a comprehensive peace deal with the four factions of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) and the All Bodo Students Union on Monday.

The deal is likely to be signed in the presence Union home minister Amit Shah and Assam CM Sarbananda Sonowal , who will leave for the national capital on Sunday evening. State government sources, however, said there was no confirmation on the date so far.

Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the new peace accord would not upgrade the existing Bodoland Territorial Autonomous Council set up under the 6th Schedule of the Constitution to a separate state or Union Territory. ""Neither a Union Territory will be created, nor new areas will be added to the BTAD. Assam's territorial integrity will be kept intact if a fresh accord is signed in the near future,"" he added.

Speculation is rife that the new accord would include new areas of the state under the Bodo council. The present Bodoland Territorial Council area comprises four districts - Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baska and Udalguri. They were created under the 2003 accord signed between the Centre, the state and the now disbanded Bodo Liberation Tigers .

""The framework of the accord is being prepared by the Centre and will bring permanent peace in Bodoland. The Centre has informed the state government that the new agreement which will not divide Assam further,"" Sarma said.

Celebrations at Tiretta Bazaar

KOLKATA: The Chinese in Tangra and Tiretta Bazaar ushered in the New Year with music, dance and merriment late on Friday night with the celebrations that carried on into the wee hours of Saturday. This is the Year of the Rat.

Preparations for the New Year had began days earlier with 10 groups practising lion dance. On Friday night - the New Year's eve - the groups started from different parts of Tangra, including the Pei Mei School, dancing to the beat of drums and cymbals as they progressed through the lanes and bylanes of the Chinatown to finally converge at the marketplace. There they went around in a procession.

After the show concluded around 1pm, the groups dispersed and visited Chinese homes, burst crackers, performed the lion dance and handed out good luck red envelopes. This carried on till dawn on Saturday when the New Year's eve festivity finally drew to an end.

On Saturday, many homes had vegetarian meals. Some kept their establishments shut. The restaurants that were open shut shop early on Saturday, the New Year's day. On Sunday, the lion dance groups plan to visit Chinese families living away from the twin hubs in Tangra and Tiretta Bazaar in vans. ""On Janaury 27 and 28, a carnival will be held at Pei Mei School grounds with games, lottery and food. It is popular not just among the Chinese but the non-Chinese population in Tangra as well,"" said Chinese Indian Association president Bean Ching Law.

What makes the celebration special each year is the arrival of Chinese Indians who have migrated to distant lands but return to the roots to spend the New Year with family. This year, too, Tangra's population has swelled to 3,000 from the usual 2,000 with many flying down from Canada, Hong Kong and Australia. Among them is a 56-year-old who was a child when he migrated to New York with his parents 37 years ago and has returned to Kolkata for the first time since.

At first glance, nothing seems out of place in the air-conditioned, state-of-the-art gym in Mumbai’s Jogeshwari (West). But a closer look reveals that among the fitness freaks sweating it out on treadmills or pumping iron is a girl in black hijab and loose tracksuits. Standing on a leg, her other leg stretched out ramrod-like, she balances her body for a few minutes. In fitness parlance, this is called pistol squat — one of the several breathtaking bone-straightening exercises she practises regularly.

Meet Momin Haleema Sadiya , 19, a middle-class Muslim collegian who defies the image of woman in hijab.

With a gold medal in martial arts and silver in powerlifting state-level competitions under her belt, this “power-packed” calisthenics ( bodyweight exercises ) performer, fitness trainer and martial arts athlete has over 3,500 followers on Instagram. She says it only “explains my instinct to remain fit and denotes my mental strength”. She will be one of the performers at the World Hijab Day event on February 1 in Mumbai.

Sadiya, who will let her limbs speak through her performance at the event that is being held by city-based NGO Al Hadi Organisation, will demonstrate that “hijab empowers and not subjugates women”.

Fighting entrenched societal prejudices is second nature to Sadiya. Not long ago, when a maulvi disapproved of her devotion to fitness and tried to discourage her, saying “girls should be docile and nazuk (delicate)”, she told him she was only into physical exercise and not showing off her physique. “I am not into body-building shows where you have to be in bikini and flaunt toned biceps and abs (abdominal muscles). I am into exercises which strengthen body, improves immunity and concentration,” she explains.

She grew up watching elder sister Saima doing martial arts. “She couldn’t continue as my parents didn’t encourage her. She quit and she got married. But I got hooked to it and pestered my parents to let me follow my passion,” says Sadiya.

Sadiya credits martial arts trainer Mohammed Sardar “for whatever I am today”. “He really encouraged me a lot and showed that I only had to shed my inhibitions,” she adds.

Besides Sadiya, calligraphy artist Salva Rasool, karate referee Shaheen Akhtar, educationist Asma Zaidi and politician Fatima Muzaffar, dancer-turned-blogger Halima Shaikh, all in hijab, will be part of a panel to share their success stories despite wearing hijab on February 1. “Our purpose is to tell the world that hijab is not a hindrance to career path. Many female talents get wasted as they wear hijab and are hesitant to take initiatives as they think perhaps their progress will be blocked because of how they dress. We want to break that notion,” said Shabana Sadik Hussein Pattawala of Al-Hadi Organisation.

Sadiya’s parents — father is in real estate business while mother is a retired school teacher — are now convinced and are backing her to the hilt. A certificate course in calisthenics from Australia is in the pipeline for this hijabi, who moves with her head held high.

The fire department rescued others in a four-hour operation. A female teacher and some of the injured children are being treated at the GTB and Panchsheel hospital.Locals say the house belonged to Umesh's father.

After this, a committee was formed, which was headed by Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar to draft the constitution.

No senior Omaxe officials turned up at the Friday meeting

NOIDA: Officials of the Noida Authority held a mediation meeting with builders’ representatives and members of apartment owners’ association (AOA) of Grand Omaxe society in Sector 93 B on Friday. Residents have been complaining that the builder has been reluctant in handing over the ownership and has also not returned the maintenance security amount to the AOA.

As per residents, a total of Rs 12 crore for Interest Free Maintenance Security (IFMS), collected by the builder, has not been transferred to the AOA though representatives of the builders had contested the claim. Other issues included not transferring the documentation such as power and water bills, layout maps for the society, fire NOC, environment clearances and compliance certificates in the name of the AOA.

“The builder has been trying not to hand over the documents so that we are not able to claim full ownership of our property and its services,” said PVS Prakash, AOA president. Residents said several infrastructure work was also left incomplete.

The Authority officials said, a mediation meeting was called last year as well when the builder’s representatives had not turned up. Even for the Friday meeting, Omaxe had sent its junior officials. The builder could not be contacted for a comment.

Additional CEO of the Authority Shruti said, “We’ve instructed the builder to send some senior officials with decision making power for the next meeting scheduled in February. We have also asked them to pay Rs 1 crore for IFMS by next month.”

The flyover will connect sectors 121 and 123

NOIDA: The Noida Authority has finally selected a consultant to prepare the design and details of a flyover at Parthala Chowk . The flyover will connect sectors 121 and 123 and will be built along Vikas Marg.

Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System ( DIMTS ) Limited has been selected as the consultant to prepare the decongestion plan for Parthala Chowk, one of the busiest intersections in the city. According to an initial survey by the Authority, Parthala Chowk sees more than 28,000 vehicles during peak hours. Over next few years, the traffic police says it expects the volume of traffic at this intersection to increase by 60-70%.

Details of the proposed design of the flyover are being worked upon by DIMTS, which will clarify all specifications related of orientation, alignment and distance from the upcoming metro line.

“DIMTS will submit a plan at the earliest. It’s likely to be approved during the Authority’s board meeting on January 31. The cost estimates would be submitted too. Proposal is nearly ready and is being reviewed by the CEO,” said an official from the Noida Authority.

According to the proposal, the flyover will be about 780 metres long and have eight lanes. A foot overbridge is also being made in the vicinity that will connect with the upcoming metro station near Sector 122. The alignment of the metro line and the flyover, that’ll be parallel to each other, were also discussed before finalising the proposal.

The Authority had earlier set aside Rs 90 crore for developing a flyover skirting Parthala Chowk near Sector 121. After conducting a survey, officials had made a presentation before the Authority CEO about six months ago. They had finalised a flyover that would have connected Gaur Chowk in Noida Extension to Balaknath crossing near Sector 71. But, the project was put on hold after the Authority sought more clarity on the design and budget requirements.

BENGALURU: The Karnataka government will soon simplify and expedite the procedure for industries to purchase agricultural land to attract more investors. Potential investors told chief minister BS Yediyurappa during the World Economic Forum at Davos about hurdles in land acquisition. “Their complaint seemed to be genuine,’’ he said here on Saturday while sharing details of meetings with global industry players.The CM said the government will introduce amendments to Section 109 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961 to facilitate industries purchase land within 30 days as opposed to 60 days now. This will apply for both acquisition and conversion. “If the authorities don’t give permission within 30 days, it will be deemed to have been approved in both cases,’’ he added.Yediyurappa clarified that the amendment will be applicable to only those projects cleared by the State High Level Clearance Committee or single window agency. The amendment bill will be placed before the legislature in the session starting on February 17.The government has also decided to introduce a 30-day time frame for land use change (for non-agriculture purpose).However, industry sources said the amendments have been proposed not just because of complaints from investors but also due to the large number of pending projects. Of 142 proposals worth Rs 40,000 crore approved between 2013 and 2019 under Section 109, nearly 100 are non-starters or have been shelved. The state is struggling to find enough resources for development in the budget to be presented on March 5.Yediyurappa said the government is mulling over a comprehensive industrial policy in the budget session. “It’s difficult to quantify investments that will flow to Karnataka.

GHAZIABAD: A woman’s important work e-mails started disappearing on a regular basis and one day, she got a termination letter from her office in Ghaziabad for ignoring them.

Unable to figure out the reason, she wanted to start afresh and opened an account in job portals. But, she alleged, her mails regarding job offers and interviews started disappearing as well. “The woman then suspected her husband and confronted him. She then went to her in-laws to report the matter, after which they beat her up,” police said on Saturday, adding that the man and his parents were booked on Friday.

The woman, who now works with an MNC in Delhi, is from Kavi Nagar. She told police her husband had mental health issues and was of a suspicious nature. The 32-year-old woman said, “When I was working with a company in Noida, my husband hacked into my Gmail and Hotmail accounts and deleted emails.” She said when she filed for a divorce in 2019, her husband created a fake WhatsApp account on her name and sent lewd messages to her acquaintances.

An FIR has been lodged against the three under IPC sections and also under IT Act.

NOIDA: The Noida Authority has finalised a consultant for designing the city’s second golf course in Sector 151A. The agency will submit its report next week so that the estimate and other details can be approved in the authority’s board meeting on January 31. After the 18-hole golf course in Sector 38, this will be the city’s second, for which RTN Associates has been selected as the consultant.

Over the next few days, the group will prepare drawings, designs and estimates for the new 18-hole golf course. The Noida Authority plans to have a club, restaurant, gym as well as guest rooms on the premises of the new golf course. A 90-acre area has been set aside for the golf course.

“The required surveys have been done and soil testing is also complete. The consultant is preparing its final report and estimates now. We plan to make a complete facility with several new features,” said S P Singh, senior manager at the Noida Authority.

Once the design and estimates are ready, the report will be presented at the board meeting for approval. But before that, the report would be reviewed by the CEO.

According to officials, more than 1,500 applications for membership of the golf course are pending with the Authority as the existing one in Sector 38 has reached its full capacity and more members cannot be enrolled there.

The golf course in Sector 38 is about 30 years old. In its board meeting in September, the Noida Authority had approved the new golf course in Sector 151A.

NEW DELHI: India’s third-highest gallantry medal in peacetime, Shaurya Chakra , has been awarded to six Army and three police personnel for conspicuous bravery in counterterror operations , while the two pilots of the Mi-17 V5 helicopter shot down by “friendly fire” after the Balakot air strikes have been given the Vayu Sena Medal for gallantry.

In this year’s Republic Day list of 409 gallantry and other decorations, four Shaurya Chakras have been awarded posthumously to Naib Subedar Sombir Singh from the Army and Challapilla Narasimha Rao, Kamal Kishore and Aman Kumar under the ministry of home affairs.

Squadron Leaders Ninad Anil Mandavgane and Siddharth Vashisht, who were awarded the Vayu Sena Medal posthumously, were flying the ill-fated Mi-17 helicopter for an operational task when it was shot down at Budgam by a SpyDer quick-reaction antiaircraft missile fired by the air defence unit of the Srinagar airbase on February 27.

The four other IAF personnel killed in the accidental “blue on blue” incident, which took place during the time when Indian and Pakistani fighter jets were engaged in the aerial skirmish in the Nowshera sector along the Line of Control, have been awarded “mention-in-despatches”.

Victim Pari Kumari

DHARAMSHALA: An uncovered septic tank of a government health center has claimed the life of a two-and-a-half-year-old girl in Gagret area of Una district in Himachal Pradesh . The victim, Pari Kumari , had come with her parents Bhupinder Kumar and Kamlesh, as they wanted to meet some relative getting treatment at the centre. While no action has been taken against any government officials, police have named a private plumber, hired for minor repairs at the centre, in the FIR.

Incident had taken place on Friday. The family from a little village in Gagret area had come to the health center. The child went missing in the early afternoon. After after hours of physical search revealed no signs of her, CCTV footage led the family to her body in the uncovered septic tank of the building.

On Saturday, local residents expressed surprise at the fact that police had book plumber Shadi Lal instead of the administrators of the centre for leaving the septic tank uncovered, which led to the tragedy.

Lal told TOI, “I work privately, they (officials of the health center) had just contacted me to clean a few blocked lines in the building. I am not even a contractor. In routine, if they call me for repair work and I go there. It not my duty to purchase the tank covers and nor can I do that on my own.” He, however, did not say he could have devised a makeshift cover to prevent this kind of incident.

When contacted, Una superintendent of police Diwakar Sharma said police would question all the persons involved be they contractors or hospital administration. “Nothing can be ruled out till the final report of investigation comes. We are trying to find out whose negligence resulted into the death of child,” he added.

Health minister Vipin Parmar, told TOI over phone, no one had been suspended in this case but a departmental inquiry would be ordered to fix the responsibility.

Amritpreet Singh of Patiala and Lakshmi of Doraha in custody

LUDHIANA: The Special Task Force (STF) arrested live-in partners with 560g heroin that had been hidden in a specially-made cavity in the seat covers of their car. The heroin is worth Rs 2.5 crore in the international market.

The accused — Amritpreet Singh , 31, of Patiala and Lakshmi, 37, of NRI Colony of Doraha — stayed in a rented accommodation in Doraha, police said.

Inspector Harbans Singh, in-charge, STF Ludhiana, said the accused were arrested from near the canal bridge in Sahnewal following a tip-off. They were crossing the area, when STF personnel stopped them for checking at a checkpost.

Besides the contraband, police seized an electronic weighing machine and 60 empty packets from the car. The couple confessed that they had procured the heroin from a Nigerian national based in New Delhi, besides two other smugglers from Jammu and Tarn Taran.

Police said Amritpreet, who was earlier into farmer, and his live-in partner had been addicted to drugs for the past several years. Both got into drug peddling to buy drugs for themselves. Earlier, the woman was arrested by STF on December 24, 2018 with 200g heroin. However, she again started peddling drugs after she came out on bail.

Amritpreet is also facing trial in a NDPS case in Patiala. The accused have their clients in Ludhiana and its nearby villages.

464,['26/01/2020'],Power theft: Border areas take big bite out of PSPCL’s revenue pie,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Representative image

PATIALA: Despite efforts to cut down transmission losses, the cash-strapped Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is still losing Rs 1,200 crore every year to power theft in the state’s politically sensitive border zone.

Of all four zones into which Punjab has been divided for administrative purposes by PSPCL, transmission line losses are more than 30% in at least seven divisions, against the state’s average losses of 14.7%. Of these divisions, five fall in circles under the border zone.

Maximum losses have been reported from 12 divisions in Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Sangrur, where figures exceed 25%. In Tarn Taran circle, which falls in the border zone, Bhikhiwind and Patti divisions have losses of 47.14% and 40.28%, respectively. Amritsar cricle’s three divisions — West, Ajnala, and Sub-urban — have losses of 33.18%, 31.62% and 31.21%, respectively.

In the west zone, Malout division of Muktsar circle has losses of 33.28%. In the south zone, Patran division of Sangrur circle has losses of 30.24%. Divisions where losses are between 25 % and 30% are City Tarn Taran, Lehragaga, Bhagta Bhai Ka, Zira and Baghapurana divisions.

A source in PSPCL said the main reason for losses in these areas is political interference in efforts by the corporation to check power theft. The source said political patronage was provided irrespective of which party ruled the state.

Border and west zones have been notoriou for power theft, which costs PSPCL Rs 1,200 crore annually. These politicians call it a “facility” to their area consumers like “free power to agriculture”. “Politicians fear they might lose elections if power theft ‘facility’ is withdrawn from their ‘affectionate consumers’,” said an officer.

Contractual staff for meter readings is another big hole in the revenue of PSPCL. They incite and help consumers to slow down metering equipment or fill fake readings, putting PSPCL to a big loss, the officer added.

In Punjab, the deficit between actual cost of supply and actual revenue recovered is 48 paise per unit, which is highest amongst the 10 states where losses are less than 18%. Himachal Pradesh has the least gap of 3 paise per unit, while Gujarat and Goa have a gap of 6 paise per unit. The highest gap of Rs. 2.13 is in Arunachal Pradesh , followed by J&K with a gap of Rs. 1.85 per unit.

With the PSPCL moving the PSERC seeking another 14% hike in the cost of power for the next fiscal, bringing down losses can go a long way in keeping the rising power cost in check.

465,['26/01/2020'],Hotelier’s murder: Police to quiz aides to track down gangster,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Ludhiana: Hoping to track down notorious criminal Sukhwinder Singh Moni, who is the prime accused in the murder of hotelier Harjinder Singh Jindi at Jawahar Nagar, the police on Saturday brought three members of Moni’s gang on a production warrant from Ludhiana central jail.

The police had arrested the trio — Deepak Billa, Deepak Deepu of Shimlapuri and Ajay Kumar of Ferozepur — on November 13, 2019, for SBI ATM robbery in Sudhar area.

The police are now trying to find out Moni’s possible hideouts.

In their investigation, cops have also discovered that Jindi had talked to Moni after he had come out on bail in PNB robbery case in October 2019. Jindi had tried to convince Moni that he had passed on the information about him to police.

The police have prepared a sketch of Moni’s accomplice, who was there was with him at the time of firing.

Police commissioner Rakesh Agarwal said the police are scanning CCTV cameras installed in nearby localities to check where the car, used by the accused, headed after the crime. Now, the police will interrogate Billa, Deepu and Ajay to know whether Moni is hiding in the state or not.

Agarwal said, “The investigations so far have suggested rivalry between Moni and Jindi since 2016, when Moni’s gang had executed the PNB robbery in Kochar Market. When Moni was arrested in the case, he believed that Jindi had given information about the former to cops.”

“Thereafter, Moni came out on bail in early 2019 and then executed Rs 25-lakh robbery from a cash van in Roorkee in April 2019. The Roorkee police arrested him but he came out on bail in October 2019. Following that, Jindi and Moni had talked to each other to resolve their differences,” Agarwal said.

“The family has claimed that Jindi had a heated argument with someone over the phone a few days ago and that person might be Moni,” he added.

On November 2, 2019, the Moni’s gang had uprooted an ATM, containing Rs 23 lakh from Sudhar area. Following the incident, the police was after Moni and his accomplices. In the meanwhile, Moni allegedly shot at a man in Ambala on December 6. He was hired as a contract killer.

Fake number plate

Police commissioner Rakesh Agarwal said the accused had used a mobile application to get a Delhi registration number for his car. Even if the police had managed to track down the details of car used in the crime, the investigation will roam around the person who actually owned the number, he added.

467,['26/01/2020'],"After 12 years, panel formed on Buddha Nullah bridge opening","This story is from January 26, 2020

Ludhiana: After lying unused for almost 12 years, there is hope that the bridge on Buddha Nullah near Pavitar Nagar may be open to traffic as a committee of councillors has been formed and members have been given one month to submit the report. This bridge has no direct access to the road because a private property falls at one of its end and a committee has been formed to find a solution to this problem and the piece of land could be acquired.

In the MC general house meeting on September 23, 2019, a proposal was made by area councillor Rashi Aggarwal that owner of the land should be given money for giving passage to connect this bridge with the road so that commuters could utilize it. The existing bridge, which is functional, is old and congested and most of the time people face traffic jams. Answering this resolution approved by the MC house, the local bodies department has asked mayor Balkar Sandhu to form a committee of councillors for taking a decision in this regard.

In this committee councillors Jai Parkash, Harbhajan Dang, Gagandeep, Kuldeep Singh, Om Parkash Ratra, Gurdeep Neetu, Rashi Aggarwal, Maninder Kaur Ghumman and Maharaj Singh are members while superintendent Surinder Pal Singh is member secretary. The committee members will visit the site and conduct meetings over the issue.

A resident of Haibowal Manish Kapoor said, “If this bridge is thrown open to traffic then we will not get stuck on other bridges over Buddha Nullah and in a few seconds we can reach Hambran Road. At present, encroachments have covered the bridge because it has no direct passage.”

Another resident of Chuharpur Road Anju Dhir said the authorities had spent money in constructing this bridge and they should have thought about making it functional as well. Now, they should not waste more time because the existing bridge also needs repair.

This bridge was constructed in 2007 and since then the population of the area has gone double and there is a lot of burden on other bridges constructed over the drain like the main bridge of Haibowal, Gopal Nagar and old bridge of Pavitar Nagar. During peak hours people face traffic jams almost daily. If this bridge gets approach and become functional, then some load of traffic will be reduced on other bridges. Even in 2010, the officials had tried to get approach from owner of the land, but it did not work at that time.

Ludhiana: A major tragedy was averted with timely action by fire-fighters when they took out an LPG cylinder that had caught fire inside a sweet shop on Gill Road on Friday night during a fire incident.

The fire had broke out at Dyal Sweets on Gill Road and owner of the shop was informed by some people of the area about it. The owner informed the firemen at the Gill Road fire station. Though the fire brigade took one hour in controlling the fire but they managed to check the spread of fire to some adjoining shops. The fire had broken out in the front side of the shop and things kept there were completely gutted in the fire but the firemen did not let the fire spread to the backside of the shop.

The sub fire officer at the Gill Road fire station, Maninder Singh, shared that the owner approached the fire brigade around 11.05pm as the shop was nearby and they reached the spot in a few seconds. He said an LPG cylinder had caught fire inside and first of all they removed that cylinder from there because at least six to seven more LPG cylinders were inside the shop. He said if that cylinder had blasted then it would have become difficult to control the fire outbreak. He said as commercial LPG cylinders were kept inside the shop fire arrangements should have been taken care of but there was no such arrangement inside the shop.

Meanwhile, people had also gathered around spot where the fire was blazing. The fire brigade controlled fire in an hour and returned but smoke could be seen billowing from the area for a long time.

Ludhiana: Getting long-term visa for United States and Canada, which are among the most sought-after foreign destinations for Indians, might actually depend on clean driving record of applicants.

These countries have sought records of applicants on traffic violations committed in their native land. Ludhiana police have already got five such request letters from embassies of the US and Canada, seeking to know whether applicants from Ludhiana commissionerate have been involved in such violations or not before granting them visa.

Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Aggarwal said in the past four months, they have got five such request letters from embassies of countries like the US and Canada over applications by Ludhiana-based residents, seeking permanent residency in the respective countries. He said since they have digital database now, they check the records and share the details of the applicants with the embassies.

Meanwhile, immigration experts said this is uncommon for any city, if such requests had been made to local police by embassies.

“Normally at the time of filing of application for visa for most countries, an applicant has to tick about whether he has a criminal record and if they (countries) later find out that one does have such record, they deport those persons. However, traffic violations cannot be taken as a ground for rejecting visa by countries, unless it leads to criminal offences like causing deaths on road etc. I haven’t heard about such instances wherein embassies have sought traffic violations report from police,” said immigration expert Ayush Jain. However, he said criminal record can be ground to deny visa to applicants.

Road safety experts linked the request letter about traffic violations with the highest fatality rate in Ludhiana.

“The embassies have sent such request letters to Ludhiana as the city is number one in the country with 68.6% fatality rate in road accidents. So, there is general concern that Ludhiana residents might not be following traffic rules and may create havoc on their roads when they come to their countries. It is good that they have asked the local police to verify driving record, including traffic violations. This move will make a lot of people follow traffic rules,” said international road safety expert Kamaljit Soi, who is member of National Road Safety Council, an apex body for road safety in India.

“The aspiring youths who want to go abroad will desist from breaking the laws. We want all the countries to inquire from police about traffic violations committed by applicants,” he added.

No request from smaller nations

A senior police officer said traffic violations alone cannot stop the embassies from issuing visa. He said they have not got any such requests from smaller countries.

In the list

Police officials said earlier police had manual data of traffic violations, so NOC was many times issued without checking the record as it was laborious process. The parameter of checking traffic violations before issuing such visa has been added recently by the embassies of these countries, they added.

Parameters

Cops said the financial statement of the applicant and no criminal record are few other parameters before the embassies issue visa.

Ludhiana: A city-based RTI activist has diverted the attention of Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) chairman Raman Balasubramanium towards the missing tin sheets put up around the construction area of the City Centre building in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar for safety of people here through a complaint on Saturday.

The activist, Arvind Sharma, who is a resident of SBS Nagar, has complained that not only these sheets are missing but the site had also started to get converted into a garbage dump. He claimed that sometimes even the streetlights do not function and this could lead to some accident at night time.

He complained that when somebody enters SBS Nagar from the T-point, it becomes risky for commuters in darkness as the tin sheets were missing and some vehicles might just crash into the structure of the City Centre and lead to some tragedy. He also complained that while entering from G-block side heaps of garbage could be seen around the site. He rued the fact that these garbage heaps might lead to some major health problem for residents of the area as they were being made to bear the foul smell. He said already due to the City Centre structure area residents had been facing many issues and even now the authorities concerned had not been able to resolve the issue.

The LIT chairman said, “I have received the complaint and even LIT is keen to take over the land but still some legal issues are pending. We have approached the senior leadership in this matter and hopefully positive results will come out.” He said he would look into the matter and see if some immediate step could be taken for public safety.

LIT has already pursued the case with local bodies minister to bring City Centre land in use as the local court case had ended and they could settle the case filed by a private firm in Delhi HC through interim resolution professional (IRP) appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal, Delhi, for fulfilling the process of insolvency.

Patiala: The Congress government in Punjab — which had just got past the crisis created by its four legislators from the home district of chief minister Amarinder Singh over the issues of corruption, phone tapping and a non-responsive bureaucracy — has again come under fire from its own MLAs.

This time, the issues are drugs and delayed development, and the revolting MLAs are Surjit Singh Dhiman from Amargarh and Amarjit Singh Sandoa, the MLA from Ropar who had defected from Aam Adami Party to the Congress ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.

Dhiman has accused government officials of being lax in dealing with the issue of drugs. The Congress legislator said people voted Congress to power as it promised to eradicate drugs from the state within four weeks. He said the fight against drugs was given a thrust initially, but the campaign had lost steam and things were back to square one.

In reply to a specific query, Dhiman said, “It is not what I want, but party workers are demoralised. I am worried this would reflect in the results of the 2022 assembly elections. For 10 years during the SAD-BJP rule, party workers faced the Akali wrath, hoping that when the Congress will return to power, things would change. But this has not happened.”

He said he had repeatedly raised the issue of drugs with the state DGP and even the chief minister, but now he was feeling that the administration was not serious in dealing with the issue. Sandoa, on the other hand, said even after joining the Congress, he was unable to arrange enough funds for the development of his constituency. “Yesterday, I raised the issue during a local event in which assembly speaker Rana KP, cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Anandpursahib MP Manish Tiwari were present. While Rana KP and Channi get enough funds for their constituencies, I had to make an appeal to the MP to allocate funds for Ropar,” he said.

Asked if he felt ignored by the state government, he said he was answerable to the people of his constituency and he was morally bound to seek overall development of his constituency. “While I want more funds for my constituency, I am also hopeful the CM will soon ensure more funds are allocated to Ropar,” he said.

475,['26/01/2020'],Punjab farmers drum up decibels to beat locusts,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Bathinda: After a few dead locusts were spotted in some Punjab areas bordering Rajasthan, the panicked farmers and horticulturists in Fazilka district are banking on ear-shattering sound power to rock the locust threat. While some are buying crackers, others have already deployed farmhands to beat utensils in the fields and to drum up the dhols to scare away some locusts that have entered Punjab. No swarm of locusts has been seen so far in Punjab but reports from adjoining Rajasthan are giving them sleepless nights.

The farmers are accusing the agriculture department of failing to foresee the danger and suggesting carrying out of aerial spraying as a pre-emptive move to handle locusts that enter Punjab.

The swarms of locusts spotted in Lalgarh and Rai Singh Nagar in Rajasthan in the last two days and sharing of video clips regarding these have further made farmers in Punjab edgy.

There were reports of locusts at the farm of Bharat Krishak Samaj chairman Ajay Vir Jakhar, who is also chairman of Punjab farmers commission, as well as that of Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar in the adjoining villages of Maujgarh and Panjkosi, located near the Rajasthan border.

The locusts were also spotted in Dekhu, Bandi, Pathrala, Raike Kalan, Pakka Kalan and Phullomithi villages in Bathinda, which are more than 50km from Rajasthan, signalling that locusts are coming to Punjab, though in small numbers. This was confirmed by Bathinda chief agriculture officer Guradiita Singh. The agriculture teams were sent to these villages on Saturday to check the ground situation, but they claimed that there was no loss to crops. Farmers in half-a-dozen Muktsar villages also claimed to have seen locusts.

Kinnow grower Ajay Wadhwa said, “Locusts have been seen at our farm in Diwankhera village. I have purchased crackers and our workers are into beating utensils on the farm to scare them.”

Ajay Vir Jakhar said, “A very large locust swarm spread over 1km was spotted on Friday night in Rai Singh Nagar in Rajasthan, which is not far from Punjab. In my farm in Maujgarh, locusts have been seen in small numbers on Kinnow trees. The locusts are a clear and present danger.”

An old-timer in Panjawa village, Karnail Singh recalled the colossal damage to cotton crop caused by the tiddi dal (locusts) in neighbouring Rajasthan in 1993 as well as in Punjab.

Agriculture department officials are in touch with Central Integrated Pest Management Centre (CIPMC) and entomology department of Punjab Agriculture University to devise a strategy to face any possible incursion.

Fazilka chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh said he had visited a score of villages, including Maujgarh, Panjkosi, Diwankhera, Panjawa and Kikar, adjacent to Rajasthan border, but they had nowhere come across any small or big group of locusts. “However, despite this, we are vigilant,” he added.

Punjab agriculture department director Sutantar Kumar Airy said that “department is on its toes and is in touch with agriculture officials of Rajasthan.”

Ludhiana: As the Ludhiana Smart City Limited (LSCL) has imposed a penalty on Tata Projects Limited for not completing the replacement of ordinary lights with LED ones, the latter has served a notice to LSCL and MC. The company has held the MC responsible for delay in the project by saying that they did not get required permissions and work orders in time. The decision regarding giving extension to the company till March end is still pending and for that mayor Balkar Sandhu has formed a committee and a meeting will take place soon.

In the house meeting on December 31, 2019, the issue was raised by councillors that the company was going very slow and there was no maintenance of streetlights. The initial deadline of the company was May 7, 2019, which was not met. The company was given three months extension but then too work was not completed.

One of the MC officials claimed that company in its notice has shifted the responsibility on MC and moreover the existing infrastructure of the city was very bad. Against a demand of Rs 64 crores for replacement of streetlights, approval was given for only Rs 13 crore.

481,['26/01/2020'],Punjab: Drug peddler held with 8kg opium gets 12 years RI,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Representative image

LUDHIANA: A local court has sentenced a drug peddler to 12 years rigorous imprisonment after he was found in possession of 8kg opium. Special court judge Arun Kumar Aggarwal also imposed a fine of Rs1.2 lakh on the convict, and in default of payment of fine, he will have to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years.

On December 30, 2014, Dugri police had booked Paramjit Singh of Sukhana village (now a resident of Dugri) and Kuldeep Singh of Hathoa village in Amargarh of Sangrur under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act for conscious possession of opium. As per prosecution, on 29 December 2014, ASI Kashmir Singh — along with ASI Raj Kumar and other police officials — were present at the 200-feet Road, Flower Chowk in Dugri, and at about 10pm, due to fog, a Honda Activa being driven by a Sikh gentleman came from the side of Pakhowal Road, who on seeing the checkpost stopped the scooter about 10 steps behind and tried to turn back. But the said person was apprehended by ASI Kashmir Singh on the basis of suspicion, with the help of other police officials. A cloth bag with black handles was lying on the scooter.

Later, police recovered 8kg opium from two transparent polythene bags within the cloth bag. Police then arrested the accused — who later disclosed his name as Kuldeep Singh — and investigated into the matter. On March 5, 2015, he was arrested from Gill Chowk, along with 20g opium. Police later presented a challan against the accused persons in the court. During trial, Paramjit pleaded false implication, while Kuldeep stated he had no relation with the former.

Additional public prosecutor for the state pleaded for punishment to the accused on the basis of prosecution evidence. The defence counsel pleaded that as per the prosecution case, recovery was allegedly effected on December 29, 2014, and in accordance with the guidelines/instructions, the sample parcel is to be deposited with the chemical examiner within a period of 72 hours in order to avoid any false implication. However, the sample parcels of this case were allegedly deposited with the chemical examiner on January 7, 2015. Thus, necessary instructions had not been followed, and the benefit was to be extended to the accused.

The court, however, did not find merit in the submission of the defence counsel, and remarked that the guidelines regarding deposit of sample parcel within 72 hours are only departmental instructions, which do not have any force of law. No such instruction is contained in the NDPS Act 1985.

The defence counsel submitted that although the alleged recovery was shown to have been effected at a public place, the police party or the investigating officer did not join any independent witness to make the prosecution case credible and genuine.

The court held that the submission of the defence counsel was devoid of any merit. Even as it convicted Paramjit, it acquitted Kuldeep, and observed that the prosecution had not been able to prove its case against him.

AMRITSAR: A video was going viral on Saturday in which a group of Sikhs were seen accusing Panthic bodies which are protesting against ‘giddha’ and ‘bhangra’ statues on Heritage Street of trying to vitiate the peaceful atmosphere of Punjab and asking the police to arrest the protesters .

The group is heard calling the issue raised by the Sikh bodies irrelevant. “These people had earlier caused much damage to Punjab in the name of Khalistan and now they are again trying to push the state into quagmire. Police should immediately arrest these people,” one of the Sikh visitors was heard saying in the video.

Meanwhile, a partial bandh was observed in Amritsar on a call given by Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar). The party’s activists, in collaboration with a few Muslims, also held a protest against CAA and NRC at Bhandari Bridge.

Similarly, in Patiala a number of unions staged a protest against the Union government on the same issue. With black stripes tied on their foreheads, the protesters took out a march in the town with national flags in their hands. The protesters raised anti-government.

SAD (Amritsar) functionaries in Patiala also staged protest. They took out a march and then staged a sit-in near Fountain chowk in the city. Former MP Dharamvira Gandhi also joined the protesters for sometime and said that the CAA was promoting hatred among the communities in India.

File photo used for representational purpose

CHANDIGARH: After launching the scheme in selective group housing societies of Faridabad and Gurgaon, electricity distribution companies are all set to expand the networking of single-point connections for the colonies, commercial centres and in the rural areas.

This comes along with the electricity distribution companies’ plans to install 10,000 prepaid smart electricity meters in the urban areas to make supply and collection of revenue more effective.

Targeted to assess real time energy consumption, Haryana discoms — UHBVN and DHBVN — plan to install meters covering its consumers in Panipat , Faridabad, Hisar and other districts by March 31.

On Monday, the full quorum of Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) headed by chairman D S Dhesi has given the go ahead for meters during the meeting held for this issue. Issues of single-point connection, prepaid electricity meters too were taken up during the meeting.

The concept of single-point connection was launched in the state in 2014 after it got the go ahead from electricity regulator HERC.

In this system, electricity distribution companies provide one connection following this the sub connections are issued by the builders or society managing the group housing. Since maintaining accounts is responsibility of society, the societies are given concession in electricity tariff in addition of being charged for bulk rates.

In November last year, the regulator had sought comments and reviews from stakeholders before planning the expansion to more area. The stakeholders had submitted their suggestions by November 28.

Sources said inadequate electricity infrastructure, linking of grid supply of the area with common maintained services by the builder or the societies were some of the issues that were highlighted. HERC will hear feedback from general public on February 6 before taking the final decision on the expansion of single-point system.

Once the system is launched in the government colonies, shopping malls and institutions, it will be also be introduced in rural areas where companies enjoy good presence.

488,['26/01/2020'],Mayor says no to vendors demand on running biz at old sites,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Ludhiana: Roadside vendors met mayor Balkar Sandhu on Saturday with their demand of allowing them to run their business as they were doing earlier and return their rehris, which had been impounded during the anti-encroachment drive. The mayor, however, refused to do so and instead asked them to start their business at the sites identified for establishing vending zones. He added that they would soon establish formal vending zones and till that time they should shift to these places. The mayor also claimed that they would not charge any fee from them until they were given proper vending zones.

The vendors had staged a protest outside zone A office on Friday, where they had met senior deputy mayor Sham Sunder Malhotra, but he had advised them to meet the mayor once and so they had met Sandhu. The vendors were asking the mayor to stop the ongoing drive being done by the police and MC because it was hitting their business. They also requested the mayor to get FIRs cancelled which had been registered against them.

Sandhu said though vending zones had not been established but they would not let these vendors lead to traffic jams at least on 12 roads, where a joint drive was going on. He said they could go to those sites where vending zones were to be established for selling things and run their business.

However, president of Rehri Farhi Union Punjab Bal Krishan Pappi said they had told the mayor about a few locations in the meeting and on Sunday he would come with vendors to check out those locations. He said the officials should give them lists of identified locations for vending zones so that they could shift there.

Meanwhile, Youth Akali Dal has demanded that police and MC should avoid strict action against street vendors and cart pullers. YAD district president Gurdeep Singh Gosha said the MC and district administration should allot vending zones in every ward instead of registering cases against poor people.

He added that they welcome the step of removing encroachments from roads but the police should not register case against the poor. Gosha said registering case was not a solution of any problem. He said if police would not stop registering cases against street vendors, then YAD would join the agitation of street vendors and cart pullers.

489,['26/01/2020'],Farmers’ body opposes Brazil president as chief guest,"This story is from January 26, 2020

Bathinda: All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) has expressed anguish at the decision of the Union government to invite Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro as the chief guest at the 71st Republic Day parade. AIKSCC said Bolsonaro was anti-farmer and government should not have invited him. A score of other organisations fighting on feminist issues too have opposed invitation to Bolsonaro.

In a press release on Saturday, AIKSCC said, “India is reeling under a very deep and sustained agrarian crisis. Sugarcane dues of more than Rs 20,000 crores are pending towards the governments across the country. While input costs of fertilisers, diesel and electricity are rising, the government has failed to ensure minimum support price at 1.5 times the cost of cultivation.”

“Even so, the government is under pressure to even further reduce prices and subsidies as a complaint has been filed by Bolsonaro-led Brazil government in the WTO against support measures given by India to its sugarcane farmers and export subsidies for sugar to companies. This they say should be reduced to less than 10% of the total value of production,” said AIKSCC working group member Darshan Pal.

The complaint also decried expanded export quota of sugar by India which it said would depress international sugar prices, he said, adding that Brazil was the biggest exporter of sugar and was one of India’s main competitor in world markets.
