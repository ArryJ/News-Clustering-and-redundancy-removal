An engineer, who decided to try his hand at cinema as a dancer and assistant director, among others, took on the mantle of producer with the Ramesh Aravind starrer, a decision he is very proud of. “I knew director Akash Srivatsa from his Badmaash days, so when he said that he had a script apt for Ramesh sir, I gave it a listen and was excited with what I heard. For a suspense thriller, the narration was different and main character sketch was novel. It seemed to be the right film to get started,” says Anup, who has produced the film along with Rekha KN for Anjanadri Cine Creations.Anup adds, “Shivaji Surathkal… is our homage to the detective genre and brings Ramesh sir back to the big screen after three years. The plot of this story can be created for a web series too. It was Ramesh sir who instructed the team to ensure this film would justify a theatrical release. Now, it is this change in treatment that has turned out to be the biggest highlight of the film.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74227177,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-141292/74227177.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/shivaji-surathkal-is-our-homage-to-the-detective-genre/articleshow/74227177.cms

Sudha was last on Kannada television on Weekend with Ramesh . On the show, Sudha will speak about her love for cooking, cooking delicacies and more. Speaking to us, Sujatha says, “It was an honour to have Sudha on the show. Considering that she dedicates much of her time to philanthropical work and writing, she admits that she rarely cooks, but grows vegetables. She also told us that her son Rohan is not a fan of her cooking. During our conversation, Sudha added that her choice of food is a simple vegetarian meal and that her favourites include poha and pickles.”On the episode, which is yet to be telecast, Sujatha treats Sudha to a unique sweet dish. “After trying the sweet, she was very keen to make it at home. Apart fromcooking, she also engaged in conversations about women empowerment, which will be an inspiration, especially for the ladies,” says Sujatha.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74227170,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-306793/74227170.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/kannada/sudha-murty-is-back-on-the-small-screen-for-a-cookery-show/articleshow/74227153.cms
2,['21/02/2020'],Kochi Times Most Desirable Man 2019: Prithviraj,"Even for someone like Prithviraj who has experienced dizzying professional highs in his 17-year career and has been equally unfazed by his successes and failures, 2019 was a standout year by his own admission. It was the year he fulfilled his long-cherished dream of turning director, and what a smashing debut he made with Lucifer , taking the box office by storm and creating a record M-Town can be proud of as he steered it into the Rs 200-crore club. He also bid goodbye to the year with yet another hit, Driving Licence It isn’t a surprise that Prithviraj’s awe-inspiring year has been capped with the Kochi Times Most Desirable Man 2019 title, through an online poll and our vote. This is the third time he has won — taking it earlier in 2012 and 2018 — and the actor-director speaks about what desirability means to him, how he manages to keep cool through it all and what we can expect next from himEvery time I have won this title, I’ve maintained that I’m not sure what exactly people find desirable about me; it might be a multitude of things or it could be nothing specific at all. I myself can’t claim to be in touch with the qualities that make me desirable, but if this title means that I, in some way, inspire someone or provide someone with direction, that is flattering to know as an artist and as a person.I think, regardless of gender, the quality that has always appealed to me is self-respect. This manifests itself in multiple ways in a person; for example, in the way you treat people around you.And I think it is very sensual to see a woman who is confident and grounded; somebody who does not aspire to be anything other than themselves.There are many women around me that I find appealing for the reason that I mentioned. I find (filmmaker) Anjali Menon very appealing, because she is a self-assured woman who has great self-respect.The same quality manifests itself in a completely different way in Nazriya, so I find her very appealing.Usually, for my roles, the stages I’ve switched between largely were either putting on or losing a bit of muscle, to look like a normal guy. I’ve been fine with that, because you end up eating more and lifting weights to go from your normal state to becoming muscular, and after the initial muscle aches are gone, it actually gives you a high. I am not going to say, ‘Oh, that’s tough’ and complain, because while it doesn’t come easy, if I have to have a beefed-up physique for a film, I know I will enjoy the process of creating that body.But for the upcoming shoot of my film, Aadujeevitham, I have to take on a thin, emaciated look. That wasn’t a process that I enjoyed, because most of all, it involved long periods of fasting. I do have a dietician, nutritionist and trainer to help me through this, but even with that, I feel weak, dehydrated and my sleep cycle is off the track. It wouldn’t be something I advise anyone to do. It’s not been fun.In terms of my career, I assume, last year, at least in public memory, would revolve around my directorial debut, Lucifer. So, if people were to take stock of my 2019, they would start with Lucifer and I am proud about that. It’s been a long-time dream to make a film of my own. Somewhere down the line, I adopted the tougher way to go about it. I’m assuming the easier way to make a directorial debut would have been to attempt a small film where what happens in a theatre would not be so much of a concern.But to make a mainstream, large-scale commercial entertainer like Lucifer, with Mohanlal playing the lead, was the tougher thing to do. You are really sticking your neck out. I knew with so much on my plate and so much invested, if I go wrong and I do not make a film that is worthy of the hype, the star cast and writer Murali Gopy, I knew that people would take me down. I knew I took a risk and I am proud of Lucifer.Post my debut, if I had to pick one year which was special to me, it has to be 2019. But what has worked in my favour is that I am not attached to my success or my failure. So, if a film becomes a success, I am happy about it and I move on quickly. In 2015, I had four back-to-back films in cinemas that were blockbusters, which I was told was a record in itself in the industry, but strangely, I am not very emotionally connected to that sort of thing. If a film becomes a big failure, I realise and understand it, and I move on. It doesn’t really matter to me.What would claw away inside of me and disturb me is if I have done a film and I walked away from it with the knowledge that I didn’t give it my all. As long as my conviction in my craft is strong enough for me to repeatedly give my 100 per cent every time I attempt a film, I am happy and cool with whatever the results are. Because the results are just a byproduct. It really can’t be the end of your journey. Of course, the means remain the same, you always try your best, but I feel you can no more longer look back and revel in the success than wallow in the despair of your failure.I don’t mind how it looks, but I can’t wait to shave, because I don’t like how it feels. It’s not something I am comfortable with it yet. And it is not a groomed look. I am supposed to just grow it out in and let it take on its own life, so that it seems as unmanageable and unkempt as I can make it for Aadujeevitham. If it looks stylish, it is completely by accident; the idea is to make it look not good.What I like about social media is that it is a medium where you can speak to people without an intermediary. When I put a video on Facebook or a picture on Instagram feed or my Twitter timeline, I am speaking directly to my followers. It is not what someone else says about me. This is great, because you are conveying what you want to without an intermediary.The other side of the coin is a bit scary, because you are speaking to a largely faceless and nameless crowd and the whole concept of anonymity that social media offers sometimes manifests itself in freedom of expression taking on its most ugly form, so there you have to build a wall and know that you are not going to be affected by this banter, whether it is positive or negative.If you want to say something, just do that, don’t engage in a conversation, which is anyway difficult for someone, like an actor, with a public profile and you have a million followers.There have been phases where I have thought I would write. I am yet to discover if I have the faculty to do something like that, but it could be something I attempt. Like directing, however, it is something that requires an investment of time, and right now that is at a premium for me. But it is something new that I could attempt.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74226264,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-368159/74226264.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/kochi-times-most-desirable-man-2019-prithviraj/articleshow/74226264.cms
3,['21/02/2020'],Shanvi Srivastava is the most desirable woman of 2019,"FacebookTwitterPintrest

The votes are in and you have chosen the Bangalore Times Most Desirable Women for 2019, from a select bunch of achievers, all under the age of 40. This time around, Shanvi Srivastava wowed audiences and beats everyone to the top. The Mumbai-based actress, who now talks Kannada like a Kannadathi, says that she considers the Kannada film industry a home away from home. Here are excerpts from a chat...It feels great, very flattering, too. I wonder what makes me desirable. Is it the fact that I’ve been open about my life and myself on social media for people to know me inside out to vote for me? If that’s the reason, I am delighted.I do not know if it has, but I’d love it if my efforts have contributed towards this. I love making people happy, which was the reason why I chose to learn the language and be a part of the culture. If that has made them happy and vote for me, I’m more than happy.If I were to look at desirability, the topmost factor would be being myself everywhere and anywhere, without pretensions. The second factor, the earnestness in the work, matters to me. Personally, I look up to Alia Bhatt as a desirable role model, because she is the same everywhere and her hard work and sincerity shows it. So, I’d consider these factors as my desirable traits too.I like the way Ayushmann Khurrana and Vicky Kaushal have turned out. They come across as real both on screen and in real life. They also go and try to realise their full potential through their varied roles, which is very attractive to me.Now, I’m exploring the actor side of me. Earlier, I was this little girl who entered showbiz and was smitten by the glam world. Now, I have decided to explore the actor in me. I’m not a trained actor, nor have I done theatre. It took me some time to sink my teeth in. I want to go beyond being just the glamour quotient and do roles that allow me to explore a different side of me.Who said I’m single... (laughs) or who said I’m committed either. Let’s keep that mysterious.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74227032,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-268127/74227032.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/shanvi-srivastava-is-the-most-desirable-woman-of-2019/articleshow/74226963.cms
4,['21/02/2020'],"6 hours of training for 7 months: Meet Arya, the ace boxer","A picture of himself that Arya posted online — a back shot of him flaunting his ripped physique — went viral on Wednesday. And yesterday, the actor shared another photo of himself and a workout video, taking the internet by storm. The rippling muscles and his lean-mean-machine avatar is for his film with Pa Ranjith , said to be titled Salpetta.“We have finished shooting 50 per cent of the film. I’m playing a boxer in it,” says Arya, refusing to reveal any more details either about the film or his role.He’s always been one of the fittest actors in Kollywood, and had even worked on his physique for some of his films, like Madrasapattinam and Kadamban. “But that’s different from what I have done for this film,” he states, “In those movies, I had to also look bulky. But for this one, I had to have lean mass.”So, how long did it take him to achieve this look? “Seven months of training, with almost six hours of workout every day,” he says matter-of-factly.Ask him to elaborate on his fitness schedule and he says, “I’d do a combination of cardio, boxing and regular gym. I would spend the mornings doing cardio for two hours. And then, I’d practise boxing for an hour- and-a-half, and follow it up with a two-hour session in the gym later in the day. I have a long list of trainers that I have to thank, without whose help I wouldn’t have achieved this physique. Some are from north Madras and some are those with whom I train regularly.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74226839,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-484994/74226839.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/6-hours-of-training-for-7-months-meet-arya-the-ace-boxer/articleshow/74226839.cms

9,['21/02/2020'],Maha Shivaratri 2020: From intense physical training to meditation: Actors' guide to portraying Shiva,"A perfectly sculpted physique with six pack abs and a chiselled frame – this was not how one would describe gods on the small screen earlier. But with Mahadev's entry in TV shows, the rules changed. Actors chosen to play Shiva were supposed to be lean, fit – a modern avatar of the god. With Shiva emerging as one of the most popular gods on the small screen, playing him became the most ambitious role for actors. From training hard to meditating for hours, they made every effort to be the 'most talked about Shiva' on television. On Mahashivratri, some of these actors who played Shiva on screen tell us why playing the god has been the most challenging role of their careers.In an earlier interview with us, Mohit Raina , who portrayed one of the most popular Shiva of the small screen in ' Devon Ka Dev Mahadev ', said that the role was a turning point in his career. ""I have spent almost a 1000 days in this role. It's been a wonderful journey. While portraying the role, my life and focal point was Mahadev. Our approach was always very personal and human. We wanted to show Lord Shiva's relationship with his wife, son and daughter, his bhakts and his mood swings as well. I know people have inhibitions before opting for mythological or period shows because they tend to get typecast. But Mahadev was a turning point in my career,"" he had said at the time. Tarun Khanna is playing Shiva for the eighth time, now on the show 'Devi Aadi Parashakti'. ""This number would have been 12 if I would not have refused some other offers,"" says the actor, who has earlier played Shiva in shows like 'Santoshi Maa', ' Karmfal Daataa Shani ' and 'Ram Siya Ke Luv Kush'.Tarun shares that over the years, he has seen how the portrayal of Mahadev has changed on screen. ""He is not just a god now, he is the hero and it is important for him to look smart. I would say that Mahadev went for a modern makeover. Earlier, actors were just asked to look divine. Now, we have to maintain a certain physique, look gentle but also look like someone who can be aggressive. That is the reason why today's Shiva appeals to all age groups. Earlier, I was playing the role of Chanakya, but to play Shiva again I had to lose 7kg in one and a half months,"" says Tarun, adding that this is his last show as Shiva.Sourabh Raaj Jain, who has been a popular face in mythological shows, says he was doubtful if he would be able to step away from playing Vishnuand play Shiva in 'Mahakaali – Anth Hi Aarambh Hai'. ""When I was offered the role of Shiva after playing Krishna in 'Mahabharat', I was surprised at how different the two roles were. They aren't just two mythological characters. No amount of previous experience in a mythological show can prepare you for the role of Shiva. For me, the first difficulty was to break my image of Vishnu and Krishna. I was doubtful if theaudience would accept me as Shiva, but I took it as a challenge and I think I succeeded to a great extent. I had to put on some muscle weight,"" says Sourabh, adding, ""My portrayal was slightly different than other shows and may be that helped me. The show was about women empowerment and how Shiva supports and motivates Parvati to fight her own battles, and the entire experience was beautiful.""Vikkas Manaktala, who played Shiva in ' Namah ', could only live his dream of playing the character for three months. But it was a challenge nonetheless. ""I used to shoot for 12-13 hours a day and spend around two hours commuting. But I would always dedicate two hours for physical training each day. My martial arts training and working out in the gym helped me get the desired physique for the role,"" says Vikkas, whorealised that maintaining a calm and composed demeanour on screen was the bigger challenge. ""To play Shiva, your expressions and attitude have to be calm. That was really difficult for me. I started meditating and that helped me get the right expressions for the role,” he says, recalling that doing taandav with 8kg of jatas on his head was the most memorable part of playing Shiva. ""To balance your head and dance with 8kg of weight was difficult. But I did that shot in one take and I take that as an achievement,"" he says.At a time when almost every mythological show has an actor playing Shiva, it was a task for Rohit Bakshi to do something different. The actor played the role of Shiva in ' Siya Ke Ram '. ""I think I got the role for my smile and had very little time to prepare for the show, so I couldn't think much about physical transformation. I decided that at a time when everyone was focusing on looks, I would focus on my body language and will keep that smile on my face. I didn't realise it would be so tough as one has to maintain that smile in every single frame, even as you talk,"" shares the actor.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74224790,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-43900/74224790.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/from-intense-physical-training-to-meditation-actors-guide-to-portraying-shiva/articleshow/74224828.cms

Called Kid Happy , the film, directed by Kris Cheppaikode and his fiancée Meghan Scibona, is a feature about Kal, a biracial American played by Naren Weiss , who travels to South India to find his father, who he has never met.“On his journey, he meets a feisty girl, Mallika, who is everything he had never imagined an Indian woman to be. I play her. The essence of the film is that he tries to find home and his true belonging with his father, but ends up doing so with Mallika,” says Krishnaa excitedly.The film, she adds, is meant for American audiences, who have a different perspective about India and its people. “Kid Happy is a biographical retelling of our director Kris’ life, with added fictional elements for cinema. This is Kris’ attempt at showing the world that India is more than just slums and cows and that it is a beautiful country,” says the actress. “Most of the film was shot in India. We were in Agumbe for three weeks, with another week’s schedule in Bengaluru. The team had another few days shoot in New York, but my role does not play out there,” she adds.So, how did this come about? “Many years ago, Kris was an apprentice to my aunt Vinaya Prasad’s late husband, Prasad. So, he knew the family and kept in touch through the years, even after Prasad’s passing. He would visit us on each of his trips to India and that is how he got to know me. A few years ago, he got to know that I was getting into acting. In fact, when he wrote the script of Kid Happy, he had me in mind while penning the character of Mallika,” she explains.The film, which is currently in post-production, is slated to do the festival circuit before making a theatrical outing.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74227087,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-150190/74227087.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/krishnaa-in-indie-film-about-a-biracial-mans-need-to-belong/articleshow/74227087.cms

The film industry has been in a state of shock and disbelief since the news of the crane crashing down on the set of Shankar’s Indian 2 and claiming three lives first broke. While three technicians died instantaneously in this horrific accident, 11 more people were injured. Lyca Productions, which is bankrolling the Kamal Haasan-starrer, released an official statement expressing their grief over this unfortunate accident and identified the three personnel who lost their lives as Krishna (assistant director), Chandran (art assistant) and Madhu (production assistant).A source from the production unit, on condition of anonymity, told us how this tragedy unfolded, “Shankar was filming a sequence with Kamal and Kajal Aggarwal at EVP Film City, when the lighting truss fell from a height. The technicians were changing the lighting when the truss got dislodged from its bearings and came crashing down. Three of those who came under the weight of the truss died on the spot, and the others were immediately rushed to Saveetha Medical Hospital. The team always has an ambulance on hand, and the injured were taken to the hospital without losing much time. Shankar, Kamal and Kajal, who were near the spot, were unhurt. The director and his team were at the hospital till everyone got discharged.”Though everyone working on the film is covered by insurance, the source also added, “Subaskaran, Chairman of Lyca, is on his way to India from the UK. There’s no way we can put a price tag on the lives that were lost, but the production house will be offering financial support to their families.”Kamal Haasan expressed his sadness on this unfortunate tragedy. He tweeted, “Although I have met and overcome several accidents, the mishap that happened today is brutal. I stand alone having lost three of my comrades. More than my pain, the anguish of their families will be several times more. I partake in their anguish as one among them. My deepest condolences to them.”When we reached out to Kajal, who was shooting with Kamal on the location that fateful night, she told us that she was “still in shock”. “Grateful to God” for her “miraculous escape”, Kajal had earlier tweeted, “Words cannot describe the heartache I feel at the unexpected, untimely loss of my colleagues from last night, Krishna, Chandran and Madhu. Sending love, strength and my deepest condolences to your families. May god give strength in this moment of desolation.”She further wrote, “In so much shock, denial, trauma from the monstrous crane accident last night. All it took was a fraction of a second to stay alive and type this tweet. Just that one moment. Gratitude. So much learning and appreciation for the value of timeand life.”We always insist that for the benefit of producers, every film crew takes insurance, but only few do that. In fact, we had even made this a rule three years ago. From what I have heard, this (Indian 2) crew had used an industrial crane and had involved non-members. This was also against our rule. Using this type of crane in a place like EVP Film City, which lacks basic facilities, was taking a huge risk. We always request film crews to shoot only with our members and equipment.— Angamuthu Shanmugam,general secretary, Film EmployeesFederation of South India (FEFSI)Electrician Selvaraj, working on the set of this Vijay-starrer in 2018, had to be rushed to the hospital when a focus light, which was hanging from a crane, fell on his head.During the second season of Bigg Boss Tamil, in 2018, AC mechanic Gunasekharan, repairing an AC that was malfunctioning, on the second floor, slipped and fell.

Former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone departs after he was sentenced to three years and four months in pri... Read More

WASHINGTON: Donald Trump 's longtime ally Roger Stone was sentenced Thursday to 40 months in prison for impeding a congressional investigation, in a case that ignited a firestorm over the US president's political interference in the justice system.

Stone, a veteran Republican operative and one of Trump's oldest confidants, was convicted in November of lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to cheat in the 2016 election.

""The truth still exists,"" said US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson as she handed down the sentence.

""The truth, still matters. Roger Stone's insistence that it doesn't, his belligerence, his pride in his own lies are a threat to our most fundamental institutions, to the very foundation of our democracy.""

Stone was not immediately sent to prison as Jackson said implementation of the sentence would be delayed while she considered his request for a new trial.

Trump sparked a scandal by decrying a ""miscarriage of justice"" after prosecutors he smeared as corrupt recommended a prison sentence of seven to nine years, in accordance with federal sentencing guidelines.

The president has also taken to Twitter to attack the jurors in the case and Jackson, who last year jailed former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort for unlawful lobbying and witness tampering.

Attorney General Bill Barr , who has been blasted for being too close to Trump, personally intervened to have the ""extreme and excessive"" recommendation withdrawn, prompting all four prosecutors to quit the case.

Trump took to Twitter to praise Barr for getting involved in the ""totally out of control"" process after a new prosecutor suggested a more lenient sentence of three to four years.

Stone is the sixth aide of Trump -- who was impeached last year for abusing his power but acquitted by the Senate -- to be convicted of charges arising from special counsel Robert Mueller 's probe into Russian election interference.

Barr said the president's comments had had no impact on his the decision, but has found himself vilified by Democrats who accuse him and the president of undermining the rule of law.

In addition, more than 2,000 former Justice Department officials have signed a statement calling for Barr to resign.

""A person should not be given special treatment in a criminal prosecution because they are a close political ally of the president,"" the open letter said.

In a rare public rebuke, Barr -- one of Trump's most staunch defenders -- said the president's Twitter pronouncements in ongoing cases were making his job ""impossible.""

""I think it's time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,"" Barr said in an interview with ABC News.

Multiple US media outlets have also reported that Barr has informed the president's inner circle that he might resign if the tweets continue.

His public attempt to distance himself from the president was met with skepticism however by critics who accuse Barr of having repeatedly acting more like the Trump's personal lawyer than a public servant.

Despite his attorney general's warning, Trump continued this week to be vocal in his support for Stone, who appeared in court in a striped suit and a polka-dot tie.

The self-avowed ""dirty trickster"" was convicted of lying in testimony to Congress about acting as an intermediary between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, which released documents hacked by Russia that embarrassed rival Hillary Clinton during the 2016 White House race.

The seven-count indictment also accused Stone of threatening an associate to stop him from cooperating with investigators.

Stone accused jury members of being biased against him and appealed to overturn their verdict.

Jackson had previously forbidden Stone from posting on social media about his trial, after he shared a picture of her on Instagram with what appeared to be the crosshairs of a gun sight.

""He was not convicted and is not being sentenced for exercising his first amendment rights, his support of the president's campaign or his policies,"" the judge said.

""He was not prosecuted, as some have complained, for standing up for the president.""

Stone, known for his flashy fashion sense, could potentially receive a presidential pardon.

""President Trump could end this travesty in an instant with a pardon, and there are indications tonight that he will do that,"" news anchor Tucker Carlson said Tuesday in a Fox News segment shared by Trump on Twitter.

The president has already commuted the sentence of nearly a dozen people this week including former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who was jailed for corruption, and a New York police chief imprisoned for tax fraud.

The flurry of clemency actions -- 11 in total -- raised expectations that Trump is considering wielding his power in more controversial cases involving close former associates, including Stone.

17,['21/02/2020'],‘India has to put in Rs 76k crore more a year to cut road deaths by 50%’,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Representational photo.

STOCKHOLM: India would require to make an additional investment of around Rs 76,300 crore annually for the next 10 years (at conversion rate of Rs 70 per US dollar) to meet the global target of reducing road fatalities by 50%, according to a new estimate released by the World Bank on Thursday.

The World Bank in its report ""Driving Road Safety in India"" has estimated that this investment will bring economic benefits equivalent annually to 3.7% of GDP.

Quoting an analysis by the bank and Bloomberg Philanthropies, the World Bank in its report report claimed that reduction in road crash fatalities and injuries by half would result in an estimated 14% increase in GDP over a period of 24 years.

The report was released in Stockholm where the Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety was held. Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday had assured the global leaders that India will meet the expectation of reducing road fatalities. He said it was a huge concern as India has 11% of all road deaths reported across the globe.

Advocating for more investment to make roads safer, the World Bank report has claimed that the estimated population welfare gains from achieving a 50% fatality reduction over this 24 year period will be equivalent to 16.3% of the GDP.

This is for the first time an estimate has been worked out projecting the benefit that India can reap by reducing the number of road fatalities. So far the discussion have been around how the annual socio-economic cost of all road accidents could be close to 3% of country’s GDP, which was based on an estimate prepared by the Planning Commission.

Hartwig Schafer, World Bank vice president for South Asia said, ""Years of rapid economic growth in South Asia, followed by a steep rise in vehicle ownership have led to mounting traffic deaths and contributed to lost economic opportunities.""

On Wednesday, Gadkari had told the global audience that India will focus on fixing the deficiencies in road engineering and stricter enforcement of traffic rules to put a brake on the high number of road fatalities.

""High number of blackspots simply shows what’s wrong with the road design,” he added.

The leaders from over 140 countries including India and its neighbouring countries participated in the global summit, which adopted the resolution to reduce road deaths by 50% in the next 10 years.

Leaders from different countries accepted that barring a couple of developed nations, all others have failed to meet the target of 50% reduction of fatalities between 2010 and 2020, which was declared as the UN Decade of Action. “We may have to take some smart actions, else we will have same results,"" said Ogla Algayerova, executive secretary of UN Economic Commission for Europe.

She added human being is the only rare species on the plant that wants to destroy themselves.

The French Embassy has witnessed many fashion events and glamorous gatherings in the past. There have been many examples of how the French have been promoting the idea of fashion diplomacy. And the latest event celebrating fashion at the embassy was a reception hosted by the French Ambassador Emmanuel Lenain for designer Rahul Mishra . Rahul recently became the first Indian designer to be welcomed as a 'guest member' on the Paris Haute Couture Calendar.Rahul displayed a few of his designs at the event to give the guests an idea about 'sustainable couture'. The designer said, ""In the early stages of my life, I was taught how design and fashion can bring some solutions and changes to society. As a designer, I make clothes and I constantly think about how the process of fashion can be a bit more inclusive and how I can promote sustainability. Therefore there's a lot of hand embroidery in my designs. If you see the French fashion history, that's what even they believed in – creating everything with their hands.""Rahul and the French Ambassador paid a special tribute to the late designer Wendell Rodricks, whose sudden demise shocked the fashion industry. The ambassador said, ""As we speak of celebrated Indian haute couturiers attached to France, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to Wendell Rodricks. He had longstanding ties with our country, where he attended fashion design courses and was invited to the Paris prêt-à-porter salon back in 2007. It may be recalled that he was conferred the 'Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et Lettres' (Knight in the National Order of Arts and Letters) in 2015.""Rahul added, ""Wendell was the one who taught me that it is the process of creation that matters. He was someone who always promoted and gave platform to young talent.""In Video: French Ambassador Emmanuel Lenain hosted a reception for designer Rahul Mishra",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74225983,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-34128,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/celebrating-indian-fashion-at-the-french-embassy/articleshow/74226108.cms

Guiding me through Chembur were many a fab Chembur-based #Foodieblinddate. Bringing me to the unique ‘Protein Rush’ were a globetrotting foodie twosome. Internationally renowned, brilliant curator of fashion trade shows in New York, Las Vegas and Miami, Raj Anand is most known for curating the Paris Fashion and home décor shows. Curating these trade shows comes naturally to his fashionable colleague Rishabha Bhandari. Not surprising that these two are regulars at this health food, high-protein mecca.Seriously small, boxed-in space. Seats maybe 14 or 16 diners. An equally tiny open kitchen and a shelf with ready-to-eat packets, tangy tomato chick peas and more.What’s common between pizzas, toasties, soups, salads, Lebanese, Indonesian and an all-day breakfast menu (oats and pancakes) is that they are all high in protein and made in olive oil. Also, free of maida, MSG, preservatives and sugar.Vegetarians, ask for the ‘Black Rice Pot Rice’, delicious with paneer and exotic vegetables. The black rice has a tasty bite to it and double the amount of protein and fibre and antioxidants than brown rice, informed the owner, Akshay Sandhu, who is always present atthe café.Chicken summer salad orange dressing is a delightful refreshing meal. Ask for the ‘Gado Gado Salad’ with peanut butter dressing. From the all-day breakfast menu, go for the tasty overnight oats. A unique dessert, ‘Pineapple Overnight’ was sparkled with oats with chia seeds. Available in many flavours.The tiny space can get cramped when packed. Service is slow. Green omlette stuffed with spinach and feta cheese could do with more punch, but its accompaniment of sweet potato chaat (beetroot option) was delicious. While ‘Desi Chicken Pizza’, rich with 100 grams of protein (base made of pulses and soya protein), is layered with pesto and pav bhaji masala, it was too bland considering it’s a “desi” chicken pizza. As Raj points out, more vegetarian options are needed.The restaurant is devoted to more than your pleasure. It is watching over your well-being. It ensures that its dishes are protein-packed and preservative, maida and sugar-free. Generously portioned.

24,['21/02/2020'],Gajraj Rao: People aren't bad. Woh 'log kya kahenge' se darte hain,"ke liye dheere-dheere waise hi karna chahiye kyunki hum toh waise hi rahenge.





One of the most striking features of 2018's National Award-winning film ' Badhaai Ho ' was the chemistry between Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao . As we meet the actors in Delhi and the two begin the interview with a 'pehle aap, nahi pehle aap', that same chemistry is evident in real life, too. They are promoting their second collaboration – ' Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan ' – which brings the duo back to the genre of a family entertainer about an unconventional subject, a homosexual son. In a candid chat with us, they talk about being the 'poster couple' for unconventional films, their evolving personal equation, and how and why mothers and fathers are different. Excerpts:I feel mothers are more accommodating towards their kids' so-called mistakes or things that are considered to be mistakes by our society. Fathers, on the other hand, are considered as cold-hearted, but that is not always the case. In our society, fathers – or boys in general – are told ""don't be a girl"" since their childhood. They say ""mard ban!"" so he has to play the role of the mard in school, college and office. But his emotions are the same as that of a mother and that is what Shankar Tripathi (his character in the film) is trying to say when he asks, ""Tumhare paas dil hai toh main kya battery se chalta hoon?"". I don't think any dialogue writer has ever a more interesting dialogue than this for a middle-class father in Hindi cinema.As a mother, I feel that he is heartless, aur inhe sirf gussa karna aata hai. Maar diya, dant diya aur kaha, 'Jao, so jao'. I also do that half the time, but I am also soft.99.9% moms aisi hi hoti hain and they will react like this if they get to know that their son or daughter is gay. Years of conservative thinking can't be changed in two minutes. Kids should also understand that they need to give time to their parents. Jaise pataate hain na inter-caste marriageAbsolutely. That is almost not a concept here. They feel, 'humare yahan gays nahin hote'. For an Indian father, their son cannot be gay. This is not a problem of the Indian or South Asian society; it is actually the problem of patriarchy. It took years to end the inhuman practice of Sati so this will also take time. It's not like people will watch this movie on Friday and then on Monday, ladke ko ladke wale dekhne aa jayenge. But it will at least start a conversation because I don't think people are bad. Log ' log kya kahenge ' ke concept se darte hain.I am a typical mother. So I did not need any preparation because I am playing a typical middle-class mother. It is a typical mother's reaction and it could also be to things like inter-caste or inter-religion marriage.I belong to Rajasthan and I have relatives there who strongly believe in traditions. Like the concept of a girl going out of the house and working is alien to many in those places. So I have references of lots of people I've have met over the years at family functions. They are not bad people, it's just that their thinking is different.Hum log filmi nahin hain. The USP of 'Badhaai Ho' was that our lines were not the typical dialogues we see in commercial films. We are relatable.We are real.Ji haan, when people meet us, me or Neena ji, they have a smile on their face, not hesitation. I met a senior citizen in the hotel and he promptly said, ""Young man, let's take a picture"". Aise treat kiya jaise apna banda hai. So that way, you can say that 'Badhaai Ho' was a turning point for us, in terms of the roles we are being offered both together and individually, too.Aur ek naturalness hai.We pull each other's leg, get angry, have tiffs. We have a large gang of friends who go out regularly. We have become like a family.100%! The preparation you need to do to bond with your co-star, we don't have to waste time on that.I don't have to worry ki inko bura toh nahin lagega. Initially it happened. The first scene we shot for 'Badhaai Ho' together was where he is lying on my lap and reading a poem. We hardly knew each other. So he came up to me and asked, ""Are you okay? Are you comfortable? Can I place my head on your lap?"" I said okay. He asked me again during the second take, ""Excuse me, can I place my head in your lap?"" He would actually ask before every take. Now, things are easy.Poles apart! There the awkwardness was because of us but here, it is because of our son. Wahan thoda hasi-mazaak tha. Here, there is taboo. There is a fear of showing your face to the society since Shankar and Sunaina Tripathi's son is gay. Naak katwa di isne. In 'Badhaai Ho', this sentiment wasn't there.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74224324,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-60530/74224324.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/gajraj-rao-people-arent-bad-woh-log-kya-kahenge-se-darte-hain/articleshow/74224317.cms
25,['21/02/2020'],"Mall speaks to musician, promises probe","This story is from February 21, 2020

A day after issuing a statement that said, ‘no physical abuse was meted out to the guest named Mr. Soumyadeep Sikdar ’, Acropolis Mall authorities have decided to probe the matter further. On Wednesday night, they posted another statement on social media, which said: ‘We have been conducting a departmental enquiry on the incident’. Following CT’s report on the incident , the mall on Thursday even reached out to the musician, who had alleged physical assault by the mall’s security personnel following an altercation over being denied a socket to charge his phone at the food court.

“We invited Soumyadeep to our mall, but he said he was out of the city. So, we reached out to him on the phone. We have assured him that an enquiry into the matter is being conducted. We’ve never faced any such incident in the past and will surely take action against the offender,” an Acropolis Mall spokesperson told CT.

Confirming that he received a call from the mall, Soumyadeep said, “They have apologised and assured me that if any bit of my claim is found to be true, the authorities will take action. The woman on the phone also promised that the result of the enquiry will be emailed to me. I explained my ordeal to her.” Though the Sufi singer is now looking for closure, he is still bemused by the silent spectators of the incident.

No one from the mall has any right to beat up visitors even if the said person has done something wrong. I’m shocked that no one came forward to help me. This could have happened with one of them too. However, I want the matter to end once those guilty are punished. I hope no one else has to face the treatment that was meted out to me — not even those who remained silent spectators when I was being heckled,” Soumyadeep said.

Meanwhile, a separate statement was emailed to CT on Thursday by the mall authorities to clarify their stance. “Considering the outcome we will definitely take necessary steps against the staff, if we find them guilty. There can be individual acts which surely does not define our intention to run the mall ! There are daily briefings which take place to ensure such incidents doesn't occur. (In spite of these precautions it is quite unfortunate that such an incident occurred at our mall.)

26,['21/02/2020'],Aanand L Rai: I want to be fearless as a person and as a filmmaker,"Over the past 13 years since he entered Bollywood, Aanand L Rai has donned both hats with elan — that of a prolific producer and a fine director. And now, he is excited about his latest release, Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan , which he has co-produced with Bhushan Kumar. The film, starring Ayushmann Khurrana and Jitendra Kumar as the lead romantic pair, deals with the subject of homosexuality in a light-hearted manner. As the movie hits theatres today, Rai talks to BT about being in love with his films, the emotional support he seeks from his actors, and how a serious subject like that of Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, needs to be told through a heavy dose of humour.When we started working on this subject, Section 377 had not been scrapped. The verdict came during the course of the film and we had to tweak our climax because of it. The reason I decided to make Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan is different.As a filmmaker, I felt the need to understand their world. There was a time when I wasn’t able to understand the universe of Tanu Weds Manu (2011) and Raanjhanaa (2013). Jaise hi mujhe iss topic pe kuch samajh aaya, I thought of sharing it with the audience. As a team, we really wanted to work on this subject, especially when Hitesh Kewalya (writer-director) came up with a good script. It all started with Shubh Mangal Saavdhan (2017), when we presented a subject like erectile dysfunction to the family audience. The idea of the franchise is to bring all the topics that are discussed behind closed doors into people’s drawing rooms. It is all about how you make them family entertainers. Ayushmann knew that we were working on this subject, and he got sold on the idea the moment he heard the script.The film is not about the romance between two men, it is about the society accepting two men involved in a romantic relationship. Hum logon ko lagta hai ki yeh unki problem hai, par actually problem hamari hai. It is our problem that we don’t understand a human relationship like this. So, the only way to reach out to the audience, with a heavy subject like this, is through a good dose of humour.I would say that my films are set in middle-class settings, not small towns. I understand that world much better. That’s the way I have been brought up and it reflects in my movies. Today, I might be a filmmaker, living in a bigger home, driving a bigger car, but I will always remember my upbringing. I was born and brought up in Delhi, in a middle-class family. My mom was a fine arts teacher in a government school. I remember growing up in a government colony. So, be it Lucknow, Kanpur or Haridwar, the backdrop of my film will always bemiddle class.It is not easy to get a script for an actor who you understand so well. I am just waiting for the right script to direct him. My process is different — I first fall in love with the story and then decide upon the actor. However, we have discussed the idea of working together as a director-actor. He is looking forward to a pure romance or a pure action film. I told him action toh nahi, magar pure romance pe kuch soch sakte hai.Like I said, I am a director who falls in love with his stories and that encourages me to make a film. I think I was in awe of Zero, I was madly in love with it. I think I overdid it. Bolte hai na, zyada pyaar bachche ko bigaad deta hai. I think this is what happened with Zero, but the experience taught me a lot. As far as my association with Khan saab (SRK) is concerned, I will relish it all through my life. I got a partner in him, so it was never a star I worked with. He was an emotional partner, who gave me a lot of support. I am not a craftsman, so I need emotional support every time I make a film. When I was working with Khan saab, he never made me feel like it was such a huge film. He made me believe in my story, and made me go through the journey the way I wanted to. However, like it happens after the release of every film of mine, I went silent post the release of Zero, too. That is all. Our association was not affected by the film’s box-office performance. I think silence is the best way to take both,success or failure. Just go quiet. Absorb. Learn. Understand.I won’t be careless. In fact, I have never been careless in my life. I was always a good student, and will remain a good student throughout my life. No experience has disturbed me as such, it has only made me understand a few things. So, I am looking at playing my innings the same way, I have been playing since the last 10-15 years. I can’t change myself. I am fearless. Once again, I am in love with my film and my story and I am enjoying it. I want to be fearless as a person, and as a filmmaker.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74225378,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-83292/74225378.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/aanand-l-rai-i-want-to-be-fearless-as-a-person-and-as-a-filmmaker/articleshow/74225378.cms
27,['21/02/2020'],Aanand L Rai: 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan' is about conversation between two generations,"His filmography is an ode to India's heartland. And with ' Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan ', Aanand L Rai is continuing that love story. The filmmaker tells us why he chose to set another film in a small city, why this had to be a family film and why he brought Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao back together on the screen. Excerpts:'Shubh Mangal Saavdhan' was a very taboo topic – talking about erectile dysfunction. But I always saw that as a family film. For me, it was not just about erectile dysfunction, it was about these two generations, from the middle class, and the conversations between them. My reason to make the film was ki bahut saari baton mein ek communication gap aa jata hai, woh hatna chahiye. And I thought, if this goes well, we should come up with more topics and make these two generations come closer and have more communication, let's make this into a series – pick up a topic and bring these generations closer, talking about things, making each other understand about their point of view.Even this film, it's not about gay relationships. It's about people like us, who are a little homophobic. It's a conversation between these two generations. And I always believe, that the younger generation is more clear and less judgmental about things, which I really like.I definitely believe that it is changing. It's a very progressive India. We are growing as a country, we are opening up. We were different 50 years ago, changed a little 25 years ago, then 10 years ago and now we will change more.In 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan' you will see Ayushmann not playing a victim. In his previous films, in one way or another, he was playing a victim. But in this film he is a voice, a strong voice. He is very clear with his thoughts.We always knew that we are dealing with a difficult space. So this was like… putting a sugar coating on a bitter medicine. Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta are that sugar coating in a subject like this. I wanted those faces, those actors, that talent, who can… when you look at them, you feel like yeh toh apne hi hain, you know? With a subject like this, I needed them to bring the audience in front of the screen, ki ab humse ye kahani suno. But when you see them on screen, they are definitely not the same couple you saw in 'Badhaai Ho'. They are such brilliant actors that they changed themselves in 30 seconds for this setting. But that lovability you cannot take away, you will fall in love with them all over again.I am not choosing the locations. I am choosing the world. Talking about a gay relationship in a Allahabad is quite different from talking about a gay relationship in Mumbai. Maybe my daughter, who is born and brought up in Mumbai, sees LGBTQ relationships differently than what I used to think when I was studying. The changing dynamics is pushing me further inside India, because that’s where my country is living. So setting it in Kanpur or Allahabad or Meerut, actually makes my stories live better.Definitely you can set it there. But if I want to connect with a larger audience, where it is affecting, then I shouldn't. It is a different kind of writing, when you are writing about a couple that has lived in Mumbai for 20 years and when you are writing about a couple who has been living in Saharanpur for the last 20 years. It is not just about the setting, it's about the life they have lived.I needed someone who looks vulnerable. He should look a part of the family and a boy who takes time to decide. And Jeetu is a fine actor, he understood those nuances and playing someone you are not. Anyway as an actor you play different roles, but here it was a major thing, you have to change the psyche, understanding that perspective and emote accordingly.

But it has moved into other flavours, too. And a trend is seeing the Far Eastern bao being infused with flavours of India! Affirms corporate chef Onkar Samarth, “I love the bao, it’s one of my favourites. I’ve used a different ingredients in the fillings, not just Oriental. I’ve made Maharashtrian baos such as a Sauji masala bao, a South-Indian style kathal bao (jackfruit) and a puran poli bao; it turned out great.”Chef Rakesh Talwar has given the bao a Rajasthani twist. “I have added laal maas to the filling and the bao complemented the spice of the laal maas,” he says.When it comes to desserts, restaurateur Neelam Saini Sircar, says the bao is an opportunity to get creative. “I’d do a raspberry- kalakand bao. The bao holds the kalakand (made of chenna) and raspberry well. I’d call it a progressive dessert. It may also be a great idea to do a beetroot halwa bao.”Talk about Instagrammable desserts! Just as one can create latte art, the trend here is to create similar cute designs on baos. One can make everything from minions to create characters like Hello Kitty to Minions, pandas and Angry Birds. It’s done using edible food colouring for the face and custard, red bean paste and sweet potato for the stuffing. Kids will love it.Soft, round baos are steamed in bamboo baskets.

30,['21/02/2020'],Govt move may lower creamy layer threshold,"This story is from February 21, 2020

File photo used for representational purposes only.

NEW DELHI: Proposing a major change in the concept of ‘ creamy layer ’ for OBCs, the government may rule that ‘salary’ be considered a part of ‘gross income ’ to decide if a backward class individual is eligible to avail Mandal reservations in public employment and education.

Top sources in the ministry of social justice and empowerment said inclusion of salary in calculating the creamy layer for OBCs was decided as per the recommendations of an expert committee. A proposal to this effect is likely to be moved for the government’s consideration.

If the move goes through, it will significantly raise the bar to qualify for the 27% quota benefits as more are likely to be excluded as ‘creamy layer’ — the cut-off that rules an OBC as affluent.

As per the guiding 1993 Office Memorandum on creamy layer, ‘salary’ and ‘agricultural income’ are not included in ‘gross income’ which only comprises ‘income from other sources’. In contrast, factoring in salary would make it much easier to qualify an OBC as affluent. Observers believe the decision will be controversial with the backward castes.

While the 1993 OM is clear on the subject, confusion arose after the Centre, over the last six years, started including salary in case of OBCs from PSU backgrounds while continuing to exclude it for those working in state and central governments.

It lowered the bar for disqualification from quota in case of the first category and triggered court battles. Madras and Delhi High Courts termed the practice “discriminatory” and asked the Centre to remedy the situation in favour of OBCs from PSU backgrounds.

An expert committee was appointed in March 2019 to resolve the situation. As reported by TOI, the panel suggested that the Income Tax Act be made the benchmark to calculate the creamy layer cut-off for all OBCs across the board. The I-T Act includes ‘salary’ and ‘other sources’ but leaves out ‘agri income’.

According to sources, the social justice ministry has also decided to review the income ceiling for creamy layer, as is mandatorily done every three years and was last effected in 2017.

The expert panel is learnt to have recommended that income ceiling should be ‘indexed’ to a fixed parameter to decide the quantum of raise, as against the subjective revision done till now.

While a final decision has not yet been taken, sources said the income ceiling could be increased from the present Rs 8 lakh per annum to above Rs 11 lakh.

31,['21/02/2020'],CAA major ‘downturn in India’s religious freedom’: US Cong body,"This story is from February 21, 2020

NEW DELHI: Ahead of President Donald Trump ’s visit, a bipartisan US federal government entity which has often clashed with the Indian government in the past issued a ‘factsheet’ on why the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) represents a significant downturn in religious freedom in India.

The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) said Muslims alone would suffer from the National Register of Citizens (NRC) as non-Muslims would be ensured protection by the CAA. While it linked CAA and NRC, as of now, the Indian government has said that NRC was not under discussion.

In December last year, the USCIRF, established by the US Congress to monitor threats to religious freedom abroad, had said the law was “a dangerous turn in the wrong direction; it runs counter to India’s rich history of secular pluralism and the Indian Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law regardless of faith”. It had sought sanctions against home minister Amit Shah and other “principal leadership’’ of the law, which was then before Parliament as a bill.

The ’factsheet’ concluded that the NRC process in Assam and challenges plaguing it demonstrated that Indian citizens could be stripped of their citizenship in a nationwide NRC. “With protections for non-Muslims in place under the CAA, however, any future NRC process would largely impact Muslims alone,’’ it said.

According to the USCIRF, the law essentially granted individuals of selected non-Muslim communities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan refugee status within India and reserved the category of “illegal migrant” for Muslims alone.

Indian officials here said the CAA should be appreciated by those genuinely interested in religious freedom as it addressed the human rights of persecuted religious minorities who were not in a position to return to their homes.

While referring to Shah’s remark in Parliament that the CAA was only meant to protect those who had suffered from religious persecution in neighbouring states, the USCIRF said the Act did not require members of the listed non-Muslim religious groups to provide any proof of persecution and omitted Muslim minority communities such as Shias and Ahmadiyas who faced severe persecution in Afghanistan and Pakistan due to their faith.

While it recalled PM Narendra Modi ’s statement that there had been no discussion in the government on NRC, the USCIRF mentioned Shah’s contradictory statements and also BJP’s 2019 manifesto which called for NRC in other parts of the country in a phased manner.

The ‘factsheet’ further said there were serious concerns that the CAA served as a protective measure for non-Muslims in case of exclusion from a nationwide NRC — a proposed list of all Indian citizens — and that was evident from the rhetoric of BJP politicians.

“The CAA and NRC must also be understood in the context of the growing prominence of BJP’s Hindutva ideology. This ideological frame views India as a Hindu state (with its definition of Hinduism inclusive of Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs) and Islam as a foreign and invading religion,” it said.

NEW DELHI: Air India has extended the suspension of its China flights by another three months to June-end in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic. The flights were earlier suspended till March 28.

“Flights to Shanghai and Hong Kong are further cancelled till June 30,” an AI spokesman said on Thursday. The national airline has a daily flight on the Delhi-Hong Kong route and six times a week from Delhi to Shanghai.

IndiGo and SpiceJet, the other Indian carriers that fly to mainland China and Hong Kong, have not commented on whether they will extended the suspension beyond February-end. SpiceJet has a daily Delhi-Hong Kong flight. IndiGo has suspended its three dailies: Delhi-Chengdu, Bengaluru-Hong Kong and Kolkata-Guangzhou.

Hong Kong’s flag carrier Cathay Pacific has reduced flights to India from 49 weekly flights to 36 till March 29, 2020, apart from significantly cutting its overall schedule due to reduced travel demand. Among Chinese carriers, Shandong Airlines and Air China have suspended their flights to India. China Southern has reduced flights.

Singapore Airlines and its regional arm SilkAir have “temporarily reduced services across (their) network due to weak demand as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak”. As part of this, SIA’s Mumbai flights and SilkAir’s Kochi connections have been reduced for March. The cancelled flights include Singapore-Mumbai (SQ 426) of March 7, 14, 21 and 28; and Mumbai-Singapore (SQ 425) of March 8, 15, 22 and 29.

Representational photo.

NEW DELHI: The GMR Group — India’s biggest private airport infra player — has picked Groupe ADP, formerly Aéroports de Paris , over a Tata Group-headed consortium to sell 49% stake in GMR Airports Limited (GAL) for Rs 10,780 crore. The deal, which values GMR Airports at Rs 22,000 crore, will see GAL getting Rs 5,248 crore immediately. Groupe ADP develops and manages airports, including Paris’s Charles de Gaulle , Orly and Le Bourget.

Last March, GIL had announced that a consortium of Tatas, GIC and SSG Capital Management will invest Rs 8,000 crore in GAL, valuing GMR Airports at almost Rs 22,500 crore. However, since Tata Group operates two airlines — Vistara and AirAsia India — airlines had been opposing its entry into the airport business.

In fact, now both the existing and upcoming airports of Delhi will have a strong European connection — ADP for Delhi and Flughafen Zurich, which is developing Greater Noida. Based on 2019 passenger statistics, the combined passengers handled by GMR Airports and Groupe ADP was 33.6 crore, the highest in the world.

Groupe ADP’s Rs 10,780-crore equity consideration, GMR Infra Limited said in a BSE filing, comprises of Rs 9,780 crore towards secondary sale of shares by GMR Group and Rs 1,000 crore equity infusion in GAL. “Groupe ADP has also pegged earn-outs up to Rs 4,475 crore linked to achievement of certain agreed operating performance metrics as well as on receipt of certain regulatory clarifications over the next five years. Thereby, total valuation, assuming all above earn-outs are successfully consummated, may reach Rs 26,475 crore on post-money basis. The first tranche of Rs. 5,248 crore will be received by GMR Group immediately. This money will help deleverage the group further and result in improved cash flows and profitability,” the GIL regulatory filing said.

It added that “as part of the terms of transaction, GMR will retain management control over the airports business with Groupe ADP having the customary rights and board representation at GAL and its key subsidiaries”.

GMR Group chairman G M Rao said: “The partnership with Groupe ADP is in line with GMR’s business direction to become a global airport developer and operator. We have been on a journey of defining airports of the future with key focus on passenger experience by leveraging enhanced technology and offering superior amenities. With Groupe ADP, GMR will have smoother access to global markets, opening up newer avenues of business growth.”

Aéroports de Paris SA-Groupe ADP chairman and CEO Augustin de Romanet said: “The acquisition of a 49% stake in GMR Airports fits within Groupe ADP’s strategy. It sets a robust industrial partnership and enables Groupe ADP to build, only two years after taking control of TAV Airports, a unique worldwide network of airports with a solid industrial expertise and strong development capacities. This acquisition will constitute a growth driver in the medium term, and also a transforming position for the group in one of Asia’s and the world’s most dynamic and promising countries.”

35,['21/02/2020'],Word ‘nationalism’ isn’t viewed positively these days: RSS chief,"RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat

RANCHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday said the term “nationalism” had acquired a negative connotation in a large part of the world because of its association with Hitler , Nazism and Fascism even as he asserted that India needed to become a great nation to tackle the challenges of radicalism and climate change.“These days, nationalism is not viewed positively,” Bhagwat told a gathering of RSS workers at Shyama Prasad Mukherjee University, recalling his conversation with an RSS worker in the UK who advised him to refrain from using nationalism.“A few years ago, I was on a visit to Britain and having a discussion with a few intellectuals and our functionaries. A karyakarta advised me not to used the word ‘nationalism’ as English is not our language and it takes on a different meaning in England. He said it is okay to say ‘nation’, ‘national’ and ‘nationality’, but not ‘nationalism’ as it alludes to Hitler, Nazism and Fascism (in England),” he said.Bhagwat traced the misgivings about nationalism to the conduct of superpowers globally even as he emphasised India’s distinctness. “Unlike India which has never been inclined to become powerful for its own sake, many other countries, including today’s superpowers, have used their power to seek to become global hegemons. They exploit the resources of the entire world and directly and indirectly use their power to exercise power over the entire world and cast it in their own mould. This happened in the past and is the reality even now. That is why intellectuals in a large part of the world think that a powerful nation spells threat to the world,” he said.The comments of the RSS chief, who is on a five-day tour of Jharkhand, are significant because of the Sangh’s ideology of cultural nationalism. Sangh and its affiliates pride themselves for their “fierce nationalism” and have never been deterred by the accusations of exclusivism or chauvinism.In his address, Bhagwat was all praise for India as the only country with the potential to deal with what he called the twin threats of disruption to world peace — radicalism and climate change. “India alone has the potential to address these issues holistically. The world waits for India, so India has to become a great nation. The aim of RSS is nothing more than uniting Hindu society. It does not mean that Sangh interferes in the federal system of the country. The swayamsevaks are dedicated to their aim. By feeling proud of the culture of our country we have to work to take the country to new heights. We have to make India a world guru,"" he said.Bhagwat said Sangh founder K B Hedgewar was involved in every movement including social reforms during the freedom struggle. He formed the RSS so that social evils that took hold during 1,500 years of foreign rule could be eradicated and eternally relevant values like selflessness, non-discrimination and equality were established.Calling upon RSS members to connect with people irrespective of their caste, language, religion or region, Bhagwat said India was predisposed to fasten everyone with one thread on the principle of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (the world is a family). “We live for each other, not for ourselves. We believe that the world has made us and we have to give back to it and we look at the world with gratitude,” he said.Former Jharkhand CM Raghubar Das , former urban development and transport minister C P Singh, former MP Ravindra Rai and BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Samir Oraon attended the gathering.

DUBAI: Top seed Simona Halep had to come from behind for a second straight day on Thursday, overhauling Aryna Sabalenka 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 to reach the Dubai Championships semi-finals.

Halep, who had saved a match point in knocking out Ons Jabeur 24 hours earlier, said she had to pick up her pace after losing the first set.

""Everything was a little bit fast, too powerful. When I got the rhythm, it was much easier for me to feel the game,"" said the world number two.

""I played quicker in the second and third set. She didn't have time to hit the ball. I think that was the key of the match.

""It's good to have tough matches. I'm here to give everything I have to win every match I play. I'm happy with these matches.""

The Romanian star will face Jennifer Brady on Friday for a place in the final.

US qualifier Brady, who beat third seed Elina Svitolina in the first round, booked her last-four spot by dispatching ninth seed Garbine Muguruza , 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 6-4.

Elena Rybakina claimed a season-leading 18th victory with a 7-6 (7/1) 6-3 win over second seed Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic.

The Kazakh winner has been on a tear in 2020, winning the Hobart trophy and playing finals in Shenzhen and last weekend in St Petersburg.

Rybakina will Friday face Petra Martic after the Croatian eighth seed defeated Anett Kontaveit of Estonia 7-6 (7/4), 6-1.

As she had on Wednesday, when playing Tunisian wildcard Jabeur, Halep had to fight her way out of a deficit after losing the opening set.

The 2015 Dubai champion lifted her game to win the second set and ran off to a 4-1 lead in the final set before finishing off the night three games later.

Victory avenged the loss Halep suffered against Sabalenka last month in Adelaide.

Brady, who ranks just outside the Top 50, has stunned herself with her form this week.

""I was able to find a way, I wasn't feeling my best,"" she said after seeing off Muguruza.

""Maybe I didn't play my best tennis, but I stayed in there, competed and came out on top.""

Brady recovered from a set down against the two-time Grand Slam winner from Spain, winning the second set by breaking her opponent's last two serves.

She finished off the upset a set later on a second match point.

""I had so many opportunities, I can't count how many I had. They didn't go my way,"" said Australian Open runner-up Muguruza who converted on only one of 10 break points.

""Every time I had an opportunity, she was playing the point well, serving big, making winners.""

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court-appointed mediators on Shaheen Bagh told the protesters on Thursday how the issue of the road blockade is resolved may have a bearing on how SC considers the “larger issue” ( CAA ), including how other such protests are seen.Addressing the protesters, lawyer Sanjay Hegde said, ""Bada masla aayega toh hamari baat aur achhe se sunegi SC. Ye waqt ki nazukta samjhiye (When the larger issue comes to court, SC will listen to us even more keenly. Understand the delicateness of the situation).”At the end of the day, there was no breakthrough and the mediators will return to the site on Friday.The two mediators — Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran — kept stressing that the isssue on which they were asked to engage in a dialogue was about the inconvenience being caused to commuters due to the road blockade and not the citizenship law. When the mediators asked the crowd, “Who all trust SC?”, the unanimous response was: “All of us.” But when the senior lawyers suggested that they could move to an alternative site, the crowd cried, “Nahi ho sakta (It can’t happen).”The suggestion of an alternative site was countered by the women with the argument that when the JP movement or the Mandal or Anna protests took place, no one had expressed any outrage over inconvenience being caused. “It's been made to look like a Muslim andolan. This area is just 150 metres long. UP police and Delhi Police have shut the routes that could be opened,” one of them said.The protesters claimed they were not the ones blocking the road and that the alternative routes could ease the situation. Responding to this, the interlocutors took the help of some locals to inspect three alternative routes — Mahamaya, Supernova and Kalindi — that the protesters said had been blocked by the police.The mediators told the crowd that “Shaheen Bagh barkarar rahega” (Shaheen Bagh will survive) but it was necessary to ensure that others were not inconvenienced. “Nobody should be troubled. We live in this country to help one another and not trouble each other. The movement will be an example for everyone. The protest should go on but its venue could be a place where people are not troubled,” they said. “If people in Noida say that we'll sit on DND or elsewhere, then it's not good for anyone.""On the second day of the dialogue, the crowd swelled. At one point, Ramachandran observed that the chaos at the site had made the atmosphere “inconducive”. She said, “We won’t come tomorrow if this persists.” An apology followed the remark and the dialogue continued. Half an hour into the interaction, the mediators objected to TV channels “meddling” with the dialogue process. On their suggestion, these mediapersons were asked to vacate the venue and the women applauded the move.One of the protesting women agreed with the idea of a census but not CAA and NRC which, according to them, discriminated against a particular community. “We are ready for a census. It should happen. You know and we also know that we are Indians. Lal Qila, Jama Masjid and Qutub Minar are examples of our existence,” said the woman.The mediators stressed that the mothers and daughters of the country were actually “Bharat Mata...The nation progresses only when they’re happy"". A woman interjected with: “The problem is that you are saying it but our PM doesn't say it. We are ready to hug him. He's our PM. He should come.”Hegde observed that India had seen several prime ministers in the past 70 years. “Whoever assumes office is entrusted with responsibility. They're sometimes right, sometimes wrong. We can't say that a PM can never be wrong. If we feel there is an issue, we have the right to raise it. That's why the SC is there. Whenever SC speaks, everybody listens,” said Hegde.Some of the women expressed anxiety over the government taking up issues like triple talaq but not lending an ear though they had been on the road for so long. “The moment they take away the law, we'll leave,” said one of the women.The protesters pointed out that even during BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani ’s rathyatra, there were traffic jams. “That happened during the Jat agitation too. We are protesting peacefully without trouble. Shaheen Bagh is our identity. If we move from here, we'll lose our identity. We are fighting for our existence. We are also citizens of this country,” the mediators were told.The lawyers tried to assure the protesters that the matter of citizenship law will be argued by taking into account people’s rights. “When the hearing on this law takes place, lawyers from Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and Christian communities will argue with all their might. But before that happens, the stand that “we'll keep sitting here” needs to change. “It was very easy for SC to direct the government but the judge also considered the current situation...They've also reached out to you but there has to be some reciprocation,” they said.“On the day that some people threatened to vacate us, thousands of people turned up here to protect us. They had no religion. But we have been labelled as a Muslim crowd. We are more than that. We are fighting for our country,” said Shaheen Kauser .A single father, Imran, who had reached the site with his two daughters broke down, citing the fear of detention centres. “My youngest daughter is in Class I but she also knows what NRC means. The fear is extremely real for all of us,” he said.“Why is road closure a bigger issue than the future of thousands of citizens of this country?” asked another protester, Shabnam. “Shouldn’t our judges listen to our concerns and ask the government to assure us that NRC and NPR won’t be implemented?”“Shaheen Bagh has become our identity now. It’s the mother of all the protests. We can’t just give up and leave,” said another protester.In Video: Shaheen Bagh will stay, mediators assure protestors on second day of negotiation",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74234081,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-387904,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-will-listen-more-keenly-if-road-block-issue-resolved/articleshow/74233753.cms

BRUGES: Anthony Martial struck a crucial away goal as Manchester United ground out a 1-1 draw against Club Brugge in Belgium on Thursday in the first leg of their Europa League last 32 tie.

Nigerian forward Emmanuel Dennis lobbed a stranded Sergio Romero from 30 yards to give Belgian league leaders Brugge the lead on 15 minutes at a chilly, rainswept Jan Breydelstadion.

Martial though hauled United level before half-time with an excellent run and finish after pouncing on a defensive lapse from Brandon Mechele.

United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made six changes to the side that beat Chelsea on Monday, with Romero handed another start in Europe while Victor Lindelof returned from illness to form a three-man defence alongside Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw. New signing Odion Ighalo again began on the bench.

Brugge coach Philippe Clement, once of Coventry City, handed a European debut to 19-year-old Maxim De Cuyper with captain Ruud Vormer only fit enough to start among the substitutes.

De Cuyper nearly popped up with a goal inside three minutes when Dennis escaped Maguire and skipped towards Romero, his attempt to pull back resulting in Nemanja Matic hooking against the teenager and the ball ricocheting fortuitously over the bar.

Andreas Pereira, United's Belgium-born Brazilian midfielder, saw a low 20-yard drive tipped behind by Simon Mignolet, with the Brugge goalkeeper setting Dennis up for the opener moments later.

A long kick forward caught United short in defence and Dennis, who scored twice against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in October, outmuscled Brandon Williams before lofting over Romero with the Argentine well off his line.

An increasingly ragged United were fortunate not to fall further behind when Mats Rits scuffed wide before Romero positioned himself expertly to keep out Dennis from a tough angle.

Brugge then paid a heavy price when Mechele allowed a bouncing ball to run beyond him, an alert Martial seizing on the opening to race clear and steer calmly beyond Mignolet.

Martial almost bagged a quickfire second as he smacked the post just before the interval, Mignolet extending a vital hand to divert the Frenchman's curling strike just outside the penalty area.

Brugge will be without Eder Balanta for the return leg at Old Trafford next week after he was booked for a foul on Juan Mata , and the Colombian was replaced by Vormer early in the second half.

Jesse Lingard stabbed wide while lunging to reach a teasing ball from Diogo Dalot before Dennis was again denied by Romero from a tricky position.

Odilon Kossounou squandered a superb chance to put Brugge back on top when he scuffed wide following terrific work on the right from Dennis and a clever dummy from Siebe Schrijvers.

Bruno Fernandes injected fresh life into United as he was introduced for the final 10 minutes, and although the 2017 champions were unable to land a knockout blow they will fancy their chances of finishing off the tie on home soil.

Celtic keeper Fraser Forster saved a late Jens Stage penalty as the Scottish champions drew 1-1 away to FC Copenhagen after Odsonne Edouard's opener was cancelled by an effort from Senegalese striker Dame N'Doye.

La Liga surprise package Getafe defeated last season's Champions League semi-finalists Ajax 2-0 in Spain with Brazilian duo Deyverson and Kenedy on target.

Christian Eriksen bagged his first Inter Milan goal in a 2-0 win away to Ludogorets of Bulgaria. Romelu Lukaku added a late second from the spot.

Record five-time winners Sevilla needed an 82nd-minute equaliser from January arrival Youssef En-Nesyri to salvage a 1-1 draw away to Romanians Cluj.

42,['21/02/2020'],"After Bhuj strip-check row, Surat trainees forced to stand naked for med test","This story is from February 21, 2020

SMIMER hospital, where the ‘fitness tests’ were conducted

SURAT: Barely a week after 68 students of a Bhuj girls' college were lined up and forced to strip to prove they weren't menstruating, female trainee clerks of the Surat Municipal Corporation were on Thursday allegedly made to stand naked in a state-run hospital for a long time while lady doctors subjected them to a gynaecological finger test and asked personal questions.

According to a complaint lodged by the SMC Employees’ Union with the municipal commissioner, around 100 employees got a rude shock when they reached the Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research for their mandatory fitness test. ""Female employees were forced to stand naked together in groups of around 10 in a room where they did not have any privacy. The door was not properly closed and the only thing blocking the view from outside was a curtain,"" said a senior corporation employee in whom one of the women confided.

Besides being subjected to the controversial finger test, even unmarried women were allegedly asked if they had ever been pregnant. Some of the women accused the lady doctors who conducted the gynaecological tests of also behaving rudely with them.

Male trainees had to undergo a general fitness assessment that included eye, ENT, heart and lung tests, besides an overall check-up. The fitness test is mandatory for confirmation of an employee's service on completion of the three-year probation.

""The issue was brought to the knowledge of SMCEU by a few trainee women employees out of the nearly 400 whose services will be regularised this year. On hearing about their trauma, we demand an immediate halt to such insulting and inhuman tests. I have never heard such a test on women employees anywhere else,"" said AA Shaikh, general secretary of the employees' union.

Shaikh alleged that doctors performing the finger test on women in a group was demeaning. ""If they (doctors) had any doubt about an employee’s health, they should have got tests done in an acceptable manner. Asking even unmarried women about past pregnancies is downright insulting.""

Ashwin Vachhani, head of the gynaecology department at the hospital, said: ""We have to examine women physically since it is mandatory as per the guidelines. I don't know if such tests are done on men, but in the case of women, we follow rules to find out if they have any specific illness.""

A 45-year-old female employee said she had taken a fitness test around 20 years ago, but it did not involve any such procedure.

""I have received a complaint from the SMCEU. It will be sent to the superintendent of the hospital. After proper inquiry, they will submit a report to the municipal commissioner,"" said A K Naik, deputy municipal commissioner (health).

43,['21/02/2020'],"Army ready with roadmap to grant permanent commission to women, will seek responses from eligible officers","This story is from February 21, 2020

NEW DELHI: Swinging into action after the Supreme Court judgement on Monday, the Army has prepared a roadmap for granting permanent commission (PC) to women officers and will soon issue letters to those eligible to ask whether they want to opt for it.

Around 600 short-service commission (SSC) officers, who have completed 10 years of their 14-year tenure, out of the total 1,653 women officers in the Army stand to immediately benefit from the Supreme Court’s directive to end the prevailing gender bias in the force. Incidentally, there are around 41,000 male officers in the 13-lakh strong Army.

“The Supreme Court decision is a welcome decision. It is a very enabling judgement because it gives us a sense of clarity and purpose on how to move forward to gainfully employ women officers for better efficiency of the organisation,” said Army chief General M M Naravane on Thursday.

The Army does not discriminate against soldiers based on religion, caste, creed, or even gender, he said, adding the force had begun inducting women officers as early as 1993 and was now also recruiting women as jawans in the Corps of Military Police.

“We have been champions of gender equality. I assure everybody that women officers will be given equal opportunity to contribute to the nation as well as progress in their careers,” said Gen Naravane .

But after largely restricting PC to women officers in the legal and education branches till now, it will be a major operational challenge for the Army to grant it across the board in other “combat support arms and services”, as reported by TOI earlier.

Apart from the existing Judge Advocate General and Army Education Corps, the government had just last year opened PC for new women SSC officers in eight other arms/services (Signals, Engineers, Army Aviation , Air Defence , Electronics and Mechanical Engineers, Army Service Corps, Army Ordnance Corps and Intelligence). But the SC has now directed that even serving women officers will be considered for PC, with command appointments also being opened for them.

45,['21/02/2020'],FATF pressure a factor in reduction of cross-border terror: Army chief,"This story is from February 21, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) should not let Pakistan off the hook or it will ramp up its continuing support for cross-border terror into India, said Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Thursday, adding there were as many as 250 to 300 terrorists present in camps and launch pads in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.

“If Pakistan feels it has got away with it in the FATF, it will certainly ramp up cross-border terrorism. With the entire glare of FATF on it, Pakistan would tone down its activities and rhetoric. FATF is a factor (in the reduction of cross-border terror),” said Gen Naravane .

Though Pakistan is likely to continue in the “grey list” of the FATF, the global watchdog against money-laundering and terror financing, it will have to willy-nilly deliver on its commitments to the intergovernmental organisation if it does not want to be relegated to the “blacklist”. “Even China has realised that it cannot back its all-weather friend all the time,” said Gen Naravane.

The Indian Army , however, is taking no chances. The force is maintaining high operational readiness all along the 778-km long line of control (LoC), which continues to remain highly volatile with daily cross-border firing duels. If India recorded as many as 3,479 ceasefire violations and firings across the LoC and the 198-km international border in J&K in 2019, smashing all annual records since 2003, the number has already crossed 580 this year.

Though there is a discernible downturn in terrorist-initiated violence levels in Kashmir , with the Army maintaining relentless pressure on terror outfits, the LoC “remains very active”. Gen Naravane said, “Terrorists are trying to infiltrate on a daily basis, with Pakistan army often providing them covering fire. But we are well geared to tackle it, and are successfully thwarting infiltration attempts.”

“We are also getting regular inputs about BAT (border action team) operations and are able to foil them even before they are launched. Our troops are very well-trained and always in a high state of alertness to deter any misadventure,” he added.

With summer fast approaching, and snow in the mountain passes slowly melting, the Army is also recalibrating its counter-infiltration grid, which is likely to see additional troops being moved closer to the border. “There are 15-20 terror camps across the border, mostly in PoK, with each having 15 to 20 terrorists at any given time, though the numbers fluctuate. It looks like the snow will melt earlier than anticipated. It will lead to many more infiltration attempts. So, we are working out a summer strategy to ensure we are ready for all contingencies,” said the Army chief.

But civilians often get caught in the middle during ceasefire violations, with the two rival armies continue to shell each other and heavy-caliber weapons like artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles also regularly coming into play, as well as intensive counter-terrorist operations in the hinterland.

India, for instance, lost 15 soldiers and 18 civilians, with many more being injured, in the cross-border firing duels last year. “I have also told our troops to be people-friendly and cause the least inconvenience to the local population,” said Gen Naravane.

Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray. (PTI)

MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray will be in New Delhi on Friday to meet PM Narendra Modi and Congress president Sonia Gandhi even as Congress and NCP appear to have further piled up pressure on the Shiv Sena to reject the National Population Register, which the Sena is in favour of implementing.

A senior Congress minister told TOI that CAA, NRC and NPR may figure in the meeting between Thackeray and Sonia given the divide in the Maha Vikas Aghadi over the issues. Both Congress and NCP want the MVA to take the position adopted by non-BJP states, and state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat reiterated on Thursday that his party would urge Thackeray to reconsider the Sena’s stand that NPR updation, set to begin in the state from May 1, was in the national interest.

This will be Uddhav’s first meeting with Sonia after becoming CM. His son Aaditya had met her in Delhi to invite her for his swearing-in ceremony in November 2019, but she did not attend. Aaditya will accompany Uddhav to Delhi on Friday as minister for tourism and protocol.

Sena MP and parliamentary party leader Sanjay Raut tweeted that the meeting with the PM would be a “courtesy call,” though Uddhav and Modi had met at a police conference in Pune soon after the latter was sworn in as CM. Raut stated, “There is no need to dig further, Jai Maharashtra.” However, sources said issues such as streamlining of payment of Maharashtra’s GST share and topics such as CAA-NRC-NPR may also be discussed.

Soures said Thackeray may congratulate Modi for announcing formation of a trust to construct the Ram mandir in Ayodhya. Uddhav had been pushing for the temple as part of the NDA before BJP and Sena ended their alliance after the state poll results. Even after he became CM, Uddhav said he would visit Ayodhya on March 7.

The Sena president had last year gone to Varanasi when PM Modi had filed his nomination papers for the April-May Lok Sabha elections, and Uddhav was in Gandhinagar as well to accompany then BJP chief Amit Shah for filing of his papers.

In a recent interview to Sena mouthpiece Saamna, Uddhav had said, when asked if he would go to Delhi, “It is not mandatory to visit Delhi, but I do not hate Delhi. Whenever required, I will visit.”

Asked if he would meet PM Modi and Sonia Gandhi, he had said, “Why I should not meet them? Will meet Modi, Soniaji, (LK) Advani.”

A Sena leader said chief ministers have to maintain a good rapport with the Centre for funds to be released smoothly and on time and for coordination on various issues.

On the even of Uddhav’s visit, NCP spokesperson and state minister Nawab Malik again spoke out against the NPR and said the MVA must examine the response of non-BJP states before taking a final stand on the matter. “Besides Congress-ruled Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, several other non-BJP states too have opposed NPR,” Malik said.

BENGALURU: A teenage student-activist was arrested and booked for sedition after she repeatedly raised ‘Pakistan zindabad’ slogans in her speech at an anti-CAA-NRC protest held in central Bengaluru on Thursday evening.Hyderabad MP and chief of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, Asaduddin Owaisi , who was on the stage, immediately condemned the girl’s statement and said, “Murdabad to all those who raise such slogans.”Additional commissioner of police (West) Soumendu Mukherjee said women police officers are questioning Amulya Leona Noronha , 19, who lives in KR Puram as a paying guest. Her father lives in Shivapura of Koppa in Chikkamagaluru district.Incidentally, Amulya was part of a three-member team that heckled Postcard News co-founder Mahesh Vikram Hegde at Mangaluru Airport in January. She, Karnataka Congress spokesperson Kavita Reddy and another student had asked Hegde to “prove his Indian-ness by singing Vande Mataram”.Thursday’s incident took place around 6.30pm at Freedom Park in the presence of Owaisi, who had come to address the gathering under the banner of ‘Save Constitution’. The teen activist began her speech with ‘awaaz do’ calls thrice, with the crowds responding ‘hum ek hain’. She suddenly broke into ‘Pakistan zindabad’ shouts thrice, and the crowd replied with ‘murdabad’, catching the organizers unawares.Commotion reigned as the girl chanted the slogan a second time. Organisers on the stage sought to take the mike away from her. An undeterred Amulya asked the gathering to chant with her. Then, she said ‘Hindustan zindabad’ and attempted to explain something, but police whisked her away to the backstage and arrested her. She was soon taken out of the protest venue.Owaisi took the mike even as Amulya was being whisked away and said, “I condemn the statement. I’m not associated with her. I’m disappointed that the organisers allowed such statements to be made at an event meant for the unity of our nation.”BBMP corporator Imran Pasha said the activist was at the event without permission and such slogans were raised to mar the secular image of Owaisi and the spirit of the anti-CAA protest.In Video: On cam: Ruckus at Owaisi's rally in Bengaluru after 19-year-old chants pro-Pakistan slogans on stage",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74234053,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-368093,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/teen-activist-charged-with-sedition-for-saying-pakistan-zindabad/articleshow/74234051.cms
48,['21/02/2020'],Retd Allahabad HC judge booked for 'beating cop at CAA meet' says was never there,"This story is from February 21, 2020

PILIBHIT: A retired judge of the Allahabad high court was among 33 people booked for allegedly ""assaulting and illegally confining"" a police constable during discussions on CAA and NRC held on private premises in Pilibhit on February 13. Mushaffey Ahmad , who served as a judge in the HC between 2012 and 2013, told TOI that he had not attended the gathering but had counselled some members of the group when they met him the same day to seek advice on how to express their views on CAA and NRC without violating laws.

Police booked the 33 identified individuals and 100 unidentified people under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by public servant), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to public servant), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 342 (wrongful confinement), 506 (criminal intimidation) and section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act.

Ahmad said on Thursday that he was “shocked to see my name in the FIR. I wasn’t even present in the meeting. I had met the group and told them that this gathering would be in violation of section 144 of the CrPC that is in force in the district, but that peaceful expression of their views was well within their constitutional rights”.

The 68-year-old also said that he found it “hard to believe” that a constable was assaulted at the meeting and confined overnight. He added, “Suppressing peaceful protests against CAA and NRC is unfortunate for the democratic values of the country as well as the dignity of the Indian constitution.”

He has now approached the chief justice of Allahabad HC and sought a high-level probe into the matter. “Policemen should be booked for falsely implicating me in an FIR. I will also meet the home secretary in this regard.”

Asked if police knew that Ahmad was a retired judge, officiating SHO, Pilibhit Kotwali police station, Mukesh Chand , said, “This can only be answered by the SHO who lodged the FIR. The SHO, Srikant Dwivedi, is on a week-long leave.”

Police stuck to their version that constable Dushyant Kumar was assaulted. A police officer said, “The protesters caught him and thrashed him. They even dragged him to an adjoining house and locked him up before threatening to kill him if he raised an alarm. However, he managed to escape on Friday and reached the police station where he narrated his ordeal.”

Congress district president Harpreet Singh Chaba, Bhim Army district president Atul Valmiki, district in-charge of Rashtriya Kisan Majdoor Sangathan Yusuf Malik and five women were among the 33 people booked for the incident.

Meanwhile, a joint delegation of Swaraj Abhiyan, UP Coordination Committee against CAA, NRC and Samvidhan Rakshak Sabha visited the area on Thursday. Ajit Singh Yadav , a member of Swaraj Abhiyan’s national working committee, alleged that police had lodged a false FIR. “Mohammad Bi whose house Kumar was supposedly dragged into and confined has denied such an incident. She said that her house had CCTVs and the footage can easily reveal the truth.”

(ANI photo)

NEW DELHI: Lobbying and speculation are peaking in Congress ahead of vacancies in Rajya Sabha in the coming months starting in April, with some sitting MPs likely to miss out on renomination and several contenders, young turks as well as old guard, jostling to make a comeback to Parliament.

By broad in-house calculations, Congress can get 10 out of 11 berths it will vacate in April and one of two in June. A total of 56 MPs are retiring in the two months. Besides the seats it can win easily, Congress is looking at arrangements with ally Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Left in West Bengal and JD(S) in Karnataka to bag extra seats.

As insiders concede, a second successive poor performance in Lok Sabha elections has sent the number of Upper House aspirants soaring like never before. A surprise feature of the post-2019 scenario is that an unprecedented number of young Congress members are pushing for Rajya Sabha, more commonly the preserve of seniors.

The reason behind young leaders seeking the safe harbour of the Upper House is the 2019 defeat which has put them at the risk of being out of Parliament for a long stretch. At the same time veterans too are strongly staking a claim in the process of seat allocation.

Among those at the top of the list is Mallikarjun Kharge , leader of Congress in the last Lok Sabha, who lost in 2019. He is said to be pushing hard for a seat in his home state Karnataka. His entry will put at risk nomination of AICC office-bearer and research department chief Rajeev Gowda who completes his first term.

There is a possibility of Madhya Pradesh giving Congress two members in place of the retiring former CM Digvijaya Singh . While Singh is the frontrunner for one berth, Jyotiraditya Scindia is seen as a contender of a seat and is also in the running as the new state Congress chief. However, two other names are doing the rounds, of a former Lok Sabha member, known for her proximity to Rahul Gandhi and an AICC office-bearer.

Milind Deora is a probable both for the Rajya Sabha and Mumbai Congress presidency, sources said. Similarly, an AICC office-bearer is trying hard for either the Upper House or the party chief’s post in Maharashtra .

Sources said Congress is also on the cusp of a reshuffle in state units as well as in new appointments in the AICC, and these openings may be used to accommodate aspirations of party members.

Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, where Congress can accommodate extra candidates, would be under serious pressure from aspirants. A young former MP, close to the Gandhi scion, is said to be eager to enter from Rajasthan.

AICC general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal did not contest his LS seat on the direction of the leadership. However, there is no vacancy coming up in Kerala and he may have his eyes on the next Kerala polls too. However, he is believed to be a contender too.

SURAT: At least 15 people suffered multiple injuries when two groups clashed in Bardoli on Thursday over names missing from a tile under a Shivaji idol that was inaugurated on Wednesday by top BJP leaders.

The groups armed with hockey sticks and blunt wooden objects chased each other at Dhamdod Naka in Bardoli.

The groups had a tiff on Tuesday night as well, but no actions was taken by police then.

One group was demanding names of their leaders to be inscribed on the tile under the Shivaji idol that was installed on Monday. While the other group had demanded names of their leaders on the tile. The argument had turned violent on Tuesday, but none of them had lodged an offence with police.

After inauguration of the idol on Wednesday, the argument between the two groups of the same community continued. But it turned violent when about two dozen people from each group attacked each other with sticks and hockeys. They also pelted stone on each other.

“The situation is under control. Process is on to register an offence,” said a police officer.

The NIMHANS team visited the SKMCH in Muzaffarpur on Tuesday and Wednesday

MUZAFFARPUR: A team of experts from National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience ( NIMHANS ) will visit primary health centres (PHCs) in five blocks prone to deadly acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in Muzaffarpur district .

Following an agreement with the state health department, the NIMHANS team headed by Dr V Ravi visited Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) here for two days – Tuesday and Wednesday – to assess measures to fight AES.

SKMCH superintendent Dr Sunik Kumar Shahi said the NIMHANS team inspected department of microbiology, pathology and paediatric intensive care Unit (PICU) at the hospital.

“They noted our technical capacity and assured full support for AES surveillance. The team will visit again after 15 days to inspect infrastructure at primary health centres (PHCs) of five AES-prone blocks – Musahari, Motipur, Meenapur, Kanti and Bochahan. The district administration has also initiated awareness programmes in far flung areas prone to outbreak of the disease in hot and humid weather,” Dr Shahi said.

Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Dr Shailendra Prasad Singh said the agreement between health department and NIMHANS to fight AES was crucial. “Preparations on technical aspects have already begun. Research on AES has been on since 2014, but clear findings are yet to come. We are hopeful that this study by NIMHANS will find the cause of the deadly AES disease,” he said.

PATNA: The social media pages of the Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) have become a big draw for students, who are going to appear for the board examinations due to begin on February 26. And no, this has nothing to do with last-minute preparations.

The last few days before the board exams are a stressful time for students, so the CBSE is using its social media presence on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to send out positive messages via memes to help students de-stress. The series of memes shared by the Board also give out tips as well as dos & don’ts.

Through amusing memes on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, the Board has taken a positive step to de-stress the students as well as shared the do’s and don’ts for candidates to be followed during the examination. The series of memes shared by the Board are all about tips and advice for students.

Sample this: “In exams its compulsory to write in pens ‘BLUE’, ballpoints of any kind or gel pens will do, now don’t say later ‘I didn’t have a CLUE’.”

Or this: “Pimples? Zero. Blackheads? Zero. Entry allowed after 10 am … ZERO.” Another one, accompanied with a photo of a kid in a lawyer’s gown, says, “Hard work pays. Melord, there’s evidence to prove this statement!”

From cautioning examinees to reach the exam hall on time to advising them to start preparations in advance, these memes with hashtags like #studysmart, #staycalm, #legallyspeaking, #examwarriors, #beontime and #preparewell among others are trending on social media.

Shailendra Mohan Jha, vice-principal of Gyan Niketan Boys ’ School, described the CBSE initiative as an innovative step to reduce anxiety and stress levels in kids. “The school administration even conducted a session for students to make them aware of the funny photos and videos shared by the Board,” Jha says.

There are also some short and informative videos for students, parents and teachers.

Aanand Kumar, a Class XII student of St Karen’s High School, said, he showed some of the videos to his parents. “There are some videos where the Board urged parents not to force kids to do well. Such videos and images lighten up our mood,” he adds with a smile.

“My parents showed me some funny pictures shared by the Board as I’m not using the social media since December-end,” says Kajal Sinha, a Class X student of St Dominic Savio’s High School.

However, Abha Choudhary, senior teacher at Notre Dame Academy , has a different suggestion. She believes nearly 90% students dissociate themselves from social media ahead of the exams to concentrate on studies. “It would be much better if the Board shared these messages earlier. However, there will be some impact if their parents are seeing these informative and amusing videos,” she says, adding, “The school administration from time-to-time sends message alerts to board students about technical changes such as use of only blue pens among others.”

Dr Satyajeet Singh, a city-based psychiatrist, says, “Laughter is the best medicine to relieve stress. I also advise kids to devote some time to laughter therapy, after long hours of study. It helps in reducing stress levels and increases immunity. During exam time, we get a lot of students who are stressed about appearing for board exams.”

Fed up: Farmers, ZP members and public stage a protest in front of the Mescom office in Kadaba on Thursday

Mangaluru: Farmers , zilla panchayat members, the public and others staged a protest in front of the Mescom office in Kadaba over frequent power cuts in the taluk on Thursday.

The protest was led by Meera Saheb of the JD(S). The protesters expressed their anger by blocking the national highway for some time. They later took out a procession to the Mescom office.

Meera Saheb, while addressing the protesters, alleged that the taluk was facing power cuts from the past two years, but nothing has been done to sort out the issue. In a week the taluk witnesses three days of power cuts without notice, and three days with prior notice. The power available on other days is insufficient to run pumpsets as power is supplied at a low voltage. Further, power cuts affect work at government offices, where people have to wait for several days to avail certain documents. The small and medium industries are left in the lurch as there is no production due to power outages. “There is a proposal for a substation at Alankar and Madavu, but it has not seen the light of the day due to lackadaisical behaviour of incumbent elected representative and Mescom officials. Earlier there was a court stay for the substation, but it has been cleared now. However, there is no progress,” Saheb said.

Mescom officials who came to the spot assured that the Madavu substation will be functional by the end of March. The Alankar substation will take time to take off as some landowners have filed an objection through the court.

MUMBAI: Axis Bank and Max Life Insurance said they will pursue a long-term strategic relationship, but stopped short of confirming an equity investment by the private lender in the insurer. A stake sale to Axis Bank by Max Life has been on the cards for several years. However, the RBI has been wary of lenders committing large capital to businesses that come outside its regulatory ambit.

On Thursday, ET reported Axis Bank was picking a 20% stake in Max Life. The statement on pursuing a strategic partnership was issued by Axis Bank in response to a stock exchange query with respect to the report.

“The ongoing discussions are a step further to deepen and strengthen this strategic partnership. The successful completion of the proposed transaction is expected to create significant value for all stakeholders,” said Axis Bank managing director and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry. He did not elaborate on what the transaction was.

A joint statement said the two had a successful bancassurance arrangement for nearly a decade with Rs 12,000 crore of premium being generated through the tie-up. It added that Axis Bank, Max Financial Services and its subsidiary Max Life have signed a confidentiality and exclusivity arrangement to explore a long-term strategic partnership.

Max Life is currently the largest non-bank-owned private life insurer in India. Max Financial Services holds a 72.5% stake in Max Life, while Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance and Axis Bank hold 25.5% and 2% stake respectively.

According to Max Group founder and chairman Analjit Singh, a strategic interest of Axis Bank in Max Life will lead to “the much-awaited permanence”.

CHENNAI: Deputy chief minister and state finance minister O Panneerselvam on Thursday expressed hope that the revenue in the coming fiscal would be better than that of this year.

He said in the assembly that though DMK MLA PTR Palanivel Thiagarajan had pointed out that having revenue deficit would prevent the government from spending on asset creation, the government schemes like giving free goats to the poor would improve rural economy.

The state was facing revenue deficit because of lower tax devolution from the Centre. If public debt was increasing, so was GSDP, he said. Debt as a percentage of GSDP was well within the 25% mark prescribed under FRBM, said Panneerselvam.

He agreed to DMK’s suggestion to set up a committee to study state’s own tax revenue.

61,['21/02/2020'],ICRA cuts outlook on Indian pharma,"This story is from February 21, 2020

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: ICRA has revised its outlook on the domestic pharmaceutical industry from stable to negative in view of the lockouts in parts of China, amid the coronavirus outbreak . Of the total imports of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and intermediates into India, China accounts for 65-70%, while in specific APIs like cephalosporins, azithromycin and penicillin, the dependence is as high as 80-90%.

The viral outbreak and the consequent lockout in China has resulted in a shutdown of production units in the country. The situation is more alarming in case of intermediates of stages prior to APIs and key starting materials (KSMs), which are the building blocks for drugs, where in some cases, China is the exclusive supplier. For instance, PenG and 7ACA, the key raw materials required for manufacturing cephalosporins are made in China only.

For some input materials, even if alternate sources are available, China remains the preferred source given the economical rates. Though a majority of the pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in China are located far from the coronavirus-affected sites, there has been a disruption in the supply chain.

According to ICRA, domestic formulations manufacturers have an inventory of 1.5-2.5 months on an average, and thus they have not been impacted as yet. However, a shortage of APIs and KSMs due to the extended lockout in China will adversely impact production of the formulations manufacturers. Coupled with an increase in API prices due to supply shortage, this will impact the profitability of the domestic formulations manufacturers.

The extent of impact of production shutdowns and increase in prices of raw materials on the profitability of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturers would, however, vary depending on each company’s product and raw material sourcing mix and the quantum of inventory held, a note said.

Varanasi: Madhuban police, arrested the manager of Harivansh Memorial Inter College (HMIC) Pravindra Mall in Mau district for giving copying tips to students and advising them to leave currency notes in answer sheets during board exams. He was presented before the court on Thursday.

A video of the manager giving such tips during annual function of the college went viral on social media. After the video came into his knowledge, district magistrate Mau Gyan Prakash Tripathi ordered the district inspector of school to probe into the matter. The manager was arrested after a student uploaded the video on the CM’s complaint portal following which the CM’s office issued directives to expedite the probe.

Inspector Madhuban Sanjiv Dubey said an FIR was lodged against Mall under section 4/10 of UP Public Examinations (prevention of unfair means) 1998 and 66D of IT Act on a compalint filed by principal of the college on Thursday.

With the commencement of UP Board exams on February 18, a video of Mall advising the students about tricks of copying and to escape the wrath of invigilators went viral on social media. In the video he could be found saying, “Ask fellow students the answers because that is not copying. Stay quiet when you are caught as the invigilator might let you off but if you argue, they will spoil your life.” In the video, he also assures cent per cent result. He also advised the students to leave currency notes in answer sheets to get passing marks.

DM said that after the video came into his knowledge he asked the DIOS to probe into the matter and initiate necessary action. The probe revealed that Mall gave such tips during annual function of the college last month. The matter was forwarded to the police for necessary action, said the DM.

63,['21/02/2020'],Faceless assessment alone cannot determine tax: HC,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Chennai: The e-proceedings facility introduced by the income tax (I-T) department from 2017-18 can lead to erroneous assessments as officials conclude these without “personal hearing” of the assessees, the Madras high court has said.

Though it is a laudable step towards e-governance, officers may not be able to understand transactions and statements of accounts of assessees, said Justice C Saravanan, quashing an assessment order passed by the deputy commissioner of income tax, Circle 1(1), Salem in Tamil Nadu. Further, the HC sent it back to the same I-T officer for a fresh order in two months.

“The government of India has introduced e-governance for conduct of assessment proceedings electronically. It is a laudable step taken by the income tax department to pave way for an objective assessment without human interaction. At the same time, such proceedings can lead to erroneous assessment if officers are not able to understand the transactions and statement of accounts of an assessee without a personal hearing. The officer should have at least called for an explanation in writing before proceeding to conclude that the amount collected by the petitioner was unusual.”

The Salem-based Salem Sree Ramavilas Chit Company had moved the court for quashing a December 27, 2019 order passed by the deputy commissioner. The I-T official had held that the company had not properly explained cash deposits of Rs 67.4 lakh collected during the demonetisation period in 2016.

Challenging the order, the company said the demonetisation order came on November 8, 2016, whereas the company had collected Rs 57.9 lakh during the first week of that month. It is the usual chit fund collection made during the period, it said, adding that the amount was properly accounted for. Standing by its assessment, the I-T counsel said the well-reasoned order did not require judicial interference, and added that from the 2017-18 assessment year onwards, assessments were done only through e-proceedings. The new method negated visit of the assessee to the department and made scrutiny easy.

Under the circumstances, Justice Saravanan said, “In my view, the petitioner (company) has prima facie demonstrated that the assessment proceeding has resulted in distorted conclusion on facts that amount collected by it during the period was huge and remained unexplained. It is liable to be treated as unaccounted money under Section 69A of Income Tax Act, 1961…Since the assessment proceedings no longer involve human interaction and is based on records alone, the assessment proceeding should have commenced much earlier so that before passing assessment order, the respondent assessing officer could have come to a definite conclusion on facts after fully understanding the nature of business of the petitioner.”

The judge then set aside the impugned order, and remitted the case back to the deputy commissioner to pass a fresh order within a period of 60 days. The petitioner shall file additional representation, if any, by treating the impugned order as a show-cause notice, within 30 days.

Surat: At a time when agitation by cooperative leaders and farmers against toll tax payment is gaining momentum, Bhatia toll plaza authorities on Thursday opened an extra lane for cash payment for vehicles.

Navsari MP CR Paatil and Majura constituency MLA Harsh Sanghavi had given an ultimatum to district administration on Wednesday to provide extra cash lane for vehicles registered in the city and district or else they would join the agitation against Bhatia toll plaza authorities.

Paatil told TOI, “We had met district collector on Wednesday and strongly represented Bhatia toll plaza issue. We had demanded an extra cash lane for allowing vehicles registered in the city and district to pass smoothly. Vehicles had to wait in long queues as there was a single cash lane at toll plaza.”

However, farmers and cooperative leaders, who have formed Bhatia Toll Naka Sangarsh Samiti, repeated their demand for total exemption in toll tax payment for local vehicles.

Darshan Naik, member of sangarsh samiti, told TOI, “Our agitation is for exemption from toll payment for vehicles registered in city and district. The agitation will continue till our demands are met.”

Mohan Bhatia, cooperative leader, told TOI, “Local vehicles are exempted from paying toll tax at Kamrej toll plaza located on National Highway (NH) after an agitation by us. Additional cash lane at Bhatia toll plaza was not our demand. We will continue our agitation till local vehicles are given free entry and exit at Bhatia toll plaza.”

<p>Devotees are set to celebrate Mahashivaratri with devotion on Friday (File photo)<br></p>

PATNA: Members of different puja committees will take out ‘shobha yatras’ across the city on the occasion of Mahashivaratri on Friday.

According to Jaleshwar Mahadev Mandir Samiti secretary Ajay Yadav, a procession will leave the temple in Kankarbagh after worshipping Lord Shiva and return after covering different parts of the city.

Another committee, Mahotsav Samiti, will take out a procession from the Shiva temple in Danapur. Samiti chairman Lakshmi Narayan Shah said the procession would culminate at Gauri Shankar Temple at Gaighat.

Meanwhile, all Shiva temples in the city, which attract large number of devotees on Mahashivaratri, have been decorated with flowers and colourful lights. Many of them will also organize nightlong ‘jagrans’ where people will sing hymns and songs dedicated to Lord Shiva.

City-based priest, Manohar Upadhyay, told this newspaper on Thursday that Mahashivaratri was one of the most important festivals among Hindu women.

“Goddess Parvati, the wife of Lord Shiva, is believed to be the epitome of love, beauty, marriage, fertility and children. Devotees, therefore, worship Lord Shiva on Mahashivaratri. Many observe ‘nirjala upwas’ and break the fast the next morning after consuming ‘prasad’. Some also eat ‘singhare ki puri’, ‘halwa’, ‘sabudana kheer’, ‘makhana’, dry fruits, fruits and milk on the occasion,” Upadhyay said and added, “Milk, honey, curd, ghee and ‘bel’ leaves are offered to the Lord amid chanting of mantras like ‘Om Namah Shivay’.

Devotees set to celebrate festival: Devotees are set to celebrate Mahashivaratri with devotion on Friday. A number of them will take a dip in the Ganga and visit Lord Shiva temples in the city.

Sabzibagh resident, Rishabh Ranjan, who is an ardent follower of Lord Shiva, said, “I believe Lord Shiva has helped me achieve everything. I have a good job and my own house. I, therefore, make sure that I worship the Lord with utmost devotion on Mahashivaratri. I also have a ‘shivalinga’ at my house.”

Kankarbagh resident Renu Gupta will offer flowers and milk to the Lord at five different temples. “I have already bought fruits, flowers and other ‘puja’ items for performing the rituals,” she said.

Massive crowds were witnessed at makeshift shops selling ‘puja’ items like ‘bel’ leaves and ‘bhaang’ on the eve of Mahashivaratri.

66,['21/02/2020'],Bihar assembly elections: Parties to roll out red carpet for women voters,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: Since women voters have outnumbered their male counterparts in terms of voting percentage in past one decade in the state, political parties are trying their best to strengthen their women cells and attract women voters in the upcoming assembly elections in the state.

In 2010 assembly elections, 54% women and 51% male voters had exercised their franchise. The figure in 2015 assembly elections went up to 59% for women voters and 53.9% for male voters.

With an eye on women voters, the ruling JD(U) has decided to deploy three to four active female workers at each booth. The party has coined the term ‘booth sakhi’ for these workers who will interact with local women and inform them about the work done by CM Nitish Kumar for the welfare of women.

Party’s women cell state president Sweta Vishwash said, “Nitish has worked a lot for women. Prohibition, reservation in government job and panchayati raj system, incentives to female child and scholarship to girl students are some of the examples. One can see transformation in the field of women empowerment.”

Sweta said the ‘booth sakhis’ would inform women voters about girls of their area who received Rs 25,000 scholarship after completing graduation. “We have also planned to hold an all-woman road show in all districts highlighting women empowerment in the state,” Sweta added.

The RJD has also planned to involve more women in its door-to-door campaign. RJD women cell state president Abha Lata said the party would focus on strengthening women base at panchayat level.

“Tall promises made by the CM are actually lying on papers. Our women groups will listen to the grievances of women and provide them all necessary help. Liquor ban has actually come as harassment for women from poor families. Their husbands are being sent to jail and they are running from pillar to post to get them released. Many women are not getting their due pension amount in the state,” Abha said.

The BJP is also trying to involve at least four active women workers at each booth. “We have decided to give one-third representation to women in our block and district level committees,” BJP state spokesperson Nikhil Anand said, adding the party will also rope in local women representatives before the election.

The Congress, on the other hand, has decided to make ‘mahila pracharaks’ at panchayat level. “We will make new women cell members at district, block and panchayat level by mid-March. These members will interact with local women and tell them about Congress’s agenda,” BPCC women cell president Amita Bhushan said.

PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar’s dream of seeing at least one Bihari dish on the plates of every Indian came true as PM Narendra Modi took ‘litti-chokha’ national when he tasted the dish at Hunar Haat in New Delhi on Wednesday.PM’s sampling of the Bihari delicacy grabbed headlines and generated political heat in Patna evoking sharp reactions from opposition politicians and lauded by ruling NDA leaders.Deputy CM and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi took to Twitter on Thursday to praise the PM. “It was a coincidence that when PM Narendra Modi was having litti-chokha in New Delhi’s Hunar Haat, the state government officials were busy in deliberations to make the dream to have a Bihari dish in every citizen’s platter a reality and devising ways to increase the income of farmers in the state.”SuMo’s tweet was in reference to Nitish’s statement in December 2010 in which he had said, “I dream of a day when every people in this nation will have at least one food item in their dish or kitchen from Bihar.”But former CM and HAM (S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi said, “Is this an announcement of the state assembly poll in Bihar due later this year?... Under such circumstances, it (PM tasting the dish) has its political interference.” he said, adding, he is also fond of litti-chokha.Leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, too, took to twitter. “Thank you respected PM for liking famous Bihari delicacy!” He added: “Since Bihar CM can’t talk, I would like to draw your attention towards Bihar’s legitimate share pending quite long.” However, his elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav tweeted in chaste Bhojpuri, “Katano khaee ba litti chokha, Bihari na bhuli dhokha.”The politics of ‘litti-chokha’ can’t be complete without a mention of former CM and RJD chief Lalu Prasad. Lalu, who is at present serving sentence in fodder scam cases, is among the admirers of this Bihari delicacy. “Lalu had said a day after Nitish parted ways from Mahagathbandhan in 2017 that two things have become famous in the country— Bihar Ka litti-chokha aur Nitish Ka ‘dhokha’ (betrayal),” a senior RJD functionary Mohammad Shami Ahmad said.“He (Lalu) played a good host during winters and enjoyed ghee-laced litti-chokha. He was of the opinion that ‘isme milawat ki jungayish hi nahi hai’, the RJD leader, once considered close to Lalu family, said.Litti-chokha has been a favourite dish not only for politicians but also for Bollywood stars. Actor Amir Khan had litti-chokha at a roadside stall near Patna zoo during the promotion of his movie ‘Ghajini’. Ajay Devgn and Sonakshi Sinha had also tasted it during promotion of their film ‘Son of Sardar’.“One of the major reasons behind the popularity of litti-chokha is its price.

SURAT: State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) department has unearthed Rs 22 crore of unaccounted transactions in simultaneous search operations carried out on 37 locations of 20 service providers engaged in mandap decoration, catering and renting out of party plot business in Surat and Ahmedabad on February 18.

Official sources said on Thursday that of the 20 service providers, 12 are from Surat.

SGST officials seized several incriminating documents from the premises of mandap decorators, party plot owners and caterers in Surat and Ahmedabad. Detailed scrutiny of the documents revealed that the service providers were doing business in cash without issuing bills to their customers.

The amount received in cash was not shown in book of accounts and thereby service providers indulged in massive tax evasion. In some cases, it was found that the service providers accepted part payment from their customers in cheque and the rest in cash.

69,['21/02/2020'],"DHFL sees Rs 934 crore Q3 profit, but auditors have concerns","This story is from February 21, 2020

(File photo)

MUMBAI: Troubled housing finance company DHFL reported a net profit of Rs 934 crore for the quarter ended December 2019 — almost thrice the Rs 313 crore reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The company had reported a loss of Rs 6,705 crore in the preceding quarter ended September 2019.

The audited financial results contain a host of qualifications from the auditors. These include uncertainty over adequacy of securities and value of these loans. The profits were reported despite all lending business of the company coming to a standstill. It is undergoing insolvency proceedings and lenders have invited bids for the company or parts of its business.

Several factors enabled the company to report an increase in net profit. First, it spent only Rs 1,423 crore towards finance costs even as it booked Rs 2,431 crore of interest income. This was partly because it did not provide for an interest amount of Rs 527 crore on borrowings since the insolvency commencement date — that is, December 3 — based on the opinion from legal advisers.

“If the interest was accrued on borrowings, the profit for the quarter and nine months would have been lower by Rs 392.39 crore,” said the cash-strapped company. Also, the only significant provisions made by the company was of Rs 1,139 crore toward the fair value of loans. According to the company, the valuation may change again under the insolvency process and the “recoverability or otherwise of these loans is yet to be ascertained”.

The Enforcement Directorate, which is investigating the company, had said that around 1 lakh retail accounts were fake, and funds were diverted. DHFL chairman and managing director Kapil Wadhawan is jailed in connection with a money-laundering probe against the late gangster and drug smuggler Iqbal Mirchi.

DHFL is currently being managed by an RBI-appointed administrator who has commissioned an independent firm to audit the transactions of the firm. The company said that until the outcome of the enforcement investigations and the administrator-commissioned audit are not known, it is not possible to know the impact on the financial results.

M V Magnate, carrying a cargo of steel, has come from Shanghai

CHENNAI: Drama preceded the docking of M V Magnate from Shanghat at Chennai port on Tuesday as two of its crew showed symptoms of fever and were quarantined onboard. They later tested negative for novel corona virus (COVID-19). The bulk carrier with a cargo of steel had to wait for a day in the outer anchorage after staff of pilot boats refused to guide it in.

Ships cannot enter a port unless staff of pilot boats board it and guide the captain to steer it through water channels that lead to the dock. Giant bulk carriers need at least four pilot boats and a tug to guide them.

When M V Magnate, bearing a Panama flag, reached the city port’s outer anchorage, the captain requested permission to be guided into the port, but staff who man pilot boats refused to do it because of a scare that the Chinese crew could be infected with COVID-19 as it had come from Shanghai. Later, workers by the side of the quay also refused to handle the ship if it was brought in, saying they were frightened to touch the ropes that would be thrown out from the ship to moor it. There is no ban on ships from China entering ports in India.

On Wednesday, sources in the port said, the authorities had to send a team led by a health officer on a boat to the ship. “The team checked the crew and found that two of them had symptoms of fever. Then another team reached the ship and collected blood samples of the unwell sailors to be sent to the lab for testing,” he added.

The authorities, meanwhile, convinced the staff and workers to handle the ship as the affected crew had been quarantined onboard. It was brought in after they were informed that the affected sailors had only mild fever and no symptoms of respiratory problem.

Another official said that the ship had to wait for a day at the outer anchorage and the cargo was not unloaded till the results showed that the two crew members had tested negative for COVID-19. “They have docked the ship and the unloading began on Thursday evening. The ship is scheduled to leave the port on Saturday. Now that it has lost a day, the departure may get delayed,” he added.

The protocol put in place at ports includes thermal screening of the crew and passengers and a quarantine facility where people with symptoms of fever can be moved. But all these are to be followed only after ships reach the docks.

Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Thursday asked the industry department to explore ways for industrial use of poplar variety of trees available in the state by involving the paper industry, as it would help in increasing the income of farmers.

The CM was making the mid-term review of the achievements made under the Bihar Industrial Incentive Policy (BIIP)-2016, besides discussing the amended provisions of the industrial policy. The review meeting was held at the Sankalp auditorium on the premises of the CM’s official residence – 1, Anne Marg.

The CM also asked the industries department to send a team of experts to Uttarakhand to study the functioning of poplar processing plants. The poplar variety of trees, which have grown up in the last eight years, could be used in the paper industry to bring increased returns to farmers, he said.

Nitish said at a time when trade, business and commercial activities have increased in the state, there is a need to explore the areas in which investors could pump in money to establish industries.

The industries department made a detailed presentation at the review meeting which was attended by industries minister Shyam Rajak, chief secretary Deepak Kumar, development commissioner Arun Kumar Singh , finance and energy department principal secretaries S Siddharth and Pratyaya Amrit, respectively, as well as principal secretary to CM Chanchal Kumar, industries department secretary Narmadeshwar Lal and agriculture secretary N Sarwan Kumar, among others.

The CM said the government launched the ‘Hariyali Mission’ in 2012 under which 19 crore saplings of various varieties were planted. He said the poplar variety of trees had grown and matured, and, therefore, were ready for use in the paper industry.

PATNA: After their meeting in Patna with LJD chief Sharad Yadav last week, leaders of the three smaller Mahagathbandhan constituents — RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha, HAM (S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi and VIP chief Mukesh Sahni — met expelled JD (U) functionary Prashant Kishor in New Delhi on Thursday.

Prior to this meeting, Kishor had met Kushwaha alone on Wednesday. As with the Sharad Yadav meeting, RJD and Congress were not represented in the Thursday’s meeting with the three opposition leaders.

RLSP general secretary Madhaw Anand told TOI on Thursday that discussions on a wide range of issues were held in the meeting between Kushwaha and Kishor on Wednesday. “Kishor has been in touch with us and preliminary rounds of discussions are being held as of now. No commitment has been made on poll-rated association from any side as of now,” Madhaw said.

Kishor did not respond to queries made by TOI on his meetings with the Mahagathbandhan leaders.

Political observers speculated that the bid to make a separate approach to Kishor by Kushwaha, Manjhi and Sahni could be an attempt to flex muscle in front of allies Congress and RJD or create a third front in Bihar.

“It is unlikely that Kushwaha and Majhi will accept leadership of RJD chief Lalu Prasad ’s younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav in the upcoming assembly elections. So they are trying to flex muscle by holding separate meetings with Sharad Yadav and Kishor,” said D M Diwakar, social scientist and professor of economics at Patna- based A.N. Sinha Institute of Social Studies.

“For me, it is a tactics for eying larger share of seats in the upcoming elections,” Diwakar added.

RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari said all parties are free to pursue their own strategies, while Bihar Congress functionaries were non-committal on their party’s stand on Kishor.

Kishor, however, had claimed on Tuesday that he is not working for any political party or leader in the run up to Bihar elections as of now.

Most opposition parties in Bihar hailed the manner in which Kishor attacked the governance model of CM Nitish Kumar in his presser in Patna on Tuesday, claiming that Bihar of 2005 and that of today are the same.

“PK has expressed the opinion of all people of Bihar, especially the youths. Bihar does not want to look back, rather it aspires to progress in the future…PK’s strategy will act as a catalyst to bring change in Bihar,” Kushwaha had tweeted hours after PK’s presser on Tuesday.

Manjhi, too, had hailed Kishor and said he would be welcomed in Mahagathbandhan for development of Bihar. “Kishor has Bihari DNA… Kishor stands with Gandhian ideologies and it is everyone’s responsibility to stand with him and work on the suggestions given by him for development of Bihar,” Manjhi had said on Tuesday.

Terming the state Budget as “routine,” opposition BJP on Thursday said the Budget was a very poor example of financial management which had no vision to safeguard the rights and interests of farmers, labourers and women.

Leader of Opposition in the assembly, Gulab Chand Kataria, said the Ashok Gehlot government had already burdened consumers with Rs 12,000 crore annually by increasing the power tariff. “Power companies are reeling under losses. There has been no provision or plan to bring power companies in profit and the government has given an annual burden of Rs 12,000 crore on consumers by increasing power tariff,” Kataria said at a press conference after the Budget.

Deputy leader of opposition, Rajendra Rathore, said Gehlot had merely done some jugglery of words. “He has misled people as the Budget lacks any vision or farsightness,” he added.

State BJP president Satish Poonia termed it a “routine Budget” which is not going to fulfil the expectations of the people. “Every time they blame the Centre government but never admitted that this government so far has a very poor financial management. I believe this is totally a directionless Budget which has failed to fulfil the exactions of various sections of society,” he added.

Surat: At least 15 people suffered multiple injuries when two groups came to blows in Bardoli on Thursday on the issue of missing names from the plaque placed under the idol of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj inaugurated a day earlier by BJP leaders. The groups chased and hit each other with hockey sticks and blunt wooden objects on a public road at Dhamdod Naka in Bardoli.

The groups fought with each other on Tuesday night as well but no action was taken by police then. Both groups want names of their leaders to be inscribed on the plaque. The arguments turned violent on Tuesday but no offence was lodged .

After the idol was inaugurated on Wednesday, the argument over names continued and it turned violent when around 25 people from each group reached the spot. They attacked each other with sticks and hockey sticks. They pelted each other with stones as well.

""Police reached the spot and controlled the situation. We have started the process to register the offence and to identify those involved in the clash,"" a police officer said.

75,['21/02/2020'],"At Rs 42,900, gold touches an all-time high","This story is from February 21, 2020

Chennai: Gold prices touched an all-time high of $1,612 an ounce on Thursday, as investors parked themselves in safe havens even as they weigh the impact of coronavirus outbreak in China on the global economy. 24 carat domestic gold prices touched a high of Rs 43,050 for 10 grams in Chennai. Prices in Mumbai and Delhi hovered around Rs 42,900. A weak rupee at Rs 71.7/ USD further pushed up prices.

The price rise comes at a time when gold imports are down by 9% and the budget upheld the import duty of 12.5%, holding up the prices and doing away with changes of a pick-up in domestic demand. The World Gold Council saw a 9% drop in the overall gold demand in India in 2019. The gold prices are up by 6% in 2020.

Analysts predict a further rally in prices. “Following concerns still persisting over the spread of Coronavirus, the primary trend of Gold continues to remain bullish.

The near and medium-term oscillators are positive. This has potential to rise towards Rs 41,850 - Rs 42,000 and over the next couple of months on the MCX,” says Arun Kumar, market strategist, Reliance Securities.

Kishore Narne from Motilal Oswal adds that countries such as China, Germany, Japan and Britain looking to increase liquidity, even if the impact of Coronavirus reduces, the prices would go up as this would favour purchase of gold by investors. “In the short term, the price would go upto $1,680 globally and Rs 43,500 in India,” he added.

AHMEDABAD: A 53-year-old head constable posted in the security branch of the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) in Gandhinagar, allegedly committed suicide by shooting himself with his service revolver on Thursday afternoon at a vacant house in Sector-30 of the capital, ostensibly due to financial problems.

Sata Teja Rabari, a native of Ramdhani village of Shihor taluka in Bhavnagar district, had been in the service for around 25 years, said Gandhinagar deputy superintendent of police M K Rana. Rabari had been deployed in the security branch at the state secretariat in Gandhinagar for five years and lived in a flat at Pethapur village.

Rana said Rabari went to a vacant house in the government colony at Sector 30 in his car and shot himself. As a police control room (PCR) vehicle passed by, two cops in the van saw the vehicle in front of the vacant house. Suspecting illegal activity, they went inside and found Rabari in a pool of blood.

Rana further said that a suicide note was found in Rabari’s pocket, in which he described the financial problems he was facing for six months.

“Rabari had also called his wife at around 11.45am and told her that this would be his last call and asked her to take care of their four children. In the note, he also asked his younger brother to take care of his children and fix his elder son’s engagement,” said Rana.

An official of Sector-21 police station, where a case of accidental death was registered, said that Rabari did not say in the note whether he was being harassed by a moneylender.

He just wrote that he was in a financial crisis and it was impossible for him to live any more.

DGP Gupteshwar Pandey

PATNA: With a view to sharing views with people’s representatives and students , director general of police (DGP) Gupteshwar Pandey will hold a ‘chaupal’ at the Akshaywat Stadium in Hajipur on February 22.

According to Vaishali SP Gaurav Mangla, preparations are afoot to make the ‘chaupal’ a grand success.

“The state police chief wants to have a direct conversation with people’s representatives and students. He will make them aware of their roles in making the society crime-free and maintaining peace and harmony,” the SP told this newspaper on Thursday.

The DGP’s ‘chaupal’ assumes significance in the wake of recent spurt in crimes like loot, murder and extortion in Vaishali.

Tirhut range IG Ganesh Kumar had reviewed the law and order situation in the district on Wednesday and told the SP and the DSP to pull up their socks. “Rising incidents of loot and murder are a headache for the district police. The situation has, however, improved as several cases were cracked in the past couple of weeks,” the IG said.

In January, a notorious liquor smuggler, Baiju Mahto, was killed in an encounter with police under the Lalganj police station area in the district. “His elimination and intensive raids on liquor smugglers have contained the supply of the commodity in the district,” sources in the SP office said.

Government teachers stage protest at the office of district education officer in Patna on Thursday

PATNA: More than 300 government schoolteachers ‘gheraoed’ the district education office on Thursday and asked Patna DEO Jyoti Kumar to revoke the termination of two regular teachers and the show-cause notices against four ‘niyojit’ (contractual) teachers. They even tried to take the staff hostage, but the latter locked the office gate and escaped.

The DEO had terminated the services of two regular teachers — Manoj Kumar of Middle School at Nooruddinganj in Malsalami and Mohd Mustafa Azad of Prathmik Vidyalaya in Chakram — on February 17. He also issued show-cause notices to Prem Chandra of Kanya Madhya Vidyalaya in Bankipore, Rameshwar of Rewa Middle School in Masaurhi, Anand Mishra of Raghopur Middle School in Bihta and Virendra Kumar Yadav of Maharajghat Middle School in Patna City on late Wednesday evening.

A ‘niyojit’ teacher of Harnatiya School in Bakhtiyarpur, Jitu Singh, told this newspaper, “The state government will have to fulfil our demand of equal pay for equal work. It won’t be able to fool us this time.”

Manoj, one of the teachers whose services have been terminated, said the protest at the DEO office would continue till their demands were met. “Staging protests is our democratic right and the government cannot threaten us by stopping our salaries or initiating other actions. Such lame attempts will only add fuel to the fire,” he added.

Around 4.5 lakh ‘niyojit’ and regular teachers of government and government-aided schools had gone on an indefinite strike on February 17, demanding equal pay for equal work and old pension scheme, among others.

“Around 70,000 teachers of secondary schools and members of the Bihar School Secondary Teachers’ Association will also join the protest from February 25. How will the government cope with the situation and who will they depute for evaluation of answer sheets?” asked Anand, who was issued a show-cause notice.

He also alleged that the education department had not invited the teachers for talks even though they had submitted a letter in this regard.

Education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma, on the contrary, claimed that the department was ready to talk to the teachers, but their demands could not be fulfilled.

“We will not let the students suffer and look for other ways to get the Intermediate and Matriculation answer sheets evaluated. The results will also be published on time,” he said.

Complaint lodged against teachers: A complaint has been lodged against 22 teachers in Darbhanga and four teachers in Saharsa for forcefully shutting their respective district education offices. One teacher has also been arrested in Begusarai for attacking the DEO.

80,['21/02/2020'],Bihar: Visit this college park to learn Gandhi philosophy,"This story is from February 21, 2020

PATNA: Naubatpur-based Malti Dhari College has developed a park for disseminating moral teaching based on Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals to students and others.

Named as Bapu Naitik Udyan, the park, created in a 60x60 feet lawn, displays several moral teachings on marble plates where students pass their leisure hours, take selfies and share them on social media.

A separate marble plate written with the seven sins listed by Mahatma Gandhi attracts large number of viewers, especially guardians who visit the campus for different works.

College principal Dr Kanhaiya Prasad Sinha said the park was developed as a token of tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary and now it has become an attraction for both students and guardians.

“A bust of Mahatma Gandhi will soon be installed on a podium in the middle of the park. Some private schools of the neighbouring areas too take this place as a site of excursion and send their children to note down the quotes loaded with ethical values,” Sinha said. Also, the college has developed a meditation spot, Dhyan Sthal, under a peepal tree planted by the chief minister Nitish Kumar in June 2008, Sinha added. A constituent unit of Pataliputra University, Malti Dhari College has about 5,000 students, including a large number of girls.

Shweta Bala, an English teacher and incharge of the cultural activities at the college, said the messages and Gandhi’s quotes displayed at the park had an appeal to students for introspection and many of them take selfies and share them on social media. She said the park cast a positive impact on students who remain mostly busy with their books and examinations and have little time to think over the ethical values.

81,['21/02/2020'],Shaktikanta Das at MPC: Economy needs more monetary stimulus,"This story is from February 21, 2020

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das (File photo: PTI)

MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das had said at the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting held earlier this month that the economy needed further monetary stimulus, but refrained from pushing for a rate cut given the uncertainty over inflation. This is revealed by the minutes of the meeting, which were released on Thursday. They further show that all members of the MPC were concerned about inflation.

“The Union Budget has sought to provide counter-cyclical support to the economy while broadly adhering to fiscal prudence. Monetary transmission and bank credit flows have improved, but they need to become stronger. While the macroeconomy needs further monetary stimulus, the inflation outlook continues to be uncertain,” Das had said. The MPC meeting resulted in a unanimous vote for holding rates. However, Das announced a three-year loan to banks at cheap rates to bring down their cost of funds.

The minutes show that the MPC members had expected that inflation would come down. This did not happen because the seasonal winter softening of vegetable prices was delayed and prices of several other food items such as pulses, milk and edible oils continued to rise.

“There is uncertainty about inflation excluding food and fuel, given the recent cost-push shocks, especially of mobile charges, prices of automobiles and essential medicines. Overall, the path of headline inflation is expected to moderate. But, given the prevailing uncertainty, it is prudent to await more clarity based on incoming data,” said Das.

Deputy governor Michael Patra said that the MPC has entered “the tunnel of testing trade-offs” and it may be a while before the light at the end of the tunnel is sighted. “As in December, a monetary policy response to the state of the economy is stifled by higher than expected elevation in inflation. The breach in the upper tolerance band of the MPC’s inflation target band in the December print may well recur in the months ahead,” said Patra.

Other members also strongly expressed the need to tackle inflation. “I find the growing chorus challenging the efficacy of flexible inflation targeting in India worrying. For those who advocate targeting an inflation rate higher than 4%, I am sorry: 4-6% inflation is not price stability!” said economics professor and MPC member Chetan Ghate.

According to Janak Raj, executive director in charge of the MPC, the increase in inflation in non-vegetable food items was more likely to be sustained. “Given this broad-based increase in food prices, there is a lot of uncertainty as to the level at which food inflation will stabilise even as onion prices normalise completely. Food inflation, therefore, needs careful monitoring,” he said.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Swiss gold is being smuggled into the city in large quantities through land, sea and air, said senior officials of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on Thursday.

While the land route from Myanmar is famous for gold smugglers, the sea route from Sri Lanka and multiple air routes are now being used by smugglers to hoodwink police and the DRI.

DRI statistics reveal that in 2019-20, around 25 cases were booked in which 162 kg of gold valued at Rs 60 crore was seized. This was much higher than the 40 kg of gold valued at Rs 13 crore seized in 2018-19.

Sources said overall gold smuggling has increased as the demand in the domestic market has risen. “Switzerland has one of the world's biggest refineries of gold. Gold mined from Africa and elsewhere in the world reaches Switzerland and gold bars are made. There is a huge demand for Swiss origin gold due to its purity. Most of the gold caught by us is of Swiss origin,” said a top DRI official.

DRI officials found the seal of Valcambi Swiss gold in the seized items and it is believed that traders buy them legally in Switzerland at low cost and smuggle it out through aerial routes.

Officially, India is one of the biggest importers of gold from Switzerland and after Switzerland, most gold seized is from UAE.

Investigations also revealed that using the sea route from Sri Lanka, the gold reaches Ramanathapuram in Tamil Nadu, before it's smuggled by road to Hyderabad.

It is smuggled from Myanmar via Guwahati to Hyderabad by land.

Last year, the DRI said that Myanmar-based gold refineries on the borders of Mizoram and Manipur are the transit points of gold smuggling.

In 2018-19, India imported around 982 tonnes of gold worth USD 32.9 billion and more than half of it was from Switzerland, according to import and export data of the Ministry of Commerce.

The service is scheduled to start from February 26

SURAT: Shrimp farming in south Gujarat is set to get a boost following SpiceJet’s decision to launch first ‘marine krishi udaan’. A direct dedicated freighter service to connect Chennai, Visakhapatnam , Surat and Kolkata has been announced by the airline from February 26.

Official sources said Chennai and Visakhapatnam are major shrimp seed producing centres in India. The shrimp seeds are then sent to West Bengal and Gujarat for farming and breeding. However, shrimp farmers face a lot of problems in transporting these seeds as there are no direct dedicated flights from the production centres to locations of cultivation.

SpiceJet officials stated that the direct dedicated freighter service will be launched from Chennai and Visakhapatnam to Surat and Kolkata from February 26. This will improve logistics and connectivity, thus helping enormously in the growth of shrimp farming.

Gujarat Aqua Feed Dealers’ Association (GAFDA) estimates requirement of 500 crore shrimp seeds per annum in Gujarat, mainly in south Gujarat. Majority of shrimp seeds are sourced from Chennai and Visakhapatnam via Mumbai. It takes about 10 hours for the seeds to reach hatcheries, leading to high mortality rate and losses to farmers.

GAFDA president Manoj Sharma said, “The dedicated freighter service to Surat will pave the way for further development of shrimp farming in south Gujarat. This is a good news for shrimp farming community. The demand for shrimp seeds is increasing and we presume that the airline will have to start additional freighter service to cater to the ever-growing demand.”

Sharma added, “The daily requirement of shrimp seeds in south Gujarat is pegged at one crore. Over 800 farmers cultivate shrimps on 7,000 hectare of land. This is going to be a win-win situation for the farmers.”

Airports Authority of India (AAI) inaugurated domestic cargo terminal at Surat airport on January 29. The cargo terminal built at a cost of Rs13 crore is designed to handle all types of cargo, including agriculture, floriculture, valuables, marine, hazardous etc.

SURAT: Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has unearthed GST tax evasion to the tune of Rs15.5 crore by manufacturers and suppliers of packaged snacks during simultaneous search operations carried out in Surat, Vadodara, Bharuch and Surendranagar on Thursday.

DGGI’s Surat zonal unit had received intelligence about various firms engaged in the manufacturing and selling of packaged snacks for huge evasion of GST. Search operations were carried out in Surat, Bharuch, Vadodara and Surendranagar by DGGI sleuths , an official release said.

Preliminary scrutiny of documents revealed that the firms were miss-classifying their products under harmonized system nomenclature (HSN) code to evade GST payment. The unfried fryum and papad products supplied by the firms are taxable at the rate of 12% under GST. However, these firms were not paying applicable tax thereby evading GST to the tune of Rs15.5 crore.

A DGGI officer said the firms have admitted about misclassification of the items and non-payment of GST. The firms have paid Rs90 lakh and have agreed to pay the remaining tax dues soon.

Brakishwater aquaculture farmers’ conclave participants during a field visit on Wednesday

SURAT: South Gujarat has become the largest shrimp producing region in western India and third in the country after Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal . From 300 metric tonne in 2009, shrimp production has crossed 45 ,000 metric tonne per annum in 2019, generating an annual turnover of Rs 2,000 crore.

Gujarat Aqua Feed Dealers’ Association (GAFDA) president Manoj Sharma said, “There is a huge potential to increase shrimp farming in Gujarat, particularly in south Gujarat. There is 3.75 lakh hectare of brakishwater land available in Gujarat, of which hardly 2% is under cultivation.”

Sharma added, “About 800 farmers are involved in shrimp farming on about 7,000 hectare of brackish water land in Surat, Bharuch, Navsari and Valsad. These farmers give direct employment to more than 25,000 people and indirect employment to approximately 30,000 people.”

In his presentation at national brakishwater aquaculture farmers’ conclave organized by Central Institute of Brakishwater Aquaculture (CIBA) in the city on Thursday, Sharma said domestic consumption of shrimps in India is negligible and that about 90% of the production is exported to the United States, China, Japan, West Asia, China and Vietnam .

Sharma said majority of farmers grow venami variety of shrimps. In one hectare of land, farmers can cultivate 5,000 kilogram of shrimps having international value of $30,000. Even if we consider 10% profit, farmers earn $3,000 in a single crop.

Pradip Navik, vice-president of Gujarat Aquaculture Association (GAA), told TOI, “Gujarat has capacity to produce over Rs10,000 crore worth of shrimps, but we are not getting government support when it comes to allotment of land. Majority of brakishwater land is owned by the government in the coastal areas of the state.”

Rahul Bhagwagar, a shrimp farmer from Olpad, who owns 300 ponds, said, “I started with two ponds 10 years ago and now own 250 of them. We have been cultivating 1,400 tonne of shrimps per annum.”

Nehal Gandhi, who owns 400 shrimp ponds in Borsi and Machad villages in Navsari district, said, “Atmosphere and water quality in south Gujarat are conducive for shrimp farming. We want some support from the government to take the blue revolution to a much higher scale. At present, we are cultivating 1,200 tonne per annum.”

PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar’s dream of seeing at least one Bihari dish on the plates of every Indian came true as PM Narendra Modi took ‘litti-chokha’ national when he tasted the dish at Hunar Haat in New Delhi on Wednesday.PM’s sampling of the Bihari delicacy grabbed headlines and generated political heat in Patna evoking sharp reactions from opposition politicians and lauded by ruling NDA leaders.Deputy CM and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi took to Twitter on Thursday to praise the PM. “It was a coincidence that when PM Narendra Modi was having litti-chokha in New Delhi’s Hunar Haat, the state government officials were busy in deliberations to make the dream to have a Bihari dish in every citizen’s platter a reality and devising ways to increase the income of farmers in the state.”SuMo’s tweet was in reference to Nitish’s statement in December 2010 in which he had said, “I dream of a day when every people in this nation will have at least one food item in their dish or kitchen from Bihar.”But former CM and HAM (S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi said, “Is this an announcement of the state assembly poll in Bihar due later this year?...

Lalu, who is at present serving sentence in fodder scam cases, is among the admirers of this Bihari delicacy. “Lalu had said a day after Nitish parted ways from Mahagathbandhan in 2017 that two things have become famous in the country— Bihar Ka litti-chokha aur Nitish Ka ‘dhokha’ (betrayal),” a senior RJD functionary Mohammad Shami Ahmad said.“He (Lalu) played a good host during winters and enjoyed ghee-laced litti-chokha.

C Ve Shanmugam

CHENNAI: Law minister C Ve Shanmugam on Thursday said Tamil Nadu was legally competent to enact the bill to protect the Cauvery delta region, since agriculture came under the state list.

The law minister told the assembly that the Union minister for environment, Prakash Javadekar , had informed chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami that the January 16 Central notification did not prevent the state government from taking an appropriate decision in the matter and that the final decision on allowing any particular project would continue to vest with the state government.

The CM had written to the Union minister on February 10, requesting him to add a provision to the amendment notification brought out by the ministry, exempting public hearing for hydrocarbon projects. He wanted the Centre’s backing to declare the Cauvery delta districts as an ecologically sensitive zone.

Javadekar in his February 19 letter, said, “Dear Sri Edappadi K Palaniswami ji, this has reference to your letter dated February 10, regarding concerns on the onshore and offshore of oil and natural exploration projects or activities, while appreciating your concern regarding ecologically fragile agricultural zone situated in the Cauvery delta districts. We would like to bring to your notice the fact that the current notification dated January 16 does not prevent the state government from taking appropriate decision in the matter.”

“Any project proponent will, in the present scheme of things, have to apply to state environment impact assessment authority (SEIAA), which is an organ of the state government and SEIAA will take a final call in the matter. Therefore, the final decision as to whether to allow any particular project in any particular region would continue to vest with the state government. Further, such projects are also required to obtain the consent under the Air and Water Act from the state pollution control board,” said Javadekar in his letter.

Of the 31 petroleum mining licences (PML) and petroleum exploration licences (PEL) granted by the Centre, covering 341 wells, only 16 licences were active. There were no protests by locals over these wells which came into existence since 1958. Of the two licences for hydrocarbons, the AIADMK rejected one in 2013 and had not given sanction for Neduvasal till date, Shanmugam said.

The minister said the Centre had delegated powers to the state under environment protection laws to decide on the polluting industries. The industries must get environmental sanction of the state government under water and air laws. “The state is empowered to ban or shut any polluting industry. You don’t need to fear,” the minister said, pointing to the closure notice issued to Sterlite’s copper smelter unit in Tuticorin and ban on single use plastic by the state government.

Be it the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data or gangster Papla Gujjar’s jailbreak, it wasn’t a great year as far as the state’s law and order was concerned. However, nothing much was given in the Budget provisions for 2020-21 for modernisation of the police force, especially facilitating police stations with technical resources and adequate manpower.

Though chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who also holds the finance portfolio, proposed for consolidating the Special Operations Group (SOG) by adding two new field units and a special anti-narcotics unit, nothing much has come to the kitty of the home department.

Though there was a proposal of Rs 70 crore for purchase of 1,682 new vehicles, nothing much has been done to upgrade the police stations. “The incident of notorious gangster Papla Gujjar has exposed the arrangements one can see at a police station. I think there is a desperate need to have CCTV cameras, proper manpower equipped with arms and more quick response teams,” Omendra Bharadwaj, former DG, Rajasthan Police told TOI. He said recruitment on a big scale is a must and some provisions should have been there to combat cyber crime, the new challenge for the police. “I have found nothing to make the police stronger to check cyber crime,” he added. Some other retired officers criticized the provision of emergency response support system (ERSS).

CHENNAI: The DMK , allies Congress and IUML walked out of the assembly in protest after their repeated pleas for referring the bill to a select committee to clarify several issues were not heeded to.

DMK chief M K Stalin said the party wholeheartedly welcomed the legislation, and that the party MPs would raise the issue of explorations in the Parliament, but said the bill should be referred to a committee for further clarification as the Supreme Court had struck down a law enacted by the Gujarat government as natural gas was a central subject. “Certain issues could be clarified if it is sent to the select committee. Only then full victory can be attained,” he said.

Stalin sought to know why the period of elected representatives in the proposed authority was confined to one year, and why delta districts like Trichy , Karur and Ariyalur were excluded from the bill’s purview. “The bill will be good only if the projects in operation are included,” he said, which was also reflected by deputy leader of opposition S Durai Murugan. Congress whip S Vijayadharini said the government should have provided information about existing projects in the bill for better clarity.

92,['21/02/2020'],Poor diet increases impacted wisdom teeth risk: Dental College survey,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Agra: “People who grow up eating processed, nutrient-poor diet are at the increased risk of impacted wisdom teeth,” says a survey conducted by Dr Z A Dental College (ZADC), Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). The survey covered people of various walks of life, including doctors, teachers, tailors, photographers, students, police personnel, house wives, farmers, shop keepers, engineers, businessmen, labourers and brokers.

Dr G S Hashmi of the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery, who conducted the survey on 5,030 patients, with his team, pointed out that heavy dependency on refined foods was found to be a common reason for the occurrence of third molars or wisdom teeth in most of the subjects who were surveyed.

Hashmi emphasised that the wisdom tooth may grow sideways, emerge only partially or remain completely trapped under gum and bone and is bound to make flossing more difficult, allowing food and bacteria to become trapped.

The doctor further said the survey gave solid evidence that “soft” modern diet, in conjunction with other factors associated with lifestyle, can promote abnormal development of jaws and narrow dental arches that don't fit in those third molars quite as well.

“Wisdom teeth are the last of the teeth to develop. They usually come in between the ages of 17 and 25. While you need the rest of the teeth in your mouth, you don't need an impacted tooth as it could damage the teeth around and cause gum disease and lead to infections and illnesses that can affect the heart, lungs and other organs,” said Hashmi.

He pointed out that it is a better idea to simply have wisdom teeth removed early on as in some cases, fluid-filled cyst or tumor can form around an untreated wisdom tooth.

""The survey showed that 43% of patients with impacted wisdom teeth were in the 15-25 years age group and 17% were aged between 36-45 years. Only 7% were above 45 years,” said Hashmi. He added that 89% of patients suffered bony impaction, while only 11% were found with soft tissue impactions.

Dr Hashmi's survey also showed 41% patients with impaction on the right side of jaw, and 39% having the problem on the left side. It also pointed out that 20% suffered with bilateral impaction.

AGRA: A man and his aide were sentenced to rigorous life imprisonment by Agra court for murder of his wife.

The accused, Rajeev Agrawal and his aid Santosh, were found guilty by the court of additional district judge XII, Shakeel Ur Rehman Khan on the charges of IPC section 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence).

On March 14, 2014, Rajeev Agrawal, living separately from his wife Seema Agrawal, brutally murdered her at his rented accomodation in Lashkarpur area under New Agra police jurisdiction.

Speaking to TOI, additional district government counsel Shashi Sharma said, “The horrific murder was witnessed by Rajeev’s two children Saurab and Shruti. In court trial, the two witnesses identified Rajeev as the killer.”

“Motive behind the murder was a loan of Rs 80,000 which Seema had given to her brother Rajesh Agrawal. When Rajeev came to know about the loan amount, he started pressurising Rajesh and Seema to return the money. When Rajesh failed to pay the amount on time, Rajeev murdered his wife. Prior to murder, the couple was living separately. Rajeev had called Seema at his home on the day of the crime,” added ADGC.

NEW DELHI: A long-standing turf war in outer Delhi’s Majra Dabas village probably ended in the murder of Pawan Anchil Thakur, who was sprayed with bullets while travelling in his SUV near Ladpur village in outer Delhi on Wednesday. Two members of the Deepak Titri gang have been identified for being involved in his murder.

Auchandi border, the area where Thakur was shot, doesn’t have CCTV coverage. The killers waylaid Thakur in an i20 car and fired 48 rounds, 26 of which hit him. A resident of Majra Dabas village, Thakur had allegedly shot at one of Titri’s associates last year and was jailed. He was given bail in January.

Police have learnt that Thakur had gone to Ladpur village to meet someone. On his way back, while he was about to take a U-turn, the killers intercepted him. Cops suspect that Thakur might have tried to fire at them, but was hit by several rounds. The criminals fled towards Haryana border after the murder. Police suspect the car used for committing the crime was stolen.

Thakur’s body was sent for autopsy at Sanjay Gandhi hospital. The body was handed to his family members on Thursday. Sources said it took nearly three hours for the doctors to remove the bullets from the body. Three X-rays were conducted to locate the bullets.

Sources said Thakur had aligned himself with the Tillu gang after striking a rivalry with Titri, who is suspected to be a close associate of Gogi. The role of Gogi’s henchmen in the murder has not been ruled out. Gogi had used similar modus operandi in murders committed earlier.

Senior officers said that gang wars, which had erupted in the early 1990s with rival groups trying to control land, got subdued after a series of arrests by Delhi Police. However, this created space for new criminals to step in. The new ganglords offered protection to landowners for a share in the real estate pie.

Sources said that gangs have started hiring contract killers for settling their disputes, since it keeps them off the hook. The killers are former members of the gangs that operated in the 1990s or early 2000s seeking an opportunity to take revenge. All logistical support is provided by the gangs that hire them.

AHMEDABAD: The Appendix I of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) includes species that are facing a ‘very high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future.’On Thursday, India moved to include the Asian Elephant , the great Indian bustard and the Bengal florican to the Appendix I of CMS at the Committee of Whole (COW) which unanimously cleared the proposal. The proposal will now be sent for final voting to the plenary session of the conference of parties (COP) to the CMS scheduled on Saturday.In its rationale for including GIB in Appendix I, India cited seasonal fluctuation in numbers of GIB indicating cross-border movement. The government submitted that inclusion of the species, which has only about 150-odd birds left, in Appendix I will help range countries take immediate steps for its conservation including curbs on hunting. The proposal was supported by Saudi Arabia, European Union, Ecuador, Senegal, Peru, Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), Bolivia, Somalia, Corbett Foundation and Young Naturalist Network. Pakistan, the range country where GIBs stray from India, was not present at the meeting.In its proposal for the Bengal florican, India said the species was on verge of extinction due to habitat loss, habitat degradation and hunting. The species no longer breeds outside protected areas except in a few pockets in the Brahmapurtra flood plains. The bird’s migratory range includes India, Nepal and Bangladesh. In its supporting statement, Bangladesh said the bird has become extinct in that country and no sightings have been recorded since 1882. India’s proposal to include Bengal florican in Appendix I was supported by the European Union, Costa Rica and the Bombay Nature History Society.India stated that mainland Asian elephants or Indian elephants are trying to survive in a continually shrinking, degraded and fragmented habitat.

101,['21/02/2020'],‘Cut’ practice keeping contractors away from water project: Jaleel,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Aurangabad: MP Imtiaz Jaleel on Friday said that the alleged bribe in the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) is keeping contractors and agencies away from the Rs 1,680 crore water project of the city.

Speaking at a press conference at the government guest house in the city on Friday, Jaleel said that the agencies are aware that if they pick a project of the AMC, they will be asked for bribe. Therefore, many prefer to stay away from the tenders invited for Rs 1,680 crore water scheme. Currently, only two agencies have technically qualified the financial bid.

“No agencies were willing to bid for the tender because they know that there are people in the AMC who will ask for their cut for any project related to the civic body,” MP said.

Jaleel also spoke about the irregularities in the ward reservation of the municipal corporation.

“In the district planning committee meeting held on January 30, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar made a statement which I completely agree with. Pointing at Shiv Sena, Pawar Pawar said that 8 to 10 corporators of the AMC run the entire business,” Jaleel said.

The MP said that the Aurangabad municipal commissioner should engage a high-level agency to inquire about the bills against which payments were issued by the AMC. “Enquiry should be initiated to see whose area saw the sanctioning of most bills and that too without any work on ground in the last couple of years. The municipal commissioner has decided to lodge an FIR against officials (those failing to produce measurement books).They should be booked under stringent sections because they are hand in gloves for the corruption going in the civic body for the last several years,” Jaleel said.

Irregularities in the

ward formation

MIM state president Imtiyaz Jaleel stated that the irregularities in the ward formation process for AMC elections are quite evident. “I personally met state election commissioner UPS Madan and discussed the irregularities observed in ward formation process. However, several complaints had emerged in the ward formation and we are taking them up,” Jaleel said.

YS Jaganmohan Reddy

HYDERABAD: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) probing into the India Cements episode of YS Jaganmohan Reddy assets case has contended that Rs 140 crore made as investment by N Srinivasan and his India Cements company in various firms were proceeds of crime, made on the basis of high share value projected by Jagan firms.

The investments in 2007-2008 were made in Bharati Cements, Jagathi Publications and Carmel Asia Holdings, the Enforcement Directorate said.

Opposing quash pleas filed by India Cements and its MD Srinivasan, the Enforcement Directorate said a running firm like India Cements, which is one of the major players in the cement industry, bought shares of Bharati Cement, which was yet to commence operations, at 1300 per cent higher value, indicating that it was not an investment but bribe it paid for benefits it derived unduly from Andhra Pradesh government during the chief ministerial tenure of Jagan’s father YS Rajasekhara Reddy.

India Cements, according to the chargesheet filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), in the same case derived benefits like land, limestone allotments, additional water allocations, etc. In turn, it made huge investments in Jagan firms and the CBI is calling it a quid pro quo arrangement.

The Enforcement Directorate, in its counter, also said that India Cements sold the shares it acquired in Bharati Cements to a French company for Rs 121 crore and re-invested the same in Jagan’s firms.

The Enforcement Directorate, however, said in another para in the same counter that India Cements used this Rs 121 crore to clear its loans borrowed from HDFC bank, etc. The high court posted the case to April 15 for further hearing.

110,['21/02/2020'],BJD woman leader dies 8 days after setting self on fire,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Berhampur: A BJD women wing’s leader, who tried to set herself on fire on the premises of the Berhampur SP’s office in protest against her son’s arrest, succumbed to injuries at a private hospital in Bhubaneswar on Thursday.

The woman, 41-year-old Meenakshi Mishra of Panda Colony, under Baidynathpur police station limits, attempted self-immolation on February 12 claiming her son Krutibash Mishra, nicknamed Raja, was falsely implicated in an assault case. Meenakshi had poured kerosene over her and set herself on fire.

Sources said Meenakshi was initially admitted to MKCG Medical College and Hospital with 70 per cent burns and was later referred to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack after her condition deteriorated. She was finally taken to a private hospital in Bubaneswar, where she passed away. Raja, who is out on bail since February 13, was in the hospital along with her sister and some local BJD leaders.

Meenakshi, who was the chairperson of a women’s organization, had unsuccessfully contested in the Berhampur Municipal Corporation polls (ward number 39) on a BJD ticket.

When asked whether the police would take a lenient view of Raja’s action following his mother’s death, BP Pati, sub-divisional police officer of Berhmapur, said, “The incident is unfortunate but the police will not show any leniency towards Raja. We have registered a case. The trial will happen according to law.” Sources said Raja was arrested by the police on January 28 in an assault case. Police had earlier claimed Raja had seven cases registered against him in the past.

Deepak Patnaik, Raja’s advocate, said, “Raja is out on interim bail till February 24 to look after his mother. We will pray for an extension to his bail so that he can perform her last rites.”

Ruling BJD leaders described the incident as unfortunate. “It’s sad and unfortunate,” senior BJD leader and former MLA (Berhampur) R Ch Chyaupatnik said. The women’s wing of BJD’s Ganjam district unit had earlier submitted a memorandum to the Berhampur SP and demanded an impartial inquiry into the matter.

Opposition party leaders said the government failed to deliver justice to Meenakshi, forcing her to commit suicide. “We demand a high-level inquiry into the matter,” BJP’s Ganjam district president Bibhuti Jena said. Pitabash Panda, former working president of the district’s Congress committee, said the police had failed her.

NAGPUR: Senior divisional commercial manager (DCM), South Eastern Central Railway ( SECR ), KV Ramana has been booked for allegedly outraging modesty of a booking clerk and also charged with provisions under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

The senior railway officer denied the allegations claiming them to be frivolous. Ramana also said he was being framed for no reason.

A 47-year-old booking clerk, promoted few days ago and shifted to Gondia, stated in her police complaint that Ramana had been making undue advances towards her. She alleged that Ramana tried to misbehave with her on phone and also during personal meeting.

The woman stated that Ramana met her during an inspection at a railway station and since then been trying to lure her with indecent proposals for helping in her career.

The woman had first approached the Shanti Nagar police station but later decided to meet the city police top brass when cops refused to register an offence. Shanti Nagar police, following intervention of the top brass, registered the case and referred it to the superintendent of police, Government Railway Police (GRP).

Senior PI KB Uikey of Shanti Nagar police station stated that the alleged undue advances by the concerned officer took place mostly within limits of the railways. “We had received an application from her about two days back. The case isn’t under city police jurisdiction and hence we have sent it to the concerned GRP unit,” he said.

After coming to know about the FIR against him, Ramana said he had called the woman only once to his office and spoke in presence of women personnel. “She was promoted along with 55 others and routinely transferred,” he said.

Ramana stated that he had called the woman as there was a problem between her and the supervisor at office. “There was no other intention but to intervene as a senior,” he said.

114,['21/02/2020'],Padil RuB inches closer to opening,"This story is from February 21, 2020

New railway underbridge at Padil on Mangaluru-Bengaluru National Highway 75.

Mangaluru: People are hopeful of the railway underbridge (RuB) at Padil being opened for traffic at the earliest. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and Southern Railway , that seemed in no apparent hurry to commission the RuB constructed on the carriageway towards the city on the Bengaluru-Mangaluru National Highway-75 on the city’s outskirts, are now looking to complete the remaining work to facilitate its commissioning.

Incidentally, the RuB on the carriageway towards Bengaluru was commissioned in December 2017 and the pre-cast concrete box for the RuB towards Mangaluru was in place by January 2019. Officials in the construction wing of Southern Railway had cited non-removal of trees and shifting of electrical installations as the reason for not commissioning the RuB. Initially, the plan was to commission this second RuB towards Mangaluru by January.

Shishu Mohan, project director, NHAI project implementation unit, Mangaluru, told TOI that the commissioning of the second RuB towards Mangaluru will help ease traffic congestion at Mangaluru. The construction wing of Southern Railway has almost completed their work, and NHAI will need around 15 days to lay bituminous concrete to a length of 1.1 km to connect the two ends of the road via the new RuB towards Mangaluru, he said.

Barricades have been fixed on either end of the new RuB, dimensions of which have been fixed as per Indian Road Congress standards to prevent oversized vehicles from using the same. Painting work of the RuB too has been completed. Incidentally, this ‘new’ RuB was earlier the only RuB that existed on the Bengaluru-Mangaluru National Highway at Padil. The second RuB was constructed on the road leading towards Bengaluru as part of the four-laning project.

The two RuBs are part of the port connectivity four-laning project on NH-75 between B C Road and Nanthoor in the city that started in 2003. The move by NHAI to collect toll for this 36 km stretch of four-lane road – at Brahmarakootlu and Surathkal—too has irked road users—as its maintenance is not of desired standards. The delay in addressing above bottlenecks has only given users a chance to vent their ire against NHAI for their perceived apathy.

University of Hyderabad

HYDERABAD: Students of University of Hyderabad ( UoH ) raised an alarm over encroachment within the campus on Thursday after an earth mover demolished a university compound wall.

Around 12 pm, an earth mover demolished a compound wall towards near Mushroom rocks area. Students alleged that the demolition work was taken up following orders from a local MLA.

“The demolition work was being undertaken citing an order that the collector had passed to construct a road to CNG Colony. Those involved in demolition stated that the land was promised by a former vice-chancellor,” said Abhishek Nandan, president of UoH students union. Students opposed the demolition as they claimed that persons involved could not produce relevant documents.

UoH authorities have taken up the matter with the district collector.

“In the past, we had to reconstruct the wall twice as some miscreants had demolished them overnight. On Thursday, an earth mover was used to tear down the wall again,” said P Singh, UoH registrar, adding that filed a complaint with Gachibowli police.

“We had even requested the collector to survey the university land to curb such encroachments. We are yet to receive the survey report following which we will decide further course of action,” added Sardar Singh.

118,['21/02/2020'],Fund-starved Telangana govt mulls auctioning assigned land,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Representative image

HYDERABAD: In a massive exercise to prop up revenue mobilisation, the state government is planning to take over thousands of assigned land given to farmers in prime areas — especially Ranga Reddy and Medchal districts — and auction it at market rate. Official sources said that collectors of districts surrounding Hyderabad have been asked to identify assigned land in their respective areas which was lying fallow.

With no major chunks of vacant land available around the city as most of it has already been given to companies, auctioned or encroached, the state was now looking at assigned land allotted to farmers several decades ago for cultivation but without ownership rights. The government has the power to resume such land whenever it wants and, as there was little farming around Hyderabad, it now intends to compensate farmers and then auction the land.

As a precursor, a sample survey was done in five villages of Ranga Reddy district and it was estimated that the assigned land was worth over Rs 3,500 crore if auctioned.

“There are 1,450 acres in five villages — Kongara Khurd, Thummaloor, Raviryal (near Shamshabad airport) villages in Maheshwaram mandal, Madhapur in Kandukur mandal and Rayannaguda in Shamshabad mandal — and it could fetch about Rs 3,580 crore. After paying about Rs 1,220 crore as compensation to farmers, the government would get nearly Rs 2,360 crore,” an official said.

Apart from assigned land, the state government has already indicated its plans to auction government land to raise funds which would be used for executing irrigation projects and welfare schemes.

The Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) is planning to auction about 600 acres in Kokapet and the layout was being developed. The Ranga Reddy administration has reported that there was about 665 acres (including evacuee property) in Puppalaguda but no available assigned land in the area. Of the 665 acres, 188 acres was clear and unassigned land which could be auctioned, official sources said.

“Once the government gets all the land details, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is likely to take a decision on acquiring assigned land as well as auctioning government land around the city,” said a senior official in the chief minister’s office.

120,['21/02/2020'],"Nirbhaya convict is back in court, this time with mental illness plea","This story is from February 21, 2020

New Delhi: A court on Thursday sought a reply from the Tihar Jail authorities on a plea by Vinay Sharma , a death-row convict in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, that he be given better treatment due to his mental condition, including schizophrenia, and head and arm injuries. Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana directed the authorities to file its reply on Saturday.

According to prison officials, Sharma injured himself by banging his head on his solitary cell wall in jail number 3 on Sunday afternoon. He suffered minor injuries and was treated on the Tihar premises, they said.

Advocate A P Singh, appearing for Sharma, told the court that “it was a serious matter” that the convict couldn’t recognise people, including his mother and lawyer. The lawyer claimed that while visiting his client on the family’s request, he had found Sharma had sustained a grievous head injury, had a plaster in his right arm due to a fracture, and was suffering from “insanity, mental illness and schizophrenia”.

Singh also claimed that the jail records would prove that Sharma had attempted suicide thrice in Tihar and was treated for depression.

The prosecution, however, opposed the plea arguing it was not maintainable. It termed the plea as a delaying tactic.

Meanwhile, according to an IANS report, Sharma’s counsel also moved the Election Commission of India challenging the rejection of his mercy petition. The rejection was suggested by Delhi government and signed by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia when the model code of conduct for the assembly elections was in force. The code made him “ineligible” to do so, Singh said, adding that a WhatsApp screenshot was sent instead of Sisodia’s digital signature while forwarding the plea to the lieutenant governor of Delhi.

After the LG sent it to the Union home ministry, it went to the President of India, who rejected the plea after considering the MHA’s suggestion.

Thursday’s petitions were filed after the court, on February 17, for the third time, issued death warrants for March 3 to execute the four convicts. Besides Sharma, the other convicts are Mukesh Singh, Pawan Gupta and Akshay Thakur.

Any further delay in their execution will be “sacrilegious” to the rights of the victim and for justice, the court had noted while fixing the new date.

Bhubaneswar: Despite a huge collection of funds under the District Mineral Foundation (DMF) and the Odisha Mineral Bearing Area Development Corporation (OMBADC), the utilisation by the state government remains low.

Of the total collection of Rs 9,501.48 crore under the DMF by January-end, only Rs 2,794.19 crore has been spent. Similarly, about Rs 16,520 crore has been generated under the OMBADC of which only Rs 1,143 crore has been utilised. This was informed by state planning and convergence minister Padmanabha Behera in a written reply to a query from BJD MLA Soumya Ranjan Patnaik in the assembly on Thursday.

Both the DMF and OMBADC are meant for infrastructure development in areas where people are affected by mining activities. Drinking water supply, education, healthcare facilities, sanitation, skill development, housing, connectivity, livelihood programmes and environment conservation are some of the priority areas, where the government utilises money from the DMF and the OMBADC funds. The OMBADC was constituted in 2014 with contribution from mining lessees with the amount they paid for diversion of forest land (Rs 7 to 9 lakh per hectare) for mining purpose. The penalties collected from the lessees for illegal mining based on a Supreme Court order delivered on August 2, 2017, is also deposited in the OMBADC fund.

A committee headed by the chief secretary has already sanctioned projects worth Rs 9,084 crore from the DMF fund for various areas. There has been delay in implementation of projects for reasons like lack of adequate professionals at sub-ordinate offices and lack of planning to utilise the amount, said a senior government official, requesting anonymity.

While all the districts have DMF fund, resources from the OMBADC are being utilised only in eight mining-hit districts — Angul, Dhenkanal, Jajpur, Jharsuguda, Keonjhar, Koraput, Mayurbhanj and Sundargarh.

Thiruvananthapuram: Health minister K K Shailaja has said Medical College Hospital of Thiruvananthapuram will be made into an apex centre of trauma care and training. Since there is space constraint on the college campus, the training centre will be functioning at a new building constructed on the General Hospital campus.

The minister said the centre will provide training on trauma care to the doctors in the health service and medical education department. Apart from this, para medical staff, nurses, ambulance drivers and employees concerned will be trained on trauma care. The centre will also provide training for police personnel, NGOs working in this field and even for the common man.

Tata Trust has given Rs 12 crore for setting up the centre and the work is nearing completion. Apart from this, Rs 12 crore was sanctioned for the centre in the state budget, she said.

The funds sanctioned will be utilised to set up cardiology and angiography simulation trainer, surgical skill trainer and other related equipment. With this, a training centre will be fulfilled under the medical education department.

Shailaja said the government had already entered into an agreement with the Tata Trust for sharing their expertise in this. The centre will be run by the Tata Trust for the first three years and then will be handed over to the health department.

The centre is set up as part of the comprehensive trauma care programme being launched in all medical college hospitals in the state. The programme is planned in the state with the support of University of Warwick, UK, and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.

As per the proposal, three levels of trauma-care system will be implemented in the state, apart from the emergency department in all medical college hospitals and the simulation centre.

All medical college hospitals will come under level one trauma-care management. District and general hospitals come under second level, and taluk and community health centres under the third.

Nagpur: Senior corporator Satish Holey accused the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) of violating all guidelines and norms, including those prescribed by the Indian Road Congress, while constructing cement roads. Following the allegations, mayor Sandip Joshi ordered superintending engineer Manoj Talewar to conduct an inquiry and submit a report before the House.

Despite going through a financial crisis, the NMC is constructing over a feet thick roads while the National Highways Authority of India has constructed only six-inch thick road patch from Liberty Square to Mankapur Square, said Holey.

Holey sought to know criteria for selecting any tar road for converting it into cement concrete. When Talewar informed that the NMC is selecting the roads as per traffic density, Holey said that even internal lanes which witness less traffic were being concretized. He also alleged that the administration selects tar roads for concretization only after a nod from the standing committee chairman.

The NMC didn’t even mention about usage of fly-ash in constructing cement roads, he said.

Leader of opposition Tanaji Wanve drew attention of the House to violations of environmental norms by cement road contractors and gave example of ready-mix plants operating in residential areas though they are supposed to be outside city limits.

Puducherry: The Students’ Federation of India (SFI) along with other students’ forums in Pondicherry University has decided to hold a black flag demonstration on February 25 , a day before the visit of vice-president Venkaiah Naidu to the university to press the administration to revoke fees hike for all courses from the academic year 2019-20 and to fulfill their other demands.

Naidu, also the chancellor of the university, will visit Pondicherry University on February 26 to award degrees to the students at the convocation ceremony.

The forums appealed to the students to boycott classes and participate in large numbers in the demonstration on Tuesday. They lashed out at the university for hiking the fees steeply. They pointed out that the highest annual fees for any course in JNU is just Rs 500 and the highest annual fees for any course in all the 49 central universities (barring Pondicherry University) is less than Rs 10,000. The fees structure for all courses in Pondicherry University has been fixed exorbitantly high compared to other central universities.

“The total fees for most-sought-after courses like MBA and MCA programmes in Pondicherry University are Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 1.03 lakh respectively,” said a students’ representative.

The forums also demanded the administration to continue free transportation facility for day scholars. The university extended free transportation facility since its inception, but the present administration has imposed a transportation fee of Rs 4,000 a year for a day scholar.

Meanwhile, the indefinite strike launched by the students’ council against fees hike since February 6 entered the 15th day on Thursday. The fee revision committee formed by the university with representatives of the administration and students, which convened twice, failed to resolve the impasse. The committee came forward to waive 20% fees for economically weaker sections, while the students’ representatives demanded 100% rollback of hike.

On Wednesday, representatives of students’ forums called on chief minister V Narayanasamy in the presence of DMK MLA R Siva and urged him to ask the university administration to revoke the fee hike . The representatives also sought the intervention of the chief minister in securing 25% reservation for Puducherry students in all courses in the university.

However, the university administration in a statement on Thursday justified the fee hike claiming that it did not revise the fees for the last 10 years and hiked it for all courses from 2019-20 by 25% to 50%.

Nirbhaya case convicts

NEW DELHI: The four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case are being counselled for anger management in Tihar Jail after two of them, Mukesh Singh and Vinay Sharma, allegedly showed traits of violent behaviour even when prison staff approached them for routine checks. The behaviour of Pawan Gupta and Akshay Thakur is also under scanner, a source said.

In the past one week, Sharma misbehaved with jail officials while being served meals or asked to comply with the prison rules, the source said. Singh has also refused to comply with orders, he added.

Sharma, who has approached a court demanding that he be treated at Institute of Human Behaviour & Allied Sciences, however, didn’t show any sign of being mentally unstable during the tests conducted by counsellors, an official said. In addition to its in-house counsellor, Tihar has tied up with an NGO comprising of mental health experts who keep monitoring both inmates and jail officials.

The convicts can meet family members twice a week. After Sharma met his mother on Monday, his lawyer claimed the convict couldn’t recognise her. Jail officials, however, didn’t find anything unusual during the meeting.

Besides keeping all four convicts on a suicide watch in their solitary cells, the authorities are keeping an eye on their behaviour when they are meeting their family members or lawyers. A close watch is also being kept when they are out of the view of CCTV cameras or are in the bathroom. “A guard is specifically deployed to check on them if they take longer than usual to complete their chores,” said an official. They can meet each other only in the presence of a jail staffer.

To maintain their health, the convicts are kept on a simple diet. They are allowed to keep one set of clothes and only essential personal belongings.

BHOPAL: Several government employees, including members of MP Forest Employees’ Association, took to the streets on Thursday to protest against the registration of murder case against 14 forest personnel following the shooting of a Dalit in Shivpuri.

The protesters submitted a memorandum to the district collector and SP, saying that the action against forest employees was uncalled for. They argue that the firing was in self-defence and some of the employees who have been charged with murder were not even on the spot at the time of incident. Six of the 14 accused forest personnel have been arrested and all of them are in jail custody.

“We have arrested forest guard Ram Naresh, who had fired the shot from his licensed weapon. As of now, we have not found any evidence to indicate that there was a situation that led him to use his weapon. We have received memorandum from the forest employees and their points will be taken into consideration,” said SP Shivpuri Rajesh Singh Chandel.

On February 16, a Dalit was shot dead in Shivpuri’s Fatehpur village, allegedly by a forest department employee, during an altercation between his family and foresters over filling of water from a hand pump. The family of victim Madan Balmiki alleges that forest personnel humiliated them when they were drawing water from a tube well near the Fatehpur outpost. It triggered an altercation during which Madan was shot dead.

A case was registered against 14 forest department personnel, including a woman, under IPC and SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act.

The forest department, on the other hand, claims stones were thrown at them during an anti-encroachment drive and Madan was shot when some villagers were trying to snatch a gun.

Madan’s wife and cousin were washing utensils at the hand pump when ranger Suresh Sharma came to fill his waterbottle and a few drops of water spilled on him. He got angry and hurled casteist remarks at them, says the FIR. Madan’s wife says in the FIR: “My daughter ran over and told him not to abuse us. But a woman forester dragged her by the hair and slapped her. When my husband came running to intervene, he was shot dead,” says the complaint.

NEW DELHI: That the leadership vacuum in Congress is percolating to state units and hampering their functioning was evident Thursday when Karnataka Congress functionary Dinesh Gundu Rao , who earlier resigned as state party chief, met Sonia Gandhi and urged that his replacement be named soon.

“Our workers and leaders are in a state of confusion. It's been two months since I resigned as state party president. Let's not delay this further because it sends wrong signal,” he told reporters.

There are concerns that AICC has failed to appoint new presidents in key states of Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, where organisation is witnessing clashes.

While Jyotiraditya Scindia is locked in a war of nerves with chief minister Kamal Nath in MP, a senior leader from Maharashtra said the situation in the state is not comfortable despite formation of coalition government with Shiv Sena and NCP.

“There is an urgency about having a new organisational chief here. But there is a drift here which is reflective of the drift in AICC,” he lamented.

Besides, the leadership is worried about growing dissent in Punjab unit with individual MLAs speaking out against the Amarinder Singh dispensation. Sources said Congress brass recently met Navjot Sidhu , in what was a bid to pacify him. Sidhu resigned from the Punjab Cabinet after a spat with CM Amarinder Singh, and there are rumours that he may go out of the party.

133,['21/02/2020'],Use recovered land for MG Road expansion project: Experts,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Merchants say commercial activities in the area have come down at least by 40% after Metro construction began

KOCHI: Over the past four or five years MG Road has been losing its importance as a major commercial hub. Reason? Traffic snarls and lack of adequate parking facilities.

Though revenue department had recovered more than 80 cents by evicting encroachers on the MG Road in 2007, authorities have not yet moved to use the land for road expansion.

According to details collected as per a RTI reply, 287 encroachments were identified during the eviction drive, which had to be stopped mid-way due to pressure from vested interests and political parties. Had the drive not been stopped abruptly, more encroachments on Jos junction-Thevara stretch also could have been evicted.

The current market value of the 80 cents has been pegged at around Rs160 crore. What is shocking is that encroachers have been reclaiming the evicted holdings again.

“Parking and traffic blocks have been plaguing MG Road for long. Using the 80 cents, Kochi Corporation or Smart City authorities could have constructed bus bays and multilevel carparking facilities,” said president of Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi , K S Dileep Kumar.

“It would have helped MG Road regain its lost glory,” he said.

At many points, there are land parcels, mostly reclaimed from encroachers, where bus bays and car parking facilities can be set up.

“Such facilities can be set up on the lands near Seematti Textiles, Padma Junction, Jayalakshmi Silks and Woodlands Junction. Unfortunately, many of the holdings are being encroached upon again,” Kumar said.

According to experts in urban planning, authorities can explore other options. “Authorities like Kochi Corporation can set up parking facilities under public private partnership model, wherever government land is unavailable. The local body should identify the vacant lands on MG Road and ink pact with the owners of such holdings. Several land owners fear that it will be difficult for them to get back the land once it is given to a public project. The authorities should first allay such fears and give a written assurance to them,” said Elizabeth Philip, urban planning and former chief town planner, Greater Cochin Development Authority .

“As of now, many of the shops on MG Road have converted their parking lots into commercial spaces. The corporation should find a way to make the merchants pay up for the loss without demolishing the structures,” she said.

“Fixed amounts can be charged from such establishments. The funds can be used for providing parking facilities,” she said.

The merchants have also said that they are ready to cooperate with the authorities if there is an action plan to revive MG Road.

“We have created a Facebook page called Save MG Road. Commercial activities have come down at least by 40% after Metro construction began. They had promised to provide parking facilities once the Metro work has been completed. But no one has taken up the issue,” said Rajesh Nair, convener, MG Road Merchants Association.

BHOPAL: A year-long march called ‘Jai Jagat 2020’, carrying Mahatma Gandhi ’s message of non-violence, reached Armenia on its 14,000km-long journey on Thursday, walking in minus-16-degree freeze. Several of the participants are from Gwalior-Chambal region and Bhopal.

The journey that started from Raj Ghat in New Delhi will end in Geneva, Switzerland, where a dialogue will take place with UN agencies on implementation of UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The rallyists had to cancel the Pakistan and Nepal legs of the route following visa issues. The journey is being covered on foot and by train, plane and ferry.

The Bhopal-headquartered Gandhian organisation Ekta Parishad is organizing the march. Its national president, Morena resident Ran Singh Parmar, is leading the first batch that arrived in Armenia on Thursday. According to official sources, this team walked through snow on the mountains of Armenia at close to minus-16 degrees Celsius, carrying Gandhian principles of non-violence and peace.

“The Parliament of Armenia actually took a break during their discussion to acknowledge and welcome the Jai Jagat march, and emphasized that the world needs a Gandhian path of compassion and justice,” said a press release.

“While our team largely comprises Indians who are not acclimatized to this weather, we are all filled with optimism and enthusiasm for the challenge ahead,” said Pravin Jha, communication coordinator-Regional Building Domestic Resource Mobilization Capacities of CSOs (Co-funded by European Union & Supported by Welthungerhilfe) Mahatma Gandhi Seva Ashram.

The Yatra started on October 2, 2019 — Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary — and comprises 50 walkers, led by P V Rajagopal ji and Jill Carl Harris. “The march has completed its main India chapter, spanning 2,000 kilometres in 125 days, and a part of the team is now in Armenia. There are 35 Indian and 15 international team members in the march,” Jha added. Eight to 10 of the padyatris are from Bhopal.

The rest of the team is now moving through Iran and UAE. There are marchers across the world, including North Africa and Europe, walking in solidarity with Jai Jagat Yatra, said Jha. The four key objectives of the march are eradicating poverty, eliminating social exclusion, battling climate crisis and halting conflict and violence.

“We started our march in Armenia from Meghri, which is on the Armenia-Iran border. We had informed both governments about the march, and they were both very positive about the idea of invoking Gandhi during these troubled times for the world,” said Jha.

This team interacted with students and teachers in schools and visited the National Medical University in capital Yerevan. Since Armenians had used Gandhian ideals for a nonviolent revolution in 2018, the Mahatma holds aspecial place in their hearts.

NEW DELHI: At least 152 people have been confirmed positive for swine flu in Delhi as on February 16, a data released by National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), a central health body, shows.

While no death has been reported from the capital yet, hospitals said there have been a few admissions among patients suffering from the viral illness .

“Admission is required in cases involving bilateral pneumonia and other severe symptoms. It is rare and happens mostly in elderly persons and those with pre-existing chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease,” said Dr Atul Gogia, senior consultant, internal medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. He, however, added that similar symptoms were exhibited even among persons suffering from seasonal influenza virus.

“Swine flu or H1N1 exists since 2009. It is a seasonal influenza only and people with milder symptoms like common cold, cough or fever need not undergo tests to confirm the strain of virus causing illness because these diseases are self-limiting,” said Dr Mukesh Mehra, senior consultant, internal medicine, Max Patparganj.

Last year, Delhi had reported 3,627 cases of H1N1 of which 31 persons had died. The death toll across the country was 1,218 in 2019, the NCDC data revealed.

The latest update on H1N1 situation in the country shows 884 persons have been diagnosed positive for H1N1 over the last one-and-a half-months and there have been 14 deaths . Tamil Nadu reported the maximum cases (172), followed by Delhi (152), Karnataka (151) and Telangana (148).

Swine flu is a contagious respiratory disease caused by type A strain of the influenza virus. It enters the body through inhalation of contaminated droplets, or is transferred from a contaminated surface to the eyes, nose or mouth of a person. “The symptoms of swine flu are similar to common viral illnesses. Patients feel lethargic, have high-grade fever and sore throat, among other symptoms. The treatment is mostly symptomatic,” said a doctor .

He added that maintaining hygiene was the most important. “People should wash their hands at regular intervals with disinfectants. If there is prolonged fever, one must see a doctor and not ignore symptoms such as difficulty in breathing,” he said.

Three of the rescued reptiles are Indian tent turtles, a rare species found in northeast India.

NEW DELHI: Crime Branch has rescued four endangered tent turtles from the Kashmere Gate ISBT . It is a rare breed that comes under Schedule1 of the Wildlife Act. Police suspect the role of an interstate gang operating from north-east India that deals in trade of illegal wildlife.

Police said that a team led a search near Mori Gate on Wednesday night and found the turtles kept in a cardboard box. It seemed that someone had hurriedly left the box at the municipal corporation parking and fled. On inspection, it was found that three of the four turtles were Indian tent turtles that are a rare species of the reptiles found in Northeast India.

The turtles were inspected by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) and shifted to the Delhi zoo for medical check-up. The reptiles would be kept in captivity till a clearance is received to release them in the wild.

Police are scanning the CCTV footage from the parking to identify the people who were transporting the turtles. The reptiles are usually slaughtered for meat or sold as exotic creatures in foreign countries.

A Delhi zoo official confirmed the rescue, stating the turtles were handed over to them by WCCB on Thursday afternoon. “They will be monitored for the next 15-20 days. After that, we may release them into ponds or they may become a part of the reptile house,” said the official.

Thiruvananthapuram: The state commission for protection of child rights has launched a probe into the mysterious disappearances of two schoolboys, Rahul, 15, and Abhijith, 16, from their homes in the city. Rahul had gone missing on Saturday night and Abhijith on Sunday afternoon. While Rahul, who went missing from his residence at Kannammoola, is yet to be traced, Abhijith was found dead in the Karamana river not far away from his residence at Nedumcaud near Karamana.

The commission has also demanded police to transfer the investigations from the local police to a special team. A senior officer not less than the rank of superintendent of police must conduct the investigation and an inspector general must supervise the probes, the commission demanded.

Commission chairperson P Suresh said on Thursday that he visited the parents of both boys and recorded their statements as part of the inquiry. “In Abhijith’s case, his parents have a doubt that his death could be owing to murder. He was stark naked when the body was found. The police are yet to recover clothes, adding mystery to the case,’’ Suresh said.

According to Rahul’s parents, he left home because they seized his secret mobile phone, the chairperson added. “His parents found out that he was using a mobile phone costing around Rs 2,500 and they seized it. It was after this he left home, allegedly stealing Rs 4,000 in cash from the house,’’ he said. In both the cases, the investigations by local police at Karamana and Medical College are yet to make any breakthrough. The city police are likely to issue a lookout notice in the name of Rahul in a bid to seek the help of the public in tracing the boy.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With its efforts in ensuring child nutrition and in the process of ending hidden hunger , the state will soon script a success story at par with most advanced societies not just in the country alone, but in whole world, governor Arif Mohammed Khan has said.

Inaugurating a nutrition conference with the theme ‘hidden hunger — challenges and way forward’ organized by the department of women and child development here on Thursday, the governor said the Sampoorna Thalika programme highlighted the need for a balanced, healthy and poison-free nutrition, right from childhood. “What is important is that Kerala’s internalization of the significance of mother and child welfare has yielded good results. These efforts have endowed Kerala with one of the lowest infant and maternal mortality rates. If our school education has been rated by Niti Aayog as the best in the country, it is partly due to the improved health of our children,” Khan said.

He lauded the efforts of health minister K K Shailaja and said the alertness, prompt action and the maternal concern of the minister for the health of women and children have given a new direction to health and nutrition in the state. He also appreciated the minister for leading the fight against Nipah and coronavirus (Covid-19).

The governor said if the country needs to end hunger in all its forms, “we need to begin with a broad definition of hunger”, which would include calorie deficiencies or chronic hunger, micro-nutrient deficiencies or hidden hunger and related health problems. “The provision of adequate nutrition has been seen as a key factor in our mission to reduce poverty and hunger. It is here that flagship schemes like National Nutrition Mission , better known as Poshan Abhiyaan, launched to prevent and reduce under-nutrition, gains relevance. This scheme covered adolescent girls, pregnant women, lactating mothers and children below six years, benefiting over 10 crore people,” he said.

The biggest challenges that the state is facing is the lifestyle diseases and communicable diseases, Shylaja said.

147,['21/02/2020'],Anil Deshmukh sets up team to prepare Disha Act like law for Maharashtra,"This story is from February 21, 2020

State home minister Anil Deshmukh

NAGPUR: State home minister Anil Deshmukh, who was in Andhra Pradesh (AP) on February 20 to study the newly implemented Disha Act, said on Thursday he had constituted a five-member team for having a similar law in the state. The panel will submit its report in a week after which it may be tabled before the cabinet. Deshmukh sounded hopeful to present the Bill as soon as possible in the assembly.

The team will be headed by IG Aswathi Dorje, an IPS officer of 2000-batch, now posted as director of Maharashtra Police Academy (MPA). The team was with Deshmukh on his tour of AP during which they met the CM YS Jaganmohan Reddy, home minister Mekatoti Sucharita and also woman and child development minister Taneti Vanitha. They discussed in detail the law that mandates capital punishment for rape and gang rape within 21 days which include seven days for investigation and remaining for trial in lower court.

AP government had formulated the Disha Act (Andhra Pradesh Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2019) following the gang rape and murder of the Hyderabad veterinarian in November last year. Following the national outrage, AP government had drafted the bill and passed it in their assembly within a month.

Deshmukh extolled the efforts of AP government that enforced the law just some time back. “The details of the enactment sounded strong,” he said. “We will see how our report on it shapes out,” said Deshmukh. He said express justice was possible in cases where accused are known and evidence is adequate.

Though the demand of having such an enactment in Maharashtra had been raised during the last winter session in the city, Deshmukh had reiterated the promise to expedite the process after his active intervention in the Ankita Pisudde case in which the contributory lecturer from Wardha was set afire near her college at Hinganghat on February 3.

Deshmukh had also promised Pisudde’s case would be also tried in a fast track court which is one of the highlights of the Disha Act. In the past, MVA’s first home minister Eknath Shinde, replying to calling attention motion of MLC Manisha Kayande in the Upper House, had underlined the significance of a Disha Act-like enactment in the state as a deterrent for atrocities against women and children.

Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik too had moved a private member bill in the assembly for such an enactment. Shinde had then informed that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had taken up the issue with the director general of police (DGP). He was to take suggestions from the state law and justice department into consideration. He had also stated that 25 special and 27 fast track courts were created for expediting trials in such cases.

INDORE: The Indore bench of MP high court has observed that state government is reluctant to share information on the honeytrap case with the Centre and asked it to explain why it should not be handed over to the CBI for investigation.

The observations were made by a division bench of Justice S C Sharma and Justice Shailendra Shukla on February 10 while rejecting an application of the state government that sought modifications in an earlier court order to hand over documents of the case to income tax department.

“In the present case, there is a reluctance on the part of the state government in giving documents to the Union of India for reasons best known to the state government. Therefore, the state government shall file a reply on the point of transferring the matter to Central Bureau of Investigation,” the bench said.

The court passed an interim order to the state to provide all details of the case to the Centre, following petition filed by income tax department for information in the honeytrap case. The HC set a deadline of 10 days for the state government to hand over documents related to the case to the centre. The state then filed an interlocutory petition, seeking modification in the order.

“This court really fails to understand why information is being withheld from Union of India, especially in light of the facts that there are a large number of cash transactions in the honeytrap case,” the judges observed, adding that the income tax department is “certainly competent to seek information” keeping in view Section 131(1A) of Income Tax Act, 1961.

155,['21/02/2020'],"GMR Airports sells 49% stake for Rs 10,700 crore to Paris airport developer","This story is from February 21, 2020

NEW DELHI: The GMR Group — India’s biggest private airport infra player — has picked Groupe ADP, formerly Aéroports de Paris, over a Tata Group-headed consortium to sell 49% stake in GMR Airports Limited (GAL) for Rs 10,780 crore. The deal, which values GMR Airports at Rs 22,000 crore, will see GAL getting Rs 5,248 crore immediately. Groupe ADP develops and manages airports, including Paris’s Charles de Gaulle, Orly and Le Bourget.

Last March, GIL had announced that a consortium of Tatas, GIC and SSG Capital Management will invest Rs 8,000 crore in GAL, valuing GMR Airports at almost Rs 22,500 crore. However, since Tata Group operates two airlines — Vistara and AirAsia India — airlines had been opposing its entry into the airport business.

In fact, now both the existing and upcoming airports of Delhi will have a strong European connection — ADP for Delhi and Flughafen Zurich, which is developing Greater Noida . Based on 2019 passenger statistics, the combined passengers handled by GMR Airports and Groupe ADP was 33.6 crore, the highest in the world.

Groupe ADP’s Rs 10,780-crore equity consideration, GMR Infra Limited said in a BSE filing, comprises of Rs 9,780 crore towards secondary sale of shares by GMR Group and Rs 1,000 crore equity infusion in GAL.

“Groupe ADP has also pegged earn-outs up to Rs 4,475 crore linked to achievement of certain agreed operating performance metrics as well as on receipt of certain regulatory clarifications over the next five years. Thereby, total valuation, assuming all above earn-outs are successfully consummated, may reach Rs 26,475 crore on post-money basis. The first tranche of Rs. 5,248 crore will be received by GMR Group immediately. This money will help deleverage the group further and result in improved cash flows and profitability,” the GIL regulatory filing said.

It added that “as part of the terms of transaction, GMR will retain management control over the airports business with Groupe ADP having the customary rights and board representation at GAL and its key subsidiaries”.

GMR Group chairman G M Rao said: “The partnership with Groupe ADP is in line with GMR’s business direction to become a global airport developer and operator. We have been on a journey of defining airports of the future with key focus on passenger experience by leveraging enhanced technology and offering superior amenities. With Groupe ADP, GMR will have smoother access to global markets, opening up newer avenues of business growth.”

Aéroports de Paris SA-Groupe ADP chairman and CEO Augustin de Romanet said: “The acquisition of a 49% stake in GMR Airports fits within Groupe ADP’s strategy. It sets a robust industrial partnership and enables Groupe ADP to build, only two years after taking control of TAV Airports, a unique worldwide network of airports with a solid industrial expertise and strong development capacities. This acquisition will constitute a growth driver in the medium term, and also a transforming position for the group in one of Asia’s and the world’s most dynamic and promising countries.”

Passengers began disembarking from the ship, which was quarantined for a fortnight, on Wednesday.The family’s worry has been exacerbated by the fact that two persons who contracted the virus on the ship died on Thursday, and one more Indian crew member tested positive for the disease. There are 138 Indians — 132 crew and six passengers — on board the ship. Of them, eight crew have tested positive for coronavirus .

KOCHI: Pavan Doot electric bus service, an initiative to provide connectivity between airport and Aluva Metro station, was flagged off on Thursday by Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial) managing director VJ Kurien and Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) managing director Alkesh Kumar Sharma.

The fare is fixed as Rs 50 for a single journey ticket. The buses will be available from both Aluva Metro station and Cial every 40 minutes. The first service to Aluva Metro station will begin at 5am and the first service to Cial will begin at 5.40am. The last service to Aluva Metro station will be at 10.30pm and the last bus heading to Cial will be at 11.10pm.

“It is a great start to a much-awaited partnership. Within a short time, KMRL signed an agreement with KSRTC to operate e-buses. With the introduction of these buses, it will be possible to find out how many commuters will take the Metro to reach the airport,” said Sharma, adding that the launch of these services was possible because of support from Cochin International Airport.

KMRL has planned airport connectivity as part of its its phase-three extension. The introduction of feeder services is viewed as the first step towards achieving the goal. “There are 12,000 people working at the airport. They will also benefit from the project,” said Kurien.

However, there has been an apprehension regarding extension of Metro to the airport as there are doubts about its viability. Passengers travelling to or from the airport generally carry huge luggage and Metro has restrictions on luggage sizes.

Shuttle services between Aluva Metro station and Cial have always been considered as a more viable option.

Representative image

KOCHI: The high court on Thursday asked the state government to inform what action has been taken regarding the alleged missing of 25 rifles and 12,061 live cartridges from Kerala Police .

A division bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly asked the steps taken on the basis of the report by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) while considering during admission hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) by P P Ramachandra Kaimal of Changanassery through advocate R Krishna Raj. A probe by CBI or NIA has been sought by the petitioner.

A day ago, the court had dismissed another PIL seeking a CBI probe citing lack of materials to substantiate the allegation of an improper probe.

Considering the new PIL, the court has asked the state government to file an affidavit and has posted the case for a hearing on March 2. Opposite parties named in the PIL are the state government, state police chief, accountant general (general and social sector audit), comptroller and auditor general of India, and the Union government.

It is alleged in the PIL that no steps have been taken by the authorities yet to trace and recover the missing rifles and bullets. According to the PIL, the report by the CAG had mentioned a shortage of 25 5.56mm Insas rifles and 12,061 live cartridges, which includes 1,835 cartridges for Insas rifles and 1,578 cartridges for AK-47 rifles. It was also found out that out of the missing cartridges, 250 9mm drill cartridges were replaced by dummy bullets. The shortage of bullets started to happen from 2000 onwards, the petition said citing the report.

The CAG report had recommended for steps to immediately recover the missing rifles and bullets as well as taking stock of arms and ammunition of the entire police force in the state, the petitioner pointed out.

Though the crime branch team conducting the investigation at present has given a statement that no rifles are missing, there is serious suspicion regarding the actual situation, the PIL said. While the claims in the CAG report and that of the crime branch team are contradictory, the fact remains that missing of arms and ammunition is a serious security breach involving the security of the nation and the people of the state. Therefore, it is highly necessary to find out the veracity of the allegation so as to ensure physical safety of the people, the PIL stated while seeking a probe by the CBI or the NIA.

Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai. (ANI photo)

NEW DELHI: Delhi’s newly appointed environment minister, Gopal Rai , held a high-level meeting with officials of Delhi Pollution Control Committee and Delhi government’s environment and forest departments on Thursday.

The meeting was intended to impress on the officials the need to make environment a mass movement so that the promises made in Arvind Kejriwal’s pre-election ‘Guarantee Card’ could be fulfilled. These include planting two crore saplings, cleaning the Yamuna and reducing pollution levels by a third.

Track the pollution level in your city

At Thursday’s meeting, the government decided on four immediate steps. “Obtaining real-time data is the first priority,” Rai said. “For this, I will visit the office of Washington University near India Gate on Friday to understand the process of obtaining real-time data.” The second priority is sewage treatment plants created by Delhi Jal Board to detect, treat and monitor pollution in the Yamuna. “I will be visiting an STP at Delhi Gate to see its functioning,"" the minister said.

The meeting proposed a roundtable meeting on February 27, where experts, NGOs and environmentalists would discuss air pollution. There, Rai said, he would invite suggestions for Delhi government to consider when it is formulating a long-term action plan to clear the city’s air. The fourth step will be an interaction with greening agencies on February 28 to help determine how 40 lakh trees can be planted each year for five years.

“During the Delhi Assembly elections, CM Arvind Kejriwal ji had made a significant promise to reduce by one-third the pollution in Delhi and another to plant two crore trees in the city over five years,” Rai said. “To achieve this, we cannot rely solely on the government. We need the help of the people. Environment needs to be made into a mass movement in which every individual is a contributor. We will hold meetings with various departments to come up with a long-term action plan on how we can create this movement and involve the people.”

Rai said an action team needed to be formulated to oversee the effort. “In Delhi, the coordination of several agencies is important, and an action team can guide such a coordination,” he explained.

The environment minister conceded that people complied with but did not accept the rationale for the odd-even road rationing exercise because they felt that vehicular emissions was not a major component of Delhi’s air pollution. “Many felt dust and stubble-burning were the biggest contributors to dirty air,” he said. “The problem is we need real-time data to identify exactly what the biggest sources of pollution at any given time are to enable us to tackle them accordingly. Our tie-up with Washington University for real-time data will provide us a report by March this year and we can then measure our actions as well as the impact of each action.”

Rai claimed that various measures undertaken in the last five years, such as 24-hour power supply, increased greenery and the construction of the Eastern-Western Peripheral Expressway had helped Delhi. He also opined that the odd-even measure had sensitised people and impacted thinking.

But, for residents of Alaknanda Apartment, it is brutal reality that left an indelible imprint on their collective psyche.A 20-year-old man, Prashant Singh, who had come to the elite residential complex in Gomtinagar extension to invite a friend to a birthday party was fatally attacked by a group of outsiders in front of at least three security guards and several bystanders.“We are shocked at how unsafe our city has become that murders like this are happening in broad daylight. We are infuriated at the security arrangements in posh apartments like ours,” said a resident, not willing to be named. Many Alaknanda Apartment residents stayed away from the crime scene. Those who assembled near the front gate swarming with policemen and forensic experts vented their anger at private security guards.“We pay Rs 2,000 per flat monthly for maintenance and security, but the incident today has instilled fear in us. Are we safe here,” asked Anurag Anand, a dentist.Poonam Tiwari, a dietician, said, “I am shocked to know that CCTV cameras at the gate are not working. The guards didn’t even try to confront the attackers.”Durgesh Shukla, the security supervisor, said the attack happened too quickly for anyone to react. “The victim came out of SUV and ran inside, but fell before reaching the elevator.

There are 6,714 housing co-operatives in Ahmedabad

AHMEDABAD: Over the past few weeks, each time chunks of concrete fall off from the 59-year-old posh Nirmalkunj Society on the central business district (CBD) riverfront, residents — most of whom are elderly — have been hit by anxiety. In 2018, the residents had resolved to have the society redeveloped, but they have been waiting for an answer from the state government on whether a co-operative housing society is eligible for redevelopment . There are 6,714 housing co-operatives in Ahmedabad.

Officials at the registrar of co-operatives (housing) in Paldi have already communicated Nirmalkunj residents that an order or a resolution from the commissioner of co-operatives in this respect is yet to be received.

Time is running out for the eight families of the 18 members who live in Nirmalkunj. In one building, Block-C, deflection (bent) in the beam was observed, such that the building has slanted towards a slum area, adjacent to the society’s wall. Also February 2019 structural engineers report has pointed out “settlement of foundation in few blocks due to seepage.”

Town development officer for west zone, Chaitanya Shah said, “Till June last year, we have already issued Nirmalkunj Society members two notices to vacate the building immediately. If any tragedy occurs members living within the society or outside will be held responsible,” said Shah.

He added that the members have also been communicated that as per road width, only six floors will be allowed and no access will be provided from the riverfront.

Registrar of co-operatives (housing) for Ahmedabad, Chetan Parmar, said, “Re-development is allowed in housing which are under Gujarat Flat Owners Act. We cannot allow co-operative housing society permission for redevelopment as subsequent government order in this respect has not been be received by our department. Co-operatives are governed under Gujarat Co-operatives Act. It’s a different law,” says Parmar.

But state secretary for co-operation Manish Bhardwaj , said, “Redevelopment permissions are applicable to co-operative housings societies and for any new work, housing or any other kind of repairs. The society needs to have consent of 70% of the members and submit the resolution to the registrar. Housing societies can also get consent of 70% members for any change or initiating redevelopment work.''

When TOI visited the premises, the members were reluctant to comment. Recently the society’s accounts were frozen as a new committee is yet to be approved by the registrar. Chairman of the society Alka Tripathi said, “We have applied for redevelopment right now. We are yet to receive an answer from authorities. We are worried as the building is dilapidated and we have nowhere to go.”

CM Kamal Nath attended a multi-faith mass marriage ceremony in Chhindwara

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath on Thursday asked the younger generation to imbibe Indian values and culture by eliminating social evils. “It is necessary for the existence of our country,” he said while addressing a mass marriage function of all religions and physically challenged couples in Chhindwara.

The event found a place in the Golden Book of World Records with 3,353 couples married together in a single function. The CM said that the event was a symbol of India’s diverse culture where Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists and disables couples tied the knot.

Nath said India’s culture is our greatest power, which makes this a great nation in the world. He argued it is the responsibility of younger generation to ensure that this characteristic of unity among people of different religions, castes, languages with the spirit of brotherhood is maintained.

Nath said that the state has a major challenge before it to make it a leader in the field of education and health. He said quality is essential in education and without it, the future of youths will be bleak. He said there is also a need for improvement in health facilities. “In these two fields, we should move forward towards excellence. The youth will need to play an important role in this regard,” he added.

Nath also said that the state government has taken important decisions including loan waiver for economic upliftment of farmers. “Economy of the state will not strengthen if purchasing power of farmers does not increase”, he said. He mentioned that his government is working with an aim to ensure fair prices to farmers for their produce.

“We are striving to bring a new revolution in the agriculture sector,” Nath said. By reducing electricity bills, the state has taken an initiative to provide relief to general consumers, he said.

Madurai: To help the fisheries department regulating marine fishing activities, contain illegal fishing, maintain law and order problems at sea and to manage inter-sector conflicts, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami inaugurated marine enforcement wing on Wednesday.

According to a statement, the fisheries department is taking serious steps for the effective implementation of Tamil Nadu Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1983. However, inadequate infrastructure, patrolling vessels and manpower are major hurdles in maintaining the law and order situation at sea besides preventing illegal fishing and conserving resources.

The newly-created wing will have 112 posts, which include a superintendent of police, a deputy superintendent of police, and 10 inspectors. The wing will also have 19 vehicles and provisions for patrol boat. The wing will conduct regular patrolling along the coast, fishing harbours, fish landing centres and other vulnerable areas to contain banned fishing practices.

The CM, who unveiled the emblem for the wing, also affixed the newly-designed badges to police personnel who are part of the wing.

A scheme was launched by the central and state governments for the conversion of 2,000 trawling boats in the Palk Bay region into deep sea fishing boats. During 2017-18, governments had allotted Rs 286 crore for the scheme for converting 500 trawl fishing boats in the first phase. Eight such boats were constructed spending Rs 6.40 crore for fishermen in Ramanathapuram district. The CM has handed over keys of the deep sea fishing boats to seven fishermen.

The CM has also inaugurated several buildings under the Tamil Nadu Dr J Jayalalithaa Fisheries University for Rs 27.65crore at Nagapattinam, Ramanathapuram and Chengalpattu districts.

MADURAI: Family members of the Melavalavu massacre victims have moved the Madras high court challenging the premature release of the 13 convicts.

The case involves the massacre of six dalits at Melavalavu on June 30, 1997, by members of another caste following the election of a dalit as the village council president. The state government released all the 13 convicts citing good conduct in November 2019.

Five women – Manimegala, Vasanthi, Kaali, Pachaiyammal and Kattachi – who are family members of the deceased moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to quash the orders passed by the state government for the premature release of these convicts and sought to detain them back in prison.

When the case was taken up for hearing on Thursday, justice A D Jagadish Chandira tagged this petition to be heard along with similar petitions which were filed earlier.

It maybe recalled that, recently, while hearing two petitions with similar prayers, a division bench withdrew the interim order which directed all the convicts to stay in Vellore district after the litigant who challenged the release of 13 life convicts in Melavalavu massacre case failed to appear before the court for the hearing.

HYDERABAD: Teenagers who have undiagnosed heart diseases can have sudden heart attacks, but many lives can be saved by cardiopulmonary resuscitation , said experts.Four days after 18-year-old Intermediate student, Lavudya Sathish, died of suspected heart attack, when he was confronted by DMart staff in Vanasthalipuram for stealing chocolates, health experts said Satish’s life may have been saved if someone knew CPR at the mall.“When there is a death due to cardiac arrest, the heart is generally to blame. But even more to blame is the fact that we don’t have enough experts to handle emergencies with CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which can possibly save a life in such circumstances,” said Dr Sivaranjani Santosh , a leading paediatrician who works extensively on CPR and administering first-aid.Experts say hypertrophied cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in youngsters.“In HCM, the heart muscle thickens abnormally, and this can make it harder for the heart to pump blood. This is also a genetic disease. HCM can trigger arrhythmia, which can be described as irregular heartbeat, which in turn leads to sudden cardiac death,” said Dr Sai Ravi Shankar, senior consultant interventional cardiologist, Continental Hospitals.According to available statistical data, awareness of CPR in the Indian population is less than 1%. Calling for more awareness on CPR and the importance of going for regular health check-ups involving ECG and echo tests, Dr Shankar said that there are 100% chances of survival in cases of arrhythmia if CPR is performed immediately, in the right way. “It is extremely crucial to have some knowledge of handling medical emergencies. Also, families that have a history of SCD must go for heart screenings to prevent such incidents from occurring. In last two years, I have witnessed nearly 6 SCD cases among youngsters, ” adding, “Unlike the US, UK and Canada, where training is imparted in schools, colleges and communities, we have still not incorporated training in life support in our curriculum,” he said.Dr Vijay Rao, faculty member of American Health Association for basic life support, said that in Sathish’s case, the death was most likely a result of shock, which caused a surge in release of catecholamines (neurotransmitters), which causes more dangerous arrhythmia that leads to cardiac arrest and, if untreated, sudden death. “Had CPR been performed on the boy in the first five minutes, chances of him surviving would have increased. Every 90 seconds, there is death due to cardiac arrest, which is more than deaths due to all the cancers,” he said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74239731,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-324908,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cpr-couldve-saved-dmart-victim-experts/articleshow/74232930.cms

NEW DELHI: While the talk till now has been about the commuting woes due to the blockade of the Kalindi Kunj road by protesters at Shaheen Bagh , the new dispute is about the barricades placed on the stretch there to stop vehicles from using the roads in the area.At a time when the DND Flyway, the major point of entry into Delhi from Noida, is choked, barricades (B1) placed on the six-lane Okhla Barrage Road at a point where the Mahamaya Flyover descends appears misdirected. However, they actually prevent chaos on the two smaller roads flanking Madanpur Khadar, as do the barricades (B2) manned by Uttar Pradesh Police near the new Kalindi Kunj bridge.The 150-metre protest site at Shaheen Bagh comprises tents on one carriageway of GD Birla Road, protest installations and uprooted grills on the other. Between Jasola at one end and Kalindi Kunj park on the other, the 900 metres has a series of barricades (B3, B4, B5), those closest to the sit-in side manned by protesters and those at the extreme ends by police.The placement of police barricades (B2) near the Supertech Supernova building at a fair distance from Shaheen Bagh has received flak. But what this achieves is visible 1.5km down the stretch. Dinesh Kumar, a traffic policeman at the barricade, described such criticism as “specious”. He asked, “Why would we want to close the roads simply to inconvenience people? Is it not clear that if we remove the barricades, with the main carriageways blocked, the two smaller Khadar Road and Mithapur-Molarband Road will not be able to take the traffic load?”Another officer caustically observed, ""The removal of these barricade will induce a heart attack in the arterial road network several kilometres away.” When TOI visited the barricades on Thursday, police were allowing smaller vehicles to run via the sector road, but even this small trickle was creating significant chaos further down.After crossing the Kalindi Kunj bridge, commuters encounter barricades (B3) handled by CRPF and Delhi Police at the right turn toward Atlantic Water World park. “We allow ambulances and school buses through because the next barricade on GD Birla Marg is managed by the protesters, who let them pass too,” a CRPF personnel said. The protestors do not permit other vehicles, either here or on the road from Kalindi Kunj to Abul Fazal Enclave and Okhla Bird Sanctuary.Executives of the private toll collector at Kalindi Kunj have been idling since the protest began over two months ago. More than 1.5 lakh vehicles crossed the border every day. One of them recalled how for the first couple of days there were jams for up to 10 hours until the barricades stopped the entry of vehicles from Noida. “There is no way the smaller roads in the area can handle such a volume,” he noted.TOI realised on Thursday that even the limited number of vehicles being allowed to reach the toll point were causing chaos on the two-lane Khadar Road and Mithapur-Molarband Road branching off from the Kalindi Kunj bridge. The latter has a small bridge where traffic bunches up. Pradeep Chauhan, a contractor who uses the road every day, grumbled about being stuck there for up to an hour. “It takes me five minutes on normal days, but traffic has burgeoned,” he said. Mohammed Illyas, a broom seller who rides a two-wheeler, had a dire warning: “This bridge can collapse any day.”At Shaheen Bagh, it has been suggested that one carriageway could be opened for traffic while the sit-in continues on the other. Police, however, are sceptical about the half-road solution. An officer explained that the purpose of blocking both carriageways was to ensure the safety of the protesters. “Heavy commercial vehicles cross the UP border and they are bound to cause chaos among the floating population congregating at the protest site,” he said, adding that there was also the risk of “violent elements” approaching the protest site in large numbers if traffic was allowed on the road. “Who will be accountable for any law and order problem that could arise if such mischief makers managed to access the protest site?” he asked.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74234294,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-215198,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shaheen-bagh-road-closure-cops-have-their-reasons/articleshow/74232949.cms

THRISSUR: The tragic bus accident at Avinashi in Tamil Nadu on Thursday morning also shattered the dreams of many families in the district.

Anu K V, 24, wife of Snijo, a resident of Vazhappally near Erumappetty , was coming home from Bengaluru, where she was working, to meet her husband who was planning to go back to Qatar. “The couple had got married only a month ago. Snijo, who works in Qatar, was going back on Sunday. Anu was coming to meet him. It’s a big loss to our family,” Johnson, Anu’s relative, said.

For another victim, Jofi Paul, it was his long-pending dream of visiting the Velankanni shrine with family, that has gone unfulfilled. Jofi’s colleagues at Joy Alukkas in Bengaluru, where he is the manager, remember him as a man with ever-smiling face. “Jofi was always identified by his iconic smile. He had taken leave from work to visit Velankanni Church with family,” his colleague Anish said.

Another victim from Thrissur , Igni Raphel, 39, a resident of Ollur, was working at an oil rig in Saudi for several years. He had come home to take his wife to Saudi. “Raphel had decided to arrange a job to wife Bincy in Saudi. As part of this, the couple had gone to Bengaluru to collect Bincy’s college certificate. The couple, who got married four years ago, was planing to complete the paper works after collecting the certificates. But the accident destroyed all their hopes,” said a relative of the family.

For Manikandan, his 25-year-old son Kuranjiyoor Valappil Haneesh was everything. A resident of Chittilappally near Thrissur, Haneesh had got married on October 25, 2019, and he was the sole bread winner of his family. He had completed his polytechnic course and was working in an engineering firm in Bengaluru. The family was staying in a rented premises at Adat and Chittilappilli areas for several years. With the death of their sole breadwinner, Manikandan, has no answers about his family’s future.

175,['21/02/2020'],Payal Tadvi suicide case: Bombay HC asks B Y L Nair Hospital dean if accused doctors on bail can do PG,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Payal Tadvi

MUMBAI: Six months after they were released on bail in the Dr Payal Tadvi suicide case , the Bombay high court has sought B Y L Nair Hospital dean’s assistance to figure whether the three accused doctors can pursue their post-graduation in a different unit there. The HC directed the hospital’s gynaecology head to remain present on Friday to enable it to pass orders.

Last October, the accused doctor trio—Hema Ahuja, Bhakti Mehare and Ankita Khandelwal— had approached the HC to drop certain strict bail conditions and be permitted to enter Nair college and practise again.

On Wednesday, at a hearing of their plea before Justice Sadhana Jadhav, Aabad Ponda, senior counsel for the doctors, submitted that their right to complete their post-graduation from the same college be protected. Senior counsel Raja Thakare appearing as special public prosecutor, though, said while relaxing the bail conditions, the court must also keep in mind that witnesses in the case work in the same college. They would all be working together and, therefore, the remotest possibility of tampering of witnesses will have to be ruled out first, it was submitted.

The accused are pursuing post-graduation in gynaecology. The prosecution said it would ask the college if they can pursue their PG in a unit different than the one they were attached to before the FIR was registered against them. The gynaecology department head will give appropriate instructions to the dean and the prosecution, said the HC.

The dean, too, will assist the prosecution, said the judge and posted the matter to Friday for orders. Barun Kumar, counsel for the complainant, objected to any relaxation in bail conditions, arguing that tampering of witnesses cannot be ruled out.

Tadvi, a junior doctor pursuing her PG at Nair College, ended her life on May 22. Her family alleged the accused doctors taunted her and hurled casteist abuses at her. Police filed a chargesheet against the trio for abetment to suicide and under the SC/ST Act. They were in judicial custody for over two months.

In an oral observation, the judge, “The social impact of the case was so much that they (accused) should not face wrath. From whatever they have done, we cannot take away their right to education.”

Representative Image

LUCKNOW: For all patient needs under neuro science, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) will soon be the one-stop medical centre. The institute is setting up the state’s first advanced neuro science centre. It is also going to be the first institute in the state to have the gamma knife procedure for burning out brain tumours without opening up a patient’s head.

The two decisions were taken by the institute on Thursday in its 32nd general body meeting presided over by principal secretary medical education Dr Rajneesh Dubey.

The centre will provide neuro trauma and neuro emergency treatment under a single roof at the centre. In the first phase, 90 beds and three modular operation theatres will be constructed on three floors of the institute’s new block. By bringing gamma knife procedure to the state, RMLIMS will make complex brain tumour surgeries more likely to be successful. Under this procedure, gamma rays will be used to burn the tumour without cutting through the head. Even complex tumours really close to brain nerves can be burnt with the gamma knife.

The facility, the institute said in a statement, will allow discharge of a patient from the hospital within four hours of surgery, unlike weeks of stay after regular brain tumour surgeries.

With the procedure, RMLIMS expects to treat around 1,000 patients every year for not just brain tumour but other diseases like acoustic neuroma, vascular malformation and epilepsy.

177,['21/02/2020'],"I am committed to change the face of MP, says CM","This story is from February 21, 2020

Chief minister Kamal Nath has said that when he took over the reins of Madhya Pradesh, he could realise that the state was stuck in an economic mess due to “unwise” financial policies of the Union government and the previous BJP government in MP.

In a blog on Thursday, the CM said, “Huge resources were spent to project just one person and fake propaganda was carried out to keep him in focus at an expenditure of crores, but no attention was paid towards “inclusive” development of MP, which kept sliding during the previous regime. Several schemes were announced without allocating necessary funds for them in the budget, and this too is weighing heavily on the finances available with the incumbent Congress government in the state”.

He said, “Mahatma Gandhi had said that whenever a government formulates a scheme, its focus should be the last man in the queue and whenever it has to evaluate its performance, it should look at the condition of villages and farmers”. The chief minister said he is happy that his government has been able to do what Gandhiji wanted. “Electricity bills of 87% power consumers has come down by 50-60% following implementation of the Indira Grih Jyoti Yojana and farmers are happy as their farm debts are being waived. We are realizing Mahatma Gandhi’s dream with many such schemes”, he said.

He said that there is a special reason why he wants to interact with people of the state through his blog. “The recent Union budget clearly indicates that “immature” economic decisions of the Union government have put the nation in a grim economic situation and Madhya Pradesh is also suffering on this count. There has been a drop in GDP growth rate as the Union government is neglecting inclusive growth of the nation. With huge unemployment among youths and fall in net tax revenue collection, the country is heading towards serious economic condition”, he said.

The chief minister said that he is also concerned over “back-stabbing” by the Union government, which is not giving its share for the schemes being implemented in MP. Even in “Swachh Bharat Mission” (urban), the Union government has given only 20% of its share, he said.

“The Union government, in its revised estimate, has reduced the share of MP by Rs 14,233 crore. It is for the first time in 50 years that the state’s share in central taxes has been so low. People of MP have elected 28 BJP MPs, but no one raises his voice in the interest of the state,” Nath said.

The chief minister, however, said that he is committed to change every social and economic challenges into an opportunity and nobody can stop Madhya Pradesh from becoming one of the most developed states of the country.

COIMBATORE/KOCHI: Kerala woke up on Thursday to the tragedy of a horrific road crash, involving a state transport (KSRTC) bus and a floor tiles-laden container truck near Avinashi on Tirupur-Salem bypass in Tamil Nadu around 3.40am, that claimed the lives of 19 people and left 25 injured. The deceased included five women and the two driver-cum-conductors of the multi-axle luxury bus.

The bus was going to Ernakulam from Bengaluru with 48 passengers. The container truck, laden with over 25 tonnes of floor tiles, was heading towards Bengaluru from Kochi. Police said the truck driver, K A Hemaraj (37), might have fallen asleep at the wheel and lost control of the vehicle. The speeding truck hit the 15-cm high median, entered the other side of the lane and rammed the bus head-on.

The right side of the bus was completely torn off till near its middle. Most passengers sitting on the left side of the bus were stuck inside for hours as the front portion was completely mangled. Rescue works lasted till around 8.30am.

The post-mortem of bodies was conducted at Tirupur government hospital before handing them over to relatives while the injured were rushed to nearby hospitals.

Tirupur city police commissioner Sanjay Kumar said that the truck driver had been arrested and booked under IPC sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304A (causing death by negligence).

“The autopsy of 18 persons was completed by evening and the bodies handed over to relatives. All of them are Keralites. The remaining is that of a Thumkoor native. The condition of one of the injured, Bincy, is a bit serious, for whom medical care is being given,” Kerala transport minister A K Saseendran said.

The Kerala state government will bear the treatment expenses of the injured.

Lucknow: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on principal secretary, forests, for default on framing of UP Special Tiger Protection Service Rules and for keeping the court waiting for hearing.

A bench of Justice MN Bhandari and Justice Manish Kumar passed the order on a pending PIL moved in 2016 for protection of tigers. A tiger protection force was constituted way back in 2013 but the rules have not been framed till date.

On January 7, the court had directed the officials to frame the rules or else the principal secretary (forest) and chief conservator of forests/field director of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (Kheri) would have to appear before it on February 17.

On the day of hearing, the chief conservator appeared and said the rules could not be framed.

The principal secretary (forest), however, was busy in the assembly session, his counsel said.

While the court was about to issue a contempt notice, the counsel said the secretary was on his way.

The court granted half an hour to the secretary while imposing fine of Rs 25,000 for wasting its time.

The secretary informed the court that the process of framing rules was taking time due to other departments and sought three months for completion, which the court granted.

MADURAI/TRICHY: Japanese health authorities on Thursday started collecting swabs from the crew members of the ship Diamond Princess which has been quarantined off Yokohama due to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which infected them. Meanwhile, an assurance given by Trichy district collector S Sivarasu to one of the Indian crew members on board the ship that they will be airlifted on a special plane in a day or two has given a new lease of life to the worried men.“As the quarantine period for passengers came to end on Wednesday, hundreds of them were evacuated over the last two days. Swabs were collected from us on Thursday and we were told that the results will be known in two to three days. The captain also made an announcement that a Philippines crew member who had earlier tested positive for COVID-19 has recovered and returned home,” Anbalagan, a crew member from Madurai, told TOI.Devipriya, the wife of Muthu Ponnusamy, 42, of Trichy, who is among the five crew members from Tamil Nadu on the ship, petitioned the Trichy collector on Thursday. She appealed to the government through him to bring back the Indians including her husband who are on the quarantined ship. The chef who is a colleague of Anbalagan used to come home once in six months.“My wife is a homemaker. My son and daughter are in class VI and V. They are worried over the undue delay in evacuating us from the ship. So she petitioned the collector. I spoke to the collector on a WhatsApp call through my wife’s phone and explained our plight. We want to be disembarked from the infected ship on priority,” Muthu said. The collector told his wife and the crew over phone that he is aware of the issue and also enquired about his health. “I spoke with him. He tested negative. He and other Indians are likely to be airlifted from the ship tomorrow,” the collector told TOI.Meanwhile, the Indian Embassy in Tokyo stated that one Indian crew member is among the 79 new cases who had tested positive for COVID-19 on board Diamond Princess on Wednesday. In their tweet on Thursday, the embassy added that this takes the number of Indians on board who tested positive for COVID-19 to eight. Stating that they have been shifted to a hospital for treatment, it added that all eight Indians receiving treatment are responding well. “All other Indians on board are braving out the trying circumstances,” it added.

Rescue operation in full flow early on Thursday

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With proper insurance coverage and revised policy, KSRTC will be able to offer a decent sum as insurance amount to the families of the Avinashi accident victims. An amount of Rs 10 lakh each will be paid to the relatives, said transport minister A K Saseendran.

KSRTC CMD M P Dinesh convened a meeting with representatives of New India Assurance company on Thursday to expedite the disbursal of insurance amount.

Saseendran said it is the first time that KSRTC will be disbursing such a huge amount of insurance to the kin of accident victims. “A first instalment amount of Rs 2 lakh each will be disbursed to the relatives on an urgent basis without procedural delay. The remaining amount will be paid in a month. Families of the bus crew members who died in the accident will be given an amount of Rs 30 lakh as insurance amount.

“The treatment expenses of the injured will be paid by KSRTC from passenger insurance. Overcoming several challenges, introducing passenger insurance cess and regular payment of premium amount led KSRTC to pay the insurance,” the minister said.

Also, financial aid up to Rs 3 lakh will be provided to people injured in the accident.

The insurance policy was revised by KSRTC last year, when an employee P Prakash died for burn injuries sustained during an accident involving KSRTC bus and concrete mixer vehicle at Vayakkal , near Ayoor. The insurance amount was found to be insufficient to meet the treatment expenses of the person. Then, KSRTC came into an agreement with New India Assurance company for insurance coverage for passengers.

The minister also said KSRTC will conduct an inquiry into the accident in which 19 people were killed and more than 20 people were grievously injured at Avinashi, Tamil Nadu . “I have ordered an inquiry. And KSRTC managing director will probe and submit a report,” said Saseendran.

Ramesh Chennithala

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has demanded that the report of additional chief secretary (home and vigilance) Vishwas Mehta , giving clean chit to the police, should be immediately discarded as the crime branch has already seized fake cartridge shells from special armed police battalion.

“After the crime branch seized fake cartridge shells, the report of the home secretary itself has become a sham. The report is only an attempt to rescue the government from the crisis it has fallen into, and the report is nothing but tailor-made for how the chief minister asked him to write such a report,” Chennithala said. He said that the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) had sought explanation from the home department over the irregularities in the purchases and missing guns and cartridges before finalising the audit report. The home secretary’s report is the same justification that CAG had examined earlier and discarded after finding them baseless.

The home secretary is also responsible for the findings of the CAG’s report. It is strange that the same person who is one of the culprits is preparing a report that has now given clean chit to all the irregularities, Chennithala said.

A report by Mehta, on the adverse remarks on the police, had given clean chit to the police, completely brushing away the observations of the CAG. The home secretary had given explanation on each of the major observations of the CAG report.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Intense lobbying at different levels is on to raise the retirement age of medical college doctors since about 60 doctors are due for retirement this April-end.

The retirement age of doctors was increased to 62 from 60 in 2017 when a bunch of senior doctors were due for retirement that year. Now the same set of doctors will be retiring this April. Hence, they have again started lobbying for raising the retirement age to 65 from 62. The retirement of medical college doctors takes place only at the end of the academic year.

According to sources, the proposal for increasing the retirement age along with pay revision is awaiting approval at the chief minister’s office.

However, this proposal has been vehemently opposed by the finance department. “There is no need for increasing the retirement age presently. It was raised two years ago. Moreover, it would affect prospects of several junior doctors,” said a senior finance department official. The health department has also taken a similar stand on the issue. But now the doctors have approached the chief minister’s office with the request.

The Kerala Government Medical College Teachers Association (KGMCTA) is also against raising the retirement age. But the doctors who are due for retirement this year are lobbying citing that the cream of senior doctors will be leaving the medical education service with this retirement.

“We have not demanded the increase in the retirement age since it would affect the prospects of the several junior colleagues and also those who are in the list seeking recruitment to the medical education service. The only demand of the association was to implement the pay revision since the last revision was done in 2006,” said Dr Nirmal Bhaskar, state secretary of KGMCTA.

When P K Sreemathi was the health minister in the V S Achuthanandan government, the pay revision was implemented in 2006. The retirement age of the medical college doctors was increased to 60 from 55 in 2009.

Bhopal: Undersecretary in the ministry of home affairs (MHA), M K Chahar, appeared in the court of judicial magistrate first-class Hiralal Alawa in Bhopal on Thursday to explain the delay in delivery of court summons to Dow Chemical at its headquarters in USA.

Alawa, however, refused to hear the case any further in compliance with a notification that all cases pending in the court of magistrates, where CBI is the prosecuting agency, will be heard by the court of additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM). The case now stands transferred to the court of ACJM Ashish Parsai, the applicant was told.

The court has issued summons to be delivered to Dow Chemical half a dozen times in response to an application filed by the NGO Bhopal Group for Information & Action (BGIA), seeking a reply on why Dow should not be made a party in the litigation against Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) and its officials for the Bhopal gas disaster since it took over UCC in 2001. BGIA, which was one of the interveners in the criminal proceedings against UCC, its subsidiaries and officials, contends that Dow Chemical, by taking over UCC, not only inherited its assets but also its liabilities and therefore, it should also face trial for the Bhopal gas disaster, which killed hundreds of people and maimed many more.

BGIA co-convener Rachna Dhingra prayed to the judge, Ashish Parsai, to hear the case on Wednesday itself since the MHA undersecretary was present in court in compliance with a court order, but the judge said he needed time to examine the case. The court has posted the case for February 26.

MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray will be in New Delhi on Friday to meet PM Narendra Modi and Congress president Sonia Gandhi , even as Congress and NCP appear to have further piled on pressure on the Shiv Sena to reject the National Population Register, which the Sena is in favour of implementing.A senior Congress minister told TOI that CAA, NRC and NPR may figure in the meeting between Thackeray and Sonia given the divide in the Maha Vikas Aghadi over the issues. Both Congress and NCP want the MVA to take the position adopted by non-BJP states, and state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat reiterated on Thursday that his party would urge Thackeray to reconsider the Sena’s stand that NPR updation—set to begin in the state from May 1— was in the national interest.This will be Uddhav’s first meeting with Sonia after becoming CM. His son Aaditya had met her in Delhi to invite her for his swearing-in ceremony in November 2019, but she did not attend. Aaditya will accompany Uddhav on Friday as minister for tourism and protocol.Sena MP and parliamentary party leader Sanjay Raut tweeted that the meeting with the PM would be a “courtesy call,” though Uddhav and Modi had met at a police conference in Pune soon after the former was sworn in as CM. Raut stated, “There is no need to dig further, Jai Maharashtra .” However, sources said issues such as streamlining of payment of Maharashtra’s GST share and topics such as CAA-NRC-NPR may also be discussed.Sources said Thackeray may congratulate Modi for announcing formation of a trust to construct the Ram mandir in Ayodhya. Uddhav had been pushing for the temple as part of the NDA before BJP and Sena ended their alliance after the state poll results. Even after he became CM, Uddhav said he would visit Ayodhya on March 7.The Sena president had last year gone to Varanasi when PM Modi had filed his nomination papers for the April-May Lok Sabha elections, and Uddhav was in Gandhinagar as well to accompany then BJP chief Amit Shah for filing of his papers.In a recent interview to Sena mouthpiece Saamna, Uddhav had said, when asked if he would go to Delhi, “It is not mandatory to visit Delhi, but I do not hate Delhi. Whenever required, I will visit.”Asked if he would meet PM Modi and Sonia Gandhi, he had said, “Why I should not meet them? Will meet Modi, Soniaji, (LK) Advani.”A Sena leader said chief ministers have to maintain a good rapport with the Centre for funds to be released smoothly and on time and for coordination on various issues.On the even of Uddhav’s visit, NCP spokesperson and state minister Nawab Malik again spoke out against the NPR and said the MVA must examine the response of non-BJP states before taking a final stand on the matter. “Besides Congress-ruled Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, several other non-BJP states too have opposed NPR,” Malik said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74235354,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-220876,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/uddhav-to-meet-sonia-as-cong-ncp-firm-on-not-allowing-npr/articleshow/74233754.cms

For them, it was the usual journey home. Their bus left Bengaluru at night and all of them were fast asleep when a container truck collided with their KSRTC bus near Avinashi around 3.30am. The truck’s container unit almost ripped out the right side of the bus even before the passengers could sense what was happening and it was over within seconds.

Sreelakshmi Menon (25) from Thrissur, who works as a manager at Flipkart in Bengaluru, said most passengers were fast asleep when the mishap occurred. “The bus left Bengaluru around 9pm. My seat was on the left side and I remember waking up on hearing a loud noise around 3.30am. I saw that some passengers, including kids, fall inside the bus and the road. For me, it was a miraculous escape,” she said.

“I managed to get out of the bus and saw that a major portion was destroyed on the other side. Visibility was low in the area. An ambulance reached the spot and we were shifted to nearby Revathi Medical Centre. After being kept under observation for some time in the hospital, I was allowed to go home,” she said.

Chirakkekkara Christo Francis (25) and his two colleagues escaped with minor injuries. Christo, who works at SFO Technologies in Kakkanad, injured his right leg. “Christo and his colleagues visited Bengaluru for official purpose. They were supposed to take a train home. But train was cancelled and they chose the bus. The trio were sleeping in the backseats when the accident happened. Christo’s leg injury is a minor fracture, he was taken to a private hospital for treatment. He is on his way home,” said Christo’s father Francis.

Another passenger Madhusoodhana Varma, who spoke over the phone from Deepa Hospital at Tirupur, is yet to overcome the shock. Varma, a techie settled in Bengaluru, was on his way to meet his father in Thrissur. Varma said he woke up on hearing a loud noise. He was sitting on the left side of the bus and his legs were stuck between seats and his right arm was fractured. Varma was stuck for 90 minutes, until rescue workers managed to get him out.

His cousin had reached the hospital in Tirupur on hearing about the accident. Varma, after treating his fractured hand and leg wounds, returned to Thrissur with his cousin in the afternoon in a car. He is planning to continue treatment at a private hospital in Thrissur and his family is expected to arrive here soon.

Design engineer Santhosh Kumar, who travels every week from Bengaluru to Palakkad, felt he was lucky to escape with minor injuries. “I have a cut on my lips and some bruises on my legs. The person beside me fractured his leg. Residents rushed to help us. I remember flames and fumes rising from the bus. Within a short time, fire and rescue personnel came to our rescue. I was taken to a hospital,” he said.

LUCKNOW: Considering a patient’s request in a transplant case, the high court on Wednesday allowed a man to donate his liver to a woman suffering from liver cirrhosis.

The petitioner had challenged the order passed by the State Authorization Committee of February 9, 2020, and an order passed by district authorization committee on December 23, 2019. These committees approve live organ transplants based on a number of factors and also help check illegal transplants motivated by commercial dealings.

These authorities had rejected the woman’s application saying the donor was not a close relative of the recipient and that there was disparity in their financial status. Satisfied that the consent for donation was bonafide, the court set aside reports of the authorities and directed doctors to take care of the donor during hospitalization and in recovery.

A bench of Justice MN Bhandari and Justice Manish Kumar passed the order on a writ petition moved by the woman patient.

Taking into consideration that the donor was known to the patient from childhood and frequently visited her house, the court called him in court and questioned him.

The court also noted that there was no evidence of any commercial dealing between the patient and the donor.

NEW DELHI: In a month, Delhi will start getting detailed reports on the composition and contribution of different sources of air pollution, Delhi’s environment minister Gopal Rai said on Thursday.The real-time source apportionment set-up, which has been installed by Delhi government in association with Washington University , is likely to be functional soon, and its first report will be presented by March, Rai said.Track the pollution level in your cityThe newly-appointed minister said he would be visiting the headquarters of Washington University in Delhi near Major Dhyanchand stadium on Friday to meet the scientists and understand how the data could be utilised. “We had a number of studies on source-apportionment carried out in the past, but these are old studies now. A lot has changed in Delhi since. Not only do we need to know the highest source of pollution, but also how this changes every few months,” said Rai.Meanwhile, DPCC officials said the project would be able to provide an accurate data on the contribution of each sector in both summer and winter, allowing them to act on the sources of pollution. “The real-time data is important to see the improvement in each sector. If the contribution from the transport sector will be high, we can aim at reducing congestion on roads. If it is from industries, our teams can specifically target them and check for clean fuel usage,” said a DPCC official.While the first report will be made available in March, DPCC officials said a decision was yet to be taken on how often the subsequent reports would be released. “We have organised several meetings over the past few months. After the final calibration, data will be available from April. It will also be provided to our teams for further action,” added the official.The real-time source apportionment will be done using analysers installed at one location initially. Particulate matter will be taken into consideration from 26 air quality monitoring stations. Real-time monitoring and sampling of PM1, 2.5 and 10 will be carried out in addition to the various aerosols and compounds, the official said. As part of the study, an algorithm is also being developed to help DPCC analyse long-term data, he added.In January 2019, the government had signed an MoU with the Washington University to determine real-time sources of pollution through the year.

KANPUR: Two lovers, who were about to get married on Wednesday, allegedly attempted suicide by consuming poison, police said.

The man tried to end life on Tuesday after which the woman also consumed poison on Thursday evening.

Police said they were yet to ascertain why the couple took the extreme step.

They both are undergoing treatment at LLR hospital where their condition is stated to be critical.

Both of them were found unconscious in their respective houses.

According to police, the 23-year-old woman of Harsh Nagar locality, and 25-year-old man of Kamla Tower were having an affair. “The two came in contact through Facebook and developed an affair. Thereafter, they decided to get married and apprised their parents about their decision,” a police officer said.

Subsequently, the two got engaged in April last year. Later, when the youth and his family members allegedly demanded dowry, the girl’s family lodged an FIR against the youth and his family following which the marriage was called off. However, following intervention of elders from both the sides, the matter was solved and the two sides decided to solemnise the marriage in court on February 19.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A team from special cell of the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau on Thursday conducted raids at the residence of former health and devaswom minister V S Sivakumar and his close associates in the capital. The action is in connection with the probe into allegations of amassment of disproportionate assets . The vigilance team conducted raids at the residence of Sivakumar and N S Harikumar who has been named the seventh accused in the first information report. The raids began at 8am.

The government had given sanction to the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau to register a case against Sivakumar and his close associates, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry conducted earlier. Following the government giving permission, the vigilance had registered a case against Sivakumar and three of his close associates –– M Rajendran, H Shyjuharan and N S Harikumar.

Even though the vigilance inquiry could not prove that Sivakumar amassed assets disproportionate to the known source of income during his tenure as health and devaswom minister in the former UDF ministry from May 18, 2011 to May 20, 2016, the assets of his three aides were found to have grown during the period. This, vigilance suspects, is because they acted as Sivakumar’s benamis.

Upon interrogating them, they could not give satisfactory explanations regarding the increase in wealth, the vigilance FIR said.

“The suspects 5 to 7 (the three other accused other than Sivakumar) had acquired huge assents disproportionate to their known sources of income. Since they are close associates of Sivakumar, it has to be rightly presumed that V S Sivakumar had acquired those assets possessed by them, as benami to him,” the FIR statement said.

The vigilance charged case against Sivakumar and others under Sections 13 (2) read with Section 13 (1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, and Section 120 of IPC. As per Section 13 (2), any public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine. Section 13 (1) (d) says that a public servant is said to have committed criminal offence if he makes pecuniary advantage by corrupt means and by way of using his position while holding a public office. The FIR was submitted to the vigilance court here on Tuesday.

NMC has already started a series of anti-encroachment demolition drived in all the six divisions of the municipal corporation — Nashik East, Nashik West, Nashik Road, Panchavati, Satpur and Cidco — over the past few months after instructions from civic chief Radhakrishna Game.

The NMC has warned people, including hawkers and vegetable vendors, to refrain from encroaching footpaths, roads and squares in the city. It is an inconvenience for the pedestrians and motorists.

NMC has cautioned that it would continue to take action against encroachments along the city roads and footpath.

MADURAI: Sewage water has been overflowing from manholes on the Vaigai river Bank Road in Alwarpuram for the last two days. As a result, commuters have been finding it very difficult to use the road as it is inundated with water. Residents said they have taken the issue to the notice of the Madurai corporation several times, but to no avail.

“The force of the flowing water is more during the day time, especially mornings, and apart from having to wade through it, we also get splashed by this stinky water when vehicles pass with speed on this road,” said Shenbagaraman a resident.

School children, who use the road, also suffer as they have slipped and fallen at times on the slimy road. “This seems to be a never-ending problem as we have a history of seeking solution for this same problem for many years, but we never get permanent relief,” said Abudahir of Sellur, who uses this road regularly.

The same problem persists in the Southern Bank Road also where the beautification works have been taken up by the corporation under the Smart City project. Even after the workers fix the manhole, water starts gushing out within two days of repair work, the residents said. Ismailpuram near the southern bank of Vaigai river has water overflowing from four manholes.

It is the stench that is really unbearable and the water has started running over a wide stretch and entering the river once again polluting it, said Pandian of Alwarpuram. “We also suspect that sewage from the government Rajaji hospital also overflows from this manhole, which is why it is so smelly,” said Thangaraj T, another resident.

Now, the corporation is constructing a sewage treatment plant near the Meenakshi Government Arts College and the residents said that the civic body should come forward to explain if it is going to help them.

Corporation commissioner S Visakan said that a block at the other end of the underground drainage (UGD) system was the reason behind these manholes overflowing. “It is also due to overloading and I have asked my personnel to clean it and set it right,” he said.

Bhopal: The Madhya Pradesh government will table a proposal against CAA, NRC and NPR and in the upcoming budget session of assembly, said Congress Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh said in Gwalior on Thursday.

Taking part in an anti-CAA protest, he said: “I had a talk with chief minister Kamal Nath about it and the proposal against CAA, NPR and NRC will come up in the assembly session for clearance. The Congress working committee opposes CAA, NPR and NRC nationwide. The MP cabinet has already passed a resolution against CAA. Now, it will be tabled in the assembly.”

Questions that were not part of NPR-2010 have been included in it now, Singh said. “Questions on the birthplace and birth date of parents figure on the NPR form now, and those who fail to provide these details will be considered as doubtful citizens,” the former CM said.

Replying to a question on notices being sent to people in Hyderabad for allegedly obtaining Aadhaar numbers on false documentation, Singh expressed the fear that Muslims will be “sent to detention centres in the future”. “This is going to affect India's 130-crore population. The NDA government has brought about CAA, NPR and NRC to divert people’s attention from the deteriorating economic condition,” he added.

MALAPPURAM: District administration of Malappuram has stepped in to find the medical reasons behind the deaths of six children of a family in a span of nine years at Tirur , in the backdrop of revelations that hereditary disease caused the infant deaths .

The district medical administration which has examined the medical documents regarding the babies who died during between 2011 and February 2020, has decided to demand the state government to appoint an expert medical team for a detailed study on the phenomenon. The medical administration received the forensic test results of the body samples of 3-month-old baby who died on Tuesday morning.

On Tuesday, Tirur police registered a suo motu case for the death of children, after residents raised suspicion over the death of six children, four girls and two boys, of Rafeeque and Sabna, natives of Chembra near Tirur. Police had exhumed the body of the 3-month-old baby who died on Tuesday morning and postmortem examination was conducted. But the preliminary postmortem reports had ruled out any ‘unnatural’ elements in the death of the baby. Later, doctors who treated the children, had raised doubts of genetic disorder sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) causing deaths of the children.

A senior official of medical department said that the district administration had collected details of each child’s death from the family earlier as part of data collection for infant deaths across the district. The administration has now examined them in detail once again in the backdrop of the latest incidents, including police probe into the death of the 3-month-old.

MADURAI: A fisherman from Rameswaram allegedly sustained an eye injury when the Sri Lankan navy attacked their fishing boat near the IMBL late on Wednesday. The fisherman, identified as Jesu Alangaram has been admitted to the Aravind Eye Hospitals in Madurai on Thursday.

President of the Rameswaram Fishermen ’s Co-operative, N Devadoss, said that about 500 mechanised boats had been fishing near the IMBL on Wednesday night, when a Sri Lankan naval vessel which came there started shooting indiscriminately at the boats with rubber pellets. One of the fibre boats was badly damaged and Alangaram, who was in one of the boats, sustained injury in the eye and cheek, when the splinters from the shattered glass in the boat hit him.

His fellow fishermen brought him back to the shore and he was first rushed to the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai, and later referred to the Aravind Eye Hospital. Sources from the hospital said the fisherman had suffered a corneal tear which was sutured and it was suspected that a foreign body may have entered his retina in the impact and it would be removed in a surgery soon. Devadoss said the incident is proof that the Sri Lankan navy was not going to stop antagonising the innocent fishermen. “Union minister of state for shipping, Mansukh Mandaviya had said the Indian fishermen were safe under BJP rule, but this incident proves otherwise,” he said.

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh seems to have failed when it comes to tackling ragging on campus. According to the UGC anti-ragging helpline data, MP stood second in the country in ragging complaints filed in 2019. Uttar Pradesh tops the list. Also, in 2019 , the highest number of ragging complaints in the past one decade were registered in Madhya Pradesh.The data revealed that 132 ragging complaints were filed in MP in 2019. This is the highest number of complaints filed from MP ever since the UGC started the online complaint facility in 2009. UP topped the list with 152 complaints.Before this, 104 and 100 complaints were filed from MP in 2018 and 2017 respectively. In the past three years, ragging complaints have been on the rise. Only in 2012, MP had 32 ragging complaints, the lowest number of complaints. So far in 2020, MP has seen 10 ragging complaints filed in different colleges across the state.One more pattern the data revealed In MP was that male students registered more complaints than their female counterparts. In the past 10 years, 735 complaints were filed against boys while only 57 complaints were against girl students.Experts said that the time has come for the state to have its own legislation against ragging like other states have done. The neighbouring state of Maharashtra, where the number of ragging incidents had gone up in the late 90s, had introduced the Maharashtra Prohibition of Ragging Act 1999 to check the menace.Bhopal district court lawyer, Deepak Gour, said in the absence of legislation, there is no fear among the perpetrators. “There is no deterrence in this situation. It is tough to handle the situation in the absence of the state legislation,” said Gour. He added that there is a need to have a state legislation on ragging. “Ragging is rampant in colleges and there should be a state legislation,” he said.“Despite several incidents in the recent past, we are unable to register ragging cases,” said a cop, adding that the most severe punishment available in Madhya Pradesh for ragging is a mere suspension from the institute for a couple of days. A senior faculty said in this situation, the college also starts claiming that it was not ragging, but a fight among two groups of students.On the contrary, states where such anti-ragging laws are available have managed to tackle the situation.“A state like Andhra Pradesh has its own state anti-ragging law. It is called Andhra Pradesh Prohibition Act 1997. Last year, MP had witnessed 132 cases, while Andhra had seen only 29 cases. There is a need to have a state anti-ragging law,” said a senior faculty. Still, hardly any student from Madhya Pradesh was given strong punishment. In most cases, the accused either escaped unpunished or was awarded nominal monetary penalty and suspension from hostel.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74237794,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-678190,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/in-2019-mp-saw-highest-no-of-ragging-complaints-in-a-decade/articleshow/74232193.cms

Locals complained that they face immense difficulties in getting their Aadhaar cards made or making corrections to existing ones.

“Lack of Adhaar card enrollment centers in Old City areas has become a matter of concern for the applicants. The residents in need to apply for new cards or update old ones have to leave home early and stand in long queues to get their tokens,” said a resident, Syed Ghulam Mahmood Hussain.

The UIDAI has served notices to some locals, stating that they had obtained their Aadhaar cards by submitting false documents.

However, residents claimed that UIDAI makes deliberate mistakes despite details being clearly mentioned in the enrolment forms..

“It seems like UIDAI is not serious about its work. Syed is being printed as Sayd although correct spelling is written in the form. Instead of D/O, S/O, W/ O being carried, C/O is being mentioned,” Mohammed Abdul Moin, a local, told TOI.

However, officials of Akanksha Enterprises refuted the charges and said that they have deployed people round-the-clock to clean the ghats. “The corporation may have found the ghats unclean during rush hours and imposed the penalty. But I want to reiterate that adequate staff has been deployed for regular cleanliness of the ghats,” said Anil Tripathi, an official of the company. He added that 385 workers had been deputed to maintain the ghats and cleaning work was being done throughout the day in three shifts.

Notwithstanding the organisation’s claims, several social activists had been time and again raising the issue of improper cleaning of Ganga ghats, claiming that cleaning of the ghats was being done only on paper.

Social activist JP Badoni told TOI, “Government is spending huge amounts of money to clean the Ganga banks but no work is being done on the ground. Anybody can visit any ghat and check the sanitation conditions. In fact, a serious inquiry should be done on all works under the Namami Gange project in Haridwar. First, Rs 60 crore was claimed to have been spent in planting 50 lakh saplings and now Rs 15 crore is being spent on cleaning ghats but the cleanliness has not been happening.”

In response to residents’ concerns, a surprise inspection was ordered on Wednesday by commissioner of Haridwar Municipal Corporation Narendra Singh Bhandari who said that severe irregularities were found in cleaning the ghats after which the Rs 2 lakh penalty was imposed. “Sanitation inspectors of all the areas have been asked to conduct inspection regularly,” he said. Bhandari also conducted an inspection of the doo-to-door garbage collection service in the city on Thursday and ordered it to be streamlined.

Meanwhile, social organisations in the town claimed that prominent ghats were actually being cleaned by private sanitation workers hired by them, and not by the company mandated to do the work. General secretary of Ganga Sabha, Tanmay Vashisht told TOI, “We have hired sanitation workers to clean the Har-ki-Pauri and Malviya ghat. We don’t know about the work that is supposedly being done by Akanksha Enterprises. If they have been mandated to clean 72 ghats, their work should be monitored and assessed by relevant authorities.”

218,['21/02/2020'],Bhopal: Corona scare fades Holi spirit,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Traders worry that people will be less inclined to buy Chinese goods because of the rumours

BHOPAL: The ongoing “boycott” of Chinese goods in the wake of coronavirus scare might hamper Holi market adversely, worry vendors. Traders say that rumormongering and fake news on social media are hurting the consumer sentiment and scaring away people from markets with Chinese goods.

There were initial reports of stock shortage, but wholesalers say that they are ready for the festival of colours as they start stocking two-three months ago. Every year, fancy products like pichkari, water guns, magic balloons, masks and colour capsules come to India from China for the Holi season. Traders worry that people will be less inclined to buy Chinese goods because of the rumours.

“Chinese products are quite attractive and usually children make their parents buy them the products. They account for a good portion of our income…we already have stocks of Chinese waterguns and there is a slight worry in the market that they won’t sell this year,” said Manoj Kumar, a retailer in New Market. Bhopal gets most of its Holi paraphernalia from Indore and the remaining from Mumbai and New Delhi, said wholesaler Ashish Jain.

Nandu Bhai, a trader of water guns in Ranipura market, a leading wholesale market of Indore said, “China is not accepting any fresh order and the pace of goods committed to be dispatched in coming weeks has also slowed down.”

Traders say that Chinese factory manufacturing plastic products shut down during New Year which is why the Holi products are usually shipped earlier — way before the outbreak of the disease. In addition, there has been no new consignment from China for over a month.

But wholesale suppliers say there is little to worry about as they start stocking for festivals two-three months in advance. The stocks for Holi should not be a problem, but traders have no way to replenish their stocks as there will be no fresh stocks from China for the next few months, say wholesalers.

All Holi products are already in Indian warehouses a month ahead of the festival. Businessman Anand Taran said, “There will be no change in the market this year. Coronavirus will not affect business in Bhopal.”

The only problem is that there is a disagreeable sentiment towards China-made products at the moment, which might affect prices, said Jain.

Hoax messages have been circulating on social media, but experts say that these fears are unwarranted. Experts say, that no virus can survive so long inside a packet of Holi toys during the entire shipping process. Talking to TOI, Dr Saurabh Atulya said, “The rumours that Chinese goods are affected are baseless … There is no question of the virus being transmitted through Chinese goods like pichkaris, and even if it were a possibility, the climate of China and India is very different, and it is not possible for the virus to survive without a host. People should think rationally at this time.”

MADURAI: MDMK general secretary Vaiko on Thursday met members of the Muslim community protesting against the CAA and NRC in Mehaboopalayam in Madurai and expressed solidarity with them.

Speaking at the venue, Vaiko said the Muslim community members, including the women had set an example on how to protest peacefully. “You have made Mahatma Gandhi’s dream come true through this peaceful protest. The CAA has come to destroy the nation,” he said. It is an Act that has to be defeated, he added.

BJP leaders Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are trying to deprive the rights of the Muslims through these acts. Vaiko lauded the women, most of whom never came out on the roads to protest, for continuing their protest for the seventh day in succession. “We should continue till the Act is withdrawn,” he added. Earlier, speaking at a marriage function in Madurai, he said that the DMK had obtained two crore signatures against the Act and submitted it to the President of India. The people’s anger against the BJP is intensifying and it will go against them, he said.

MADURAI: Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) and State Bank of India (SBI) on Thursday launched a multi-purpose identity card which will enable students to get access to various department buildings, mark attendance and be used as a regular debit card.

“Ever since noticing that many rural families are still far from digitalisation, I wanted to introduce this card at our university which mainly caters to students in rural and remote areas. This card has been issued free of cost to the students. We would also be able to collect and document data of students and the university’s activities more easily,” said MKU vice-chancellor Dr M Krishnan . The university is currently in the process of achieving complete automation of its academic and administrative activities. It had recently introduced MKU-Mobile app / Web app as a platform for digital learning management system.

The MKU VC and the deputy managing director, SBI, J Swaminathan, launched the smart combo ID card and distributed it to students. About 1,500 PG students will first be making use of the cards. An MoU was signed for five years between the university and the bank to implement the project with SBI investing a total of Rs 20 lakh initially. “We are trying to promote electronic system of recording and reduce cash. We don’t see it as expenditure but rather an investment whenever we are working with educational institutions,” Swaminathan told the students. MKU is the fourth educational institution in the country to collaborate with SBI for issuing such combo cards.

MKU students availing of the card will get a zero balance savings bank account in SBI, MKU Branch . The card will then be issued free and the annual maintenance charge will also be waived until the students complete their course at MKU. The card will have a magnetic strip and EMV chip and can be used like a normal SBI ATM card. It will also have an additional chip for access control with multiple functions. The card will have the photograph of the student, university registration number, the programme and duration of the study. The smart combo ID card will operate as access card through which the student can attend class, use library, enter hostel premises and use common facilities like auditorium, language lab, various science labs, etc. When the students finish their course, the card can still be used as an ATM card but the data would be stored as alumni data.

Uttrakhand high court

NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Thursday ordered the principal of Dehradun-based Himalayan Ayurvedic Medical College , Anil Kumar Jha, to be personally present in court and explain why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him.

The Bench of Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma was hearing the contempt petition against the college filed by several students after the college failed to return the increased fee it had charged from students after a Government Order (GO) increased the fee from Rs 80,000 to over Rs 2.15 lakh.

The fee was increased retrospectively and even the students who were studying in senior years were made to pay the increased fee. “The state government, through a GO had in October 2015 increased the fee of Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medical Sciences (BAMS) by almost Rs 1.4 lakh. The fee was increased retrospectively. However, after a petition was filed, the court quashed the GO and ordered all the colleges to return the extra fee that had been charged from the students,” said Vinod Tiwari, the counsellor appearing for the students who have approached the court.

Tiwari added that despite the court’s order, several colleges did not comply and in fact filed a special appeal before the division bench. “That appeal was also dismissed by the court and they were again ordered to return the fee. However, as the colleges did not return the amount again, students approached the court and filed a contempt petition against the college,” he said.

“The court has now ordered the principal to be personally present in the court on March 2 and explain why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him under the Contempt of Courts Act,” Tiwari said, adding that around 1,000 students are to be issued refund amounting to around Rs 80 crore from 13 colleges in the state that provide the course.

As reported by TOI earlier, several colleges had charged the increased amount, however, even after around two years since the HC order many students are still awaiting refund.

Meanwhile, Bal Krishna Chamoli, secretary of Himalayan Ayurvedic Medical College, said that the college has complied with court orders earlier and will follow whatever directions the court gives even now. “However, the thing that has to be kept in mind is that the fee for BAMS courses have not been hiked since 2004 even though the input costs have increased many a times. The cap on fee is stressing on our financial situation,” Chamoli said.

JAIPUR: Partially burnt body of a woman was found in Langadiyawas of Amber area on Thursday. The police are yet to ascertain the woman’s identity.

The police suspect that after murdering the woman, the unidentified persons dumped the body on Amber-Langadiyawas Road. “Prima facie, it appears to be a case of murder. However, anything concrete could be said only after the body is identified. We have sent the photographs of the charred body to the nearby police stations and are also checking the missing report registers across the state for identification,” said a senior police officer of Amber police station.

Control room and other police stations have also been intimated for any information on the woman. “As the body is charred and was put in a sack, it appears that the miscreants wanted to conceal her identity, in order to go scot-free. However, we will identify the body to solve the mystery,” the officer added.

From the appearance of the body, it seems that the deceased woman may have been aged between 30 and 35 years.

A black thread has been found tied on her ankle. The police have also found an amulet.

The police are quizzing people in the nearby areas like shopkeepers, tea shop owners and pan wallahs to find any clue. Also, they are scouring CCTVs, which could provide them some clue about the identity of the woman.

TRICHY: A 29-year-old cyclist from Assam on a pan-India mission to spread awareness on public hygiene reached Trichy on Thursday. Sensitising people to dump their waste only in dustbins, the man has so far covered 18 states and Union territories on his bicycle with the support of people he never knew.

Luis Das who hails from Morigaon district in Assam is employed as a helper in an ashram in Haridwar. He says his journey is inspired by the Swachh Bharat mission envisaged at keeping India clean and litter-free. He wanted to contribute his mite to the mission and hence embarked on ‘Bharat Yatra’ on his mountain bicycle on October 30 last year from Haridwar, Uttarakhand. Passing through 18 states and union territories including Sikkim, Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha, Das reached Chennai last week from where he cycled to Trichy via Puducherry. “During my nationwide trip, I have been sensitising school students on disposing waste only in bins. Absence of public hygiene is the major cause of diseases,” Das told TOI. He also spoke about the importance of using toilets. In Trichy where public garbage bins were removed as a part of Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) guidelines, Das told the public to dump waste where bins are available, or else in the bins available at houses.

The bicycle is fitted with boards promoting awareness on cleanliness and speakers for spreading messages on cleanliness. Das managed to purchase the bicycle worth Rs 9,000 with his money, but now relies completely on strangers for money, food and even to charge his mobile phone for GPS needs during his journey. “I spend nights at petrol bunks, eateries, temples and hospital campuses — wherever they permit and I feel safe. Having made friends in all the states I visited, I will use the contacts constructively to promote cleanliness,” Das added. With Kochi in Kerala as his next pit stop, Das plans to cover all the states and Union territories with his awareness messages in the next three months.

NEW DELHI: The national human rights commission and its autonomous counterparts in states have unanimously demanded that the government should define “human rights offences” in the NHRC legislation in order to give the commission greater clarity and teeth. They also dwelt on the need for clarity in the scope of offences being tried at the human rights courts established in the country.

Addressing issues that pertain to the running of NHRCs and SHRCs during a day-long meeting convened by NHRC, chairs and members of the rights commission stressed on the need for clarity on the nature of offences that can be tried and the procedure to be followed to try such offences.

While members acknowledged that the Supreme Court may fill the lacuna by making guidelines to ensure that human rights courts are guided on which cases to try and how, in the absence of the judgement, they called for the need for clarity.

On Thursday, NHRC chairman Justice H L Dattu also asked all state human rights commissions to join its common portal to avoid duplication of complaint registration. Dattu said that in order to expand its outreach, the commission had integrated its online complaint filing system with common service portal of the centre and was encouraging SHRCs to join the HRCNET portal.

“Most of the state commissions have joined this portal. I take this opportunity to urge state commissions which are yet to join the portal to do the same at the earliest to avoid duplication of complaint registration on the same issue,” he said.

According to another NHRC official, 22 states have joined the portal so far.

On Thursday, the members in attendance also said NHRC will recommend to the home ministry to consider amendments to the NHRC Act to clarify the issues raised by the rights commissions through their discussions.

NEW DELHI: Police registered an FIR for mischief by killing or maiming animals (429 IPC) and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to probe a case of acid attack on a dog in Paharganj.

In an incident that occurred earlier this month, a woman resident of Mantola lodged a complaint after a man in the locality allegedly poured acid on a street dog. An animal rights activist from the area, too, submitted a complaint against the man who had allegedly threatened to maim the rest of the strays dogs if they barked at him.

On February 7, the complainant heard the wails of a dog outside her house and found the animal with severe burns on its face and back. She and other residents then got the canine treated.

“This was not the first time that a dog had been attacked in the locality,” said Megha Arora, an activist and a resident of the area. The residents decided to register a complaint against the suspect at Pahargunj police station.

“We told police that many other dogs had suffered injuries after being hit by nails sticking out of wooden planks or by acid-like substances,” she said. Arora said that so far no one had been arrested in this case.

“We are probing the role of a person who has been identified as a suspect and will take appropriate action,” an officer said.

Farmers have raised apprehensions about the duration of the ongoing hydrocarbon exploration projects

TRICHY: Delta farmers have raised apprehensions about the duration of the ongoing hydrocarbon exploration projects even while hailing chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami for introducing the Protected Agriculture Zone Development Bill 2020 in the assembly on Thursday.

When ongoing projects have already made the entire agriculture land in the delta region unproductive, allowing companies more years to explore would only harm the very purpose of announcing the districts as protected zone, they opined. Cauvery Delta Farmers Association president Cauvery S Dhanapalan said the farmers’ prime demand was to close down existing oil wells dug by ONGC in the delta region. But chief minister has announced that the ongoing processes would continue, thereby creating confusion and apprehensions among the farmers. “State government should ask oil companies to declare how long they would take to complete the ongoing extraction. Otherwise, they may continue the process for years stating that the contract period is not over”, he opined.

If the existing exploration projects continued and newly announced ones would not be revoked, what is the purpose of announcing the delta as protected zone, asked the secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, Swamimalai S Vimalnathan. “Already oil companies have damaged our entire resources. Now the state government has given them more time to exploit it further”, he said. Coordinator of Cauvery Rights Retrieval Committee P Maniarasan wondered what was the urgency in passing the bill on a single day without holding discussions. “The bill should have been referred to select committee for further clarification and to get a proper shape so that it would not be struck down by courts”, he stressed.

State secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam P S Masilamani sid in Tiruvarur that the bill has been passed in a hasty manner without examining how to strengthen it, just for political mileage. President of All Farmers Associations’ Coordination Committee P R Pandian urged opposition parties to support the state government’s efforts to get the bill included in the Union government’s gazette and for getting the Presidential assent.

“The state government should insist that the Union government give up the recently announced hydrocarbon projects. Besides ONGC, new contracts handed over to Reliance and Vedanta should also be withdrawn”, he added.

DEHRADUN: Thousands of government employees under the umbrella of General-OBC Employees’ Federation staged a march from Parade Ground towards the chief minister’s residence on Thursday. The protesters also had a heated altercation with police teams as the route of their proposed march was changed at the last minute.

The government employees are demanding lifting of ban on departmental promotion saying that even the Supreme Court (SC) has taken a decision in their favour and the government should now implement the SC decision.

As per the initial plan, the march was to move from Darshanlal Chowk to Clock Tower and thereafter move towards the CM’s residence. However, the protesters were directed towards the Astley Hall crossing, which led to a scuffle between the employees and the police team. The police team deployed near the Hathibarkala barricade stopped the protesters. The employees thereafter sat on the ground and raised slogans against the state government.

This was the second major protest in a short span of a week, the first being on February 14. The employees have threatened to go on an indefinite work boycott if their demands are not met.

“We are ready for a do-or-die battle. The employees should not be deprived of their rights. Several employees have retired without getting promotion and with even the Supreme Court order now, there is no reason why the ban on departmental promotion committee meeting is continuing. It should be lifted to pave way for promotion of employees,” Deepak Joshi, who heads the association of secretariat employees and is also the chairperson of Uttarakhand General-OBC Employees Association, said.

He added, “Despite the Supreme Court order on the issue of reservation in promotion on February 7 this year, the state government has not yet revoked its order of September 11, 2019, through which it had stopped promotion in government jobs.”

Virendra Singh Gosain, the general secretary of Uttarakhand General-OBC Employees Association, said that the state government needs to stick to the new reservation roster in government jobs. “We are against any sort of change in the roster,” he added.

Meanwhile, CM Trivendra Rawat when queried about the issue on Thursday, said that talks will be held with those who are protesting. “We will find out a solution by holding talks,” he added.

Dehradun: A Mumbai-based man hailing from Uttarakhand has launched a crowdfunding campaign to collect money for paying back outstanding bank loan of the family of legendary surveyor Nain Singh Rawat , who worked in Survey of India during the British era in Dehradun, and who is believed to have determined for the first time the location and altitude of Tibet’s capital Lhasa, and surveyed a large section of the Brahmaputra.

Speaking with TOI over the phone, Prayag Rawat, who hails from the same area in Kumaon as Nain Singh, said that he came to know about the financial crisis faced by the famous surveyor’s descendants, and decided to chip in. “It was very disheartening to know that one of Nain Singhji’s descendants, Kavindra Singh Rawat died in a road accident in August last year and the family is struggling to pay back a loan of Rs 19 lakh,” he told TOI, adding that when he came to know of Kavindra’s death, he contacted the family to find out how he can help. “I came to know that the family has to pay Rs 9 lakh as the final settlement amount for the loan taken by Kavindra Singh Rawat in 2015. The family lives in Madot village in the Pithoragarh district. Kavindra used to run a taxi and after his death, there is no one to look after the family.”

Rawat said that he decided to start a crowdfunding campaigning to help them and so far, has collected Rs 2 lakh from people in Mumbai. “Since my childhood, I had a great fascination for the work of Nain Singh Rawat. I am happy that people have been so forthcoming to help the family financially.” Meanwhile, speaking to TOI, Kavindra Singh Rawat’s wife Kamla, said, “Prayagji’s offer to help has come as a big boon to us since we have been struggling to make ends meet after my husband’s death.”

238,['21/02/2020'],Govt submits status report of Viveka murder case to HC,"This story is from February 21, 2020

The state government on Thursday submitted the status report of the investigation into the YS Vivekananda Reddy murder case by the special investigation team ( SIT ) to the high court in a sealed cover. Advocate general S Sriram told the high court that the petitioners did not satisfy the tests laid down by the Supreme Court guidelines to transfer the investigation of the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

Sriram further argued that the petitioners are making allegations against each other. While Adinarayana Reddy said Prasad is continuing as the family’s driver, Vivekananda Reddy’s wife Sowbhagyamma and daughter Sunitha named Adinarayana Reddy and B Tech Ravi. This indicates that the police are doing a neutral job, he argued.

The advocate general further said that the SIT has examined 1,461 suspects, seven gangs, 31 high-profile offenders and gangs of hired assassins. Due to the fact that there was screening of evidence, the police have had to rely on forensic evidence, Narco and brain mapping. He said a few applications for Narco tests were rejected.

Justifying the stand of the state government not to hand over the case to the CBI, the advocate general said the subjective anxiety and self-serving pleas of the petitioners cannot be enough to lay a basis for disbelieving the state police. He said the high court is not the place for mini trial of the case which is what the petitioners want in contrary to the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution. Vague pleadings and unsubstantiated contentions cannot form the basis of a writ petition to transfer the case to CBI, he argued.

As the investigation is at an advanced stage and likely to conclude in the next two months, there is no need for a CBI probe at this stage, said the advocate general. After hearing his arguments, the high court directed him to submit the case dairies and general dairies of the case and posted the matter for further hearing to Monday.

Trichy: Saying that innovation and creativity in rural economy is essential for development, deputy advisor, national assessment and accreditation council (NAAC) New Delhi, Devender S Kawday said if enough output is created in rural economy, through agriculture or cottage industry, we can bring about a revolution.

He was addressing students on the concluding day of Gyanotsav 2020 at National College Trichy on Thursday. The country should focus on rural economy as we are diverting ourselves from rural economy to urban economy, he said. Only 2.3% of our population is skillful, but we have excellent minds here, and we are unable to push them towards innovation.

Educational institutions should ignite the minds of rural people for the sake of developing their skills. We have 37.4 million, which is the highest student population in the world. Even if one percent of population starts thinking in this area, there will be a big change. Agriculture is going to be very important in future, he said.

Agriculture is not profitable in the country, but 60% of population depends on agriculture. He said India’s contribution to world GDP was more than 25% two centuries back. Now that we have about 18% of the world’s population, but the contribution to the world economy came down to 2.3%.

P Kanagasabapathi from Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) stressed on the need to have basic education in mother tongue to effective learning.

PUNE: Four men stole at least 140 smartphones and Rs1.47 lakh, totally worth Rs17.72 lakh, from a store in Bhosari around 3am on Wednesday, put the gadgets in two backpacks and spent some time next to a bonfire to beat the pre-dawn chill barely two stores away before fleeing.

Police said the bonfire was on in front of a jewellery store and the four men shared its warmth along with two persons, including the watchman of one of the shops in the area. The police said the duo did not even realize that the four men were sitting next to them and having a hearty chat after committing a theft.

The crime came to light around 10am when two employees of Shri Sai Enterprises opened the shutter of the store and found the empty boxes of cellphones lying all over. They alerted shop owner Visham Nimse (32), who lodged an FIR with the police.

Nimse told TOI that the shop had eight CCTV cameras, but the thieves had made off with their digital video recorder as well. “We obtained CCTV footage from the neighbouring shop and found that four persons were involved in the crime,” he said.

The shop owner said the footage revealed that the four men had entered the store around 3am by breaking the locks of its shutter. He said, “They took the smart phone boxes from the display rack. They took away nearly 140 handsets, each worth around Rs10,000, but left the chargers behind. They also stole Rs1.47 lakh from the cash counter inside the store.”

Nimse said the CCTV footage also showed the four men coming out of the store with two backpacks and then halting near the bonfire in front of the jewellery store. “One person was sitting near the bonfire. They had a talk with him for quite some time. The watchman of the shop was also there. But they apparently did not suspect anything unusual,” he said.

An officer from the Bhosari police said, “We have shared the CCTV footage showing the four men with our informers. We are working on some clues to arrest them.”

According to them, it could be a 'new habitat' for tigers apart from their regular homes – Corbett and Rajaji Tiger reserves.On Wednesday, some students on their way to school had spotted the big cat, which was unable to move. They informed the forest department about it. The four-year-old male tiger was tranquilised by a team of four veterinary doctors and experts from Wildlife Institute of India. On Thursday morning, the big cat was moved to Chidiyapur Rescue Centre of forest department where it is now being given preliminary treatment.The doctors treating the tiger said that the wild cat is unable to move due to weak muscles in its hind legs. Samples are being sent to IVRI for further tests. “We are keeping the tiger under observation and it is being administered drips as it was dehydrated. The next course of treatment would depend on the reports,” said Dr Amit Dhyani, veterinary officer of forest department. Poaching is ruled out from the scene as per the DFO of Pauri, Sant Ram.“Tigers are certainly moving uphill, as this one was spotted 20km north of Rajaji and Corbett Tiger reserves. Pauri Garhwal, therefore, is emerging as a new habitat for tigers. Last year we saw a camera footage of a tigress in Yamkeshwar block. From the past one month, villagers said that have felt the presence of tigers here. Now we are certain,"" said Vaibhav Singh, DFO Rudraprayag.Experts have indicated tigers’ presence in Kedarnath and in areas as high as Askot in Pithoragarh at 12,000 feet. “Tigers are extremely resilient animals. They travel a lot when it is required. Their movement in search of new territory can be seen as a mark of rising population as well as seasonal migration,” added Sant Ram.

But, many college going students who are still under age, ride two-wheelers with utter impunity.A 17-year-old student from a college in the Deccan area said, “I have been using a two-wheeler for commute ever since I joined college. The public transport in the city is erratic and the autorickshaws are expensive. Having a two-wheeler at my disposal is convenient.”Another student (17) from the area said she had to travel to college and various tuition classes.“My home, college and classes are located in different areas and using a two-wheeler is the most reliable form of commute for me to reach on time,” she said.The death of a 16-year-old rider in the city in January has once again highlighted the dangers of underage driving. In that incident, the 15-year-old pillion rider had sustained serious injuries.A casual glance at any busy road in Pune shows that there is no dearth of minors riding in a way that puts their — and others’ — lives at risk.A 16-year-old student from Wanowrie said, “The public transport connectivity in our area is not up to the mark. I have to change buses at either Swargate or Pune station. The buses mostly aren’t on time either. If not a two-wheeler, what other options am I left with?”Devendra Mehta, a businessman, said he knew a 15-year-old student who rode a Royal Enfield motorcycle. “On a daily basis, I also see children between 15 and 18 years riding two-wheelers and flouting rules — riding triple seat, not wearing helmets or riding in a no-entry zone.,” he said.Harshad Abhyankar, director of Save Pune Traffic Movement, said there were many reasons for minors using vehicles. “Not too long ago, licences were easy for even 16-year-olds. Many have seen their elder siblings use a vehicle at that age and want the same. Children attend several classes and using a two-wheeler seems convenient. But, none of this justifies underage driving,” Abhyankar said, adding road safety should become a part of school and college curriculum.According to the police, 285 cases were registered and Rs1.42 lakh in fines was collected from offenders last year.Samaiirah from Safe Roads Foundation said, “All too often, parents themselves let their children use two-wheelers to run errands, but they need to understand the consequences of this.”Under the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, in cases of underage driving, parents or the vehicle’s owner will be held responsible.Sujit Patwardhan, the founder of local NGO Parisar, which works towards road safety, said his granddaughter used to ride a two-wheeler to buy things from nearby shops. “We explained the consequences to her. she understood and stopped. But, her underage friends continue to ride vehicles. Parents should step in,” he said.Patwardhan said it was incumbent upon the traffic police to nip this problem in the bud. “Confiscating the vehicle from a minor and handing it over to his/her parents is one way. The police could also force offenders to do social work as a deterrent,” he said.Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham said a softer approach was needed. “We need to apply a reformative approach, rather than punishment, for this age group,” he said. “Accordingly, we are focusing on counselling, under which 35,000 students have been made aware about the dangers of underage driving in more than 287 counselling sessions,” he added.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74239705,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-186035,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/minors-bend-rules-to-hop-on-2-wheelers-for-convenience/articleshow/74233038.cms

Exert pressure on Centre: CPI state secretary K Ramakrishna addresses the round-table meeting in Guntur on Thu... Read More

Guntur: CPI state secretary K Ramakrishna has demanded that the state government take an all-party delegation to New Delhi to press the Centre to grant special category status ( SCS ) to Andhra Pradesh.

Addressing a round-table meeting here on Thursday, Ramakrishna criticised chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy for not being able to exert pressure on the Centre despite winning 22 Lok Sabha seats from the state. “Jagan promised to achieve SCS had people given him 25 Lok Sabha seats. People trusted him and handed him 22 seats. He has thoroughly disappointed the people in the last nine months,” said Ramakrishna.

The constitution of an all-party delegation, he said, would help put pressure on the BJP as all parties at the national level, except BJP, were in favour of granting SCS to AP.

Aam Admi Party (AAP) leader and vice-president of Pratyeka Hoda Atma Gaurava Porata Committee, Dr Seva Kumar, said people would lose trust in the democratic system if the Centre did not honour promises made in Parliament. He said Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu had demanded granting SCS for 10 years while former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh promised to give SCS to AP for five years.

Seva Kumar said they would chalk out a plan to intensify the agitation for SCS.

NEW DELHI: After China objected to home minister Amit Shah ’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh, India hit back and said Beijing’s objection to government functionaries visiting the state did not “stand to reason and understanding of the Indian people’’.

India’s position on Arunachal Pradesh had been clear and consistent that it was an integral and inalienable part of the country , foreign ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said. “Indian leaders routinely travel to the state of Arunachal Pradesh as they do to any other state of India,’’ he added.

China, which claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of south Tibet , objected to Shah's visit to the state, saying it violated Beijing's ""territorial sovereignty"".

“China's position on the eastern sector of the China-India boundary, or the southern part of China's Tibet region, is consistent and clear,"" China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing on Thursday.

“The Chinese government has never recognised the so-called ‘Arunachal Pradesh' and is firmly opposed to the Indian politician's visit to the southern part of China's Tibet region as it violated China's territorial sovereignty, undermined stability of the border area, sabotaged political mutual trust, and violated relevant bilateral agreement,"" he added.

Shah was in Arunachal Pradesh to attend the 34th Statehood Day function and launched a number of development projects.

Addressing a rally at Indira Gandhi Park in Itanagar , Shah said, “Misinformation was spread after abrogation of Article 370 that Article 371 will also be scrapped. It will never happen and nobody can do it.” He added that the NDA government was committed to preserve and protect the unique culture and tradition of the north-east.

Article 371 has special provisions to preserve the cultural heritage and customary laws of north-eastern states.

The home minister said, “Previously, the region got importance on political lines. But PM Narendra Modi initiated efforts to unite the NE with the rest of the country.” Shah said central ministers visited the region more than 200 times in the past five years and the PM visited 30 times.

He added that the north-east enjoyed a special place in the country for its unique culture and tradition and unless the region was developed, cultural integration could not take place.

China routinely objects to Indian politicians visits to Arunachal Pradesh. The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control. The two countries have so far held 22 rounds of special representative talks to resolve the border dispute.

Vijayawada: Even after six months of the new excise policy coming into force, de-addiction centres remain a non-starter in the state.

The government brought in the new excise policy with an aim to impose a complete liquor ban in a phased manner. As part of implementing the complete liquor prohibition , the state government proposed the establishment of de-addiction centres across the state to help tipplers give up their habit.

The government was proposed the setting up of at least one de-addiction centre in every district in the first phase and to increase the number as needed. However, these centres have not taken off yet anywhere in the state. Though the previous government mooted the establoshemtn of de-addiction centres under project ‘Jagruthi’, the proposal still remained on paper.

The YSRC government, which came up with and implemented complete liquor prohibition as a policy, emphasised on the establishment of de-addiction centres to rehabilitate people seriously addicted to liquor. Officials have even studied the models of Kerala and Punjab where the state governments are successfully running de-addiction centres, but little progress was made in starting the centres in AP.

In August, the government announced that these centres will be established by coordinating with the medical and health departments by recruiting expert counsellors, psychiatrists and other medical staff required. Nothing has materialised till now and all the proposals are still in the planning stage.

Speaking to TOI, V Lakshmana Reddy, chairman of Madya Vimochana Prachara Committee said that the state government has identified the locations to establish the de-addiction centres in all 13 districts. “The basic idea is to attach these centres to the teaching hospitals wherever possible. The staff recruitment and infrastructure procurement is going on and they will start functioning soon. Apart from the 13 centres being established by the state government, six de-addiction centres also coming up in the state with the help and funding of union government,” he said.

Vivek Yadav, commissioner of prohibition and excise department, said that there are many de-addiction centres in the state in the private sector which are not up to the mark. “The establishment of de-addiction centres is a work in progress and they will start functioning soon,” he said.

Yogesh Sindhav who thrashed principal of a college in Jamnagar

RAJKOT: In a brazen case of hooligansim in a college, a 19-year-old student hurled profanities at a woman lecturer and thrashed the principal in Sikka town near Jamnagar.

The incident happened in the arts and commerce college run by Jamnagar Digvijay Gram Panchayat on Wednesday when the second-year BCom student Yogesh Sindhav barged into the class the middle of the lecture without permission. He was stopped by teacher Dr Hetal Bhatt who asked him to wait until the class got over.

However, Sindhav got enraged and started hurling expletives at her in front of all other students. He then threatened Bhatt and asked her to get out of the classroom. Bhatt immediately went to principal Mahavirsinh Jadeja who rushed to the classroom and talked to Sindhav. But an unapologetic Sindhav started abusing Jadeja too and started thrashing him. Jadeja suffered minor injuries after he fell on the ground when Sindhav pushed him.

Hearing the commotion, other students and staff members rushed to the classroom and caught hold of Sindhav. While leaving, Sindhav dared Jadeja to lodge a complaint against and threatened to kill him if he did so.

Principal Jadeja confirmed that Sindhav has a penchant of threatening teachers in the college. “Last semester, he had brazenly tried to copy in the exam. But after villagers intervened, he gave a written apology.""

Investigating officer RK Gadhvi told TOI that Sindhav’s father Lakshman is a listed bootlegger and a detainee under Prevention of Anti-Social Activities (PASA) Act.

Sindhav is a habitual offender and often gets into arguments with the teachers. Talking to TOI, Dr Bhatt said, “Sindhav often comes late into the class and has got ATKT in the first semester. In December too, he had behaved rudely with teachers.”

RK Gadhvi, investigating officer, Sikka police station said, “Entire college has CCTV network. In the footages, Sindhav is clearly seen forcibly entering the classroom and then intimidating the lecturer. He is also seen smashing the principal after which students force him out the campus.”Sindhav has fled after the complaint was lodged against him.

Pithora artwork depicting tribal gods and ancestors

Vadodara: If the post-migration city-sleek tribals of central Gujarat have changed their sartorial tastes drastically, how can their deities lag behind? So, to suit changing preferences, the entire culture gets a massive makeover — both for the deity and the devotee. All of them are now denim-clad, technologically advanced, gun-totting metrosexuals!

All of these emerging trends are getting mirrored in the traditional Pithora paintings too.

Traditional Pithora artists, or Lakharas, too have thrown out the ‘dhoti’, ‘langot’ and horses from their artworks to depict deities in trousers, driving a truck or riding a bike!

Pithora artwork which adorns every household of the Rathwa community depict tribal gods and even ancestors in these paintings. The acquired taste is, however, prominently becoming visible on public buildings like health centres and schools in Chhota Udepur.

“These new additions are being made on demands from the clients,” explained Nandu Rathwa of Baroj village. According to Rathwa, the clients no longer like the look of their gods in human forms wearing ‘dhoti’, as they do not look good on the walls!

“So, we have no option but to show them wearing pants,” said the painter who has been making such artwork since he was 10 years old. Lakhara, however, vouches that the sartorial changes will not destroy the traditional Pithora artwork as every Rathwa continues to patronize the traditional paintings at their homes.

Ratan Rathwa’s paintings have a few additional accessories to match the deities outfit — like a gun instead of the original bow and arrow! The painter asserted with pride that along with the demands of clients, these are his own ideas added to the paintings.

City-based art promoter Sachin Kaluskar, however, pitched in for the tribal painters. He said: “An artist brings out what he sees or observes around himself. Secondly, to sell or to make people accept their art, they bring out elements that people from urban areas can connect with.”

Kaluskar had curated a project wherein two American artists and five Pithora artists had come together to create a Glo-Cal art wall on the façade of Sir Sayaji Nagargruh in Akota.

263,['21/02/2020'],VMC set to beautify canal bunds at cost of Rs 400 crore,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Vijayawada: Canal bunds across the district, which resemble dumping sites, are all set to get a major facelift soon. The project is estimated to cost Rs 400 crore.

The district administration is gearing up to strengthen canal bunds across the state and transform them into beautiful landscapes. Following the directions of chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy, the district administration will clear around 1,344 kilometres of canal bands in the district in the first phase.

Irrigation canals have a great significance in the city. Three irrigation canals—Eluru canal, Ryves Canal and Bandar canal—pass through the city. A major portion of tje city is located in the middle of these three irrigation canals. With the population growing in the city, canal bunds have become a hub for dumping garbage and construction waste.

The Telugu Desam-led state government, which focused on canal bund development, had failed to complete beautification works.

Krishna district administration and Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) started a canal cleaning drive in city and identified around 350 locations where drain water was flowing into the canals. Officials said mini sewage treatment plants would be constructed at these locations to prevent this.

“We are happy that chief minister appreciated our efforts in cleaning the canals. We have designed a special plan to clear around 36 canals in the district. We have already erected fences on bridges to prevent garbage being dumped into the canals. We will soon strengthen the canal bunds and develop parks, walking tracks and open gyms,” district collector A Mohammed Imtiaz said.

VADODARA: The detection of crime branch (DCB) has launched a manhunt for tracing the three missing members of the ‘ Taadpatri ’ gang who were involved in a theft and attack on the police team.

The trio — identified as Amro Bhil, Alpesh Bariya and Ratna Meetha — was roped in by the key gang members for stealing valuables from trucks and transporting them safely, said cops, adding that they are also trying to recover goods stolen by the gang in several similar thefts in the past.

“This gang has nine members and we have already nabbed six of them. Efforts are on to trace the remaining trio who were paid to steal for the gang,” said a crime branch official.

“This gang operates from Godhra and usually strikes in different cities of Gujarat . Godhra has about five to six such gangs and they all have similar modus operandi. They steal valuables from trucks by cutting open the tarpaulin. The valuables are then sold off,” the police said.

The gang usually operates in evening or night so that passers-by don’t notice them when they steal from the trucks parked on the highway or near hotels. This gang had attacked the cops on February 4 when they were spotted while stealing some valuables from a truck. They managed to flee from the spot after damaging two police vehicles before getting nabbed by the crime branch.

Vijayawada: The high court, on Thursday, posted the hearing on a batch of petitions challenging GO 72 issued by the health, medical and family welfare department fixing the fee structure for various courses in unaided and non-minority medical colleges. However, the high court posted the matter for fresh hearing on March 12 as the composition of the bench changed.

The GO increasing the fee for MD, MS and diploma courses in medical colleges and MDS courses in dental colleges was issued on May 3, 2017. The high court was moved with a public interest litigation (PIL) back in 2017 and two other writ petitions were also moved by students.

Earlier, the case was heard in part by the high court. Now, as the composition of judges has changed in the chief justice court, the bench on Thursday said would hear the matter afresh on March 12.

The petitioners sought relief from the high court contending GO 72, according to which the tuition fee in medical and dental colleges has been increased. They argued that the hike in fee is exorbitant and is in violation of Andhra Pradesh Educational Institutions Act and the Supreme Court judgments on similar matters.

The petitioners sought directions to set aside the GO 72 through which the fees have been increased manifold and to restore the old fee structure prior to the issuance of impugned GO. They also sought directions to refund the excess amount collected by the college managements, with interest.

The milestones were found adjacent to a travellers bungalow located on the Trichy-Thanjavur national highway

TRICHY: Two milestones, believed to be over 170-year-old, with Tamil numerals to denote distance on highways were found near Sengipatti in Thajavur district . If confirmed, it will establish the wide prevalence of Tamil numerals during pre-independence era.

The milestones were found adjacent to a travellers bungalow located on the Trichy-Thanjavur national highway.

“These milestones were erected in 1849 by the British Government during the road improvement phase,” said Manganoor A Manikandan, a research fellow in the Department of Ancient science of Tanjore Tamil University . He led a team consisting of Karu Rajendran and T Manisekaran to Sengipatti in Thanjavur where the milestones were spotted by social activist M Sekar.

Manikandan said that the milestones were erected during the British regime when a new road was laid and named road number 7 from Trichy to Tanjore via Thiruvarambur and termed it a significant finding that shows the use of Tamil numerals in daily life of the common folks. “The road has a bridge and was in a good state, writes Lewis Moore, in the District Manual of the Tiruchirappalli under presidency of Madras, on June 28, 1878. This helps us establish the date of the milestones,” he said.

Anti-CAA protests continued to keep the police on their toes in Trichy

TRICHY: Anti-CAA protests continued to keep the police on their toes in Trichy and other districts in the central region for the fourth consecutive day on Thursday. While the sit-in by a group of Muslims entered the third day at Uzhavar Sandhai grounds here, the protesters kept the flock together with about 200 people present anytime.

Trichy city police had already booked over 200 people in the past two days for unlawful assembly at the Uzhavar Sandhai grounds. In all, 16 leaders of Muslim outfits including PFI and parties like CPM and Naam Tamilar Katchi were booked besides 2,484 people including 50 women for intentionally insulting with an intent to cause an offence against the state and public tranquillity by staging an agitation near district collector office on Wednesday.

Students of Jamal Mohammed College (JMC) in Trichy and from some other colleges in the city staged a demonstration in front of JMC on Thursday afternoon also. It was the show of dissent by the students for the third consecutive day. The students went ahead with the protests despite the police naming the leading protesters in the first information report for the past two days. A police officer said that case will be filed against those staging protests without permission from the police.

The KK Nagar police booked three students of JMC, MIET college and Urumu Dhanalakshmi College in Trichy and 50 others for unlawful assembly over the CAA issue near the college on Wednesday. The three students had already been booked by KK Nagar police for spearheading the protest on Tuesday also. CPI also staged a demonstration against CAA near Gandhi market led by party state president R Muthrasan. The police said about 50 people took part in the demonstration.

Muslim outfits in the districts in the central region also maintained the tempo by carrying out protests at 13 places in Pudukottai , Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagappattinam districts on Thursday. Going by the calculation of the police, about 3,000 people including 2,000 Muslim women participated in the protests.

268,['21/02/2020'],PSUs plan PR blitz to spruce up govt image,"This story is from February 21, 2020

NEW DELHI: The government is lining up a public relations blitz to tom-tom its ‘achievements’ with the tagline, ‘Har ek kaam desh ke naam (each work is for the country), a move seen as the BJP ’s attempt to refurbish its ‘development party’ image that had taken some beating during the Delhi assembly election campaign.

The oil ministry, one of the Centre’s key public interface has got off to an early start, asking executives of PSUs under its wings to plan mass campaigns explaining how the work done by the ministry is improving people’s lives. The company honchos — usually reluctant to open their mouth — have also been put on the job and advised to, as one source said, “actively spread the good word”.

The ministry has given each of the flagship companies a theme to work on. The country’s largest refiner-retailer IndianOil, for example, has been asked to use the imminent countrywide launch of BS-VI fuels as the launchpad for its campaign and showcase it as an anti-pollution and public health milestone. Same is the case for gas utility GAIL, which will use the proposed rollout of city gas networks in 400 districts as a means to help cities breathe easy.

“The law of diminishing returns have caught up with Ujjwala (the scheme for giving free LPG connections to poor households), the Narendra Modi government’s social welfare blockbuster that had yielded rich political dividends. There is a belief that the BJP’s image as a development-oriented party suffered due to its shrill campaign during the Delhi election. There is also an air of despondency over the economy. BS-VI rollout is a big achievement and a perfect prop to rejuvenate the government’s image,” a person in the know said requesting anonymity.

India is set to leapfrog from BS-IV to BS-VI vehicles and fuels from April 1. BS-VI has nearly the same — or better in some areas — emission parameters as a CNG ( compressed natural gas ) vehicle. Delhi had switched to BS-VI two years before the deadline, while the entire NCR (national capital region) covering cities in UP and Haryana neighbouring Delhi had done so in October 2019.

The companies are likely to go to town with billboards and hoardings at their petrol stations as well as advertisements. This is the second time in recent times that the ministry wants to create public awareness about an initiative that touches people’s lives. It had a fortnight back held a brainstorming session with states and other stakeholders for launching city gas services in 400 districts. Here too, a blue flame denoting cleaner air in cities subtly highlighted the event’s public health underpinning, transforming a business gathering to a social welfare event.

Being one of the Centre’s key public interface, the oil ministry is no stranger to stepping up to promoting government’s objectives. In the aftermath of demonetisation, the state-run fuel retail companies had played a major role in promoting digital payments and later easing cash woes by offering limited cash withdrawals through cards.

Jaipur: With the allocation of Rs 39,524 crore to the education sector, the state government will be focusing on enhancing infrastructure of schools and colleges this year.

The government has also announced to open 167 English-medium schools at block levels this financial year. CM Ashok Gehlot has said that buildings will be constructed for the 18 new colleges announced last year.

To fulfil the long-standing demand for extra rooms in the schools, the Budget has proposed to build extra rooms in 200 higher secondary schools in the state.

A special cadre for computer teachers has also been proposed. To promote girls’ education, 66 new Kasturba Gandhi Residential Schools have been proposed.

The state government will also be focusing on skill development. Skill Enhancement and Employable Training (SEET) will be started for students studying in colleges. CM Ashok Gehlot announced around 10,000 students will be trained every year under SEET with the help of Skills University and Rajasthan Skill & Livelihoods Development Corporation.

Gehlot announced Rajiv Gandhi E-Content scheme under which lectures will be uploaded online and could be accessed by all college students. “This will help students, especially from the economically weaker sections, in understanding the subjects better,” Gehlot said in the assembly.

As a refinery has been established in the state and to improve research in natural gases, MBM Engineering College, Jodhpur, will be upgraded as a university. For this, Rs 20 crore has been sanctioned by the government in the Budget. MBM college is the oldest in the state.

Siddhi Kamte (20) fell off Hadsar Fort from a height of 350 feet

THANE/PUNE: Siddhi Kamte, a 20-year-old trekker from Saat Rasta , died after falling off a cliff during a trekking expedition at Hadsar Fort in Pune district on Wednesday.

Siddhi, a commerce student of a Mumbai-based college and a native of Pune, was an avid trekker. Her family said she left home to accompany a group of around 35 trekkers on Tuesday.

She was part of the group at Hadsar Fort, which is located around 13km from Shivneri Fort, when she reportedly lost her balance and fell off a height of 350 feet, said a member of the rescue team. “The incident took place around 10am on Wednesday when the group members were climbing the fort to conduct a cleanliness drive on reaching the top to mark the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. While trekking, Siddhi lost her balance and fell from a height of more than 350 feet,” said an officer from Junnar police station.

The college student was taken to a nearby hospital with the help of local residents, rescuers and police personnel, where she was declared brought dead, said an officer.

Siddhi, who is survived by her mother, a widow, and younger sister, had taken to trekking a few years back.

Her family said she was shy by nature but would light up whenever she was allowed to go for treks.

She lost her father at a young age and aspired to be a chartered accountant to support her family.

“Siddhi had recently celebrated her birthday and we were shocked to hear of the mishap. I rushed to the hospital after I was alerted of the fall and never expected that the young life could be snuffed out this soon,” said her uncle Sudhir from her native place in Fursungi, Pune.

Meanwhile, trekkers have called in for more safety measures for those undertaking expeditions. It may be noted that the Thane district administration is considering a drone survey to track all treacherous routes for trekkers. The survey, said officials, will be used to understand the danger spots and suggest safer alternatives to ensure lives are not lost to similar mishaps.

PUNE: The corporation will work in coordination with the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority on the proposed extension of Metro routes, connecting the core city areas with the outskirts.

The elected representatives have proposed the extension of Metro on different stretches measuring 100km. The proposals include extending the service up to Wagholi, Khadakwasla, Hadapsar and Warje. At present, work has been initiated on three Metro routes — Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation to Swaragte, Vanaz to Ramwadi (both being executed by MahaMetro) and Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar (executed by the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority).

Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said preliminary talks would be initiated with the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) on the proposals and on how expenses for drafting the detailed project reports (DPR) of these routes could be shared to prevent complications. He said the Metro would play a vital role in strengthening the public transport in the Pune region in the days to come. Proper planning should be done after considering the requirements for the next three decades, he said.

The civic administration has given its go-ahead for the DPR (detailed project report) of Swargate-Katraj extension, but it has received many other proposals for the extension of the Metro services in the past one year. “The proposals are from all over the city. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s standing committee has given approval for preparation of DPRs of various routes. But mere approval to proposals will not be enough. The civic body will have to appoint an agency and make adequate provision of funds to carry out the studies,” a senior corporator said.

Sources claimed that the possibility of appointing a single agency to prepare a collective DPR of new routes was being explored. For instance, studies of the proposed extension of Metro up to Katraj, Chandni Chowk and Nigdi were being studied by MahaMetro, the sources added.

Hadapsar MLA and NCP’s city unit chief Chetan Tupe said the Metro extension proposals were discussed during the recent meeting conducted by district guardian minister Ajit Pawar. The minister sought a detail study of every route, Tupe said.

Extension of Metro up to areas like Hadapsar and Wagholi was essential, the MLA said.

It was now the responsibility of the PMC, PMRDA and MahaMetro to work in coordination to expedite the studies, Tupe said.

274,['21/02/2020'],Cops issue advisory to warn buyers against online fraud,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Visakhapatnam: As an increasing number of residents in the city fall prey to fake advertisements on online classified advertisement platforms, city police have stepped up action to create awareness of cyber fraud.

Hoardings at strategic locations across the city caution residents to be careful before making an online transaction on certain sites and applications.

Explaining the modus operandi behind such cybercrimes, a senior police official said fraudsters pose as army officers or company executives to fool a prospective buyer into believing that the product in the advertisement is being sold at a low price as the seller is moving to another city.

Once the buyer, who hopes to make a purchase at a comparatively low price, is convinced of the ‘genuineness’ of the product, the seller asks him to make an online money transfer. The seller absconds after the money has been transferred.

“It is indeed difficult to verify the genuineness of sellers online. In fact, it becomes difficult for us to trace the fraudsters as they can open a fake profile from any corner of the country. The best way to avoid such a situation is to visit the advertiser and physically verify the product before making any payment,” a police official added.

Most cases of online marketplace fraud, police said, relate to sale of used cars.

“Although our investigations has revealed that these fraudsters are based in other cities, they actually display car pictures that are registered in Visakhapatnam city. Thus victims are convinced that the advertisers are genuine,” the official added.

As precautionary measures, police advise physical verification of the products and checking the original documents and bills for the products before making a payment.

The advisory also states buyers to not trust the identity cards of sellers and other buyers as fraudsters may use fake identity cards which a buyer cannot verify.

VADODARA: After two lawyers and some members of Hindu Jagran Manch entered the heritage Nyay Mandir building to clean it, the Baroda Bar Association (BBA) has now shown its concern for the maintenance of the building.

The president of the lawyers’ body Hasmukh Bhatt wrote a letter addressing it to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chief minister Vijay Rupani, minister of state for home and law and justice Pradipsinh Jadeja and others on Thursday. Bhatt, in his letter, has stated that the Nyay Mandir building was under the possession of the district court administration, but either due to lack of funding from the state government or some other reasons cleanliness is not being taken up inside the premises.

Bhatt also said that either the central government or the state government should take over the building so that the importance of the building be maintained. He also wrote that the structure built during the times of Maharaja Sayajirao III is the pride of people.

Meanwhile, the talking point at the district court in Diwalipura remained the FIR that was registered against the two lawyers – Neeraj Jain and Prakash Jha – for entering the building on February 16 for cleaning it. The WhatsApp groups also remained abuzz with chatter over the issue. “This is a heritage structure and there are penalties prescribed in the Heritage Conservation and Preservation Act for neglect or violation of the act,” said senior advocate Kishor Kini. He also said, “If we talk about Swachh Bharat mission then it is the district collector’s duty to make sure that this public building is kept clean.”

Dr Prashant Upadhyay

VADODARA: The priest of Shri Baglamukhi Brahmastra Vidya Mandir Dr Prashant Upadhyay is on run not only to evade arrest in the recent cases of cheating and criminal intimidation, but also to avoid appearing in a trial of a case registered against him and six others in 2015.

Upadhyay and his aides had thrashed an insurance agent Pragnesh Shah at his temple in Warasia in August 2015.

Shah had once gone to the temple to offer prayers as his relationship with his wife had soured and they were living separately. He was advised by Upadhyay to divorce his wife.

Upadhyay promised to get him married to anyone of his woman followers and was asked to transfer the ownership of his house to the temple trust. However, Shah was not convinced by the idea. A month later, when Shah was passing by the same temple, another priest of the temple asked him to attend a mass sermon at Gotri. Shah was forcibly taken where he had asked questions related to Ramayan and human virtues which were not taken in a good taste.

Next day, Upadhyay called Shah to express his displeasure about the questions and asked him to come over. On August 10, 2015, when Shah went to meet Upadhyay with his friend, an argument ensued and Upadhyay’s aides thrashed him with sticks injuring him.

Shah had then registered a complaint of assault and criminal intimidation at City police station.

The police completed investigation within a month and had filed chargesheet against Upadhyay, his aides Harshal alias Hari Om Mistry, Kinjal Vyas, Dharmesh Vyas, Annama George, Rashmika Upadhyay and Unnati Joshi.

A court of additional chief judicial magistrate has been issuing summons to the accused to appear before the court but in last over four years the case has hardly moved. On Thursday too, the case was listed but as no accused appeared the court adjourned the hearing for April 15.

The vault project is a continuation of the National Film Heritage Mission

PUNE: The National Film Archive of India (NFAI) plans to begin constructing its newest vaults at its Kothrud Phase-II campus. Officials have confirmed that besides celluloid and other film reels, focus will also be on ‘born-digital’ films, tapes, and non-film cinema material.

Over the past year, NFAI has consulted with a number of experts and institutions, including Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B) and Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), to come up with a concrete policy to help create the infrastructure needed to store vast volumes of digital content.

The new vault project is a continuation of the National Film Heritage Mission (NFHM), which is being carried out by the NFAI as the nodal agency. “We had sent the concept project report for the vault construction to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting for approval in December. Once the approval arrives, the construction will take two years to complete. We have also brought an architect on board for the planning and construction,” said NFAI director Prakash Magdum.

He added that, once approved, the vaults will be constructed by public sector entity National Buildings Construction Corporation Limited (NBCC).

At the vaults, the NFAI has planned facilities to store celluloid reels as well as magnetic tape formats like U-Matic and VHS, which were one of the preludes to digital cinema.

But emphasis has also been laid on ‘born digital’ cinema, where films are shot, produced and distributed as digital cinema packages.

“Storage for born digital material does not take up too much physical space but there needs to be relevant infrastructure and technical support to maintain the facility. Besides celluloid and paper material, we will also have infrastructure to store magnetic tape formats like U-Matic, BETA tapes, and VHS,” Magdum said.

“These formats helped in the transition to the digital formats as they exist now,” Magdum stated.

284,['21/02/2020'],AMC’s parking policy lacks planning,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Tuesday approved a parking policy for private and commercial vehicles with a view to increase its revenue and to streamline traffic movement. However, with AMC’s garbage vehicles being parked on roads since the last five months due to lack of parking space, the policy seems impractical.

According to the resolution passed by the municipal corporation, four-wheelers and heavy vehicles will be charged for parking based on the width of the road.

The roads having width between 60 and 24 m are included in A category, the roads having width between 24 to 18 m fall into the B category bracket whereas those have width between 18 and 9 come under the C category.

The resolution proposes night parking charges at Nirala Bazar, Aurangapura, Railway Station Road, Gopal T point, Kranti Chowk, Pundalik Nagar, Connaught Place, Town Hall, TV Centre, Jalgaon Road, Cidco N-1 and Adalat Road.An agency will likely be hired to collect the parking charges. The charges may differ from Rs 5 to Rs 100 per day.

The policy, however, fails to explain as to how the municipal corporation will allot parking spaces on roads when they are already used by citizens for parking their vehicles. Traffic police ACP Dinesh Kolhe said that the AMC needs to assign parking spaces so that the traffic police can ensure that the vehicles are parked in their designated spots.

According to Aparna Thete, who heads the estate department of the AMC, the work on identifying specified parking spaces in city is underway. It is jointly being carried out by the estate, town planning and garden department of the AMC.

285,['21/02/2020'],Mumbai: Indrani Mukerjea’s bail plea opposed for fifth time,"This story is from February 21, 2020

File photo of Indrani Mukerjea

MUMBAI: Opposing Indrani Mukerjea ’s fifth bail plea in the murder case of her daughter Sheena Bora , the prosecution told the special trial court on Thursday that her role is entirely different from co-accused and ex-husband Peter Mukerjea, who was recently granted bail by the Bombay high court. Among her bail arguments, Indrani had sought parity with Peter.

Refuting this, special public prosecutor Manoj Chaladan cited a paragraph from the high court’s February 6 order. The high court had observed that even if were presumed that Peter had shown disapproval to the “love relationship” between his son Rahul Mukerjea and Sheena, there was material to infer that such disapproval was based on the directions of Indrani. The high court had further observed that the material on record demonstrated that the disappearance of Sheena was even suppressed from Peter, as, after the murder Indrani was operating the victim’s email account and mobile phone.

However, one of the defence advocates in the case pointed out that at the end of the same order, the high court had said, “It is made clear, that the observations made herein are prima facie, and the trial court shall decide the case on its own merits, in accordance with law, uninfluenced by the observations made in this order.” The high court had stayed its order by six weeks to enable an appeal by the CBI.

Seeking bail, Indrani had cited the deposition of several witnesses and said that their versions were concocted and riddled with discrepancies. However, Chaladan said that at this stage the court cannot go into the credibility and reliability of witnesses. “It can only look at if there are reasonable grounds or not,” the prosecutor said.

The prosecution also said that witnesses such as Indrani’s former driver and accused-turned-approver, Shyamvar Rai, former assistant Kajal Sharma and son Mekhail Bora had spoken about her role in various aspects of the crime. “The prosecution had got prima facie material to show the active role of the accused and how grave the offence is,” Chaladan said. He also said that there was apprehension that Indrani would abscond as she was a British citizen. Standing in the witness box, Indrani quipped that her passport was with the court.

Concluding his submissions, Chaladan said, “Considering the gravity of the offence, role of the accused, status of accused in society…the accused is not entitled for bail at this stage.”

Indrani will submit her rejoinder to the prosecution’s arguments on February 25.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad Cantonment ’s long wait for anganwadis under the central government’s Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme is set to end soon.

The district women and child development office has proposed to the state government for setting up of 13 anganwadis in the Aurangabad Cantonment. This development comes after the activists from an NGO filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court seeking the establishment of anganwadis in the cantonment.

In the PIL filed in November 2019, the activists of Cantonment Jan Adhikar Manch (CJAM) had sought the establishment of anganwadis in the Aurangabad Cantonment. Laxman Deshmukh, one of the petitioners, said that they had to take the course of PIL as there is not a single anganwadi in Aurangabad Cantonment which houses 25,000 registered voters. The court had issued a notice to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) among other government establishments in this regard.

Abhay Rathod, on the behalf of the petitioners, said that the anganwadis are established under the National Policy for Children, 2013, which protects the fundamental rights of children.

In the hearing held on January 29, the bench comprising justice SV Gangapurwala and justice Shrikant D Kulkarni had asked the women and child development department to conduct a survey within 10 days to explore suitable places for establishing anganwadis.

When asked, Pramod Yendole, child development project officer, Aurangabad-Urban A, said that following a survey, it has been decided that 13 anganwadis should be established in the Aurangabad Cantonment. “Last month, the central government had approved 97 new anganwadis for Maharashtra. We have proposed to the state women and child welfare department for the approval of 13 anganwadis for Aurangabad Cantonment out of these 97 new anganwadis. We expect an approval by next week,” Yendole said.

291,['21/02/2020'],Passengers continue to suffer as auto drivers refuse to ply my meter,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Aurangabad: The regional transport office ( RTO ) has not been able to deal with the problem of autorickshaw drivers plying in the city without meters.

Though it is mandatory for rickshaws plying on city roads to have a functional meter installed and charge the passengers according to it, not many auto drivers abide by this rule.

Owing to this, passengers are forced to pay an exorbitant amount every time they hire an autorickshaw. According to a Jawahar Colony resident, Sonia Doke, there is absolutely no rule of law prevalent in rickshaw business in the city.

“You either agree to pay whatever the auto drivers ask for or use your own vehicle. For areas within city for example from Cidco N-4 to Mill Corner they charge as high as Rs 150 during the day,” she said.

According to meter, one has to pay Rs 14 per kilometer, but the auto drivers in the city are charging a minimum fare of Rs 30.

Regional transport officer Satish Sadamate said the RTO has a record of 9,920 auto rickshaws that have a valid permit and functional meters.

“In a meeting held with commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad two days ago, it was decided that all these rickshaws will display a sticker that would help us identify that they have clear papers, a working meter and are displaying the mandatory information on the vehicle. The traffic police will work with the RTO to ensure that authorised stickers are distributed to the auto drivers,” he said.

He added that the only 15 days ago, the RTO undertook a drive during which 62 rickshaws were found to be plying on road without proper papers or working meters. These vehicles were seized by the RTO.

Meanwhile, Nisar Ahmed Khan of Rickshaw Chalak Sanyukt Sangharsh Kruti Mahasangh said rising inflation along with surge in diesel and petrol prices makes it difficult for auto drivers to charge as per meter rates.

“We have placed several memorandums of demand before the RTO and the road transport ministry asking them to increase the rates, but our demands have not been heard,” Ahmed said.

Aurangabad: After successful implementation of Happy Streets on February 16, the Times of India’s initiative will now be held on February 23 from 6 am to 9 am in front of the Times of India office.

The initiative is getting overwhelming response and queries regarding the event have already started pouring in.

Giving a break to heavy traffic from Osmanpura Circle to Kranti Chowk, the stretch is made free from vehicular traffic for three hours under the Happy Streets initiative. The event is being organised by the Times of India and Maharashtra Times in association with the Aurangabad city police.

The annual event is an initiative to allow people to enjoy the city roads without the obstruction of vehicular traffic. People of all age groups get a chance to participate in a range of activities. In the previous Happy Streets held on February 16, revellers engaged in physical activities like Zumba dance, aerobics, skating, cycling, cricket and skipping. Children played the board game ‘snakes and ladders.’ The game was recreated in a unique way with children and grown-ups playing as pawns on a mega board placed on the road. Some preferred to play carom during the event.

Those having an artistic inclination expressed their talent through nail art, face painting, abstract painting, canvas painting and rangoli. In the musical stand, professional singers as well as common people sang songs and played music from different genres. Revellers recorded sweet moments of the event on their mobile phones by clicking selfies at the selfie stand. Young and elderly alike made the most of the event’s colourful and cheerful milieu.

All this and more is planned for the forthcoming editions of Happy Streets to be held on February 23 and March 1, organisers said.

Vijayawada: After a long wait, the endowments department of the Andhra Pradesh state government issued orders constituting the trust board for Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla Devastanams, in the city. Following a stiff competition, 15 members secured a place in the temple trust board. The endowments department issued orders constituting non-hereditary members for the trust board.

Senior YSRCP leader Paila Sominaidu, Katakam Sridevi, DVRK Prasad, Busireddy Subbayamma, Puli Chandrakala, OV Ramana, Ganta Prasada Rao, Rachamallu Siva Prasada Reddy, Chakka Vara Lakshmi, Karthika Rajya Lakshmi, Netikoppula Sujatha, N Ambika, Kanugula Venkata Ramana, Nerusu Satish, Bandaru Jyothi were appointed as members of the temple trust board.

Temple chief priest LD Prasad was appointed as an ex-officio member of the trust board. The trustees will hold office for two years from the day of taking the oath.

Meanwhile, the chairman for the trust board is yet to be announced.

A few aspirants from the city who expected a place in the trust board were unhappy with the orders issued, which gave a place for non-locals.

Hindu associations welcomed the appointments and asked the newly elected trustees to respect the sentiments of the devotees. The trust board constituted during the Telugu Desam tenure was involved in some major controversies.

AHMEDABAD: For non-English users of internet, the content consists of less than half of searchable indexed data. “But for a large population not speaking English , it could be a barrier while attempting to access the world,” said Prasenjit Majumder, associate professor with DAIICT .

“For example, a Gujarati native speaker will not have much option vis-a-vis English.”

As International Mother Language Day, celebrated annually on February 21, will be marked with theme of ‘Languages without Borders,’ the team led by Prof Majumder at Information Retrieval Lab attempts to bridge the gap between Indian languages — especially Gujarati — and concepts such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.

The team from DAIICT has already tasted success in analysis of tweets and online content in Gujarati and has started work on Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Gujarati in collaboration with IITs. The researchers said that compared to English, it’s difficult to work with language like Gujarati. “NLP tools for Indian languages have not yet reached that level because of lack of annotated data and lexical resources. Majority of Indian languages are highly inflected languages due to which many of the techniques used for English do not work here,” said a researcher. Citing an example, the team members said that Indian names do not have capital letters to denote a name, making it difficult for system to recognize one in data.“Language longevity will be decided by their online presence in time to come. Once the systems for regional languages are developed, features such as audio input, predictive texting, etc. could be developed. But it requires multi-pronged approach involving programmers, linguists, lexicographers and so on,” said Prof Majumder. Experts point at a phenomenal rise in regional content with cheaper internet and better online tools for translation and input - factors which have enabled an entire generation to use social media and platforms such as WhatsApp without knowledge of English.

VADODARA: A mob of 200 to 300 persons was booked for rioting and other offences as they vandalized as a traffic police cabin and got into a melee with policemen following a fatal accident at Susen circle in Tarsali on Vadsar road on Wednesday morning.

According to police, as a dumping truck ran over Bansi Surti (65) on Wednesday morning, a large group of people had blocked the road and had started thrashing the truck driver. When the traffic assistant sub-inspector Ashok Ramanbhai intervened and locked up the driver in the police cabin to save him from public wrath, the cabin was vandalized. The traffic cop called for more police as the mob swelled.

Even as more number of policemen reached the spot, the agitators got into melee with an inspector and even hurt a lok rakshak dal personnel. The traffic cop stated in his complaint that the mob even made attempts to torch the truck but when they were stopped, some persons pelted stones and damaged its windshield. An unidentified man also showed cash at cops and asked if they wanted more money, the complaint stated.

Later, as senior police officials and additional force reached, the crowd was dispersed and the road was cleared for traffic. An offence of rioting, deterring public servant from performing duty and criminal intimidation was registered. Police said that two persons – Jayesh Darji and Ajay Patel – have been identified from the mob.

Surti, a resident of Makarpura , was mowed down by the truck when he was on his way to his brother’s home near Nava Bazaar.

Pune: Creaticity , Pune’s one-of its-kind furniture and home-decor mall housing over 15 brands furniture brands under one-roof, has completed right-sizing its business to enable it to grow its revenue.

The mall, formerly known as Ishanya — when it was concentrated with largely only furniture brands, has now realigned itself to have 50% of the space dedicated to home décor and furniture, 20% of the space to food and beverages and entertainment , and the balance to office space. This has given Creaticity a very healthy 84% occupancy levels.

Resultantly, the company’s revenues have grown to about Rs 24 crore in the current fiscal from about Rs 14.5 crore two years ago when it rebranded itself. “The rise in income is a result of right-sizing…there have been only 2-3 exits but seven new additions in the last two years. Some brands have also right-sized,” Mahesh, CEO, Creaticity, said.

TimesView Law enforcement has been crowdsourced. This was inevitable, given the kind of traffic Bengaluru deals with and the issues caused by the limited number of police personnel on roads. While it might be satisfying to film an offender committing an egregious breach of traffic laws and endangering people, it’s not a healthy development. It may have short-term benefits, but it could lead to other forms of citizen justice — which is not far from mob rule. Long-term solutions would be more investment in the police department, better training and traffic planning. But while people bemoan the state of law enforcement, funding for police departments is always hard to come by.

BENGALURU: The trend of citizens turning watchdogs is growing in Bengaluru. The number of complaints lodged by law-abiding citizens against traffic offenders on the PublicEye app witnessed a 150 per cent year-on-year increase in 2019.PublicEye, an initiative launched by traffic police and Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship Democracy five years ago, allows citizens to click photographs of traffic violations and report them to police. If the photographic submission, in which the vehicle’s registration number is visible, is corroborated with supporting evidence, the offender will be penalised.While the number of complaints reported on PublicEye was 13,803 in 2015, it increased to 60,738 in 2018 and crossed 1,52,000 in 2019. This translates into an average of 417 complaints registered every day. “This is a pointer to increased citizen participation in policing. Bengalureans are becoming more vigilant on the roads,” said joint commissioner (traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda.The most common violations include riding without a helmet, parking in the wrong place, riding in the opposite direction on a one-way stretch, riding on footpaths and jumping traffic signals.But why has the number of complaints shots up drastically in 2019? Ravikanthe Gowda attributed it to the increased social media presence of traffic police. “Interest in traffic-related issues has gone up. People find it easy to access police on social media as we have amplified our presence on digital platforms,” he said.Another factor is the growing public contempt for traffic offenders. “A majority of vehicle users prefer to follow traffic rules even if they are caught in a jam instead of taking short-cuts like riding on pavements. When someone brazenly violates traffic rules, fellow motorists capture them on camera. Tolerance for rule-breakers is thinning in the city,” another police officer said.However, challans are not raised with regard to all complaints reported on PublicEye. In 2019, police rejected 27 per cent (40,329) of the complaints registered. “If the violation is found to be valid after appropriate checks by police, the offender is penalised as per the prescribed fine regime. For the offence to be considered valid, the vehicle registration number and violation committed should be visible in the complaint. For example, no parking board should be seen in a photograph which reports a no-parking violation. If the complaint doesn’t meet the required parameters, it’s rejected.

Rusty mountain: Unclaimed vehicles piled on top of each other near the regional transport authority office in ... Read More

HYDERABAD: Open areas near many regional transport authority ( RTA ) offices have turned into mass garages for vehicles that have remained unclaimed by their owners, in some cases, for over a decade.

These mounting piles of unclaimed vehicles are eating up open spaces which otherwise could have been used as parking spaces for vehicles of those who visit these offices. Instead, these unclaimed vehicles of which many have rusted bodies, occupy the spaces as people prefer not to take them even after cases against them have been settled.

During a visit to Trimulgherry RTA office, TOI found many auto rickshaws, cars and other vehicles piled on top of each other, all gathering dust. Similar was the case in Nagole where vehicles were left abandoned in an open space opposite Balaji temple. RTA officials are supposed to conduct an auction if the vehicle is not claimed, however, in most cases they fail to even send a notice to the owner.

“The RTA cannot keep vehicles for years together. They have to dispose them through auction or by sending a notice to the owner for release of these vehicles. If the owner does not pay the penalty, the department must take action as per Motor Vehicle Act,” said Telangana Auto and Motor Welfare Union general secretary, M Dayanand.

The Act states that the department should give a notification in the newspaper saying that on a given date, the vehicle will be put up for auction. “After the notice is given, a tender officer will be appointed to conduct the auction which will be organised in the presence of the public. This should be the process but because the RTA is not sending notices, the vehicles are gathering rust and just lying in open spaces for several years,” said Dayanand.

When contacted, joint transport commissioner C Ramesh said: “We have sent notices to owners and it is in process. The vehicles will be disposed in auction if they don’t come forward to claim them.”

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Continuing its upward rally, gold prices breached the Rs 43,000-mark to touch a new record high and settle at Rs 43,205 per 10 gram in the Ahmedabad market on Thursday.

Pure gold price in Ahmedabad remained the second-highest in India, while the highest price being in the Hyderabad market, at Rs 43,250 per 10 gram.

The yellow metal prices rose in the international market, on account of growing concerns over the impact of the widespread coronavirus infection in China.

“Gold prices jumped by Rs 335 per 10 gram in the Ahmedabad market. Imports and exports of various countries including India is dependent on China and therefore, the extension of vacation in China due to the coronavirus infection would have an impact on global economy. Gold prices have shot up as a result of this in the international market,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers' Association (IBJA).

Overall gold prices have remained above the Rs 42,000-mark as a result of which the demand has showed a significant deceleration. “Gold jewellery demand has significantly declined due to high prices of gold. There was no relief provided to jewellers even during the Union Budget in the form of cut on basic customs duty. If prices continue to remain high, sales of jewellery as well as bullion is expected to decline and will impact employment in the sector,” said Acharya.

Despite the ongoing wedding season, high gold prices pushed gold imports in Gujarat to a five-month low at 0.92 metric tonne (MT).

“Due to the Kamurta period, which is often considered inauspicious for gold purchases, coupled with high prices, gold imports plunged significantly low in January,” said a city-based jeweller.

“More than 70% transactions are being made through exchange of old gold. The ongoing wedding season is keeping sales upbeat as of now but if the prices continue to remain high,it may deter customers from purchase,” said Manoj Soni, member, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA).

PANAJI: Director of urban development Tariq Thomas has appointed deputy director Deepesh Priolkar to conduct an inquiry into the complaint that a commercial project at Aquem, which was granted ‘part occupancy ’ certificate by Margao Municipal Council (MMC) in 2019, stood on wetland.

Thomas issued the order on Thursday following a fresh complaint by Margao resident Shirish Kamat.

Priolkar has been ordered to inspect the site while the chief officer at MMC has been asked to offer necessary assistance such as deployment of engineers and staff to assist him.

In his earlier order issued recently on an appeal filed by Kamat, the urban development director had kept in abeyance the part occupancy certificate that was issued until further orders.

As requested by the vigilance department, the inquiry has to be completed within ten days.

In his earlier complaint, Kamat had pointed out that there is no such provision in the law to issue any such thing called 'part occupancy' and that the certificate issued by MMC wasn't as per format specified in the Goa Land and Development Building Construction Regulation 2010.

HYDERABAD: The water quality in Osmansagar dam across the Musi river has deteriorated over the years. The reservoir, which turned 100 this year, is polluted with discharge from industrial and residential units whose activities have been on the rise over the past decade. It serves as a source of drinking water for a sizeable population but contamination — chemical, industrial and biological — in the Musi river has taken a heavy toll on the health of this water body.According to a recent research, the water quality index (WQI) of Osmansagar was recorded at 52.84 — just a shade above the “bad” category. While a WQI of between 50 to 70 falls under the “medium” category, the quality of Osmansagar is barely two notches above the bad category due to presence of pollutants.Another study published in the International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering (IJRTE) reveals that, of the 16 water quality parameters, the Osmansagar passed the test in only parameter — pertaining to pH levels. Under the other 15 categories, waters of the Osmansagar fall under the “undesirable” category. The water is said to contain coliform indicating contamination by human discharge.Furthermore, analysis of the water collected from Osmansagar by the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) since 2011 shows that only twice — in 2017 and 2019 — had it passed the dissolved oxygen (DO) test. DO is an essential requirement for survival for aquatic life. The water also fails the test when it comes to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which determines the availability of oxygen for living species. The levels often ranges between 6 to 10. A BOD level below 3.5 is deemed desirable.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has put Osmansagar under “B” category which means the water is fit for outdoor bathing but not for drinking unless treated through conventional means. Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board’s (HMWS&SB) general manager for quality assurance and testing, J Sunil Kumar claims that while treated water from the reservoir is 99% safe, in its raw form, the water is highly turbid with high levels of biological and chemical contaminants. “We remove all pollutants during the conventional treatment and ensure only safe drinking water is supplied through taps,” Sunil Kumar told TOI.While a drinking water source should not contain any faecal coliform bacteria, analysis of Osmansagar water shows a coliform count ranging between 15 to 378. In terms of total coliform bacteria, the water body had a minimum if 41 to maximum of 1,350 as per TSPCB data. The count should be nil. However, the water can be consumed after thorough treatment. “We have been carrying tests covering all parameters every month. Our analysis shows that Osmansagar water is potable but after treatment as it falls under ‘B’ category. Only category ‘A’ water can be consumed without conventional treatment but after disinfection,” TSPCB consultant senior scientist, N Murali Mohan told TOI.The study published in IJRTE shows that as far as pH levels of surface water is concerned, water from Osmansagar does not require treatment. The pH value was recorded at 7.55 which falls within the permissible range of 6.5 to 8.5 for drinking water. However another study by scholars Akhil Gurijala, SS Asadi, and D Satish Chandra, shows that the water has high odour when drinking water should have agreeable odour. The total hardness of surface water was reported to be 801mg per litre as against the permissible range of 200 to 600 mg per litre.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74234573,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-133548,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ageing-bad-100-year-old-osmansagar-rippling-with-pollutants/articleshow/74233246.cms

AURANGABAD: A 21-year-old youth was stabbed to death following a dispute over a flag in the procession to mark Shiv Jayanti in the city on Wednesday.

The Pundaliknagar police on Thursday arrested a 24-year-old man for allegedly stabbing the youth, who had refused to lend his flag to two suspects during the procession at around 9 pm on Wednesday.

Assistant police inspector Ghanshyam Sonwane, in charge of the Pundaliknagar police station, said Shrikant Gopichand Shinde, of Hussain Colony in Garkheda, was carrying a huge flag in a small procession that was on its way to join the main procession in the city.

Two people — identified as Rahul Bhosale (22) and Vijay Vaidya (24) — approached Shinde and asked him to hand over the flag to them for some time. Shinde refused. This led to heated arguments, following which, Bhosale allegedly drew out a knife and stabbed Shinde in the chest and stomach. Bhosale and Vaidya then fled the scene.

For a while, people participating in the procession could not fathom what had transpired. Some youths accompanying Shinde alerted his father, who rushed to the spot and took his son to a nearby private hospital. Shinde, however, was declared dead.

Sonwane said the police had immediately pressed four teams into action and had arrested Vaidya from the Karmad area, about 25 km from the city, early on Thursday. Vaidya has some previous cases against him. The police have now sent teams to look for Bhosale.

Meanwhile, the Pundaliknagar residents resorted to an agitation demanding the immediate arrest of the suspects. Meenatai Gayake, the Shiv Sena corporator from the area, said initially the residents were reluctant to take Shinde’s body. However, after one suspect was arrested, the relatives took the body and the youth’s last rites were performed, she said.

BENGALURU: With the government being informed about President Ram Nath Kovind’s Friday visit to Bengaluru only four days earlier, transport officials went on a spree collecting government vehicles, especially SUVs and jeeps, for deployment in the presidential convoy.In all, 150 government vehicles were picked up on Tuesday and Wednesday, and several officials were in for a shock with their vehicles being taken away without prior notice.However, not all 150 vehicles will be used for the President’s convoy, sources said. “Thirty vehicles will be used to ferry officials and police in the President’s convoy. Officials from the enforcement department will inspect the vehicles, check their condition and select 30,” they added.In its order on February 17, the department of personnel and administrative reforms said around 15 vehicles from each government department should be taken away by February 19. Accordingly, inspectors from the 10 RTOs were told to ‘swiftly collect’ the vehicles.In several instances, RTO officials literally whisked away the vehicles, leaving the officials whom they were allotted to and their drivers shocked. A driver from a government department told TOI he was flagged down near Palace Guttahalli and his vehicle was driven away by officials. He and the officer he was ferrying had to take an autorickshaw to reach office.“I was ferrying the officer to which the vehicle has been allotted after dropping some other officials at Vidhana Soudha. RTO officials stopped our vehicle and asked us and to take an auto. They showed us a notice from the enforcement department. Left with no choice, we stepped down and boarded an auto,” said the driver.An RTO official confirmed they had driven away several vehicles from the middle of the road. “We had no choice. Please don’t think we enjoy doing this. Some officials threatened us with action for taking away their vehicle. We were running out of time and hence, we forced them to hand it over,” an official said.Another expressed dismay over the development, saying there should be a proper way to arrange for vehicles during VIP visits. “Bengaluru hosts VIPs every now and then. There is no harm in the government reserving around 50 vehicles for such purposes. For 30-40 years, we have been following the same method of hurriedly collecting vehicles, ” he said.Transport commissioner N Shivakumar did not respond to calls and messages.

Aurangabad: The menace of haphazard and unauthorised parking of vehicles on roads across the city is affecting movement of vehicular traffic and pedestrians alike.

Lack of parking space provided by marriage halls, hotels and commercial establishments is just adding to the problem and authorities have failed to deal with this issue in an effective manner.

Service lanes along important roads like Jalna Road, Jalgaon Road and Beed Bypass, meant for local residents and commercial visitors, are plagued with the issue of unauthorised parking. In addition, the market areas of Nirala Bazar, Aurangapura, Gulmandi, City Chowk and Pundalik Nagar also witness haphazard parking by motorists all day long.

Though traffic police and Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) claim to be serious about dealing with this menace, nothing concrete has been done by them so far.

According to Avinash Salve, an engineering student, there is major lack of awareness among the general people about traffic rules and regulations.

“The authorities concerned should put up boards and LED displays asking people to follow traffic regulations. Implementation of rules should be stricter so that there is a fear among errant motorists,” Salve said.

Aam Aadmi Party district convener Sugriv Munde, who led a campaign against a public sector bank for provision of parking space for visitors, said the civic body should see to it that commercial establishments have parking space before giving them building permission.

According to the AMC’s town planning department official RS Mahajan, the civic body approves the building plan only if there is a provision for parking.

“We cannot say about the old buildings, but all newly-approved buildings have provisions for parking space,” he said.

Visakhapatnam: Minister of municipal administration and urban development Botcha Satyanarayana said that the detailed project report (DPR) for the metro rail project is ready and the project office would shortly start work in Vizag. A budget of around Rs Rs 1,000 crore has been allocated for the project, the minister said, and added that the project has been extended to Bhogapuram.

The minister reviewed smart city projects, the metro rail and other projects at the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) office here on Thursday.

Satyanarayana also held reviews of summer action plans for drinking water and housing projects with the municipal commissioners of north Andhra and East Godavari districts at the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) office, along with principal secretary J Syamala Rao.

A pipeline from the Godavari river to Vizag city would be laid for round-the-clock water supply, the minister said. “We have already initiated an action plan for drinking water in the summer in all 56 municipalities in the state. We have reviewed the issue keeping in mind water scarcity in summer. A review with officials of Rayalaseema districts would be held very soon,” he said.

As part of its election promise, the government would provide 300 sq ft houses free of cost and bank loans would be provided for purchasing 365 sq ft and 430 sq ft houses, the minister said.

Altogether 41,462 applications were received for the building plan regularisation scheme in the state, the minister said, of which 13,778 applications are from north Andhra and East Godavari districts.

Around 54 per cent of applications have been approved, two per cent rejected, 33 per cent are pending and 11 per cent are being processed. The government would also take action against illegal layouts, he said.

Hyderabad: Devotees were gearing up to head to Keerseragutta in the outskirts of the city on Thursday, ahead of Mahashivratri. Several devotees had planned on staying overnight to get an early darshan. “I have come to purchase flowers for tomorrow as I do not want to leave this for the last minute,” said Revathi Reddy, who was spotted at a local market in Domalguda.

Swathi Rao, another city resident, said that she would be heading to her local temple in Sri Nagar colony to seek blessings. On this day, to please the Lord, devotees fast as well as offer fruits and milk to the Shiva lingam. Many women also pray to be blessed with a good husband.

Shivratri marks the night Lord Shiva saved mankind by consuming a pot of poison during Samudra Manthan or the mythical churning of the ocean. Within the city, temples in SPR Hills in Motinagar and Shankar mutt at Nallakunta were among several that wore a festive look ahead of celebrations.

Shivratri celebrations also began at Vemulawada in Rajana Sircilla district on Thursday. The state has planned massive celebrations in Vemulawada as well as Siddipet this year.

Vehicles parked on a footpath in Whitefield.

BENGALURU: A bad-tempered protest against motorists who illegally park in public spaces or reserved spots has usually involved deflating the car tyres or scratching the paint. On Thursday, a Whitefield resident registered his/her annoyance in a very different fashion: the person stuck condoms on the windshields of a few cars and left a note with some cutting commentary.

“You park like an A******. Please don’t reproduce,” read the message for the parking offenders .

Locals and Whitefield traffic police, who struggled a bit to hide their amusement, said two to three cars parked on a pavement of Whitefield Main Road, behind General Electric Digital Bangalore hub in Hoodi, were targeted.

Anjali Saini, a local resident, said cars carelessly parked on sidewalks and even on the road were a major irritant in the area. “The area lacks planning when it comes to parking zones and open spaces. Civic and government agencies must enforce the rules strictly to prevent illegal parking,” she said. Saini added she had no idea who could be behind Thursday’s stunt.

Banaswadi resident Vinay Nambiar posted pictures of the stuck condoms and the note on Facebook. He clarified he didn’t resort to this form of protest, but said it was normal in the West to shame irresponsible vehicle owners this way.

“I hope what has happened in Whitefield is an eye-opener, and motorists realise that they cannot leave their cars on pavements, which is meant for pedestrians,” he said.

In 2019, traffic police recorded over 10.8 lakh parking-zone violations across the city. In January this year, 66,664 cases were registered.

“There’s not enough space for parking in ITPL. Commercial establishments like restaurants also don’t provide parking to their customers. So, most people leave their rides on footpaths of Whitefield Main Road and ITPL Main Road,” said an officer with the traffic police. “We tow vehicles away, but it doesn’t the desired impact.”

A senior official said a traffic subdivision would be started in Whitefield this year. The proposed division will have four to six police stations and over 100 personnel. Currently, Whitefield and nearby areas are part of the east traffic division.

“We have been demanding a separate traffic division for Whitefield for years now. There have been a number of fatal accidents and pedestrians are forced to walk on the road as pavements are full of parked vehicles. There are not enough traffic police personnel on the ground,” said a member of citizens’ group Whitefield Rising.

VADODARA: Warasia police arrested two aides of temple priest of Shri Baglamukhi Brahmastra Vidya Mandir in connection with a threat complaint filed against him. Police arrested Kiran Chandani and her daughter Pinky Chandani after they got a tip-off about their whereabouts on Thursday.

Temple priest Baglamukhi Prashant Upadhyay, who is the prime accused, is still on the run. Police said they had issued a lookout notice for Upadhyay. Kiran and Pinky were accused of threatening Minaxi Shah, who was a follower of Upadhyay.

According to Shah, her younger son Kalpesh was a follower of Upadhyay and used to go to the temple regularly. In 2006, Kalpesh had asked his elder brother Jignesh to come and attend Upadhyay’s sermons to which the latter refused. Kalpesh, however, continued visiting the temple and spent most of his time there.

Shah told the cops that one day when she went to meet Kalpesh in the temple he was nowhere to be seen. When she asked Upadhyay about her son, he told her that she shouldn’t worry and that Kalpesh will return home soon. Kalpesh didn’t return for many days and Upadhyay began avoiding her.

Shah was told that Kalpesh was working at Upadhyay’s house in Gotri as helper but she couldn’t find him there too. Kalpesh suddenly resurfaced after a decade in 2017. But he again went to Delhi after telling Shah that he will have to spend nine months there. When Kalpesh again went missing, Shah approached Upadhyay who didn’t give her proper answers. She then submitted an application to police.

Shah said that when Upadhyay learned about her move, he started threatening her to withdraw her complaint.

Later, Upadhyay’s two aides Kiran and Pinky came to her house on Warasia Ring Road and threatened her of dire consequences if she spoke ill about the priest.

The woman registered a police complaint against Upadhyay who is already facing probe in a cheating case filed by a businessman.

Ponda Municipal Council chairperson Venkatesh Naik said the Ponda Carnival would be celebrated on February 25 instead of February 23 that was previously finalised, to avoid overlapping of a similar event at a nearby town.

The Carnival parade would follow the same route this year, from Casa Menino to Tisk Ponda, Naik said.

In keeping with tradition of having a different King Momo here, Melvyn Fernandes will lead the parade at Ponda.

Enough margin had not been left out while constructing buildings on the banks of the river, alleges MLA Shaile... Read More

VADODARA: The constructions on the bank of Vishwamitri sparked a row in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) general board meeting on Thursday. Not only the opposition, but the ruling BJP MLA and corporator Shailesh Mehta alias Sotta also raised the issue.

Mehta has been making critical remarks about the state of affairs in the civic body since Wednesday. On Wednesday, he had targeted the civic body over the issue of newly constructed residential schemes not being given water connections despite being occupied and had also raised difficult questions about town planning schemes sent by VMC to the state government not getting approved.

The discussion on Vishwamitri began with leader of opposition Chandrakant Shrivastava alias Bhattu raising the issue of how the purpose of use of green belt land along the river was changed to residential or commercial. Mehta too joined the discussion and questioned such constructions.

Mehta said that enough margin had not been left out while constructing buildings on the banks of the river. He said that this was in clear violation of rules. Mehta said that he had raised the issue even when the permissions for the buildings were given, but nothing was done by the civic body.

He also pointed out that land on the banks that was earmarked for housing schemes for the poor was shown as the location for the Swarnim Garden and then for the crocodile park.

Mehta slammed the administration saying that issues were being raised in the general board, but nothing was done regarding them. He said that the administration should look into the representations and tell the general board members if they were right or wrong.

323,['21/02/2020'],Uttar Pradesh: Retired Allahabad high court judge booked for ‘beating cop at CAA meet’,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Mushaffey Ahmad

PILIBHIT: A retired judge of the Allahabad high court was among 33 people booked for allegedly “assaulting and illegally confining” a police constable during discussions on CAA and NRC held on private premises in Pilibhit on February 13.

Mushaffey Ahmad, who served as a judge in the high court between 2012 and 2013, told TOI that he had not attended the gathering but had counselled some members of the group when they met him the same day to seek advice on how to express their views on CAA and NRC without violating laws.

Police booked the 33 identified individuals and 100 unidentified people under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by public servant), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to public servant), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 342 (wrongful confinement), 506 (criminal intimidation) and section 7 of Criminal Law Amendment Act.

Ahmad said on Thursday that he was “shocked to see my name in the FIR. I wasn’t even present in the meeting. I had met the group and told them that this gathering would be in violation of section 144 of the CrPC that is in force in the district, but that peaceful expression of their views was well within their constitutional rights”.

The 68-year-old also said that he found it “hard to believe” that a constable was assaulted at the meeting and confined overnight. He added, “Suppressing peaceful protests against CAA and NRC is unfortunate for the democratic values of the country as well as the dignity of the Indian constitution.”

He has now approached the chief justice of Allahabad HC and sought a high-level probe into the matter. “Policemen should be booked for falsely implicating me in an FIR. I will also meet the home secretary in this regard.”

Asked if police knew that Ahmad was a retired judge, officiating SHO, Pilibhit Kotwali police station, Mukesh Chand, said, “This can only be answered by the SHO who lodged the FIR. The SHO, Srikant Dwivedi, is on a week-long leave.”

Police stuck to their version that constable Dushyant Kumar was assaulted. A police officer said, “The protesters caught him and thrashed him. They even dragged him to an adjoining house and locked him up before threatening to kill him if he raised an alarm. However, he managed to escape on Friday and reached the police station where he narrated his ordeal.”

Congress district president Harpreet Singh Chaba, Bhim Army district president Atul Valmiki, district in-charge of Rashtriya Kisan Majdoor Sangathan Yusuf Malik and five women were among the 33 people booked for the incident.

Meanwhile, a joint delegation of Swaraj Abhiyan, UP Coordination Committee against CAA, NRC and Samvidhan Rakshak Sabha visited the area on Thursday. Ajit Singh Yadav , a member of Swaraj Abhiyan’s national working committee, alleged that police had lodged a false FIR. “Mohammad Bi whose house Kumar was supposedly dragged into and confined has denied such an incident. She said that her house had CCTVs and the footage can easily reveal the truth.”

326,['21/02/2020'],UPPCB slaps Rs 9 crore fine on seven godown owners for storing animal skin illegally in Moradabad,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Bareilly: Coming down heavily on the godown operators for illegally storing animal skins, triggering air pollution and flouting UPPCB norms, the Pollution Control Board has imposed a hefty penalty of Rs 9.58 crore on seven godown operators in Asalatpura area of UP’s Moradabad. Officials at UPPCB said that during inspections, the godowns were found to be flouting norms and they did lack pollution control system.

Officials at Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board, Moradabad, said that after repeated complaints from local residents regarding illegal operations and foul smell in the residential area, inspections were conducted last year and seven godowns were found to be operating illegally under Galshaheed police station limits. An inquiry was ordered from the headquarters and legal action has now been taken.

Speaking with TOI, UPPCB regional officer Ajay Sharma said, “Earlier, animal skins in huge quantities were recovered from the godowns located in Asalatpura area and initial inspections had also revealed that the operators did not follow the legal procedure. The godowns did not acquire licences or no-objection certificates (NOC) from the pollution control board. A probe was ordered from the Central Pollution Control Board and hefty penalties have now been imposed on the erring godown operators as per NGT guidelines and pollution board norms.”

Sharma added, “A recent inspection of the godowns revealed that cattle skin was being stored in huge quantities. The identified godowns were established in residential areas and were operating against UPPCB’s consent; hence, these were unauthorized. The godowns also did lack mechanism to control pollution and were resulting in contamination of environment.”

The UPPCB has slapped a penalty of Rs 9.58 crore (Rs 1.36 crore each) on godown operators and granted a week’s time to pay the fine; failing which, further legal action will be initiated.

“The district administration has also been asked to restrict operations of the erring godowns. Besides, we have written to the civic authorities and power corporation to disconnect water and power supply to these illegal establishments. The board constantly keeps a tab on the slaughterhouses, godowns registered with UPPCB, to check whether they are flouting norms. The crackdown will continue in the city,” Sharma said.

The Moradabad police had last year launched a major crackdown on people involved in alleged illegal slaughtering of animals under Galshaheed police station, following which, 49 accused persons were arrested. Police had also recovered 117 animals from their possession, including bovines which were kept for slaughter. The police had also recovered meat in large quantity, 12 vehicles and Rs 10 lakh from them.

Vijayawada: Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan asked the state government to lift the criminal cases against capital area farmers for staging protests in front of revenue officials who came for land survey.

“It indicates the autocracy of this government, which is registering cases using different sections of the IPC against farmers who protested in front of revenue officials in Krishnayapalem village under the limits of capital city region. The government is trying to terrorise farmers by foisting cases against 426 people who belong to villages under the limits of the capital city of Amaravati ,” he alleged.

The future of farmers has become uncertain since the announcement of the three capitals proposal, Pawan said, adding that they have been left with no option other than expressing their anger through protests against the government’s decision to distribute lands given by them for building the capital city as house sites to the poor.

Demanding the government withdraw the cases, Pawan said. “The farmers are holding the protests peacefully from day one. The government’s action to file cases without holding talks with them is undemocratic,” he said.

Pawan, who was in Delhi on Thursday, handed over a cheque of Rs 1 crore to the Central Sainik Board which he had announced on the occasion of Armed Forces Flag Day. He also addressed the Indian Students’ Parliament (ISP) at Vigyan Bhavan in the national capital.

329,['21/02/2020'],Region has irrigation backlog of Rs4.5k cr: Experts,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Aurangabad: Water management experts on Thursday said that the government, over a period of last nine years, owes irrigation backlog to the tune of Rs 4,500 crore towards Marathwada.

Addressing a summit on water issues, Shankar Nagare, expert member (irrigation) of Marathwada Development Board, said the state government kept the region starved for funds, but released money for Amravati division.

“Amravati division kept receiving funds towards irrigation backlog on a regular basis since 2010. However, Marathwada did not get the same relief. If we assume release of minimum Rs 500 crore ever year, Marathwada has huge irrigation backlog of Rs 4,500 crore,” he said.

Raising the issue of alleged additional irrigation projects constructed in the upstream areas of Jayakwadi major irrigation project in Nashik and Ahmednagar districts, Nagare said such dams have a combined intake capacity of 45 TMC.

“The state government must compensate Marathwada for its share of water snatched by upstream areas. To achieve this, the government must divert excess water from Konkan to Marathwada via Vaitarna dam,” he said.

Nagare, a former executive director of Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC), also highlighted the key provisions of Nagpur Pact, 1953.

“As per the pact, Marathwada needs 150 TMC water in order to take the region at par with the state in terms of irrigation and other needs. Considering the 18 TMC water required for efficient functioning of the proposed Water Grid project for Marathwada, the region needs total 168 TMC water to become water-sufficient. The government must ensure this by diverting water from basins of other rivers,” he said.

Senior lawyer and president of advocacy group Marathwada Janta Vikas Parishad Pradeep Deshmukh raised the issue of alleged miscalculations while deciding equitable distribution of water for Marathwada.

“The water needs of Ahmednagar and Nashik districts are inflated, while that of Aurangabad , Jalna, Beed, Parbhani and Nanded are deflated while deciding equitable distribution. The stock of water available in minor irrigation projects from Ahmednagar and Nashik districts remain unaccounted ever year. These two districts together consume 42 TMC water and it is never taken into account,” he said.

Addressing the summit, water management expert Pradeep Purandare shed light on the effect of climate change and its possible impacts.

“The average annual temperature of Marathwada is 26.46 degrees celsius. As per credible studies, it is likely to increase by 1.44 degrees celsius to 1.56 degrees celsius by 2030 and further in the range of 2.15 degrees celsius to 2.3 degrees celsius by 2050. This increase could lead to surge in evaporation and evapotranspiration, which could affect net irrigation requirement and possible decline the crop yield,” he said.

PANAJI: The government has not granted any permissions for the Carnival parade to be held on the old route in Margao on February 23.

The high court of Bombay at Goa is hearing a petition filed by Custodio Dias challenging the holding of the parade through the town.

Additional government advocate Pravin Faldessai told the court on Thursday that no permissions have been issued yet to hold the parade on the old route—the national highway which runs from Holy Spirit Church via Hospicio Hospital to the Margao municipal building.

He stated that no permissions have been issued yet, although the government has received a proposal from the carnival organisation committee to hold the parade on this route.

Faldessai said he will place the material on the basis of which the proposal will be considered, before the court on Friday.

The high court issued a notice that is returnable on Friday to the Margao Carnival Committee.

Gujarat high court

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday ordered the city police commissioner to file an affidavit in reply to a petition challenging the continued imposition of Section 144 of the CrPC and Section 37 of the Bombay Police Act restraining a gathering of more than four persons in public places in Ahmedabad.

Earlier this month, an assistant commissioner of police had filed an affidavit in which he had tried to justify the continuous application of restraining provisions in the city. Justice S H Vora, however, said that a reply filed by any other officer, but the commissioner of police would not work. Since the notifications for imposition of restraining sections are issued in the name of the police commissioner, he should file an affidavit and reply to the court’s queries. The HC has sought the commissioner’s reply by March 6, sources said.

On February 5, an assistant commissioner of police told the HC that there were 496 incidents of rioting reported in Ahmedabad in last three years. His affidavit said that if the restrictions are removed, it “would lead to chaos in law and order situation in Ahmedabad”. The affidavit had also claimed that imposition of Section 144 of CrPC has “benign” effects too and enumerated five such beneficial effects.

The HC has also asked the cops to respond to its query that why the continued restraint orders on part of the police should not be perceived as if the city is under constant threat.

Five petitioners including a faculty member of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A) has challenged the police action after people were not allowed to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the city two months ago.

Bareilly: A display of bad temper and misbehaviour with his sister cost an Army man dear at his wedding as his bride-to-be refused to go through with it. When she saw the groom hit his sister with a chair in front of all the guests as she had refused to stop dancing, the bride considered it to be a glimpse of her fiancé’s real character. She said, “Today, he beat up his sister, in future he may mistreat me as well. I choose not to spend my life with a short-tempered man who has no respect for women.”

It all started in a banquet hall in Meerganj here on Wednesday. The wedding ceremonies of a Devhari village resident of Rampur district and woman of Lakha village in Shishgarh area in Bareilly were underway. The “ghud-chadhi” ceremony had been completed and the groom was sitting on the stage decorated for the couple-to-be.

According to witnesses, guests from groom’s side were dancing on the DJ floor. His younger sister joined them, dancing with gusto. For some reason, seeing the young girl dancing annoyed the groom. He asked her to leave the dance floor. But the girl did not pay any heed to her brother and continued to dance.

This enraged the groom who lost his cool. He went up to the dance floor, picked up a chair and flung it at his sister, hitting her. His behavior stunned the guests to silence.

Meanwhile, the bride had arrived on the stage with a “var-mala (wedding garland) in her hands. After witnessing the entire episode, she about- turned and walked off the stage. It is learnt that the groom was also drunk.

Back in her room, woman asked her parents to cancel the marriage.

Upon learning the bride’s decision, the groom’s family was furious and confronted her family members who had already alerted police.

Vijay Kumar, SHO, said police reached the wedding venue and tried to broker a compromise between both families, but in vain. The “baraat” went back without solemnising the marriage, the SHO added.

The drones will provide BSES field teams a bird’s eye view of the potential problem areas.

NEW DELHI: BSES discoms in the city have drawn an elaborate programme for using drones for monitoring the electricity network, including high-voltage (HV) lines and grid substations.

Using high-resolution imagery and infrared thermo scanning, it will involve inspection of the overhead lines and equipment, grid substations, connections, damaged switches, capacitors, detection of theft of equipment and intelligent line profiling, an official said.

This will provide BSES’ field teams with a bird’s eye view of the potential problem areas (physical condition of the assets and hotspots) and help in taking preventive actions by flagging irregularities timely.

“BSES discoms are committed to ensuring quality and reliable power supply. For this, the discoms have been exploring and deploying the latest and suitable technologies in their areas of operation. Preventive and predictive maintenance of the existing distribution network holds the key in ensuring seamless power supply,” he said.

According to him, the BSES drone programme, which has already taken off, will be used for accurately mapping assets on the GIS with high accuracy, power theft detection, inspection of rooftop solar installations, accurate assessment of rooftop solar potential along with obstructions and assessment of vegetation encroachment (around discom infrastructure).

The BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL), which operates in east and central Delhi, and BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL), which operates in south and west Delhi, have collaborated with Garuda UAV, a leading drone service provider, for visual and thermal mapping of the electrical infrastructure.

According to a BSES spokesperson, timely detection of potential trouble spots and issues plays a crucial role in ensuring reliable power supply. “Though BSES has a very robust system of undertaking preventing and predictive maintenance of its distribution network, the use of drone technology will be a force multiplier in its arsenal. It will help the discom in faster patrolling, accurate capturing of data using high-definition images and videos, hotspot identification and better preventive maintenance to lesser outages,” the spokesperson said.

337,['21/02/2020'],"Make judicious use of water, says minister","This story is from February 21, 2020

Aurangabad: Cabinet minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday said that water conservation should become the DNA of people in Marathwada region.

“Marathwada is a drought-prone region and has been facing more vagaries of monsoon since years. All stakeholders, including residents, farmers and industries must ensure judicious use of water,” he said.

Addressing a water summit organized by Shiv Sena functionary and former city MP Chandrakant Khaire in the city on Thursday, Tope stressed on the need of improving water distribution network of major dams from Marathwada.

“The canal systems of key dams such as Jayakwadi and Lower Dudhna are in poor shape, causing distribution losses. The poor distribution network restricts the dam water from reaching the tail-end. Even if official records show a certain amount of water release, the discharge does not reach the target areas,” he said.

Tope also stressed upon the need for diversion of water from different river basins towards Marathwada.

“Diversion of water from Krishna Basin can address water woes of some parts of the region, includingsome areas in Beed, Osmanabad and Latur districts. The excess rainwater flowing into the sea in the Konkan area must also be diverted for the benefit of Marathwada. Routing excess water from Painganga River towards Marathwada can offer relief to parts of Nanded district and nearby areas,” the minister said.

Earlier in his introductory speech, Khaire said that the water summit was organized as per the suggestion of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.

“Different resource persons have been invited for the summit. We will be preparing a list of key demands based on the discussions and deliberations discussed during the event. The demands will be presented before the chief minister, who is expected to give justice to it during the upcoming session of the state legislature,” he said.

Disposal of municipal solid waste generated by Rajkot city was stopped abruptly

Rajkot: Over six years after disposal of the ‘legacy’ waste of 4 lakh tonne solid waste at landfill site Nakravadi was halted, the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) resumed work on Thursday.

The disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated by Rajkot city was stopped abruptly in December 2013 after the agency assigned the job backed out. The RMC was only able to appoint the second agency after three years of efforts but that agency also failed to resume work.

Finally on Thursday, the third agency appointed by the civic body began clearing the MSW from the landfill site spread across 6 acres. Sources said that garbage heap, over the years, had grown to size of a six floor building. Rajkot city generated about 600 tonnes of solid waste everyday.

RMC environment engineer Nilesh Parmar said, “At Nakravadi a machine that segregate plastic, organic waste and other type of waste has been installed. From plastic waste Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) will be generated which has a calorific value of 3,000.”

He said that the fuel will be used to run the waste-to-energy power plant that will produce 14MW electricity. The power will be supplied to the state-run power distributor Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (PGVCL).

The waste-to-energy plant at Nakaravadi was inaugurated last month. The waste collection at Nakaravadi over the years had created health issues for surrounding villages. A new landfill site has been made about 100 meters from the old site in 15 acre land.

PANAJI: Peeved over the delay in announcing the reservation of seats for the Zilla Panchayat elections, Congress MLAs met on Thursday and unanimously decided that it was in the party’s interests not to fight the elections on party lines.

The MLAs, who have yet to convey their decision to state party president Girish Chodankar, said that they would back the candidates informally.

“There is confusion around the reservation of seats. They (state Election Commission) has made a mess of it. Because they are not creating a level-playing field, we felt that we should not contest the ZP elections on party lines,” opposition leader and Margao MLA Digambar Kamat said.

“We will convey the same to the party president. Ultimately the party president has to decide and convey the message to party workers,” Kamat said.

Chodankar said that he would call an executive committee meeting to discuss the decision taken by the CLP regarding the ZP polls.

“I will abide by whatever decision the executive committee takes,” Chodankar said.

However, insiders said that the Congress camp remains divided over the issue of fighting the ZP elections under the Congress banner. Many party workers rue that after the elections are held, the winning candidates sometimes change loyalties.

He added that the central government had also received inputs from some state governments and other agencies on PFI's alleged involvement in anti-CAA protests . PFI, on its part, has denied its link with any anti-CAA protest in the country.

The ED report is purportedly based on disclosures made by some PFI functionaries during questioning in connection with a money laundering probe against the outfit and an NGO linked to it.

Half-a-dozen office-bearers of the Kerala-based organisation were questioned by the ED early this month about the finances, expenditure, sources of funding and beneficiaries of the funds generated or distributed by it. TNN

The central probe agency, sources said, also recorded their statements under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

The ED is probing PFI and NGO Rehab India Foundation (RIF) under criminal provisions of the PMLA as part of an enforcement case information report (ECIR) or FIR filed in 2018. It is also probing charges that the organisations received and distributed funds from their bank accounts that were allegedly used to fuel some protests against the CAA in various parts of the country.

A screebgrab of Thakor’s post

AHMEDABAD: Crime branch officials on Thursday said they had arrested a man for allegedly posting a video showing a few hawkers’ carts being demolished by a JCB machine and alleged that poor people’s lives had become miserable ahead of US president Donald Trump ’s visit to Ahmedabad.

City crime branch in a statement said that the Vinod Thakor, 31, a resident of Shankheswar in Patan district and the president of the Congress social media cell in Patan had tried to instigate people ahead of Trump’s visit on February 24. The statement says officials of crime branch and cyber cell were keeping tabs on social media posts ahead of Trump’s visit.

A PSI of the wireless cell, H N Prajapati, on February 9 saw the post by Thakor. Thakor had written: “As the US president is coming to Ahmedabad, the BJP government is ruining the lives of poor people.” Thakor had shared a video showing purported workers breaking carts with vegetables and fruits on them with a JCB.

The crime branch statement claims Thakor had instigated people by attributing the video to Gujarat even though it was from Odisha. Prahapati then filed a complaint with city crime branch under IPC Sections 153 (provocative statements with intent to cause riots) and 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace).

The statement says Thakor was arrested from his house at Khodiyarnagar Society in Shankheswar town of Patan district late on Wednesday night. Crime branch officials did not clarify how Thakor was booked for attempting to cause riots over the wrongly attributed video. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation commissioner Vijay Nehra had on February 17 tweeted a clarification about the video, stating that it was not from the city and but from Odisha, while citing a report by a fact-check portal.

Bareilly: To ensure that children are ferried safely to school and back, Bareilly Regional Transport Officer (RTO) is set to step up its enforcement drive against erring school vehicles plying on city roads.

According to the information from Bareilly RTO, around 450 school vehicles are being operated on city roads and of these, most of the vehicles are run on contract basis. Earlier this month, around 300 school vehicles were checked by the transport authorities and around 65 drivers were issued challans for flouting various traffic rules.

Giving details about the latest move, transport authorities said all school vehicles will be checked to see if the safety norms set by the government and Supreme Court are in place. Under these norms it is mandatory for the vehicles to have first-aid kits, fire extinguishing device, an alarm system and speed governors. It is also mandatory that an attendant is present in school buses. Besides, the vehicles will also be inspected to ensure that general traffic rules are being followed. These relate to overloading, speeding, use of seat belt by driver and vehicle fitness among other norms.

Officials said school vehicles not having CCTV cameras are being exempted for the present.

Speaking with TOI, senior assistant regional transport officer (ARTO), Bareilly, RP Singh said, “The department is gearing up to intensify the enforcement activity against erring school vehicles across the city and a plan is being prepared for the drive. We have been planning frequent drives to check school vehicles as it is a matter of concern among parents as violation of Motor Vehicle norms is very common among school vehicles. The drive will be taken up shortly to check if they have necessary equipment like a first-aid kit, fire extinguisher and alarm system among others. Besides, we will be checking whether an attendant has been appointed in the vehicles, especially in buses, whether the drivers are using seatbelts, etc.”

Officials said the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act calls for installation of CCTV cameras and global positioning system in vehicles besides a display of driver’s details. These are being exempted for now. “The vehicle operators who do not have these devices will be served notices and time will be granted to them to install them,” added the ARTO.

He will be charged only for the level of charging needed in the battery, like a pay-as-you-use service,” he added.

He said Piaggio has tied up with Sun Mobility for supply of batteries for the vehicles. “The battery is lithium-ion and can be charged in one hour. We launched in Vijayawada because the autorickshaw provides last-mile connectivity. It has a top speed of 45 km,” he said.

According to KVS Prakash Rao, owner of Ramcor, the street price of the Ape E-City is Rs 2.06 lakh. “The vehicle does not release any pollution because it is battery-driven. It has a digital instrument cluster with information like state of charge, drive modes and service alerts,” Prakash Rao said.

352,['21/02/2020'],First national waterway floating jetty ready for launch today,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Chief minister Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: The first of the four floating jetties planned in the state under the national waterways (NW) project is ready. Union minister of state for shipping Mansukh Mandaviya and chief minister Pramod Sawant will commission it on Friday.

The floating jetty, which is an extension of the existing Captain of Ports (CoP) floating jetty, will serve as a mooring point for boats operated by the offshore casinos, said CoP officials.

According to officials, the concrete floating jetty boasts of fenders, water facilities, fire extinguishing systems, electrical cabling, lights, drainage outlets and pumps in order to facilitate smooth operations of small vessels. A separate location will be setup for discharge and disposal of sewage. It has been setup by Marinetek India as part of the Inland Waterways Authority of India ’s (IWAI) national waterways project.

Around mid-2018, in the face of stiff opposition from locals to the Centre’s river nationalisation plan, the state government, Mormugao Port Trust and IWAI quietly inked a tripartite memorandum of understanding whereby it was agreed that MPT would implement the national waterways project on behalf of IWAI. In October 2018, MPT floated the tender for the design and commissioning of three concrete floating jetties on Mandovi (NW 68) and one on Chapora (NW 25).

At that time, the cost of all four floating jetties was pegged at Rs 13 crore.

According to officials, IWAI has provided the funds for the floating jetties. “The pre-fab work on the pontoons for the second floating jetty at Old Goa has also started and is nearing completion,” said Marinetek India director Gautama Dutta.

The other two floating jetties planned are at the Panaji-Betim ferry point and in the Chapora river, on the west side of Siolim-Chopdem bridge.

Six rivers — Mandovi (44km), Zuari (50km), Cumbharjua (17km), Chapora (33km), Mapusa (27km) and Sal (14km) — in the state have been identified as rivers of national importance under the nationalisation of waterways project.

Pilibhit: Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Manish Kumar of the Allahabad High Court’s Lucknow Bench have imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on principal secretary of forest, UP government, Sudhir Garg for not appearing before the court.

Earlier on January 7, the court had directed the senior official to be present in person before it in connection with a case relating to framing of norms for recruitment of personnel for Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF) in UP and given him six weeks’ time for the same. However, Garg did not appear before the Bench on Monday. Then, the judges imposed a fine on him and directed him to deposit the penalty amount with state legal services authority within 15 days.

Giving this information to TOI along with a copy of the order concerned, Lucknow-based petitioner Satish Kumar Mishra said the penalty was imposed by the court after the Bench observed the principal secretary’s utter disregard of the court’s previous order.

“It was only after the court intended to give notice for contempt to the principal secretary that the latter sought half an hour’s time through his lawyer,” Mishra said.

Regarding the court’s direction on the completion of process for framing STPF norms, Mishra said the principal secretary has sought three months more time with the commitment that no extension would be prayed for in future for compliance with court’s orders. The court allowed it with instructions that the copy of the order be sent to all the government departments like home, finance and personnel, which have a role in the process.

problem solving

PANAJI: Getting a move on with the auction a fraction of the land parcels of the Special Economic Zones (SEZ), which was taken back from the original promoters, the state government has constituted a monitoring committee and a selection committee to oversee the auction.

The five-member selection committee, to be headed by industries secretary Nila Mohanan, will appoint a consultant to help Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) auction around 5 lakh sqm of prime industrial land.

Overseeing the auction will be a seven-member monitoring committee headed by industries minister Vishwajit Rane.

“The government is pleased to constitute a selection committee to initiate, finalise the process of getting on-board a property consultant on SEZ land matter, with an international profile and adequate experience, subject to terms of reference as recommended by the committee and approved by government,” industries under-secretary A S Mahatme said.

Other members of the selection committee, along with Mahatme, are additional secretary for finance Sunil Masurkar; director of trade industries and commerce Deepak Bandekar and managing director of GIDC Derrick Neto.

In the last week of December, the industries department had issued an order to GIDC asking it to go ahead with the auction of a fraction of the 38 lakh sqm of SEZ land and submit an action taken report. The order had sparked concerns among industry players who felt the government would auction land without creating necessary infrastructure for new industries or commercial units. Rane appears to have paid heed to these concerns raised by the private sector as several industry players, including Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) president, Manoj Caculo and Goa State Industries Association (GSIA) president, Damodar Kochkar feature on the monitoring committee.

355,['21/02/2020'],"Admin demolishes boundary wall of Azam’s university, gives farmers access to their land","This story is from February 21, 2020

Rampur: Rampur district administration on Thursday demolished a portion of the boundary wall of Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan’s Jauhar University, which was allegedly raised illegally on government land, to provide a passage to the farmers to their land on the university campus.

According to the district administration, the demolition was carried out amid tight security provided by local police after the university authorities failed to demolish illegal structures raised on around 17 bighas of government land despite a notice was served to them on February 15.

Azam Khan, his wife Tanzeen Fatimah and their son Abdullah Azam were not present in Rampur when the demolition was carried out. The MP and his wife and son — both MLAs — have been declared “absconders” by a local court, which also issued non-bailable warrants against them.

Aunjaneya Kumar Singh, who recently got an extension for one year as Rampur district magistrate, told TOI, “We are only complying with the order of the UP revenue board, which directed the administration to remove all encroachments from the village Chak road, a portion of which falls on the university campus. The boundary wall was raised on the land illegally occupied by the university. It was preventing farmers from approaching their land that falls on the university campus. And thus, a portion of the boundary wall was demolished to give the farmers access to their land.”

“We have given the university authorities three days to demolish all illegal structures. A notice was served, too, on February 15, but they failed to act. It’s better if they act themselves and remove encroachments as we don’t want the police force to enter the campus and affect the studies,” said the DM.

On Thursday afternoon, a heavy police force was deployed outside the university campus and the demolition was carried out in the presence of sub-divisional magistrate Prem Prakash Tiwari and other administrative officials. After the demolition, the village Chak road was opened for the farmers, said the DM.

“Since the university authorities failed to comply with the notice, they would have to bear the expenses incurred on the demolition,” added the DM.

According to the district administration, a portion of the medical college, science faculty and the vice-chancellor’s lodge — all erected illegally on 17 bighas of government land — will be demolished.

In 2007, then chief minister Mayawati had directed then Rampur DM Ram Sanjevan to demolish the boundary wall of Jauhar University to clear the road, which connects to Aliyaganj village near the university.

In August 2019, the boundary wall of Humsafar resort belonging to Abdullah Azam was demolished by the district administration, claiming that it was illegally built on government land.

Vijayawada: Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh along with a police delegation held a meeting with state DGP Gautam Sawang and home minister M Sucharita on Thursday to study the implementation of the Disha Act in Andhra Pradesh.

The delegation also met chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy and hailed the Andhra Pradesh government’s initiative to enact the Disha Act which aims to fast-track crimes against women and children with the provision of death penalty.

Deshmukh said the Maharashtra government too plans to bring in a similar legislation. “We have gathered full information about the Disha Act, police stations and other initiatives by the Andhra Pradesh government. We too plan to bring out something similar soon,” he said.

Home minister Sucharita said the Act was the first-of-its-kind in the country and the state government has so far earmarked Rs 87 crore for effective implementation of the law. “Under the Act, 13 special courts are being set up, besides a control room and one-stop centres to aid women and children in distress,” Sucharita said.

Elaborating on the progress made so far, chief secretary Nilam Sawhney said IAS officer Kritika Shukla and IPS officer Deepika Patil have been appointed exclusively to oversee the implementation of the Disha Act. Both Kritika and Deepika also gave an elaborate presentation to the Maharashtra delegation.

The AP legislature, during its winter session in December last year, passed the bill to amend the Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure to enable expeditious investigation and trial of offences against women and children, especially sexual offences, and award of death penalty.

Nashik: Central Railway is mulling the possibility of running Mainline Electrical Multiple Unit (MEMU) trains from Kalyan to Nashik, across the Kasara ghat. The rail division has written to the Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) in Lucknow requesting it to explore the potential of MEMU trains on the route.

The move comes after a recent meeting between Nashik MP Hemant Godse and general manager of Central Railway. Godse is believed to have discussed a quick shuttle-like train service between Nashik and Kalyan.

It has been nearly two years since reports first emerged of the launch of Electrical Multiple Unit (EMU) trains — also known as ‘locals’ — between Nashik and Kalyan.

In the ghat sections, trains need to have bankers (additional engines) at the rear while ascending or descending steep gradients. An RDSO clearance is required for that. But railway engineers flagged the project saying tunnels along the Kasara ghat section were not wide enough for the wide-bodied EMU. Engineers warned that passengers’ lives could be at risk. The Railways then dropped the idea of Kalyan-Igatpuri EMU operations. According to officials, the RDSO could conduct MEMU trials as its cars are of regular width.

RAJKOT: The next time you feel an urgency and spot a pay and use toilet nearby, ensure your pocket is full too. For, the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) on Thursday has decided to increase user charges for municipal lavatories from Rs 2 to 5. The standing committee has also given its approval for increased user charges.

Use of RMC toilets are free for women and children, while for the males, only the use of urinal is free.

RMC operates 137 toilets in the city, of which 77 are pay and use and 60 are free. Three toilets are out of order. The civic body plans to construct 55 more toilets in the near future.

When contacted, RMC environment engineer Nilesh Parmar said, “We have outsourced the toilets’ operation and maintenance to agencies who do not have to pay us anything, but maintain the toilet, pay salary of a person and electricity bill on their own. Keeping price rise in view they requested us to hike fees as it has become difficult for them to recover operational costs.”

CHENNAI: A procedure to transplant healthy cartilage from the knee along with bio-active material through a keyhole surgery by doctors at a city hospital has helped a 69-year-old school teacher walk without pain.

On Thursday, Sarah Hassler, a US national , told reporters that the pain in her knees restricted her from performing day-to-day activities at school. Doctors at the Apollo Hospitals on Old Mahabalipuram Road told her that the increasing knee pain was due to osteoarthritis. Conventionally, most patients are advised knee replacement surgeries. Though it would ensure a pain-free life, it may restrict patients from activities such as jogging, squatting and playing.

Doctors decided to use the Hassler “one-step minced cartilage procedure” which would save her natural joint. “Usually, surgery for cartilage repair is a two-step process involving autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI),” said Dr Madhan Thiruvengada, the hospital’s robotic joint replacement surgeon. For such surgeries, patients’ cartilage cells are harvested and grown in the lab for upto 6 weeks. The patient then undergoes the second procedure for implanting the grown cartilage tissue. “We do this in one step. A portion of a healthy cartilage from the patient’s knee is harvested and used. It reduces recovery time. There is no use of chemical agents during the procedure,” he said. Hassler was discharged in a day and has been on an international vacation since the surgery, he said.

CHANDIGARH: To the long list of reasons why adjournments are sought has been added a particularly unusual one: ""The mood of the court is bad this morning.""

This uncommon adjournment happened on February 4 in the Punjab and Haryana high court, where a lawyer arguing a civil revision petition apparently felt he didn't stand much of a chance after seeing Justice Rajiv Narain Raina dismiss the first four cases of the day, ""one after the other"".

Justice Raina accepted counsel KS Sidhu's plea for an adjournment, albeit after clarifying that the four cases he had dismissed back-to-back deserved to be treated so. ""The counsel, assuming the mood of the court is bad this morning [due to] dismissing of first four urgent cases one after the other... prays that time may be granted to him to argue the case some other day. I grant permission for an adjournment, but not without saying that those cases were not worth admission,"" he said.

In 2018, Raina had granted an adjournment in a civil suit after he was informed that the counsel representing one of the parties was newly married and would prefer to argue the case some other day.

The same year, Raina asked the Haryana government not to create hurdles in inter-faith marriages. He observed that seeking certain information during registration of marriages under the Special Marriage Act was tantamount to violation of privacy.

Pune: A construction contractor and a foreman were arrested on Wednesday on the charge of setting a worker on fire because he was pursuing them for his salary, due for the past three months.

The worker, Subhash Sahu (33), suffered 40% burns. His right hand and leg burnt in the incident. He is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Kalewadi Phata.

The incident occurred on February 3 but Sahu, currently residing at Tathawade, lodged an FIR only on Wednesday because the duo had had threatened him with dire consequences. Sahu has his roots in Bihar.

A Hinjewadi police team led by assistant inspector Uddhav Khade took the contractor, Mohammed Zumratiya (40) of Tapkirnagar, and foreman Santoshkumar Harakram (36) of Tathawade into custody late on Wednesday night. They have been charged under sections 307 (murder attempt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

Khade said while getting admitted to the hospital, Sahu had told the doctors around 4pm on February 3 that he saw a snake along the service road near his construction site. “In an attempt to save himself, he accidentally touched a live wire and suffered burns. No one suspected him and began the treatment,” Khade said, quoting the hospital authorities.

He said the hospital authorities approached the police on Wednesday after Sahu told them that he was set on fire. “We then recorded his statement,” Khade said.

Sahu in his statement said, “When I again demanded money, contractor Zumratiya and foreman Harakram pour petrol on me outside the site and set me on fire.”

He said Sahu also alleged in his complaint that while admitting him in the hospital, the duo had pressurised him to give false statement to the doctors and threatened to kill him. “After his relatives came from Bihar, he gathered courage and recorded his statement,” Khade said.

“We shall take medico-legal opinion to find out whether Sahu’s burn injuries were due to electric shock or petrol,” Khade added.

Pune: Analysing CCTV cameras and studying modus operandi of burglars helped the Wanowrie police arrest two criminals on Wednesday and detect 21 cases, including burglaries at three jewellery stores and vehicle thefts from 2018.

Police seized 109.27kg silver, 200g gold, four cars and two motorcycles valued at over Rs1 crore from the arrested duo — Tilaksingh Tak (28) and Jaisingh alias Pillusingh Juni (26) from Ramtekdi and Vaiduwadi. Bandu Waghmare (35) from Hadapsar was also taken into custody for receiving the stolen loot from the criminals.

The police launched investigations into a burglary case lodged with the Wanowrie police on February 3. They analysed footage from 34 CCTV cameras capturing images of Tak and Juni, involved in stealing ornaments from jewellery stores at Wakad, Chinchwad and Sinhagad Road, among other places.

Acting on a tip-off, a police team comprising Nasir Deshmukh and Navnath Khatal, under senior inspector Krantisinh Patil, arrested Tak and Juni.

Senior inspector Patil said in a statement, “Tak and Juni admitted to their involvement in a string of burglaries registered with the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad police commissionerate, and the Pune rural police from 2018. They have also spit out the names of their two accomplices on the run during questioning.”

The police said the suspects would steal vehicles and use them for committing burglaries at jewellery stores and other places at night. They would abandon the vehicles after exhausting the fuel or if they developed technical snags.

“We have also seized a screw driver, crowbar, three scissors and five duplicate keys from the criminals. A team under inspector Salim Chaus has launched a hunt for arresting the criminals on the run,” Patil said in the statement.

INDORE: After a dramatic series of events at a temporary picket, police on Thursday arrested a man believed to be a member of vehicle lifters gang and seized hi-tech equipment used for unlocking digital locks from his car in Kishanganj late on Wednesday. Two SUVs accompanying the car got away during encounter.

Though empty cartridges were found from the spot, officials claimed that there was no firing from either side during the encounter.

SP West Mahesh Chandra Jain said that they had stationed four teams comprising 12 officials from four police stations including Juni Indore , Bhanwarkuan, Rajendra Nagar and Annapurna near a lane in Kishanganj, where the incident took place.

“Head constable Mahesh Chouhan, who was in one of the police vehicles, saw three vehicles approaching. He got down and tried to stop them but driver of vehicle in the front hit him and tried to flee the spot,” said Jain.

He added that as other officials saw that Chouhan was injured, they rushed to his rescue while one of the constables tried to stop the accused by parking his vehicle in front of the hatchback.

The two SUVs, however, managed to maneuver and flee the spot as the first vehicle was caught by officials present on the spot.

The other two teams also reached there and tried to follow the accused but were not able to do so.

“We have seized some hi-tech equipment from arrested accused, who identified himself as RN Khan, and an identification card has also been seized from him but it is being checked if it is true,” said SP Jain.

Officials believe that gang members are from Uttar Pradesh and had a nexus in MP too.

“The equipment including key maker, hammers, screws and sharp weapons suggest that they are members of some hardcore criminal gang,” said ASP Rajesh Vyas adding that an internet dongle has been recovered and he told them that they only made internet calls so it was almost impossible to track them.

Officials said that the accused has been arrested and he is being interrogated on crimes committed by them in state and elsewhere.

PANAJI: To help further reduce the burden of heavy school bags, the directorate of education (DoE) has asked schools to allow two students to share one textbook.

DoOE director Vandana Rao has said that schools can also maintain a spare set of textbooks for students to use.

“Minimise the need to bring textbooks for certain subjects by covering the course material in the class,” the circular issued said. Schools have been asked to follow the instructions to avoid ‘adverse effects of heavy school bags’ on students.

“Use audio-visual methods in the class rather than having the students refer to a textbook,” Rao has said.

In November 2019, backed by rising complaints of back and neck pain among school children in the state, the state government’s victim assistance unit (VAU) had demanded clear-cut guidelines for reducing the weight of school bags.

As per DoE’s earlier guidelines, the weight of a school bag should not exceed 10% of the body weight of the child.

Teachers have been told to “pre-inform students about books, notebooks to be carried in a particular day.”

Visakhapatnam: Panic broke out across the city after a number of photographs showing a lion attacking a person at Visakha Container Terminal (VCT) went viral on social media platforms. Responding to it, officials of the VCT put out a statement on Thursday stating that the photographs have no connection with the Visakhapatnam port.

A VCT spokesperson said, “There was a viral message on WhatsApp stating that there were lions in the container terminal area of Visakhapatnam port and a person had been attacked. The images have no relation with Visakhapatnam.”

In their clarification, VCT officials said that the images doing the rounds on social media are from Port Pipavav located in Amreli district located around 78km from Diu in Gujarat. Lions are known to frequent the area often, they said.

“A few photographs went viral showing bulk containers in the backdrop. Imposters convinced people that the photographs are from the container terminal of Visakhapatnam port,” said an official.

Officials of the forest department said that the question of wild lions roaming in and around Visakhapatnam does not arise. “There is no lion population in north Andhra,” said D Nalini Mohan, the principal chief conservator of forests.

“Having a medical college in a city like Nashik is very important. To strengthen quality and quantity of the public health service in the city, we plan to start the first course in the 2020-21 itself. It will be held on the Maharashtra University Health Sciences (MUHS) campus to begin with,” Tope, who was on a day’s tour in Nashik, said.

Tope visited the referral hospital in the city and the district civil hospital. Appreciating the services rendered by the staff and the professionals in these hospitals, the minister said that the government wants to make available maximum numbers of medical professionals like these for its own sources so that the health of people is taken care of.

“Medical college is the most important asset for the state as well as the country as it brings quality treatment at affordable costs for needy patients. It also helps in producing good quality doctors. The state government will go to any lengths to ensure that we start a medical college in the city in 2020-21,” Tope said.

CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Thursday ordered an interim stay in the recruitment of more than 8,000 posts in Tamil Nadu fire and rescue services in response to a petition that sought a CBI probe into alleged malpractices in the recruitment by Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board (TNUSRB).

Expressing displeasure, Justice N Anand Venkatesh, before whom the petition came up, observed that people will lose confidence in the state if there is fraud in every public service examination.

As many as 15 people had moved the court seeking probe by the central agency even as ripples created by the TNPSC recruitment scam are yet to settle down in the state.

“About 1,019 candidates have been selected from Vellore district and another 763 were chosen from exam centres in Villupuram. All of these candidates were declared to have secured more than 72 marks in the exam. Most of those selected from Vellore are from Sigaram Tuition Centre,” according to the petition.

A notification was issued by TNUSRB in 2019 for filling 8,888 vacant posts of grade-II constables, firemen and jail wardens. Written exams were conducted on August 25 last year and physical examination and endurance tests were held in November 2019.

According to the petitioners, the board published a provisional selection list on February 4 in which their names did not feature, though they had cleared the written exam and physical test. The petitioners contended that most of the candidates selected had secured 69 marks and the highest seems to be 88 marks by a candidate for the post of fireman. Expressing shock that cut-off marks were not published for any category, the petitioners sought the court’s intervention in the matter.

Besides irregularities in the selection process, 20% reservation for people who studied in Tamil medium has not been provided in the recruitment, the petitioners said.

The petitioners had wanted the court to call for the records of the provisional list and quash the same besides ordering a CBI probe into the alleged irregularities.

As an interim relief, the 15 petitioners had requested the court to direct the board to produce their OMR answer sheets.

On Thursday, when the petition came up for hearing, Justice N Anand Venkatesh ordered that the entire selection shall be kept in abeyance for a period of one week considering the allegations made. Directing the recruiting body to respond on the matter, the court adjourned the petition to March 5.

In the affidavit submitted before the court, Game said the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had finalised free hawking zones and restricted zones based on the norms finalised by the civic administration’s general body. But the Don Bosco Road was not included in the resolution of general body or in any of its subsequent orders.

In the affidavit, Game said then divisional officer Nitin Ner had granted temporary permission to the hawkers to ply their business on the Don Bosco Road without the permission or the knowledge of the municipal commissioner.

“The divisional officer has already been suspended for certain other illegalities committed by him with regard to encroachments in other places. Moreover, a show-cause notice has been served to the divisional officer for granting permission to the hawkers on Don Bosco road. An enquiry is to be conducted against him,” stated the affidavit quoting Game.

During the last hearing on February 17, the court was peeved with the civic body for seeking more time to make the road free from hawkers. The court had then directed the municipal commissioner to be personally present during the hearing on Thursday.

Sachin Shinde, the lawyer representing the petitioners said, “The court has ordered the NMC to remove illegal hawkers and encroachments near the schools within a week. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game has also submitted an affidavit to the court promising to make the area near schools free of hawkers within a week.”

Game told TOI, “We have told the court that we will take another week to remove the encroachments and make the area free of hawkers.”

The court has also directed the city police to ensure that hawkers do not return and start doing business once the civic administrations evicts them.

NEW DELHI: Students of Jamia Millia Islamia ’s Joint Coordination Committee protested outside UP Bhavan on Thursday, opposing the alleged slapping of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and National Security Act (NSA) on the people involved in anti-CAA/NRC agitations. Several of the protesters were detained and taken to Mandir Marg police station.

Among those detained by the police were around 40 students and a few locals, who have been sitting on a protest outside the Jamia campus’ gate number 7 since December 15. A 15-year-old local, Faizan, was also detained.

JCC said that they also protested against the UP government and demanded the release of former Gorakhpur hospital doctor, Kafeel Khan.

“Innocent people are being thrown into jails. They are being slapped with draconian laws such as UAPA, NSA and others. We demand that all political prisoners be released without delay. When state turns rogue, who is going to protect the rights of the citizens?” asked the committee.

“Police were aware of the protest and as soon as the students and locals gathered near UP Bhavan, the cops detained them and started putting them in buses. They were taken to Mandir Marg police station,” said JCC member Raghib Naushad.

Another JCC member Safoora Zargar claimed that the detained protesters were not provided food for some time at the police station and they were also not given a bus to go back to Jamia.

When contacted, a senior officer of Delhi Police said: “A few people were detained during the protests at UP Bhavan, who were released after some time.”

PONDA: Following opposition to work on a pipeline at Dhatwada-Usgao in Ponda, superintending engineer of the water resources department (WRD) Pramod Badami carried out an inspection of the site on Wednesday and tried to placate villagers.

WRD claims that so far, just one person has agreed to let them run the underground pipeline through his land.

The department had intended to start work on this land first, until the rest are onboard. Villagers, however, threatened to agitate if the WRD begins the project. Vasudev Gaude, secretary of the Dhatwada-Usgao Citizen Forum, said they would protest at the site.

WRD is laying a 1,000mm pipeline to facilitate augmentation of the Khandepar river during summer using water from the Ganjem water scheme on the Mhadei. The Opa water works complex, catering to Ponda and Tiswadi, is dependent on the Khandepar.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: After isolated light rain and thundershowers on late Thursday night, Delhi is likely to see more rain on Friday but it will stay scattered, the weatherman predicted on Thursday.

“On Friday, a partly cloudy sky is expected with light rain or thundershowers. Strong surface winds (25-30km per hour) during the day are expected. The maximum and minimum temperatures will be around 24 and 13 degrees Celsius, respectively,” a meteorological official said.

On Thursday, the maximum and minimum temperatures were 27.5 and 13.6, both three notches above normal, the official added.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), between Thursday and Saturday, scattered-to-fairly widespread rain and thundershowers are expected over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. “It has already started raining in Haryana. The maximum temperature of 26-27 degrees Celsius may go down to 23-24,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre at Delhi.

Thursday was also a windy day. While the average speed was 25km per hour, there were also gusty spells of up to 40km per hour. The windspeed will decrease from Saturday, Srivastava added.

In terms of pollution, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) readings showed the air quality index at 230 in the poor category. On the CPCB index, an AQI of 0-50 is considered “good”, 51-100 “satisfactory”, 101-200 “moderate”, 201-300 “poor”, 301-400 “very poor” and 401-500 “severe”.

According to CPCB’s central control room data, while Delhi’s average PM2.5 was 98 micrograms per cubic metre at 7pm on Thursday, the average PM10 was 219.5. The safe standards for both pollutants are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively, and their “emergency” benchmark under the Graded Response Action Plan, which has been chalked out to tackle air pollution in the national capital region, is 300 and 500.

According to SAFAR, a central weather forecast agency, the scattered rainfall, under the influence of a western disturbance, will improve AQI to the moderate category by Friday. But a marginal deterioration to the poor category has been forecast for Saturday while by Sunday, AQI is likely to slide into the higher end of “poor” to “very poor”, said SAFAR.

390,['21/02/2020'],Salem Accident: Six Nepal pilgrims killed in van-bus collision in Salem,"This story is from February 21, 2020

The minibus was heading to Rajasthan via Salem

SALEM: Six pilgrims from Nepal, two of them women, were killed and 25 others injured after an omnibus rammed a minibus near Omalur here in the early hours of Thursday.

District superintendent of police (SP) Deepa Ganigar said they had alerted the kin of the deceased through Nepal embassy in Chennai and they were expected to reach the city on Friday morning to receive the bodies.

According to the officer, the accident took place when the minibus, with a total of 34 Nepalese on board, was heading to Rajasthan via Salem after visiting Kanyakumari. “They had come down to the country to visit Hindu temples.”

When the minibus reached Naripallam on Salem-Bengaluru National Highway around 1am on Thursday, the officer said, passengers asked the driver to stop the vehicle for them to refresh.

Beemla Chowdry, 40, one of the passengers said, “We were travelling continuously for more than 10 hours and we wanted to take rest for a while. So, we asked the driver to park the vehicle near a stone mandapam belonging to a Kalilamman temple on the highway.”

Driver Gowlram Chowdhari subsequently parked the minibus on roadside and a few of them approached the night security at the temple, seeking permission to stay there for a few hours.

The SP said, “After obtaining permission from the security guard, they asked the driver to come to the stone mandapam. Chowdhari moved the minibus without noticing the omnibus that was coming in from the opposite direction. While the omnibus driver tried his best to avoid collision with the minibus, he didn’t succeed and hit the bus carrying the pilgrims at the centre, killing four of them on the spot and injuring others.”

She said the omnibus was heading to Kerala from Bengaluru and the passengers in that vehicle escaped unhurt.

When alerted by other motorists on the stretch, the Omalur police took the injured to the Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital. The SP also reached the accident spot and oversaw the investigation.

“While Ber Bathur Rai, 46, Tikaram, 50, Gopal Taman, 53 and Bodhini, 50 died on the spot, Bulkari Cowdhri, 50, and Vishnu Thangal, 55, died in the hospital without responding to the treatment. The remaining passengers are out of danger,” the officer said.

Collector S A Raman, meanwhile, visited the injured at the government hospital and consoled them.

The Omalur police have registered a case under Sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 304 (a) (causing death by negligence) of Indian Penal Code and further inquiry is on. They are, however, yet to make any arrest.

391,['21/02/2020'],No end to manual scavenging in Trichy,"This story is from February 21, 2020

A sanitary worker entering a manhole of UGD chamber in Trichy

TRICHY: The tall claims and promises by authorities on eradicating manual scavenging in Trichy city are nothing but a lie as the practice of deploying humans inside manholes to clean clogs in the underground drainage (UGD) chambers is still plevalent. Trichy City Corporation has never given priority to finding a solution to end the inhuman and dangerous practice.

About 35% of Trichy city is covered under sewage network through 60,000 houses and commercial UGD connections. Residents who dump sanitary napkins, diapers and even vessels in the sewers cause blockages of the UGD lines. The corporation uses a sewer jetting machine mounted on a truck or a mini-load van to clear the block. The machines using water pressure will remove the blockages in sewers. But to fix the machine’s nozzle at the exact location of the clog, sanitary workers have to enter the UGD chamber.

""Getting into the UGD chamber and coming into contact with faecal waste amounts to manual scavenging. If entering the chamber is inevitable, all safety gear should be used to avoid contact with the waste,"" a city-based expert in sewage management said.

A total of 12-15 such manual scavengers hired through private contractors are employed in the four zones of the corporation for the purpose. But the corporation has never tried to find an alternative to this practice or to make the inevitable job safe. Kumbakonam municipality had purchased a semi-automatic robot to clean the UGD chambers, but no such machine was purchased for Trichy city.

Officials said that the automatic sewer cleaning machine like the one in Kumbakonam will only do vertical cleaning. For horizontal cleaning such as removal of blockages in sewers, most of the civic bodies still rely on the manual scavengers. ""We have planned to study the super sucker machine used in Chennai for safe cleaning of UGD blockages. A suitable machine will be purchased,"" a senior official with Trichy City Corporation said.

392,['21/02/2020'],Pothole repairs to start this month,"This story is from February 21, 2020

New Delhi: Come April and the capital may largely be free of pothole-ridden stretches with the public works department (PWD) going to start a resurfacing project, which was ordered by the previous Delhi government. The Rs 320-crore project will start by the end of this month.

A few of the worst-affected areas are Badarpur, Mathura Road, Ashram, Najafgarh and Raja Garden while the Rao Tula Ram Marg, IIT and Munirka flyovers have also developed huge potholes. Potholes are often responsible for accidents, many of which prove to be fatal.

A senior government official said PWD would resurface all roads coming under its jurisdiction by early April. The agency will first test the strength of a road before resurfacing it by removing potholes and other obstructions.

The government wants to minimise the number of accidents to the maximum extent possible, said another official. As the construction ban has been fully lifted, PWD will soon start its work and a sizeable portion is likely to be covered by mid-March, he added. The areas with heavy traffic flow will be taken up first.

The official said the government had received multiple complaints from commuters across the city regarding potholes on several patches, which led to the compilation of a list of such stretches before the assembly elections. The damaged footpaths will also be repaired.

Once the resurfacing is done, PWD may also look at the stretches with several traffic bottlenecks. For smooth movement, especially during peak hours, the agency will try to add a single lane on both sides of such stretches wherever possible.

A survey of the PWD roads was carried out last October to identify the stretches with potholes, irregular surfaces and damaged medians. As many as 50 MLAs, along with 50 assistant engineers, went around their constituencies and clicked photos of damaged roads, which were later uploaded on a mobile application created by Delhi government to track potholes.

On Thursday, NMC chief Radhakrishna Game had to be present for a Bombay HC hearing. This was his second summons to the HC in 22 days. In January, he was summoned in a case related to outsourcing of sanitation work.

Sources said there is a feeling that a section of NMC’s lawyers are unable to argue cases properly. “I am going to review the performances of all our empanelled lawyers. If required, we will revamp the panel,” Game told TOI.

The 26 lawyers are divided into three panels — one for Supreme Court cases, one for Bombay HC and a third one for district court cases.

“The HC panel has five senior and two juniors. NMC pays Rs 35,000 per case to senior lawyers and Rs 20,000 to junior lawyers. They are paid the case ends,” NMC sources said. The panel for Nashik district court has 12 senior (Rs 12,000) and 5 junior lawyers (Rs 5,000). There are two lawyers in the SC panel. NMC pays Rs 12,000 when there is an important hearing and Rs 50,000 on the final hearing. Till December 2018, there were 2,042 cases pending with three courts.

CHENNAI: P Maruthamuthu , former vice-chancellor of Madurai Kamaraj University , was elected senate nominee to the Madras University ’s vice-chancellor search panel on Thursday.

With his nomination, now the search panel has two former VCs. The governor-chancellor has to appoint his nominee to complete the search panel for selecting the new vice-chancellor.

Last week, the Madras University syndicate had nominated P Ramasamy, former vice-chancellor of Alagappa University, to the search panel.

During the special senate meeting convened to elect a nominee to the search panel, the two associations in Madras University — professors forum of Madras University and Madras University teachers association (MUTA) — nominated Maruthamuthu and M Anandakrishnan, former vice-chancellor of Anna University, to the search panel. Following the two proposals, the senate conducted voting to choose its nominee. “Out of the 87 votes polled on Thursday, Maruthamuthu got 65 votes and Anandkrishnan got 21. One vote was not valid,” a senate member said.The three-year tenure of vice-chancellor P Duraisamy is coming to an end in May.

In 2016, following the disappearance and non-cooperation of R Surendira Prasad, former member of the Madras University VC search panel , the state government had brought an amendment fixing minimum qualification for search panel members and time limit to shortlist VC candidates.

On Thursday, the mayor held a meeting with the civic officials and the members of NMC’s women and child welfare committee. The meeting came against the backdrop of the committee’s allegations that the administration had been diverting its funds for past three years.

Kulkarni said the budgetary provision for the committee last year was Rs 22 crore, but the administration used the funds on different works. “I have given directives to use the funds for works proposed by the committee,” said the Kulkarni.

The meeting was attended by Hemlata Kandekar, the chairperson of the committee, and other panel members. Officials from the civic body included additional commissioners B J Sonkamble and Sandip Nalawade, and city engineer Sanjay Ghuge.

396,['21/02/2020'],Govt looks to expand mohalla clinic reach,"This story is from February 21, 2020

New Delhi: Delhi government is all set to expand the network of mohalla clinics in a mission mode. The aim is to ensure that the primary healthcare facility reaches all the residents in their neighbourhood. The government is planning to open 351 clinics by April this year.

At a meeting held at Delhi Secretariat on Thursday, health minister Satyendar Jain reviewed the status of the existing clinics and directed the authorities present to expand the network of the healthcare facility in the national capital. Jain also ordered installation of CCTV cameras inside the diagnostic labs to keep an eye on malpractices. The authorities have been instructed to regularly monitor the availability of medicines.

It was noted in the review meeting that the number of patients visiting mohalla clinics was rapidly growing. It prompted the health minister to emphasise on the need to digitise prescriptions for diagnostic tests through test referral reports. “Digitisation of prescriptions and reports will smoothen the functioning of the centres. As the state-run healthcare facilities expand in number, the monitoring system too will need regular upgrading,” Jain stated in the meeting.

Mohalla clinics have been one of the most talked about projects of the AAP government. The model has already been emulated by a few states. Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Biocon CMD, had on Wednesday described the mohalla clinic facility as a step in the right direction towards achieving the sustainable development goal of universal health coverage.

After visiting the facility in Saket, she had tweeted: “Just visited a mohalla clinic in Saket, Delhi, which was most impressive. Neat and clean and very efficient. I spoke to the people who said it was a boon for the mohalla. Need to replicate this model across the country.” In a video message, she added that she was very impressed with the way it is conceived.

Over 450 mohalla clinics have been opened so far in Delhi. In its previous term, the government had planned to open 1,000 such clinics, but it could not materialise mainly due to the tussle with Centre and issues related to availability of land. Aam Aadmi Party has recently promised in its 10-point guarantee card that holistic healthcare facilities will be provided to every family through mohalla clinics and state-of-the-art hospitals.

Bengaluru: Home minister Basavaraj Bommai was left fumbling and embarrassed on Thursday when historian Ramachandra Guha denied that he (Bommai) had called to him (Guha) to offer an apology after he was manhandled by police during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December last year.

Lambasted by the opposition over the government’s handling of protests against CAA, Bommai had claimed on the floor of the house on Wednesday that he had personally apologized to Guha. But the writer, in a two-part tweet on Thursday, said, ""The Home Minister of Karnataka has claimed on the floor of the state Assembly that he apologised to me by phone for the manhandling by the Bengaluru police on 19th December 2019. This is false. I received no such call or apology.""

Guha went on to say: ""Even if such an apology had been offered, I would have rejected it. The imposition of Section 144 was illegal (as the Karnataka High Court has since held) and I was proud to be one of thousands of peaceful protesters who defied the State’s arbitrary action on that day.""

Caught on the wrong foot, Bommai mumbled through an explanation. He told TOI that he intended to say he had apologised ""to Guha and others in a public speech"" and not in person.

""I wanted to say that I had called MLAs UT Khader and Tanveer Sait to alert them about anti-national elements. And I wanted to add that I even apologised to Guha in public. It got it all mixed up,"" Bommai said.

On Wednesday, while apologising to former speaker KR Ramesh Kumar for the notice Mangaluru police had served on him when he tried to enter the city despite a ban, Bommai said he had personally apologised to Guha.

The claim came in reply to a discussion on a series of developments in the state after CAA was enacted. Two people were killed in Mangaluru when police opened fire on a group protesting against CAA, while police have used prohibitory orders to muzzle protests across the state.

Guha had participated in a protest in front of Town Hall in Bengaluru on December 19, which was in defiance of prohibitory orders imposed by the police.

CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Corporation has decided to fill its vacancies through the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission ( TNPSC ), against the current practice of choosing candidates through the district employment exchange.

A decision to this effect was made in the November 2019 council meeting, resolutions of which were uploaded on the corporation website on Thursday. The civic body has not had an elected council in place for four years. Corporation commissioner G Prakash is the special officer. Currently, the corporation has 805 vacancies for various positions.

According to official documents, the corporation has decided that vacancies in its medical department will be filled through the state medical services commission.

Until recently, vacancies for the posts of engineers were filled through the employment exchange. In the latest instance of the corporation conducting recruitment directly, the results were not released due to administrative reasons.

However, the corporation said that in other parts of the state, vacancies are filled through the TNSPC, which conducts the exams in a professional and systematic manner. Whenever vacancies arise, TNPSC fills it in a phased manner, the corporation said. The civic body does not have a similar infrastructure to conduct examinations, it said in the resolution. However, this decision of the civic body would have to be ratified by the state government.

Apart from this, the corporation continues to fill posts through appointments on compassionate ground, where relatives of employees who die during work are given jobs.

As per data, there are around 100 vacancies for the post of assistant, 98 for assistant engineer (civil), 83 for license inspector, 53 for typists, 35 for wireman and so on. There are 90 vacancies in the sanitary inspector cadre, but the government is framing rules for the same, the resolution added.

A senior official said that recruitment through TNPSC would bring down the average age of corporation employees. For instance, candidates recruited through the employment exchange are hired according to the date of enrolment. Assistant engineers aged more than 40 have also been recruited recently. “However, through TNPSC, fresh college candidates will be recruited,” the official said.

New Delhi: Senior BJP leader Vijay Goel on Thursday urged chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to immediately release funds due to the municipal corporations and implement Ayushman Bharat health scheme.

We request him to stop his step-motherly attitude towards the municipal corporations and release approximately Rs 10,000 crore due to them.”

“If he wants to cooperate with the Centre, he should immediately implement Ayushman Bharat scheme and PM Awas Yojna. Also, he should try to solve the problem of dirty water supply by taking help of the Centre and civic bodies ,” the Rajya Sabha member added.

401,['21/02/2020'],Veligonda project: CM sets August deadline for first phase completion,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Markapuram: Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy on Thursday set a new deadline for completion of the first phase of Veligonda project.

Directing officials to complete it by August 2020 and release water to the ayucut, he made it clear that there should not be any more delays in completing the works as it has already been delayed by a decade due to the negligence of the previous government. He also asked officials and contractors to ensure the speedy completion of the second phase of the prestigious project.

Jagan, who inspected the project in Prakasam district and held a review meeting with officials, public representatives and contractors, said the contractor should plan the works in such a way that they should complete the first phase for water release by August.

“Only 600 metres of first tunnel work was completed during the five-year rule of the TDP. I will not allow such tardy progress,” he said.

In response to the CM’s directive, executives of contracting firm said they were completing at least 200 metres of tunnel work per month and hope to reach the target by June-July itself. Expressing his satisfaction over completion of 1,400 metres of tunnel work in the last eight months, the CM asked them to further expedite the work. He also wanted to know why work on only 410 metres on the second tunnel was completed during the TDP regime.

He also asked district collector Pola Bhaskar as to why the head regulator work was not progressing as per schedule. The collector explained that land acquisition process picked up momentum only in the last few months and they would complete it by March 31 to enable the speedy construction of the head regulator. The government had replaced the contractor of the head regulator as the previous agency failed to put it on fast track. The new contractors promised the chief minister to complete the works as per the deadline fixed by the department. Work on the head regulator as well as the second tunnel work would be completed within four months, they said, adding that they have launched tunnel boring works from both sides to complete the project ahead of schedule.

Jagan also agreed to revise the relief and rehabilitation package for the project affected. He asked irrigation officials to explore the feasibility to look into the request of education minister Adimulapu Suresh to dig a new channel at T5 block to provide irrigation water to about 11,500 acres in Pullalacheruvu mandal. He responded positively to the minister’s request to spare Rs 70 crore to complete the channel as it would benefit local farmers.

The CM also directed officials to consider the request of Kandukur legislator Manugunta Mahidhar Reddy to give water to Rallapadu reservoir from Veligonda eastern canal. Ministers Anil Kumar Yadav, Balineni Srinivas Reddy, A Suresh, Pinipe Viswaroop, special chief secretary Adityanath Das, MLAs Nagarjuna Reddy, Sudhakar Babu, Venugopal, Anna Rambabu and MP Magunta Srinivasula Reddy were also present at the review meeting.

405,['21/02/2020'],Corporator raises a stink over garbage collection,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Nashik: Shiv Sena’s Panchavati corporator Poonam Mogre has warned the civic authorities that if they failed to resolve the garbage collection issue in the area, the Panchavati residents would start dumping garbage in front of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) headquarters.

Mogre said in absence of proper garbage collection, the entire area is stinking and is covered in filth.

“The NMC administration has assured that the problem will be resolved within the next fortnight as it is in the process of appointing new contractors to lift the garbage from Panchavati and Cidco,” she said. “We will wait for a fortnight and will launch severe agitation if the garbage collection system is not regularised ,” she said.

“I have been getting complaints from residents about the garbage not being lifted by NMC,” she said.

Another corporator from Panchavati division, Ashok Murtadak of MNS, said the NMC has to take immediate measures to clear all the garbage.

“Garbage vans have not been coming in my area for the many days. NMC administration needs to start garbage collection on its own,” said Swati Pagare, a resident of Panchavati division.

This situation was created after the NMC terminated the garbage collection contracts of a Pune-based contractor, who was entrusted with lifting garbage from the area.

“After the termination of the contract, we had given the work to contractors from other divisions. Earlier, they had inadequate numbers of vehicles operating in these two divisions. But the number of the vehicles has been increased. We are making efforts to regularise garbage vans in both the divisions,” said Sunil Bukane, director, solid waste department of NMC.

During the recent general body meeting, municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game and mayor Satish Kulkarni had said that measures are being taken to regularise the garbage collection system. They said that they will soon initiate a tender process to appoint a new contractor. Until then, the work is to be done by the two existing garbage collection contractors.

ERODE: A four-year-old male tiger was found dead at Neithalapuram in Thalavadi forest range in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) on Thursday. The forest department is yet to ascertain the cause of animal’s death .

S Sivakumar, ranger, Thalavadi forest range, said the carcass of the animal was first spotted by local villagers. “They immediately alerted us. Though initially we suspected it to be a case of poaching, we ruled out that possibility later as its nails and teeth were intact. It seems that the animal has been suffering from some ailment and has not been taking food for days,” he said.

Veterinarians attached to the forest department performed postmortem at the spot itself and later buried the carcass in the reserve forest. “We have collected vital organs of the tiger to ascertain the exact cause of its death. They would be sent for lab test,” the ranger said.

Amaravati: TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh has dared his political opponents to prove the charges of illegal assets owned by his family, adding that if the charges are proved his family would return all such assets to them as gift.

Lokesh, who declared the assets of his family members at the TDP office on Thursday, said they have been following the practice of declaring their assets to the public for the past nine years. “Instead of depending on the Enforcement Directorate, CBI and income tax authorities to declare his assets, chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy should himself come out in open to reveal his assets,” he demanded.

Stating that there was nothing to hide about his family’s earnings and assets, he said anyone, including YSRC functionaries, are free to come out with proof about their undeclared assets and take them away. “We are ready to gift such properties to those who come out with proof instead of spreading a smear campaign,” he added.

Lokesh said the net assets of his father, TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu , grew by Rs 87 lakh in the last one year (Rs 3 crore to Rs 3.87 crore). Though Naidu’s total assets were around Rs 9 crore, he had debts to the tune of Rs 5.13 crore, leaving his net assets at Rs 3.87 crore. “My mother Bhuvaneswari’s net assets have decreased in the last 12 months. My own assets have also decreased to Rs 19 crore from Rs 21 crore, while (wife) Brahmani’s net assets increased from Rs 7 crore to Rs 11.5 crore. My son Devansh’s net assets have grown by Rs 1 crore to Rs 19 crore. My family-owned investment firm Nirvana’s net assets have increased from Rs 6.8 crore to Rs 9 crore,” said Lokesh.

He said TDP is the only party in the country to disclose the assets of its top leaders for the past nine years. He explained that the value of the assets were arrived at the rate at which they were bought and not at current market price, since current value can rise or fall based on several socioeconomic factors. He added that the performance of Heritage group, set up by Naidu about 27 years ago to ensure that the family had financial independence irrespective of their political challenges, played a big role in the growth of their assets. He said they were taking up charitable programmes through NTR Trust.

Lokesh also wanted to know why Jagan has not been reacting to their demands to disclose his family’s assets. “Jagan’s assets were just around Rs 9 lakh according to the election affidavit filed by him in 2009 but rose to Rs 42,000 crore by the time the CBI carried out searches at his residences,” he said, while adding that Jagan has so far done only three works successfully — painting government offices with YSRC colours, attacking TDP activists, and going back on his own promises.

Erode: Gobichettipalayam farmers on Thursday demanded the district administration and the municipality to stop letting sewage water into a canal that was meant for irrigation purposes.

Talking to TOI, M Suresh Kumar, a farmer, said sewage water from Gobichettipalayam taluk was entering Thadapalli canal at more than 10 places. “At least 24,504 acres is directly benefitted from the canal water,” he said.

Pointing out that they had recently desilted the canal near Singiyam at a cost of Rs40 lakh under the Kudimaramathu scheme, the farmers said, “However, owing to unchecked sewage water flow, the canal pathway is today filled with water hyacinth and other waste.”

It is to be noted that Public Works Department (PWD) officials had started releasing water into the canal from Kodiveri dam on February 1. The farmers said the water had not reached the tail end village Singiyam so far, as the water pathway has been blocked by water hyacinth.

They said they had taken up the issue with the Gobichettipalayam municipality several times, but to no avail. “How can we use water mixed with sewage to irrigate food crops such as paddy?”

The farmers have also petitioned Gobichettipalayam revenue divisional officer Jayaraman, seeking to redress the issue. “I will convene a meeting with revenue, PWD and municipality officials to settle the issue,” the officer said.

The farmers, meanwhile, threatened to take out a series of protests if their demands were not met.

“It is an honour and privilege to have the opportunity to serve as vice-chairperson of Delhi government’s think tank.

DDC’s focus in the next five years will be to work closely with the citizens to make Delhi a 21st century city that every Indian can be proud of,” Shah said.

VIJAYAWADA: BJP’s state unit president Kanna Lakshminarayana on Thursday alleged that temples are being attacked across AP with the support of the state government. Speaking at the party’s state committee meeting, the former minister condemned the attacks on temples and sought severe action against those responsible. He also criticised the police for booking false cases against BJP activists and harassing them.

Kanna said a party delegation met DGP Gautham Sawang and complained to him against the false cases and also on the attacks on temples. However, he regretted that no action has been taken by the DGP so far. He also expressed concern over the increasing attacks and intimidation of BJP workers in the state by the police.

The BJP chief also saw the role of the state government in the targeting of temples. He alleged that evangelisation was on the rise in the state these days and the government was encouraging conversions. “Attacks on temples, evangelisation and false cases on BJP workers has the support of the state government. There is no doubt about the government’s support to these activities,” he alleged.

Nashik: The Nashik campus project of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) will soon take shape after over three years of uncertainty.

“An allocation has been made for the Nashik campus in the varsity’s budget proposal. The budget proposals would be placed before the senate in a meeting on March 14. We have concrete feedback that the state government will also make an allocation for the project in its budget,” highly placed varsity sources told TOI.

A senior SPPU official said that with the fund allocation, the work for the construction of the campus, spread across 63 acres in Dindori taluka, would start.

“The varsity is committed to making the Nashik campus project successful. Our administrative department is looking into the technical issues and resolving them with priority,” the SPPU official added.

The SPPU had conceived the Nashik project in 2017. But the project was not developed despite demands from students and faculty members of the varsity hailing from Nashik.

Recently, SPPU senate member from Nashik, Amit Patil, had taken up the issue with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and the state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant.

Patil had said that both of them had assured him that they would look into the issue seriously.

Once the campus comes up in the city, students from Nashik will not have to go to the SPPU headquarters at Pune to resolve their problems and issues

“They will have access to the authorities at the campus here and the authorities will be able to take immediate decisions,” SPPU officials said.

Currently, Nashik has one sub-centre, which is a link between the varsity and the students. But it cannot take major decisions and the problems have to be addressed at the main campus.

According to SPPU authorities, once the varsity’s Nashik campus becomes a reality, it would have an administrative set up and the students can pursue higher studies in the Nashik campus of the university.

414,['21/02/2020'],Karnataka moots ‘plug-and-play’ factories for industries,"This story is from February 21, 2020

BENGALURU: In a bid to reduce time taken for firms to launch manufacturing activity, the industries department is proposing to offer industries a slew of plug-and-play factories — pre-constructed facilities with all necessary infrastructure — across various industrial parks and estates.

These facilities will be offered on lease which will reduce industries’ upfront investment and help them channel more funds into technology and innovation. Industry members TOI spoke with said such facilities, which are common in China, Taiwan and some other countries, would be a great benefit.

Gaurav Gupta, principal secretary, industries department, told TOI: “We are looking at different models and are talking to heads of industry and other stakeholders about this. There is a lot of potential and we will have to see what kind of response we get. We cannot go about building things if there is no response.”

Gupta, while insisting such ready-to-occupy facilities will not be restricted to any one sector, said that the government may begin with various clusters it is planning as part of the flagship ‘Industrial Cluster Development Programme’.

The government intends on developing various clusters under this programme, including ones in the agriculture/food processing sector. “The idea is to help reduce the turnaround time — from the time a project gets approval to start of operations — of industries and also to attract new investments,” Gupta said.

He said the government may build these factories by floating tenders for the project, or get builders to do it. “Each model has various nuances that need to be worked out. We will work out the details once we know what kind of response we’ll get. That process is already on,” Gupta said.

Manu Jain, vice-president, Xiaomi, and managing director, Xiaomi-India said at a press conference that plug-and-play facilities in China are huge.

Devesh Agarwal, president, Bangalore Chamber of Industries and Commerce (BCIC), told TOI: “Our chamber has made two proposals to the government. One is to adopt a cluster approach, which has been taken seriously, and the second is to offer plug-and-play units. Karnataka ’s industrial policy has always been very progressive and we are glad that the government is looking into both these suggestions.”

He pointed out that this won’t be the first time Karnataka has offered such facilities to industries. “More than 40 years ago, KSSIDC (Karnataka State Small Industries Development Corporation ) had offered similar facilities in Peenya Industrial Estate. It was a massive success, but for reasons we are unaware of, it was never emulated anywhere else in the state,” Agarwal said.

Stating that the industry will welcome the initiative, Agarwal said that the department could even look at a model that allows builders to draw up an agreement with the government and build estates that have such factories.

415,['21/02/2020'],"Corporators prevail, get mayor to order resumption of works stalled by Tukaram Mundhe","This story is from February 21, 2020

Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe

NAGPUR: Mayor Sandip Joshi on Thursday directed the civic administration to lift ban imposed by municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe to stop development works irrespective of whether work orders were issued or not.

On February 13, Mundhe had told the special general body meeting that the NMC’s financial condition was very critical so he had no option but to stop development works whether work orders were issued or not. He has also stopped the administration from floating new tenders.

Though Mundhe tried to draw attention of the House by presenting NMC’s Rs496 crore liabilities till January 31 and also informed about future liabilities, the corporators felt unconvinced by his justification.

Mundhe also refuted the demand of corporators to introduce one time amnesty scheme or waive off penalty imposed on defaulters of property tax and water bills. To this, mayor assured the house that a meeting of all party leaders and senior corporators along with municipal commissioner will be convened before February 29.

Senior BJP corporator Dayashankar Tiwari demanded the civic chief to table last 12 years’ balance sheet. “Even during last special general body meeting, the mayor had given the directives to the civic chief,” he said. To this, the mayor sought information from Mundhe who sought one month to submit 12 years’ balance sheet.

Mundhe, however, continued with his justification about the stoppage of new works and explained that this year’s budget target set by standing committee of Rs3,100 crore, the NMC will hardly reach Rs2,300 crore by March end.

Tiwari demanded the mayor to ask the commissioner to table year-wise liabilities of the NMC.

Tiwari and Datke also informed the house that the commissioner cannot stop works sanctioned by the standing committee. Even the administration read out the MMC Act, which clearly mentioned that the civic chief has no power to stop works sanctioned by the standing committee.

The house also unanimously decided to send back chief accounts and finance officer Mona Thakur to her original department in state’s treasury. Recently, Thakur was given additional charge of CAFO of NMC after the civic body’s CAFO had proceeded on sick leave.

The house took the decision after BJP corporator Dharmpal Meshram brought adjournment motion demanding to relieve her from the NMC. Tabling the motion, Meshram said as per act NMC, the charge of CAFO cannot be given to any person who had earlier held the auditor’s post in the NMC and Thakur had held that position.

Corporators from all the parties supported Meshram’s demand following which the mayor ruled to send back Thakur to the state government. According to sources, the demand against Thakur was made as she held back many pending bills and suggested Mundhe to stop works following financial crisis.

The ruling party also opposed the civic administration’s proposal to sanction town planning scheme of Smart City as it has many discrepancies.

Independent corporator Abha Pande questioned over functioning of counselling centres operating in 10 zones. The NMC is spending Rs33.60 lakh per annum for running 10 counselling centres but there are many irregularities like it is not functional 24X7. Even NMC is paying water and electricity bills of these centres, said Pande. Mayor directed deputy municipal commissioner to inquire in to the allegations made by Pande and table the report before the house.

Meanwhile, the house also elected nine standing committee members: BJP corporators Vijay Zalke, Pramod Karote, Khan Nasrinbano, Anil Gendre, Rajesh Ghodpage, Pramila Mathrani, Vishakha Bante, Vikram Gwalbanshi and Congress corporator Ayesha Uike. Of them, Zalke is all set to become standing committee chairman as present panel chief Pradip Pohane will retire next month.

416,['21/02/2020'],Nagpur Municipal Corporation gets notice for building road on private land in Wathoda,"This story is from February 21, 2020

NAGPUR: A part of an internal road in Wathoda was allegedly laid on private land by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). Land owner Vinod Bangade recently erected a fence to block the road on his land, but it was demolished by NMC, fuelling another controversy.

The road in dispute links the main road connecting Inner Ring Road to Symbiosis University , with Radhakrishna Nagar at Wathoda. It is the only direct approach for residents of Radhakrishna Nagar.

Some days ago, Bangade served notice to NMC Nehru Nagar Zone and also submitted a memorandum to mayor Sandip Joshi alleging trespass by NMC on his property and claiming compensation for his land. He also announced the intention to erect a fence again to protect his land.

Bangade told TOI his ancestors owned 4.04 acre land at Wathoda since 1954. The Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) had acquired the land for Sewage Disposal Scheme in 1964, but returned it in 1997. “After disputes within the family, I paid Rs10.5 lakh to my family members in district court and got complete ownership in 2012,” said Bangade. He also created a layout with 21 plots and sold 20 of them, with the remaining 13,400 sq ft plot lying abandoned.

When his case was pending in court for years, people of Radhakrishna Nagar, which is also an unauthorized layout, had started to use his land to approach the main road. “Without any intimation to us, NIT constructed a road on it two years ago. I gathered all documents and approached NIT and NMC, but no one paid heed. I fenced the road on the two ends of my plot a couple of months ago. NMC team on January 30 demolished the fencing,” he said.

Corporator Dharampal Meshram, also an advocate, said NMC initiated the action on his complaint. “People came to me and requested to open the road as it is the only one to approach many residential areas. NMC issued notice and opened the road for traffic. I have gone through Bangade’s documents and his ownership claim seems correct. NMC should verify the documents and take appropriate action. But no one can block a road, so it should remain open till the case is settled,” he said.

Bangade has no problem in giving his land for the road but wants the norms to be followed. “NMC should have consulted me before demolishing my fencing. I incurred huge loss in the action. NMC acted after a conspiracy by few people. I should be given compensation for the land used for the road. I have verified city’s development plan (DP) and there is no road on my property,” he said.

The case has once again highlighted NIT’s improper development of unauthorized layouts. Before providing basic amenities, NIT had regularized unauthorized layouts, leaving people to suffer disputes between property owners and NMC, which replaced NIT as planning authority a few months ago.

Mayor Joshi has reportedly directed officials of Nehru Nagar zone to verify Bangade’s documents, check DP, and resolve the case.

COIMBATORE: As the sit-in against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Registry of Citizens (NRC) and the National People’s Register (NPR) entered the second day on Thursday, several hundred women flocked to the protest venue that was christened Coimbatore’s Shaheen Bagh to join the proceedings.

“This is our emotion,” said 46-year-old Shakeela Kadar pointing to 1000-odd hijab-clad women sitting under a canopy and raising slogans at the Masjid ground at Aathupalam Junction in the city.

Like most of the women there, Shakila had come to the protest venue after finishing household chores and sending children to school. “Many of us are earning members and have children, who go to school and colleges. Yet, we have come here. We are fighting for our soil. We need our soil,” she said.

Shameema Habeeb, 54, another protester, said, “The BJP government has turned ordinary public into protesters.”

Like Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, it is the emotion of women that leads the anti-CAA protest in the city. The sit-in began on Wednesday night following a massive rally against the CAA, NPR and NRC, and the state government, which the protesters said needed to pass a resolution against the draconian laws.

The women, who have gathered from Kuniyamuthur, Podanur, Karumbukkadai, Oppanakkara Street and other areas in the city, said they were determined to conduct the protest peacefully and with discipline. Shameema said, “We will protest peacefully in Gandhian way till they repeal the act. We won’t create any situation for police to intervene.”

Coimbatore’s Shaheen Bagh comes after several protests and rallies conducted by the Federation of all Jamaths and Muslim organizations in the city over the past two months. Before Wednesday’s rally, they had taken out a massive rally on February 2 from Ukkadam till south taluk office. Around 25,000 people had turned up for that rally.

Speaking of the timing of the indefinite sit-in, Shabeena Shamsudeen , 39, another protester, said, “We have been staging protests at several places, but there has been no solution. We have come here to find a solution. We will not budge till CAA, NPR and NRC are repealed.”

Men at the venue said they have foregone their day’s pay to participate in the protest. Mohammed Ibrahim, 56, said, “I work as a coolie at a glass works shop. My pay is Rs500 a day. But I have come here, as my citizenship is more important that a day’s pay.”

Mohammed Ashraf, 18, a Class XII student, said he was afraid of the future. “I’m afraid whether we would remain citizens of the country if the CAA, NPR and NRC are implemented.”

While the protest began with around 2,000 people on Thursday morning, women started pouring in as the day progressed.

418,['21/02/2020'],Chennai: DRI scanner on customs officials,"This story is from February 21, 2020

CHENNAI: The international airport in the city on Wednesday turned into the epicentre of a ‘ turf war ’ between Customs and directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) over apprehension of gold smugglers. Two customs officials are under DRI scanner , while DRI officials themselves were allegedly attacked by a mob after they seized 12.693 kg of gold valued at Rs 5.44 crore from 18 passengers.

Sources said officials of DRI, an agency whose mandate is to gather intelligence and bust major cases, went into the immigration area of the international airport to apprehend those said to be carrying the gold concealed in the rectum. A source in Chennai airport Customs said that if the passengers had reached the Customs area, they would have been apprehended by the agency, as is the norm.

The passengers apprehended by DRI had arrived by flights AK 11 from Malaysia, 6E 1212 from Colombo, EK 544 from Dubai and UL 121 from Colombo.

DRI said that as a follow-up investigation, the Kolathur house of a customs tax assistant who had recently quit his post was searched. He was allegedly co-ordinating the smuggling operation.

However, high drama prevailed once the DRI officials exited the airport arrival hall. While the officials made the 18 smugglers board a vehicle, a mob of 50 people gathered and hurled abuses at them. Two officials were allegedly manhandled and in the ensuing melee, some passengers ran away. Some were seen entering the arrival hall again, DRI said in a release. When DRI approached the airport police to file a complaint, some of the members of the mob followed them. DRI later called them to its office in T Nagar on Thursday for further inquiry and 13 of the 18 turned up. DRI said it had begun an investigation to identify the mastermind behind the racket.

While in the official release, DRI appreciated the role of Customs in effecting seizure of gold on a regular basis at the airport, customs officials are unhappy over their turf being encroached.

In the past one year, Customs had shown a 67% increase in the number of cases booked. Gold smuggling cases booked saw an increase of 116%, compared to the previous year, with Rs 123 crore worth gold being seized. Moreover, 14 wildlife seizures, especially of exotic animals, were also made by Customs.

former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan

NAGPUR: In an indication towards growing fissures in the Congress, former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said the party suffered immensely due to nomination culture brought in the Congress Working Committee (CWC) after Sonia Gandhi took over as president in 1998. He is second Congressman after senior party leader Shashi Tharoor demanded that the polls should be conducted for party president’s post.

During his courtesy visit to TOI-MT office on Thursday, Chavan further admitted that the probe into multi-crore irrigation scam, which he had first launched as CM, wouldn’t progress much since those facing accusations “were in power”.

While demanding to conduct polls for CWC’s 10 elected members, he said only then good state-level leaders would come out. “During tenures of former premier PV Narasimha Rao and Sitaram Kesri, there used to be polls for CWC’s ten seats from where good leaders like Madhavrao Scindia and Rajesh Pilot had emerged. There used to be 10 elected and 11 nominated seats on the CWC, but now all are nominated members. The coterie around Gandhi didn’t let the polls to be conducted in all these years, due to which good leaders are not emerging.”

Citing examples of how the “good leaders” were denied opportunity, Chavan said, “In Haryana, former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda was brought back as the party’s chief just five months prior to the polls. Of course, the party needs younger and energetic leaders, but experience shouldn’t be ignored. NCP supremo Sharad Pawar is the best example of vast network of supporters,” he said.

“In Madhya Pradesh, after appointing Kamal Nath as CM, the state chief’s post should have been granted to Jyotiraje Scindia or his close aide from the party. In Rajasthan as well, there are same issues, which could be sorted out,” Chavan added.

Speaking on Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), Chavan made a startling claim that had BJP retained power in the state, it would have spelt doom for the Congress and the NCP as the former had destroyed its strongholds sectors like cooperatives, dairy and sugar. “They had also carried out many defections from our party. Ex-CM Devendra Fadnavis had made full preparations of ending our domination had he come back. I was the first one to convince Gandhi on forming the government, although she was reluctant. It wasn’t easy to stitch an alliance but we came together with the only aim of keeping the common enemy (BJP) away from power.”

Explaining the party’s stand on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the ex-CM said they would oppose it tooth and nail. “PM Narendra Modi’s image has taken a hit due the ongoing protests. His dream to come at par with former US president Barack Obama is over. It (CAA) was brought with a view to polarize the people.”

Opposing CM Uddhav Thackeray’s stand of allowing National Investigation Agency (NIA) to take over the Elgar Parishad probe, Chavan said MVA should have constituted SIT for incident. “NIA’s track record is worst, although we can’t stop it from taking over as per the NIA law.”

COIMBATORE: Goldsmiths in the city welcomed the State government’s decision to set up a gold jewellery industrial park here. The park will give a boost to the sector, which has been facing a decline from the last decade due to competition from big corporates, they said.

Minister for rural industries P Benjamin had recently made the announcement in the State assembly regarding the park, to be set up in Perur in Thondamuthur constituency.

It was a long-standing demand, said managing director of Coimbatore Gold Jewellery Cluster S M Kamalhasan. “There were 50,000 micro jewellery units in the city and two lakh people depended on the sector. In the last few years, several people had to abandon the profession and find other jobs mainly due to competition from big corporate jewellers,” he said. The park will bring together all micro goldsmith units in the city and provide more stability and security for them. It will help develop the sector and also attract the next generation,” he said.

The proposed Coimbatore Gold Jewellery Cluster on Vysial Street, undertaken by goldsmiths, will have the latest machinery and infrastructure for jewellery making. It is in the process of getting final approvals. “Once the industrial park is established, we will shift our cluster to the campus,” Kamalhasan said.

Mahashivaratri

NAGPUR: The early morning calm will become more peaceful and pious as devotees of Lord Shiva offer prayers and panchamrut (a mixture of five ingredients) amid the fragrance of essence sticks at temples on the holy occasion of Mahashivratri today. Lord Shiva temples across town have geared up to welcome devotees lining up to offer prayers.

Temples and their surroundings in the city are draped in the colours of celebrations, as devotees and Shiv bhakts would offer prayers and witness ‘abhishek’ and pujas. On the darkest night of the year, devotees stay awake and offer prayers, perform rituals and pay obeisance to Lord Shiva.

Nikhil Tandulkar, a sevak at Prachin Shiv Mandir in the city, expressed his excitement about the holy festival, “Our temple is very old, and carries a special place in the hearts of the devotees. The puja begins at the temple at around four in the morning, followed by Rudra-Abhishek and aarti.”

Shivlakhan Solkar, another sevak at a local Shiv Mandir, added, “Devotees look forward to attending the abhishek, we offer bhasm, leaves, flowers and chandan to the pind of Shiva. We have made adequate arrangements for prasad, as thousands of devotees come each year.”

Devotees fast and pray to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. While performing abhishek, they bathe the Shiva Linga with milk and flowers. “The Shiv lingam or pind is bathed with the five sacred offerings of a cow, called the ‘panchagavya’ — milk, sour milk, urine, butter, and dung at the temple. We have decorated the premises with flowers and installed railings so devotees can come in a proper queue to offer prayers,” said Dinesh Pedliwar , member of Shiv Mandir Panch committee.

Shivratri has a special significance for the city and areas surrounding it, as there were a large number of Nag temples here. Nandu Sontakke, from Shiv Mandir, Katol Road, explained the religious significance of the day and offered a glimpse into the tasty feast that will be distributed to the devotees.

“People feel inner peace and calm after visiting the temple on this pious occasion. We will serve rabdi, halwa, rice and other prasad to the devotees. The temple is expecting footfall of over 10,000 devotees, like every year. And each one will be an equal partner in the celebration,” he said.

Apart from the beautifully decorated temples, citizens also celebrate Mahashivratri at homes with great excitement. “We offer bel patra, three in numbers, and flowers to the linga. Later, the family members come together to chant ‘Maha mrutunjay jap’. It fills the house with warmth and positivity,” said Akshata Nakshine, a law student.

The total water demand pleaded and established by Goa is 145tmc ft

KERI: While the Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Centre to notify the award given by the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal on August 14, 2018, Goa continues to fight a tricky battle.

The state’s contention is very clear and it has already filed a special leave petition on July 18, 2019, in the hope that things might go its way.

Goa has taken objection to the tribunal’s 2018 decision allotting Karnataka 13.4tmc ft, including 3.9tmc ft for drinking purposes through diversions, against its demand for 7.5tmc ft. It has maintained that the detailed project report for diversion of water to Malaprabha, submitted by Karnataka government, has many factual inconsistencies.

The state has established that the demand for its human consumption is 94.02tmc ft and for maintaining environment flow, the estimated requirement is 50.11tmc ft. The total demand pleaded and established by Goa is 145.16tmc ft. The tribunal has allowed Goa a mere 33.395tmc ft for human use.

In 1993, the Central Water Commission conducted a study of water availability in all rivers, estimating the average water availability in the Mandovi basin at 146.17tmc ft. Goa has found the yield estimated by the tribunal on the higher side.

BS Yediyurappa

BENGALURU: Chief minister BS Yediyurappa admitted in the assembly on Thursday, that the state is facing a serious financial crisis and the government has been forced to “rationalise funds” allocated to “certain” constituencies by the coalition regime.

During a debate on the government suspended development work, PWD minister Govind Karjol, who provided a break-up of allocations, said constituencies of JD(S) legislators had been allocated six to 10 times more funding by the coalition government headed by HD Kumaraswamy .

“While Holenarsipura was allocated Rs 200 crore, Ramanagara got Rs 193 crore and Sakleshpur got 183 crore,” Karjol said. “However, other constituencies in coastal and north Karnataka were only given between Rs 20 crore and Rs 30 crore. To remove this discriminatory, we decided to suspend certain work in one constituency and use the same funds elsewhere.”

While objecting to the suspension of the development projects, Kumaraswamy, JD(S) floor leader, candidly admitted allocations were heavily in favour of constituencies of JD(S) legislators.

He justified it saying, “We were out of power for 10 years and there were development works which remained unfinished. So when we came to power, we allocated more to our constituencies. This has been the norm not only with our political party but with all others as well.”

BJP members immediately raised objections, claiming Kumaraswamy was “biased” and had ignored north Karnataka. However, Yediyurappa intervened and calmed tempers by admitting what Kumaraswamy had said is true.

“It is a fact that whichever party comes to power and whoever becomes the CM, he generally allocates more funds to his own constituency and his home district. This has been the case not today, but forever,” Yediyurappa said.

But Yediyurappa justified suspending projects sanctioned by the coalition government by admitting a shortfall in revenue and insisting financial management is imperative.

“I assure you that no projects sanctioned during the coalition government will be stopped. However, for now, due to the financial concerns, we are suspending it. We will take it up soon once the situation improves,” Yediyurappa said.

The CM had hardly finished when Bengaluru legislators from Congress and JD(S) said there were cuts in constituency allocations under various heads. Kumaraswamy claimed the government had allocated Rs 50 crore each to BJP constituencies, but not to segments headed by opposition parties. Former industries minister KJ George backed Kumaraswamy. Yediyurappa promised to set right the discrimination.

Earlier, a war of words broke out between Karjol and former PWD minister HD Revanna over allegations that projects worth thousands of crores were tendered without finance department approval.

While Revanna said he had never issued any tenders without FD clearances, Karjol said projects worth Rs 6,300 crore were on-going without finance department approval.

But the debate remained inconclusive with JD(S) and Congress seeking a white paper on the issue.

Vijayawada: The National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) bench on Thursday criticized the Union environment ministry and termed their claims that certain irrigation projects in AP didn’t require clearances as ‘ambiguous’.

Shravan Kumar, the advocate representing the petitioners, argued against the government for allowing the construction of Purushothapatnam , Pattiseema and Chintalapudi lift irrigation projects. He said the environment suffered ‘irreparable damage’ due to the projects that cannot be estimated.

After hearing the arguments, the four-member NGT bench led by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel ordered the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee to submit a detailed study in consultation with Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

They asked for the report to be submitted within a month’s time and posted the next hearing to May.

NEW DELHI: In a strict action against unrecognised schools in north Delhi, the civic agency has given a deadline of one month for registration.

In an order published on Thursday by North Delhi Municipal Corporation ’s education department, it has been clarified that all such private as well as aided schools should get themselves registered till March 31 else they will face major penalties of over Rs 1 lakh.

According to an estimate, there are about 3,000-5,000 unrecognised schools operating in various neighbourhoods in north Delhi , each having an average of 200 students.

“As per the provision of Section 18 of RTE Act, 2009, schools cannot run without any legal recognition certificate. If any unrecognised school is found to be operational after March 31, then penalty of Rs 1 lakh will be imposed. In case of further violation, penalty of Rs 10,000 per day will be imposed on the violator,” stated the order.

All students enrolled in unrecognised schools will be admitted in nearby government or recognised schools after the action is taken.

Meanwhile, a delegation of school owners on Thursday met the north corporation mayor and expressed concern over the short deadline given to obtain the registration certificate.

“We will soon hold a joint meeting of the officials concerned and the school owners to find out a solution as the matter concerns future of thousands of students,” said Avtar Singh, the mayor.

Representative image

COIMBATORE: The district administration is all set to revive the local complaints committee (LCC), that was formed based on the Vishaka guidelines, to address sexual harassment of women at workplace.

A complaint box will be placed at a prominent place inside the collectorate on Monday, collector K Rajamani, who called a meeting with the officials, said. “We plan to revive the committee,” he said.

Referring to the anonymous complaints the administration had received, the collector said that not just the working women, anyone can deposit complaint letters in the box. “Even anonymous letters will be taken up for inquiry.”

As per the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, government departments, private companies and educational institutions that have more than 10 women employees, should have internal complaint committee (ICC). A district-level committee called LCC should be formed to monitor them.

While ICCs should have three members with a woman employee as its head, the district-level committee should consist of five members – collector, district social welfare officer (DSWO), two representatives from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and an advocate.

TOI had earlier reported that the committee had not received even a single complaint even though it was formed in 2014.

An official from the committee said that even though more than 75% of the government departments and a few private companies had formed the committees and submitted quarterly reports, not even a complaint was registered through the committee. “We had investigated a couple of sexual harassment complaints. But they were addressed directly to the collector and not to the committee,” the official said.

431,['21/02/2020'],"Nagpur Mayor Sandip Joshi starts process to denotify Itwari, Mahal as slums","This story is from February 21, 2020

Nagpur Mayor Sandip Joshi

NAGPUR: Mayor Sandip Joshi on Thursday directed Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) administration to start the process to de-notify Itwari, Mahal and areas alongside Central Avenue from the list of recognized slums of Nagpur city.

He gave the ruling after former mayor Pravin Datke raised the issue of rise of unauthorized constructions in Mahal despite serving notices under relevant sections of Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act and Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Authority. He also drew attention that on July 20, 2017, the house had decided to denotify slums where all basic amenities had been provided. “But even after two years, the administration has failed to take any decision,” Datke said.

TOI had highlighted that commercial areas such as Sitabuldi, Sadar, Mahal etc are still marked as slums in state government and NMC records, and continue to get backward class funds while actual slums are deprived of basic amenities.

Datke informed the house that there is no rule to take action against unauthorized constructions in notified slums. Since Mahal is still part of slum, many property owners take undue advantage of this rule and indulge in unauthorized constructions. Even new multi-storey commercial shops are coming up without any provision for parking spaces.

Since the administration had failed to denotify these areas despite development, corporators are utilizing backward class development funds, and residents are availing subsidized services.

As per NMC records, there are 484 slums across the city, of which 295 are notified where slum dwellers are entitled to subsidized services like drinking water and property tax.

Endorsing Datke, senior BJP corporator Dayashankar Tiwari too drew the attention of the house to similar situation in other notified slum areas like alongside Central Avenue and Itwari.

Datke also raised the issue of zonal offices issuing notices to unauthorized constructions under sections 52, 53 and 54 of MRTP Act, though most of the owners have obtained stay by appealing in urban development ministry.

Following this, mayor Joshi directed the civic administration to start the process to denotify developed areas like Mahal, Itwari, Central Avenue from the list of slums. He also asked all assistant municipal commissioners to submit action initiated against unauthorized constructions in their respective zones.

Representative image

NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Thursday reserved its order on the Bhim Army’s petition against the police refusing permission for a rally at Reshimbagh Grounds, next to the RSS’ centre. The judges also pulled up the cops for not relying on any specific reason, such as intelligence inputs or other grounds, to refuse clearance.

One of the reasons mentioned by the police in its affidavit for refusing permission was that Bhim Army professes an ideology opposite to that of the RSS. Holding a protest at a site next to the RSS administrative centre could lead to a law and order disturbance due to the differences, it said. The police expressed readiness to grant permission for any other site.

The court observed that mere difference of ideology of any organization located close by cannot be a reason for denial of permission for a rally. “Rather the police should have come up with a stronger case, it said. Suppression can prove to be adverse and such protests on the other hand provide a safety valve,” observed justice Sunil Shukre. The petition was before the division bench of Shukre and justice Madhav Jamdar .

The Bhim Army plans to hold a rally on February 22, where issues like CAA-NRC and reservation will be discussed by speakers. One of the speakers is the outfit’s chief Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan, who has been at the fore-front of anti-CAA-NRC protests and also in midst of controversies. The organizers have given an estimate that 10,000 persons would gather for the event.

Even as the outfit got permission from NIT, which has jurisdiction over the ground, the police denied approval citing law and order reasons, leading to Bhim Army moving the court.

In a later development, RSS-leaning organization Lok Jagruti Morcha and other outfits have planned a rally at Sakkardara Chowk, around a kilometre away from Reshimbagh on the same day. RSS sources, however, clarified that the organizers were an independent outfit.

Bhim Army’s counsel Firdaus Mirza argued that denial of permission was a violation of the fundamental right to protest. He said the very intent of denying permission was mala fide. The police is ready to allow the Bhim Army to hold the event at any other site but not at the Reshimbagh Grounds. Mirza argued that if the event did not pose a threat to law and order at any other site, then how could it be so only at Reshimbagh Grounds. Mirza also argued that there is no specific law barring such rallies.

The proceedings also revealed that the police had also denied Bhim Army permission at two other sites, Chitnavis Park and premises of Hazrat Mazoom Shah Dargah nearby, in Mahal, where the RSS headquarter is located.

Ketki Joshi, the government lawyer, arguing for the police, said that the Bhim Army had not stated its agenda for the meet. Even as it has been billed to be a workers’ meet, it did not appear to be purely a gathering of the outfit’s cadre. Joshi said the petitioner had also hidden the criminal antecedents, as the district chief of Bhim Army Praful Shende had faced charges of not abiding with lawful directions in two cases. She also expressed concern about the credentials of Ravan, given the background of offences registered against him.

KOLKATA: The state public works department (PWD), implementing the Majerhat road overbridge (ROB) reconstruction project, on Wednesday submitted a host of documents to Eastern Railways (ER) that will be sent to the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS).PWD officials on Thursday told TOI that Railways has passed on the documents to CRS, which in a letter to ER on January 13, refused approval for building the Majerhat ROB’s superstructure, pointing out 31 procedural and technical lapses. PWD is trying to fix some of these issues. The state agency has sought help from the Railways so that some of the objections can be ‘overlooked’.The CRS, under the ministry of civil aviation, gives safety clearance to any railway project across the country. The PWD needs its nod to start building the superstructure by launching girders over the railway tracks.A span of the ROB, which comes within the ambit of Eastern Railway (ER), collapsed on September 4, 2018. The new bridge, being built since January last year, has already missed two deadlines. The Bengal government has held Railways responsible for the delay. On November 25 last year, CM Mamata Banerjee wrote to railway minister Piyush Goyal seeking his intervention to expedite ER’s nods for building the bridge’s superstructure over the tracks and in getting the CRS sanction. But now, the crucial CRS approval is pending with the civil aviation ministry. Railways merely acts as a messenger between the state government and the CRS, which won’t give its go-ahead unless all its objections have been taken care of.A PWD official said, “ER is supposed to submit the documents provided by us to CRS with the plea that if all the issues raised by CRS need to be addressed now, then the bridge’s commissioning will be delayed further.

NAGPUR: Opposition and ruling corporators were at loggerhead over the NMC’s anti-encroachment drives. Raising the issue, Praful Gudadhe said that of the 10 zones, Laxmi Nagar, Nehru Nagar and Lakadganj zones have no authorized vegetable markets.

With a population of 30 lakh, the city has only eight weekly and four daily designated markets. Hence, citizens have no option but to buy vegetables from vendors doing business on roads and footpaths, he said. Hence, he suggested that the NMC should first designate markets before resorting to action against encroachers.

He maintained that the NMC should not launch anti-encroachment drive against illegal hawkers when it is yet to set up town vending committee. Gudadhe faced stiff opposition from ruling party corporators including Dayashankar Tiwari, former mayors Pravin Datke, Nanda Jichkar who said that the administration should keep roads free of all encroachments.

Mayor Sandip Joshi ordered the administration to identify places reserved in city’s development plan for markets and also asked to speed up the process for setting up town vending committee.

The bridge over Tolly Nullah; the expansion of the width of the approach road resulted in the narrowing of the... Read More

KOLKATA: Cops, along with KMDA, are banking on a recent RITES report to finally begin operations on the bridge connecting Karunamoyee Bridge and Siriti in the Tollygunge area, the construction of which was finished around five months ago.

The RITES report revealed that there is no obstruction in the flow in the Tolly’s Nullah due to the bridge, rebutting activists’ claim that widening of the road had hindered the normal flow. It was on this ground that the bridge was not opened — as activists knocked on the doors of the green bench and forced KMDA to get a survey carried out by an independent agency.

This has led to daily traffic congestions, especially in the evenings. The MG Road stretch towards Haridevpur bears most of the brunt. Cops now hope that diverting at least autos via the narrow bridge will help take off load in the zone. With two major high-rises in the area and buses routes multiplying, following the Majerhat bridge crash, managing traffic has become a challenge there, conceded Lalbazar sources.

KMDA sources said that they also want to have talks with the police to see if the canal bridge can be opened for traffic. “As per the RITES report, there is no obstruction in the flow of water due to the bridge,” said a source.

The Karunamoyee canal bridge has remained closed, following an NGT order last year.

Green activist Subhas Dutta said he did not object to the bridge. “I only object to the connecting road that has been widened. Instead of widening the canal, its width has been narrowed,” he said, adding that he plans to challenge the findings of RITES at the NGT.

KMDA had set up the Rs 7-crore bridge over Tolly Nullah at Karunamoyee. Work of setting up the bridge had started in November 2018. It was inaugurated on September 30 last year, only to be closed a day later as the approach road was not wide enough for vehicles to ply smoothly and it would have created traffic snarls during Puja.

Police, meanwhile, are urging vehicle owners to use the Izzatullah Lane Bridge from the Prince Anwar Shah crossing. “Vehicles coming from Prince Anwar Shah Road can take the Izzatullah Lane Bridge directly, avoiding Tollygunge Phanri and Tollygunge Circular Road,” an officer from the south-west traffic guard said.

The right half of the bus was completely ripped off, killing most passengers sitting on that side

COIMBATORE: A deafening crash jolted him awake and sent him hurling. P Jordin Xavier, 38, from Nemmara in Palakkad district , said if he and his wife Anu Mathai had got seats on the right side of the bus their names would have been among the deceased. Jordin, who was returning from Bengaluru, got away with injuries in the hands and legs.

Jordin said they were returning home after his wife wrote an exam in Bengaluru on Wednesday for a job in Saudi Arabia. “We were in seats no 19 and 20. We were deep asleep. We suffered minor injuries in the collision. We were in shock after seeing many passengers lying dead in their seats,” said Jordin.

The couple were rescued by fire and rescue services personnel and were admitted to the Tirupur Government Hospital. Around 1 pm, the couple left for their home town.

Siddhu Malawad, 44, from Bengaluru, an employee of an MNC company, said he was fast asleep and didn’t know how the accident happened. “When I woke up after the loud noise and the jolt, all I could see was blood soaked passengers, some dead and some unconscious,’’ he said. Survivors are in a state of trauma.

He said he was on an official visit to Kochi from Bengaluru. “All the passengers had been deep asleep. After the crash, passengers in the front seats were lying dead. I helped the rescuers and later I was treated as an outpatient in a hospital near the accident spot,” said Siddhu Malawad.

K Vijayakarthikeyan, Tirupur collector, said two possibilities are being cited as reasons for the accident - the driver was asleep; and the rear tyres of the container truck burst. He said he has instructed the regional transport officer to conduct an inquiry into the cause of the accident. Addressing media persons at the Tirupur Government Hospital, he said 25 passengers were injured and they were admitted to various hospitals. Their condition is stable.

Death certificates have been issued immediately to family members of the victims.

D Balamurali, Palakkad collector, said: “The Kerala government will bear the medical expenses of the injured passengers. Those who suffered minor injuries will be sent home after treatment. People who suffered major injuries will be transferred to hospitals in Kerala after getting the opinion of doctors and their relatives,” said Balamurali.

439,['21/02/2020'],Wedlock amidst deadlock,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Days after the anti-CAA protest venue at Old Washermanpet in Chennai hosted a marriage, Coimbatore’s Shaheen Bagh turned into a wedding venue for 24-year-old Abdul Kalam and 19-year-old K Reshma Shirin on Thursday. Immediately after the bride and groom took their marriage vows, they shouted slogans against the CAA.

Their marriage was fixed three months ago and like any other couple, they were planning to get married in a marriage hall. However, the current political climate forced them to change their plans.

On Thursday, their marriage was solemnized under a canopy at Athupalam Junction that was erected to provide shade to around 2,000 people, who are protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Registry of Citizens (NRC) and the National People’s Register (NPR).

The couple said they wanted to get married at the venue, “amid people”.

Abdul Kalam, the groom, who is a vegetable dealer from Kuniyamuthur, said, “When everyone is protesting, it didn’t feel right for us to get married in a hall. We are happy that we got married in the presence of such a large crowd, but at the same time we are sad that we had to start our married life here because of such laws. There are several others like us. We don’t want this to happen to them. The CAA, NPR and NRC should be repealed.” he said.

On her part, Reshma Shirin, of Karumbukkadai, said they were happy that they could send out a statement through their marriage. “We think our nikkah was revolutionary. We want the CAA, NPR and NRC to be repealed,” she said.

Representatives of Jamath organizations said the families of the bride and groom had decided to have the marriage at the protest venue to express their solidarity with the ongoing anti-CAA protests.

The marriage was conducted as per Islamic tradition. The groom gave a 25g gold chain as ‘Mahr’, a customary offering to the bride. Representatives said the marriage was held in a simple way, in which all Islamic marriages should ideally be held.

On Monday, Shahin Shah and Sumayya had got married at the anti-CAA protest venue at Old Washermanpet in Chennai.

440,['21/02/2020'],Nagpur court grants bail to Fadnavis on Rs15k PR bond,"This story is from February 21, 2020

Nagpur: Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday managed to get the bail from chief judicial magistrate’s (CJM) court in the case of allegedly suppressing information on two pending criminal cases in an affidavit for 2014 assembly polls.

While allowing his application for bail, CJM PS Ingle directed the former CM, who was present in the court after being granted last chance, to furnish a personal release (PR) bond of Rs15,000. Before scheduling the next hearing on March 30, he was told to appear in subsequent hearings as and when directed by the court.

The onlookers, including the lawyers and litigants, crowded district and sessions court’s premises since the news of ex-CM attending the hearing went viral on the social media. The police had maintained strict security and even personnel from the riot control force were present at the spot to prevent any untoward incident.

Fadnavis, who was made an accused in the case, arrived with senior counsel Sunil Manohar and lawyer Uday Dable at about 11.15am and presented himself in the CJM’s court. His trusted allies, including former power minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule and MLC Parinay Fuke, accompanied him along with other BJP activists from the city.

“Presence of the accused is secured. There seem to be no chance of absconding. As the offence in bailable, he may be granted bail,” the judge said before adjourning the hearing.

Earlier, arguing for the South West MLA, Manohar submitted a bail application contending that his client had already filed a review petition in the Supreme Court on whose orders the case was remanded back to trial court.

Stressing that the apex court had reserved the orders in his case, Manohar requested for bail to the accused on PR bond till the verdict comes out.

Strongly opposing this, applicant Satish Uke argued that Fadnavis had thrice skipped the hearings on December 4, January 4 and February 10 citing various excuses. Pointing out a similar case involving Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, he contended that the former had faced jail and was released on a bond of Rs15,000.

Further stating that he had filed a contempt case against Fadnavis for skipping the court summons, the applicant requested the court of applying law of equality to all.

Later talking to the media, Uke denied any political controversy in the entire issue. “If he loses, he could face a jail term of six months or Rs10,000 fine or both,” he said.

Uke had accused Fadnavis of alleged failure to mention summary case no. 232 of 1996 (u/s 500 of IPC — defamation) and regular criminal case no. 343 of 2003 under various sections of IPC, which were pending before the JMFC.

Before remanding back the case to JMFC court for retrial on October 1 last year, the SC had ruled against Fadnavis clarifying that a candidate must disclose all criminal cases in which court has taken cognisance at the time of contesting election. JMFC judge SB Mehta had issued summons to the ex-CM as an accused and asked him to remain present on December 4 for seeking bail.

441,['21/02/2020'],"NCP confusing people on Elgar probe, says Devendra Fadnavis","This story is from February 21, 2020

Devendra Fadnavis

NAGPUR: Flaying NCP supremo Sharad Pawar ’s demand to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe Elgar Parishad case, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday accused the party of confusing people.

Pawar had opposed National Investigation Agency ’s (NIA) decision to take over the case, and home minister Anil Deshmukh had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to oppose NIA, and requested him to form the SIT. The CM, however, cleared the way for NIA, which led to differences between the two coalition partners.

“The ruling dispensation isn’t interested in the findings, but only wants to confuse the people. Once NIA has taken over the probe, there is no need for another probe. The NIA has concrete evidence against the accused and therefore the CM has heeded to its request,” Fadnavis told TOI.

The ex-CM was in the city after being summoned by the chief judicial magistrate’s (CJM) court.

Fadnavis said the two complaints against him mentioned by the applicant were of private nature, including defamation. “Those were filed over a protest for public causes of slum dwellers in Gokulpeth area, back in 1996-97 and in 2003. Now, both cases have been disposed of.”

Explaining the first case, the southwest Nagpur MLA said it was filed when he went to save slums from getting demolished, since he was corporator of that area. “Since it was related to a land of a former government lawyer, he had filed defamation case against me. The other one is related to tax payment over ULC surplus land, which was again a private one.”

He said that his lawyers, who prepared his affidavit in 2014, told him that only cases which could have impacted the polls should be disclosed. “In all five assembly elections, I won with over 50% majority. So there is no question of any impact of private complaints. In fact, I had also sought information under the RTI Act from cops regarding cases filed against me, and even they failed to mention these two complaints. But they’re not at fault as they were never discussed for nearly two decades from 1996 to 2014,” he said.

Speaking on Maha Vikas Aghadi ’s (MVA) loan waiver scheme, the opposition leader said it was an extension of the schemes launched by the BJP government with some changes. “We will be cornering the ruling dispensation on various farmers related issues, including the loan waiver,” he said.

Kolkata: Meaningless messages, images and GIF forwards on WhatsApp groups created by Bidhannagar Police as a mode of daily interaction between Salt Lake residents and local cops, senior police officers have started texting block representatives to ask group members to refrain from posting such forwards that ultimately override important messages.

Set up in September last year, after a meeting between Salt Lake block representatives and senior officers of Bidhannagar Commissionerate led by police commissioner LN Meena, cops had formed separate WhatsApp groups for 50 odd blocks in Salt Lake with the officer in charge of local police station, a sub-inspector and president, secretary, treasure, assistant secretaries and vice-presidents of the blocks as group admins. One member from each household in the block was added as a group member. Each group has anything between 150 and 250 odd members.

“The main idea behind the formation of the group was to disseminate information to general public as well as a channel where residents can directly speak of their grievances and report traffic-related issues or illegal activities in their area directly to cops. However, everyday the groups get flooded with random messages. At times, people stop checking the groups, which can ultimately lead to some important information among a cluster of forwards go missing. Hence we have asked the group members to refrain from sending forwards,” said a senior police officer.

A police officer, who is also an admin in one of the groups, said may people forward these messages to everyone in their contact list at one go. “Most of them do not realise that such messages are a nuisance and cause inconvenience to others,” he said.

Prodded by the cops, the group admins have started sending out messages stating: “This is to inform you that this group has been created to highlight any law-and-order problem in your neighbourhood. Request members to refrain from posting messages not relevant to the group.”

“The group has been extremely useful. Time and again, we point out problems related to traffic and other problems in blocks and lanes and cops do take action. The cops also inform any issue of importance via this group. But such has been the barrage of useless messages that several members I know have put this group on ‘mute’ mode, missing out important information. We have requested members to refrain from posting unrelated messages but they seldom listen,” said Basab Aich, the president of BE Block Residents’ Association.

NAGPUR: Mayor Sandip Joshi ordered to regularize 1,800 contractual sanitary workers who have completed 20 years of service and has also directed to adjust all the 315 surplus teachers in other civic-run schools.

Both the orders were fallout of unanimous decisions by both ruling and opposition corporators demanding the House to regularize all the 4,407 daily wagers sanitary workers as the administration had stopped their absorption citing financial crisis. Besides, the administration informed the House that due to some errors it could not regularize all of them and said that papers of 1,800 daily wage sanitary workers were found OK.

The mayor directed the administration to give appointment letters to 1,800 daily wage sanitary workers on March 2, the foundation day of the NMC.

Corporators also said that most of the schools in the city — either run by the civic body or zilla parishad — are witnessing dropouts and as a result schools are being shut down every year. So no schools will absorb surplus NMC teachers. Instead, the NMC should adjust them only in its schools.

The mayor also directed the administration to initiate the process to convert six Marathi medium schools into English state board patterns. The mayor also directed the administration to start the process to convert three schools into CBSE pattern as suggested by civic chief Tukaram Mundhe .

449,['21/02/2020'],"Supreme court admits Goa’s plea, but says notify tribunal award: Mhadei","This story is from February 21, 2020

Representative image

Panaji: The Supreme Court, in an interim order on Thursday, directed the Centre to notify the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal ’s final award of August 14, 2018, but said it was subject to the outcome of the petitions filed by the riparian states—Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra—against the award.

The Supreme Court also admitted Goa government’s special leave petition challenging the award and posted it for final hearing on July 15, 16 and 24.

During the hearing, the Supreme Court bench comprising justices D Y Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta raised a technical point to ask how a state could challenge the award when it was not notified and does not have legal force, advocate general Devidas Pangam told TOI.

In its SLP, Goa has sought quashing of the tribunal’s award allotting 3.9tmc (thousand million cubic) ft water to Karnataka for drinking purpose.

Experts said that with the apex court likely to finalise the hearing within five months and deliver its verdict thereafter, it will not be easy for Karnataka to go ahead with its water diversion plan, especially as the apex court has made it clear that the award of the tribunal will be subject to its judgment.

While chief minister Pramod Sawant put out a terse tweet saying the matter has been fixed for July 15, Union minister and Dharwad MP Prahlad Joshi welcomed the order and said he has requested his colleague in charge of water resources Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to take steps and notify the tribunal award.

Karnataka, which has locked horns with Goa on the larger issue of sharing Mhadei water, had petitioned the tribunal seeking release of 7.56tmcft of water for Kalasa-Bhandura canal project. Goa opposed it, delaying notification of the tribunal order.

“The order is a major step in the long struggle of Karnataka for fair share of Mhadei waters. Once the tribunal award is notified, Karnataka can take up construction of drinking water project without hurdles,” a senior Karnataka water resources officer said.

In its petition, Goa has also asked for interim relief to stop Karnataka from proceeding with the construction of bunds at the Kalasa nullah in Kankumbi, and to restrain it from diverting water from the Mhadei basin to the Malaprabha basin.

Goa had taken objection to the yield of the Mhadei basin calculated by the tribunal, as its plea for the exclusion of a catchment area of 509sqkm from the coastal region was not considered.

The state had argued that, due to tidal action, a part of the Mhadei in the coastal region is affected by salinity and that some of the catchment drains directly into the sea without rainwater collecting in the river.

In August 2018, the three-decade old dispute between the three states over sharing of the Mhadei water ended with the tribunal rejecting Karnataka’s demand for 36.5tmc ft of water and allotted it only 13.4tmc ft, including 3.9tmc ft for drinking purposes through diversions, against its demand for 7.5tmc ft.

But the tribunal also made it clear that diversion would be permitted only during the five monsoon months—from June 1 to October 31. “Even if some inflows are observed into the reservoir(s) during the non-monsoon period, no diversion is permitted out of the inflow during the non-monsoon period starting from November 1 to May 31,” the tribunal headed by justice J M Panchal had observed.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan has will stay on the FATF grey list until June 2020, after which it could slip into the blacklist, As the global body to fight terror financing wound up its plenary in Paris, Pakistan has been told it could go into the blacklist if it failed to complete its 27-point action plan, diplomatic sources told TOI.Of particular concern to FATF is Pakistan’s failure to make significant progress in prosecuting and penalising terrorist financing. If Pakistan fails to take credible action by June, the FATF has warned that it could call on its members and urging all jurisdiction to advise their financial institutions to give special attention to business relations and transactions with Pakistan. As in the October 2019 plenary, the language used is identical to that used on Iran , which is currently in the blacklist.Pakistan and the Imran Khan-led government had promised to its people that they could get out of the greylist in February. Pakistan stayed out of the blacklist with three countries, China, Malaysia and Turkey, speaking out for it. But to get out of the greylist, Pakistan needed 13 countries to vouch for its efforts. Pakistan had lobbied hard, and many countries would have spoken in its favour. But on technical grounds at least, with evidence of money trail that put a lie to its claims, Pakistan could not claim clemency.Pakistan had arrested hafiz Saeed of LET days before the FATF plenary to show commitment. ON Thursday, Pakistan was told that it had to convincingly prosecute and convict the top leaders of all terrorism groups as mentioned in the Action Plan, sources said.This could put Imran Khan and Pakistan’s ISI in a spot, with their credibility coming under serious question, even within the country.Specifically, Pakistan has been asked to show action on eight following areas:First, demonstrate that remedial actions and sanctions are applied in cases of anti-money-laundering/terror-financing violations, relating to terrorist financing (TF) risk management.Second, Pakistan has to show that “competent authorities” are cooperating and taking action to identify and take enforcement action against illegal money or value transfer services (MVTS).Third, It has to demonstrate implementation of cross-border currency and bearer-negotiatiable instruments (BNI) controls at all ports of entry, including imposing effective sanctions.Fourth, Pakistan has to demonstrate that law enforcement agencies (LEAs) are identifying and investigating the widest range of TF (terror financing ) activity and that TF investigations and prosecutions target designated persons and entities, and those acting on behalf or at the direction of the designated persons or entities.Fifth, it has to show that TF prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions; sixth, implement targeted financial sanctions (supported by a comprehensive legal obligation) against all 1267 and 1373 designated terrorists and those acting for or on their behalf, including preventing the raising and moving of funds, identifying and freezing assets (movable and immovable), and prohibiting access to funds and financial services.Seven, it has to demonstrate enforcement against TFS violations including administrative and criminal penalties and provincial and federal authorities cooperating on enforcement cases.Eight, Pakistan has to show that facilities and services owned or controlled by designated person are deprived of their resources and the usage of the resources.In Video: Terror funding bites back as Pakistan stays on FATF grey list, gets June 2020 deadline",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74234191,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-271445,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pak-stays-on-fatf-grey-list-sees-june-deadline-on-terror-could-slip-into-black-list-after-june/articleshow/74234192.cms

VASCO: The Mormugao Municipal Council (MMC) on Thursday installed machines to treat 1.5 lakh cubic metres of waste dumped at Sada. The treatment process will take around six months.

Minister for waste management Michael Lobo, who launched the machines, said the treated wet waste would be sent to Karnataka for electricity generation.

Transportation of such waste to Karnataka would cost the Goa government Rs 22,000 per truck, he said, even as he announced that the state would soon have plants of it own that would use wet waste to generate electricity.

The minister also said that waste management plants are in the process of being set up in many parts of the state.

He said that although people object to the establishment of such plants due to apprehensions of foul smell, odours are generated only when garbage is accumulated for days. “Such dumps are actually threats because an epidemic can break out at any time,” he said.

Mormugao MLA Milind Naik, who was also present at the launch, said garbage from all of MMC’s 25 wards is being dumped at Sada, creating problems for residents and hospitals located area.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant

PANAJI: The state government has granted permission to open a casino in a starred hotel at Kadamba plateau. Home department sources said that it would be the ninth onshore casino in the state.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant cleared the file to start the 29-table 100-capacity gaming club. It will have 17 electronic card games, four roulettes, five slot machines and a money wheel. The total occupied area is below 300 sqm.

The government had earlier granted 11 licences to onshore casinos out of which three shut after the government hiked various licence fees in March 2018.

Out of the nine casinos, eight are being operated in North Goa. While the state government has capped the number for offshore casinos, there is no such restriction on granting licence to onshore casinos so long as they meet the government criteria.

From February 1, Goans have been banned from entering gambling areas in casinos, except those working on them.

The state government had appointed gaming commissioner to monitor the operations of casinos and to check if Goans are going to the gaming facility.

The state government has yet to come out with the rules for the functioning of gaming commissioner. Sources said that the gaming commissioner rules files have been sent to law department for vetting before it is notified.

In June 2015, the home department had first drafted the rules in which there was a provision to arrest any person under 21 entering casinos.

It was in June 2012 that the state government passed the amendment to the Goa Public Gaming Act, 1976 by introducing the Goa Public Gaming (Amendment) Bill, 2012.

PANAJI: The limits of formaldehyde for 63 species of marine and fresh water fish have already been set by the food safety and standards authority of India (FSSAI), New Delhi.

The food safety and standards (FSS) (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011, are being amended to add ‘Limit of Formaldehyde’- the naturally occurring formaldehyde for 63 different species of fish, the FSSAI informed the high court of Bombay at Goa on Thursday.

“The amount of naturally-occurring formaldehyde for 63 species has been laid down under sub-regulation 2.6.2 of FSS Amendment Regulations, 2020,” assistant director of FSSAI Pankaj Gera submitted to the high court.

During the hearing on Thursday, counsel representing FSSAI, Dattaprasad Lawande, told the court that a total of 693 samples of fish have been analysed till date by the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT), Kochi to determine the naturally-occurring formaldehyde in fish.

On the request of petitioners that no checks of formalin in fish are being carried out, the high court asked the government to place the reports of random checks before it. Senior counsel J E Coelho Pereira told the division bench that the laboratory to test the presence of formaldehyde in fish at the SGPDA market in Margao, should in fact be set up at the wholesale market.

Under its Rs 54 lakh collaborative research project ‘Natural level of formaldehyde in freshly harvested fin fish and shellfish’ initiated on July 3 last year, the FSSAI is expected to set formaldehyde standards for 72 major commercial species of fish which contribute to more than 90 percent of the fish production and consumption in India.

The central authority is expected to complete the exercise by August this year after analysing more than 1,000 samples of fish.

NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Thursday put on hold the appointment process of principal in Almora’s Adams Girls Inter College.

A bench comprising Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe was hearing a petition which alleged that the institution is a government-aided college and therefore, it cannot restrict appointments of various posts for one religion or any specific section of a religion. The petition said applications were sought for the principal post, but later they were informed only a Methodist could be appointed to the post.

""The petitioner filed the application but she was later informed that only a Methodist can be appointed to the post. She was left with no option but to approach the court,"" said Harendra Belwal, the counsel appearing for Preeti Lal, the petitioner.

While the institution argued in the court that the right to choose the principal rests with them since the college is a minority institution, the court did not agree with the argument. The court said that an unaided institution may be free to put such procedure in place for the appointment, but not in this case as the institution is government aided. The court said that the condition put forward “does not accord with law.” ""As to whether such institutions are entitled to confine the appointment to the post of principal in its college only to a particular sect of Christians, excluding others including Christians who do not belong to that particular section, necessitates examination… We are prima facie of the view that such a condition stipulated by the fifth respondent (the institution) does not accord with law,"" the court said.

The high court stayed the appointment of the new principal and has given the college three weeks’ time to file its response.

However, despite the CM’s directive, not a single minister turned up on Wednesday. Transport minister Yashpal Arya was the only minister to come to the assembly building on Thursday.

The CM meanwhile came to the assembly building on both days to meet the people. A communique from the CM’s office said that the chief minister interacted with numerous people including physically challenged persons who acquainted him of the problems they are facing. When queried about the absence of ministers, the CM told mediapersons, “Most ministers are currently out of station or busy on assignments in their respective constituencies. We expect a better turnout from next week.”

Transport minister Yashpal Arya said that it was a good exercise to solve public grievances. “As far as I am concerned, I devote my maximum time to people in my office as well as constituency,” he said.

Opposition Congress, however, did not fail to take potshots at the ruling party over the issue. Congress state vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana said, “This makes two things clear.

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath on Friday inaugurated a ‘model gaushala’ in Umarhar village of Chhindwara and said that his government is working not only for protection of cows but with the goal that ‘gaushalas’ become a means of generating income in rural areas.

“Cowsheds are being constructed in all panchayat headquarters across the state. We fulfilled the promise made in the manifesto soon after formation of the government,” Nath said.

Addressing a public meeting there, the CM attacked PM Narendra Modi and former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. “For 13 years, Shivraj Singh Chouhan made false promises and announcements. And PM Modi misled people in the name of nationalism. But people now know the truth. I believe in work, not in making announcements,” he said.

Nath said he will never let down the people of Chhindwara, a Lok Sabha constituency he represented for nine terms in Parliament. “Chhindwara will never have to be ashamed because of me. Be proud, thump your chest and say you belong to Chhindwara,” he told the cheering crowd.

The Umarhar cow shelter has been built by the state government at a cost of Rs 30 lakh. CM Nath reiterated his government is committed to protection of cows. Along with promoting organic farming with ‘gaumutra’ (cow urine) and cow dung, marketing of various cow products will also be promoted. Chhindwara district will get 31 such cow shelters, he said.

“The government is working with a new attitude and approach for development, and Chhindwara model has been made the basis for that progress. An investment-friendly environment has been created for generation of employment, which has started yielding results. For this, process related to establishment of industry have been simplified. This has increased the confidence of investors in Madhya Pradesh,” he said.

A day earlier, the Nath cabinet passed a bill for time-bound clearances of investment proposals, which is expected to boost industrialization and employment generation. When it becomes an Act, it will be the first such in the country, say sources in the government.

On Friday. the chief minister said that efforts are on to improve the level of education to connect youth with employment and self-employment.

Chhindwara MP Nakul Nath — Kamal Nath’s son — and ministers Sukhdeo Panse and Lakhan Ganghoria attended the function.

MUMBAI: Five drunk men stopped the car of a female managing director of a production house and her three women colleagues when they were driving back to their Andheri West homes early on Thursday.

The men jumped out of a police van stationed a few metres from Oshiwara police station and stopped the car, claiming to be police informers , and made vague inquiries.

Ritika Bajaj, MD of the production house, took to Twitter to report the harassment. She tweeted: “Five Drunk Men in one police van - stopped us while driving back from a late-night shoot. They were not even wearing the uniform and were claiming to be Police Informers. And of course, they were trying hard to get money, or maybe more because the car had four women! Trying to do all kind of antics, of clicking pictures making videos to scare us and god knows what rubbish they were blabbering!”

Oshiwara police called Bajaj after reading the tweet to record her statement late on Thursday.

While Bajaj did not respond to TOI attempts to contact her. her friend Dharmesh Thakkar, a mediaperson, said, “It was a terrifying moment for Bajaj and her friends who were returning from a shoot in Goregaon. They were stopped around 3.45am on Thursday and the five men harassed them after getting out of a Mumbai police van at MegaMall junction near Oshiwara police station.”

Thakkar said her three colleagues had planned to take an autorickshaw but accompanied her after she insisted on dropping them home. “The women locked the doors of the car when the miscreants began to bang on it. They left only after the women began to scream,” he said. Some of the women clicked photographs of the men on their cellphones which Bajaj shared with the police.

After the police recorded her statement, Bajaj tweeted: “Thanks so much for full support everyone @MumbaiPolice reached out to me and The support received has sorted everything for me! I am happy that I live in a city where approaching police is easy and actions are taken quickly!” Oshiwara police senior inspector Dayanand Bangar confirmed they have recorded Bajaj’s statement and launched a probe into the incident.

Divya Pawar

BHOPAL: An international boxer from Bhopal, Divya Pawar, has failed a dope test in Qatar. The Madhya Pradesh sports department on Friday said the 17-year-old boxer was unaware that an energy drink she had taken had a banned substance.

Pawar had won gold at the International Golden Gloves Boxing Tournament in Serbia last year and a bronze at Asian Youth Boxing Championship in 2018. Sources say she tested positive for higenamine, a potentially harmful cardiovascular stimulant prohibited by World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

Pawar hadn’t responded to TOI’s message till the report was filed.

Her sample was taken during a championship in Qatar last December and the results declared on Friday.

Sports director-in-charge Vinod Pradhan said: “She is a promising boxer. I am told that she took an energy drink from Bhopal before going to the Qatar championship last year. She says the energy drink specially mentioned it was ‘dope free’.”

Divya had informed the doping agency and deposited the bottle, he ssid. Divya’s coach Roshan Lal did not respond to TOI’s calls.

R B Udayakumar

CHENNAI: The state government has sought clarification from the Centre on new questions added for carrying out the National Population Register ( NPR ) exercise, said revenue minister R B Udayakumar in the assembly on Thursday. “We are yet to receive reply,” he said.

The government has not yet fixed dates for rolling out NPR in Tamil Nadu, he said. The issue was raised in the zero hour by leader of the opposition M K Stalin . “While several state assemblies have passed resolutions against the Citizenship Amendment Act, you (speaker) are not allowing us to move such a resolution in the House. The state government should at least stop rolling out NPR because it is actually National Register for Citizens (NRC) in disguise,” said Stalin.

Udayakumar said in the new NPR format, four new queries regarding dates of birth and places of birth of parents of citizens, their mobile numbers, Aadhaar and driving licence details have been added. Those queries were not there in the 2010 NPR. “People need not show any documents as proof for their answers. Similarly, answering these questions is not mandatory,” said Udayakumar, who was seen taking inputs from chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami.

The minister accused the DMK of trying to mislead the people, especially Muslims, on CAA and NPR by creating a false narrative, all with a view to secure their votes. “We have assured people in the past, and once again, we assure them that CAA will not affect any Tamil citizen living in the state,” said the minister.

Stalin, however, said CAA was anti-constitutional and should be withdrawn. NPR is being planned to target Muslims and Lankan Tamils, he said. Officials raise doubts about claims of citizens who don’t answer queries in NPR. Queries regarding festivals in NPR are aimed at identifying the religion of citizens, he said and demanded that it should not be carried out in Tamil Nadu.

Accepting Palaniswami’s challenge to give the names of any Tamil Nadu citizen affected by CAA, Stalin said he was ready to provide the list of names if the government would give assurance that NPR would not be rolled out in the state. As no assurance was given by the government, the DMK staged a walkout.

Representative image

HARIDWAR: To build a ‘golden temple ’ for ‘Ram Lala’ in Ayodhya, Param Dharm Sansad 1008, founded in 2018 by Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati has now launched a campaign to collect gold to the tune of 1,008 kg from seven lakh villages across the country.

“Of the total 1,008 kg, about 108 kg will be used for construction of ‘ Bal Mandir ’ to which Ram Lala is likely to be temporarily shifted. And the remaining 900 kg will be given to the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, the trust constituted by the government to build Ram temple at Ayodhya,” said Avimukteshwaranand, who is secretary of the Ramalaya Trust. The Trust was set up by Swaroopanand a few years ago.

Avimukteshwaranand claimed that in the government trust, no Shankaracharya or eminent seers have been included. “It is only dominated by RSS-VHP-BJP members. They are in too much of a haste to complete the temple construction so that they might reap its benefit in the 2024 parliamentary polls.”

According to the seer, the plan is to collect at least a gram of gold from each village under the ‘Ram Ram gram gram yojana’ for the ‘Bal Mandir’. “For collection of gold, people will be given authority letters,” he added.

Meanwhile, VHP zonal organising secretary Manoj Verma said on Thursday that the gold collection is Param Dharm Sansad’s own initiative. “The organisation itself will be responsible for any such collection as no appeal for any donation has yet been issued by the trust authorised by the Supreme Court for temple construction.”

VHP international vice-president and Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra general secretary Champat Rai called the gold collection “illegal”, as the declaration of the campaign was made before constituting the trust by the government as per the apex court’s order.

Tourism department found fresh wind in its sail after chief minister Ashok Gehlot announced to create a fund of Rs 100 crore to promote the sector. The industry breathed a sigh of relief as in the previous Budget, the chief minister had ignored the sector by not allocating enough funds for marketing and promotion.

Additionally, he said the government will announce an “Ease of Travelling in Rajasthan” policy. While he gave no details of the legislation, stakeholders in the industry said that it could be the policy the department is already working on.

Tourism has been a lifeline of the state’s economy which supports host of other sectors like handicraft, gem and jewellery, hospitality, etc. The state tourism department has found a new spring in its step after Jaipur was recognized by UNESCO as world heritage city. Additionally, the state tourism department has signed an agreement with the UNESCO to promote intangible heritage of the western Rajasthan.

“The Budgetary support was needed as the sector is facing now multiple headwinds. On the top of economic slowdown, the corona virus has also disrupted the flow of tourists. Marketing and promotion is the key to attracting tourists and the funds will come handy,” said a hotelier which has witnessed cancellations of groups due to corona virus.

The chief minister also allocated a Budget of Rs 4 crore to conserve and renovate four properties of Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation. Siliserh Lake Palace in Alwar, Castle Jhoomar Baori in Ranthambore, Gokul in Nathdwara and hotel Sarovar in Pushkar will be benefitted under the scheme.

Doctors treating her, however, refrained from making any comment on her condition and have sought at least two more days before giving any opinion regarding her actual state. Her attendant at AIIMS, seer Dayanand, said that on regaining consciousness, Padmavati has now been put on sedatives.

“The doctors said that she is trying to remove the oxygen pipe on gaining consciousness. Maybe the pipes are making her uncomfortable and that is why she is reacting in this way.” Meanwhile, another seer of the ashram Aatmabodhanand who has also been fasting for a free-flowing Ganga has declared to quit drinking water from Wednesday evening, alleging that security given to Matri Sadan head Shivanand Saraswati has been removed.

JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday allocated Rs 14,533 crore to the health sector for developing infrastructure, enhancing human resources, improving delivery of services, reducing out-of-pocket expenditure and bringing new machines for diagnosis of diseases and functioning of organs.

This year, apart from focusing on Nirogi Rajasthan scheme, the state government has given impetus to organ transplant. As of now, Sawai Man Singh Hospital has facilities for organ retrieval from brain dead patients. Now, the state government will develop organ retrieval centres in Udaipur, Kota, Ajmer and Bikaner. Also, Jodhpur’s Mathuradas Mathur hospital has been authorised for organ transplant.

Gehlot has also proposed a gastro surgery department for developing liver transplant facility in SMS Hospital. For the purpose, the state government has already signed a MoU with the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi.

The CM also announced upgrade of 69 junior resident posts into senior resident posts.

A major boost for medical education has also been proposed. Gehlot said 15 new medical colleges are in the pipeline in 15 districts. Land has already been allotted for the institutes.

“The importance given to health in the budget is historic. In my opinion, there has been a great emphasis on preventive health which will be hugely effective in the long run, both for the government and the citizens of the state. Infrastructure, HR, delivery of services and reducing out-of-pocket expenditure of the common man on health are the main pillars of the healthcare in a benevolent government system. I think all these have been adequately taken care of in this budget,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary, health department.

The government will provide momentum to Nirogi Rajasthan campaign as it has allocated Rs 100 crore for the Nirogi Rajasthan management fund.

A new department is also coming up at Sawai Man Singh Hospital — nuclear medicine department for diagnosis and for finding out the functioning of organs. It will help in diagnosis of brain and bone disorders and heart problems and some cancers of brain and bones. The state government has proposed Rs 10 crore digital subtraction angiography machines, which will benefit patients suffering from brain tumour cerebral angiography and stenting.

A multi-storey (ground plus eight) cottage wards will be constructed at SMS Hospital by demolishing the existing cottage wards with a cost of Rs 28crore.

After Jaipur, it is Jodhpur where healthcare will be improved. At MDM Hospital, Jodhpur, CM has proposed a Rs 46-crore OPD block. Also, four new wards, each having a capacity of 30 beds each, will be constructed at a cost of Rs 11crore.

Agra: Local residents, who were issued passes for their vehicles by the road transport authorities to ply within 500-metre radius of the Taj Mahal, have been facing restrictions on their movement in view of the US President Donald Trump’s February 24 visit. A Supreme Court order of 1998 had banned entry of all private vehicles within 500 metres of the Mughal-era monument, following which local residents living in proximity of the Taj Mahal were issued passes allowing their vehicles to ply.

Local resident Sandeep Arora, who has a valid vehicle pass, however, said that he was stopped on Wednesday night and was told that due to security reasons, no vehicle would be allowed in the restricted zone till February 24. “Denying us permission to ply our vehicles for five days is like a house arrest,” he said.

Raju Kohli, who lives in Tajganj, told TOI that his residence is just 62 metres from the West gate of the Taj Mahal and he has a valid special permit that allows his vehicle to ply within the prohibited zone. “When I asked the security personnel the reason of stopping my vehicle, I was told that there were orders from the higher authority not to allow any vehicle within restricted zone of the Taj Mahal,” he said.

Following the 1998 SC order, the road transport officer was directed to identify the records, number of vehicles of the local residents and as to which of them should be permitted ingress and egress within 500-metre zone of the Taj Mahal. The officer was also directed to insist upon the vehicle owners to use stickers granted to them.

Besides, local administrative and other official vehicles have also been directed not to move frequently and try to restrict their movement as US security officials are raising issues of movement of vehicles in the prohibited area.

Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh told TOI that there is no complete ban as such on movement of vehicles in the restricted area. “We are just regulating the movement and advising residents not to make frequent trips in the area because of security reasons,” he said.

CHENNAI: Five years ago, G Kodhainayagi opened her doors to Rajathi, a client of Better Chances, a Chennai-based NGO promoting holistic wellbeing of people with mental health issues.

The 40-year-old had been diagnosed with acute schizophrenia after her parents died within two months of each other, and her elder brother could no longer handle her psychotic episodes.

Rajathi had quite a temper, didn’t like being told what to do, and was spaced out a lot. But she also wore great makeup, loved gardening and watched the 9pm serial without a miss. Today, these are among the things that define her friendship with Kodhainayagi.

""She is part of the family now. She shares her kitchen recipes with me and I ensure she takes her medicines on time,"" says Poorna Chandrika, director Institute of Mental Health, who has also empowered their clients to live on their own.

480,['21/02/2020'],'Indian 2' shooting accident: Where death lurks behind the scenes,"The crane fell on crew members of ‘Indian 2’ at the EVP Film City near Poonamallee

CHENNAI: Wednesday’s crane accident on the sets of ‘ Indian 2 ’, which left three dead and 10 more injured, is an eye-opener for the film industry which seldom follows safety norms. .Angamuthu Shanmugam, general secretary, Film Employees Federation of South India (FEFSI), which comprises around 25,000 workers/technicians from 23 union representing various crafts of film production, blamed the use of an industrial crane for the tragedy and improper maintenance of the floor at EVP.According to police, the crane used was 100ft tall. “We have been asking Tamil Film Producers’ Council (TFPC) to utilize the services of FEFSI members. We provide training in using new equipment including 40ft and 60ft cranes. In this case, an industrial crane was deployed and the floor was weak, resulting in the accident,” he said.As tragedy struck home, Kamal Haasan was unsparing in his criticism. “When we spend hundreds of crores of rupees making films, it is despicable that the film industry does not provide basic protection for its lower rung workers. Personally, this (the accident) is an insult to me.”Leading art director Sabu Cyril said such accidents should be wake-up calls for movie crew. “In Mumbai, a scaffolding cannot be more than 35ft high. Not sure if such rules are followed in the south. This rule was implemented after an accident and Bollywood adopted safety on sets as a byword. In foreign locations, nobody can take rules for granted. The governments concerned are strict and monitor the movements of people. Safety audit happens at shooting spots. In Dubai, an inspector visits the spot to make sure no untoward incident occurs,” he said.Stunt master Peter Hain said accidents on sets are not a single person’s error. “It is unfortunate that lives were lost, but the takeaway from this episode is people, no matter how big or small, must take their safety seriously. Mostly, the stuntmen don’t care about their wellbeing. They are willing to take risks, not understanding how their family may suffer if anything goes awry,” he said.A veteran art director, who did not want to be named, said the way things were going in the industry, anything can happen anytime. “Everything happens in a jiffy. There is no thought process. Double call sheet, overworked technicians and zero concern for their lives are a recipe for disasters. Only now light boys have got ladders, otherwise they had only ropes to hang for safety. Now, they have steel grids to walk without getting hurt,” he said.Film producer S R Prabhu said life matters more than money. “This is an accident. No one wants to be careless. Actors and stuntmen insist on an ambulance and the presence of a doctor when shooting for stunt scenes. Insurance has become a key thing,” he said.As ‘Indian 2’ was insured, the family of the deceased would get ₹10 lakh each (besides the ₹1 crore Kamal has promised for the three families together). “We pushed them to take insurance. Unlike Bollywood, not all producers opt for insurance here, which is not seen as a priority by them,” says K Abhishek Bharati, a business consultant enabling sale of key insurance products to the film industry.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74236354,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-585822,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/where-death-lurks-behind-the-scenes/articleshow/74232762.cms
481,['21/02/2020'],MSRTC’s e-buses to stay off Pune-Mumbai route,"This story is from February 21, 2020

MSRTC’s e-bus service is expected to start only by June (File photo)

PUNE: While the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) isn’t ready to ply e-buses between Pune and Mumbai yet, a private entity has decided to operate 20 e-buses on the route by the end of the year.

“We feel that there is no need to run e-buses between Pune and Mumbai. We have the Shivneri bus service on this route and it is doing a good job. There is no logic in stopping the Shivneri service to launch e-buses. The e-buses will be launched on the Pune-Nashik, Pune-Kolhapur and Pune-Aurangabad routes,” a senior MSRTC official told TOI.

Earlier, MSRTC officials had stated that e-buses would ply in the ghat section after certain technical issues were taken into consideration. “There will be studies and some test runs before we take a decision on whether to run e-buses on the Pune-Mumbai section,” Ranjit Singh Deol, former vice chairman and managing director of MSRTC had said.

Last week, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari launched the first e-bus on the Pune-Mumbai route, making it the first inter-city e-bus service in the country. Prasanna Purple Mobility Solutions Pvt Ltd has started the e-bus service. Prasanna Patwardhan, chairman and managing director of the company, confirmed that more e-buses are expected to ply on the route.

“One bus now starts from Kothrud in Pune at 6am and goes to Borivli. The same bus returns at 5pm. We will get another bus within a fortnight. We aim to have at least 20 e-buses between Pune and Mumbai by this year,” said Patwardhan.

MSRTC officials, meanwhile, said that its e-bus service is expected to start only by June. “We have some buses right now but we need to set up charging points. There has been a slight delay in setting up the charging stations as many approvals are needed. 12 charging points are to be set up at the Pune headquarters by May. During the same period, Kolhapur , Nashik, Aurangabad and Solapur divisions will also get two, seven, six and three stations respectively,” the official said.

A source, however, pointed out that the launch of the service may be delayed. “MSRTC has floated tenders to set up charging points and the process is expected to be completed by May. It seems doubtful that they will be able to start operations by June as many a times, re-tendering needs to be done,” the source said.

Jaipur: A separate fund of Rs100 crore has been proposed for rehabilitation of children who are rescued from child labour and those who need support and care of the state government. It is for the first time that any state has proposed a separate budget for children, said officials of Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR).

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot in his budget speech said that Rs100 crore is proposed for Nehru Bal Sanrakshan Fund.

RSCPCR member Vijendra Singh said that nowhere in the country is there a separate fund for rehabilitation of children.

“Usually, the fund is proposed for women and children collectively but not solely for children. Such a separate budget will be helpful for children who are rescued from child labour, or those who need support and care after being sodomised or raped or those abandoned by their parents on streets and hospitals,” he said.

While announcing the budget for children, Gehlot said the funds will also be utilised for preventing child labour, child trafficking and other such activities.

Councillor’s husband protests, detained

MOHALI: Why did the Indian Air Force not demarcate 100-metre land from the defence installation boundary wall in 1960? If it was illegal, then why MC allowed constructions in the airport’s vicinity? Why did the government charge fee to sanction building plans? Why did the MC charge property tax if structures were unauthorised?

These were some of the questions raised by the owners of structures in Zirakpur that fall within the 100-metre radius.

Owners of 83-odd structures, out of which 12 were demolished on Thursday, asked why 100-metre radius from the defence installation boundary wall was not left by the Indian Air Force when the land was acquired in 1960?

Home to the newly-raised Number 42 and 44 Squadrons, 12 Wing Air Force Station was established on March 1, 1961. Since then, it is one of the premier transport bases in the IAF. Over the years, the pride of the IAF’s heavy-lift fleet — An-12s, Il-76s, Mi-26s — were stationed at 12 Wing. The station was carved out of the land belonging to the residents of Pabhat village in Zirakpur after they were compensated.

Affected by the drive in Pabhat village, Jagjit Singh, Ramesh Kumar, Anil Kumar, Pardeep Bhardwaj, Bharat Bhushan and Harpreet Singh Preet , asked in unison if all these structures were illegal, then why their construction was allowed and why the government accepted requisite fee for sanctioning their building plans. “The Air Force did not cordon off the 100-metre area with a barbed wire in 1960. It means they did not see the threat, which after 60 years they are seeing,” they said.

The owners demanded that the government as well as the civic body be made party to their case and booked for fraudulently accepting fee and property tax for structures marked illegal.

Many owners came up with building plan orders approved in 2018. The structures were declared illegal two years ago. Questioning the working of the civic body, they said if the structures were illegal, then why did the government approve plans?

Led by Satnam Singh of NGO Punjab Against Corruption, architect Ranjit Singh and advocate Rajwinder Singh , chairman, Punjab Human Rights Organization , they alleged that the government was attempting to challenge its own scheme of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana by forcing residents to become homeless.

Representative image

JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday allocated Rs 14,533 crore to the health sector for developing infrastructure, enhancing human resources, improving delivery of services, reducing out-of-pocket expenditure and bringing new machines for diagnosis of diseases and functioning of organs.

This year, apart from focusing on Nirogi Rajasthan scheme, the state government has given impetus to organ transplant. As of now, Sawai Man Singh Hospital has facilities for organ retrieval from brain dead patients. Now, the state government will develop organ retrieval centres in Udaipur, Kota, Ajmer and Bikaner. Also, Jodhpur’s Mathuradas Mathur hospital has been authorised for organ transplant.

Gehlot has also proposed a gastro surgery department for developing liver transplant facility in SMS Hospital. For the purpose, the state government has already signed a MoU with the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi.

The CM also announced upgrade of 69 junior resident posts into senior resident posts.

A major boost for medical education has also been proposed. Gehlot said 15 new medical colleges are in the pipeline in 15 districts. Land has already been allotted for the institutes.

“The importance given to health in the budget is historic. In my opinion, there has been a great emphasis on preventive health which will be hugely effective in the long run, both for the government and the citizens of the state. Infrastructure, HR, delivery of services and reducing out-of-pocket expenditure of the common man on health are the main pillars of the healthcare in a benevolent government system. I think all these have been adequately taken care of in this budget,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary, health department.

The government will provide momentum to Nirogi Rajasthan campaign as it has allocated Rs 100 crore for the Nirogi Rajasthan management fund.

A new department is also coming up at Sawai Man Singh Hospital — nuclear medicine department for diagnosis and for finding out the functioning of organs. It will help in diagnosis of brain and bone disorders and heart problems and some cancers of brain and bones. The state government has proposed Rs 10 crore digital subtraction angiography machines, which will benefit patients suffering from brain tumour cerebral angiography and stenting.

A multi-storey (ground plus eight) cottage wards will be constructed at SMS Hospital by demolishing the existing cottage wards with a cost of Rs 28crore.

After Jaipur, it is Jodhpur where healthcare will be improved. At MDM Hospital, Jodhpur, CM has proposed a Rs 46-crore OPD block. Also, four new wards, each having a capacity of 30 beds each, will be constructed at a cost of Rs 11crore.

CHANDIGARH: Online fraudsters have duped the private secretary of MP Kirron Kher of Rs 80,000 on the pretext of activating his debit card, police said on Thursday after registering a cheating case.

Oma Kant Tiwari, the MP’s private secretary, said in his police complaint, “I had received a new debit card on January 20, 2019, but did not activate it. Later, I received a phone call from a man who introduced himself as Rajbir Singh, an employee of SBI Bank. Promising to activate the debit card, he sought my bank account as well as the card details. After I gave him the information, I started receiving messages of withdrawal of money from my account. First, Rs 49,500 were withdrawn and then Rs 9,999 each in subsequent three transactions.”

After receiving the messages, Tiwari, a resident of Phase VI, Mohali, contacted the bank officials and got his ATM card and account blocked.

Even as he had filed a cheating complaint at SSP public window on January 21, 2019, the police registered an FIR on Thursday after verifying the facts.

On September 5, 2019, police had booked four persons of Uttar Pradesh for duping the UT DGP’s cook of Rs 17.18 lakh after promising him huge profits on an investment in a radio taxi company.

On September 4, 2019, online fraudsters posing as SBI employees had cheated retired Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh High Court Manmohan Singh Liberhan, a resident of Sector 9, of Rs 2.25 lakh after obtaining his bank details.
