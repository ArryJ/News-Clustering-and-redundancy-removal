0,['19/03/2020'],"Sasikala Nedungadi: Sargam combines the authentic elements of mohiniyattam, kathakali, sopana sangeetham","We have seen Sasikala Nedungadi both on the big screen in movies like Prathi Poovankozhi and on stages as a veteran kathakali artiste, who has collaborated with biggies like Kalamandalam Gopi and Kalamandalam Hyderali. The artiste, who has been performing kathakali for about 37 years, has joined hands with many across disciplines for interesting projects, over the years.

Recently, her collaboration with sopana sangeetham performer Eloor Biju for the jugalbandi show Ardhanaareeshwaram had garnered a lot of accolades, and their performance also paved the way for yet another interesting experiment. Sasikala will team up with upcoming mohiniyattam artiste Athira Shanker to put together a show named Sargam, which should go on floors soon. “Sargam brings together the pure elements of mohiniyattam, kathakali and sopana sangeetham to offer a novel, artistic experience,” says Sasikala.

She remembers, “It’s after a staging of Ardhanaareeshwaram at Changampuzha Park that Athira spoke to me.” Athira probed the possibility of putting together a kathakali —mohiniyattam fusion performance and Sasikala, who also had similar thoughts, was excited at the prospect. Sasikala says, “I have always felt the movements of women’s characters in kathakali are quite like those in mohiniyattam. Once Athira came aboard, we added mohiniyattam elements too to Ardhanaareeshwaram and also put together another piece named Navarasanjali, an item based on nine rasas. A show featuring them all, named Sargam, was supposed to get staged recently. It currently stands postponed due to the coronavirus alert.”

The artiste, who has worked with the likes of Kalamandalam Krishnan Nair, Padmabhooshan Kalamandalam Ramankutty Nair and more, began learning the art form when she was in Class five from Kalamandalam E Vasudevan Nair. “My father was the founder of Cochin Cultural Centre, where kathakali was performed daily. My life was punctuated then by stages, classes and school.” By the time she was 17, Sasikala had shared stage playing women characters with many legends. “I could study the art in depth with those like Padmashri Kalamandalam Krishnan Nair for three years, who trained me a great deal on abhinaya and it further increased my love for kathakali,” she says.

After she got married at the age of 23 to medical practitioner Devidas Vellodi and started living in Kozhikode, Sasikala took a 13-year-break from the art to focus on kids and family. “The city didn’t have many opportunities to explore the art form either. But once we came to Kochi in 1999, things changed. “My brother was running the Cochin Cultural Centre at that point. In another four years, my daughter Sruthi Devdas, who also fell in love with kathakali after watching it like me, performed her arangettam,” recalls Saskikala. Within a while, Sasikala also applied minukku (kathakali make-up) and shared stage with her daughter. “That has been my best moment on stage. We performed the characters of Seetha and her son Kushan, and the joy was beyond measure.” Since then, Sasikala says, she has been performing nearly 25 veshams on stage, every year.

The artiste says she loves characters with karuna rasa shades the best. “My favourite characters include Kuchela Pathni and Damayanthi from Nalacharitham Nalam Divasam. When I perform them, I travel through various emotional layers and says at times, some characters really upset me.” She had earlier choreographed Edassery’s Poothapattu where her daughter Sruthi performed Unni and she did Nangeli. “It shook me a lot,” she says, adding that now her biggest desire is to perform with her granddaughter. “She is just three-years-old now, and always says she wants to perform with ammoomma,” says Sasikala, who has also acted in films like Sunday Holiday and Vijay Superum Pournamiyum.

Co-living spaces remain open, but no precautionary measures are in place

In their attempt to help contain the spread of Coronavirus in the city, residential colleges have asked students to vacate the campus, paying guest accommodations are shutting down to adhere to the government directive on COVID-19. Working professionals living at the many co-living spaces in the city are wondering if it is a good idea to continue living there when precautionary and safety measures are yet to be put in place. With these developments, both students and young working professionals in the city seem to be left in the lurch. Here’s a lowdown…“While campus closure is a necessary step, college authorities should ensure safe passage for outstation students to return home. We are apprehensive about travelling now, because you never know where and how one might get infected. But we also don’t know where to stay in the city until the situation gets better and classes are resumed,” says Biswadeep Ghosh (name changed), a third-year student at the Indian Institute of Science. Media professional Riya Sethi (name changed), was given all of two days to vacate her paying guest accommodation. “I was completely blindsided by this ultimatum. I was scared, because the landlady seemed to be in panic and in a hurry to lock up and leave. Thankfully, a friend who lives nearby allowed me to move in at such a short notice. We have not been told when the accommodation will be available again. As of now, it will be shut for three weeks.”Speaking to us on condition of anonymity, a caretaker of a co-living space in Bengaluru says that he has not received any specific instructions on how to handle this crisis from his employers . “In fact, residents have been asking why I am not wearing gloves and masks while cleaning their homes, common facilities, or collecting garbage, among others. Eventually, a resident offered me a mask, which I have been using now,” he says.Most co-living spaces have fingerprint sensors as a level of security, allowing only residents to access sections of the spaces or enter the building. Twenty-five-year-old Shivshankar Machiraju, from Hyderabad, is in a dilemma now, whether to touch the surface and risk his health, or to keep the door open. “The fingerprint sensor is used by 45 other residents to enter the main gate of the co-living space. If we leave the door open, anyone can come go as they please and that’s not safe. But fingerprint sensors aren’t either and no alternate arrangement has been made,” he saysSoumitra Ghayal, a 26-year-old BTM Layout resident, shares a 1-BHK flat with a roommate. He says, “Apart from a text message wishing us well and asking us to be safe, the company running this co-living space has not done anything else to ensure our safety. If we are being charged for maintenance every month, shouldn’t a share of that be utilised on disinfectants for the building and sanitisers for residents?

Mysuru, one of the state’s biggest contributors to the tourism industry, has been severely impacted by the shutdown. Popular tourism spots like the Mysuru Palace, Krishna Raja Sagar Dam and Brindavan Gardens, Hampi, Gol Gumbaz, Badami, Aihole and Patadkal and jungle safari destinations like Bandipur and Nagarahole national parks are now closed for tourists.Before the Mysuru Palace was closed for visitors, registered footfalls were on the decline, owing to the corona scare. In the first 12 days of March, the number of tourists who visited the Palace was 68,308, a decline of close to 10,000 in comparison tho the same time period last year (78,108). The situation is no different at the world heritage site Hampi and UNESCO recognised Badami, Aihole and Pattadkal. As per the statistics provided by the Archaeological Survey of India, on average, Gol Gumbaz gets 2,200 tourists, including foreigners, in the month of March, but that number was down to 1,444 even before entry was barred for visitors. Deputy Director of Tourism Department, Mallikarjun Bhajantri, says, “The closure is only for a week. We will reassess the situation to see if we can allow visitors to these tourist hot spots in the coming days.”Nearly 40% percent of Mysuru’s local economy is dependent on tourism, not only because it is home to a number of must-visit spots, but also because it is an ideal stopover for tourists heading to Ooty and Madikeri, among others. Stakeholders were eagerly looking forward to the summer vacation setting in from April, given that it bumper business time for them, beside the Dasara season. But with positive cases of the coronavirus being reported in the state and citizens choosing to be better safe than sorry, there has been a massive slump in business. President of the Mysuru Hotel Owners Association, C Narayana Gowda, says, “Nearly 80% of hotel bookings have been cancelled, as tourists have been barred at hot spots. Any recovery from this slump can only be made at the end of the year, during Dasara, provided the current scenario clears up by then.” Given the situation, the Mysuru Travel Association has requested Tourism Minister CT Ravi to waive off quarterly tax and allow grace periods for repayment of loans on commercial tourist vehicles.The period from April to May was also usually good for tongawallahs in Mysuru. President of Shah Pasand Tonga Association of Mysuru, Fayaz Ahmed says, “We used to earn up to `800 in a day during the summer vacation period. But with no visitors coming into Mysuru and residents not our clientele, we have no means to eke out a living.” Yellappa Reddy, a tourist guide in North Karnataka adds, “Just before the shutdown, a steady stream of tourists was coming into Hampi from Goa. But that has come to a complete standstill. Guiding tourist is our only source of revenue. And with no one coming, we have no money even for day-to-day expenses.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74692211,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-336137/74692211.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/karnataka-tourism-tipped-to-collapse-amid-covid-19-scare/articleshow/74692211.cms

Titled Salpettai Dushara will be paired opposite Arya in the film. But bagging this film was no easy task, says the actress.“They saw a picture of mine on Twitter and called me for an audition. I had two look tests — one indoor and one outdoor. The characterisation was in typical Pa Ranjith style. I got through the film only after they liked my audition,” begins Dushara, adding, “I play the role of a north Madras girl. Ranjith writes such beautiful roles for female characters and mine is one such. I play a bold and strong character.”Dushara had to attend workshops for almost two weeks before she started shooting for the film. “The best part about Ranjith sir’s workshops is that he doesn’t act and show how to get into the role. He gave us a brief and told us to improvise on it. In fact, one of the first lessons he told us was that he won’t act as we would replicate his performance. He said he wanted originality and he got it out of us,” says Dushara.The actress began shooting for the film from January and is in the last leg of her shoot now. “In my debut, I had a small role. In my second film Anbulla Ghilli, I did a lengthy role. But this film is a big leap in my career and will be my proper debut.

Hence I request for grant of leave accordingly.”Saugata Roy’s suggestion, however, seems to have been turned down as the PM had told the BJP parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday morning that while some members have requested cutting short the session, it will continue as per schedule, which is till April 3.Senior TMC MP and leader of the House in Lok Sabha Sudip Bandopadhyay received a message from West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee to be shared with other party colleagues that asked him to avoid travelling and hence to remain in Delhi for the rest of the session.She also mentioned a list of “dos and don’ts” to prevent the virus including “no handshake,” keeping yourself hydrated, avoiding cut fruits and food from outside, social distancing, no social gatherings for the next two weeks.”Meanwhile, TMC Lok Sabha MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar , who was checked at the Parliament entry gate on Wednesday morning, was detected with slight temperature and hence detained for few seconds. However, she was allowed to go back soon after.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-outbreak-tmc-members-suspend-activities/articleshow/74700388.cms

In the wake of this, the FWICE has decided to distribute ration and materials of basic necessity to daily-wage workers who will be adversely affected by work coming to a sudden halt. The distribution will be held for a full week, starting from March 22, at Filmistan Studios (Goregaon). In order to avoid chaos or large public gatherings, the federation has devised a plan.Talking about it, Ashoke Pandit , chief advisor to the FWICE and the head of IFTDA, said, “This is an important step to help out our workers across the arts and crafts who survive on daily wages. Their bread and butter have been impacted hugely because of the temporary shutdown. So, we will be distributing basic things like rice, dals and atta to the workers who need it. To avoid a mass congregation, we will be doing the activity for an entire week, throughout the day in an organised manner. So, on a said day, we may not have workers from more than two associations coming in. We also have doctors and an ambulance on stand-by throughout the week at the venue, so if someone seems unwell, we can immediately send them to a medical facility. Among those who came forward right away to support were producers Hemant Ruprell and Ranjeet Thakur, and filmmakers Rohit Shetty, Sajid Nadiadwala , Aanand L Rai, David Dhawan. Apart from them, others from the industry like Javed Akhtar Sonam Kapoor Ahuja, Madhur Bhandarkar and Anupam Kher have also stepped forward to assist the federation in this exercise.

Lucknow girl Riya Shukla earned accolades for her performance as Swara Bhaskar ’s daughter in the film Nil Battey Sannata . Riya, who was recently in her hometown, went with us to her favourite hangout the 1090 Crossing, where apart from having her favourite tandoori chai, she also posed with a camel. “I wish I had the time to take a camel ride. This place is so cool with so many youngsters hanging out here. Also, the food that one gets here is so yummy. I love the combination of tandoori chai and Maggi. Evening mein toh yeh jagah aur bhi happening ho jati hai,” said Riya.Ask Riya, who plays a naati (dwarf) in Naati Pinky Ki Lambi Story if she was was apprehensive about playing a dwarf on screen and she says, “When I heard about the show, the first thing that crossed my mind was that this word naati. I thought ab yeh naati word mere se jud jaayega.”She adds, “After that sab yahi sochenge ki she’s a dwarf although I am not a dwarf in real life. I want to further convey to the people that this isn’t a story of a dwarf but a girl of an average height. It is the basic mentality of people in our society to judge the qualities and weaknesses of a woman. Hum yeh dekh lete hain uska rang kaisa hai, uska kad kaisa hai, uska bol-chaal ka dhang kaisa hai. So in our show also, the family hasn’t come across many drawbacks in me so they pick the height and beat around it. The show is based on the fact that the tallest man in the family has married a girl who isn’t tall enough. The actual show made on the life of a dwarf was Baba Aiso Varr Dhoondo which was telecast some years back. I am not a dwarf, nor do I play one.”Lucknow girl Riya Shukla (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)The Hichki actress adds, “I don’t consider myself short at all. Despite the fact that I’m 5 feet something, I don’t like to wear heels at all. I’m a complete tomboy and love the height God has gifted me with. Eventually, it’s about having a good heart and being confident with whatever you’re blessed with.”Riya revealed how she never really went to an acting school but believes that however one behaves in real life, is what needs to be showcased on reel. “I clearly remember when I went on reality dance show Hindustan Ke Hunarbaaz, our judge Terence had told me that you’re meant to act on television. So I’d like to believe that it sort of registered in my mind somewhere. As far as acting is concerned, I just behave how I would in real life when a similar situation would arise,” says Riya.When the actress was asked about her experience of being on the set of Nil Battey Sannata for the first time, she goes on to reveal, “Ashwini ma’am ( Iyer Tiwari , director of the film ) specially came all the way to my house in Lucknow to cast me for my role in the film. Till date I hold that moment very close to my heart. Although I was extremely nervous since I was only 14 years old at that time, the one thing that made me very happy was the fact that there were no re-takes by me.”Riya is a trained classical dancer in Lucknow gharana . She says, “My guruji passed away recently but I’ve done many shows with kathak exponent Surabhi Singh. I really wish I could take kathak forward but since I’m fully committed to my current show, Naati Pinky ki Lambi Love Story, kathak has taken a back seat.”When asked about love, Riya professed, “I want an army man, hopefully a commando, height is obviously irrelevant. The guy should be loving and caring.”With inputs from Yashi Agarwal",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74691843,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-334131,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/i-am-not-a-dwarf-nor-do-i-play-one-lucknow-girl-riya-shukla/articleshow/74692358.cms

19,['19/03/2020'],Miss Universe: It's been 20 years since Lara Dutta won the title; the actress shares her memories,"As an actress, film producer and entrepreneur, Lara Dutta has been juggling multiple hats with ease. However, the one role that’s close to her heart is that of a mentor. A former title holder ( Miss Universe 2000 ), she has been guiding the contestants of the Miss Diva pageant for the past few years. This year is quite special for Lara, as it marks the 20th anniversary of her winning the Miss Universe crown. In a conversation with BT, she remembers the day she made India proud, the evolution of contestants over the years and her take on a question that she is often asked – when will India win the next Miss Universe title? Excerpts...I can’t believe that it all happened 20 years ago, it feels like I was crowned Miss Universe just yesterday. Winning the title introduced me to some amazing opportunities in life. It’s been a lifetime of an experience.I have a very silly memory from that day. I was just 21 years old when I won the title. The event was held in Cyprus that year. It was a prime-time, live show being telecast in the US. The event rolled at 4 am in Cyprus and I was crowned at 6 am. Post the ceremony, we had a press conference where I was introduced as the Miss Universe 2000. A journalist asked me what was the first thing I wanted to do after being crowned as the new Miss Universe, and I replied, ‘I want to have breakfast’ (laughs!). Later on, I felt that I could have said something profound, but at that point, I was starving. Anyway, the press loved my honesty. I also remember my rebelliousness when I was living in the US as Miss Universe. I was expected to wear my crown and sash whenever I attended public events, but I found it bizarre. I felt that we were so much more than just the girls displaying our beauty, adorned with the sash and the crown. I wanted people to see us as strong and intelligent women. My actions had strong repercussions. So much so, from 2001, the organisers of Miss Universe started mentioning in their contract that wearing sashes and crowns at public events was a must. After long, when I wore that crown again at the grand finale of Miss Diva this year, it filled me with a sense of contentment of having done something for our country.Honestly, that’s the sad part of today. Even before they have achieved anything, they have thousands of followers. So, in their eyes, they are already stars. I am glad that we never had to deal with social media. Every photograph that these girls put up on social media has multiple filters. So much so, they look nothing like the person who finally shows up as a contestant. There’s nothing refreshing or natural about them. Where do you find that breath of fresh air? It is all about deconstructing your ego, so that you come to terms with who you are, really. I think social media puts tremendous pressure on today’s girls to gather followers and prove their popularity. It doesn’t give them an opportunity to develop real, natural confidence. Now, their confidence is based on how many likes they have received for their post. There is no concept of self-worth anymore. Over the last seven years as a mentor to these girls, my job has been to make the contestants identify their self-worth. I help them gain a sense of self-identity.They enjoy far more exposure than what we had. When we entered this world, only a few were from the modeling background. So, it all started from scratch for most of us. Our training happened behind closed doors. Today, even the training programme is televised at times. How will you learn if you are constantly performing for the camera? We were given time to hone our skills before facing the spotlight. Today, the training period is very short and almost everything is on camera. When the finalists were selected, the first thing I asked them to do was read. Whatever is the medium, one should just read. You need to cultivate love for books, it doesn’t come to everyone naturally. No amount of money can buy you the kind of intellect or information that you are armed with. I encourage a lot of young women to read. I tell them that it will change their lives.No, it doesn’t put pressure on me. Every year, so many girls come with aspirations and dreams of winning the crown. While some succeed, others don’t. However, every single contestant returns home as a more evolved, self-aware person. Now, that is victory for me. It is very easy to sit at home and wonder why our girls aren’t winning the titles.I am focusing on my production venture, which is in collaboration with an international company. I will also be acting in two web shows this year. That apart, I am focusing on my skincare brand, Arias. As a woman, it is so tough to grow your business. People are ready t o hear all your creative inputs, but the minute you start talking about numbers and statistics, they look over your shoulder to see whether you have a man backing you up or not.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74692671,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-59326/74692671.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/miss-universe-its-been-20-years-since-lara-dutta-won-the-title-the-actress-shares-her-memories/articleshow/74692671.cms

Pritesh Sharma, a wedding planner who organises weddings in Rajasthan, says, ""Some couples have also shifted their weddings from Europe to destinations like Jodhpur, Udaipur and Jaisalmer.""Shubham Verma, who had planned his wedding in Bali in June, says, ""Due to the coronavirus scare, our wedding planner suggested that we move our wedding to India, and she also said that masks should be given to all the guests if the coronavirus scare is still not over. That was the moment we decided to push the wedding to a later date because we don’t want our wedding photos to have guests in masks.""Sumeet Kharbanda, who had planned to get married in Pattaya in May, says, ""My friends in different countries backed out due to coronavirus concerns and suddenly from 200 we only had 10 friends in the guest list, so we cancelled it. We’re going to have a court wedding for now. And the elaborate reception will be organised later.""Indians rarely go for wedding insurance and those who have already invested lakhs but now face the prospect of wedding postponement, are scared about monetary losses. Mehak Sagar, co-founder of a wedding planning portal, says, ""I know at least 200 wedding planners who had to cancel multiple marriage functions. After the coronavirus scare, couples are asking wedding planners to add cancellation clauses in the wedding contracts. This applies for November and December weddings, too. This way they get their deposit back if they have to cancel or postpone the wedding in case of unforeseen circumstances.""",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74694386,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-824844/74694386.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/events/coronascare-the-big-fat-indian-wedding-takes-a-hit/articleshow/74694597.cms
22,['19/03/2020'],Music video shoot at Madh Island stalled by FWICE!,"While the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) was busy fine-tuning a plan to distribute basic supplies to daily-wage workers, they received a tip-off about an on-going music video shoot in Madh Island , Mumbai. It was for music director Amit Trivedi ’s upcoming song. The FWICE members, along with their health and safety supervisor, reached the set at about 2.30 pm yesterday and brought the work to a halt, immediately.Speaking to BT, Ashok Dubey , General Secretary of FWICE, said, “The members of the federation reached the set unannounced. When they asked the unit members why they were at work despite the announcement made on Tuesday that all shoots had to be stopped immediately, they said that they were “confused.” Initially, it was decided that work would stop from March 19, but on Tuesday, a fresh decision was made and communicated to everyone.”When we spoke to Feroz (Raja) Khan, the Health and Safety Chairman of the FWICE, who was present on the set, he said, “We spoke to the unit members. Amit Trivedi was not on the set. They were following precautions. Some unit members who had reported sick on the set were sent back home with their due payments. They had medical help at hand and were also conducting thermal screenings, wearing masks and using sanitisers, but the point is, they were not supposed to be shooting in the first place. So, we made them vacate the set and sent everyone home.”While Amit could not be reached, his wife Krutee said that she was totally unaware of the incident. “We are actually at home. How will Amit be doing any music video shoots? He hardly gets any time from film work. Since it’s a music video, everyone is assuming that it is Amit Trivedi’s video. I don’t know about this... udhar Madh mein kya ho raha hai mujhe pata nahin hai,” she said.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74695453,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-53944/74695453.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/music-video-shoot-at-madh-island-stalled-by-fwice/articleshow/74695321.cms
23,['19/03/2020'],"riya shukla: I am not a dwarf, nor do I play one in Naati Pinky Ki Lambi Story: Lucknow girl Riya Shukla","Lucknow girl Riya Shukla earned accolades for her performance as Swara Bhaskar ’s daughter in the film Nil Battey Sannata . Riya, who was recently in her hometown, went with us to her favourite hangout the 1090 Crossing, where apart from having her favourite tandoori chai, she also posed with a camel. “I wish I had the time to take a camel ride. This place is so cool with so many youngsters hanging out here. Also, the food that one gets here is so yummy. I love the combination of tandoori chai and Maggi. Evening mein toh yeh jagah aur bhi happening ho jati hai,” said Riya. Ask Riya, who plays a naati (dwarf) in Naati Pinky Ki Lambi Story if she was was apprehensive about playing a dwarf on screen and she says, “When I heard about the show, the first thing that crossed my mind was that this word naati. I thought ab yeh naati word mere se jud jaayega.”She adds, “After that sab yahi sochenge ki she’s a dwarf although I am not a dwarf in real life. I want to further convey to the people that this isn’t a story of a dwarf but a girl of an average height. It is the basic mentality of people in our society to judge the qualities and weaknesses of a woman. Hum yeh dekh lete hain uska rang kaisa hai, uska kad kaisa hai, uska bol-chaal ka dhang kaisa hai. So in our show also, the family hasn’t come across many drawbacks in me so they pick the height and beat around it. The show is based on the fact that the tallest man in the family has married a girl who isn’t tall enough. The actual show made on the life of a dwarf was Baba Aiso Varr Dhoondo which was telecast some years back. I am not a dwarf, nor do I play one.”Lucknow girl Riya Shukla (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)The Hichki actress adds, “I don’t consider myself short at all. Despite the fact that I’m 5 feet something, I don’t like to wear heels at all. I’m a complete tomboy and love the height God has gifted me with. Eventually, it’s about having a good heart and being confident with whatever you’re blessed with.”Riya revealed how she never really went to an acting school but believes that however one behaves in real life, is what needs to be showcased on reel. “I clearly remember when I went on reality dance show Hindustan Ke Hunarbaaz, our judge Terence had told me that you’re meant to act on television. So I’d like to believe that it sort of registered in my mind somewhere. As far as acting is concerned, I just behave how I would in real life when a similar situation would arise,” says Riya. When the actress was asked about her experience of being on the set of Nil Battey Sannata for the first time, she goes on to reveal, “Ashwini ma’am ( Iyer Tiwari , director of the film ) specially came all the way to my house in Lucknow to cast me for my role in the film. Till date I hold that moment very close to my heart. Although I was extremely nervous since I was only 14 years old at that time, the one thing that made me very happy was the fact that there were no re-takes by me.”Riya is a trained classical dancer in Lucknow gharana . She says, “My guruji passed away recently but I’ve done many shows with kathak exponent Surabhi Singh. I really wish I could take kathak forward but since I’m fully committed to my current show, Naati Pinky ki Lambi Love Story, kathak has taken a back seat.”When asked about love, Riya professed, “I want an army man, hopefully a commando, height is obviously irrelevant. The guy should be loving and caring.”With inputs from Yashi Agarwal",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74691843,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-334131/74691843.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/i-am-not-a-dwarf-nor-do-i-play-one-lucknow-girl-riya-shukla/articleshow/74691823.cms

28,['19/03/2020'],"Coronavirus: Results in, no community spread so far","NEW DELHI: In a relief to authorities monitoring Covid-19, all the 820 randomly collected samples of persons suffering from severely acute respiratory infection have tested negative, providing scientific evidence that community transmission of the disease is yet to manifest itself.The process of collecting samples from persons who are not in the “zone of risk” of those who have travelled abroad or have been in touch with such individuals will continue. The possibility of a community spread — when the virus is detected in a patient who has neither been abroad nor has been in contact with such a person — remains, leaving no room for complacency.“All the 820 randomly collected samples have tested negative and do not indicate any community transmission. However, we will ramp up our sample numbers and continue to do surveillance to check if there is any further spread,” a senior official and scientist at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) told TOI.The results are crucial because they are part of a scientific assessment to evaluate whether the virus has spread through community transmission. “We are not exactly ruling out community transmission but the fact that these samples have tested negative is reassuring that at the moment there is no evidence to indicate community outbreak,” the official added.The government has decided to allow select private labs to test even as officials said WHO’s call for more testing was not country-specific and pointed out a close watch was being maintained on any spike in Covid-19 cases (within current testing criteria) and in general admissions of patients with serious respiratory illnesses, signs that might indicate a wider spread.While the random tests are being evaluated, health minister Harsh Vardhan held a review on Wednesday on containment and management of the novel coronavirus , directing teams be deputed to regularly inspect and monitor quarantine facilities for ensuring necessary amenities are being provided. The move came after reports of Indian nationals returning home complaining about the poor state of facilities.ICMR had earlier said that around 1,040 samples through its 52 labs (each collecting 20 random samples) of patients admitted in ICUs at various hospitals, including private, due to influenza-like illness have been collected between March 1 and 15 to assess if the virus infected those without a history of travelling abroad or having come in contact with persons who have.“Some of our labs informed us that referrals were not enough to do all the samples. Hence, some of them collected less than 20 samples. So, we could test only 820 in this batch,” the official said.As part of continued surveillance, ICMR will collect random samples of people with SARI but without any travel history on a weekly basis. A total of 121 labs will be functional soon for the purpose. Each lab, in medical colleges across the country, has a capacity to test 90 samples per day.The ICMR’s random testing to check community transmission is running parallel to the testing and tracing of symptomatic travellers and their contacts. At present, the total capacity for over 70 functioning labs along with National Institute of Virology , Pune, is 8,000 samples per day. However, these labs are doing around 500 samples every day.Health ministry officials maintained India is still in stage II with limited localised transmission and there is no need for community testing. “Unnecessary testing will create unnecessary panic. Besides, the government is taking a graded approach to optimally utilise our resources,” an official said.According to current testing protocols, only those with any symptoms (cough, fever or difficulty in breathing) and having travel history to any of Covid-19-affected countries or those who have come in contact of a confirmed positive case, qualify for testing.The government, however, has already started ramping up its preparations for the risk of community transmission and the community testing that it might require by ordering one million additional testing kits, besides extending the network of testing laboratories.There are four stages in a disease outbreak: Stage I is usually when cases are imported and not of local origin. Stage II is when there is local transmission of cases reported, which means a section of people that is testing positive is due to having come in contact with a laboratory positive person who had a travel history. There can be a single case or local clusters of positive cases in stage II.Stage III is community transmission, wherein the scientists working to contain the outbreak are not able to pinpoint the source of infection. A person tests positive without any travel history or any contact history with a laboratory positive case.The last stage-IV is when the outbreak is declared an epidemic, where it has spread to the entire country and cases return positive one after another in large numbers without any information on source of infection. India currently is at Stage II of the outbreak, which experts say can be contained locally.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74701360,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-400587,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/results-in-no-community-spread-so-far/articleshow/74701355.cms
29,['19/03/2020'],"Sensex tanks 1710 on virus, NPA fears","MUMBAI: Despite a 1,000-point rally in the Dow Jones on Tuesday night, the sensex on Wednesday crashed another 1,710 points to close at 28,870 with banking & financial stocks, along with RIL, leading the slide as fears about a coronavirus-induced global recession continued.

On the domestic front, fears about rising bad loans for banks with exposure to the telecom sector also weighed on the index, market players said. And if Wednesday’s early trades on the Wall Street are any indication -- with the Dow and S&P500 indices each down over 6% -- there could be more pain for Dalal Street on Thursday.

According to Joseph Thomas, head of research, Emkay Wealth Management , the frontline indexes were down by close to 5.5% in a market hit by the likely adverse impact of the pandemic , which came at a time when it was negotiating a critical juncture in the already existing economic sluggishness.

“Markets will continue to mirror the developments overseas till some comfort on the spread of the pandemic is received. It is too early to say when the feeling that the asset prices are lower than their intrinsic value would start coming in,” he said.

At Wednesday’s close, at about the 28,900 level, the sensex is now down almost 32% from its all-time peak of 42,274, recorded just two months back, on January 20. Indian investors have lost about 30% of their market wealth from the peak level of Rs 160 lakh crore in early January to Rs 113 lakh crore now, BSE data showed.

Interestingly, crude oil prices on NYMEX were down over 16% in mid-session Wednesday while gold prices were down more than 2%. Historically, it’s unusual for almost all the asset prices to fall so drastically. According to global analysts, Japanese yen and US government bonds are emerging to be the only safe havens for global investors.

In the domestic market, ONGC and ITC were the only two sensex stocks which closed with gains while the remaining 28 were deep in the red as across-the-board selling continued. As per the recent trend, foreign funds were net sellers again, at Rs 5,085 crore while domestic funds were net buyers, at Rs 3,636 crore, BSE data showed. Officials from the mutual fund as well as broking industries said they are witnessing new investors coming into the market.

31,['19/03/2020'],Covid-19: 8 private firms get nod to conduct performance studies,"NEW DELHI: The drug regulator has given the nod to Roche Diagnostics and seven other private companies for conducting performance evaluation studies for Covid-19 tests with Roche saying the regulator has given its approval in record time.The approvals, however, mean that the companies cannot yet commercialise or conduct the tests in open market till the regulator gives a final approval following the validation process. Roche said the Indian regulator gave approval in “record time”, while the US regulator did so a few days earlier.“With this approval, these companies can now test samples that have already been tested by National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. If their results match with that of NIV, Pune, they will cross the validation stage,” a senior official in the drug controller’s office told TOI. He added companies will have to seek further approval before they are allowed to sell these tests in the open market.“The test licence accorded to Roche Diagnostics India allows us to initiate steps to import select quantities of the cobas SARS CoV-2 diagnostic test for product performance evaluation. Following successful completion of the evaluation, a decision from the authorities will enable us to commercialise the kits in India,” Roche Diagnostics India managing director Shravan Subramanyam said. Subramanyan said the test received the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) emergency use authorisation a few days earlier and the Indian regulator has provided “the test license in record time”, enabling the company to initiate the process of bringing it to the country.“Though this is the first step towards enabling access to the cobas SARS CoV-2 diagnostic test in India, it reinforces the government’s intent to enable public-private partnership and improve patient access in a potentially serious healthcare situation,” Subramanyan said.The performance evaluation is conducted to ensure efficacy and accuracy are similar to clinical trials. It is however not called so because a typical clinical trial is conducted on real patients, whereas these samples were received from NIV, Pune.Earlier this week, the government decided to rope in private laboratories to ramp up testing network as a preparedness measure to combat any community outbreak. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has also issued guidelines for testing and notifying of positive patients by private institutions including hospitals and laboratories.Private labs have been asked to collect samples from doorstep to avoid risk of infection. Besides, appropriate biosafety and biosecurity precautions are to be ensured while collecting samples. Alternatively, a disease specific separate collection site may be created, the guidelines said.

Meanwhile, two fresh cases of Covid-19 were reported from Delhi and one each was detected from Noida and Gurgaon on Wednesday, taking the total number of cases in Delhi-NCR to 19 so far.Police say the 23-year-old was admitted to the hospital around 9 pm and was shifted to the quarantine ward at the hospital’s Super-Specialty Block (SSB) building. The incident happened around 9.15 pm when guards heard a thud and rushed to the courtyard where they found him lying in a pool of blood. It was found that he was referred to the hospital from the IGI airport after he complained of a headache while being checked at the tarmac. He had arrived in an Air India flight.Police say that the man had been staying in Sydney for the past one year and had come to India to visit his family members at the SBS Nagar in Punjab . He works at a private company. He was scheduled travel to his hometown from Delhi on Thursday morning. Police have recovered his mobile phones and some luggage that have been seized. His family members have been informed about the incident.Sources say the body could not be removed from the scene for quite some time since the doctors advised staffers to maintain a distance of over 5 metre from the body until it was scanned for the virus. His family members in Punjab are on their way to Delhi. The body was shifted to the Safdarjung mortuary late at night. Safdarjung hospital is one of the nodal centres for quarantining of suspected as well as confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Delhi.Delhi government officials said 10 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in the state till date, including two cases confirmed on Wednesday. One of them, 22-year-old from woman from North Delhi returned from London on March 14 while the other one, a 38-year-old woman from East Delhi had returned from Saudi Arabia on March 10.In Noida’s Sector-41, a 26-year-old man who had returned from Indonesia earlier this month was tested positive. A 22-year-old Gurgaon woman was tested positive by the National Cooperative Development Cooperation (NCDC), but her reports are awaited from NIV, Pune.As of now, there were four confirmed cases of coronavirus in Noida and three in Gurgaon. The Gurgaon patient is a Palam Vihar resident, who had recently returned from London. She was admitted to a quarantine centre on Tuesday, and her family members have been kept under watch after the NCDC reports arrived on Wednesday.“We have got information that there are three positive cases in the city so far. But we are yet to get a confirmation from NIV, Pune, on the third case” said Rajiv Arora, the Haryana additional chief secretary (health).Arora, who was in the city recently to oversee preparedness, directed the Gurgaon municipal corporation to form a sub-committee to integrate both private and government medical facilities to tackle the situation. He asked the chief medical officer to set up a centre where people can get masks. “These masks will be made of cotton and bandage and can be sanitised,” he added.Arora also pointed out that ICMR would decide on the private labs that would be allowed to carry out Covid-19 tests. “At present, we have two testing labs in Haryana — PGI Rohtak and Khanpur Medical College in Sonepat,” he added.He appealed to people to behave responsibly. “We are only following the guidelines of the central government. People should not overload them with misinformation,” Arora pointed out.In Noida, samples of the 26-year-old man were collected on March 8 and the reports came on Wednesday morning. He has now been admitted to Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida , while his wife has been kept in home isolation. Her samples would be tested too. Members of the Sector-41 RWA said the couple stayed as tenants in a two-storeyed building. His landlord, his wife and their three children have also been advised to get tested.Anil Khanna, the RWA president, said the patient’s landlord had told him they hadn’t come in contact with the couple in the past 15 days. “We have also sent out advisories that other people who may have come in contact with the couple should be monitored too,” Khanna said.The Gautam Budh Nagar administration has deployed 56 teams for door-to-door surveillance and gathering details of those with recent travel history. “He is a 26-year-old man who lives with his wife. He has been sent to GIMS for further treatment,” said Dr Anurag Bhargava, the chief medical officer.Dr RK Gupta, the director of GIMS, said the condition of the 26-year-old man and that of the two others tested positive in Tuesday is stable.In keeping with the guidelines, a team from the district administration and health department went around the Sector 41 locality later on Wednesday and carried out a door-to-door surveillance of all houses within a 3km radius.Apart from this sector, areas around an office in Sector 80 where a Delhi resident and his colleague have tested positive were sanitised on Wednesday.

33,['19/03/2020'],"Covid-19: ‘Ibuprofen can worsen Covid, use Paracetamol’","NEW DELHI: People showing symptoms of the novel coronavirus should refrain from taking anti-inflammatory drug Ibuprofen and use paracetamol instead. This claim by France’s health minister has received support from World Health Organization (WHO). The UN health agency’s experts on Tuesday said they were ‘looking into this to give further guidance.’“In the meantime, we recommend using paracetamol, and not Ibuprofen as a self-medication. That’s important,” said an expert. He added that if Ibuprofen had been “prescribed by a professional, then, of course, that’s up to them.”A recent study published in medical journal, The Lancet, hypothesised that an enzyme boosted by anti-inflammatory drugs such as Ibuprofen could facilitate and worsen Covid-19 infection. This was followed by a warning from French health minister Veran who advised Covid-19 suspects to refrain from using the drug, commonly prescribed and consumed over-the-counter for fever, pain and inflammation.“In case of fever, take paracetamol,” the minister wrote and stressed that patients already being treated with anti-inflammatory drugs should take advice from their doctors.Paracetamol must be taken strictly according to the recommended dose, because too much of it can damage the liver.The Covid-19 pandemic has infected around two lakh people globally and killed over 7,800. It is known to cause fever, dry cough and shortness of breath in most patients, but in some cases, involving elderly and those with co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease , among others, it can result in pneumonia and multi-organ failure leading to death.There is no cure for the disease and treatment involves symptomatic relief mostly. Recently, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) suggested that Lopinavir and Ritonavir, anti-HIV drugs, could be used in adults who are confirmed positive for Covid-19 and have complications such as: severe respiratory distress, very low blood pressure and new-onset organ dysfunction. It has fixed parameters to decide how severe the respiratory distress should be for the fixed dose combination to be used on a patient.Similar parameters have been fixed for other possible complications as well, upon which the drug can be used to save the patients.According to ICMR experts, the inclusion of the anti-HIV drugs for treating Covid-19 was based on earlier evidence about their effectiveness against SARS and MERS coronaviruses that led to outbreaks in different parts of the world in 2002-03 and 2012, respectively, as well as the docking studies conducted by National Institute of Virology , Pune.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74701610,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-255437,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-ibuprofen-can-worsen-covid-use-paracetamol/articleshow/74701605.cms

This comes days after a techie who returned from the US via London and later tested Covid-19 positive threw the home isolation rule to the wind by playing tennis on three different courts on three days and watching a movie in a theatre with his family. Karnataka recorded the first Covid-19 death in the country with a 76-year-old man from Kalburgi who returned from Saudi Arabia dying. The state has reported 14 coronavirus positive cases.One of the doctors who is now in home isolation works at Victoria Hospital , Bengaluru, whose campus houses INU. On March 15, he accompanied a 20-year-old relative, who recently returned from the UK, to the coronavirus testing centre on the campus. On March 16, he held a meeting with three doctors from INU, including the institute’s director, Dr R Keshavamurthy . Later that day, test reports revealed that the 20-year-old relative, a woman, had coronavirus.A source at Victoria claimed that before going for the test on March 15, the woman had told the doctor relative on the phone that she had some symptoms. The doctor still advised her to meet him.The directorate of the state medical education has now asked all four doctors to self-isolate for 14 days. The view in the directorate was that the doctors’ continued presence on the campus would have caused further problems for INU patients who are already immunocompromised.Speaking to TOI from his home isolation, Dr Keshavamurthy said the woman who tested positive visited the Victoria premises on March 15 to meet a faculty member, who attended the said meeting on Monday.“None of us have any symptoms, but as a precaution, we are in home isolation. The work at INU will not be hampered. I am checking all the required reports online,” Dr Keshavamurthy said, adding the woman was not related to him.The case has upset officials of the health and family welfare department, who say contact tracing of positive cases has revealed a pattern of fliers not adhering to the home isolation rule in Bengaluru. People returning from coronavirus-affected countries are required to stay home for 14 days immediately after arrival.According to health officials, the techie who returned to Bengaluru from the US via London on March 8 repeatedly ventured out of his home before he finally tested positive on March 16. During the eight-day period, the 32-year-old techie played tennis on three different courts on March 9, 10 and 11. He also watched a movie with his family in a theatre and met two friends on March 10.A senior health official said this was shocking behaviour, showing complete disregard of precautions designed specifically to prevent transmission of coronavirus. “As of now, only Patient 4, a 50-year-old who returned from the US via London on March 8, seems to have adhered to the government’s rule on home isolation. He didn’t step out, and his wife and domestic help also maintained distance. The latter have not showed any symptoms,” an official said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74701635,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-265814,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/karnataka-doctor-flouts-norms-lands-3-more-in-quarantine/articleshow/74701634.cms

C. Mehta vs Union Of India & others, dated October 24, 2018, whereby it has been directed that ""any motor vehicle conforming to emission standard Bharat Stage-IV shall be sold or registered in the entire country with effect from 01.04.2020.""The court has accepted our application, but dates have not been given for hearing, FADA Vice President Vinkesh Gulati told IANS.FADA had filed an application in the apex court earlier as well with the prayer for an extension of registering BS IV vehicles in wake of huge unsold inventory and slowing sales. That application was, however, rejected by the court on February 14.""Post our initial application, there has been a drastic change in circumstances in conducting business as usual. SARS-CoV-2 a.k.a coronavirus (COVID-19) which emerged in Wuhan in the Hubei province of China has spread rapidly across the globe and also in India,"" FADA President Ashish Harsharaj Kale said.""Following this in the past week there has been drastic drop in sales and customer walk-ins have reduced to a trickle as caution sets in due to fear of spreading of the Virus. Counter sales has fallen by 60-70 per cent across auto dealerships in these past few days,"" he added.Apart from the nearing deadline, auto dealers are also facing problem of getting BS IV registered in few states. Some State governments issued circulars directing that no applications for registration of BS IV vehicles would be accepted on or after a certain date, which are much ahead of March 31, 2020. The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) on Monday said that it has approached the Supreme Court seeking directions for ensuring sale and registration of BS-IV vehicles are allowed till the cut-off date of March 31st, 2020.According to SIAM, the cut-off dates ranges from February 29, 2020 to March 25, 2020 from state to state, though the BS VI Emission compliance is mandated from April 1, 2020.The Supreme Court has directed that no BS IV vehicle will be sold or registered from April 1, 2020.Though several companies had already stopped production of BS IV vehicles earlier and have exported large quantities of inventory, some dealerships are still sitting on unsold stock. A few dealers are also selling these vehicles to online sale portals so that BS IV vehicles could be sold later in the second hand market.A petrol vehicle once registered has a life of 15 years while diesel 10 years.",auto,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74701670,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1152647,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//auto/auto-news/bs-iv-vehicle-sales-nose-dive-fada-approaches-sc-for-relief/articleshow/74701673.cms
38,['19/03/2020'],"Indiabulls boss in UK, says can’t join ED probe due to flight bar","NEW DELHI: Indiabulls chairman Sameer Gehlaut and Kapil Wadhawan of DHFL have cited the Covid-19 outbreak to express their inability to appear before Enforcement Directorate in connection with the probe into alleged quid pro quo between them and Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapoor.

Sources said that Gehlaut has conveyed to the ED that he left for the UK before summons were served on him and would not be able to join the investigation into whether he allegedly paid Rs 685 crore as bribe to Kapoor in exchange of loans from Yes Bank until travel restrictions remained in force. Wadhawan, untraceable since March 9 when the CBI raided his premises, had also pointed to the pandemic to say that he would not appear before the anti money-laundering agency.

Subhash Chandra of Essel group , another high-profile recipient of a big loan from Yes Bank, who is also an MP, has cited his preoccupation with the ongoing budget session to say that he cannot join the investigation until Parliament adjourns on April 3.

ED sources expect Anil Ambani of ADAG to appear before them on Thursday. The ADAG chief, who was supposed to appear earlier, had sought an exemption from personal appearance, leading the ED to schedule the session with him on Thursday.

Gehlaut’s visit to the UK on March 12, when ED’s probe into Rana Kapoor’s dealings had gathered momentum, has left ED suspicious. However, ED sources said that they would wait for a few days before deciding the next course of action. They refused to confirm whether they were planning to get look-out circulars issued .

The CBI in its FIR against Rana Kapoor and Bindu Kapoor has said that Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd, a shell company promoted by Bindu Kapoor, had used the money received from Indiabulls to buy the 40, Amrita Shergill Marg property for Rs 378 crore. Both the CBI and the ED have registered a separate case on acquisition of this property and are probing alleged bribes received from Indiabulls.

While the CBI has alleged criminal conspiracy by Rana Kapoor and other corporates, including Gautam Thapar, who owned the Amrita Shergill Marg property, the ED has registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd, Rana Kapoor, Gautam Thapar and others to probe quid pro quo received by the Kapoors.

Indiabulls chairman Gehlaut was summoned to explain why his housing finance company had lent Rs 685 crore to Bindu Kapoor in her shell company which had no business activity prior to the acquisition of the property. Indiabulls had extended Rs 90 crore loan to Bliss Abode even before the shell company acquired the property located in a posh locality in Delhi’s Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone, adjacent to Khan Market and Lodhi Gardens.

39,['19/03/2020'],Madhya Pradesh News: Supreme Court refuses to have Madhya Pradesh MLAs’ parade in court,"The continuing political deadlock in MP, where the Kamal Nath government’s majority has been challenged by BJP, may finally end on Thursday.While refusing on Wednesday BJP’s offer to parade 16 rebel Congress MLAs before the Supreme Court judges to counter Congress’s charge that the legislators were coerced to quit the party and held in captivity by BJP in Bengaluru, the court said it would “proceed to dictate the judgement (in the case), once arguments get over on Thursday afternoon”.Justices D Y Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta said, “We do not want to play the role of Speaker. Since the chief minister had said he was ready to face the House, we do not want to come in the way of the legislature deciding who enjoys confidence of the House. But, our endeavour is to strike a balance by ensuring that the 16 MLAs are genuinely free to take decision as per their wishes.”As arguments and counter-arguments between BJP and Congress counsels flowed in the court, a political drama unfolded in Bengaluru where police arrested Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh , five ministers of the Kamal Nath government and several Congress MLAs when they tried to meet the MLAs of the Jyotiraditya Scindia faction at a city hotel. The Congressmen then sat on a dharna in front of the hotel before they were whisked them away. Later, Digvijaya said he would go on a hunger strike since he was not permitted to meet the rebel MLAs.Meanwhile in Bhopal, governor Lalji Tandon , in response to speaker N P Prajapati’s letter where he had urged the former to “ensure the safe return of the missing MLAs”, reminded him it was the responsibility of the executive to preserve law and order and “ensure safety of every citizen, including MLAs”. “You seem to have addressed your letter to the wrong person,” Tandon said.The resignation of 22 rebel MLAs has put the Congress government on notice, accentuated by the governor’s repeated directive for a floor test. Of the 22 MLAs, the Speaker has accepted resignations of just six who were ministers while the rest are pending.At the SC hearing, senior advocates Kapil Sibal (for Kamal Nath), A M Singhvi (for the Speaker) and Dushyant Dave (for Congress legislature party) repeatedly complained that the Governor’s directive for floor test would subvert constitutional provisions on ‘people’s mandate’ as the 16 MLAs are held captive.When Sibal and Singhvi insisted the MLAs were elected on a Congress ticket and they must be asked to meet the CM or Speaker, senior advocate Maninder Singh (for rebel MLAs) said there is no law which would make the SC direct an adult to meet someone he does not want to. The bench agreed and said, “This is not a child custody case that we will ask them to meet someone they do not want to. But we want to ensure that MLAs decide as per their free will.”Singh and senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi (for BJP leader and former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan ) offered to produce them before the judges in chamber for ascertaining if their actions are voluntary. Citing a string of SC judgements, Rohatgi said floor test is the only way to determine if a government enjoyed confidence of the House. “The only question is - whether the Governor’s directive for floor test, on a prima facie finding that the government has lost majority support, is to be honoured or not,” he said.With the court reluctant to meet the MLAs, Rohatgi and Singh said the SC could depute Karnataka High Court registrar general to meet the rebel MLAs and ascertain facts. “We are not held captive. But we don’t want to go to Bhopal and meet the CM or Speaker,” Singh said.Rohatgi caused a flutter in the court by saying “if the MLAs are taken to Bhopal without security cover of central forces, they will be poached back by Congress with the help of MP police”. Singhvi was quick to seize the gaffe and said this proved that BJP has poached the 16 MLAs.The bench was reluctant to depute the Karnataka HC registrar general or any registrar of the SC to meet MLAs to ascertain their views. “We are neither going to watch TV channel interviews of the MLAs nor going to meet them in chamber. It is not proper for judges to meet MLAs or involve court officials in this as this will lead to unnecessary criticism.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74701687,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-194507,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-refuses-to-have-mp-mlas-parade-in-court/articleshow/74701688.cms

A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and M R Shah adjourned the hearing on the plea of Omar’s sister Sara Abdullah Pilot , who had challenged his detention, as solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appears for J&K administration, was not available.

The bench, however, asked the counsel assisting Mehta to take instructions on the issue of Omar’s release as the court will adjudicate the plea on merit in case he is not being freed any time soon.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal , appearing for the petitioner, pleaded the bench to give a short date for hearing, but the bench said it won’t sit on Thursday and it was for the CJI to constitute the bench.

“Probably next week we are sitting and the matter will be taken up at that time,” the bench said.

The Abdullahs and former CM and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti were among many leaders detained on August 5 last year, the day the Centre withdrew the special status of J&K. Farooq was released earlier this month.

PATNA: RJD’s chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Wednesday denied that there was any lack of coordination among the grand alliance partners, hinting that there was no need for a coordination committee as demanded by the allies.

“They are talking about the need for a coordination committee, but there has always been coordination within the grand alliance. That’s why HAM (S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi’s son was given a grand alliance MLC ticket,” Tejashwi said, adding, HAM(S) had also been given one assembly seat in the bye-election and three parliamentary seats last year.

Manjhi, RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha and even Sharad Yadav had been stridently insisting on a coordination committee to sort out the differences within the grand alliance, which also includes Congress and VIP led by Mukesh Sahni.

Recently, the confusion among the opposition alliance partners got compounded on the eve of the filing of nomination papers for the five Rajya Sabha seats early this month. While the NDA was in a position to secure victory for its three candidates, the grand alliance could secure win only for two of its nominees.

Congress, Kushwaha and Sharad aspired to get the Rajya Sabha nomination from the grand alliance. However, RJD unilaterally fielded two nominees – Prem Chand Gupta and Amrendra Dhari Singh – for the two seats.

This blocked the other aspirants, which not only accentuated their internal differences, but has now also opened the way for their divergent paths that the smaller grand alliance partners like RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP, could easily take to, observers felt.

On Wednesday, Tejashwi, accompanied by RJD state president Jagdanand Singh, MLAs Bhola Yadav and Shakti Singh Yadav, among others, remained unmindful of the emerging fresh bout of differences among the grand alliance partners.

While Manjhi has shown that he could keep a window open to CM and JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar, Kushwaha has been trying to cement and strengthen ties with Congress high command and Sahni has been reportedly looking for a more stable nest outside the grand alliance to settle in. In between, having been denied the Rajya Sabha nomination, Sharad Yadav accused RJD of selling its ticket to a business tycoon (read A D Singh).

Suspending Yatra due to Covid-19 scare: Tejas

Leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said on Wednesday that his ‘Berojgari Hatao Yatra’ launched last month had been gaining large-scale support from the youth, but the ‘yatra’ has been postponed due to the Corona virus scare.

“In the four districts we have so far covered, we have received tremendous response from the youth,” he said, adding, his party has launched an information technology initiative to engage the state’s youths with the campaign.

Accordingly, he announced a mobile number — 9334302020 — where the youths can respond to an SMS message for registering their association with the party’s programme by furnishing their CV and other details. “Later, all this would be used to create a data base on the unemployed youths,” Tejashwi said.

He also put forward 18 questions to the CM on unemployment, jobs given by the government in the past 15 years, migration from the state among others.

“We think the state needs a domicile policy to secure jobs for the state’s youths,” Tejashwi said, adding, the issue was raised by the party’s MLA Bhola Yadav and others in the budget session of the assembly.

GAYA: The Myanmar National Airlines on Wednesday suspended its operations on the Yangon- Gaya route. The airlines took the decision in view of the global outbreak of Covid-19 virus.

According to a letter issued by an airlines official, flights will remain cancelled from March 18 to April 20. Earlier on Tuesday, Thai Air Asia suspended operation of its flights on the Bangkok-Gaya route. Confirming the suspension of flights by Thai Air Asia and Mynamar National Airlines, Gaya airport director Dilip Kumar said, “Air India too will suspended operation of its flights on Yangon-Gaya route from March 23 onwards.”

The airport director made it clear that Air India will continue its operations in the domestic sector on the Gaya-Delhi route. “Indigo flights too, in the domestic sector will continue,” said Kumar.

Earlier, the Union health ministry on March 16 and 17 issued advisories to the airport authorities. As per the advisory issued on March 16, visitors from or transiting through UAE, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait have to be put under mandatory quarantine for a period of 14 days. This is applicable also to Indians working in these countries. A sizeable number of people from Bihar and Jharkhand disembark at the Gaya airport.

The advisory further stated that travel of passengers from Afghanistan, Philippines and Malaysia stands prohibited immediately. A couple of days back, two Bodh Gaya hotels have been notified for mandatory quarantine of people, who have recently been to seven countries including China, Italy, France, Germany and Spain.

According to Gaya district magistrate Abhishek Singh, Hotel Siddharth Vihar and Hotel Lumbini have been notified for the purpose of quarantining people, who have been to high risk countries. “Quarantine protocol would be maintained at these places. Besides the quarantine hotels, a properly equipped isolation ward too was in place,” the DM said.

Screening of domestic travellers too has been made mandatory at the airport. Proper tracking of people who may have come in contact with high risk passengers was being done with the help of the passenger data available with the railways too.

On Tuesday, Thai Smile Airways landed at Gaya airport with just two passengers. The airlines left with 128 passengers and all of them were foreign tourists or pilgrims.

MADURAI: Ramanathapuram district police have warned autorickshaw drivers of stringent action after a series of complaints were received against them of causing inconveniences.

Thousands of tourists and devotees are visiting Rameswaram every day and there are more than a 1,000 auto rickshaws operating in that island. The complaints stated that very few of them are operating in Rameswaram with the required permits and the majority is registered in other parts of Ramanathapuram district but operating in the island without the required permissions.

According to the police, the auto rickshaw drivers at the Rameswaram railway station are not interested in picking up rides for local commuters and are keen on targeting tourists, who become soft targets as they are easily fleeced by the drivers. Police added that denial of rides to locals has often resulted in quarrels between locals and the auto rickshaw drivers.

Similarly, at the Rameswaram bus stand and in important pockets in the island, auto rickshaw drivers cause inconveniences to commuters waiting for buses, block their way and force them to get into auto rickshaws and fleece them. Overloading, speeding and rash and negligent driving that pose a threat to the safety of passengers are other allegations against the drivers of Rameswaram.

The police said that causing inconvenience to traffic by obstructing the ways and parking the vehicles in areas that are not earmarked as auto rickshaw stands are also allegations against the drivers, apart from not wearing uniforms and not carrying the required documents. Asking the drivers at the tourist destination to correct themselves, the police warned to impound the vehicles and handing it over to the court if they do not mend their ways.

PATNA: The bidding process for selecting a firm for construction of Patna ring road is likely to be initiated in two months as the ministry of road, transport and highways (MoRTH) has approved the alignment finalized by the state government for the same.

State road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav told TOI on Tuesday that a meeting to hold deliberations on the project was held in New Delhi in the last week. “The Centre has approved the alignment for Patna ring road and the detailed project report (DPR) for the same is getting finalized. We are expecting that the MoRTH will initiate the bidding process for the project following approval on the DPR in around two months,” he said.

The RCD minister said the project is a part of the special package for Bihar announced by PM Narendra Modi ahead of 2014 general elections. “Since the project is part of the PM package, it is being executed by the Centre. The state government was supposed to suggest the alignment, which we have done and it has been approved as well,” he said.

The minister said the Patna ring road alignment is Bihta-Naubatpur-Dumri-Beldari Chak-Kachhi Dargah- Bidupur bridge-Astipur- Dighwara-Sherpur-Bihta.

Several sections of the ring road are already part of other ongoing projects, including four-laning of Bihta-Sarmera road and the Kachchi Dargah-Bidupur bridge under construction.

The ring road will start near Bihta airbase and go to Naubatpur on NH-98. From Naubatpur, it will go to Dumri, passing through NH-83, which connects Patna to Gaya.

From Dumri, the ring road will go to Beldari Chak, from where it will connect to Kachhi Dargah-Bidupur bridge over the Ganga. From Kachchi Dargah-Bidupur bridge, the ring road will go to Sarai and then to Astipur in Saran district on SH-74.

From Astipur, the ring road will go to Naya Gaon and further to Dighwara and again cross the Ganga via proposed Dighwara-Sherpur bridge and back to Bihta.

“The 130km-long road is targeted to be constructed utilizing funds to the tune of Rs1500 crore,” Nand Kishore said.

The directive has been issued in view of the Covid-19 virus and to adhere to the social distancing advisory for containment of the virus, said Maulana Shibli Qasmi, the general secretary of Imarat-e-Shariah, on Wednesday.

Religious authorities are advising the devotees how to pray without taking the risk of virus infection. Instructions have been issued to all the imams (religious leaders) of masjids to remove the prayer mats and sanitize the floor after every prayer service, Qasmi said.

“People can also bring their own prayer mats. Disinfectant is being used in the washrooms where people do ‘wudu’ (ritual purification) before offering the prayer,” he said and added: “Besides, tissues are being provided to the faithful suffering from cold and flu. They are being separated from others as precaution against the virus.”

Maulana Anisur Rahman Qasmi, vice-president of All India Milli Council, another religious body, said devotees enter the mosques only after doing wudu, which purifies body because by cleansing its open parts.

“The advisory itself said that maintaining hygiene is the only way to combat the Covid-19. Almost in all the city masjids, the washrooms are before the main prayer halls. People first cleanse themselves and then enter the prayer hall,” he said.

Maulana Rizwan Ahmed Islahi, president of Jamat-e-Islami Hind, said if the devotees want to shorten the period of Friday prayer, they can directly offer prayer and can skip the ‘Khutbah’ (public preaching).

Meanwhile, Afzal Amanullah, chairman of RERA (Bihar), has appealed to the management and Imams of all mosques in the state to regulate the conduct of Friday prayers. “It is important that proper distance between people offering prayers be maintained and those suffering from cold and cough do not go to masjids,” he said.

Amanullah said there is a Hadees of Prophet (SAW) in which he had instructed the people during the time of heavy rain to offer prayers from home. “We should take a cue from Hadees and ensure that Friday prayers are duly regulated so that people are safe,” he said.

KHAGARIA: Two persons—Rajendra Yadav (65) alias Pagloo Yadav and his 35-year-old son Rinku Yadav were shot dead by some armed miscreants at Poorvi Thattha village under the Mansi police station area in Khagaria district on Tuesday night.

Keepng in view the tense situation, additional reinforcement was rushed to the village. Khagaria SP Meenu Kumari said raids are on to nab the criminals involved in the incident.

The spectre of gang war was looming large over the village after the killing of three people only last month.

The trouble started when a former mukhiya Brajnandan Yadav of Thattha village was reportedly shot dead by one Vinod Yadav and his accomplices on February 8 as Vinod was not happy with Brajnandan ever since the latter's daughter-in-law Bulbul Devi was elected mukhiya of Thattha panchayat.

Enraged over the killing of Brajnandan, his supporters attacked and killed Amod Yadav, elder brother of Vinod and one Satto Yadav, a close relative of Brajnandan, on the same night.

The village has virtually turned into a fortress following the killings. ""We are apprehending more killings in the days to come,” said a local resident on the condition of anonymity, adding last night’s killing was a fallout of old rivalry. A large number of families have deserted the village in the wake of war of supremacy between two rival families of the same village.

Meanwhile, altogether 32 suspects have been arrested in this connection and remanded to custody, while Vinod is reportedly at large, police said.

“I was extremely worried. I then took an online consultation on DocsApp. The doctor checked with me about my symptoms, my whereabouts and later based on my symptoms assured me that I have common flu. He prescribed me some medicines and advised precautionary measures to stay safe,” Singh said.

With the increase in the number of COVID-19 infections in India, online doctor consultation apps such as DocsApp, mfine and iCliniq are seeing a doubling in the number of consultations. Anxious users, who are avoiding the risk of hospital infection, turn to telemedicine to ensure that they are free from the pandemic attack. Globally, platforms such as Amwell and Teladoc Health are seeing a spike since the last month and now, the early trends are seen in India as well.

“So far, we have witnessed over 10000 queries from all over the country. We have also witnessed twice the number of DocsApp Gold subscriptions as individuals reach out to consult for their near & dear ones too,” said Satish Kannan, co-founder, DocsApp. The company said it noticed a 178% increase in consultations for cough and cold indicating a sense of panic among people. Bengaluru-based mfine is seeing a 20%-25% increase in the consultations for coronavirus-related queries. Prasad Kompalli, CEO and co-founder, mfine said that the company has created a customised flow to assess corona infections and in the last week up to 2,500 have used it. “During the consultation, the tool collects basic information from users by guiding them through a set of questions to ascertain their state of health, the timeline of symptoms, age, and medical history, travel details and gauges severe cases through symptom mapping. It then lets a doctor consult with the patient over audio and video, instantly enabling doctors to see more patients without being exposed to the virus themselves,” he added. Same is the case with Coimbatore-based iCliniq which is also witnessing a 20% rise in consultations from Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. “It is a black swan moment for us; this situation is helping the telemedicine industry. While we are not promoting ourselves in any way, we are trying to help customers who are in panic,” said Dhruv Suyamprakash, founder, iCliniq. To increase their reach, the telemedicine companies are either putting out advisories for their customers or partnering with communities to spread the word. DocsApp has extended its medical assistance to MyGate, Zee Digital, Seniority & will be working with more partners to spread awareness. iCliniq has put out a booklet explaining symptoms of flu and corona in detail to help allay the fears. “Summer is also a time when we see a rise in the number of flu infections,” added Suyamprakash.

Till now, teachers were assigned to the specific evaluation centre for correction of individual subjects in both ICSE and ISC. All the examiners would sit together and correct answer scripts over a scheduled period of time. “At the end of the evaluation, scores for each student were uploaded through tabs provided by the Council. The entry would immediately be registered on the CISCE server,” said Ram Mohan Mission School principal Sujoy Biswas. But this year, the assessment system will be decentralized as the examiners have now been permitted to check answer scripts at their respective residence.

“The Council has decided to review the policy of centralized evaluation keeping in mind the health and safety of all our examiners, which is of utmost priority,” said CISCE chief executive and secretary Gerry Arathoon.

“On the first day, the chief examiner or co-chief examiner or examiner coordinator of an evaluation centre will meet all the examiners for a short time to discuss the finalized marking scheme, evaluate dummy scripts, give necessary instructions and hand over the answer scripts. It is the responsibility of each examiner concerned to transport the answer scripts safely to their residence,” instructed Arathoon to the evaluators.

“If any examiner is absent, the answer scripts should be reapportioned on the first day itself and a record should be kept,” the CISCE wrote to the schools on Wednesday. The examiners will have to upload the marks on the Live Ink Character Recognition tabs at the evaluation centre as per the schedule drawn up and on the last day, each examiner will have to hand over respective marked answer scripts to the chief examiner.

Similar instructions have been issued by the Council for ISC. However, the decision of a revised evaluation procedure are for chemistry (Paper 1), fashion designing (Paper 1), history, biotechnology (Paper 1), commerce, mathematics, mass media & communication, physical education (Paper 1), computer science (Paper 1), electricity & electronics, geometrical mechanical drawing, geometrical & building drawing, sociology, biology (Paper 1), geography (Paper 1), business studies, home science (Paper 1), elective English, psychology and art (papers 1 to 5).

The judge agreed with the contentions of Revanth’s counsel, who argued that all the sections slapped against the MP were bailable and the MP is under an obligation to attend the ongoing session of Parliament.

Public prosecutor C Pratap Reddy, while saying that he has no objection to the bail, found fault with the conduct of the MP in resorting to the unauthorised use of a drone over a private building, apparently belonging to the state’s IT minister KT Rama Rao.

He also said that since bail was now granted, Revanth’s plea for declaring his judicial remand as illegal would become infructuous. The judge agreed with the view. The MP had, in fact, filed another plea urging the court to quash the FIR too. The judge sought counters from the police in four weeks.

The case against Revanth and other accused is that on March 1, they were found at Miyakhangadda. The police noticed that they were using a drone over a building allegedly belonging to the state IT minister. Using drones without permission from a competent authority is an offence..

Revanth was arrested after he went to the police station and argued with the officials over the case booked against him.

The judge directed the trial court to grant bail to the MP on his furnishing of two sureties and a personal bond for Rs 10,000. Revanth was also directed to cooperate with the investigation and was asked not to interfere in the process of investigation.

“This means that every infected person is likely to be symptomless for five days, during which s/he can spread the virus. More than half the transmission has been done by symptomless individuals,” said Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain.

Incubation period is an extremely dangerous phase so far as transmission of any virus is concerned, said Sekhar Chakraborty, former director, ICMR-NICED. “Since the viral load in the infected is very high during this period, some symptoms will show up. But if they are mild, the infected person might not even feel sick,” he said.

Others, like RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences consultant Arindam Biswas, however, differed. “Viruses proliferate to millions inside the cell. In this case, it has been riding mucus droplets to spread. But the viral load is difficult to assess during incubation or even at a later stage,” he said.

Super-spreaders, or those who transmit the virus to a large number of people, were also a threat, said Jain. “Most of them are asymptomatic. But they need to be checked to prevent rampant transmission,” said Jain.

Paediatric intensivist Prabhash Prasun Giri said that severity of symptoms for Covid-19 will differ from person to person depending on factors like age, co-morbid conditions and immunity. “A young patient with no underlying problem might have very mild to no symptom. But the symptoms in an aged person with other co-morbid conditions could be severe. The virus is also unlikely to cause much health issues to the boy who tested positive,” said Giri, PICU in-charge at Institute of Child Health

“Anyone who has had any contact with an infected person or has travelled to an affected region can become silent carrier even if they have no symptoms. All of them might not need to get their swabs tested but they need to be quarantined,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri of Peerless Hospital.

62,['19/03/2020'],Don’t panic and sell your MFs in a hurry,"MUMBAI: Long-term investors should not panic and redeem their investments in a hurry in the current market, as that would convert their notional losses into actual ones. That’s the message most financial advisers have for investors. They also point out that investors who had put their money through systematic investment plans (SIPs) over several years are better off compared to the ones who had invested lump sum amounts.According to Etica Wealth Management managing director & CEO Gajendra Kothari, investors should not panic and redeem their portfolio, fully or partially, just because the market is going down at an extremely fast clip. “If you are a long-term mutual fund investor , remember: Your money is in expert hands. Don’t redeem and convert your notional losses into real losses,” he said.It’s also important to be aware of one’s risk-taking ability and stick to the already set asset-allocation plan and not to tweak it just because a large number of good stocks are looking attractive, financial planners said. A conservative investor suddenly shouldn’t invest like one who has a higher risk appetite and vice versa, they further added.Investors should also remember that SIPs in MFs give better stability to one’s investments in the long run than putting money through the lump sum route. According to Mukund Seshadri, co-founder of the financial planning outfit MS Ventures, investing through the SIP route means “it’s taking the human behaviour relating to investing out of the whole process”. Often investors invest out of an impulse or based on tips, but SIPs ensure such factors are ignored, and hence they provide stability to the investing process.Outside of the SIP route, if one has some extra money to invest, then that should be done through a staggered route rather than putting it all in one go. “Suppose you have Rs 100 to invest. Put that in five or seven tranches,” said Kothari. “No one can catch the market’s bottom. Don’t be greedy trying to catch the market’s bottom. It’s better to space your investments over some time.”The last but vital advice is that long-term investors should not look at their returns on a regular basis, more so during times of extreme market volatility, like the current phase. Such behaviour could lead to anxiety or even panic among investors. If investments are for the long term and with some goals in mind, one should look at their returns as the timeline for achieving goals nears, financial planners said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74701354,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-94740,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dont-panic-and-sell-your-mfs-in-a-hurry/articleshow/74701348.cms
63,['19/03/2020'],Bihar: Third front possibility emerges,"PATNA: HAM(S) president and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi on Wednesday hinted at the formation of a third front in Bihar to contest the upcoming assembly election due in the state later this year.

Though his meeting with chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday fuelled speculations about fresh political alignments, Manjhi denied going back to the JD(U) fold and said he would explore the possibility of forming a “brihad mahagathbandhan” with Upendra Kushwaha’s RLSP, VIP led by Mukesh Sahani, JAP(L) led by former RJD MP Pappu Yadav, Mayawati’s BSP, AIMIM and more importantly CPI’s Kanhaiya Kumar, whom he described as a leader who works in the interest of the downtrodden in Bihar.

Manjhi’s statement assumes significance in the backdrop of his meeting with poll strategist and former JD(U) national vice-president Prashant Kishor, along with Kushwaha and Sahani in Delhi recently. Prashant is searching for a new face and also exploring options to settle political scores with Nitish, who expelled him after his frontal attack on JD(U) for its stand on CAA, NPR and NRC.

There is a strong possibility of a ‘third front’ in Bihar in the backdrop of RJD’s approach to its allies, particularly Manjhi and Congress. Party insiders say RJD does not take any notice of Manjhi’s statements citing his party’s poor performance in the Lok Sabha and assembly elections, which proved little clout Manjhi has among Dalits and Mahadalits.

Though a section of Congress is unhappy over denial of a Rajya Sabha seat, sources said the party is too weak at the grassroots level to part ways with RJD, unless it is made to “suffer a bigger humiliation” in the days ahead. “But Kanhaiya’s face can force the central leadership to think over it,” a Congress senior said.

RJD sources said the party will not contest than 150 seats in the 243-member assembly. Tejashwi took a personal dig at Manjhi on Wednesday saying it was his party, which made his son Santosh an MLC.

Though Kushwaha told TOI on Wednesday that he was with the mahagahtbandhan and will remain there to defeat NDA, RLSP sources said the party was weighing options and may go with Manjhi if it does not get a respectable number of seats.

CPI state secretary Satya Narain Singh told TOI that his party favours the formation of a “democratic secular front” with CPI-M, Pappu, Dadan Pehelwan, RLSP, VIP and Congress, provided it makes its stand clear.

“We had talks with Manjhi, Kushwaha and Pappu but things are still to take shape. We will also discuss the poll possibility at our two-day executive and council meeting to be held March 24,” Singh said, adding, Kanhaiya also wanted a non-BJP, non-RJD front in the state. However, Singh is not sure about CPI(ML) joining them for their obvious inclination towards RJD, which had left the Ara seat for the party to contest in the last Lok Sabha polls.

“There is need for a big alternative given the present political situation as democracy is in danger. CPI is welcome as it talks about Bihari interest. We will discuss the political scenario in our national executive committee meeting on Thursday,” Pappu said.

Qamrul Hoda, who opened the AIMIM account in Bihar assembly by winning the byelection from Kishanganj recently, said his party was not averse to a bigger alliance. “Our party leadership will decide as we are preparing on all 243 assembly seats. In fact, we had invited Manjhi to our Kishanganj rally to which he agreed, but backed out later. We will focus on Seemanchal, but joining any alliance will depend upon the partners’ clear stand on certain issues,” he said over phone.

64,['19/03/2020'],"Hand sanitizers back in shelves, but 3 times costlier","SURAT: For over ten days , they had flown off the shelves in stores across the city. Now, even as the handy portable sanitizers have returned to the market, they are being sold at almost three times their original price.

Hand sanitizers have become popular as they reportedly kill the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID)-19. After initial rush when they had gone out of stock, the sanitizers have returned to the stores.

Earlier, 100 ml portable gel-based hand sanitizers of leading brands were available at Rs 60 in chemist stores. Now, they have been replaced by locally manufactured sanitizers which are being sold at over Rs 180!

Local manufacturers have recently received license to manufacture this instant liquid cleansing material. But the price at which they are sold have left many surprised.

Most of these sanitizers are being sold under different brand names, a majority of which were so far unheard of.

Chemists themselves have no explanation on why such nondescript sanitizers are being sold at such high prices.

“We are just collecting the price that has been printed on the bottle. We are receiving limited supply. If we get 20 bottles in the morning, none is left in the evening,” said an employee of a chemist store at Parle Point.

As many as 20 different nondescript brands of sanitizers that are manufactured in the city and peripheral areas have hit the stores.

""Many manufacturers were issued fresh licenses to deal with the current situation and they have already started selling their products in the local market. So far, we have not received any complaint related to quality of these products,"" said an official in Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA) in the city.

""Those manufacturers who are supplying hand sanitizers to hospitals and medical professionals have not increased their price. There is minor price hike due to rise in cost of raw material. The hand sanitizers falling in cosmetic category are sold to retail buyers and they could be selling them at a higher price,” said Ravi Patel , manufacturer of hand sanitizers.

According to FDCA officials there is no price cap on hand sanitizers but there are restrictions about its hoarding or overcharging.

“There is no price cap on maximum price of hand sanitizers. Our priority is to ensure that the product is available easily in the market,"" said H G Koshia, commissioner, FDCA, Gujarat.

SURAT: An innovative mule was caught trying to smuggle in gold at the Surat international airport late on Tuesday night. Scanning revealed the passenger flying in with a suitcase, the cover of which was laced with thin foil strips of about 500 grams of the yellow metal which carried a market value of Rs20 lakh.

The customs people sniffed a rat when the passenger, identified as Ganesh Valodara, who disembarked from the Air India Express flight from Sharjah to Surat, attempted to slip away with his check-in luggage.

Sources with the Air Intelligence Unit (AIR) of Surat customs said its sleuths intercepted Valodara after finding his movements suspicious and scanned his luggage. During the scanning exercise, the bag revealed some unusual images, leading the officials to physically inspect the contents which exposed the gold foil strips hidden in the false compartment of the bag.

It was ascertained that the gold was beaten into foils, cut into small pieces and hidden in the bag.

Sources said that the accused was questioned on the source and destination of the gold foil, but he failed to give satisfactory answers. The accused revealed that he had taken the smuggling job after he was offered good amount of money by the person who had asked him to bring the illegal consignment to Surat.

It must be noted that the Union health ministry has issued orders for compulsory quarantine of the passengers arriving from UAE and other countries at the airports from March 18, this smuggler tried to get away with the smuggled gold at the Surat airport .

He said sufficient lights and cleanliness will be ensured at the bus stops.

Agarwal said the bus queue shelters were constructed at many places in the past but many of them were removed due to road widening work. “Those bus queue shelters will be installed again and maintained by Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation (BUIDCo),” he said.

The divisional commissioner also issued instructions to traffic DSP to remove encroachments from the existing bus stops by March 31. “Many bus stops have been encroached by putting carts and kiosks of fruits and fast food items. All such encroachments will be removed to ensure that buses stop at the designated stands only,” Agarwal said.

68,['19/03/2020'],"‘Open to fight a direct election, if party wants’","PATNA: When RJD announced businessman Amarendra Dhari Singh ’s name for Rajya Rabha, it had caused a stir in political circles. In an interview to TOI’s Sheezan Nezami, Singh talks about his shift from business to politics and why he opted for RJD. An excerpt:

You are a businessman. All of a sudden your name cropped up for RJD’s Rajya Sabha candidate. People want to know about you, your family background and business?

I belong to Ainkhan village near Dulhin Bazar in Patna and completed schooling at St Michael’s, followed by graduation from Delhi University. I am a businessmen but ours is a political family. My maternal aunt Pratibha Singh was four-time Rajya Sabha member. Before 1997, there were at least four MPs from my family in the Lok Sabha.

From business to politics, what made you make the switch?

I have been associated with Lalu Yadav Ji for many years and he convinced me to accept the Rajya Sabha nomination. In fact, many politicians in Bihar , including CM Nitish Kumar, know me personally.

Are you also a primary member of RJD?

Of course I am a primary member of the party and joined it long back.

Why did you choose RJD?

Tejashwi Yadav Ji has a new vision for the development of Bihar and in my interactions with him, I got the impression that this young leader should be given a chance to lead Bihar. During my frequent discussions with him, I found that he wants to take along all sections, be it any caste, class or religion ahead. That’s the reason for my joining RJD.

Why did you choose to become a Rajya Sabha member? Why not fight a direct election?

If I am alive and my party wants then I will definitely fight a Lok Sabha election, even leaving my RS term mid-way.

When it comes to Bihar politics, we cannot wish away the caste factor. You are a Bhumiar. Do you think RJD picked you to woo Bhumiars, who otherwise are said to be BJP voters?

I do not agree that RJD picked me to woo any caste. Tejashwi Yadav’s vision is development of all castes and classes. When real development takes place and people are happy, caste will get sidelined. Since development has not taken place in Bihar, people are still thinking on caste and religious lines.

Will your presence in RJD have an impact on Bhumiar vote bank?

If JD (U) and BJP are unhappy with my nomination to Rajya Sabha, this means they are apprehensive that my caste (Bhumiar) people will not vote for NDA.

Now that you are in politics, what are your priorities?

My priority will be anything to do with development. I feel very unhappy with the plight of Biharis.

Since you have business background, have you planned anything for this sector?

Let me share my experience. Ten years ago, I wanted to do some major development work in Bihar. But there was no co-operation from the CM and the bureaucracy and we lost a lot of money. The laughable part is whenever I sought appointment with the CM, I was given a date two to three months later. I cannot elaborate as the matter is sub-judice. Everyone knows big industrialists do not want to invest here. Current leadership has to welcome them with folded hands, but they want businessmen to fall at their feet.

As far as our agenda for setting up industries is concerned, initially we would focus on agriculture. Bihar produces maize, but then its processed in Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, same happens with other agro products. Sugar mills are lying defunct.

What are your future plans?

That will be as per my party’s decision.

BHUBANESWAR: To keep Covid-19 outbreak at bay, the Puri district administration on Wednesday imposed a ban on bookings in hotels in the beach town and started evacuation of tourists.

“We have issued an advisory to hotels and other tourist accommodation centres asking them not to accept any booking till further orders (for indefinite period). Hoteliers have also been asked to cancel all bookings of rooms, conferences, banquets and wedding parties with immediate effect for an indefinite period,” Puri district collector Balwant Singh told TOI.

Singh said the administration on Tuesday appealed to tourists to vacate their hotels and leave Puri within two days. “I understand that the hoteliers have already started facilitating the evacuation of tourists. Hoteliers have been strictly asked not to harass any tourist. They should politely convince the guests about the crisis situation and state government’s precautionary measures against Covid-19,” Singh said.

The Hotel Association of Puri (HAP) said only around 8,000 tourists, including around 20 foreigners, are currently present in different hotels in Puri. On a normal day in March, the presence of tourists in Puri would be at least 30,000. “We now have only 10% or 12% occupancy in almost all hotels. Puri has over 400 small and big hotels. We have been requesting the tourists to leave Puri. In the next one or two days, all hotels will be vacant. We are facilitating purchase of train and flight tickets for those tourists, who find it difficult to return home,” HAP secretary Raj Kishore Patra said.

Tourists said they were extending support to the administration. “We had arrived in Puri 10 days back when there was no fear of corona outbreak. The Odisha government started restrictions three or four days ago. We were planning to extend our stay for one more week, but we cancelled it for our own safety,” said Chandrakant Sharma, a tourist from Bhopal.

A joint team of Puri district and police officials has been patrolling at Pipili toll gate on Bhubaneswar-Puri National Highway-316 to restrict the entry of tourists, who are coming in vehicles bearing registration numbers of other states, to Puri. Over 15,000 tourists were denied entry to Puri in the last three days, sources said.

On Monday, the district administration imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC on the beaches in Puri and Konark. Restrictions have already been imposed on movement of tourists at different destinations, including Jagannath temple, where devotees are being compulsorily asked to wear mask before entering the shrine. However, the Jagannath temple administration has withdrawn its earlier plan of securing self-declaration from devotees on their health conditions.

The construction of chariots is scheduled to start on the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya on April 26. “It will be difficult to organise the crowded festival if the situation continues to remain grim. My guests in Kolkata have already started inquiring about the fate of Rath Yatra,” Shyama Mahapatra, another servitor, said.The temple and district officials are keeping their fingers crossed. “Every year, preparations for the grand festival usually start two months in advance. With Puri in a near lockdown state, officials are uncertain about the Rath Yatra’s massive preparations. We will act according to the situation. At present, our priority is to check the possible spread of the deadly virus,” Puri district collector and the temple’s deputy chief administrator Balwant Singh said.Hoteliers said they usually receive bookings from tourists at least two months before the Rath Yatra. “By this time, we would have started receiving queries about the availability of rooms in hotels. But we have been asked by the district administration to not entertain any bookings for an indefinite period,” Debasis Kumar, owner of Hotel Victoria Club, said.Last year, the district administration had pulled out all stops in the aftermath of Cyclone Fani that devastated Puri in May and successfully conducted the Rath Yatra on July 4.",bhubaneswar,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74713192,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-178722,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/coronavirus-casts-shadow-on-rath/articleshow/74698980.cms

NAWADA/ MOTIHARI: Adhering to the recent directives of the Patna high court to prevent spread of Covid-19 virus, several civil courts across the state, including those in Nawada and East Champaran districts have decided to hear only urgent matters and restrict entry of non-essential people on their premises.

Nawada civil court judges and judicial magistrates went around the court premises on Wednesday morning and interacted with the advocates on precautionary measures to be adopted for containment of the deadly virus.

The district judge, chief judicial magistrate, accompanied by a number of judicial magistrates as well as the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) secretary-cum-ACJM, toured the court premises to take stock of the situation with the viewpoint of hygiene and social distancing.

Sources said it has been decided that only matters related to emergency cases, bail hearing, injunctions and HC bail orders would be taken up in the truncated court hours (7 to 11am). Common people, other than those involved in urgent cases, would be barred from entering the court premises. The advocates welcomed the move and lauded the preventive steps.

Similarly, East Champaran civil court has also changed its office hour from 6 am to 10 am from Wednesday and all shops on its premises have been closed.

District and sessions judge Krishna Shankar Singh Sengar called a meeting of lawyers and all judicial officers to discuss measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 virus. Henceforth only urgent matters would be put up in the court for hearing.

PATNA: Unidentified armed criminals looted more than Rs8 lakh from a Uttar Bihar Grameen Bank branch at Ghataro village under Kartaha police station in Vaishali district on Wednesday. Hardly 24 hours back, another bank was looted in neighbouring Muzaffarpur district on Tuesday.

Police said at least four criminals had reached the bank on two separate bikes and fled after looting the amount. Sadar SDPO Raghav Dayal said eyewitnesses told the police that two criminals with pistols in their hands had entered the branch. “They forced the bank employees to hand over the cash from counter. They also threatened them to open the iron chest inside for more cash,” he said.

Dayal said some people standing near the branch told the police that four criminals had reached there on two separate bikes. “One of them remained seated while another stood guard at the main entrance while the remaining two looted the cash,” he said.

The SDPO said neither they fired nor damaged the digital video recorder of the CCTV cameras installed inside the bank.

Kartaha police station SHO Santosh Kumar Pankaj said the criminals entered the branch around 2.50pm and left in 12 minutes. Pankaj said hardly few hours before the loot, Rs5 lakh was deposited by a nearby petrol pump employees in the branch.

“There were two women employees and a chowkidar inside the branch along with few women customers when the loot took place. Criminals collected cellphones of everyone present there and dumped them in a washbasin before fleeing towards Lalganj,” he said, adding their movements were captured in the CCTV cameras inside the branch.

Pankaj said one of the criminals was wearing a helmet while another had covered his face with a piece of cloth. One had his face open. “The gang might be the same which had looted Rs2.53 lakh from State Bank of India’s Lalu Chapra branch at Paru in Muzaffarpur on Tuesday,” he said.

Paro police station SHO Faisal Ahmed Ansari said six criminals on separate bikes had reached the bank around 1pm and fled after looting the money.

73,['19/03/2020'],Coronavirus in Bihar: Muzaffarpur jail inmates make khadi masks,"Representative image

PATNA: Amid reports of scarcity in the open market, the inmates of Bihar jails have started manufacturing face masks of khadi on their premises only as a step to contain the spread of coronavirus.

With assistance and encouragement from the prisons department, the inmates, especially at Shaheed Khudiram Bose central jail at Muzaffarpur, are manufacturing more than 500 such masks a day.

When contacted, jail superintendent Rajeev Kumar Singh told TOI over phone that the masks being manufactured inside the jail were being supplied for use by others lodged in different jails in the state. “Presently, the inmates here are manufacturing double-layer masks. The average production cost is Rs6.5 only,” he said, adding even the khadi is woven by inmates themselves.

Singh said the masks produced in Muzaffarpur jail had been supplied to jails in four different districts. “Our inmates had supplied 200 masks to district jail in Sitamarhi, 500 to district jail in Begusarai, 150 to sub-divisional jail at Dalsinghsarai in Samastipur district and 500 more masks to district jail at Madhubani in the last few days,” he said.

In reply to a query, he also said as there is a garment industry functional inside the jail for the last several decades, inmates did not require any especial training to start production of masks.

“At any required time, we can start producing three-layer masks with tissue papers in between for more effectiveness,” he said.

Meanwhile, IG (prisons and correctional services) Mithilesh Mishra told TOI that the superintendent himself had come up with the idea. “At present, such production has started in jails at Gopalganj, Purnia and Gaya also. There are several other jails, including at Muzaffarpur, which produce phenyl and soaps. All these items are being supplied internally to maintain hygiene among prisoners and on jail premises,” Mishra said.

He said the present capacity of all jails in Bihar are around 43,000 inmates against which 40,000 inmates were lodged at present. “Orders had already been issued to maintain hygiene and procure necessary items wherever required. Most of the requirements are fulfilled from inmates,” he said.

Mishra said even before the present scenario, orders were issued for rationalizing overcrowding of inmates. “Few jails have inmates more than their capacity. They are being shifted regularly under the process,” the IG added.

74,['19/03/2020'],Mahatma Gandhi Setu work: Union ministry denies allegations of irregularities,"PATNA: An independent agency appointed by the Union ministry of road, transport and highways for monitoring the Mahatma Gandhi Setu rehabilitation project, has rebutted the allegations made by Congress MLC Prem Chand Mishra regarding irregularities in the project.

In a statement issued on Wednesday, R K Mishra, the team leader of the monitoring agency, gave point-by-point clarifications for the allegations made by the Congress MLC.

On the allegation of inferior quality of steel being used in the project, Mishra stated that the usage of high performance (HPS) weathering steel for fabrication of super structures was initially suggested to the contractor- M/S Afcons – Sibmost (joint venture).

“Initially the contractor took up steel fabrication work with HPS 70W grade of steel, but it was realised that HPS grade is not widely available in the Indian market as per requirement of the project. Therefore, the contractor proposed to use steel E410 (high grade steel) with metalising…Accordingly, the proposal was examined and found suitable for this project and the same was proof-checked by IIT-Mumbai,” the statement reads.

The statement further stated that there is no change in the fatigue life of steel and hence there is no question of sub-standard quality being used in the project. “It has also been claimed that E410 grade of steel has been used in several ambitious road and rail projects, including Chenab bridge project in Jammu, rail-cum-road bridge at Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh, Gazol Dooba bridge project in Siliguri and Mumbai-Mankhurd-Ghatkoper link flyover among others.”

Earlier, the Congress leader in a presser held at the Bihar Congress’s headquarters here on Tuesday had alleged that not only sub-standard quality of steel had been used in the repair of the bridge, but also the top damaged structure was not “broken in segments, as was warranted by the rules of the agreement with the company, but at one go”, which violated the clauses of the agreement.

On allegation of change of dismantling mythology of super-structure from cutting to crushing method, R K Mishra said in his statement that the contractors had to evolve their own design and methodology for dismantling.

“The cutting of segments was indicative and not mandatory. The contractor submitted the methodology of dismantling super structure in the land span (pillar 1 to 26) by crushing method and segments in water span (pillar 27 to 46) using jaw crushers, and accordingly it was approved by the authority engineer before implementation,” the statement reads.

75,['19/03/2020'],Banks seek RBI nod for relief to borrowers hit by Covid-19,"MUMBAI: Relief to coronavirus-hit borrowers from being classified as defaulters and additional funding to help businesses tackle a shutdown are measures that lenders want the regulator to allow to help tide over the pandemic-triggered economic shock. The Indian Banks Association ( IBA ) has also created a working group to study the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.According to an IBA official, every business is impacted either by supply disruptions or evaporating demand. An impact assessment is being done by the banks, which will be submitted to RBI by the IBA. “If a borrower depending on the tourism industry has availed home loans, he may fail to meet his EMIs for the month of March, which would cause stress. Any immediate dispensation will help the small borrower,” said Union Bank managing director & CEO Rajkiran Rai.He added that while there was already a special dispensation for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), there was a restriction on the period when it was applicable and there was a requirement for being GST-registered. “This may have to be extended to other SME borrowers. In addition to dispensation, we may have to give more money to some borrowers,” he said.Large corporate accounts may not slip into default in March, but the impact would be felt in the next quarter. “The sectors that will be immediately impacted are aviation, hospitality and tourism,” said Central Bank of India managing director & CEO Pallav Mohapatra.“While everyone will be affected, right now there is a window available only for restructuring MSME loans. This is not available for retail, agriculture and corporates. As far as I know, no call for a special dispensation across all sectors has been given,” said Mahapatra. He added that the sooner a decision is taken, the better, else the damage would be done.According to a report by ICICI Securities , the real impact of the Covid-19 crisis would come from the demand side due to the cascading impact of the slowdown. This can eventually lead to suppressed prices and, thereby, slow the financial growth of most companies. Further, a cash flow crunch can impact the debt-repayment schedule.Given the drop in demand, the chorus for a rate cut has got stronger.The RBI on Wednesday announced an additional Rs 10,000-crore liquidity infusion through bond buybacks. “Covid-19 is likely to exacerbate the spectre of slower growth domestically as clampdowns are increasing both within and outside India, which would curtail consumer mobility and lead to deferral of spending,” said Confederation of Indian Industry director general Chandrajit Banerjee.He added that the RBI must act before its April policy to deliver growth-supportive measures. “We were buoyed by the bouquet of innovative measures introduced by the RBI in its last monetary policy. The need of the hour is to continue with more such innovative steps, apart from announcing a rate cut by at least 50 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point),” he said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74706881,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-81416,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-seek-rbi-nod-for-relief-to-borrowers-hit-by-covid-19/articleshow/74701318.cms

MUMBAI: Yes Bank , under the new ownership of SBI and other lenders, has said that it will open its doors for customers an hour early on Thursday to make up for the 13-day shutdown following a moratorium imposed by the RBI .

The bank will also extend working hours across branches for senior citizens from March 19 to March 27 to minimise crowd amid the coronavirus outbreak. Following the moratorium being lifted at 6pm on Wednesday, customers could access the full range of banking online services and ATMs.

“Only a third of depositors who could withdraw up to Rs 50,000 during the moratorium, withdrew their money. This gives us confidence,” said Prashant Kumar, the RBI-appointed administrator who is set to take charge as the bank’s CEO. He added that the lender had reached out to some depositors who expressed willingness to put in more deposits given the new ownership of the bank. Kumar added that its ATMs and branches were all loaded with cash.

At the ATMs TOI visited, no major queues were witnessed at 6pm. Some customers complained on social media that they were finding it difficult to access net banking. However, TOI was able to conduct transactions online. The bank said its credit card services were also activated.

SBI, which holds 46% in Yes Bank, will not sell a single share for three years, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar had said on Tuesday. This was despite its mandate to hold a minimum of 26% in the bank. This is the first time that the RBI is relaunching a failed bank after recapitalising it with new owners. Prior to this, all failed banks were amalgamated with public sector banks.

PATNA: Even after 24 hours, police are yet to get any clue as to why Deepak Mahto’s (35) family cremated his body after he was shot dead near Govindpur village under the Fatuha police station area in Patna on Tuesday.

Police have detained nearly a dozen family members including Mahto’s father for interrogation from Gulbi Ghat while they were cremating his body. However, they are continuously trying to mislead the police by frequently changing their statements. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said by the time police reached Gulbi Ghat, almost 80% of the body was burned in the process of cremation.

“We don’t know how much evidence will surface from the postmortem of the remaining body,” the SSP said.

Sharma said it is clear that Mahto was on the spot when the firing took place. “He was rushed to a private hospital where doctors declared him brought dead citing stab injury. However, family members are repeatedly telling police that he had died of a heart attack,” the SSP said adding, Family members, who are involved in destroying evidences, will be arrested once the fact comes to the fore.”

The SSP said that the role of the doctor in the incident is also under investigation as to how he gave the report of death due to stabbing and did not inform the police. Even Mahto’s brother did not appear before the police after the incident and his cellphone is also switched off.

Meanwhile, Fatuha SDPO Maneesh said at least 10 cases of murder, extortion and other crime are lodged against Mahto with the Agamkuan police station. “He had been to jail several times. We are looking if more cases are lodged against him with other police stations also,” he said adding an FIR was yet to be lodged in connection with the incident.

The SDPO said that CCTV camera footages had surfaced before police where Mahto could be seen being taken out of the car near hospital. “His family had kept that car hidden from police but we are trying to find it. We suspect there must be blood stains inside the car and some other evidences,” he said.

Police also said that Maneesh was also involved in property dealing. “We are also investigating from that angle,” he said.

Modi said the government has decided to give the relief and relaxation to comply with the advice of the Patna high court, and also in view of the current trade scenario and situation in the state. He appealed to the tax defaulters to take the benefit of the relief and relaxation that the government has announced.

As to another relief to the tax payers burdened by the tax disputes before the goods and services tax (GST) regime came into force (or with regard to the pre-GST tax disputes), Modi said the period of the one-time settlement (OTS) scheme for them has been extended up to March 25.

So far, as many as 21,000 such tax payers have applied for the resolution of their pre-GST tax disputes, Modi said, adding that the remaining such persons should also come forward to avail the OTS scheme.

Modi said as many as Rs23,055 crore worth of taxes have been netted by the commercial taxes department till March 18 against the overall tax target of Rs25,000 crore fixed for the 2019-20 financial year. He appealed to the tax payers to pay their taxes in time, so that the taxes collected could be channelized in carrying out various developmental activities in the state.

PATNA: All the five candidates for the equal number of Rajya Sabha seats from the state assembly constituency were elected unopposed on Wednesday. Three of them are from the NDA and two from the RJD.

The five Rajya seats from the state were to fall vacant in the first week of April. The filing of nomination papers had begun on March 6, with the last date for it being March 13, followed by the scrutiny of papers on March 17 and the withdrawal of names by any candidate the next day.

The NDA candidates elected were Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh and sitting MP Ram Nath Thakur from JD(U) and BJP’s Vivek Thakur, son of the outgoing Rajya Sabha member Dr C P Thakur. Similarly, RJD nominees Prem Chand Gupta and Amrendra Dhari Singh were also elected as there was no sixth candidate in the fray.

The secretary of state assembly secretariat, Bateshwar Nath Pandey, gave each of them the certificates of their election.

While the RJD nominees had filed their nomination papers on March 12, the three NDA candidates did it on March 13. Wednesday being the last date for the withdrawal of names till 3pm, all the five were declared elected unopposed at 3.30pm.

The salient feature of the biennial elections for the Rajya Sabha seats was that the candidate selection in the NDA was a seamless exercise, unlike that in the grand alliance, where there were three other claimants over and above from the RJD, like former Union minister Sharad Yadav from the Loktantrik Janata Dal, Upendra Kushwaha from the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and also one from the Congress. However, the RJD fielded its two nominees unilaterally.

SURAT: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has postponed the personal hearing of the residents and builders of the 48 high-rise residential projects for height obstructions at runway of the Surat airport on March 19.

In a communication to the residents and builders on Wednesday, the DGCA authorities stated that the personal hearing at Surat was postponed till further notice following the coronavirus outbreak.

The DGCA had earlier served notices for personal hearing to about 198 buildings in 48 projects located in the Vesu area.

The personal hearing was organised after the Gujarat high court ordered to take up the issue of the building height obstruction at the war footing.

The HC has taken up the issue of construction of 1 metre to 14.3 metres higher than the permissible limits in the inner horizontal surface limit. It has deprecated the inaction on the part of the AAI and the SMC for their inaction after issuing notices for the demolition of construction of the buildings which do not even have Building Use Permission (BUC).

Vipul Shah, a resident of one of the affected buildings told TOI, “The DGCA has postponed the hearing due to coronavirus outbreak. The next date will be announced for the hearing.”

Meanwhile, Congress MLA from Mandvi assembly constituency, Anand Chaudhary had raised the Surat airport issue in the state Assembly. Chaudhary stated that the Civil Aviation Ministry had written a letter to state government informing about the illegal buildings obstructing the height at Surat airport Runway.

Chaudhary demanded a reply from the government whether any action has been taken by the government against the illegal constructions and those responsible. However, the state government replied that the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had issued no-objection certificates (NOCs) to the buildings at the time of building plan approval and that the case is pending in the Gujarat high court.

84,['19/03/2020'],Multi-cornered fights on cards for HCBA polls,"Nagpur: About 37 lawyers have filed nomination forms for various posts in the upcoming High Court Bar Association (HCBA) polls which have now been deferred to April 17 due to coronavirus threat.

All of them are either from various groups or contesting as an independent. Wednesday was the last day for nomination while March 23 is for withdrawal.

According to HCBA members, an interesting battle is on the cards even as no big names are in the fray unlike 2017 polls. As reported by TOI earlier, there will be multi-cornered fights for all posts. Though the last date for finalizing names has been extended, many aspirants have already started campaigning.

For the top post of president, as many as five candidates are in contention. They include Atul Pande, Shridhar Purohit and Kantilal Dhote, besides Sameer Sohoni, who’s being projected by a group led by lawyer Shreerang Bhandarkar. VG Bhamburkar, who has contested many polls, albeit unsuccessfully, is trying his luck this time as well.

For secretary’s post, Amol Jaltare and Rugved Dhore have filed nominations. For two posts of vice-presidents, there is a battle between Shreeganesh Abhyankar, Sharad Bhattad, Rajesh Nayak and Pankaj Tidke. There is a straight contest for treasurer’s post between Mangesh Bute and Shriram Deoras.

According to lawyers, the candidates started campaigning since long and it was at its peak during the two-day Holi festival. Many of them were throwing lavish parties to woo the voters, particularly the younger ones. However, those were clandestinely being held either at the contestant’s home or at farmhouse, away from the city, to escape the limelight.

She also ensures that her three grandchildren gargle with turmeric-infused salt water every night before retiring to bed.Dhumatkar is not the only one. With growing concerns over the spread of Covid-19, social media is abuzz with recommendations of preventive home remedies, attributing alternative medical streams, especially ayurveda, as the source of these recommended practices.Consuming turmeric and burning camphor at home are some of the most commonsuggestions doing the rounds. Many citizens are also putting these recommendations into practice, finding them just a hassle-free addition to their routine, which they see as harmless precautionary measures to keep their body and home disinfected.Ayurveda doctors like Dr Anura Bale, principal of Gomantak Ayurved Mahavidyalaya and Research Centre at Shiroda, says that some of these suggestions do indeed have their base in ayurveda and are not just a hoax circulating on social media.Turmeric, tulsi leaves and neem leaves are known to keep infections at bay and boost immunity, she said.“A teaspoonful of turmeric can be added to warm water, along with a few drops of lime juice. This can be consumed on an empty stomach in the morning. Similarly, either curry leaves or neem leaves can be boiled in water and sipped first thing in the morning,” said Dr Bale.She said that tulsi leaves and neem leaves can be boiled together as well to make another beneficial concoction. “Also, camphor or neem leaves can be thrown over embers of burnt out coconut shells inside the house for fumigation,” she said.The ayurveda doctor said the practice of rubbing coconut oil on the nostrils before venturing out of the house, as being suggested by some posts circulating on social media, can also be beneficial in keeping impurities out of the respiratory system.Dr Bale, however, said that none of it will help keep the body from viral infections if basic sanitary practices like frequent washing of hands and general cleanliness are not maintained.“One should also ensure that the food being consumed is well-cooked. Avoid eating half-cooked or uncooked dishes for the time being, as an extra precautionary measure.

The deceased was identified as Lalu Naresh Urav (25).

Sources said the fire broke out at Wonder Polymers located in Phase III of Vapi GIDC on early morning hours of Tuesday. Four workers were present inside the unit when the incident occurred. While three workers managed to escape, as soon as the fire broke out, the ill-fated fourth worker could not get out on time as he was asleep. Four fire tenders from the Vapi GIDC were rushed to the spot for extinguishing the fire. It took more than five hours for them to douse the fire.

The factory was shut on Monday night and only four workers were deployed for night duty. One of the worker contacted him on early Tuesday morning informing about the major fire in the factory. Chintaman Rathod, investigating officer of Vapi GIDC police said, “The entire factory has been gutted. We are yet to ascertain the cause behind the fire. It was difficult for the police and the FSL team to enter into the factory premises as the structure of the factory has sustained major damages in the fire incident.”

91,['19/03/2020'],Bigbasket in talks to buy Milkbasket &amp; Dailyninja,"(Representative image)

BENGALURU: India’s fledgling morning milk delivery startups are quickly consolidating as online grocery major Bigbasket is in talks to acquire Unilever Ventures-backed Milkbasket even as the Alibaba-backed company is in advanced stages of closing the deal to acquire another player in the space, DailyNinja , said three people briefed on the matter. Both are distress and majority stock acquisitions, according to four people briefed on the matter, expected to be done at a higher valuation for Bigbasket than its previous round which valued it at $1.2 billion last year.

“The talks are in an advanced stage with Milkbasket but its enterprise value would be significantly less than $15 million,” a person aware of the goings-on said. Milkbasket has also held discussions with other players like Swiggy , Amazon India and Dunzo as well and a deal has not been finalised yet.

Gurgaon-based Milkbasket, much like other players, largely sold milk delivery as its primary service and tried to sell non-milk items to consumers to widen its margins. Milkbasket has been clocking about 40,000-50,000 deliveries per day and is seeing a spike in order size in the past few days owing to the outbreak of Covid-19. For context, BBDaily, essentials-focused delivery service from BigBasket, was clocking about 1.4 lakh orders daily in October. Largely focused on the Delhi-NCR market, Milkbasket also expanded to cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad.

The DailyNinja acquisition is almost complete with select teams of the Sequoia and Matrix Partners India-backed startup already working out of BigBasket’s premises. Once formally closed, DailyNinja will come under BBDaily and its founders will be joining the team, a person aware of the matter said. Milkbasket co-founder and CEO Anant Goel did not reply to an email sent by TOI while he declined to comment on the matter over the phone. Bigbasket co-founder and CEO Hari Menon declined to comment as well. Queries to Swiggy, Amazon India and Dunzo did not get a response at the time of filing this article.

Both deals are expected to strengthen the position of BigBasket in the grocery delivery space, which has seen competition from Walmart-owned Flipkart, Amazon, Softbank-backed Grofers and the recent entry of Reliance Industries. The transaction marks a broader consolidation in the segment, as other players like Bengaluru-basked Doodhwala shut its service in October last year while SuprDaily was acquired by Swiggy in 2018.

Milkbasket has been the most well funded standalone player in the space, with a total of $26 million raised from Blume Ventures, Kalaari Capital, Mayfield and Beenext besides Unilever Ventures.

Investors tracking the space said that the hypothesis of a standalone player in the space could not work out given the tightening funding environment and entry of large players like Swiggy, which TOI had reported last year is planning to invest $100 million in the segment. “Everyone was going after the same segment and it became tough to raise more money with bigger players, including Amazon, investing in the space. They (standalone firms) had no choice but to consolidate,” one of the people mentioned above said.

There is hardly any business. We have advised member hotels and restaurants to reduce their working hours as a measure to manage the crisis,” said G Jayapal, general secretary, Kerala hotels and restaurants association of India, which has around 3,500 members in Ernakulam district alone. But the campaign that a shutdown is imminent is not correct, KHRA said in a statement issued on Wednesday.Jayapal himself has rescheduled the working hours of his hotel at Perumbavoor. “We used to open at 6am and close at 10pm. This is now 6am to 6pm. Member hotels have been asked to limit working hours to 12 since this would help them avoid a second shift,” said Jayapal. In places where there are multiple hotels in one location, KHRA has advised them to consider opening on alternate days.“Even if the business is down, they will have to pay their employees, remit their GST and the building rent,” said Jayapal. Many are keeping the restaurants open because the employees would be rendered jobless.Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), in an advisory, asked restaurants to ensure physical distancing of a minimum of one metre between tables and encourage open air seating but KHRA said this does not seem to be practical. “Most of the small restaurants have 100 to 150 sqft area and it would not be possible to follow this. It would be better to close them,"" said Jayapal.Restaurants are also moving away from serving chicken dishes because of customer aversion due to bird flu cases reported from northern Kerala. “The government should without delay declare a stimulus package, grant time to pay GST and also announce a moratorium on payment of bank loans,” Jayapal said.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74699935,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-86660,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/restaurants-change-work-hours-as-people-keep-away/articleshow/74699936.cms

Terming the plea frivolous, Justice Brijesh Sethi noted, “There is no infirmity, illegality or irregularity in the order passed by the trial court,” adding that the move was just a delaying tactic. Singh had assailed a trial court order dismissing his plea that he was not in the capital when the crime took place on December 16, 2012.

In his plea, he had argued that since he was not in the city at the time of the crime, the trial and subsequent conviction in the matter was vitiated and must be set aside. On that ground, he also sought quashing of his death penalty.

Through advocate M L Sharma, the plea argued that Singh was arrested by Delhi Police in the early hours of December 17, 2012, from Karoli in Rajasthan and this fact was even submitted by one of the prosecution witnesses during the trial.

The trial court had, however, summarily dismissed the plea slamming Sharma over the “callous” manner in which the application was moved and said that an advocate should not resort to all kinds of “schemes and stratagems” to procure relief for his client in a case.

It further said that Sharma had not only made a false averment before the court, but also miserably failed to discharge his duties as a counsel to bring all facts for effective dispensation of justice.

On Monday, Singh had moved Supreme Court seeking restoration of his legal remedies and alleged that his earlier counsel had misled and forced him to sign the papers. The apex court, however, refused to entertain his plea.

VARANASI: As many as three suspected cases of COVID-19, including a French national, were admitted to the isolation ward of Sir Sunder Lal (SSL) Hospital of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) while one person was put in home quarantine on Wednesday.

According to BHU spokesperson Rajesh Singh , so far 18 persons, including an American national, were examined and discharged after they tested negative since March 6. Presently, there are four persons in the isolation ward whose test reports are awaited.

Meanwhile, the district administration has warned hotels and tourists to follow guidelines issued in view of coronavirus threat or face music, even as the Varanasi Municipal Corporation (VMC) dedicated all its LED screens and public address systems being operated by the Smart City Command Centre to display and air precautions against the virus.

District magistrate (DM) Kaushal Raj Sharma on Wednesday convened the meeting of the task forces formed in view of the advisory issued by the Central and the state government.

During the meeting, the DM asked hotels to provide details of all foreign tourists within a day. He also asked the officials to ensure that hotels or lodges where people from 12 worst coronavirus affected countries are staying, are not allowing them to go outside. He said that as per advisory, such tourists can’t be allowed to go outside hotels where they are staying.

“Checking tourists with thermal scanners before their entry in a hotel is a must,” he said adding, “in case of detection any coronavirus affected person at any hotel, all persons who had came in his/her contact should be quarantined for 14 days by keeping them at the places designated for it.”

Asking all hotels, lodges, restaurants, private hospitals to sanitise their campuses within 24 hours, the DM made it clear that in case any directive is overlooked by hotels, lodges or other buildings, the facilities would be sealed.

Sharma also asked to stop people from visiting ghats and initiate legal action against those who violate the orders. He also asked to lodge cases against operators of educational institutes, coaching centres, cinema halls, swimming pools, gymnasiums, multiplexes and cinema halls who overlook the order of closure till March 31. He asked the task forces to cover areas in minimum two police station areas and give their reports on prescribed formats on every three days.

The DM also asked the officials to ensure action like sealing of meat shops operating without proper sanitation.

The task forces were also directed to inspect all the medical stores to check black-marketing of masks and sanitisers. Following the directives of the DM, the VMC engaged auto-rickshaws carrying loudspeakers for awareness about precautions.

Municipal commissioner Gaurang Rathi said, “Through smart city command centre, messages on precautions are being shown or aired through LED screens and public address systems.”

There are over 200 exporting companies in these two taluks providing employment to 6,000 people. Apart from them, thousands of people are working in grassroot level of this industry, depending on these firms. According to Vivek, in January the monthly exporting of coir and jute goods from Kerala through Kochi was between Rs 120 crore-140 crore.“In February, it was Rs 102 crore and in March it may reduce to Rs 60 crore-80 crore. If the situation becomes more serious, the exporting may cease, he said.To tide over this turbulent time, FICEA has sought the intervention of the state government. They have submitted a letter to the coir minister T M Thomas Isaac in this regard. “Our first request is to include the 14-day quarantine in ESI Holidays so that we could direct sick workers to stay home and encourage them to come forward with symptoms. It will be a big relief for exporters and workers if the government bears ESI and PF share of both manufacturers and workers. Special discounts should be given for the purchases of products from coir corporation to encourage international buyers to continue buying our handmade products even during troubled times. Credit facilities shall be extended to regular buyers for an additional 2-3 months for purchases made from the coir corporation,” said the exporters.According to a coir worker Sudhakaran of Muhamma, the coir industry has been struggling for many years. “The situation is getting worse and worse day by day due to Covid-19,” he said.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74713428,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-492799,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/covid-19-cripples-states-coir-industry/articleshow/74699932.cms

“We have already written to Yes Bank to withdraw the entire Rs 545 crore fixed deposit on Thursday. While one fixed deposit amounting to Rs 389 crore will mature on March 19, 2020, the other one of Rs 156 crore will mature on March 30. But we have decided to transfer the entire amount to a nationalized bank,” temple administrator (development) Ajay Kumar Jena said on Wednesday.

The shrine administration has been drawing flak from different quarters, including servitors and opposition political parties, for depositing the temple funds in Yes Bank last year.

The temple administration’s decision comes a day after Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das appealed to all deposits not to rush into withdrawing money from Yes Bank. Das also said all deposits in Yes Bank are safe.

Temple servitors said that the money should be transferred to at least two or three nationalised banks. “We had earlier opposed the temple administration’s decision to deposit the money in Yes Bank. The temple body had chosen the bank to get more interest. The shrine administration should now float a tender and select different nationalised banks for the deposit of temple funds,” said Jogendra Dasmohapatra , a servitor.

100,['19/03/2020'],What awaits those flying in from coronavirus hotspots,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Passengers flying into Delhi from the novel coronavirus hotspots abroad but not showing any symptoms of the infection may be “hand stamped” — like Maharashtra has been doing — to ensure they do not break the mandatory home quarantine. On Wednesday, the central government notified the standard operating procedure (SOP) for travellers landing at IGIA after a ruckus at the Terminal 3 arrivals on Monday morning over quarantine procedures.

After videos of agitated passengers at Terminal 3 went viral, the SOP was issued on Wednesday, just in time for the highest level of precautions kicking in — disallowing entry into India flying direct from Europe, UK and Malaysia, among others. In addition, anyone coming or transiting from UAE, including Dubai, Qatar and seven other countries needs to be quarantined for at least 14 days.

The flow chart of the disembarkation process, to be handled by joint teams of the airport, CISF, immigration, customs, Delhi government and other agencies, shows four steps.

Health screening on disembarkation: The airlines will escort passengers via dedicated aerobridges to counters manned by the Airport Health Organisation for initial thermal screening. The symptomatic passengers will be isolated and shifted to designated hospitals.

While the aviation ministry has been asked to stagger the arrival of flights from affected areas to ensure smooth disembarkation process, it is possible that people may fly in from virus hotspots in airlines of non-hotspot countries, creating some confusion and difficulties at IGIA.

Immigration: After the screening, asymptomatic passengers will head to designated immigration counters with a copy of the self-reporting form (SRF). Immigration officials will hand over batches of 30 cleared passengers to a five-member escort team, headed by a CISF officer and comprising representatives of DIAL, the airlines and Delhi Police.

The passports of the passengers will be retained by immigration officials and given to the CISF lead officer. The SOP stresses, “Passports shall not be handed over to passengers at any cost.” The 30 passengers will then collect their luggage and clear customs.

Control room: The escort team will move to a designated room manned by Delhi government officials and a batch number will be assigned to the 30 passengers.

Triage room: The escort head will hand over the passports of the 30 passengers to the medical officer in-charge at the counter. The passengers will all be screened at the five screening counters manned by medical officers and paramedical staff deputed by Delhi government.

Those deemed to be no-risk will be given back their passports and sent into home quarantine. Such passengers need to give a declaration that they will remain in quarantine or face penal action. “The possibility of stamping passengers with ‘home quarantine stamps’ would be explored,” the SOP says. Delhi government will keep the passengers under surveillance. High-risk passengers will be asked to opt for paid hotel stay or government quarantine and taken there on transport provided by Delhi government.

This four-step streamlining is expected to reduce the chaos from Thursday. “There was a rush to fly to India before the Wednesday deadline for mandatory quarantine or ban on direct flights,” explained an official.

MADURAI: The Tamil Nadu State Commission for Women has conducted an inquiry into the suspected case of female infanticide near Usilampatti in Madurai district .

Chairman of the commission Kannegi Packianathan said that a report is being prepared and would be submitted to the government soon.

A one-month-old baby girl died under mysterious circumstances a fortnight ago in Pullaneri village. The parents of the baby and relatives hushed up the incident and buried her body next to their house. Checkanurani police had registered a murder case against V Sowmiya, 22, and S Vairamurugan, 32, the girl’s parents. His father Singathevar was also arrested. They are lodged in Madurai central prison.

Kannegi Packianathan said that she met the deceased child’s parents and grandfather and conducted an inquiry. She also spoke to the villagers, government officials and health workers.

She said that although the child’s father was a head load worker, the family was financially stable. Villagers said that Vairamurugan’s mother died six months ago. She had told him that she will be born again as his daughter. When the child was born, he celebrated it by distributing sweets to the villagers. Although it was his second daughter, he did not want his wife to undergo family planning, since he wanted to have more children, Kannegi Packianathan said.

Sowmiya said that the child had difficulty in taking milk and she had consulted a doctor. On the day, as she was feeding the baby the child got choked while suckling and died, she said.

There has not been a single incident of female infanticide in the village for the past 25 years. The villagers were aware of the government schemes and welfare measures for girl children, Kannegi Packianathan said. TNN

NEW DELHI: A short circuit in the wiring system led to the blaze in the illegal factory in north Delhi’s Anaj Mandi last year. The chargesheet filed by Crime Branch mentions that the fire that killed 43 labourers had spread from below, suffocating to death most of the occupants of the building. The four owners of the building have been named as the prime accused in the case.

Police are also probing the role of municipal officials for allowing the factory to continue operations despite being aware of the illegalities. Municipal officials had inspected the area several times, but no red flags were raised on the illegal operations. A supplementary chargesheet is being prepared in this regard.

Rehan and his brother Imran, who is absconding, have been mentioned as owners. Rehan’s manager, Furkan, and their cousin, Sohail, have also been made the prime accused. It was found that none of the owners were aware of the number of people working in the factory and had taken no precautions for their safety.

The probe revealed that a short circuit in the electrical wires on the ground floor had resulted in the fire. The victims were not able to escape since the staircase did not have lights and the stairs weren’t wide enough for everyone to rush down.

There were 13 rooms in the building. While Sohail owned three rooms, Rehan had seven. Three others were given to Imran. All of them used to produce plastic items. The labourers were hired on a monthly basis.

The building was constructed in 2007-2008, but was not maintained well. Police have cited the inquiry report by BSES, which established that several illegal connections from the main meter room had resulted in the short circuit.

The chargesheet mentioned that the sleeping arrangement of the labourers was such that they blocked the exit. As a result, when the fire broke out, the labourers sleeping near the doors fainted due to the fumes. When the others tried to escape, they found the doors stuck with the bodies of their colleagues.

Addressing the party workers and his supporters at his residence, Revanth said it was unfortunate that TPCC president did not even visit him once in the jail.

He also said he would not be bogged down by the tactics of the ruling TRS and that he would only intensify his campaign against the corruption of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and municipal minister KT Rama Rao.

Meanwhile, state party president Uttam Reddy is scheduled to meet Union home minister Amit Shah and lodge a complaint against the TRS and the police over alleged harassment being meted out to Reddy.

114,['19/03/2020'],Rajasthan: Class XII girl ends life over exam stress,"Representative image

JAIPUR: A Class XII student committed suicide in Ganganagar on Wednesday. Initial investigation revealed that it was due to the pressure of board examinations though no suicide note was found. She had previously failed in board exams and according to officials was under pressure due to which she took her own life.

The deceased has been identified Sonu Nayak. SHO Kashyap Singh said, “She committed suicide on Tuesday evening after returning home from giving History subject examination. The prima facie appears to be that she was under academic pressure though it cannot be said with certainty that this was the reason that she took her own life. Last year also she had failed in her board examination.”

Cops are yet to ascertain the reason behind the suicide and the official added, “As of now we have no clue as to the reason behind the suicide and even the deceased’s family is unable to give us any idea as to the possible reason for the same. They claim that there was no indication that Sonu was thinking along these lines.”

“We will check her mobile phone as well to find clues which led her to take such an extreme step. We will also check her call records to find the person that she spoke to last before killing herself. Hopefully once we get more details, there will be more clarity in the case. We will also question her friends and acquaintances in case they can shed some light on the matter. We are not ruling out any possibilities at this stage,” said the official.

The girl was found hanging by her family when she did not open her room door despite repeated knocking.

117,['19/03/2020'],"Coronavirus in Nagpur: Partial lockdown in city, panic button pressed","Nagpur: The city administration directed closure of all non-essential services and establishments till the month-end to contain further spread of the novel coronavirus even though no fresh cases were reported across Vidarbha on Wednesday. This is believed to be the first-ever lockdown type situation in the city.

The drastic step comes in the wake of section 144 of CrPC — prohibiting gathering/assembly of four or more people at one place — failing to make any impact on citizens who continued to ignore the advisory.

District collector Ravindra Thakare and municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe separately issued notifications for instant shut down of all hotels, bars, restaurants, wine shops, clubs, kiosks selling fast food by 5pm on Wednesday.

The move sparked rumors on social media regarding shutting down of essential services like petrol pumps where citizens queued up in large numbers till late in the night. “Petrol pumps will also remain open,” said one of the fuel station owners Vilas Salphekar.

People thronged shops and panic buying was witnessed almost across the city. According to the collector, hospitals, petrol pumps, medicine shops, vegetables sellers, groceries, milk shops and all those covered under essential supplies will remain open.

Divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar said this enforcement is restricted to Nagpur city only.

Exercising the power under section 30 (2) (v) and (xviii) Disaster Management Act, 2005, the district collector has ordered to shut all beer shoppes, wine shops, permit room bar and restaurant, all club houses, country liquor shops, restaurants and pan kiosks till March 31.

Thakare said the decision was taken in the backdrop of four positive cases of coronavirus in the city. Looking at the experience of countries fighting the virus, the collector said the virus spread exponentially. Social distancing and home quarantine are needed to stop spread of the virus, the notification issued by Thakare stated.

The municipal commissioner issued two notifications. Citing that the state government has declared coronavirus an epidemic on March 13, Mundhe has directed closure of various establishments other than essential commodities till March 31. Shops selling daily need items, milk, vegetables and chemists will remain open.

He also directed owners of banquet halls and clubs to postpone functions including marriages and family gatherings. If a function cannot be cancelled, then the number of guests will have to be restricted to 50. The civic chief also asked them to take preventive measures.

Mundhe has asked all assistant municipal commissioners and zonal officers of all zones to ensure 100% implementation of the notification.

Nagpur city police even went round market places appealing street vendors to shut their establishments for at least three days. In a violent reaction, a police sub inspector was manhandled by a pan kiosk owner near Telangkhedi Hanuman Mandir after the cop asked the owner to close his establishment. An offence in this regard was registered at Sadar police station against the pan kiosk owner.

City commissioner BK Upadhyay confirmed that police are asking street vendors to shut their establishments for at least three days. “The appeal is being made as a large number of people gather around these vendors. Sometimes the food at such places is also unhygienic, so we want citizens to be more careful. Also section 144 (CrPC) is imposed, so more than four people cannot gather at one location.

“If anyone does not comply with the order, strict action will be taken against them under relevant sections,” CP Upadhyay said.

President of Nagpur Residential Hotel Association, Tejinder Singh Renu said that closure of restaurants and bars is certainly going to harm the industry, “but there is no other way as people tend to become casual at such establishments”.

“There has been a slight drop in the number of customers, but people are still not aware that they should not visit public places. Some of the restaurants owner were recently discussing that they should close their establishments as it was not affordable due to drop in customers. So, it (the closure) is a good thing. Small gatherings and parties are also already being cancelled,” he said.

Mayor asks citizens to cooperate

Mayor Sandip Joshi said that as compared to other countries, the number of positive patients here is less. He gave the credit for this to preventive measures taken by the Central, state governments and local machinery. “Now, we have to take measures for the coming few weeks and we should also abide by the directives issued by the government,” he said.

“People’s cooperation is needed in the fight against coronavirus. Do not rush, do not spread rumours and be careful. If you do not do so, we have to make some tough decisions for the masses,” said the mayor, who chaired a meeting convened to review the situation.

It deferred by two weeks hearing on the Centre’s plea to allow telcos 20 years to pay dues but said the time period suggested by the government is unreasonable.“We will be party to fraud if we allow self-assessment of AGR dues by telecom companies,” the bench said, adding that it cannot allow reopening of the entire judgment. At the outset itself, the bench referred to AGR dues fixed by it on October 24 last year and said it will take action against managing directors of telecom companies and government officials if its judgment is tinkered with.The Centre sought the SC’s approval to grant 20 years to telecom companies to pay in instalments the Rs 1.69 lakh crore dues on account of AGR, saying the economy will be adversely impacted if service providers do not have enough time to pay dues. It said if the companies are not bailed out, it may cause major loss of direct and indirect employment and have a cascading negative impact on the other sectors.The application said foreign direct investment sentiment would also be adversely affected and there would be adverse impact on the quality of telecom services. Government sources later explained that the recent slowdown and further impact of coronavirus were a factor in its plea before the SC.“Exercise of self-assessment of AGR dues by telecom companies cannot be permitted even in the wildest dreams,” it said. The court also said telcos were trying to influence the court through the media by publishing articles in their favour on the issue.In its application, the government informed the court that telcos have so far paid over Rs 25,000 crore and Rs 1.44 lakh crore is due on them.The apex court had on October 24 allowed the Centre to recover the amount as licence fee and penalty along with interest based on the revenue-sharing model from 2004 till 2015. It had dismissed plea of the companies that AGR, on the basis of which fee is paid by them to the Centre, should include only core telecom services and revenue from other sources be excluded.It had accepted the Centre’s contention that AGR should include dividends, handset sales, rent and profit from the sale of scrap, apart from revenue from services. Initially, 15% AGR was fixed as licence fee under revenue sharing, which was reduced to 13% and then to 8% in 2013.Telecom companies, including Bharti Airtel Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices , thereafter sought review of the verdict but their plea was dismissed by the SC on January 16.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74701708,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-207795,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sc-slams-centre-and-telcos-for-not-complying-with-its-order-on-agr-payment/articleshow/74701709.cms

123,['19/03/2020'],Strangers join hands to help the elderly in times of corona crisis,"Kolkata: Hard times bring out true friends. Sometimes, these friends can even be strangers . On the day Kolkata reported its first coronavirus case, a city youth shared a post volunteering to help any elderly family member of a non-resident Kolkatan, who has not been able to return home in these trying times.

The message soon went viral and a WhatsApp group called Let’s Help was formed. By Wednesday afternoon, the group already had 70 members.

Thirty-three-year-old Debayan Datta, who works in the hotel industry, came up with this idea on Tuesday afternoon. “My mother has to live alone when I am out of the city for professional reasons. That’s the time I feel very worried for her. When I came across all these reports of people unable to return to Kolkata because of visa issues, I thought I should do my part to help their family members,” Datta said.

So, he put up the post saying: “There are a number of colleagues and friends who live abroad and whose families are in Kolkata. If any of you have elderly parents and haven’t been able to make it back home in these unnatural circumstances, please do write in and I will do my little bit in checking on them and sending them basic supplies. Let’s all pitch in and combat this virus and try and stay safe.”

That Kolkata has a heart was evident when people started sharing Datta’s post and mentioning how they, too, want to contribute. One such Good Samaritan, who joined the group was Sreeja Vishwanathan. On Wednesday morning, she delivered a bottle of sanitizer to an elderly gentleman in Park Circus. “I have elderly people at home and I understand the situation. I didn’t know this gentleman but was referred to him by the group,” Vishwanathan said.

Muscat-based Upamanyu Roy Chowdhury has reached out to Datta. “I can’t go back to Kolkata now. My parents are old. I saw his post and called him to say that in case my elderly parents face any problem, I will seek the help of this group,” said Roy Chowdhury, who has been working as a chef in Muscat for four years now.

Inspired by Datta’s concept, his friend in Hyderabad came up with a similar initiative. “Till Wednesday, we have delivered sanitizers to six families. All of them are elderly people with their children living abroad,” he said.

It will lead to fewer patients having to approach hospitals for follow-up consultation,” he added.IMA district president Dr Anil N Kutty, district secretary Dr B Venugopalan and IMA secretary Dr Shankar Mahadevan were present at the press conference.",kozhikode,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74713629,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-303470,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/ima-urges-caution-recommends-bar-closure/articleshow/74700016.cms
127,['19/03/2020'],"Coronavirus in Kolkata: Next 8-10 days critical in fight against disease, says doctors","TimesView The response to the first cases will determine how Kolkata copes with this new disease. All government- and experts-recommended precautions must be followed. A single misstep and example of irresponsible behaviour can put the entire community at risk.

KOLKATA: The first confirmed Covid-19 case in Kolkata could be followed by several more over the next 8-10 days as the city enters the critical third phase of the outbreak that has claimed three lives across the country so far, felt virologists and experts. As more and more people reach the city form the affected areas, the task of controlling transmission will turn increasingly challenging. The silver lining is that till Tuesday, the city had managed to maintain a clean slate, so, the number of affected may remain low, doctors said.According to Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain, maintaining social distance could be the key to restricting transmission of the coronavirus, which now lurks in Kolkata. “Keeping away from theatres, malls, large gatherings and any other crowd should be the first step. Secondly, take basic safety measures like covering your face while coughing, using tissue papers, sanitizers. Now that the virus has reached the city, exposure to infected people could be the most common mode of transmission. If we manage to segregate the potential carriers from the rest, chances of transmission will be minimized,” Jain said.By the end of next week, Kolkata may have 15 confirmed cases, said Fortis Hospital pulmonologist Raja Dhar. “As more people return from the affected zones and the incubation period of the virus comes to an end, more are likely to show symptoms and get diagnosed,” Dhar said.He added that while the number of cases may now rise, there an ‘explosion’ is unlikely. “While we could be heading for the worst phase, it is unlikely to be a very bad one. So far, Kolkata and the rest of the state had no positive case, which means we go into this phase with an advantage. A lockdown is already in place, which will make it easy to prevent transmission,” added Dhar.AMRI Hospital consultant Debashish Saha agreed. “The first Kolkata patient contracted the virus abroad, which means we have been able to check local transmission so far. But now we need to step up vigil and conduct tests faster and across more centres so that all suspected patients can be screened and isolated,” he said.While the lockdown should help to flatten the virus’ rising curve, the fact that the Kolkata teen — who tested positive on Tuesday — had reportedly been out in the open for two days after his arrival has raised the chances of transmission, pointed out an infectious diseases expert.The basic guidelines need to be followed more diligently now, according to RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) consultant Arindam Biswas. “Now that the virus is at our doorstep, we can’t take any more chances. We need to identify all the people who came in contact with the infected individual. All of them have now turned potential carriers and may end up spreading the virus,” said Biswas.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74702263,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-97894,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/next-8-10-days-critical-in-fight-against-disease-docs/articleshow/74701117.cms

In all, the 12,751 gram panchayats in Telangana would get Rs 3,694 crore in the ensuing fiscal, including matching grant to be given by the state government.

However, the central funds come with a rider that 10-15% should be given to mandal parishads and another 5-25% to zilla parishads.

A senior official in the panchayat raj department told TOI that even mandal and zilla parishads have to spend the funds for development works in villages, but as per their priority plans. Four committees, constituted by the government at village-level, would spend the money in tune with the yearly and five-year plans prepared by them.

Though there were complaints from sarpanches of small villages that the budget being released to them was not sufficient as a major chunk of it would go towards purchase of tractors and paying salaries to the staff, the officials said the purchase of tractors was a one-time investment and that gram panchayats would have sufficient money to spend on developmental activities once the purchase is concluded.

Mango exports to the Gulf, European countries, South Asian countries and USA have been stalled following cancellation of flights due to COVID-19 scare.Speaking to TOI, commissioner of horticulture, Chiranjiv Choudhary, said “Andhra Pradesh exported over 1,500 metric tonnes of mangoes (Banginapalli, Rasalu and a few other varieties) in 2019. We had planned to export over 3,000 metric tonnes of mangoes this year. We are estimating that AP is likely to produce around 60 lakh metric tonnes of mangoes this season. But exports depends on various factors and the coronavirus scare has not helped the industry at all. We will be able to get a clear picture of the impact of coronavirus in a couple of weeks.”Andhra Pradesh has about 3.45 lakh hectares under cultivation of mango and produces around 40 to 60 lakh tonnes of mangoes per year. Nearly 10% of the produce is exported. Experts in the industry said mango growers and traders earn at least 30% to 40% more profit through exports over selling it in the domestic market.Sanjeev D, a mango exporter from Krishna district said, “The outbreak of coronavirus has had an impact on mango exports as air services to all major countries have been stalled. We have managed to export only three tonnes of mangoes so far this year. But now uncertainty looms over further export.”A tonne of mango is sold for Rs 50,000 and Rs 70,000. But mango growers said the prices have currently dipped to Rs 40,000 per tonne.The export of mangoes from Krishan district starts from March and reaches the peak in the second week of April.

131,['19/03/2020'],Set up addl labs to test corona patients in Vid: HC,"Nagpur: Concerned over growing number of coronavirus cases in the city, Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the government to set up additional laboratories in Vidarbha to test for the disease.

The HC also expressed concern over TOI reports of suspected patients fleeing from IGGMCH isolation wards due to lack of facilities and unhygienic conditions. “They apprehended that although they’re admitted as a precautionary measure, they shouldn’t get infected by other diseases due to insufficient facilities and lack of cleanliness,” the judges said.

“If no equipment is provided to the isolated patients to interact with society, at least through internet, social alienation may occur. It may not augur well for the government machinery in its effort to control the epidemic, as patients as well as suspected patients may not volunteer to approach medical authorities for necessary check ups and treatment,” they added.

On setting up new labs, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said, “Considering the sharp rise in number of coronavirus afflictions, authorities should take measures to create additional Viral Research Diagnostics Laboratory (VRDL) at Government Medical College and Hospitals (GMCH) at Nagpur, Yavatmal, Akola and Chandrapur.”

Taking cognisance of TOI reports of Tuesday and Wednesday exposing lack of facilities like internet connectivity at the MLA Hostel, which is housing those in quarantine, and also conflict between various government functionaries, the bench called on authorities to resolve differences and improve facilities.

“The reports show that some sort of conflict appears to have arisen between various government functionaries, which must not have been there in the first place. It indicates that some attempt is being made by authorities to pass the buck on each other. The conflict appears to be between the city’s civil surgeon and the divisional commissioner’s office, that needs to be resolved,” the judges said.

The orders came while hearing a plea filed by CH Sharma and others, regarding lack of facilities in GMCHs across Vidarbha, where Anup Gilda was appointed as amicus curiae. Another PIL by businessman Subhash Zanwar through counsel Ram Heda was also clubbed with this case. Zanwar prayed for a slew of directives, including activation of disaster recovery task force for every district to respond to threats emerging due to the coronavirus.

Gilda pointed out that VRDL, which tests for Covid-19, is currently available only at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH). It not only caters to Vidarbha region but also neighbouring states like Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, due to which it’s overburdened, he said.

Before adjourning the hearing till March 23, the judges quoted a TOI report that some of the suspected patients of coronavirus, who were admitted only as precautionary measure, weren’t provided internet facilities that led to their office work getting affected.

“These patients got themselves admitted into isolation ward with a view to continue their office work from a private place, but are experiencing problems. We don’t know whether these patients are willing to bear the expenses of internet facilities if provided. But, the fact remains that if those aren’t provided, their idleness should be a matter of concern for everybody,” they said.

132,['19/03/2020'],Concrete panels of new road stick out at Loutolim,"Panaji: The missing link of the national highway passing through Verna towards Loutolim-Ponda junction along the overhead bridge had to be restored as a part of the concrete panels could not withstand the soil deposits compression and developed a bulge, necessitating urgent repairs .

A month ago, the village panchayat brought the anomaly to the notice of the public works department (PWD),which in turn directed the contractor to carry out repairs of this vulnerable section.

PWD chief engineer Uttam Parsekar said the repair work is being carried out by the contractor MVR Constructions at his own cost, with no additional burden on the exchequer.

“The concrete panels were bulging out and the contractor has been asked to repair it,” he said.

Though PWD officials said that it is only repair work, locals said that a considerable stretch of the road has to be reconstructed considering the bulge. Percolation of rainwater into the soil is believed to have exposed the construction defects.

The repairs were ordered following a joint inspection carried out based on complaints from the locals.

The work on the missing link is funded by the central government and was taken up as part of the ongoing highway expansion work.

PWD officials have said that after the ongoing repair work is completed, the road will be opened for use after a safety audit.

The four-lane missing link road NH-17B at Loutolim is to connect the NH17 at Verna, reducing the travel time for locals by almost 6km.

Due to this missing link, normal traffic and trucks coming to the industrial estate had to follow the long route from Loutolim, Rasaim and Cortalim.

On a larger scale, the new road, once complete, will connect Vasco to Ponda, via the Borim bridge.

Earlier, the road tapered off into a dead end on the cliff at the end of the Verna industrial estate.

137,['19/03/2020'],Shortage of test kits at Mayo Hospital delaying results?,"Nagpur: The viral research & diagnostic laboratory at Indira Gandhi Government Medical college (IGGMCH) Nagpur, the only facility conducting Covid-19 tests of suspects from most part of Central India experienced scarcity of test kits on Tuesday. Timely intervention by state government authorities resolved the issue on Wednesday and the lab is now functioning with optimum capacity.

The issue came to fore when the lab did not release results of 16 new suspects admitted on Tuesday as well as four samples pending since Monday. Health minister Rajesh Tope also accepted that there had been some miscommunication resulting in shortage.

Tope said that there was some issue with testing kits at the IGGMCH, which was sorted out later. “There is a need for these labs to convey their kits requirements to the Centre before 48 hours,” he said.

Presently, 51 Labs conducting Covid-19 tests in country get these kits on behalf of the ICMR through the NIV Pune. As per protocol, they must inform the NIV about requirement of test kits 48 hours in advance.

IGGMCH Dean Dr Ajay Keoliya accepted that there was shortage but also claimed that it was resolved after intervention by secretariat. “It was due to some miscommunication but the problem was solved quickly. Tests were not affected by the shortage. The number of samples has also gone down in last two days. All tests are being done in timely and meticulous manner,” said the dean.

Many suspects admitted in the government hospitals complained that they had to wait for long hours to get their results while some got their results in a short time. Many suspects had to wait for more than 30 hours in hospital isolation ward while some got results in 6 to 8 hours.

TOI talked to leading microbiologists in Nagpur about how this test is conducted and why it gets delayed in some cases.

“Diagnostic kits come in different capacities from 100 to 500. But this doesn’t mean that a kit with 100-capacity will test 100 samples,” said a senior microbiologist in Nagpur.

According to him, sometimes, one sample needs to be tested on different parameters as per the protocol. Sometimes, re-tests are done to re-confirm results. So, one kit of 100 capacity can test 20 to 30 samples at the most. Lab technicians generally wait for this number of samples to come before starting tests.

“Reagents and other components in kit are expensive. We can’t waste entire kit for one or two samples. So, we conduct these tests batch-wise. For example, if a batch of 20 samples is set as standard, we must wait for 20 samples to come. Once the batch count completes, the tests begin,” said the microbiologist. Due to this, some samples are get tested within 6 hours and others take time up to 24-30 hours.

Meanwhile state government, on Wednesday, announced that more labs will be opened in Pune, Mumbai, Dhule, Solapur, and Aurangabad to share the load of existing two labs in state. ICMR will be providing 10 lakh kits to these labs. This will ensure timely result in future.

While some analysts feel the minister has tried hard to bring changes in the higher education sector, many are of the view that the situation on the ground remains unchanged.

Among the works done by Dhan Singh Rawat in last three years include announcements of more IT institutions in the hills and model colleges across the state. The minister has also said that those posted as temporary professors in universities will be made permanent through public service commission exams. He has also initiated a Common Umbrella Act for government and private universities as well as announced libraries to be built in each block of the 13 districts in Uttarakhand. Speaking to TOI, the minister claimed that much more is in the pipeline in next two years.

“We are opening IT colleges in hills and model colleges in the state. We are also ensuring 180 days of teaching in colleges. By 2021, Uttarakhand will have 105 degree colleges of government, 12 universities and 472 private colleges."" But many educationalists say a lot more is yet to be done including enhancing the government’s focus on research, appointments of teachers in universities and colleges and upgradation of higher education so that it matches with global education standards. Ajay Saksena, principal of DAV College, Dehradun, who is also part of a body representing degree college teachers in Garhwal, says that there are 185 posts of degree college teachers in DAV, the biggest college of Dehradun, of which only 129 are filled yet and rest are lying vacant for long. He also expressed dissatisfaction at the higher education department's move of replacing the Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) with annual examination pattern. “The CBCS system helps a student to get education anywhere in the country as it follows the UGC guidelines which are same across the country. But with annual exam system, we lag behind in the pace of global education system,” he added. Ajay Singh Rawat, Nainital-based social activist who is former HOD of history department at Kumaun University, while evaluating the minister's performance said that he credited the higher education minister for trying to create job opportunities for guest faculties in the hill state, but added there has been a lot of political interference in education in Uttarakhand and the minister has failed to rectify this situation. “I feel nothing innovative has been done by the state government to improve research in the hill state. The government has also failed to introduce a single new subject in any of the colleges in three years which paves new opportunities to students who have been studying the old curriculum and subjects since decades,” he said adding that there have been many promises made by the higher education minister in the form of more colleges in the state but all of them have been confined to paper till now.

No bio-culture is used at these sites,” stated the report, which was prepared after CPCB officials went on a field visit in January to all three landfills. The Bhalswa site was then processing 2,200 tonnes per day (TPD) of legacy waste, Okhla 250 TPD and Ghazipur 600. The report was submitted this week.The screening process to segregate waste is also not being done according to the CPCB guidelines, the report pointed out. Only a 6mm screen at Ghazipur was found to be compliant; otherwise only one screen of 30mm was being used instead of at least two screens of 30mm and 4-6mm, it added. The 30mm screen lets a lot of plastic and inerts pass, which restricts utilisation of the segregated waste for beneficial purposes, including as a soil enricher, CPCB said.It was also highlighted that barring refuse-derived fuel (RDF), the remaining screened waste was simply being dumped at the site. “It is a major issue at all sites, specifically at Ghazipur where it is precariously stored on the berm.”Another violation is non-maintenance of records for screened materials and leachate. According to CPCB, no corporation has a time-bound action plan, which may delay the process of flattening the landfills.The commissioner of North Delhi Municipal Corporation Varsha Joshi said inert materials from Bhalswa were now being used to fill up low-lying areas and at the NTPC eco park after getting a soil-test report from Sriram Institute. “Over 30,000MT has already been lifted. The processes will speed up soon,” she said. East Delhi Municipal Corporation has also said inert materials from Ghazipur are being used in filling-up activities. South Delhi Municipal Corporation couldn’t be reached despite several attempts.Civic officials have repeatedly claimed that they have no alternate site to dump the inert materials as a plea to do so in Asola has been turned down.The work started last October after NGT took cognisance of a TOI report, ‘Below Mountains of Trash Lie Poison Lakes’. CPCB submitted the report in compliance with an NGT order dated November 19, 2019, which followed another TOI report highlighting how leachate from the landfills had contaminated the groundwater and was also seeping into the Yamuna.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74702085,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-36119,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cpcb-reports-lapses-in-flattening-of-landfills/articleshow/74701140.cms

The duo who had gone to Malaysia on March 12 to pursue a one-month surgery elective were stranded after flights from Malaysia to India were cancelled, following a decision by the ministry of civil aviation to suspend flights in wake of growing concerns over the spread of Covid-19 Despite minister for external affairs S Jaishankar reaching out to them following tweets for help by these students, a technicality deprived them from taking a flight home on Wednesday. Air Asia operated two flights from Kuala Lumpur to Vishakhapatnam and New Delhi, respectively. However, only transit stranded passengers from the Philippines, and not other Indians who had gone to Malaysia ,either on study or tourist visas, came home on these flights.Mahima in a WhatsApp call from Kuala Lumpur, said that there were a lot of vacant seats on the two AirAsia flights that left for the respective destinations. “Our plea to the Indian Embassy officials and even to AirAsia officials here went unheeded, as they went with the directive of the ministry to bring back only the transit stranded passengers,” Mahima, who spent the entire day at Kuala Lumpur airport, added.Corroborating the developments in Malaysia, Rajeev Kumar Gupta, the worried father of Mahima, said a joint secretary in MEA had requested Indian Embassy and AirAsia officials in Kuala Lumpur to accommodate these students on flights to India. “However, the embassy and airline officials went with the letter and not the spirit of the exercise, and there are more than 150 Indians stranded in Kuala Lumpur hoping to return to India at the earliest,” he said.Noting that Malaysia is in total lockdown with essential items running out fast, Gupta said he is comforted by the fact that Dr Venkataraya Prabhu, dean, KMC, is going out of his way to ensure that the two students are being looked after well by the staff of their college there.“We are hoping that the Union government operates special flights to bring back other stranded Indians, including my daughter from Kuala Lumpur to India at the earliest,” he said.",mangaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/kmc-interns-still-stuck-in-malaysia-over-technicality/articleshow/74699108.cms

According to the Centre’s guidelines, all arrivals from the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman are to be quarantined for 14 days starting March 18 (Wednesday).Since 15 people from Maharashtra who earlier arrived from Dubai have tested positive, the BMC has converted one of its newly-constructed training centres for its engineers in Powai into a quarantine facility for the anticipated arrivals, apart from the isolation facility at SevenHills hospital in Marol. The Powai facility has several conference rooms where a few hundred beds are being installed, civic officials said.Most Indians expected to land by month-end are employed as blue-collared workers in the Middle East, officials said.They would be broken up into distinct categories. Those who are healthy and have their homes in Mumbai will be allowed go home, where they will have to self-isolate for 14 days. Those from places near Mumbai such as Pune or Nashik and are in the “lowest-risk category,” officials said, can proceed home as well but cannot take public transport; they would have to take private vehicles if they want to go home and not stay in the quarantine facility. All others who are from far-off places would be kept in Powai or SevenHills Hospital for 14 days. All the arrivals would be stamped and no one would be allowed to take connecting flights to other centres in India.Those who show any coronavirus symptoms would be sent for tests and those who are deemed vulnerable, such as senior citizens, would be placed in quarantine immediately.BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said, “People coming in from the airport should be in home-quarantine for 14 days at their homes, at hotels in the vicinity of the airport or our facility at SevenHills or Powai.

Ongoing travel restrictions in place to tackle the spread of coronavirus may also prevent students from abroad returning to the varsity. Andhra University has nearly 500 international students from about 40 countries.

The Union government has, in a series of travel advsories, asked the airlines to discontinue operations from various countries to India to avoid the spread of infection.

Speaking to TOI, Andhra University vice-chancellor Prof PVGD Prasad Reddy said “The varsity will take appropriate decision if the international students are unable to travel home for the summer vacation due to the restrictions. The vice-chancellor also explained measures put in place on the campus,” said Prof Reddy.

Dean (international affairs) Prof EN Dhanamjaya Rao said the majority of the varsity’s foreign students are from Africa and SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) countries and Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine.

“All the international students of the varsity have medical insurance. We are taking the best care of the students and regularly monitoring the situation,” said Prof Dhanamjaya Rao.

About 100 to 150 international students take admission every year to pursue master’s degree, engineering and research and other programmes at Andhra University. The varsity releases a separate notification every year for international students. While the university has three international student hostels for boys, it runs a separate hostel for female students in MVP Colony in Vizag city.

While some analysts feel the minister has tried hard to bring changes in the higher education sector, many are of the view that the situation on the ground remains unchanged.

Among the works done by Dhan Singh Rawat in last three years include announcements of more IT institutions in the hills and model colleges across the state. The minister has also said that those posted as temporary professors in universities will be made permanent through public service commission exams. He has also initiated a Common Umbrella Act for government and private universities as well as announced libraries to be built in each block of the 13 districts in Uttarakhand. Speaking to TOI, the minister claimed that much more is in the pipeline in next two years.

“We are opening IT colleges in hills and model colleges in the state. We are also ensuring 180 days of teaching in colleges. By 2021, Uttarakhand will have 105 degree colleges of government, 12 universities and 472 private colleges."" But many educationalists say a lot more is yet to be done including enhancing the government’s focus on research, appointments of teachers in universities and colleges and upgradation of higher education so that it matches with global education standards. Ajay Saksena, principal of DAV College, Dehradun, who is also part of a body representing degree college teachers in Garhwal, says that there are 185 posts of degree college teachers in DAV, the biggest college of Dehradun, of which only 129 are filled yet and rest are lying vacant for long. He also expressed dissatisfaction at the higher education department's move of replacing the Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) with annual examination pattern. “The CBCS system helps a student to get education anywhere in the country as it follows the UGC guidelines which are same across the country. But with annual exam system, we lag behind in the pace of global education system,” he added. Ajay Singh Rawat, Nainital-based social activist who is former HOD of history department at Kumaun University, while evaluating the minister's performance said that he credited the higher education minister for trying to create job opportunities for guest faculties in the hill state, but added there has been a lot of political interference in education in Uttarakhand and the minister has failed to rectify this situation. “I feel nothing innovative has been done by the state government to improve research in the hill state. The government has also failed to introduce a single new subject in any of the colleges in three years which paves new opportunities to students who have been studying the old curriculum and subjects since decades,” he said adding that there have been many promises made by the higher education minister in the form of more colleges in the state but all of them have been confined to paper till now.

155,['19/03/2020'],Delhi: Tech helps cops nab gang that went on robbing spree,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: A gang of robbers that targeted several people in the same day in Dwarka was busted after police tracked down their motorcycle using the zipnet software . The men targeted at least three women within a span of 20 minutes and robbed them of their jewellery and valuables at gunpoint. A goldsmith has also been arrested for buying the robbed jewellery from the accused.

The gang members, identified as Mohammad Mukhtiyar, Mandeep and Pankaj, were caught from Uttam Nagar. One pistol and two live cartridges of 0.32 bore and gold chains were seized from Mandeep. Police said that the men committed several robberies in a single day near malls and crowded areas. The men would then flee on the motorcycle expertly, even while being chased.

DCP (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said that the men were found to be involved in more than a dozen cases in a day.

The spree of incidents had happened on March 11, when the cops were bombarded with calls of robberies from different parts of Dwarka. In all the cases, the victims reported that the robbers were travelling on a Yamaha FZ bike.

Zipnet keeps a record of all the stolen vehicles, their location of theft and name of owner from which the place of theft was detected. It was found that the bike was stolen from Uttam Nagar.

“A team led by ACP Rajinder Singh was formed to track down the men,” said Alphonse. During the probe, the cops tracked the bike to Pankaj’s residence with CCTV footage of the area, using the number plate reading cameras.

After interrogating Pankaj, the cops also managed to nab the other two accused.

The accused told police that they had robbed many people in Dwarka using the Yamaha FZ motorcycle since October 2019. They also disclosed the name of the jeweller, Anil, who allegedly bought the gold off them. Anil was apprehended from his shop and four robbed gold chains were also seized from him.

156,['19/03/2020'],Govt mulls providing option of free or paid quarantine,"Ahmedabad: Health department officials in Gujarat on Wednesday hinted that those returning from abroad can get a choice of quarantine, the AMC-designated quarantine facilities for free, or checking into a hotel for 14 days.

According to directives of the central government, all persons returning from abroad, especially those from countries with a COVID-19 outbreak and those showing symptoms such as cough/cold, fever or respiratory illness, will be quarantined. This will also apply to those older than 60 years and having other health conditions such as asthma, blood pressure or diabetes.

“We are creating quarantine facilities in Ahmedabad in association with Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). The quarantine there will be free including meals and basic amenities. However, for those wanting to pay for better facilities, we are in talks with a few hotels to provide an entire floor for the purpose. These persons will get a discounted tariff. We are still working out the finer details,” said a senior state health department official.

AMC officials said that the two quarantine facilities in question are the new Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana housing units in Nikol and Gujarat Sports Club near Sardar Patel Stadium. AMC teams were seen shifting medical equipment and beds to both locations.

While the transition for the club house was smooth, with the identification of various zones and utilities, the 100-bed facility did not go down well with Nikol residents, who protested citing the health hazards.

“We are yet to get a satisfactory answer from the AMC on what measures they taken to ensure the safety of residents and what type of patients will be kept here,” says Jitendra Vyas, a resident of Jivanashray Society in Nikol. The AMC will add three more such centres, including the sports complex in eastern Ahmedabad, if needed, senior AMC officials said.

158,['19/03/2020'],Psychiatrist helps MLA Hostel travellers adjust to quarantine,"Police personnel and medical staff at the MLA Hostel

Nagpur: The quarantined travellers at MLA Hostel had a psychiatrist visiting them on Wednesday, apart from the health check-ups from time to time. The objective was to judge their state of mind during the stay in quarantine, said sources.

No clinical signs of mental disturbance like depression or other problems were seen. Though they were feeling restless and wanted to go home, even the loneliness was not of the type that is seen in clinical depression, said sources. They may have more visits by the psychiatrist in coming day, said officials here.

These travellers have arrived from the seven designated countries, China, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, and Iran.

On Wednesday, 14 more persons were taken to MLA Hostel said a government press release.

Also, five persons, including a French national who works at Dassault Reliance Aviation Limited (DRAL) at Mihan-SEZ, were released. One of them — Prajeet Gupte from Amravati — who was slated for release, opted to stay at MLA Hostel for the entire 14-day isolation period.

From Thursday morning onwards, all passengers will have to stay for the entire 14-day period and those coming from Gulf countries will also be covered.

By around 4pm on Wednesday, the persons released had begun coming out. Some of them had been inside since three days, including Robert Mate, the French national. They were made to sign an undertaking that they will remain confined to home and report if symptoms develop.

Mate, who complained about the facilities not being up to standards, was seen getting closer to others than the recommended distance of one metre at MLA Hostel, including some officials. He was driven home by a chauffeur. “I have no choice as I have been assigned to take him,” said the driver, his face covered with a handkerchief.

Earlier, there were directives that persons will be kept for 24 hours and released if no symptoms are seen. However, for some, it has also taken longer as the process took time, said an official in the district administration.

The tension could be felt among relatives too, especially parents. One of them — a career consultant, whose son has come from Germany — was seen arguing with the officials. “You should have carried out orientation sessions if the period was to be increased. We were told it’s just 24 hours and now it has been 36 hours,” said the man in his fifties.

“My son has travelled with all precautions, and don’t worry we will keep him in a separate room if he is allowed to go home and be quarantined,” insisted a college teacher, whose son has come from France.

Not long afterwards, as the son of one of them came out, the mother tried to get close to him and was immediately admonished by officials, though she refused to budge.

As the city seems to virtually shut down to contain the spread of Covid-19, daily vendors are left in a lurch, with businesses being severely impacted.These vendors, who mostly comprise migrant populations from neighbouring states, say their earnings have gone down by at least 50%, forcing them to reconsider their lives in the city. They sell a variety of things along road sides – books, earrings, pens and clothes – but most of them have reported similar losses. When TOI visited major markets on Wednesday afternoon, stalls bore a deserted look.“This is a death knell for our business. Even GST and demonetisation did not impact us to this degree. If we earned Rs 100 earlier, now it’s difficult to even make Rs 10,” said Ankit Sharma, who sells men’s t-shirts by the roadside in Connaught Place. He took over the business from his father recently, after the latter had run it for over 20 years. “We may have to let go of our two workers to sustain ourselves,” Sharma added.Even so, Sharma’s family is one of the lucky ones as his father had been able to build a house with his savings.Sharma, whose father built a house after years of saving, is among the lucky ones. For other migrant vendors who pay monthly rents for their accommodations, the possibility of going hungry is more imminent than the threat of the virus. Living on the margin with daily earnings, they are left with very few choices. And most of them are rationing food money to save for their next month’s rent.“We have decided to eat as little as possible otherwise we will be forced to go back to our village, and there are no jobs there,” said Surendra, a 30-year-old, who sells mobile covers in CP. The youth is the only earning member in his family, and lives in a rented house in Paharganj.The community says that slump in business has resulted in loss of income that will be impossible to compensate. Vinod, who sells earrings outside Lajpat Central Market, said that on most days last week, he did not sell anything. “Shoppers are not stopping at stalls,” he said.Another challenge, Vinod said, was to sell at profit. “We can’t bargain at all. Right now, our only concern is to get back the money we have already invested in our product,” he said.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74701971,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-70230,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vendors-woes-multiply-by-the-day-as-losses-mount/articleshow/74701168.cms

169,['19/03/2020'],Hotels seek waiver of SGST in wake of travel ban,"JAIPUR: Leading global and national hospitality chains operating from various cities of Rajasthan have come together and written to the chief secretary seeking relief as the industry has come to a halt after travel ban following the coronavirus outbreak. Many of the properties have now told their staff to go on leave, allotted to them annually, in the absence of any operational requirement.

In the letter to CS D B Gupta, 16 hotels have sought waiver of SGST till the time the situation becomes normal. “In this crucial time, we draw attention of the state government to support tourism and hospitality industry. The state government should also try and convenience the Centre for a similar remedy,” a hotelier said referring to the letter.

Similarly, the industry has urged the government to make an arrangement with banks which will allow the deferment of bank loans. “We would like to highlight the fact that most of the hotel owners have taken loans from banks and in current situation it is difficult for us to pay interest and bank EMI. Banks should be advised by the state government to consider the situation and defer the EMI & interest,” reads the letter.

In the new excise policy, the state government has raised liquor licence fees. Recently, chief minister has announced to give 10% relief on the fees given the current situation. But the industry said, “Revised excise charges for liquor for 2020-21 should be rolled back and old charges should be implemented for the hospitality industry.”

Exemption of power bills is another demand they want the government to fulfil. “50% exemption will help us in this difficult time,” the letter stated.

The students and their parents made representations to top government offices after which they were shifted to a hotel at GIFT City near Gandhinagar.

Health department officials said the state will pay for their 24-hour quarantine and will look into the complaints raised. Several parents and relatives took the issue to Twitter, marking central and state ministers. The students were mainly returning from the UK, France and Germany.

Tejal Shah, whose daughter returned from Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi, claimed that few passengers had any idea of why they were taken to the hospital. “When we raised the issues of being bunched together in a ward, which would increase chances of infection, and the unhygienic conditions and demanded an alternative, the officials threatened us with action under the Epidemic Diseases Act,” said Shah.

After parents and relatives took the issue to the Gandhinagar power corridors, the group was shifted to the hotel near Gandhinagar. “There too we had to fight. We were first told that for twin sharing, we would have to pay Rs 4,000,” said Shah.

In videos circulated on social media, the students were seen complaining about the toilets, passengers coughing and no one paying attention to it and lack of clarity over procedure.

MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday directed transport agencies like BEST, Metro, the railways, the state transport corporation and even private buses to run their services at 50% passenger capacity in order to decongest public transport. The state government has also asked local bodies in urban areas to reschedule timings of shops in order to avoid crowds.Importantly, BMC officials, accompanied by cops, will start visiting private offices across the city from Thursday to check if they are implementing the state’s “50% staff only” directive in the wake of Covid-19 concerns.BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi on Wednesday issued a circular asking all ward officers to identify roads on which all shops and commercial activities would be kept shut on alternate days. In areas that see big crowds, shifts for stores may be decided so that all are not open at the same time. This rule would not apply to essential stores like chemists or grocery shops. Guidelines have been issued to BEST to not allow standees in buses.These steps were announced after the CM held a review meeting with stakeholders. But senior railway officials said crowds could not be reduced in this manner to 50% of capacity as those with valid tickets could not be stopped from boarding trains.AWR official said, “At the meeting with the CM, we were asked for suggestions to reduce crowding on trains. We said the number of services cannot be reduced as that will lead to overcrowding. We said there is already a drop in ridership by 25%, and if additional measures like implementing the work-from-home directive or closing non-essential shops are taken, ridership would automatically come down to 50%.” A CR official said, “Already steps like increasing rates of platform tickets and monitoring of crowds through CCTVs have been taken. No additional measures will be taken as we already have security personnel to streamline crowd movement at stations.”BEST general manager Surendrakumar Bagde said no standees will be allowed in BEST buses from Thursday. Announcements will also be made asking passengers to keep a distance from each other. “We will ensure passengers are seated and don’t brush past each other while boarding or alighting. The conductor will ensure everyone is seated,” he said. The state has said additional buses can be deployed if needed. In Panvel civic corporation limits, all shops except essential ones will be closed from Friday.Thackeray has already appealed to people to avoid non-essential travel, saying if they didn’t, the government would be forced to stop bus and railway services.According to data with the state, there has been a 27% drop in passengers on WR, a 51% drop in those using ST buses and a 40% drop in Metro users.

Vadodara: Four persons including a husband-wife duo are currently under isolation at two government hospitals in the city after they showed symptoms similar to that of coronavirus (COVID-19).

At the state-run SSG Hospital, two individuals have been admitted in the isolation ward.

Of these, one middle-aged male, a resident of Makarpura, has travel history of Spain, while another is a female who has recently returned from United States. The 49-year-old Makarpura resident was admitted late on Tuesday night.

“We have sent samples of both these patients to Ahmedabad, results are awaited,” said Dr Rajeev Daveshwar, medical superintendent of SSG Hospital.

Nagpur: Passengers of Secunderabad-Raxual Express had a lucky escape after three wheels of a trolley of coach S-9 derailed near the Butibori yard around 7.30am on Wednesday.

Sources from Central Railways (CR) told TOI that the derailment took place when the train was moving at snail’s pace and hence, was halted soon. Passengers, who were asleep, experienced a slight jerk, but fortunately, none was injured.

Senior CR officials, including divisional railway manager, Somesh Kumar, rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation.

Railway spokesperson and assistant commercial manager (ACM) SG Rao said the reason behind the derailment is unclear. “We are investigating the cause of the accident. However, the rerailment of the train was done in a record 26 minutes. Nearly 1400-1500 passengers were on board and all were safe. Our doctors were also present at the accident site as well as the Nagpur railway station to provide medical assistance to passengers,” said Rao.

After coach S-9 was detached, passengers and their belongings were shifted to other coaches. Food and water were also provided to the passengers. The accident relief train also reached the site soon after the incident and rerailment was done. Initially, three front coaches were moved to Nagpur.

The remaining 16 coaches were later taken to Nagpur railway station at around 11.20am. Meanwhile, around 25 passengers were taken to Nagpur railway station by bus from Butibori. The train reached Nagpur station’s platform number 6 at around 11.50am.

Porters offered free service to the affected passengers. They quickly moved the luggage to the new bogie, a replacement for coach S-9.

The commercial staff, station staff and RPF personnel ensured that all the passengers got food. The entire restoration work was monitored by DRM Nagpur. The train left the station at around 12.20pm after a delay of over four hours.

187,['19/03/2020'],Metro installing solar panels atop stations at fast pace,"Metro aims to install 14MW and so far 1MW has been installed

Nagpur: MahaMetro, which aims to meet 65% of its energy requirement from solar, is installing panels atop its stations at a fast pace. Its aim is to install total 14MW and so far 1MW has been installed and work is going on another 1.5MW.

A Metro spokesperson said that solar energy was a win-win situation for the agency. “A private operator installs the panels through Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), a central government undertaking. We don’t spend a penny on it. We just provide the space in our stations. The operator sells power to us when the panels are installed. We get electricity at less than half of MSEDCL’s power tariff,” he added.

“At present we are meeting 85% of our electricity requirement of our stations through solar. Panels have been installed atop six stations and Metro Bhavan. The average monthly generation is more than one lakh units. Till date we have exported over 2.5 lakh units of electricity to MSEDCL. More than 10.5 lakh units of solar energy has already been generated, which saved more than Rs82 lakh for Nagpur Metro Rail Project so far,” said the spokesperson.

He further said that work on installation at five Metro stations and two depots for 1.5MW capacity was in progress. “MahaMetro is in the process of signing agreements for development of another 3MW for upcoming 10 stations and depot buildings. More than 5MW will be installed by March 2021,” he added.

MahaMetro is one of the first Metro Rail agencies to go for solar energy right from inception. Many agencies started switching to solar when they were asked by central government and when their electricity bill ran into crores.

Going green helped MahaMetro secure loans worth around Rs4,500 crore from German agency KfW and French agency Agence Francaise de Developpment (AFD). According to the spokesperson, foreign lending agencies prefer projects that are green.

“We are using green energy wherever possible as our aim is to reduce pollution in Nagpur. Our feeder vehicles will run on electricity or LPG. Our stations have bio-digesters to recycle water. Our stations have got Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) ratings,” he added.

188,['19/03/2020'],Give paid leave to those quarantined: UP to firms,"Noida: The Uttar Pradesh government has directed that all people kept in quarantine or isolation because of the novel coronavirus should be given mandatory paid leave by their organisations. It has also said that the state will bear the cost of treatment of all patients who test positive for Covid-19.

“All offices — government and private — will have to provide mandatory paid leave to employees in quarantine or isolation. The companies cannot avoid a state government order,” said B N Singh, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar. Government spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said CM Yogi Adityanath had advised private firms to allow employees to work from home, “but in such a situation, they should be paid full salary”.

The order will have maximum impact in Noida, where most private and multinational companies that operate out of UP are located. So far, there are six confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad and more than 10 people have been kept in isolation facilities. Around 500 people, including working professionals, have been put in home quarantine so far. Officials said all these residents will receive a certificate at the end of the 14-day quarantine.

Representatives from industry bodies said that while all government orders will be supported, it may be difficult to sustain companies if cases increase. “We are fully cooperating with all government directives and many companies have allowed leave as well as work-from-home option. However, entrepreneurs, especially MSMEs, are suffering economically already because of the virus scare. If it spreads to a point where we need to shut entire companies, it would be difficult to pay all staff with no output,” said Sudhir Srivastava, vice-president and spokesperson for Noida Entrepreneurs’ Association (NEA).

Sec 144 extended

The state government on Tuesday released an advisory for residents on social distancing and other steps needed to be taken by RWAs, offices, restaurants and government officials. The shutdown of all schools, colleges and universities has been extended till April 2. The imposition of Section 144 in the district, prohibiting all public gatherings, including political, cultural, religious, as well as sports programmes, was extended till April 5. In Gurgaon too, all restaurants at the popular Cyber Hub and One Horizon Center on Golf Course Road shut down on Wednesday.

One metre between tables

Meanwhile, restaurants have been advised keep outdoor seating if possible or with a distance of at least one metre between tables. They have also been asked to maintain hygiene, follow hand washing protocol and regularly clean things that are often touched, such as door handles and chairs.

Owners said that most restaurants are already following the guidelines. “It is not very difficult to maintain distance as restaurants are not seeing any crowd anymore. Many pubs, bars and cafes that had larger crowds have shut down since they did not have footfall or want large gatherings,” said Varun Khera, head of the National Restaurant Association of India in Noida.

Bodiyo had sought bail from the court claiming no involvement at all in the alleged extortion from the complainant Ashish Shinde. He told the court that he never met Shinde nor ever called him asking him to give the money. In his bail plea, Bodiyo said that the investigation in the case is over and other accused in the case have been granted bail by Gujarat high court. Thus, on the grounds of parity he also should allowed bail.

Opposing his bail application, additional public prosecutor Prakash Bhatt told the court that Bodiyo faces at least 59 cases of kidnapping, murder, assault, rioting and cheating in different police stations in Vadodara. If he will be allowed bail he will once again start his criminal activities, Bhatt argued.

But KCR sprang a surprise on Tuesday by announcing her candidature for the MLC seat under the Nizamabad local bodies.

Kavitha, who recently celebrated her birthday (March 13), could not have expected a better gift from the TRS president. Accordingly, she filed her nomination at Nizamabad collectorate on Wednesday. Polling for the local body MLC polls will be held on April 7 and counting will be taken up on April 9.

Kavitha suffered a defeat at the hands of BJP’s Dharmapuri Arvind in the Lok Sabha elections from Nizamabad, which was considered her pocketborough.

Speaking to the media, legislative affairs minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy said TRS would secure the seat with a huge majority. “Of the total 824 votes, both TRS and MIM have 532 votes. Congress has 140 and BJP has 85 votes. It is going to be a cakewalk for Kavitha,” he said. Apart from Prashanth, who accompanied her while filing the papers, party MPs and MLAs congratulated Kavitha.

Party sources see a silver lining as Kavitha could regain control of Nizamabad party affairs once she becomes the MLC.

191,['19/03/2020'],How Bikaner checked cholera spread in 1927,"Jaipur: Similar to what the country is doing to contain coronavirus, the erstwhile Bikaner state had done to combat cholera in 1927.

It had sealed its border by framing an Act to fight the spread of the disease by restricting the entry of unwell persons and imposing a penalty on those who violated the law. The Act existed till Bikaner state still it merged with the Union of India and later in Rajasthan.

The Act named ‘Khatarnak Phelne wali Bimario ka Act (Infectious disease Act 1927) was passed by the Bikaner state assembly in view of the spread of two diseases—plague and cholera — under the reign of Maharaja Ganga Singh (1880-1943). The Act says it will be applicable once the state notified the outbreak or pre-empt the spread of any infectious disease in the state or the neighbouring state.

Documents at Rajasthan State Archives Bikaner suggest that how the Act helped the state preventing its people from the spread of any infectious disease till it was merged with India. “It shows the wit and commitment of the ruler who ruled the state close to 90 years ago by granting special powers to health workers and enforcement agencies to screen any suspected patient of any infectious disease,” said Mahendra Khadgawat, director of Rajasthan State Archives Bikaner.

At present, the country has banned the entry of foreigners and sealed its borders as an effective tool to stop the spread. The erstwhile rulers have also on occasions formed check-posts at borders screening the entry of outsiders, health workers at public places including the railway station, bus station, kutchery (Court) and other public places. “Great emphasis has been laid on creating awareness on the infectious disease by pasting posters, banners and verbal announcements. I don’t see any parallel of this visionary Act in India during the time the country was taking on Britishers,” said Khadgawat.

The country is yet to make the violators of stringent measures as a punishable offence, the former rulers have granted the special powers under the Act to run a legal case against them. Reportedly, Ganga Singh was among the first king to have introduced state assembly in then united India.

196,['19/03/2020'],Cab drivers’ desperate plea: Suspend our EMIs,"Covid-19 has dealt a body blow to drivers operating on the app-based platforms

NEW DELHI: Sanjay Kumar* (42) who drives a cab for a living is dreading the first week of April — that’s when the monthly instalment for his cab’s loan is due.

“I’m afraid that this virus is going to finish me, one way or the other,” said Kumar. “Initially I was afraid of getting infected by a passenger; now I’m afraid of not getting any passenger.”

Covid-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus, has dealt a body blow to most drivers operating on the app-based platforms. They are definitely scared of infection. But now with educational institutions also shut in addition to cinema halls, malls and tourist places, and many private companies asking employees to work from home, it’s their livelihood that is at stake.

“Paying the EMI every month is a big burden. Even before this virus started affecting work, I had to work 12 hours or more to earn enough to run my house,” Kumar said. “There is hardly any work now even during morning and evening peak hours. There is just no passenger,” he rued. “If the situation remains this way, not only I won’t be able to pay my EMI but will also not be able to feed my family.”

The Sarvodaya Driver Association of Delhi has decided to request Delhi government to intervene.

“We are going to meet chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to request him to help us in getting EMIs postponed for a month or two. We don’t want the banks to waive it off but just to postpone it,” said Kamaljeet Gill, its president. “We are the backbone of NCR’s transport system and are requesting for some help in this tough time. We also want the app-based cab aggregators not to charge commissions now as the income is already down,” he added.

Both Ola and Uber, the cab aggregators, refused to comment about any dip in the demand or any step to help drivers.

Gill claimed the companies were not even providing masks or sanitisers. “The association is providing sanitisers to as many drivers as possible. They are bringing bottles and we are filling these with sanitisers at different points,” he said.

“I’m wearing a mask for my own safety and also to assure passengers that my cab is safe. I got the mask after great difficulties,” said Ajay Sharma, another driver. “I open doors for passengers so that they don’t have to touch the door handle. Many ask us to open the windows as they feel ventilation will help them avoid any infection,"" he said. ""I’m willing to entertain all requests as long as I’m getting passengers.”

Out of 32 students in the current batch, 15 students have already got placed in reputed firms through campus placements as the department is heading towards a record number of placements this year.

Market research major, Nielsen, has selected four students offering them Rs six lakh per annum package and another ten students with Rs 3.15 lakh per annum packages. Another city-based firm, Numerator, has picked up a student with Rs four lakh per annum salary.

“Every year, students of statistics get placed through campus placement but this year the response is much better compared to previous years,” said professor Hari Kataria, dean of faculty of science.

“We are heading towards a record number of placements as statisticians are getting more opportunities these days. Earlier, a handful of students used to get placed through campus placement. The rest would gradually get jobs within a period of six months to a year of clearing their exams,” said placement coordinator Dr Rupal Shah.

SP North (Unnao) Vinod Kumar Pandey told TOI that the police have procured the family profile of each and every mobile phone user across the village and are monitoring their activities to zero-in on the perpetrators of the crime.

“We are also scanning such mobile phones that were used to capture photos and the video footage of the ‘ Phaag ’ singing programme held in the vicinity which the girl had gone to witness on the occasion of Holi. Six police teams, comprising 12-13 personnel, have been formed for the task”, the SP added.

To recall, a 9-year-old girl succumbed to her injuries in a hospital in Kanpur after she was sexually assaulted and strangled on the day of Holi festival by an unidentified man in Bihar’s Bighapur area of Unnao on March 10.

The incident had occurred when the girl, a student of class V, had gone to witness ‘Phaag’, a singing event held in the vicinity on Holi.

Investigations had revealed that the accused, after luring the minor, took her to a nearby field where she was raped.

The locals informed the family members after they found the girl lying unconscious in a field. The police said that the girl was raped after which the rapist tried to kill her by strangulating her in order to conceal his identity. The police, on being informed, rushed the girl to the district hospital from where she was referred to a hospital in Kanpur where she died the same night.

202,['19/03/2020'],Gujarat: Education department orders Kutch University’s suspension over 'strip test',"College conducted a strip test on 68 girl students to check if they were in their periods

RAJKOT: The Kutch university has issued a show cause notice to Sahjanand Girls Institute of Bhuj on Wednesday asking the college authorities to reply within 24 hours why its affiliation should not be suspended. The move follows the state education department’s order to suspend the college’s affiliation after the inglorious episode of its authorities forcing 68 girls to undergo a ‘strip test’ to check their menstrual status last month .

The four female staff members, including the principal of the college, Rita Raniga, who herself led the demeaning exercise, were arrested and later released on bail. The other three staffers were Anita Chohan, Ramila Hirani and Nayna Gorasia.

Vice-chancellor of Kutch university, Darshna Dholakia told TOI, “We have issued the show cause notice following the state education department’s order. We will take further decision after the college authorities reply on Thursday.” However, she had no answer when asked about the future of the existing students if the varsity suspends its affiliation.

The college is run by the rules of Swaminarayan sect and its trustees, after the shameful incident came on the back foot, promising not to enforce the rules on the girl students.

The issue that TOI highlighted made headlines for its torture on the female students started with the discovery of a “used sanitary pad” found in the garden outside the college’s hostel premises. This led to an inglorious chapter of ignominy when the girl students were forced by the four female teachers to undress and were checked if they were having periods.

The episode opened the Pandora’s box on how the college was also forcing the girls to remain in isolation during the menstrual period in a basement and forced to sleep in a dingy room alone. The girls came out in the open with the trauma they had to undergo every single month, which forced a few to hide facts in order to skip this rigourous ordeal. The four staff members are also facing suspension from the college and inquiry ordered by NCW.

Nagpur: As the coronavirus epidemic looms large over the city, almost all the educational institutions have stopped academic activities and asked their students to stay at home. Some premier colleges have come out with innovative concepts to keep their students busy in what they termed as “forced break”.

At Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT), which is home to largest number of outstation students, the administration asked students to complete some assignments which would be uploaded on its website. “All over 3,500 students have now reached their respective homes after being told to evacuate hostels. We’ve told them that they can’t be sitting home ideally, as we would be providing them with assignments which would last for two weeks till the college is closed,” director Pramod Padole told TOI.

He added that the students would be told to read and prepare some part of the syllabus so that when the classes resumed it would be easy for the lecturers to explain the subject. “Moreover, assignments would also be posted on the website and the students have been told to monitor it regularly,” the director said.

The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Nagpur, has asked students to stay at their hostels and not to venture out. “We are conducting classes with the help of PowerPoint presentation and video conferencing. Since our syllabus is vast, we are using technology to conduct theory lectures. Proper care is being taken to ensure students remain inside our secured campus. We as doctors can’t stop treating patients,” director Vibha Dutta told TOI.

In the wake on unprecedented situation after the Covid-19 outbreak, the students staying in various hostels were told to vacate the premises and stay at home at least till March 31.

Nagpur University has already stopped all classes and also told its affiliated colleges to follow the suit. The university has also directed students staying in its hostels at Law College Square and PG hostel near campus to vacate rooms.

“Directives have already been issued in this regard and majority of them have left for home. As per the government’s directives, summer examinations commencing from March 19, comprising over 180 papers are already deferred and the students should utilize this extra time to study for their papers,” registrar Neeraj Khaty and exam director Prafulla Sable told TOI.

At Symbiosis International University (SIU), about 417 students staying in hostels were sent back home. “Most of them are from the MBA programme. Some faced problems while getting tickets, but eventually, we ave closed all four schools,” said SIBM director Shrirang Altekar.

Even at National Law University (NLU), about 450 hostel students left on their own after classes were suspended. “We allowed them to go home. Even the administration is working for just four hours,” registrar Ramesh Kumar said.

Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) director Omprakash Kakde said that over 200 students have vacated the hostels after academic activities were suspended. Similarly, at IIM, about 230 students left from the hostels for their respective homes after being told so, according to spokesperson Anagha Wankhede.

It has also received requests from other government offices to provide them with the device so that the temperatures of visitors and employees entering the premises can be measured.

However, the civic body is in a quandary as the supply of thermal guns has evaporated with the rise in the pandemic scare. Vendors have tried approaching sellers across the country, but have not been able to lay hands on a single device.

“We have reached out to distributors and even importers to get some such devices, but have not been successful,” said a supplier. The vendors have been working on procurement since Tuesday, but with little success.

The VMC, which has 34 UHCs, wants to allot two such thermal guns to each UHC to measure temperature of patients coming there. The decision is being taken to segregate those coming to the UHC with fever apart from other symptoms of an upper respiratory infection.

These patients would be segregated and kept away from the others to ensure that others do not get infected in case a COVID-19 patient approaches the UHC.

The civic body has already started making separate queues and making patients with a history of an upper respiratory infection with fever sit separately at UHCs.

This is, however, being done only on the basis of what the patients tell a staffer and not after measuring their temperature.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president Manjinder Singh Sirsa on Wednesday appealed to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, asking him to deposit some money into the accounts of daily wage labourers who were now unemployed due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Sirsa claimed that footfall of these labourers seeking langar at gurdwaras had increased considerably over the past few weeks, putting them and others at the risk of contracting Covid-19.

The Shiromani Akali Dal functionary said most labourers had no money to buy food for their family, leaving them with no option but to approach gurdwaras.

“The number of people coming to gurdwaras has increased manifold. We have absolutely no problem in serving the community and our gates will remain open to as many people as possible. However, the greater challenge is to prevent large gatherings and putting more people at risk,” Sirsa said on Wednesday.

The DSGMC president said the situation could deteriorate if not checked immediately. “I appeal to Delhi government to transfer some money immediately into their accounts so that few people as possible gather at temples and gurdwaras across the city,” he added.

Bangla Sahib, Rakabganj Sahib, Nanak Piao and Sisganj are some of the gurdwaras that have seen high footfall over the past week. Sirsa said all possible measures were in place at these gurdwaras, including regular sanitisation of the premises and langar halls. “Those serving food have been asked to use santisers and wash their hands every minute,” he added.

On Monday, DSGMC banned entry of foreigners into gurdwaras. “Since the langar serves lakhs of people each day, we have not stopped it all together but are taking all precautions,” Sirsa added.

DSGMC has been regularly disinfecting all handrails, lifts and chairs at gurdwaras, in addition to distributing 10,000 free face masks.

Nagpur: Eight persons are admitted to Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH, Mayo) and Government Medical College and Hospital ( GMCH ) as 28 new suspects of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) reported here on Wednesday. Of those admitted, one suspect was already under observation at the isolation ward no. 25 at GMC while rest were fresh cases.

No new positive case was reported from anywhere in Vidarbha. All the seven positive patients are stable and showing improvement, doctors said.

Throat swab samples of these eight were sent to the laboratory at Mayo hospital and results are awaited.

The three new patients admitted to GMCH include two men and one woman having travel history and contact with positive Covid-19 patients. A 23-year-old man from Trimurti Nagar and a 29-year-old man came in touch with a positive patient while the 20-year-old woman had travelled to the United Kingdom. The suspect already admitted is a 23-year-old woman who has travelling history to France. Seven sample reports from GMCH are awaited.

So far 159 suspects have been reported at these hospitals. Of this, 123 had to be admitted while 116 tests have been conducted.

Meanwhile, home minister Anil Deshmukh reviewed the preparations for Covid19 at the divisional commissioner’s office and assured that all facilities for Mayo and GMCH would be provided.

No new Covid-19 admission was recorded at Yavatmal GMCH on Wednesday. However, 98 persons are in home quarantine in the district. Beside the three positive patients, three suspects who showed symptoms are still in the isolation ward in GMCH Yavatmal.

“Condition of all of them are stable and they started showing improvement,” said resident deputy collector Lalitkumar Warhade. The GMCH faced hygiene issues with washermen showing unwillingness to wash the linen of isolated patients.

In Chandrapur, health administration was baffled as hundreds of students studying in Pune and Mumbai poured in en masse into Chandrapur on Wednesday following holidays declared to colleges and school.

Authorities refrained from screening these students as there is no advisory about doing so to people coming from places where positive patients or deaths were reported within the country.

District collector Kunal Khemnar said it is impossible to keep track of people coming by bus and trains into the district.

“Hence we have made an appeal to these students and others coming from places where positive patients have been found to remain in self quarantine. If any of them have come in contact with affected people or those who have travelled from foreign or any of them have travel to foreign countries during last two weeks should immediately report to nearest government hospital,” he said.

There was a brief panic at railway station here as nearly 700 students stepped down from Pune in the afternoon.

These students were asked to remain on the railway station till health advisers reached there and guided them about precautionary measures and self quarantine.

“They all have been asked to report to control room for coronavirus emergency if any of them develops any symptoms,"" said civil surgeon Dr ND Rathod.

Dr Rathod informed that four new England return from same family have been asked for self quarantine at their own home on Wednesday.

Several non-essential services have been shutdown in both Chandrapur and Yavatmal districts.

BAREILLY: Mounds of concrete left unattended on arterial roads after they were dug up to lay sewer lines have made commuting a nightmare for residents of Shyamganj, Civil Lines , Stadium Road and adjacent localities here.

Shopkeepers at Eit Pajaya Road near Shyamganj alleged on Wednesday that concrete had been lying alongside dividers on roads for several days in the area. Asim Ahmed, a shopkeeper, said, “Digging started in the first week of March and since then gravel and stone is lying near dividers on roads occupying large spaces.This has resulted in traffic congestion and made commute difficult. But authorities have not done anything.”

Two-wheeler riders said they were especially at risk since after rains the dug-up material had scattered throughout the road, causing them to lose balance.

Ankit Singh, a resident of Shyamganj, said, “Initially, when the work of digging roads began here, people had requested workers to remove any material from the road. They were assured that concrete would be lifted from the roads at the earliest. But it has been more than two weeks and nothing has been done to address the issue.”

Similar complaints were heard from Civil Lines and from areas near Police Lines. “Traffic congestion in the city was already an issue since construction of three flyovers is underway. But digging up the roads and leaving concrete behind has just worsened the situation,” said a local resident.

Civic authorities, however, told TOI that concrete piles had been cleared from most city areas.

“We had deployed field workers to clear the material from roads so traffic movement is not hampered. We will ensure that all roads are cleared at the earliest,” Bareilly municipal commissioner Abhishek Anand said.

COIMBATORE: The Economic Offense Wing (EOW) of the city police arrested ex-service man on Wednesday for duping close to 500 investors, who are mostly ex-service personnel or those in service, of more than Rs 20 crore. They have also launched a manhunt for his aide.

An investigation officer identified the accused as K Mani, 44, a resident of Coonoor in the Nilgiris district . His accomplice M Manjunathan , a native of Karnataka who has been residing in Coonoor, is on the run.

The officer said, “Two years ago, Mani told his friends, who had worked with him in military, that he was working with a reputed private firm and lured them into making a one-time investment of Rs 1.75 lakh to Rs 10 lakh by promising a handsome monthly interest and other surprise gifts. He asked them to transfer the amount to an account number through internet banking.”

The investors were paid interest and gold coins weighing 10g to 20g for the first few months. Taken up by the returns, they told about the investment to several people, mostly service personnel and their family members, who put their money in the scheme. To their shock, Mani abruptly stopped paying them monthly interest from May, 2019.

One of the victims, Lara Vinarasi, 35, a resident of Podhanur, had lodged a complaint with Economic Offense Wing sleuths.

COIMBATORE: A city-based private hospital extracted a portion of a woman’s liver through laparoscopy and transplanted it to her son, who was suffering from a genetic condition called progressive familial hepatic cholestasis and severe liver failure.

Since she underwent a laparoscopic surgery, the woman says she was back to normal in three days and was able to even take care of her son while he was recuperating from the surgery. Five-year-old Mugilarasu from Vandhavasi in Thiruvannamalai district was diagnosed with the liver condition when he was around two-and-a-half years old, because he was severely underweight, malnourished and had a bloated abdomen.

Though they tried curing the disease with medicines, a few months back doctors told Mugilarasu’s father Prabakaran , who works as an autorickshaw driver, and his mother Sakthi that the boy had no chance of a survival without a liver transplant.

Unable to delay the process any further, Sakthi came forward to donate the organ.

Ten days after the surgery at Gem Hospitals, Sakthi is moving around normally and able to take care of her son. Mugilarasu, who was 11kg before the surgery, is now able to take food properly after nearly four years. TNN

Dehradun: The long wait for relocation doesn’t seem to end for traders of Arhat bazaar - the city’s wholesale grain market. The traders claimed that the issue of their relocation has been pending for about 20 years now, but not much has progressed on the ground. Several meetings by MDDA officials in past few years were not fruitful.

The traders also claimed that their business has declined by 50% due to the restriction of loading and unloading of goods to a few hours. Sandeep Goyal, joint secretary, wholesale dealers association, said, “The demand for shifting of Arhat bazaar to a suitable place has been pending since the days when Uttarakhand was part of Uttar Pradesh and Kalyan Singh was the chief minister. Earlier, most of the goods supplied to Gangotri and Yamunotri regions was supplied from Arhat Bazaar, but now that supply has reduced to just 1%. Now, the grains are supplied by traders based in Vikas Nagar and Rishikesh.”

The business owners informed that to manage the traffic flow, the administration had placed a restriction on them to load and unload goods in vehicles after 10 pm and before 8 am. The restrictions have irked the buyers who now prefer getting goods from elsewhere, claimed business owners.

The traders informed that a few years ago they had met the MDDA officials who had proposed to shift them to Transport nagar but they had turned down the proposal as the space at the site was too less to accommodate 250 shops.

Instead, a tea estate situated near Shimla bypass was proposed to which all the traders had reportedly agreed.

Rajinder Goyal, president, wholesale dealers association, said, “We had even suggested that if the administration acquires the land and provide the basic infrastructure we can pay for the shops ourselves. At Arhat bazaar, it has become difficult to operate our business.”

The business owners also expressed their concern that Arhat bazaar doesn’t even have the washroom facility for shop owners or visitors.

Vice-chairman of Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority, Ashish Srivastava, told TOI, “The plan for relocation has been shared with representatives of the collective body of Arhat bazaar traders and the process would begin soon.”

Long queues of parked autorickshaws are visible in every auto stand. As the spread of Covid-19 hits several sections, autorickshaw drivers too are finding it difficult to make both ends meet.Instead of the usual three or four autorickshaws, there was a long queue in the auto stand at Statue on Wednesday evening. Many of them were waiting for more than five hours for a single trip.Kunjappan, an auto driver at Statue stand, said that it was difficult to get even two or three trips per day. “Today I have waited for five hours and got a single trip of Rs 30,” he said.Suresh, another driver, said that those who work with rented autos have stopped working. “They have to pay the owner Rs 250 per day irrespective of them getting a trip or not. Only people who own autos are working now,” he said.When asked whether they are concerned about spread of the disease, Kunjappan and Suresh said that they don’t discriminate the customers even if they show symptoms. Kunjappan said that frequent hand washing was not possible. “I wash before having food. We are not scared at all,” he said.Rajesh, a native of Karamana, said that the daily revenue has halved after the city reported Covid-19 cases. “I used to get Rs 800 daily. Now, it is not even half the amount. I also take trips for Uber auto. My Uber auto passengers were mostly north Indian families, who have left the place after Covid-19 cases were reported,” he said.Ravi, another driver, said that he too was not getting enough even after working extra hours. “Usually we get around Rs 30 for each trip. So you can assume how many trips we need to make in order to get a decent revenue. Apart from fall in number of passengers, we are also worried about our safety.Nalanchira Hari, state secretary of Kerala auto taxi light motor workers’ federation, said that the situation of auto and taxi drivers is miserable. “Apart from the poor revenue, the hike in fuel charges has become an added trouble for the workers. We have decided to request the government to provide some solatium for workers registered with the welfare board,” he said.When asked about chances for imposition of more restrictions, Kunjappan said that if government would ask people not to go out, there is no option for the auto drivers but to end their own lives.",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74713922,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-604049,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/auto-drivers-hit-as-more-people-stay-indoors/articleshow/74700273.cms

BHOPAL: Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan hit out at senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh for enacting a “drama” in Bengaluru on Wednesday.

“Digvijaya Singh is the biggest dramatist in the country. He is remembering the (rebel) MLAs now, when they have resigned from the party. But they do not even want to meet him,” Chouhan told reporters in Sehore district, where BJP MLAs are camping out.

Chouhan accused Congress of “dragging BJP into its internal squabble”. “BJP never interfered in Congress affairs. The rebel MLAs have clearly said how they were treated in the party and by the government. Now, the chief minister is remembering them. When were you for the last 15 months? Now, when the government is on the verge of collapse, you remember them?” said Chouhan.

He accused the Congress government of turning the state “into a den of corruption”. “Middlemen were running the 5th floor of Mantralaya. People were upset and troubled. The state is ruined and now the chief minister is making appointments and taking big decisions in a hurry. Congress has brought the state to the brink of destruction,” said Chouhan.

BJP chief whip Narottam Mishra also hit out at Digvijaya for the “political drama” in Bengaluru. “Digvijaya is trying hard to wipe out Congress from the state. Congress has dispatched a matchbox to douse the fire in Bengaluru. The way Digvijaya is playing a political drama there is a regular feature. This is not the first time he is doing this. Mr Bantadhar will ensure the end of Congress in Madhya Pradesh ,” said Mishra.

The rebel MLAs have refused to meet Digvijaya, the former minister said. “They have complained about the misconduct by Congress leaders. The chief minister never spared 15 minutes for them. This government is based on lies and the cabinet meeting being conducted to take new decisions is a farce,” he said.

BJP state chief VD Sharma accused Congress leaders and workers of “creating disturbance by holding protests and demonstrations against BJP”. “They sense their defeat. Congress leaders have lost the confidence of the public and their own MLAs. They are trying to blame and attack BJP workers but we will give a befitting reply to them,” said Sharma.

NAGPUR: In a joint operation, Sitabuldi police and officials from Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) on Wednesday raided a factory allegedly manufacturing fake hand sanitizers in Pakodewala gully.

Police have seized around 1,000 bottles of fake sanitizers worth Rs10,400.

The cops have also seized some chemicals and sent the samples to FDA laboratory for analysis.

“We had received a tipoff about an illegal unit manufacturing hand sanitizers. The cops roped in FDA officials and a joint team raided the unit. We are now awaiting test result from FDA officials to register an offence against the accused,” said senior PI of Sitabuldi police station JN Rajput .

The police are now trying to find out from where the accused had brought the chemicals to be sold as hand sanitizer.

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, demand for hand sanitizers and face masks has skyrocketed. Many miscreants are trying to cash in on the soaring demand by selling spurious chemicals as hand sanitizers.

Earlier, Gittikhadan police had arrested two persons who were selling fake sanitizers to medical store owners.

The state has 15 reserved assembly constituencies and one parliamentary constituency, and reservation in promotion has always been a thorny subject. Party sources told TOI that senior BJP leaders have been always “divided over the matter”.

BJP legislator Khajan Das said, “I am a staunch supporter of the reservation in promotion which was in practise earlier in Uttarakhand . I will again take up the matter with CM and senior members of the core committee.”

Das did not comment on political impact the government’s decision would cause but hinted at the low political dividends. “The decision will antagonise the reserved category across the state and may send a negative signal,” Das said.

Another BJP legislator Deshraj Karnwal viewed the decision as a personal setback. “I am personally saddened by the development. In the state assembly, I had supported the reservation in promotion but today I do not know how to react on this development,” said Karnwal.

BJP spokesperson and MLA Munna Singh Chauhan said, “The state government will take care of the interest of all government employees in Uttarakhand.”

Meanwhile, some BJP MLAs had been putting pressure on the CM to accede to the protesting employees’ demands of scraping the reservation in promotion.

254,['19/03/2020'],Maharashtra mantralaya lockdown due to Covid-19 hits egg export from Namakkal hard,"Representative image

NAMAKKAL: Egg exporters in the district are staring at a huge loss as shipments to Oman, Qatar and UAE have been stuck at various stages of transit in the absence of clearance from the home ministry officials in Maharashtra.

Having gone into lockdown mode in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, the Maharashtra mantralaya won’t be accessible to the exporters till March 31.

Pointing out that nearly one crore eggs worth Rs 5 crore have been at various stages of transit from the Mumbai port, the exporters said the cargoes can’t either be brought back or delivered at the end destinations in the present scenario. “They are likely to go waste,” an exporter said.

According to Dr P V Senthil, a leading egg exporter and general secretary of Livestock Agri Farmers’ Trade Association, they have to get export documents attested by both the chamber of commerce in Mumbai and Maharashtra home ministry officials before submitting them to the consulates of Oman, Qatar or UAE. “Only then they would accept the documents and issue papers to deliver the shipment in their countries.”

However, with access to the home ministry office restricted till March 31, the exporters have no other option to get the clearance papers for now.

“Without any prior intimation, officials simply closed the home ministry office. Sans its attestation, the documents and containers will not be accepted by the consulates of Oman, Qatar or UAE. The whole shipment is likely to go waste as eggs come with an expiry date,” Senthil said.

He said many containers had reached the destination, while the remaining were in transit. “The exporters are badly affected as most consulates are in Mumbai. If we won’t be able to deliver the cargoes in time, it will affect the country’s credibility also.”

The exporters have sought the intervention of both the state and central governments to find a solution to the issue. “On behalf of all exporters and in the national interest, we humbly pray the state and central governments to kindly make arrangements to accept the documents for attestation. This could be done at the entrance gate of mantralaya, where a staff member could collect the documents and return them the next day. Even token system is appreciated,” another exporter said.

Mohan Kumaramangalam , honorary president, Livestock Agri Farmers’ Trade Association, said the lockdown of Maharashtra mantralaya has hit the export of many agriculture, poultry, meat and food products worth several thousands of crores. “It will badly hit our economy and global trade. Appropriate steps should be taken at the earliest to ensure smooth export business,” he said.

Industrialists here are now working on the orders they got in the beginning of the month, president of the Coimbatore Sidco Industrial Estate Manufacturer's Welfare Association (Cosiema) P Nallathambi says. “Buyers from the US, Italy and Brazil used to come here to give orders and to negotiate prices. As they don’t come now, we fear there would be a downfall in orders in the coming months.”

The disease outbreak has not only impacted new orders, industrialists say they face the risk of not being able to clear the orders they have received. “We have got orders from Australia and Italy. Now the clients have asked us to hold the orders. They say they would buy it after June,” says state vice-president of the Laghu Udyog Bharati S Surulivel.

Micro job work units have also seen a decline in the orders. District president of the Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises (TACT) J James says after the initial rise in orders in the first week of March, they have not received new orders.

The situation will impact payment collection, bank loans and GST payments, says Surulivel. “The state and Centre should suspend all loan and interest repayments until the end of the year and revoke all penalties and penal interest related to GST. GST payment for the next three months should be deferred.”

James says the sale of main items produced by the MSMEs here such as pumpsets, wet grinders and automobile spares procured by neighouring states such as Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra, has taken a blow. “Depending on the manufacturing capacity of the units, an interest-free loan of Rs 50,000 to Rs 5lakh should be given. Also, a moratorium of one year should be given to industry loans and interests. Penalties should be waived off.”

But the Covid-19 scare has not affected the workers, the industrialists said, adding that they have been taking safety precautions such as using masks and sanitisers.

The sector is looking at massive job cuts, loss of revenues and permanent cessation of operations if things did not quickly come back on track.Already, February has proved one of the slowest months in recent history with the risk of infection deterring people from eating out. The pandemic couldn’t have come at a worse time since March is the month when annual taxes are paid and various licences come up for renewal.While restaurateurs are considering ways to stay afloat, the employees stare at an uncertain future. Many have already been sent on unpaid leave or asked to take a pay cut. The contracts of outsourced labour such as housekeeping, security and parking have also been terminated in many establishments.Restaurant body National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI) is reaching out to ministries and government departments for support. Anurag Katriar, president of NRAI, said the central and state governments had to step in. Else, the industry, which employs around eight million people, is looking at huge job losses.“We are meeting the authorities for restoration of input tax credit, deferment of licence renewals due in March, extension of licenses for a quarter without additional fees, GST relief and moratorium on repayment of interest on loans,” disclosed Katriar. He revealed that restaurateurs in their capacities are also reaching out to landlords for concession in rent dues. At his company, deGustibus Hospitality, which employs 700 people, Katriar is planning pay cuts to avoid job losses.Priyank Sukhija of First Fiddle Restaurants, which employs around 1,000 people across India, felt the government needs to consider itself a senior partner in the hospitality industry for its survival. While the decision was taken to close outlets to ‘flatten the curve’, if the situation persisted for a few months, most restaurants would not have funds to sustain themselves, said Sukhija.The hotel owner expects the government to offer a bailout package on the lines of the one given by governments abroad. Sukhija suggested that the government could utilise ESIC social security funds that various organisations contribute as a percentage of the salaries paid to staff salaries, given that this is an unprecedented emergency.Inderjeet Singh Banga of Biggie, which employs around 900 people, pointed out that to stay afloat a business needed to meet fixed costs such as rent, salaries and loan repayments. In the present scenario, the decision to cease operations is bad both in this context, he said. He was sure that if the government did not give clear directives to save the industry, numerous conflicts would arise between landlords and restaurant tenants, with the unfortunate possibility of closure of outlets and job losses. “After the airlines, we are worst hit by the virus,” Banga asserted. “That is why we need help from the authorities.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74701999,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35215,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/for-restaurant-owners-staff-a-recipe-for-disaster/articleshow/74701281.cms

COIMBATORE: The 50-bed Covid-19 quarantine centre set up at the hostel of the Tejaa Shakthi Institute of Technology for Women at Karumathampatti was fitted with 50 more beds on Wednesday.

Health department staff who cleaned the rooms and attached toilets also ensured that all cots had mattresses. The first inmates to the centre are likely to be the passengers of the Air Arabia flight from Sharjah, which will land here on Thursday morning.

A five-member medical team that will have at least a doctor will monitor the inmates, collector K Rajamani said. “The centre has a large hall, television, fans and medication for the comorbidities,” he told TOI.

While it was earlier decided to quarantine all asymptomatic people from the United Arab Emirates , Qatar, China, Oman, South Korea, Iran, Italy, Spain, Germany and France, authorities have now decided to quarantine only those above the age of 60 and those with comorbid conditions like diabetes and heart issues, the collector said. “The district administration has assuaged the fears of Karumathampatti residents regarding the quarantine centre. We explained who would be quarantining here.”

As many as 100 local residents had staged a protest in front of the facility and blocked the collector’s car on Tuesday evening.

Meanwhile, the testing centre for Covid-19 being set up on the Coimbatore Medical College premises is soon expected to get clearance from the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. “They have completed the preliminary procedures after the equipment and kits arrived as per the Indian Council of Medical Research’s protocols. The clearance from NIV is expected either Wednesday night or Thursday,” Rajamani added.

261,['19/03/2020'],Nirbhaya case: Last meeting done for all but 1 convict,"NEW DELHI: The family members of three Nirbhaya convicts have already had their “last meeting”, when they were allowed to meet in a closed room and touch each other. However, Akshay Thakur’s family is yet to come and his wife and parents have been asked to meet him by Thursday, a Tihar Jail source said.

The four death-row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape-and-murder case are scheduled to be hanged on Friday.

An official said the family members of Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma met them on February 29. Both of them broke down and jail officials had to console Sharma after he started crying inconsolably, he added.

The other convict, Mukesh Singh , mostly kept quiet during his meeting on March 2 while his family members had occasional emotional outbursts, a source said. Singh apparently kept assuring them that he still had legal options left to save himself from the gallows. A court on Tuesday rejected Singh’s plea claiming he was not in Delhi when Nirbhaya was gang-raped in a moving bus in south Delhi.

Even after the “last meeting”, the families are allowed their weekly interactions with the convicts, but no separate, one-to-one meeting is permitted.

Thakur, meanwhile, had told the Tihar authorities that his family members would meet him on Wednesday. An official said he seemed to have lost hope that his family members would meet him after his wife decided to seek a divorce.

“We facilitated a phone call between him and his wife after this. He then claimed that his wife would come and meet him on Wednesday,” said the official. His wife, Punita Devi (29), has filed a divorce case in a court in Bihar’s Aurangabad, saying she doesn’t want to live the rest of her life as a widow.

Meanwhile, the preparations for the hanging are in full swing and dummy executions have been carried out. Officials are also keeping a tab on the health of the four men and additional staff have been deployed outside their solitary cells to avoid any untoward incident.

Another accused, Ram Singh, committed suicide inside Tihar, while a juvenile has been freed after serving his term at a Home.

BHOPAL: After senior party leader Digvijaya Singh was detained briefly on Wednesday by Bengaluru police, Congress workers swung into action in the state capital in protest.

Besides, Congress MLAs called on the governor at Raj Bhavan to enlist his support to “free” the 22 Congress MLAs who, according to them, are held captive by the BJP in Bengaluru. The memorandum handed over to governor Lalji Tandon referred to detention of Digvijaya Singh at Bengaluru and said that he was only trying to meet the Congress MLAs in the resort to enlist their support in the Rajya Sabha election.

They urged the governor to use his constitutional authority to secure release of the 22 Congress MLAs.

Meanwhile, a group of Congress workers tried to gherao a resort in Sehore district, where BJP MLAs are currently lodged. In an apparent act of “Gandhigiri”, they wanted to present roses to the BJP MLAs in protest of Digvijaya Singh’s detention and, as they described, against the BJP’s “sinister design” to topple the Kamal Nath government. However, they could not break into the resort due to heavy presence of police force and persuasion by administrative officers to disburse.

His house had caught fire in May last year. “Property worth Rs2 lakh was destroyed, I haven’t earned enough to recover the losses yet,” he says. Taking out a few notes of hundreds from his pocket, he says, “This is the only money I have.”

Patel is an immigrant from Rewa in Madhya Pradesh where the house in which his family stays was burned.

The coronavirus scare had already reduced the earnings of many like Patel. Now, the closure order for eateries and roadside vendors till March 31 has pushed them to the brink. For many like Patel, subsistence depends on what they earn every day.

“I have to pay Rs4,000 as rent for the room at Vasantrao Naik Nagar shanties. So far, I have earned only Rs6,000. All the expenses can be met only if the earning are at least Rs10,000, but the daily sales have already halved,” he says.

Many of the vendors who are immigrants from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh or Uttar Pradesh say they will be forced to go back to their native villages and take up work as daily wagers there.

The Vasantrao Naik hutments near Bhole Petrol pump are home to around 100 street vendors . In the afternoon itself, handcarts could seen been parked outside their homes.

“We can pull on for a month and even more,” said one of them. Others pounced on him, literally. “How can you say that? don’t you have to eat every day,” asked a woman. “I have six mouths to feed and I am the only bread winner in the family. Do you think I can manage,” asked another in his late fifteen.

Which means we have to pay back the advance money received for an event. This is again a burden the industry has to face when it is battling to stay afloat,” said Mahavir Sharma, an EEMA member.The auxiliary segments supporting the events industry engage local artists, caterers, tent providers, security personnel, taxi services, and a range of suppliers who are now also sitting idle without any business and keeping their fingers crossed.The industry body has sought an appointment with the chief minister with a list of relief package for the sector to ride out the difficult times.It has appealed the government to pay the companies all dues for the work that has been completed so that they will be able to pay the staff their salaries on time. Similarly, a moratorium of 9-12 months on payments in the form of EMIs and interests to banks has also been proposed.“We also want the state government to convince the GST Council to waive taxes for a 12-month period so that the industry can recover. Besides, we want that the state should allow us its venues for use at very minimal rates whenever the situation improves. That would to some extent reduce the financial burden on us,” added Chaturvedi.According to industry sources, all the events up to the end of April have been cancelled. Leading hotel chains have announced to refund all the advance money deposited with them for events up to April-end which has been another factor for cancellations.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rs-5k-crore-blow-to-events-hospitality-industry-in-raj/articleshow/74700351.cms

BHOPAL: With senior Congress leaders, including Digvijaya Singh and five ministers arrested in Bengaluru, CMKamal Nath on Wednesday said he may head for the southern city that has been one of the focal points of the Madhya Pradesh political crisis that started a fortnight ago.

“BJP is killing democracy in Madhya Pradesh. BJP is nervous about bringing our 16 MLAs to the state. What is the crisis in one person meeting the legislators? In 15 months, we have proved majority and faced floor-test several times. If need be, I will also go to Bengaluru,” Nath said around noon on Wednesday.

The chief minister also said that he tried to contact Karnataka chief minister BS Yeddiyurappa and Union home minister Amit Shah in the evening but both of them did not call him back .

“It is entirely dictatorial to stop, misbehave and forcefully arrest Digvijaya Singh, Congress ministers and MLAs who went to meet their party legislators held captive by BJP in Bengaluru,” said Nath.

“The entire country is seeing how BJP is murdering democratic values to destabilise an elected government. Why are we not being allowed to meet the MLAs? After all what is BJP afraid of? A dirty game is being played by BJP in the state,” was his next.

Democratic values, constitutional values and rights are being suppressed, the CM alleged, adding: “Our arrested leaders should be released soon and allowed to meet the hostage MLAs.”

Attacking BJP, CM Nath tweeted, “BJP does not have majority right now, neither has Shivraj Singh Chouhan been elected leader of the BJP Legislative Party . BJP government has not been formed, neither will it be formed. But Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s urgency and restlessness to become chief minister is seen by the entire state.”

The CM’s final tweet in this volley said: “How they are getting restless for power! They are sleepless, day-dreaming of becoming chief minister. They are threatening officials. I pity their condition.”

JAIPUR: The outbreak of Covid-19 has made a dent on fat destination weddings which were scheduled to be held in coming months.

The event managers have to return the advance which they had taken from non-resident Indian clients for weddings slated for April. Besides, managers and their clients have crossed their fingers for upcoming marriages in May, June and July.

Rajasthan and its archaeological beauty appeals many non-resident Indians (NRIs), celebrities from Hollywood and Hindi film industry to organize weddings in the state.

TOI on Tuesday spoke to various wedding managers who deal with global clients from United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), Italy and some parts of Europe.

“Every day, we are getting calls from them. Since Jaipur reported the Italian couple affected by coronavirus, I got calls from my clients in US and UK who urged me to cancel their upcoming weddings in April,” said Siddhartha Chaturvedi, a wedding manager based in Jaipur told TOI.

He added that in this particular case, where people are affected and are scared of travelling, the wedding managers and the hotels are giving the full refund of the booking amounts. “Usually if our client cancels without valid reason, we don’t repay the advance we take because of various operational costs. But in this case, we have to repay their advance. This year would be worst-ever for the state when we talk about marriage management and destination weddings,” Chaturvedi added.

He said many weddings were planned in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer which are either on the verge of cancellations or the clients are jittery.

“This year, the auspicious days for Hindu marriages which are usually more in winters are actually more in summers starting from April to August. We were thinking of getting good business while because of the corona scare, big losses underway,” said Mohit Sand, another Jaipur-based wedding planner.

In the present scenario, people may mistake it as covid-19 and panic. Doctors have advised citizens not to fear but also not to ignore these symptoms.“Every cough, cold and fever cannot be covid-19. Most of them are local infections due to weather change and can be treated by your family doctors,” said pulmonologist Dr Sameer Arbat.“But no one should ignore these symptoms in the present scenario. Consult your doctor, and get yourself treated immediately. Most importantly, follow the social distancing practices strictly until you have these symptoms,” Dr Arbat said and added that many citizens are still taking covid-19 casually.“Despite several guidelines and instructions, many are still not avoiding public gatherings . These restrictions are for our own safety. Sudden change in weather has increased risk of viral infections. We can’t afford any viral infection to spread,” he said.In Vidarbha, covid-19 has been detected in only those having travel history or those who came in close contact of positive patients. “Local transmission of coronavirus is not yet detected in Nagpur which is a good news,” said Dr Pritam Agrawal, infectious disease specialist.“Three of the four positive patients in Nagpur have travel history while the one is wife of a positive patient which means the person in close contact. Similarly, three positive patients in Yavatmal have direct travel history to Dubai. No one from their families is affected so far.“So, if you get cough or cold due to this sudden weather change, don’t think that you have covid-19. Most cough and cold due to weather change get cured with general medicines within four to five days,” she said.Similar weather conditions are going to prevail for the next 48 hours at least, states IMD.

Returning officer Pramil Kumar Mathur said none of the four candidates withdrew their name on the last date.

Congress has named K C Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi as its candidates while the BJP has named Rajendra Gehlot. The BJP, however, sprang a surprise by fielding Omkar Singh Lakhawat, who filed his nomination at the last minute.

With Lakhawat staying in the fray, a keen contest is on the cards for the three seats.

According to the strength of the MLAs, the Congress could win two seats and BJP one. By fielding a second candidate, the saffron party is trying to test the pollical waters and keep the Congress, which is now fighting the flight of MLAs in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, on tenterhooks.

The BJP has 75 MLAs including its alley RLP while ruling Congress enjoys the support of 123 MLAs including independents and supporting parties in the 200-strong assembly. BJP requires the support of at least 27 MLAs to win the second seat. It seems an impossible task.

Rajasthan has a total of 10 Rajya Sabha seats and nine of them, including the three which are going to polls on March 26, are held by the BJP.

Congress’s only Rajya Sabha member from Rajasthan is former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was elected unopposed in the RS bypolls held last year after the seat fell vacant following the death of BJP's Rajya Sabha member Madan Lal Saini.

But, dinner on Tuesday night was vastly different, with the entire family sitting down to share a meal, and an exotic one at that – nasi goreng whipped up by Ruchi and her daughter Parthivi.

“For the last one year I have been travelling 20 days a month, so I am super excited about this time I now have at home with my child,” says Ruchi. Since the Covid-19 scare, her husband Apurva spends just a couple of hours at work while she has opted to stay at home. And with schools closed, the entire family is now spending more time together than that they have in the last few years.

The fear of contracting Covid-19 has brought about a change of lifestyle for many. With employees being asked to work from home, and schools and colleges closed, families are now spending more time under one roof. And many are using this time to strengthen bonds, catch up on old hobbies, learn new skills, be more mindful and start new exercise regimes.

“With more time on my hands I wanted to try something new. My daughter wanted to have the Indonesian dish nasi goreng, so I googled the recipe and we made it together. She also googled fun facts about Indonesia, put it on post-its and stuck it around the dining table,” says Ruchi. “The whole family sat down to dinner, discussed the trivia and not once did we mention anything to do with coronavirus.”

In the next few days, the family also plans to do some craft and watch old classics. “We have a projector and we wanted our daughter to watch movies we had grown up on, like ‘The Sound of Music’,” says Ruchi.

Apurva, her husband, says that, “Now every day feels like Sunday. There’s not much traffic on the road, we did our grocery shopping at 3:45pm on a weekday, and whatever work is happening is happening on our laptops. It’s like you have to do whatever you were doing with your families in the 1980s, except now you have the Internet and Netflix .”

Sangeetha Arul, a homemaker in Thiruvanmiyur, says she wants to teach her 11-year-old son Alan how to play cards. “My uncle and aunt taught me and I want him to learn too. He loves to bake with me so we will bake butter cookies and sponge cake provided he spends one day cleaning up his room on his own. Since we don’t want to order food, it will address that issue too,” says Sangeetha, whose husband is out of the country.

Mridula Swamy, 38, a teacher and single parent, says she will just “chill out” with her sons, Aadhav, 11, and nine-year-old Vihaan. “We plan to try out some science experiment kits we bought but never used, do some spring cleaning, and also play badminton and run or cycle so that all of us get some exercise,” she says.

Author and textile specialist Sabita Radhakrishna , who is in her 70s, is catching up on old hobbies. “I have started painting and doing crochet again. I also plan to take out my sewing machine, and mend some of my old clothes,” says Sabita.

293,['19/03/2020'],Chennai: How to embrace learning outside of school,"Representative image

CHENNAI: It isn’t surprising that for the last couple of weeks, as schools in more than a dozen countries have closed down as a precautionary measure against Covid-19, ‘how to homeschool ’ has been trending on Google. On Monday, parents in Chennai joined that search.

But as moms and dads in the city grapple with the idea of how to teach their children, homeschooling parents -- who have embraced this way of life for years now -- offer tips and resources on how to school away from school.

“Remember, school is out, so there is no rigid timetable to follow. Begin the day with what your child wants to do,” says Deepa Dixon, city-based homeschooling mom of a 13-year-old. “Look at homeschooling as a time to understand your child’s strengths and weaknesses in subjects or lessons,” says Dixon. “You don’t have to study a subject for 45 minutes and then jump to the next. This is an opportunity to explore the lesson or subject without a time constraint.”

Also, says Dixon, her experience has taught her that allowing a child to decide the schedule of study can give parents clues into what their child is thinking. “If for instance, every single day your child says they want to do math, clearly they love the subject. But if you find that if you suggest a certain subject and they keep saying they don’t want to do it, perhaps it is time to explore why. Is it a lack of comprehension, some difficulty they are facing at school?”

Homeschooling is not just about learning subject lessons, says Ijeoma Akomolafe , homeschooling mom from Egmore. “It’s also about learning life lessons.” Akomolafe has two children – six and two – and ensures the elder sibling reads to or teaches the younger one. “It gives them a sense of responsibility,” she says.

Akomolafe says that what works for her is using everyday activities and chores as tools for learning. “Younger children love helping out in the kitchen and around the house. And that offers avenues for practical learning,” she says. For instance, writing letters of the alphabet with rice, baking to learn science, card games for maths.

Meenakshi Umesh, who homeschooled her now grown-up children on a farm in Dharmapuri , says doing household chores is something parents must inculcate in their children during these weeks. “Teach them to do everyday tasks properly. Washing clothes, a little cooking, housecleaning. In homeschooling, housework is homework. It boosts self-confidence.”

But, our teams used their local networks and found out these residents and carried out the health check-ups. Fortunately, none of them showed Covid-19 symptoms. We have kept them and their family members in home quarantine for 14 days and are keeping a tab on their health,” NMC sources told TOI.Recently, the municipal corporation had formed 37 teams to scan each part of the city to zero in on residents with foreign travel history, especially from the severely-affected countries. The main task of these squads was to locate such overseas travellers whose names were not in the lists.District collector Suraj Mandhare, district civil surgeon Suresh Jagdale and civic chief Radhakrishna Game are in touch with each other on a daily basis to ensure that no one with travel history goes unchecked after reaching Nashik city.So far, the local administration has data of 150 Nashikites with travel history which was furnished by the state government and some had self-reported to the local authorities after reaching the city.“Our teams comprising medical officer and few other para-medical personnel are extremely vigilant in the city to identity such overseas travellers whose names are not in the list,” added NMC sources.According to a senior district administration functionary, the airports cannot be blamed for a few names that go missing from the list. “The workload of the airports at present is huge.

BHOPAL: In fresh videos that surfaced on Wednesday, the rebel Congress MLAs supporting Jyotiraditya Scindia holed up in Bengaluru, have refused to speak to senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh. The videos surfaced soon after Digvijaya Singh who went to meet the rebel MLAs in Bengaluru was arrested.

Former ministers in Digvijaya Singh cabinet during 1998 -2003, Aidal Singh Kansana and Bisahulal Singh who are among the rebel MLAs refused to speak to him.

Six-time-MLA, Bisahulal Singh said in a video clip, “For a year, I kept pleading to include me as a minister in the government. For 40 years, I accepted Digvijaya Singh as my leader, but he made a fool of me. Nepotism and blind love for his son made the Congress to drop my name from the list of ministers before the swearing-in. I will not speak to him, let him go back honorably.”

Another video showed Aidal Singh Kansana saying, “We came to know that Digvijaya Singh and other MLAs are in Bengaluru. For a year, we did a lot of talking and they did not listen to us. What will he do after talking to us for one day?”

Expelled minister Govind Singh Rajput said, “We have come here out of free will. All of us came here willingly. In the morning, we came to know that Digvijaya Singh has come and is unnecessarily creating trouble telling the staff and guards at the gates that he wants to meet us. We do not want to meet him. All the MLAs here have sent their resignations.”

Another expelled minister Imarti Devi said in a fresh video that she has come to know of Digvijaya Singh’s visit to Bengaluru. “I have just come to know that Digvijaya Singh has come here to meet us. We have fled from Madhya Pradesh because of Digvijaya Singh. He has destroyed the party. We do not want to be in a party which has Digvijaya Singh. I appeal to the Bengaluru police to protect us from Digvijaya Singh, we absolutely don’t want to meet him,” she said.

PUDUCHERRY: Puducherry Lok Sabha MP V Vaithilingam has urged the Centre to extend 25% reservation for Puducherry students in all courses offered by Pondicherry University .

Vaithilingam made the plea during the zero-hour in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. He said the university presently extends 25% reservation for Puducherry students only in 21 courses whereas the university offers 158 postgraduate and research programs. He said Pondicherry University established in 1985 is the only university in the Union territory.

“There is no state or private university in Puducherry. All the government and private colleges are affiliated to Pondicherry University. Initially, 25% of the seats were reserved for the students of Puducherry in eight courses. Subsequently, it was extended to 21 courses only whereas the university presently has 15 schools and 51 departments offering 158 postgraduate and research programs,” he said.

Vaithilingam pointed out that the university did not extend the reservation for Puducherry students for the courses launched after 2013 as it did not get the nod from the Union human resource development ministry.

“Due to this, the students of Puducherry are forced to compete through all India quota and our students are affected very much. I request the government to extend the reservation of 25% to the students of Puducherry for all the courses offered by the Pondicherry University,” said Vaithilingam.

Bedi reacted sharply to Narayanasamy's move stating that the high court dismissed the single judge order, which the chief minister used to threaten the officials with contempt of court proceedings. She said the appeal filed against the single judge order by her and the Centre was allowed by the high court bench. The bench's order reiterated that Puducherry was governed by the Union Territory Act, the Business Rules and the Financial Rules.""The same laws and rules have been tested in two preceding judgments of Honble Madras High Court which came a few weeks back, such as in the selection of the election commissioner and the decision of direct transfer money for free rice for BPL and APL being upheld.

Her frustration resonated among the other parents in the room. Srilatha’s daughter Sabari Sirisha has been stuck in Rome since her flight was cancelled on March 11.“Our children don’t have food to eat. They are depending on others’ alms. My daughter is having one meal a day and sleeps at night after drinking water,” said Vijaylakshmi, whose daughter Sushma Narela, is also stuck in Rome. Parents said a local gurudwara was trying to help with some meals.Most students were on the same Air India flight and were asked to bring fitness certificates a few days before they were scheduled to travel. While the students went from pillar to post, local health authorities refused to give them certificates citing an overburdened healthcare system.“Italian authorities are saying they can’t treat their own citizens leave alone Indians,” said Upendera Gandla. He said that for 36 hours his daughter and others were told their flight would take-off, but was eventually cancelled. “I appeal to ministers KT Rama Rao and Eatala Rajendra to get our children back and isolate them here if need be,” he said.Gandla said after a lot of pressure, the Embassy finally got medical tests done and sent them to Pune for testing. “It has been days after the test, but they continue to keep us in the dark,” he said. Some parents said their children who left their university hostels had no option to go back. While the Embassy put them up at local hotels, they were now being told to vacate.D Rajender said he has not heard from his son Deepak for the past 24 hours. “I am worried about his safety. Recently, students from Milan were allowed to travel back without fitness certificates, so why are those in Rome stuck.” He said that with banks shut in the Italian capital, their children were left penniless in a foreign country.“We have been given two helpline numbers none of which are being picked up,”said Ramakrishna, whose sister Soumya is in Rome. His father Ravinder Reddy said it was ironic that despite his daughter not being able to travel back, flights could still be booked. “This shows a lack of coordination between authorities. On one hand, their flight is cancelled, on the other we can book another on their name. There are no disclaimers for fitness certificates,” he said.Ramakrishna also mentioned that he had heard of 14 students travelling by an airlines that did not ask for a fitness certificate. “We have to see if they will be successful in reaching India as they have to make a stop at Addis Ababa,” he said.Meanwhile the Indian Embassy in a three-part tweet said: “Indian Embassy Rome is doing all that is possible within its limited resources and despite the current lockdown, to support and assist more than 300 Indian students in Rome and nearby areas...Swab tests have been taken over the weekend and reports are awaited. We have explained to them what the next step would be.

Most of these students are from Hyderabad, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru with many flying back via Malaysia.An advisory issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on March 17 prohibits the entry of passengers from Afghanistan, Philippines, Malaysia to India and states that no flight from these destinations can take off for India after 3pm IST.“We were in transit in Malaysia when we were informed about the advisory.

He was booked on an AI flight to Mumbai at 7.45pm (Singapore local time). “We are helpless and stuck here for over seven hours now. We appeal to the government to help.

304,['19/03/2020'],"‘Covid-19 has spread, hasn’t become deadlier’","Q. COVID-19 has been described as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. What does that mean? What is UNICEF doing?A: Characterising COVID-19 as a pandemic is not an indication that the virus has become deadlier. Rather, it’s an acknowledgement of the disease’s geographical spread. UNICEF has been preparing and responding to the epidemic of COVID-19 around the world, and is working with governments and partners to stop transmission of the virus and keep children and their families safe.Q. Does COVID-19 affect children?A: As this is a new virus, we are still learning about how it affects children. We know it is possible for people of any age to be infected with the virus, but so far there are relatively few cases of COVID-19 reported among children. But the protection of children and educational facilities is particularly important.Q. Can pregnant women pass coronavirus to unborn children?A: At this time, there is not enough evidence to determine whether the virus is transmitted from a mother to her baby during pregnancy, or the potential impact this may have on the baby. This is currently being investigated. Pregnant women should continue to follow appropriate precautions to protect themselves from exposure to the virus, and seek medical care early, if experiencing symptoms.Q. Is it safe for a mother to breastfeed if she is infected with coronavirus?A: Considering the benefits of breastfeeding and the insignificant role of breastmilk in the transmission of other respiratory viruses, the mother can continue breastfeeding, while applying all the necessary precautions. For symptomatic mothers well enough to breastfeed, this includes wearing a mask when near a child (including during feeding), washing hands before and after contact with the child (including feeding), and cleaning/disinfecting contaminated surfaces – as should be done in all cases where anyone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 interacts with others, including children. If a mother is too ill, she should be encouraged to express milk and give it to the child via a clean cup and/or spoon – all while following the same infection prevention methods.Q. How to protect school kids from COVID-19?A: One of the best ways is to simply encourage regular handwashing with soap, for at least 20 seconds. Focus on communicating good health behaviours, such as covering coughs and sneezes with the elbow and washing hands.

306,['19/03/2020'],BBMP’s plea for suggestions on budget unheard,"The ideas can be submitted on the BBMP website or dropped in suggestion boxes placed at the Palike headquarter... Read More

BENGALURU: Two days after BBMP sought suggestions from citizens , Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and institutions for its 2020-2021 budget, not a single communication has reached the civic agency.

While residents and citizen-activists claimed they didn’t know such a notice was issued and saw a plot in it being tucked away in some corners, BBMP officials said the poor response should be viewed in the light of complaints that they never indulge in public consultations.

The ideas can be submitted on the BBMP website or dropped in suggestion boxes placed at the Palike headquarters. March 20 is the last date to respond.

“Last year, we hadn’t issued the advertisement properly but this time we did it well in advance and gave people five days to respond. It’s the third day today and we haven’t got any suggestion,” a senior BBMP official said on Wednesday afternoon.

However, citizen-activists faulted BBMP for sticking to a single mode of publicity, which fails to grab eyeballs. Wondering why the notice never made it to any of the Palike’s social media handles, they pointed out that the BBMP commissioner and mayor have 42,000 and 58,000 followers on Twitter, respectively.

Unni Krishnan, a resident of Jalahalli, said he didn’t know about the notice until somebody informed him. “BBMP puts out a small ad in a newspaper but most people’s focus is on the news,” he said, adding: “The agency should display these notifications in public spaces frequented by people. Also, public consultations about budget preparation should be held in every ward.”

Vishnu Prasad, member of Bellandur Development Forum, said: “The civic body doesn’t want to give better publicity to such things as it’s afraid of our suggestions.”

“The agency should focus on bringing about a transparent process, wherein everyone knows what’s happening in the corporation,” said Kavitha Reddy, a resident of HSR Layout.

However, BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar said: “We have done our best to publicise the issue. People need to be more interested in it instead of complaining.”

307,['19/03/2020'],Bill seeks to halve tenure of panchayat heads in Karnataka,"KS Eshwarappa

BENGALURU: The government on Wednesday tabled a controversial bill which reduces the tenure of gram, taluk and zilla panchayat presidents and vice-presidents to half — from five to two-and-a-half years.

The Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Raj (amendment) bill 2020 was tabled by RDPR minister KS Eshwarappa amid the din over the Madhya Pradesh political crisis.

While the debate on the bill is yet to begin, the proposed amendments suggest a drastic change in the original act. According to government sources, the decision to curb the tenure has primarily been taken due to “political considerations”.

“It is basically to share power among more people. Panchayat presidents and vice-presidents function under political patronage. They (parties) don’t like one person to be president for the entire five-year duration,” said a government official, adding that even now, political parties force panchayat presidents and vice-presidents to step down after 30 months.

Yet another reason for the amendment is to reverse the changes brought about by the 2014 Congress regime. A committee led by former Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar had presented a comprehensive report giving complete power to panchayat presidents and vice-presidents for a full term of five years from 30 months.

Another amendment has been proposed to safeguard the tenure of presidents and vice-presidents for at least 15 months, with the government suggesting no motion for no confidence will be moved against them till the expiry of half their tenure.

In other amendments, the government has said any no-confidence motion has to be moved in the presence of the district’s deputy commissioner. The government has also proposed an amendment to allow liquor shops to be open till 48 hours before polling.

308,['19/03/2020'],"Bengaluru: Cops stop Digvijaya from meeting Madhya Pradesh MLAs, detain him","AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh with KPCC president DK Shivakumar in Bengaluru on Wednesday

BENGALURU: High drama prevailed outside a private resort near Devanahalli early on Wednesday, after local police stopped Congress Rajya Sabha member and AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh from meeting the 19 rebel Madhya Pradesh MLAs holed up inside and took him into preventive custody. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president DK Shivakumar and a few party legislators were also detained .

In a reminder of Shivakumar’s protest in Mumbai in 2019, when he tried to meet then Congress rebel MLAs to save the coalition government in Karnataka, Singh tried to drive home the point that state police and the ruling BJP government were not allowing him to meet the MLAs.

“I have repeatedly urged police to meet my voters, considering that I’m contesting the Rajya Sabha elections on March 26. However, I’ve been told my own estranged party colleagues don’t want to meet me. BJP has forcefully kept them in this resort and has even snatched their mobiles,” alleged Singh, while sitting on a dharna along with other party members. He alleged BJP had tried to lure the Congress legislators with sums up to Rs 30 crore each.

However, extending an olive branch to the rebels, Singh said the Congress high command was ready to hold talks directly if they had any concerns. “If we have erred or irked you (rebels), then we are ready to talk to you. Soniaji, Rahul Gandhiji, Priyankaji or Kamal Nathji will directly talk to you,” said Singh.

Rebels in videos: Don’t want to meet him

The 19 rebel MLAs released videos claiming they had nothing to do with Singh and didn’t want to meet him. They said he was only indulging in drama after having ignored them in the past.

Early on Wednesday morning, Singh was welcomed at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) by newly appointed KPCC chief Shivakumar and Karnataka Congress legislators, including Krishna Byregowda and NA Haris.

Police decided to initiate action against Singh and the others for protesting in a public space without authorisation. They were detained, taken to Amruthalli police station and released after two hours. Later, Singh addressed the media and said he will sit on a fast until he’s allowed to meet the legislators.

According to Congress functionaries, he’s staying at a star hotel in Ganganagar and hadn’t broken his fast till late evening. Meanwhile, Singh and Shivakumar met DG and IGP Praveen Sood to question police’s decision to detain them, asking him to intervene and assist them in meeting the rebel MLAs.

BHOPAL: The Kamal Nath government’s big decisions continue in the thick of political crisis. On Wednesday, the cabinet approved creation of three districts — Maihar, Chachoda and Nagda.

Maihar was the claim of rebel BJP MLA Narayan Tripathi and Chachoda that of Laxman Singh, Digvijaya’s brother, who had removed ‘Congress’ from his Twitter bio yesterday. The number of districts in MP has now gone up to 55.

The government explained that creating new districts will speed up development work in these places, but in the middle of the political turmoil it is being seen as a move to placate MLAs.

Tripathi, who has repeatedly defied the party line and said that the Nath government is safe, has long been demanding that Maihar — so long in Satna district — be made a district. Laxman Singh has been campaigning for the same for his constituency, Chachoda, in Guna, and even sat on dharna at the residence of his brother, Digvijaya, in October last year to place this demand.

Similarly, there was long-pending demand from local leaders to carve Nagda as a district from Ujjain. On Wednesday, Dilip Singh Gurjar , the local MLA, was with law minister P C Sharma when he met the Press to announce the cabinet decisions.

Free govt guarantee of Rs 26,000 crore to Civil Supplies Corporation: The cabinet approved free government guarantee of Rs 26,000 crore for 2020-21 fiscal to Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation for procurement of foodgrains under decentralized procurement scheme, operation of PDS and other government schemes. It was also decided that RBI’s food credit limit, which has a higher rate of interest, would be obtained if a higher amount is required for procurement.

Extension of Tenures: The cabinet, in keeping with a Supreme Court order in connection with the Sardar Sarovar Project, decided to extend the contractual appointment of retired high court judge Shambhu Singh, Syed Ali Naqvi, IS Shrivastava, SL Jain and SS Dwivedi from April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021.

The SC had in 2018 said health will have to be given precedence and asked the automobile industry to show the “will, responsibility and urgency” to adopt cleaner BS-VI fuel.

322,['19/03/2020'],Polish student can stay in India: Calcutta High Court,"Calcutta High Court

KOLKATA: Polish student Kamil Siedcynski will not have to leave India, at least for the moment. The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday set aside the ‘leave-India’ notice issued to Siedcynski by the Foreign Residents’ Registration Office ( FRRO ) for being present in an anti-CAA rally with other students of Jadavpur University on December 19.

Siedcynski had moved the court against this order, stating that his version was not heard by the FRRO and that the Constitution grants him certain rights.

The Union of India had contended that the Constitution doesn’t grant rights to protest against the government to foreigners and submitted a confidential report stating how the Polish student had participated in other anti-government protests.

Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya, after hearing both sides, dismissed the confidential report for not containing any valid ground for expulsion of the student from India. The court also held that some Articles of the Constitution do not discriminate between Indians and foreigners residing in the country legally. “In a democratic country like India, the rights of any authority cannot be totally arbitrary and unrestricted. The fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution govern not only Indian citizens but foreigners as well, so long as they are on Indian soil,” the court observed.

According to Justice Bhattacharyya, all submissions made by the government regarding its sole right to decide on such issues pertain to illegal immigrants or foreigners whose visas have expired. He observed that this right cannot be used against somebody whom the government has not only issued a visa but also renewed it subsequently.

“The visa confers valuable rights on the petitioner, not merely to stay in India but also associated rights, which are assured by the Constitution to both citizens and foreigners…..For a brilliant student of the academic standard of the petitioner, it is but natural that he shall have free interactions in an atmosphere of freedom with Indians, at least while in India. Such liberties, as guaranteed by the Constitution….are basic rights inherent in human existence,” the court said.

The contention by the government that Siedcynski was heard at the FRRO was also shot down by Justice Bhattacharyya. The right of hearing was granted after issuance of the ‘Leave India’ notice, which makes it a mere ‘lip-service and eye-wash’, he observed.

Former Union minister, P Ashok Gajapathi Raju, moved the high court challenging the GOs issued by the state government recognising Sanchaitha and her sister Urmila Gajapathi Raju as founder family members of the MANSAS Trust and Sanchaitha’s appointment as chairman of the Trust. On the other hand, Ashok Gajapathi Raju’s sister RV Sunitha Prasad challenged the GO issued appointing Sanchaitha as chairman of the Simhachalam temple trust board.

Arguing on behalf of Ashok Gajapathi Raju, senior counsel M Vidya Sagar argued that the three GOs issued by the state government are in violation of Deed of Trust executed in 1958. He argued that according to the Deed, only male successors are to be made the chairman of the MANSAS Trust. He said Anand Gajapathi Raju, the elder brother of Ashok Gajapathi Raju continued as chairman and after Ashok Gajapathi Raju continuing as the chairman after demise of his brother.

Sunitha Prasad also contended on the same grounds that according to the by-laws of the Temple Trust, only male children from the family are to be made as successors and appointment of Sanchaitha is illegal and in violation of Trust Deed executed by her father PVG Raju.

Taking the arguments into consideration, the high court issued notices to the principal secretary revenue (endowments) department and other respondents. Further hearing on the matter has been posted to March 24.

The buyers, mostly traders, come from across the country to buy the raisins here. The auctions take place in two major markets — Sangli and Tasgaon. The raisin produced in south Maharashtra, mainly in Sangli and Solapur districts, are bought to the markets where every licenced shop holds auctions.Rajendra Kumbhar, the president of the Sangli district raisin association, said, “We have cancelled the auctions. The traders come from the big cities — some of which have had positive coronavirus cases. They may bring the virus with them. As of now, we have cancelled the auctioning in both the markets till March 31. If the condition improves, we will restart the auctions.”The grape farmers are facing the brunt of the auction cancellation. They can get money for their produce only after the auction. At present, only 50% of the raisins have been auctioned. The farmers are now in a dilemma about whether to go make more raisins or sell the grapes in the market. The farmers have to put their raisins in the cold storage facilities and they have to pay for the facility. Kumbhar said that the storages have adequate capacity to accommodate most of the raisins produced.Vilas Mane, a raisin producer from Nagaj in Kavathe Mahankal tehsil of Sangli district, has harvested the grapes and started processing them make raisins. “If the decision to cancel auctions was taken a few days ago, I would have sold the grapes.

He shared the video with the caption, “Look so forward to being with my great friends in INDIA!”.

While many saw the US president’s gesture as a curtain-raiser to his India trip, others felt this was his attempt to create a greater connection with Indian-Americans, especially Telugus, in an election year.

Analysts have been speaking about the potential of the Indian-American community in the US. In fact, student group North American Association of Indian Students (NAAIS) has recently started a #DesiVote campaign to get unregistered Indian-Americans to exercise their franchise.

NAAIS claims there are over two million unregistered Indian-American voters. Breaking down the number, Sudhanshu Kaushik, founder, NAAIS, said, “We found that there were about 4.5 million Indian-Americans in US in 2016, out of which 3.5 million people were above 18 years old. In 2018, 800,000 Indian-Americans came out to vote for the mid-term elections. Even if we round that figure to a million, it means there are definitely over two million voters who did not vote.”

The focus of the #DesiVote campaign are these eligible voters, said Kaushik, adding that while Indian-Americans play a huge role in the economic and social spheres in the US are, “Politically underepresented and at the same time are not going out to make our voices heard.”

Also speaking of the great demographic profile, Chinmayi Balusu, a NAAIS member, said, “I wanted to join the effort to mobilise Indian-Americans to register to vote. This would be the first step to exercising their political power.” As a first-time voter herself, she said the initiative would aim to help people find the resources to register.

Meanwhile, several India-Americans agreed they would like to see the community play a more proactive role. “We contribute majorly towards taxes and are educated, law abiding citizens. Better representation for us would mean better politics in the US,” said Suresh K, a resident of Dallas. Ramesh Reddy, from New Jersey, said he did not vote in the last presidential elections, but will this time. “I think every vote matters,” he said.

VIJAYAWADA: Panchayat Raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy on Wednesday strongly opposed the appointment of IAS officer Siddharth Jain as election observer for Chittoor district.

“Election commissioner Ramesh Kumar has posted an officer, who worked as a shadow to former chief minister and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu in the past, as observer for Chittoor district. Ramesh Kumar and Naidu have been friends since their college days, and have now joined hands. Naidu put the state in a debt trap. Now, the state is going to face a loss of Rs 5,000 crore,” he alleged.

The contention that elections were postponed in West Bengal and Maharashtra stands no ground as no notification was issued in those states, he said. “But in AP, election notification was issued, nominations have been filed and when the elections were due for completion in 10 days, they are postponed all of a sudden,” Peddireddy added.

Meanwhile, Naidu welcomed the SC’s decision on postponing of local body polls in AP. “Coronavirus has created panic across the country and the top court has rightly upheld the decision of the SEC in postponing local body polls in the state,” Naidu said.

KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation ( KMC ) has accepted the request of the people in suburban areas for changing the water supply timing back to the morning hours.

Earlier, as per request of the locals from areas like Salokhenagar, Raigad Colony, More Mane Nagar, Bhavani Society , Kalamba Jail area and Katyayani Complex area, the supply timing was changed to the afternoon slot.

The locals had claimed that the elevated storage tank located at Salokhenagar could not be filled even to half of its capacity in the morning owing to which both supply and pressure were inadequate. Hence, the civic body decided to change the supply timing.

A senior KMC official said, “From March 6, we started supplying water in the afternoon for four hours. The locals are now complaining that they are mostly out at work and could not store water. Thus, we have decided to start supplying water in the morning hours from Thursday.”

He added, “Most of the families in these areas are working class people. Thus, being at home during the later afternoon hours was difficult for most of them.”

Santosh Jadhav, a resident of Salokhenagar, said, “The water supply started in the afternoon and continued till 5pm. This was done to ensure the high rise tank is filled properly so that we get supply at adequate pressure. However, many families are not available during the supply hours to store water. Therefore, we requested the KMC to change the supply timing. Supply for just two hours with adequate pressure is enough for us.”

With the onset of summer, the demand for water is growing. The suburban areas depend on the Shingnapur supply scheme which is old and the pumping capacity has been inadequate for current demand.

Keeping this in mind, the civic body has undertaken the work to repair valves, leakages to the pipelines to improve the supply condition.

Some employees who came in direct contact with the bureaucrat were sent to home isolation and have been asked to get tests done.The process of sanitization started in the morning with the chief minister’s room on the 14th floor. Four PWD teams worked in tandem through the day. The fifth-floor office of the bureaucrat whose son has tested Covid-19 positive has been sanitized and sealed. Though Nabanna officials termed the sanitization process as a ‘routine work’, top-level sources said the administration didn’t want to take any chance.“On Monday, the patient’s bureaucrat mother came to the office and held several meetings. So there is every possibility that if she has developed any kind infection from his son, it might spread further. So we are not taking any chance,” a senior PWD official said. However, PWD officials feel the process of fumigation can be done only in an empty building but that is not possible now. “We have done this temporarily and we will fumigate the entire building on a holiday,” an official added.The bureaucrat’s son testing positive has had a ripple effect among the employees of the state secretariat. Even chief minister Mamata Banerjee spoke on the “irresponsible behaviour”. “I do not support this. Why would a person, who has come from London, not go for a test? I cannot ignore anything because I am influential. Those who are coming from outside should maintain the basic protocol laid down by the health department. They should not go to malls or visit any other crowded place,” the chief minister said in a programme on Wednesday.The incident, however, has raised concerns among the employees of the department. “I went to the library and touched many books. She had also gone the library. I have been asked to go for home isolation. I don’t know what is going to happen,” an employee who works in the same department said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74711522,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-72806,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nabanna-sanitized-after-one-detected-with-corona-virus/articleshow/74699543.cms

KOLHAPUR: City police have invoked the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act ( MCOCA ) against an 11-member gang that was involved in smuggling gutka from the neighbouring Karnataka state to Maharashtra.

According to police, it is the first such action under MCOCA against a gang involved in smuggling gutka. The gang is led by Mahesh Dalvi and is called MD gang.

The gang members have been booked in more than 21 criminal cases with several police stations in Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts. Police have invoked MCOCA against the gang for kidnapping and murdering a man to recover gutka from him.

On January 18, three people were carrying 144 bags of gutka from Tumkur to Athani in Karnataka by a truck. When they reached Athani, 53 bags were missing from the vehicle.

The truck owner contacted the MD gang to recover the stolen gutka from the trio. Following this, the trio was abducted by the gang members and was tortured which led to the death of one of them.

A police team got information from sources about the gang trying to dispose a body. The team swung into action and in no time 11 members of the gang were arrested. They were booked under several sections of the IPC at Jaysingpur police station.

“Following the incident we gathered information about the gang members and prepared a proposal to invoke MCOCA against the gang. The gang members were found involved in smuggling gutka from Karnataka to Maharashtra along with series of other crimes like murder, attempt to murder and extortion. A proposal was sent to the IG office for approval. We recently received the information from the IG office that our proposal to invoke MCOCA against the gang was accepted,” a senior police officer attached with SP office said.

On the basis of the disclosure, it will make a separate list of residents at risk and will submit it to the state government.“We have come across a few residents who had visited the patient’s home after he had returned from the UK. We have informed the state health department about them and are also asking the residents to get themselves tested and stay in home isolation for the next few weeks,” said the association secretary.On the list of “residents at risk” based on their travel history, the secretary said: “We have learnt from the example that people are not following home isolation advisory and hence we have pleaded to all the apartment owners to disclose details of those who have returned from virus-affected nations in the last few weeks and if anyone is scheduled to come from abroad in the next few days. Once the list is ready, we will submit it to the state government,” said the secretary.A meeting of the board of managers of the residents’ association was held at the complex at 11pm on Tuesday to decide on “emergency measures” that need to be taken.

348,['19/03/2020'],Actor booked in Rs 97 lakh duping case in Pune,"Actor Vikram Gokhale

PUNE: The Paud police are investigating a case lodged by a Kothrud resident accusing actor Vikram Gokhale and two others of cheating 14 investors of Rs 96.99 lakh in a plot scheme spread across Dongargaon and Hotale villages in Mulshi taluka as a part of the “Girivan” private hill station project.

In his FIR lodged on Tuesday afternoon, complainant Jayant Bahirat (57), an artist, named Gokhale as the chairman, and social worker Jayant Rambhau Mhalgi and his wife Sujata Jayant Mhalgi as directors of the Sujata Farms Private Limited, which floated the hill station project in 1989. He alleged that the three office-bearers of the firm misrepresented the scheme as “government approved” and misused the goodwill as well as their relationship with late former MP Rambhau Mhalgi to lure investors.

The FIR stated that after collecting money, the firm failed to get the plots demarcated by the state land measurement officials. When the investors secured an order from the land measurement department in 2016, they were restrained from getting the land measurement done, it read.

Gokhale said, “I was the director and the face of the company. I tendered my resignation on January 9 and I am not related to the project as of now. Despite this, my name has been dragged in the FIR.”

Gokhale said, “The company has handed over 958 plots in the scheme without any trouble. People mentioned in the FIR have also got their plots, but there are some issues with their measurement. This issue can be sorted out once the government-appointed team measures the land. It is not the case that they have not received their plots. All the documents and agreements have been processed clearly.”

Jayant Mhalgi could not be contacted despite repeated calls on his cell phone number. A text message too was sent on his number seeking his reaction, but there was no response till going to the press.

Complainant Bahirat alleged in the FIR that Gokhale and others won confidence of people and encouraged them to invest in the project. Considering the involvement of Gokhale and the other two directors, people trusted them and invested money, he said.

Despite the bookings and execution of legal documents of the plots, the company committed discrepancies in the allotment of plots other than the survey number of plots assured to each of the affected investor and restrained the investors from getting the land measured, the FIR stated.

One of the affected investors said, “We were fighting the matter for the past five years.”

Paud police inspector Ashok Dhumal said, “The case is more about discrepancies in allotment of plots and technical issues involving measurement of land. We shall investigate all angles before taking a call on whether to arrest those named in the FIR or not.”

351,['19/03/2020'],Covid-19: Treatment for Hyderabad boy with Chapel syndrome hits roadblock,"HYDERABAD: An eight-year-old boy from the city, the only known case of the rare Chapel Syndrome in India, was to travel to US to participate in a clinical trial for a drug being tested by the National Institute of Health (NIH), but with travel restrictions owing to Covid-19, his treatment has hit a roadblock.Chapel syndrome which is a genetic disease in which the CD 55 gene is missing in patients, meanwhile causes an extreme shortage of protein in the body. Patients also continue to lose protein through stools and have life threatening complications.Condition of the boy, Ayan, has worsened in the last few weeks and doctors are waiting for his health to stabilise.The doctor treating him has written to the institute to allow treating him in Hyderabad by supplying the drug locally. “With restrictions imposed due to Covid-19, the process has run into delays. The US-based institute is now trying to arrange for a health insurance of the patient as well as his family members, as travelling during the ongoing pandemic can expose them to the virus and they might require hospitalisation. While these things are taking time, Ayan’s condition has deteriorated. We have sought permission from the institute to allow us to carry out research here by enrolling our centre in the trial group and we will share the results with them,” said Dr Prashanth Bachina, paediatric gastroenterologist.For that to happen, an approval from the Drugs Approval Committee of India and permission from Drug Controller General of India is needed.Meanwhile, Ayan is on a daily dose of injections for hypoalbuminia and it is being administered 2-3 times a week. “We are told that it will take at least three months before he is stable and can be sent for further treatment. Since his treatment is not available here, doctors at AIIMS had contacted many institutes. While researchers from Turkey and Bangkok had initially wanted to take him as a research subject, but they later refused. Now our only hope is the US institute. We have exhausted all our monetary reserves and the little which came from crowd-funding. Each day is a challenge for us now,” said Ayan’s father Md Tajuddin, who is a postman.While Rs 2 lakh raised through crowd-funding sustained his treatment for a few months, the family is banking on crowd-funding once again for his treatment in Hyderabad till he is stable enough to be sent to US or approved for clinical trial in India. The estimated expense is between Rs 1.2 crore to Rs 6 crore depending on the response to the drug.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74703424,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-173773,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/treatment-for-boy-with-chapel-syndrome-hits-roadblock/articleshow/74700708.cms

353,['19/03/2020'],Trial run on delay-ridden Kanaka Durga flyover project from April 15,"Vijayawada: The Kanaka Durga flyover project is likely to miss the deadline once again. Krishna district administration, which has been working hard to complete the project works by the end of March, has now proposed to extend the deadline to April 15.

Kanaka Durga flyover is one of the prestigious projects in the city. The project work, which started way back in November 2015 with a deadline of December 2016, failed to get shape even after four years.

Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy had a special focus on the project after he assumed charge as CM and directed officials to complete the project by December 31, 2019. Endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivas said that the state government would give the project as a new year gift to the citizens.

But the project got delayed with a series of interruptions caused by Dasara celebrations and Bhavani Deeksha Viramana.

District collector A Mohammed Imtiaz, who also had a special focus on the project, had conducted a series of reviews with the agency and NHAI authorities. Officials decided to conduct a trial run from the first week of April and postponed the proposal with a delay in the works.

“We are committed to the completion of works by March 31. Around 90 percent of project work has been completed till date. Out of the 2.5-kilometer-long blacktop road, 1.5 kilometers have been completed. We hope the remaining work will be completed soon so we can start the trial run,” Imtiaz said.

However contracting agency, SOMA said that they would complete the works by April 15.

Meanwhile, citizens are unhappy over the delay. “We have been waiting for this flyover for the past three years. Officials should complete the work to ease up traffic in the city,” said G Kartheek Kumar, a resident of Vidhyadharapura.

354,['19/03/2020'],Uttar Pradesh: Cage with bait placed at rubber factory to trap tigress,"BAREILLY: A day after the photo of a tigress was captured in the defunct rubber factory campus, 18 km from Bareilly city, forest department placed a cage with a bait to trap it.

The tigress is said to have made the factory its den for the last 10 days. While the presence of a tiger was confirmed on Monday, close examination of its pugmarks showed the big cat is a tigress.

A team of experts visited the site on Tuesday evening to plan the rescue operation.

Chief conservator of forests, Rohilkhand zone, Lalit Verma told TOI, “We conducted a recce of the rubber factory and could smell the tigress -- which means it has marked its territory. But we could not spot it. Though a cage with a bait has been placed on rubber factory campus, we will soon be placing four more cages to trap the animal. Besides, we will increase the number of camera traps from five to 25 to ascertain its location. Once located, we will tranquilize the tigress.”

However, forest officials said tranquilizing the tigress at the rubber factory is tough and the operation could stretch to months. “Due to the presence of old trenches, tunnels, tanks and other equipment in the abandoned rubber factory, it is risky to dart the animal. We will try to lure the tigress outside to tranquilize it,” said Verma.

Divisional forest officer Bharat Lal said, “We have arranged meat which was half consumed by a male tiger. This half-eaten meat will be placed around the camera traps to attract the tigress to get an idea about its location and movement.”

A team of veterinarian and experts from WWF-India have reached Bareilly to assist the forest department in the rescue operation. A team from WTI is expected to reach here on Wednesday.

HYDERABAD: In a shocking ordeal which came to light in Kamatipura in Old City, two minor girls were being allegedly raped by five persons for the last one year. Kamatipura police on Wednesday said the accused, including three minor boys, were arrested and booked on the charges of rape and under sections of POCSO Act. The girls are siblings. The accused also belong to the same area.

“In the last one year, each one of the five accused took the elder girl (17) to various places and raped her. One of the two adults raped her younger sister (14) also,’’ Kamatipura inspector G Rambabu told TOI. Police said the sisters faced the ordeal multiple times. The accused took the sisters to either a burial ground or an underconstruction building site in Kamatipura where they forced themselves on the hapless sisters.

The elder girl is a class IX student. She was befriended by a minor boy, a class VIII student. Police said they went to the same tuition class. “He lured her and said he loved her. He later raped her at the burial ground. After some days, he introduced her to other accused, who are his friends,” police said.

Police said the accused boy even threatened the elder girl with dire consequences if she disclosed the matter to her family members. The sisters are under the care of their uncle, who grew suspicious when the elder girl came home late on Monday. “When she was questioned, she told her uncle about the ordeal she and her sister have been facing at the hands of the accused. All the offenders are known to the two girls,” police said.

Based on a complaint from the family, the accused were nabbed on Tuesday. The two adults were arrested and produced before a magistrate, while the three minors were produced before a juvenile court.

Police registered a case under Section-376 (rape) of IPC and under various sections of the POCSO Act.

KOLKATA: Exactly a week after a 17-year-old student went missing from his hostel in Jorasanko under mysterious circumstances, the central division police officers said they had traced him near Varanasi in UP .

Sushanta Chowdhury, a student of Abhinav Bidyabharati School , who hailed from Bhagalpur in Bihar and was staying in a student hostel on Ratu Sarkar Lane in Jorasanko, had appeared for three of his CBSE Class-XII board papers before he went missing.

“A team has left for UP. We hope to bring him back at the earliest. So far, we have not found any foul play or any outside instigation behind his disappearance,” said a police officer.

Police said a missing case had been lodged with the Jorasanko police station earlier. However, cops were yet to get any lead to trace him. His family denied having received any ransom call so far.

According to police, Chowdhury had left the hostel on March 11 in the evening. The CCTV footage showed that he was wearing informal clothes and walking towards Kolutolla. Cops said the teenager carried some money with him but left his two mobile phones behind.

The teenager told his family that his exams were good and that he would return his Bihar home on March. He also claimed to have already booked a train ticket.

The hostel administration approached the police on March 12, after which a missing complaint was registered.

Other students staying in the hostel told cops that he had played Holi on March 10 with them and was to write his economics paper just a couple of days later. “His father has informed us that he had been speaking normally with them and showed no anxiety about the exams. We started speaking to his friends and relatives to find his whereabouts,” said a police officer.

362,['19/03/2020'],Uttar Pradesh- Honey bee buzz keeps animals off Haridwar-Doon tracks,"BAREILLY: A buzz of a honey bee played on loudspeakers has helped curb collision between trains and animals on the the Haridwar-Dehradun railway track that passes through Rajaji National Park for the past two years, say Moradabad Railway Division officials.

The sound system installed near the railway tracks amplifies the recorded sound of honey bees that drives animals away from the tracks when trains approach, thereby preventing them from being run over. The Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) has the system in place across four of its divisions at select crossings where elephant zones exist.

At least four elephants were mowed down by trains in separate incidents in Uttarakhand in 2018 as they failed to move away quickly out of the way of an approaching train. The buzzing sound of bees is audible to an elephant 600 meters away and is played for a few minutes before the train arrives so any elephant nearby changes its route “sensing the presence of beesaround”.

Speaking with TOI, Moradabad divisional railway manager (DRM) Tarun Prakash said, “The system has proved to be a success as no incident of collision between train and animals has occurred in the last two years. The idea was worked upon jointly by the railways and forest department and implemented around two years ago to keep animal off the railway track. The loudspeakers that have been installed at select railway crossings where animal zones exist play the buzzing sound of honey bees. It distracts wild animals, especially elephants, making them move away from the railway tracks. This way, animals do not die while crossing the tracks.”

The DRM added, “Other measures such as electric fences, temporary speed restrictions are also used to keep the animals at bay. Besides, real time updates are also shared by forest officials who alert the loco pilot in real time basis in case elephants are spotted. This further ensures that animals are not run over by trains.”

Besides, with the rise in temperature in the next month, the cases of H1N1 will be minimised.”“As the symptoms of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) and swine flu are similar, doctors should check if the patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome or not. If the patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome, but has no travel history and did not come in contact with the infected person, then swine flu cannot be ruled out,” he added.In 2019, 65 people tested positive and three succumbed to the H1N1 virus in Bareilly division . Of these, 60, including the three deaths, were reported from Bareilly district , four from Shahjahanpur district and one from Budaun.In 2018, Bareilly district had reported only a single case of swine flu while 54 were tested positive in 2017.Experts said H1N1 virus is an air-borne contagious disease and spreads through the air droplets produced by sneezing, coughing, or by direct contact with saliva or mucus secretions.",bareilly,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/two-fresh-cases-of-swine-flu-detected-in-bareilly/articleshow/74693716.cms
368,['19/03/2020'],Uttar Pradesh: PTR to maintain data of stray tigers with help of mobile app,"PILIBHIT: Pilibhit Tiger Reserve authorities have decided to maintain a data of tigers that stray into the eco-sensitive zone of the forest through a mobile app. This app will be the first of its kind in the state.

There are 276 villages in the eco-sensitive zone and of these, 176 have been declared as “sensitive”. From time to time, tigers stray into these villages. Now, if spotted, the information about the big cat will be relayed to the forest officials by “bagh mitras”, who have been selected for the purpose. Each of the bagh mitras will have the app on his mobile for the purpose.

The app will show the GPS coordinates, the photos and the brief description of the big cat spotted along with mobile phone numbers of forest personnel ranging from the forest guard up to the deputy director— all of which will be available on a single click. The information will then be compiled in PTR ’s data base online along with maps concerned.

Till now, PTR authorities had little or no information about tigers that stray out of the forest, said deputy director Naveen Khandelwal.

He said, “The app will be downloaded on the mobiles of some 12 bagh mitras in each of the 176 villages declared as sensitive in the eco sensitive zone of PTR. Each bagh mitra will transfer the information of any tiger straying into their area with specific details through the mobile app to the forest staff concerned.”

Once they get the information, the field forest personnel will immediately rush to the spot and verify the authenticity of the information. If they assess the situation as “alarming”, they will immediately inform higher officials to receive assistance of a rescue team.

The action taken on ground zero in response to bagh mitra’s information will regularly be examined by the SDOs and the deputy director, Khandelwal added.

“This information will be compiled and analyzed at PTR headquarters on a weekly basis and it will also help identifying the most affected areas in vicinity of forest and to study the reasons for the tiger to stray there,” the deputy director explained.

The bagh mitra and field forest force will be trained to use app, he added.

PILIBHIT: The police on Tuesday morning booked two wholesalers of fruits for extorting over Rs 45 lakh from a trader based in Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi.

The accused owed the victim a large amount towards fruits supplied to them over the past five years. When the trader reached Pilibhit to demand his outstanding payment, the wholesalers abused him and threatened him with murder.

The victim, Ravi Kumar, who lives in Gur Mandi under Model Town police station in Delhi, filed a written complaint at Sungarhi police station late night on Monday, alleging that he had trade dealings with Anwar Hussain and company, of the agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC) campus in Pilibhit.

Partners Aftab Hussain and Guddu began taking supplies of fruits from him many years ago, but stopped paying since 2015. After every reminder, Kumar said they kept reassuring him they would clear all dues with the next consignment. Gradually, their arrears accumulated to the tune of Rs 45.6 lakh.

Unable to rely on their word any more, when Kumar reached Pilibhit and demanded payment of his dues, he was abused by the two accused and threatened with murder.

Sungarhi SHO Atar Singh said an FIR was lodged against both accused under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 386 (extortion).

PUNE: A magisterial court in Pune cantonment on Wednesday rejected the bail applications of Dheeraj Sabale (26) and Mandar Waykar (41), arrested recently in the Rs50-lakh extortion case, which also involves gangster Chhota Rajan ’s niece Priyadashini Nikalje , who is on the run.

Judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) Komal Singh Rajput said in an order, “It is not in the interest of justice to release the accused at this point of time on bail.”

The magistrate observed, “If we consider the record, it is noticed that accused persons were actively involved in the alleged act. One of them (Sabale) was caught red-handed while accepting money. One of the main accused (Nikalje) is still absconding and investigation is in progress. The nature of offence and from the involvement of the persons in it, the possibility of tampering and other adverse aspects cannot be ruled out.”

Earlier, the city crime branch officials produced Sabale and Waykar before JMFC Rajput at the end of the duo’s custodial remand and prosecutor Angela Navgire , assisted by complainant’s lawyer Milind Pawar , moved a plea for further extension of custodial remand. The magistrate, however, observed that sufficient remand had been given to the police and directed the two accused to be sent to the Yerawada jail under magisterial custody.

Soon after, the two accused moved their bail pleas, contending that investigation against them stood completed and, that, they had been falsely dragged in the matter. Both, the prosecutor and the investigating officer, objected to the grant of bail, arguing that the offence was serious, and the investigation was in progress. One of the accused is still absconding and, hence, the bail pleas be rejected.

Sabale, Waykar and Nikalje are facing charges of threatening a 48-year-old Katraj-based developer at gunpoint and demanding Rs50 lakh from him.

The Barelvi clerics, who had gathered at Dargah Aala Hazrat, said they will appeal to the Imams of mosques to give the boycott call if their concerns are not addressed by the government.

Amid apprehensions from a section of population that some of them will be declared “outsiders” if they are not able to furnish documents proving their nationality, Union home minister Amit Shah has told Parliament earlier this month that people will not have to submit citizenship documents under the NPR exercise.

Amid “confusion” over the National Population Register (NPR), BJP’s ally and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has said that the 2020 format has several “controversial” clauses. The Bihar assembly also recently passed a resolution saying that the NPR will be implemented according to the 2011 format.

Parts of the country were recently embroiled in large-scale protests against Constitutional (Amendment) Act (CAA) and also the NPR. Most of the protesters were from the minority community.

On Tuesday, a meeting of the Barelvi clerics led by Mufti Asjad Raza Khan, also voiced their concerns about the proposed format of NPR.

National vice-president of Jamat Raza-e-Mustafa, an organisation affiliated to Dargah Aala Hazrat, Salman Hasan Khan said, “The population census should be carried out in the same way as was done in 2011. Muslims should not be afraid of NPR as dargah will stand by them. If anyone comes to your house for survey, talk to him in polite manner but there is no need to share any document with him. We will appeal to Imams of mosques to inform public about boycotting NPR during Friday prayers.”

MUMBAI: Testing capacity for Covid-19 will double from 150 to 300 in the city on Thursday, with authorities making arrangements for tests at KEM Hospital and Haffkine Institute, apart from Kasturba Hospital’s molecular laboratory at present.

The capacity will jump to 1,000 Covid-19 tests a day within a few days if the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) gives permission to more government as well as private laboratories. The WHO has recommended scaling up testing facilities in India to confirm the extent of the virus’s spread. India is currently testing barely

BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said Kasturba and KEM hospitals would jointly test around 300 samples a day. KEM on Wednesday tested samples which were reconfirmed by the National Institute of Virology, Pune, and the results were found to be definitive, the BMC said. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said KEM will start testing swab samples from Thursday. “They will share Kasturba’s load that has been single-handedly testing samples from Mumbai and MMR,” he said. KEM may be able to handle 150-200 samples a day.

On Wednesday, Pardesi held discussions with private labs and hospitals, including Metropolis, SRL, Thyrocare and Hinduja Hospital laboratory, for testing facilities. The BMC has asked these laboratories to share their details with ICMR to get the mandatory permission to conduct tests. “Once they get the permission, they can also conduct around 1,000 tests a day,” said Pardeshi.

Meanwhile, earlier in the day, state health minister Rajesh Tope visited NIV in Pune and said eight new laboratories, including at Pune’s B J Medical College, would be allowed to conduct tests for Covid-19. The Centre will provide 10 lakh more kits for Covid-19 testing, he added.

Currently, the infrastructure at Kasturba allows for 150 samples to be tested daily.

The BMC is now ramping up the facility and will add new equipment that will allow 250 samples to be tested daily from Friday, said civic officials. “Kasturba laboratory currently has six trained personnel to conduct the tests. The BMC is now recruiting more professionals for the increased number of tests,” said BMC officials.

The state-run Sir J J Hospital, Byculla, which has a state of the art molecular laboratory to test for tuberculosis, will also provide Covid-19 testing facilities.

At Haffkine Institute, said Tope, two new laboratories will be added in the coming four days.

NIV will provide equipment in Dhule, Aurangabad and Solapur to set up Covid-19 testing laboratories. BMC officials said Aurangabad corporation has reached out to the BMC to train its personnel to conduct tests.

“The state is ready with 700 ventilators and 600 isolation beds. It is mandatory for all private hospitals to provide isolation beds,” said Tope.

He added NIV is networked with over 50-60 laboratories around the country. (Inputs by Sumitra Deb Roy)

PUNE: A sessions court on Wednesday convicted and sentenced a 35-year-old man to life imprisonment for murdering his wife by setting her ablaze on May 1, 2014, in their fifth-floor flat at Utkarsha Society in Katraj.

Accused Vikas Kumar Suraj Bhan Kumar , lodged in the Yerawada jail, was produced before additional sessions judge GP Agrawal in a videoconference proceeding for the sentencing after he was convicted for murder.

“Due to Covid-19 virus, the Director General of Police has directed all district/central prisons to produce undertrial prisoners through videoconferencing . Accused is produced through videoconferencing. He is informed that charge under section 302 (murder) of IPC is proved against him and asked him what he wants to submit on point of sentence,” the judgment read.

Additional public prosecutor Sunil More told TOI, “Kumar was working with a builder who had given him a fifth-floor room in a building adjacent to his office for living. The accused would often suspect the character of his wife and beat her under the influence of liquor.”

“Around 8am on May 1, 2014, the accused set his wife ablaze following a quarrel. The burning victim ran out of the house and to the fourth-floor flat of a couple before collapsing there, shouting for help. She was shifted to a private hospital in Katraj and subsequently to the Sassoon hospital ,” More said.

Around 2pm, the same day, Anita recorded her dying declaration before investigating officer API SH Shaikh in the presence of Prasanna Nair , member of a Mahila Dakshata Samiti. The same was converted into an FIR. More examined total eight witnesses in support of the prosecution’s case.

The judge relied on evidence recorded by the couple as well as the conduct of the accused, who egged them on to let her die instead of saving her. The court cited Section 8 of the Indian Evidence Act referring to the previous and subsequent conduct of the accused to establish his criminal intent that was corroborated by the couple’s evidence.

The commission has released a schedule of hearings from March 30 to April 4 to be held in Mumbai. Apart from Pawar, who is to depose on the last day, the commission has summoned then Pune district collector Saurabh Rao, then additional commissioner of police Ravindra Sengaonkar , then superintendent of Pune rural police Mohammad Suvez Haq and then Baramati division’s additional superintendent of police Sandip Pakhale for deposition.

On February 20, rightist think-tank member Sagar Shinde had filed an affidavit urging the commission to summon Pawar for providing additional information the latter might have regarding the caste riots. Both, Shinde and Pawar, filed affidavits in the past as witness before the commission comprising Justice (retd) Jainarayan Patel and former top bureaucrat Sumit Mullick .

On February 11, the newly formed Maha Vikas Aghadi government gave a “final” two-month extension to the commission — set up in February 2018 by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government to look into the sequence of events leading to the riots — to complete the proceeding and submit a final report by April 8.

It is Shinde’s case that the statements made by Pawar on February 18 at a press conference in Mumbai on the Pune police’s probe into the Elgar Parishad case indicated a contradictory position vis-à-vis what the NCP chief mentioned in his affidavit filed on October 8, 2018, before the commission. As such, Pawar may have some additional information to provide to the commission.

The NCP’s spokesperson and state minority development minister Nawab Malik said in a release on Wednesday, “Pawar will depose before the commission on April 4 as per the date of availability he had conveyed to the panel. Our party has always maintained that the caste riots at Koregaon Bhima were pre-planned and that is the reason why Pawar stated his stance through an affidavit filed earlier.”

Ganga Seva Nidhi member Dr V K Singh said, “It has been decided to continue the tradition of the daily aarti, but the number of archaks (priests) has been reduced to one.” Haridwar district magistrate C Ravishankar said the restrictions will be imposed at Har-ko-Pauri from Thursday and will be in effect till March 31. “With the beginning of navaratras on March 25, live streaming of the aarti will commence so that devotees can take part in the ritual virtually,” he told TOI.Office bearers of Ganga Sabha , a religious organization, who participated in a meeting with the district administration on Wednesday had opposed the idea of restricting the pilgrims and instead proposed that about 1000 masks can be distributed at the aarti every day and the ghat can be sanitised.

He added that they were caught off-guard by the Indian government’s decision to ban incoming flights and have now been left in the lurch.Bhardwaj said, “I arrived last night at the airport to catch my 1.30 am Air Asia flight to Delhi and was given a boarding pass. However, we were later informed that the flight has been cancelled.” Noting that the local government has declared a “state of calamity” for six months, he said, “We don’t know what to do. We did not get any satisfactory response from the airlines. There was no Indian government representative at the airport either. Many students are still at the airport due to the curfew and they can’t even travel back to their universities.”Echoing similar sentiments, another stranded student Sudarshan Patidar from Rajasthan said, “We were not given any prior notice. Nobody is able to tell us when the situation will improve or when we will be able to get out.” He also urged the Indian government to either lift the flight ban or take them back home in a special aircraft.Another medical student Geet Shankar Mazumdar from Assam’s Guwahati told TOI that the suspension of flights by the Indian government came as a huge shock to them. “They could have done this after all the students had left,” he added.Sharing videos from the Manila airport, the students said that their flight was cancelled after boarding passes were issued to them. “When we asked them to show us the official order, they refused and were very rude to all of us. They even threatened of police action if we made videos of their conversations.”Meanwhile, the Indian embassy in Manila tweeted that they are co-ordinating with the ministry of external affairs to work out a solution.

GANDHINAGAR: Every day, Amdavadis pay an average of Rs 5.87 lakh in traffic fines and in Surat city, the figure is Rs 5.83 lakh, government data shows. In reply to Vadgam independent MLA Jignesh Mevani, the state government said Rs 42.89 crore was collected in traffic fines from Ahmedabad city in last two years, and in the same period, Rs 42.62 crore was collected from Surat city.

The government also stated that in 2018 and 2019, Rs 5.66 crore in traffic fines was collected from Ahmedabad’s rural areas, and Rs 2.16 crore collected from Surat district.

A government officer said that the dense network of CCTV cameras at traffic junctions in both Ahmedabad and Surat has led to higher detection and significant collection of fines in the two cities.

The officer said that this year the figures may increase four or fivefold as traffic fine amounts have increased after the latest amendment of the Motor Vehicles Act and consequent rules passed by the state. The new fines were implemented from October 2019. Suspension of the helmet rule for over a month also reduced the amount of fines collected, the officer said. The highest amounts of traffic fines were paid by people not wearing helmets, followed by illegal parking. The third-highest amount of fines was collected from those jumping red lights, followed by those talking on phone.

397,['19/03/2020'],28 daily wage sanitary workers terminated,"NMC has around 6,000 permanent and 2,113 daily wage sanitary workers

NAGPUR: Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe on Tuesday terminated 28 daily wage sanitary workers and initiated departmental inquiry against 35 permanent sanitary workers after they were found absent from duty without intimating the health department (sanitation).

It is for the first time in the history of the NMC that such a huge number of sanitary workers have been sacked.

Confirming the news, a senior health department (sanitation) official said the terminated daily wage sanitary workers were absent from duty without informing NMC for months and escaped action.

At present, the NMC has around 6,000 permanent and 2,113 daily wage sanitary workers. Each sanitary worker is supposed to sweep 500m of road. But many of them were irregular.

TOI has reported that it is a practice at NMC, especially in health department, that employees go on leave and resume work as per their convenience citing medical reasons. But the administration took no action against such erring sanitary workers.

Since December 2017, the NMC has implemented the system to track sanitary workers through GPS-enabled wrist watches under Smart City project. The civic body pays Rs207 per month towards rental charges for each of 8,000 wrist watches for seven years. The exercise was to record their attendance . But due to opposition from sanitary workers, the ruling party halted the usage of GPS watch from August to October 2019. Though the GPS watch system was restarted from November last year, it was implemented fully after Mundhe took charge at the NMC on January 28.

Despite high-tech system in place, citizens and even corporators complain about workers’ irregular attendance and sweeping. The objective of GPS-enabled wrist watches include recording shift-wise attendance of sanitary workers, prevention and control of misuse of manual attendance system, maintenance of transparency, accountability in operations and weeding out of fake, duplicate, and false workers.

Angry over this, Mundhe ordered an inquiry at the zone level and subsequently cancelled duty cards of 28 daily wage sanitary workers. Besides, the civic chief also directed to interlink GPS-based attendance of sanitary workers with their salary slips.

In his petition, S Vaikundarajan, managing partner of V V Minerals at Tirunelveli district stated that his firm has been granted mining leases for the purpose of mining beach sand minerals under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 and Mineral Concession Rules 1960.

400,['19/03/2020'],"Madras HC asks state, Centre to give Rs 10 crore to 11 with rare disorder","Representative image

CHENNAI: Coming to the aid of people with rare disorders, including Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSD), the Madras high court on Wednesday said a welfare state should not lose faith and give up on such people.

In its interim order, the first bench of Chief Justice AP Sahi and Justice Senthil Kumar Ramamoorthy directed the Centre to allocate Rs 4.40 crore this year towards the treatment expenses of 11 people in the state affected by LSD as approximately each patient would require Rs 40 lakh a year for medical expenses. The court also directed the state government to allocate at least Rs 5 crore every year for treatment expenses of deserving patients suffering from such rare diseases.

LSD is a debilitating disorder that can be fatal. “In the hope that a person cannot be treated, one should not forget that hope itself, at times, brings about miracles and therefore, it is the duty of every responsible citizen, more so, that of a welfare state, not to lose faith or hope and continue to provide whatever assistance is possible within the means available,” the first bench said.

The court passed the order on a PIL moved by Lysosomal Storage Disorders Support Society (LSDSS) seeking financial aid from the government for such people.

Passing the orders, the bench said: “There is a perception in the state government that in view of the nature of these diseases which cannot be permanently cured, a financial aid would only help to prolong the longevity of a patient suffering from such disease. We may put on record that such a perception need not deter the government from proceeding further as we are of the firm opinion that it is difficult to exactly predict the expiry of anything from this world.”

According to petitioner, LSDs are a group of around 40 plus rare genetic disorders that’s prevalent among one in 8,000 live births. In such patients, a progressive accumulation of partially-degraded compounds in vital organs results in multiorgan malfunctioning, adversely affecting their quality of life and eventually leading to failure to thrive and death.

PUNE: The district collector on Wednesday asked 1,000 and odd permit rooms , beer bars and clubs in areas under Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits to shut shop till March 31.

In a bid to ensure social distancing against the backdrop of Covid-19 cases, the district administration passed an order to close all “on premises” liquor-serving establishments like beer bars, permit rooms (except star hotels).

While sources representing Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA) said there were around 2,400 such bars and permit rooms in PMC and PCMC limits, the excise department said there were at least a 1,000 such establishments.

The order, issued by Pune district collector and chairman of the District Disaster Management Authority Naval Kishore Ram, directed closure of all FL3 licences (sale of imported and Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) in permit rooms and restaurants — excluding star hotels), FL-4 licenses (permanent), FL-4 licenses (Temporary i.e. sale of imported liquor and IMFL at clubs) as well as on premise licenses like E (sale of beer on premises of a restaurant, club, canteen) and E-2 (sale of on premise wine) in Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation areas.

“Travellers have reached all over the country by international and domestic flights. Such travellers have also been coming to Pune district from abroad and many are on their return journey. Taking into account the possibility of further spread of Covid-19, it is imperative to take immediate control to prevent further increase in cases of the infection. We cannot rule out the possibility that Covid-19 has been transmitted in Pune district from travellers. It is thus important to maintain social distancing. Hence, the decision to shut all permit rooms and bars until March 31,” Ram said.

The order was passed based on the District Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Maharashtra Prohibition Act, 1949. Ram said.

PRAHA sources said there was confusion among restaurants in PCMC area if they would also have to stop serving food with liquor.

An official from the state excise department said, “The food can be served at these establishments.”

MADURAI: Madras high court has dismissed a plea which sought to cancel the licence issued to a company to quarry near the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) in Tirunelveli district . A division bench passed the order while hearing a plea filed by N Chendurpandi.

The judges observed that the petitioner in his petition said the authorities concerned had given quarrying licence to a private company within 2.8km radius of the Kudankulam plant and sought the licence to be cancelled.

The authorities have placed materials before the court to show that the quarry licence was given to the company in respect of the area, which is 5.98km from the plant and 2.9km from the compound wall of the site. The counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that a GO dated April 29, 1991 states that whenever any activity is to be permitted by the revenue authorities within 2 to 5km radius around the nuclear power station, permission of the project local committee should have to be obtained, whereas, in this case, such permission has not been obtained.

The judges observed that the necessity to obtain clearance from the Kudankulam Project Local Committee would arise only where the proposed activity falls within the radius of 2 to 5km and not beyond it. The judges noted that the project director of the plant sent a communication stating that there was no objection for the quarry. Citing that the petition is devoid of merits, the judges dismissed the petition.",madurai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74704932,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110797,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-cancel-licence-issued-for-quarrying-near-kknpp-dismissed/articleshow/74700843.cms

AHMEDABAD: Despite losing five MLAs ahead of the Rajya Sabha election, the Congress on Wednesday decided that it will contest both Rajya Sabha seats from Gujarat for which it has filed nominations. The Congress named Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki as its candidates for the March 26 RS poll.

The primary consideration for not withdrawing any candidate (Wednesday was the last day for withdrawing nominations) is the fact that as of now even the BJP does not have the numbers to get three candidates elected outright to the Rajya Sabha.

Importantly, the Congress has still not officially spelt out which of its two candidates will get the first 36 first preference votes of its MLAs and hence get elected automatically to the upper house. Congress leaders said that this will be decided later.

After a meeting with AICC general secretary K C Venugopal in New Delhi on Tuesday night, Gujarat Congress chief Amit Chavda maintained that there was no crisis and the Congress was ready for the election.

“The BJP has resorted to unethical means to win three seats, but the Congress has worked out a game plan to win two RS seats in Gujarat,” Chavda said.

While the BJP claims that more Congress MLAs will either resign or cross-vote, the Congress said that some BJP MLAs have been in touch with the Congress and will vote for Congress candidates

The accused was identified as Ajit Yadav of sector A Aliganj, Lucknow district. Yadav used to work in a branch of a private bank in Firozabad.

According to police, Rasoolpur-based resident Imran Khan had lodged an FIR against unknown person under IPC section 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc.), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and IT Act 66 after an amount of Rs 1,56,859 was siphoned off his account without his knowledge.

SP Firozabad Sachindra Patel said, “During his tenure as assistant manager of the private bank, Ajit Yadav changed the mobile number linked with Imran’s bank account. This helped him purchase goods worth of Rs 16,262. He wired rest of the amount into his bank with not a single transaction alert sent to victim’s phone.”

“Our team is working to find if there were more victims of cyber fraud whose money was siphoned off by Yadav,” he added.

On Wednesday, the authorities started collecting feces samples from birds. They have also taken off chicken from the diet of animals after confirmation of avian flu in Mysore.

Sources in the zoo told TOI that they supply different types of food to zoo animals, reptiles and birds depending on the diet chart prepared by experts.

The zoo, which is celebrating its 128th year, has over 1,450 different types of animals and birds.

The zoo buys mutton and chicken daily apart from grains and other food items to feed the animals and birds.

Tigers, lions, leopards and other carnivorous animals like hyena, wild dogs and wild cats are fed mutton and chicken.

The zoo procures nearly 310 to 400 kg of mutton and chicken every day through a contractor.

“The zoo has completely stopped feeding chicken to animals from Wednesday,” said executive director Ajit Kulkarni .

Meanwhile, unlike Mysuru Palace and Brindavan Gardens , which get funds for maintenance, the zoo is solely dependent on its gate collection to manage its affairs. The state government had completely stopped giving grants to Mysuru zoo in 2002. Hence the zoo is dependent on its gate collection of nearly 29 crore every year, plus another three crore from rent collection from food plazas, canteens etc. Besides, another Rs 60 lakh is collected from animal adoption scheme where the public and donors can adopt animals and birds for a year to feed the same.

The zoo, which has been closed, will be in trouble if the closure is extended for another week.

It will be difficult to maintain the zoo without support from the government in the present circumstances. The government had cancelled block grant, which forced it to look at other revenue sources like adoption of animals’ scheme.

“Initially, Mysore zoo was not suffering from any fund crunch as it has own sources of revenue from gate collection, rent collection and animal adoption scheme. The zoo, which is financially strong, is also taking care of other sister mini zoos in Chitradurga and Gadag by providing financial aid. The zoo will definitely suffer losses if closure is extended for another few days,” said Kulkarni.

HYDERABAD: Cyberabad police are working on available leads to solve the murder of a woman whose naked body was found under a culvert on Tangedupally-Vikarabad Road in Chevella town on Tuesday.

Six special teams comprising law and order and Special Operations Team (SOT) sleuths were verifying the details of the vehicles that passed through Moinabad-Vikarabad route in Rangareddy district via Tangedupally village. “The cameras at Tangedupally were removed due to road extension works. But, we have cameras on the route at Kothapally, Karmetta and Enkepally villages and we are verifying the CCTV camera footages,” said a Chevella police official.

Police found several four-wheelers, autos and mini vans carrying vegetables to the city from Vikarabad and Rangareddy districts in the CCTV camera footages. “The registration numbers were not visible due to headlight beam. We are taking the help of locals to identify the vehicles. We are also analysing the cellphone details of the murder spot to zero in on the suspects,” said a police official.

The doctors who performed the postmortem at Chevella government hospital told police that the woman was not sexually assaulted. Doctors also confirmed that the woman, who was aged around 30, had undergone caesearian and she was killed between 12 am and 5 am on Tuesday.

“There was no sexual assault. There were no strangulation marks also. After killing the victim, her body was brought to the culvert and her face was smashed with a boulder to avoid identification. It could be a case of sexual jealousy,” said an investigation officer. Gold bangles, a gold ring and a gold chain found on her body at the site indicate that she could be from a well-to-do family, police said.

As there was no reported case of missing woman that fits the woman’s profile from city Hyderabad and nearby districts, police have also alerted their counterparts in Karnataka and Maharashtra with the details of the murdered woman. Police have also sent the details of her ornaments to several jewellers for a possible identification.

MYSURU: The Karnataka State Transport Corporation has racked up losses of at least Rs 1.5 crore in March so far due to hundreds of trips cancelled daily over the coronavirus scare in its divisions in Mysuru (rural and urban), Hassan, Chikkamagalur, Mandya, Shivamogga and Chamarajanagar.

Outlining the magnitude of the problem, KSRTC authorities said on Tuesday alone, Mysuru rural cancelled 137 trips, followed by urban at 56; Shivamogga at 43; Hassan at 34; Mandya at 31; and Chikkamagaluru at 22 due to poor occupancy.

The Mysuru rural division, they said, has lost 30% of revenue so far while the urban division has lost 20%.

While passenger volume was dipping due to fears of an outbreak since the beginning of March, the curbs imposed by the state government and local administration has led to a steep decline, KSRTC officials said. Mysuru urban services, for instance, began registering a loss over the past 2-3 days.

The division lost Rs 2.3 lakh on cancellation of premium bus services on March 15 and 16 while the non-premium cancellations cost it nearly Rs 10 lakh between March 14 and 16.

The others have been bearing the brunt for longer. The rural division lost nearly Rs 78 lakh on cancellation of its premium and non-premium services between March 1 and 16.

412,['19/03/2020'],"Pune: Working remotely taxing task for many, corporates give tips","Representative image

PUNE: Shambhavi Singh has been trying hard to work from home, as advised by her office, but she faces several teething issues. Right from logistical support at home, like a good WiFi connection, to getting used to the office routine in a different environment, Singh mentioned she was also concerned about low productivity, delays in meeting targets and deadlines, among other issues. As a result, corporates have started issuing a list of tips to improve efficiency at home.

Setting goals, creating to-do lists, freshening up for work, organising the home space to turn it into a workstation, and being in touch with colleagues online are some of the tips shared to make remote working easy.

Senior officer at a financial institution Aarti Shastry said, “There are logistical challenges, especially with connectivity and data security. When the office issues a notice for remote working, the first thing I thought of was network and connectivity since I work in the finance sector. If there is an immediate requirement from a customer, I often go into a panic mode due to slow internet connectivity, access to data, etc. Of course, we escalate important calls to those still working in office, but it is not easy being at home.”

Rashmi Patil, another employee at a software firm, shared, “I am finding it very difficult to meet my target and the deliverables are getting delayed. Also, children are at home so managing them while working is taking a toll.”

Corporates are advising employees to be prepared for the regime and ensure access to proper infrastructure like laptops, wi-fi, video/audio, etc, at home. Co-founder of nutrition brand Oziva Aarti Gill said, “The most effective way to focus on work is treat it like your everyday routine so dress for work. You can also organise your space and turn it into a workstation. Be in touch with your colleagues online.”

Other tips shared by employers include giving a defined start to the day, planning tasks with time sheets, taking short breaks, staying connected, set daily goals, among others. Founder of BridgeLabz Narayan Mahadevan said, “It’s important not to multitask to get the maximum output. Also, to map progress, one should create and update a to-do list.”

Sandip Chhettri, chief operating officer at TradeIndia, said the company has developed a software to ensure employees remain focused on their work. “We have also developed an app to monitor the activity of our salesforce, which helps them work remotely,” he added.

MADURAI: The Madurai Corporation has begun work on an alternative road on the Vaigai river to connect Vaigai South Bank Road with Vaigai North Bank Road, as the Kuruvikkaran Bridge is to be demolished to make way for a high-level bridge.

Officials said the contractor is providing the alternative route as per agreement. While the work order has been issued to the contractor, he will pull down the existing bridge once the alternate road is completed and tested fit for vehicular movement. Traffic police will also be consulted before demolishing the existing bridge, which was constructed around 50 years ago, since it is an important link between the southern and northern parts of the city.

“Basic structure of the road has been created by mounting soil and levelling it. Giant pipes are used to provide culvert like structure to allow the water in the river to pass. Once the soil got settled, bitumen road will be laid over it. The work is expected to be completed in a week or two,” an official from the engineering wing of the corporation said.

Corporation commissioner S Visakan said that the existing bridge will be demolished as soon as the alternative route is ready and construction will start without any delay. There was no need to go for land acquisition for this project since there is adequate space available. There is an encroachment by a private bar on the northern part of the city, which will be cleared when the work starts, he said.

The new bridge is planned at a cost of Rs 27.5 crore. It will be 1.5m higher than the existing bridge. It will also have a total width of 17.5m, including a two-metre-wide pedestrian pathway on either side. The total length of the bridge will be 223.20m, an official said.

424,['19/03/2020'],Gujarat: Court orders woman to return to her husband,"Representative image

AHMEDABAD: A Gandhinagar court ordered a woman to join her husband and fulfil her matrimonial duties after she couldn’t furnish evidence that her husband suffers from mental illness.

The woman, a junior clerk in the secretariat, deserted her husband three years ago claiming that he was suffering from schizophrenia and his erratic behaviour caused her mental pressure. She also filed for divorce on the grounds of his mental illness besides citing cruelty by him and her in-laws.

The woman is from Giyod village and her husband lives at Dashela village near Gandhinagar. They married in 2014. She got a job in a Vadodara court in 2015. A year later she got another job at the Sachivalaya and shifted to her matrimonial home. She left her husband and in-laws and went to live at her maternal home in Giyod in 2017. She filed for divorce in March 2019, and her divorce application is pending in a Gandhinagar court.

Two months after the wife filed for divorce, the husband approached the court and demanded restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The deserter has to establish justifiable ground for desertion.

The husband claimed that since he was a farmer, his wife looked on his profession as below her dignity. He refuted his wife’s claim that he was suffering from schizophrenia and asserted that she had deserted him only because she does not like this marriage.

In reply, the wife claimed that she came to know about her husband mental condition immediately after marriage. During a schizophrenic stroke, he got violent and would continuously laugh without any reason. As soon as she came to know about his illness, she got a government job for security.

The wife, however, told the court that during their interactions for two years before their marriage, she did not find any symptoms of schizophrenia in her husband.

The court, while ordering her on Monday to go and live with her husband to fulfil her matrimonial obligations, said that she could not furnish any evidence to establish husband’s mental illness. Without this evidence, there was no justifiable reason for desertion.

After a few months, they exchanged their cellphone numbers and began chatting. On June 16, 2018, Jambhle proposed marriage, saying that he loved her. The complainant stated that she too had fallen in love with him and they began meeting each other.

On November 8, 2018, Jambhle allegedly took the woman to a flat in Chandkheda and raped her. Later, he allegedly took her to a hotel near Adalaj and raped her.

The woman stated that she had told her parents in December 2019 about her relationship with Jambhle. But when her family members asked him if he wanted to marry her, he said no.

Jambhle later told the complainant that his parents were against their marriage. The woman stated that she continued to ask Jambhle to marry her for about two months.

On February 20, 2020, her parents met Jambhle and requested him to marry her. But he allegedly abused and threatened them with dire consequences. The woman fell into depression and had to be hospitalized. She later filed a police complaint.

Chandkheda police arrested Jambhle on Wednesday and booked him for rape.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

MADURAI: Major vegetable markets at Paravai and Mattuthavani have decided that they will not shut down but continue to receive their supplies though they have no facility to store the perishable vegetables.

The Paravai vegetable market on the city’s outskirts sees about 50 to 60 lorries from Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka , Maharashtra and Delhi as well as Indore and Agra bringing loads of vegetables everyday. Uncertainty prevails among the vendors as to how to price their vegetables following the information circulated amongst them saying the markets would be shut from March 19.

Manuel Jeyaraj, president of the Paravai Vegetable Market association said there was no direction from the government yet on closure of markets. ``We get our potatoes from Indore, Delhi and Agra, onions from Maharashtra, and vegetables such as cauliflower, beans and carrots from Karnataka in tonnes. These are perishable items that are essentials too, so they cannot close the markets,’’ he said. Thangaraj, a vendor in the market, said they were told that lorries from outstation would not be permitted into Tamil Nadu from March 21, ``This will definitely cause a crisis, at least as far as potatoes and onions are concerned,’’ he said. R Gowri, a housewife, said she was concerned that tomatoes and onions would not be available if markets closed. President of Mattuthavani Vegetable Market Association P S Murugan said they had informed the government that they were an essential service and that closing market was out of question. ``We know that people have to build their immunity to withstand the virus. What will they do if they cannot buy vegetables? After all, not all people can afford to buy and hoard and vegetables cannot be hoarded,’’ he said.

MADURAI: Even as collectors of the southern districts conducted awareness sessions with various stakeholders on Wednesday, the Virudhunagar collector asked fireworks industries to allow only 50 workers to work at a time.

A Covid-19 preventive meeting with various stakeholders such as lodge owners, car rental owners, omni bus operators and marriage hall owners was held in Virudhunagar district . Speaking at the meeting, Collector R Kannan said Covid-19 infection spreads 20% by coming in contact with the air that an infected person coughed or sneezed into and 80% through surfaces touched by the person. Hence, all people should wash their hands at least seven to eight times a day and avoid touching their faces.

All organisations employing more than 50 people were asked to ensure that only 50 worked at a time. People can call the numbers 011-2397804 ,044-29510400 and 044-29510500 and 9444340496 and 87544487 throughout the day for information, he said. A similar awareness session was conducted by health and revenue officials in Theni district at Kumili and Cumbum bordering Kerala. All people coming into Tamil Nadu were screened and vehicles sprayed with disinfectant. The screening would be conducted throughout the day, Theni district collector Pallavi M Baldev said.

Ramanathapuram collector K Veera Raghava Rao has asked people to refrain from crowding at places, and wash their hand regularly. Awareness is being created at all levels by officials. Many district collectors announced cancellation of grievance meets.tnn

431,['19/03/2020'],"ZP polls: Velim, Nuvem set for high-stakes battle","Margao: The stakes are high for both Congress and BJP in Nuvem and Velim constituencies for the March 22 zilla panchayat polls.

While Congress is keen on “teaching a lesson or two” to the defectors who switched over from the grand old party to the saffron camp, BJP, which has failed to field candidates on party tickets, is determined to gain a foothold in these two Catholic-dominated constituencies. The BJP has strategically supported independent candidates in the two constituencies, realising fully well that it could fare miserably if it nominated candidates on party lines.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant was forthright when he admitted that the party needed more time to convince Salcete voters about BJP’s principles. “It will require some more time for the people (of Salcete) to accept the principles of the BJP and its ideas of development, though the MLAs believe in them. The eight months (since the Congress MLAs defected to the BJP) may have been too short a period for this,” Sawant said, interacting with reporters on the sidelines of a corner meeting at Davorlim recently.

BJP has fielded candidates in only two constituencies — Davorlim and Guirdolim — of Salcete, which has nine zilla panchayat constituencies, while extending support to independents affiliated to BJP MLAs in the rest.

In Nuvem, BJP MLA Wilfred D’Sa has extended support to independent candidate Breezy Fernande,s while Congress has fielded Assuciana Rodrigies as its candidate. Political observers say that both candidates are equally poised and the contest could be heading for an exciting finish. What has lent some advantage to Congress is the support it has received from former MLAs Francisco Pacheco and Aleixo Sequiera.

In Velim, though it is a six-cornered contest, political observers feel it is going to be a straight fight between independent candidate Anthony Rodrigues, or Babush, as he is popularly known, and Congress candidate Julio Fernandes. Rodrigues, who had won the 2010 ZP polls, is now seeking a second term, while Fernandes is a greenhorn in grassroot politics.

While Rodrigues, political observers say, could be enjoying covert support from Velim MLA Filipe Neri Rodrigues, Fernandes has been extended support by Velim sarpanch Savio D’Silva. Rodrigues, however, denies in public that he is supported by the BJP MLA, stressing that he enjoys support from across the political spectrum.

Congress, however, has made its anti-CAA(Citizenship (Amendment) Act stand the poll issue and has also been asking voters to reject the candidate “sponsored by the Congress-turned-BJP MLA.”

AURANGABAD: The Pundaliknagar police on Tuesday rescued a 20-year-old youth who had been kidnapped by alleged private moneylenders from Partur in Jalna district .

The youth was reportedly kidnapped as his father had failed to pay the exorbitant interest rate charged on a loan he had taken.

Pundaliknagar police station’s assistant inspector Ghanshyam Sonawne said around 2 pm on Tuesday, they received a call informing that some suspects had kidnapped a youth from near the Hotel Shalimar, forced him into a car (with registration number MH-44-B-2867) and were heading towards Gajanan Maharaj temple.

Acting on the information, the detection branch team from the police station rushed towards the High Court signal and went towards Baba petrol pump. A few metres away, the police spotted the car and stopped it. The suspects managed to get out of the car and flee — leaving their vehicle and the youth, identified as Atul Satish Hajare , behind.

In his statement to the police, Atul, who hails from Partur but has been residing in Pundaliknagar area, said that his father is a tour operator. About a year ago, due to financial crisis, he had taken a loan of Rs 1.70 lakh on 5% interest. As a surety, his father had given two blank cheques and had signed a blank bond paper.

Atul said the suspects started collecting money from his father with an interest rate of 30% from the following month. Despite repaying an amount of Rs 17 lakh, the suspects refused to return the cheques and bond paper.

A month back, the suspects allegedly snatched their jeep (MH-21-BH-0686) and forcefully took possession of their house in Partur. Fed up with the harassment, the family then shifted to Aurangabad . On Tuesday afternoon, Atul was kidnapped when he stepped out of the house to meet his friend, The four suspects, allegedly using a firearm and a sharp-edged weapon, kidnapped him and were trying to take him to Partur.

While the winter season this year has been uncharacteristically warm, the temperature on Saturday, as the summer season progresses, was three degrees below normal. And then on Wednesday, it was nearly two degrees above normal.

The pleasant weather has given way to warmer nights due to a change in wind direction and a cyclonic circulation over central Maharashtra. While the mercury had remained somewhat low during the first fortnight of March due to western disturbances and northeasterly winds blowing towards Goa, the change in wind direction seems to have upset the regime. “The easterly component of wind has become stronger, and cloudy weather is trapping the heat from escaping,” Rahul M, scientist, India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji said.

But the circulation over the neighbouring state’s mid-region is expected to weaken by Thursday morning, and night temperatures may again decrease gradually over the next three days.

“At the most, the minimum temperature may hover around 22 to 23 degrees C,” the scientist said. The maximum temperatures have been within the normal range throughout March, though the mercury crossed 35 degrees on at least seven days in February, at the fag end of winter.

On Wednesday, IMD recorded a maximum temperature of 33.6 degrees C, just 1.6 degrees above normal.

Bandyopadhyay’s wife, Calcutta University vice-chancellor Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee , also did not venture out of their home, while the doctor who had first examined the teenaged patient was placed under home quarantine.

As the search for secondary contacts of the patient continued, there was some reassuring news from the Beleghata Infectious Diseases Hospital as the boy’s parents and the family’s two drivers tested negative for Covid-19.

Officials said the patient himself was doing fine, but there was concern over how the family’s alleged carelessness between Sunday and Tuesday left many others potentially exposed to the virus.

Apart from Bandyopadhyay, the list of those at risk includes several home department staffers and a Kolkata Municipal Corporation official who met the patient’s mother at the state secretariat on Monday. Several residents of Nadia who were treated by the Covid-19 patient’s paediatrician father on Monday and Tuesday may have also been put at risk.

CM Mamata Banerjee did not hide her anguish at the slip-up. “We welcome citizens who are returning from abroad. But we do not welcome the virus. Those coming from abroad should undergo medical tests. It applies to everyone, whether the person is a VIP or an LIP (less important person),” she said.

440,['19/03/2020'],Bankrupt travel agents seek govt help,"Visakhapatnam: The global coronavirus outbreak has brought the travel and tourism industry to a standstill. A majority of travel agents in the city and state have started to cut down costs by asking their staff to go on unpaid leave for the next two months or altogether terminating their contracts. Small and mid-sized travel agents have already shut down operations.

Tour operators TOI spoke to said they had initially hoped to make do with business from domestic tour packages this summer given as there were restrictions on travelling abroad, but that plan too seems unviable in the face of the worsening health situation in the country. Summer tour packages accounts for 50 per cent of the revenue of tour operators each year.

Andhra Pradesh has about 400 agents, of which 100 focus on outbound tours and 300 agents on domestic travel. As per statistics from tours and travel associations, losses for agents in AP will be about 15 crore per month. The estimated loss to the industry in January is Rs 8 crore; February, Rs 12 crore; March, Rs 15 crore; April, Rs 15 crore; May, Rs 15 crores; and June, Rs 15 crore.

K Vijay Mohan, president of Tours and Travels Association of Andhra (TTAA) said, “We were all hoping that we could survive on business from domestic travel, but now with a shut down in Gangtok, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Kerala and Andaman, the hope is lost.” Adding that the usual business pattern of travel agents in terms of revenue in January, February, March, April-June, July-September, October-December is 10%, 5%, 5%, 50%, 10% , 20%, Vijay Mohan added, “This year, the corresponding figures are 5%, 1%, 0%, 0%. From January to June, we usually get 70% of the year’s revenue, but the expected revenues of around 6% will kill the travel industry.” The tours and travel agents, in a letter, requested the government to extend some help to them. Stating that tourism contributes 9.3% of the country’s GDP, they said the state and central government should help travel agents by offering special concessions on income tax rebate, waiver of GST for six months and a moratorium on loans for six months to one year. Dheeraj of DC holidays who is the vice president of TTAA, said, “The operations of travel industry has come to a complete halt and most of the travel agents will go bankrupt. We request the government to provide support for the next few months as the panic might continue throug the year.”

Chitturi Srinivas, manager of Akbar travels, said, “People are not willing to travel now. They want to cancel their trips and want the money to be refunded.

441,['19/03/2020'],"Mother of twins stranded in Kuala Lumpur, kids in city","Visakhapatnam: Although 185 Indians from Kuala Lumpur landed at Visakhapatnam International Airport on Wednesday by an Air Asia flight, there are others stranded in the Malaysian capital.

V S S Sindhusha from Visakhapatnam who has been living in Kulala Lumpur for the past four years was in the city with her parents for eleven months after delivering twins last May. However, she had to go back to Kuala Lumpur to renew her visa which expired on March 7, 2020. She left her babies with her parents as she planned to come back within three weeks after the process was completed.

However, Sindhusha’s mother on Tuesday informed her that the babies were crying and not eating properly. Sindhusha who had booked her tickets for this week went to the airport to prepone her travel, but was told that flights to India had been cancelled. She, along with others stranded in Kuala Lumpur approached the Indian High Commission. “On Wednesday, we approached the Indian embassy and spoke to the officials. They said they were helpless and nothing could be done as the government had passed order to cancel all flights till March 31.”

“I tried my best to look for other options to reach Visakhapatnam via Singapore or Thailand. However, I was scared that if I would get stranded in other airports. At least here I am with my husband. But we are desperately waiting to see our babies. We are facing a lot of problems as there is no food available here,” added Sindhusha speaking to TOI from Malaysia.

Sindhusha’s father, Nagesh, who is a CID DSP said, “We appreciate the efforts by the Indian government to contain the spread of coronavirus. However, flights from Malaysia have been cancelled without prior notice. We are worried about her as Malaysia is under lock down. We hope there is some intervention from the government to bring back stranded people.”

“I wanted to get my visa renewed as I planned to be with my babies and celebrate their first birthday in Visakhapatnam along with my family. I put in a lot of effort to figure out some way to come back, but there is no support in any way. I hope the government helps us so that I can be with my children,” Sindhusha said.

Sindhusha, who has been living in Kuala Lumpur for four years, came to Vizag after the birth of her twins 11 months back. She returned to Malaysia to renew her visa. She is unable to return as flights to India have been cancelled

MYSURU: Poultry farmers, who were already reeling under a slump due to coronavirus scare, are now staring at a bleak future as chicken sales have nosedived after the outbreak of bird flu in the district.

The prices of chicken and eggs have crashed following a complete ban on movement of poultry products from Karnataka to Kerala. It further fell in the domestic market after people desisted from consuming chicken at hotels, roadside eateries and at their homes due to bird flu outbreak.

The roadside eateries and kebab stalls that sell non veg-food are also on a sticky wicket as consumers are keeping a distance due to coronavirus and bird flu scare.

The price of chicken, which was Rs 150 per kg some 15 days ago, is now available for Rs 40 and 60 per kg. The price of egg has also come down to Rs 2.9 from Rs 5. Over 20 lakh eggs and tonnes of chicken produced by over 100 big and small producers in the district remain unsold resulting in a huge loss to the poultry layer farmers, said sources in the animal husbandry department.

The district has over 100 poultry units, both broiler and layer farms. These are concentrated on roads connecting Gaddige, Bogadhi, Hunsur, Nanjangud and H D Kote, Bannur and T Narasipur. Major egg suppliers like Mangaluru Coastal Broiler Supplies, Suguna, Venkateshwara and others have suffered huge losses due to the bird flu scare.

“Last year, the poultry farmers suffered losses due to the rise in prices of poultry feeds. However, this year, the coronavirus scare and bird flu have forced them to shut down their business after suffering heavy loss. The cost of production per egg is nearly Rs 3.7. Now, the poultry producers are forced to sell them at a throwaway price of Rs 2.9, and that too with hardly any buyers. What is worrying the layer farmers is that the price of egg is likely to come down further once eggs from Tamil Nadu’s Namakkal district arrives in city market,” said Lakshmikanth, one of the layer poultry producer on Nanjangud Road.

Another poultry producer from Chowdenahalli village in Periyapatna taluk, Lokesh, said both small and big poultry have suffered an unprecedented blow due to the virus and bird flu scare. The price of one kilo broiler chicken has come down to Rs 8. “Even if we are ready to sell chicken at throwaway prices, people are not coming forward to buy as most of the chicken and egg stalls have been issued closure order by municipal bodies both in neighbouring Kerala and several districts of Karnataka,” he said.

Mysuru district poultry producers, who used to supply tonnes of chicken, are now worried about their future. The poultry producers, including both small and big ones, rear nearly 20 lakh chickens in the district.

“The cost of production of broiler chicken comes to nearly Rs 100 per kilo including Rs 19 to buy a chick, poultry shed, power, vaccination and other costs but there are no takers due to the outbreak even if we are ready to sell in distress,” said Lokesh.

443,['19/03/2020'],Spl team to speed up land acquisition for service road,"Trichy: After public outcry over the delay in commencing the construction work for a service road on Trichy-Thanjavur National Highways (NH83), the district administration has appointed a special team to expedite the land acquisition process. So far, in-charge revenue department officials had been overseeing the land acquisition process.

On October 2019, the Madras high court asked the state government and NHAI to lay a service road for the 14.5-km stretch between Thuvakudi and Palpannai within six months, but the stakeholders have been delaying the work. Angered residents staged a protest a week ago as road accidents have become frequent on the stretch of the NH83, which was commissioned during 2011-12.

Meanwhile, as a significant development, the district administration has appointed a team of 11 revenue department officials. The team will undertake land acquisition for the pending service road. So far, revenue officials deployed for Trichy-Chidambaram NH were additionally overseeing the work on service road.

The 11-member team has a tahsildar, a revenue inspector, a surveyor and other officials to be supervised by a district revenue officer (DRO) cadre officer. The team said that they are awaiting a revised land plan schedule (LPS), which will mention the extent of land required for the service road to come up in three widths namely 45 metres, 50 metres and 60 metres. “NHAI is finalising the LPS, they have assured us to hand it over for initiating land acquisition before the end of March. The special team exclusively appointed for the project will quicken the land acquisition,” a senior official with the district administration said. Once the LPS is submitted to the revenue department, 3D notification as per NHAI Act will be released by disclosing the extent of land to be acquired for the service road, officials said.

In a communication to the SR general manager, he said that as a Parliamentary Railway Advisory Committee member, the recent actions of the railways are unacceptable. Railways could ask the people to refrain from coming in crowds to send passengers. People can also be politely denied entry by security personnel at the gates. He said the decision not to provide blankets to passengers on AC coaches was implemented in a single day which was irresponsible. Instead, railways should have taken the responsibility to provide hygienically safe blankets.

The government was asking people to avoid unnecessary travel, but the railways continued to collect cancellation fees. Brealthyzer tests for its employees by the Southern Railway should also be dropped as the aviation ministry had stopped it as a precaution. A lot needs to be done in terms of creating awareness among the public by the railways, he said.

Meanwhile, commuters are now trying to bypass the increased platform ticket fare by buying passenger tickets to nearby destinations that cost only about Rs 10 one way. A commuter said that the platform ticket fare at Rs 50 is more than the fare of Rs 35 to Rameswaram, which is more than 160 kms away. We also have other means to check those misusing passenger tickets,” a railway official said.

Employees of the Elcot IT park at Navalpattu said there is no thermal scanning to detect those with fever or provision to sanitize hands with alcohol-based sanitizer at the entrance of the park.Spread over 60,000 square feet, the Elcot IT park accommodates six IT and ITES companies with a collective employee strength of 1,500. As part of preventing Covid-19 outbreak at workplace, the IT department had in a circular instructed IT office spaces to provide hand sanitiser to staff. “Many of the employees stay in hostels along with inmates from various states. To prevent infection, the entrance of IT park should have had hand sanitiser and thermal scanner. But both are missing,” an employee who did not want to be identified said. Employees at the IT park said they feel insecure at the workplace equipped with a common washroom which has only one handwash, that too non-alcohol-based. While the IT department circular insisted on thermal scanning for all employees attending office, the IT park employees said this is not done. Trichy city has about 68 companies in the IT and ITES sector, a majority of them functioning outside the IT park. But several firms have not officially facilitated the work-from-home option for their employees. Companies say that the infrastructure required to work, such as high-speed internet to make international calls, is available only at the workplace. “Employees feel a little uncomfortable to work at the office. Though precautionary measures such as banning food from outside were taken up in our office, we feel vulnerable while travelling to the office,” an employee of an IT firm in the city said.

The survey which began four days ago will conclude by Monday.

After Chest Hospital reported several suspected cases, GVMC’s medical wing formed teams with volunteers, ANM, Asha workers and sanitary workers at Sachivalyas. The survey teams identified around 195 persons in the city who have come from abroad.

“All of them are kept in quarantine in their houses. Local ANM and Asha workers were asked to keep a watch on them. We also asked their family members not to take them to conferences or weddings,” GVMC chief medical officer Dr Sastry told TOI.

Vizag city has more than five lakh households and now volunteers along with other team members are busy with the survey. The survey is going on in all the eight zones in the GVMC.

GVMC medical staff asked AU students to identify persons who had gone to coronavirus-affected states recently. “AU students are spreading awareness on campus and some of the students approached us and requested to be allowed to join the survey. We have already set up 10 corona help desk centres to create awareness,” Dr Sastry said.

447,['19/03/2020'],"Inheriting a state dogged with issues, Pramod Sawant emerges unscathed, a year on","PANAJI: A week is a long time in politics, so a year should be a good time to judge what chief minister Pramod Sawant has done since assuming office on this day at 2am, last year.

The ayurvedic doctor-turned-politician had exceptionally big boots to fill. He was trying to fill the void left by Manohar Parrikar, Goa’s tallest politician, so it’s not really a surprise that Sawant chose to walk a different path. Knowing that the previous system was well entrenched under Parrikar, Sawant started his innings with a new set of bureaucrats, all handpicked by him. He reshuffled the bureaucracy, unsettling those close to his mentor, and for a while, there were allegations of de-Parrikarisation.

At every step, Sawant knew that his actions – or even the lack of them – would be compared to Parrikar. The former chief minister would micromanage almost everything, so Sawant had to be different. He’s been trying to do just that.

In politics, public perception matters more than anything else. Perhaps, the BJP managers have consciously tried to carve an independent image for Sawant; that he is simple, approachable, accessible, and one who is willing to take suggestions.

Sawant has tried to directly connect with the people, assuring them that major issues plaguing the state cannot be resolved in one year. That he needs time, and he would deliver as promised.

His well-cultivated image of a Bahujan samaj CM from a weaker economic section, is there for all to see, and seems to have struck a chord with the OBCs and tribals.

Politically, there’s little to complain. The start was challenging. He had to face bypolls and parliamentary elections within two months of taking over. Losing the bypolls would have invited criticism. He ensured his critics had nothing to complain about, winning four seats, although he lost the most prestigious seat of Panaji, which Parrikar had represented for the quarter of a century.

The bypoll results enhanced BJP’s strength in the house to 17, but he was still dependent on the allies – three members each from GFP, MGP and two independents. Realising that he would not have it easy as BJP didn’t have the numbers, he tried to increase the party’s strength in the assembly soon after taking over.

Sawant first clipped the wings of his deputy Ramkrishna Dhavalikar , got two of the three MGP MLAs – Manohar Ajgaonkar and Deepak Pauskar – in a midnight coup and then topped it all by convincing a 10-member Congress group to join BJP. From 13 MLAs in 2017, BJP had jumped to an astonishing 27.

He showed considerable guts too, quite unlike someone who was considered a ‘soft’ CM. He dropped two deputy CMs –Dhavalikar and Vijai Sardesai – besides two ministers from GFP to make room for new faces. In a new realignment of forces, Michael Lobo was inducted into the cabinet, along with four others.

With an unprecedented strength of 27 MLAs, it was expected that the Sawant government would take big strides. But it has not been easy, largely because he inherited several problems dogging the state - poor finances, the Mhadei water dispute, mining closure, opposition to the casinos, degrading environment and garbage management.

The Mhadei issue has hit him the most— that the Centre kept him in the dark while deciding on diversion of waters or writing a letter to the Karnataka CM, reflected his lack of clout, a political analyst said.

Financial management has been another concern; besides, there seems to be no sign of the jobs that unemployed youth were promised more than two years ago.

Sawant had to also face a lot of flak for issues like the potholed roads, perpetual traffic congestion along the Agasaim-Cortalim route, floods in several parts of the state and breakdown of main pipeline at Curti which led to an unprecedented water shortage in the state capital and surrounding areas for several days. The CM, though, stood tall and refused to budge during the taxi strike, even though some of his party colleagues lobbied hard for the taximen.

There is no doubt that Sawant is putting in long hours of work, at times, traversing from one end of the state to the other, but he would need to up his game and make some smart moves to show that he is making a difference.

Sawant’s elevation was welcomed by many during the first two months of his innings. Living up to that image, and those expectations, has been tough.

A total of 989 birds were killed and scientifically disposed to prevent the spread of avian influenza during the day.

On the first day of culling, five rapid response teams (RRT) killed 4,100 birds which were within one kilometre radius of Kumbara Koppal. As per the survey conducted by the animal husbandry department, there were 144 households where they had reared 6,436 birds out of which 1,252 were domestic birds, 5,100 commercial birds, 254 pet birds, 12 quails and 18 turkeys.

After the first day of culling, nearly 2,336 birds had remained. On Wednesday, 13 RRTs conducted the drive at Metagalli, BM Sri Nagar, Ambedkar Jnana Loka, Kumbara Koppal and Hebbal and culled 981 birds. Out of the total birds, 304 were broiler chickens, 160 egg-laying chickens, 173 country chicken (Naati Koli) and 326 adult Naati Koli , 20 pet birds and six turkeys.

Deputy commissioner Abhiram G Sankar told TOI that the RRT teams will conduct mopping up operation from Thursday to find whether any birds are left out during the drive. “We will conduct a mopping operation and if more birds are found, they will be scientifically disposed,” he said

According to vet department sources, there are still nearly 1,355 birds remaining in the localities.

“On Wednesday, the staff had a tough time convincing the house owners to hand over their pet birds like parrots for culling. In each house, we had to convince the people, which was difficult. So, less birds were culled on Wednesday,” said an official.

Meanwhile, during the combing operation, the vet staff and Mysuru City Corporation health officers found a small factory near Ambedkar Jnanloka, run by a man called Akram, where buffalo horns weighing more than 3,000 kg were stored in large numbers. The horns were used to make buttons and show-pieces.

The health officers found that Akram had not procured trade license from MCC or clearances from Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB).

MCC health officer M S Jayanth told TOI that Akram has no trade licence. “So a fine has been levied for the violation. The factory has been sealed. The veterinary department will issue a notice on Thursday and action will initiated,” he said. MCC has levied Rs 10,000 fine for the violation.

Mandya bans sale of chicken

Visakhapatnam: Following the outbreak of coronavirus, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) officials are in a Catch 22 situation. The sale of meals on trains handled by IRCTC Visakhapatnam area officials is down by 60 per cent in the past 14 days.

Officials said, initially there was a drop in demand for non-vegetarian meals including chicken and eggs. Officials tried hard to provide substitute vegetarian meals such as idli, dosa and veg cutlet for breakfast and paneer or any veg curry for lunch and dinner. However, they could not improve the situation as gradually the number of passengers onboard started dropping. “First the passengers were reluctant to take chicken and eggs. Now passenger occupancy onboard has decreased considerably. With this, the sale of food, especially on pantry cars, has dropped by more than 60 per cent,” Chandra Mohan Bisa, the area official (Visakhapatnam) of IRCTC told TOI.

Sale on long distance trains has also been affected considerably. One of the nine trains originates from Sambalpur and ends at Nanded in Maharashtra.

An official confirmed that on Hirakund Express (Visakhapatnam – Amritsar) that departed on May 15 they could sell meals worth Rs 22,359. Whereas the average sale figure on that train is around Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000. “Despite giving our best effort to maintain cleanliness and hygiene on board, sale is not picking up. Rather, I would say it is deteriorating almost every day. People are actually apprehensive to buy outside food and our problem is worsening as passenger occupancy onboard is decreasing,” said an onboard supervisor of IRCTC. Although IRCTC hires an outsourced agency to run the pantry car, it also appoints a BSc Hotel Management graduate on board to supervise the production onboard every train.

Though the locations of the sentinel surveillance centres are yet to be finalized.Since all Covid-19 testing centres in the state are overloaded, the state government has roped in Rajiv Gandhi Biotechnology Centre, Thiruvananthapuram , for conducting these tests in the community.

Now, Kerala government is also thinking on similar lines, with increasing agreement within the state government that early steps and identifying areas with Covid-19 presence, can help them take stern steps to prevent it from turning into an epidemic (fourth stage). Currently, Covid-19 infection is at stage 2.“We should start testing at the community level and keep monitoring. I understand that Kerala government is looking on those lines,” said healthcare expert Dr K P Aravindan.So how will this help? “This will not only help assess the risk to the community but also to identify an area with Covid-19 infection.

MADURAI: Two of the busiest places in Madurai, the Mattuthavani Omni bus stand and Madurai railway junction, are showing signs of the Covid-19 impact with less people turning up at both the transport hubs for outstation travel.

While railways has done away with the provision of blankets for those travelling in air-conditioned coaches, many omni buses which offer night travel also have these provisions. Sleeper buses are equipped with bedding and curtains. Officials from the regional transport office supervised the disinfecting procedures at the bus stand on Wednesday when all vehicles were sprayed and sanitized.

President of Madurai Omni Bus Operators Association A Mydeen Basha said there was a drop in people travelling out of Madurai though buses coming from the cities were running full. This could be due to the work-from-home orders of companies. He claimed that it is not that people are panicking about travelling, but want to remain at homes with their families, and hence avoid unwanted travel.

They usually operated 150 omni buses from Madurai to Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Thiruvananthapuram among other places but now it was less than 100. The RTO had asked all sleeper buses to do away with curtains, and blankets in their sleepers. ``We wash the blankets every day and curtains once a week. Now we have decided to do away with both and reduce the AC in the buses so that people do not need a blanket, till March 31’’ he said.

“We have been told to work from home, but as a bachelor I feared that I would not be able to get food if there is a total lock-down. So I informed my office and am going to my home town in Karaikudi to work from there,’’ said S Saravanan who works in an MNC in Chennai. Finding a seat in the Madurai railway junction is a difficult task for a traveller at any time of the day, but now the entire station looks deserted. Southern Railway has announced cancellation of regular and special trains due to low occupancy from March 18. These trains include Duronto bi-weekly, Ernakulam jn- Velankanni special train.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Health minister K K Shailaja has urged all the doctors and other health department employees who are on leave to re-join duty with immediate effect.

It has also been decided to extend the working time of primary health centres in the state till 6 in the evening. The government has also decided to appoint doctors on a temporary basis if there is any shortage in any district.

Meanwhile, at Sree Chitra Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology, none of the doctors or employees who had been under quarantine tested positive in the preliminary tests. The detailed results are awaited, said a statement issued by the institute.

“No positive cases have been reported today. Strict monitoring has been introduced. Around 100 employees are on self-quarantine. An internal screening was conducted today at the institute,” said the statement.

The management has also initiated welfare activities to those in quarantine with the help of faculties and employees.

The Regional Cancer Centre has brought out certain regulations for crowd control. The director has said no person, who travelled from the Covid-19-hit countries in the past one month, will be allowed inside the hospital. Such people should avoid accompanying or mingling with cancer patients as it is highly risky since those with cancer have very low resistance power.

Widespread misappropriation of funds came to light when an audit was conducted at the society in 2018, where around 5,000 farmers hailing from villages such as Swamimalai, Nagakudi, Palayakottai, Thiruvalanchuzhi, T Mangudi, V Mangudi, Valayapettai, Baburajapuram, Thimmangudi and Puliyancheri are members.

Officials had asked society secretary M Selvam to hand over the keys of the vault and related ledgers, which carried details of the members and the volume of jewellery pledged by them, sources said. As Selvam did not obey the directives of his superiors, the officials lodged a complaint with Swamimalai police. But, Selvam secured an anticipatory bail from Madurai bench of the Madras high court.

More than 400 farmers who had pledged their jewellery at the society as collateral for loans could not redeem their valuables even after repaying their loans. “I got a loan from the society after pledging my 40 sovereigns of jewellery in 2017. When I decided to redeem them, the news of misappropriations by Selvam came out and subsequently the safe vault was out of the control of the society authorities,” V S Revathi of Valayapettai, one of the members of the society, said. D Ramya of T Mangudi, and Sumathi Namasivayam of Thiruvalanchuzhi were also among those who are not sure about their jewels.

There are several check points to monitor the functioning of every society. Co-operative field officers, sub registrars, deputy registrars are there to examine the functioning of the societies to ensure that all is going as per norms. So there are no chances of such misappropriations happening without the knowledge of the higher officials, secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai S Vimalnathan said.

He also asked the authorities to conduct an inquiry into the secretary’s activities since he had joined the society. The co-operative officials, who approached the high court, opened the vault and started verification of jewels. Joint registrar of co-operative department Thanjavur Egambaram told TOI that they commenced the verification process of valuables in the vault.

BHUBANESWAR: The state government on Wednesday asked the management of various factories, plants as well as contractors to strictly follow its guidelines for workplaces and construction sites where work from home for the workers is not possible.

The managements of several factories and contractors have been asked to encourage their workers to wash their hands with soap and alcohol-based hand rubs frequently and thoroughly. The guidelines were issued by N Thirumala Naik , the state director of factories and boilers and also the labour commissioner. He asked the management of factories to stay at home if they are unwell or down with flu-like symptoms.

To minimize contact among the workers, the employers have been asked to explore flexible working hours and instructions have also been issued to sensitize them to not spit in public places and to cover their nose and mouth with a handkerchief or tissue paper while sneezing and coughing.

The employers will avoid grouping and gathering of workers and employees at worksites, while the workers will be sensitised to practising social distancing.

Discourage workers from using other workers’ phones, desks, offices and work tools and equipment to the extent possible. Factories with public address or visual display system may utilize the same for educating workers on the measures to prevent possible exposure to Covid-19, the guidelines read.

Naik, in the guidelines, also suggested the employers to inform and encourage workers/employees to self-monitor for signs and symptoms of Covid-19 while the employers will also develop a system so that they can report when they are sick or experiencing the symptoms of Covid-19.

Whenever employers will notice any sign or symptoms of Covid-19 among their colleagues, they will be asked to isolate him/her. Even as there is no specific isolation room at the worksites, managements have been asked to develop designated places with close-door facility as temporary isolation units.

The state government has asked them to maintain housekeeping practices, including routine cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces, equipment and other elements. Steps should also be taken to maintain hygiene in the canteen and dining rooms. Worksites with crèches will lay special emphasis on disinfecting those thoroughly.

The workers/employees at the worksites have been asked to avoid meeting with foreign delegates or technical experts from outside the state.

Officials said more than 30 lakh workers in Odisha are engaged in various factories, plants or construction activitiess.

The steps were taken after advisories were issued by the Indian Dental Association and Dental Council of India .

Goa Dental College is now attending to only a fraction of the 100-odd patients it otherwise sees. The decision to attend to only emergency cases was taken at a meeting of all heads of departments of the dental college on Monday.

“We have told patients that only emergency cases will be treated till March 31. These include cases of swelling, abscesses, fractures, severe toothaches, root canals and other trauma,” a senior consultant at the hospital said.

As a result, staff strength has also been reduced. Besides clinics, patients - especially senior citizens and children - sitting in waiting rooms could also be at a risk of being infected. Extra precautions are being taken to sanitise tabletops, chairs and all other surfaces.

Posters have been put up around the college informing patients of the risks the virus poses.

The dental college, however, continues to remain open till 4.30pm.

Private dental clinics have also begun following suit.

“We have deferred all non-emergency procedures and are attending to those with acute problems only. The precautions are more for the safety of our doctors as we face a high risk of getting infected,” a dentist from Panaji said.

The Indian Dental Association has strongly recommended that all dentists in the country voluntarily suspend non-essential and non-urgent dental care up to March 31. It has stated that it “does not make this request lightly. It is being done as an abundance of caution during this serious outbreak and historic public health emergency”.

TRICHY: Bringing some relief to Nendran farmers hit by the fall in demand for the banana following the Covid-19 restrictions, the district agriculture marketing department has sent 3 tonnes of the variety procured from a farmer in Trichy to Chennai. This follows the farmers’ SOS to the government to help sell the tonnes of banana meant for Kerala, the lone market for the variety but where its demand has now plummeted.

Nendran is being cultivated on 3,300 acres in Anthanallur , Manikandam and Lalgudi blocks in the district and tonnes of it is transported to Kerala where it sells as various value-added products like chips too. The outbreak of Covid-19 led to a slump in businesses in that state following the restrictions on public movements forcing traders to stop procuring Nendran from Trichy. TOI had reported the crisis faced by the banana farmers. Subsequently, agriculture marketing officials took certain decisions to help the crisis-ridden farmers get a reasonable price for their produce.

Deputy director of agriculture marketing Murugan visited banana processing centres at various places in Trichy and took steps to operationalise the facilities that farmers can make use of for processing, value addition and ripening. The department procured 3 tonnes of Nendran banana from a farmer in Rettaivaickal village and took it to the primary processing centre in Mannachanallur . “We got it ripened and washed. The entire consignment was sent to a shop run by Tamil Nadu Horticulture Development Agency at Chemmozhi Park in Chennai”, Murugan said. They procured the banana for Rs 15 per kg from the farmer without any commission.

472,['19/03/2020'],Companies wait weeks for coronavirus test validation,"NEW DELHI: While the US Food and Drug Administration gave clearance for diagnostic tests for Covid-19 within 24 hours of application by two companies, in India a handful of companies looking to get their tests validated have been waiting for a month, or more in some cases.Several companies have been approaching every government institution, from the Department of Biotechnology , the National Biotechnology Mission of the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), ICMR, NIV, health ministry and the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) from the first week of February onwards with proposals to get their test kits for Covid-19 validated.“NIV expressed helplessness saying they do not have enough positive samples to do the validation. It is quite impractical to have a single centre for test validation. There seems to be no urgency on the part of the government in helping the development of indigenous capabilities. There are no guidelines regarding what processes need to be completed to have a test validated. So all of us are running from one office to another and trying to meet many government officials hoping to speed things up,” said an executive of one of the companies looking to get its test validated.According to sources in NIV, nine companies have applied for validation of their tests and the institute has finished validating tests from four of these. What is delaying validation is the fact that NIV is currently the sole agency for validation. The government is learnt to be in the process of identifying more of them.With a global shortage of reagents and testing kits, India could find it difficult to expand testing as and when demand ramps up. As the US looks to expand testing, it is expected to buy up millions of test kits being produced by the two companies that got US FDA approval -- Thermo Fischer and Roche. The ICMR has stated that it has a stockpile of reagents for one million tests and has already placed orders for more.Labsystems Diagnostics had set up a joint venture with Yingsheng Biotech of China . This JV has used Yinsheng’s experience in developing a real-time test kit in January now being sold widely in China. “Gaining from that expertise and knowledge, our India scientists are indigenously developing a Covid-19 kit and this will be sent to NIV Pune for approval next week. While the imported kits costs Rs 2,000-4,000 per test, we are planning to launch the Make in India kit at Rs 500 to 700 per kit depending on volumes. The commercial kit will be launched in about three weeks’ time depending on clinical validation,” said Dr Velu of Trivitron, Labsystems’s parent firm.Dr Velu said they were working with the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in Delhi to do lab-based validation of the test. He added that though NIV was the main centre for validation, it was inundated with work.“We are already using our reagents for other kits like dengue, chicken guinea, HBV, TB etc. So these reagents are well tested and of proven quality. All are manufactured in house and so scale up may not be an issue,” said Dr Shesheer Kumar of Huwel LifeSciences, another company awaiting validation of its test kit.USFDA commissioner Stephen Hahn was reported as saying that the agency had been in touch with 80 test developers that planned to bring their tests through the emergency process.

474,['19/03/2020'],Ravi Varma’s Vishwamitra painting fetches US $ 8.6 lakh,"Vadodara: An artwork in oil depicting Sage Vishwamitra deep in meditation has once again pushed the brilliance of legendary artist Raja Ravi Varma into the international art domain after Sotheby’s auctioned the painting for a record price of US $8.6 lakh.

Sotheby’s had opened online bidding last month for an estimated price between US $7 lakh to US$ 9 lakh for this untitled painting ‘Swami Vishwamitra in Meditation’ that depicts the firebrand mendicant surrounded by a halo of rare calm composure. The bid closed two days ago after an unknown bidder bought the rare painting, originally part of a private collection of Fritz Schleicher, a German printer who had worked with Varma and later acquired by a private collector in Denmark.

This is the second-highest price that Varma’s paintings have fetched at Sotheby’s.

In 2017, ‘Damayanti’, another masterpiece by Varma, the father of modern Indian art, was sold for US$ 16.92 lakh. “The price that the Vishwamitra painting has fetched exemplifies the international recognition and interest that Raja Ravi Varma’s works enjoy,” said Sachin Kaluskar, an art connoisseur who has a rich collection of Varma’s oleographs.

Describing Varma’s works, Sotheby’s says that in 1894, after producing a large number of oil paintings, Varma founded India’s first oleography press in Lonavala (now in Maharashtra). ‘To help reproduce his paintings, Varma employed Fritz Schleicher from Berlin, who was highly qualified in colour lithographic printing as the manager of the workshop.

Varma eventually sold the Press to Schleicher in 1903, at which stage the firm was renamed The Ravi Varma Fine Art Lithographic Works, Sotheby’s website states.

Not only Ravi Varma, who shared a deep bond with erstwhile Baroda as he was patronized by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in the late 19th century, the city also shares its history with Sage Vishwamitra. Vishwamitri River that flows through the heart of the city was blessed by the mendicant who is believed to have authored Gayatri Mantra on the banks of this river that flows by his name.

475,['19/03/2020'],Dirty toilets at HQ mirror VMC’s lip service to safety sermons,"VMC has opened many several washrooms for public and its employees

Vadodara: While it has been preaching safety mantras to the public asking people to wash hands frequently, use sanitizers and take other precautions to prevent COVID-19 spread, Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), however, fails to practice its own sermons.

The civic body has opened several washrooms for public and also its own employees at the Khanderao Market . Most of these toilets, which are used widely by visitors even do not have soaps. Interestingly, some of these are even used by its own staffers.

The toilets are also not cleaned frequently, though the civic body has a battery of sanitation workers at its disposal for the city’s cleanliness activities. In contrast, VMC was seen trying to take steps to ensure that those meeting the mayor clean their hands by either washing them or using a sanitizer.

The civic body could take a leaf out of district collectorate’s cleanliness measures which include installing wash basins outside the Kothi building. The step is being taken to ensure that whoever comes there first washes hands.

VMC commissioner Nalin Upadhyay said that he had come to know about the situation on Wednesday itself.

“I have instructed the persons concerned to ensure that soap is provided in all the washrooms. We want to do this not only at Khanderao Market, but at all our offices,” he said. When informed that this had not been done till late in the evening, Upadhyay said that he would take up the matter again.

While washrooms mirror a part of the issue, the incessant spitting from the lobby of the civic body on the first floor into the parking below is another glaring example. The civic body at the other end, has been penalising those spitting in public across the city.

""After so many years, my dream of motherhood is becoming reality, and all credit goes to doctor ma’am,"" she says with a smile.

""Ask any of the thousands of childless couples and no one will say they want boy or male child. They just want to have a baby and become parents. On the other hand, many of those who are blessed naturally with children discriminate between a boy and a girl,"" says Dr Laxmi Shrikhande, one of the leading infertility specialists in Central India.

Dr Laxmi has helped thousands of couples become parents. And through her social mission she encourages girls to get educated and counsels boys on understanding importance of gender equality.

The inspiration comes from her own story.

Born and brought up in a very orthodox Marwadi family, she was the second daughter of her parents, an unwelcome girl child. ""My parents wanted my brothers to become doctor, engineer, and lawyer. Their only aim for me was to marry me off at the earliest,"" she recalls.

Young Laxmi had to struggle a lot as higher education for girls was not allowed in her family.

""I became a rebel. After finishing the household chores I would study overnight in a small kitchen of our two room house, get up early in the morning and start cooking,"" she says.

""I am working for girl education since 2004. I visit schools frequently, tell girls not to lose morale and pursue education in any case. I share my example with them. Gender bias in families is the root cause that deprives girls of education,"" she says.

""Changing the male mindset is a must. This should start right from school days. So, we added ‘Beta Samjhao’ angle to the ‘Beti Padhao’ campaign. Educated girls and sensible boys will together build a successful society,"" she says.

This campaign includes sensitizing teachers in the first phase. Doctors conduct workshops for teachers and discuss important aspects of adolescent health issues. They share how teachers can teach boys regarding natural changes and how to explain gender equality, social and moral values to them.

""This will inculcate respect for their female classmates and will eventually help curb sexual assaults on women,"" says Dr Laxmi.

This campaign was initially run in Nagpur last year where more than 1,200 teachers and principals attended the workshop. Looking at its impact, the Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Society (FOGSI) has decided to replicate it nationwide.

In the second phase of ‘Beta Samjhao’, doctors will visit schools to interact with students in the second phase.

Dr Laxmi dreams to see a society where no girl has to struggle for education and no boy will assault a girl.

479,['19/03/2020'],Sterilisation drive against stray dogs to be intensified in Hubballi-Dharwad,"Hubballi: Amid mounting complaints from residents about stray dogs , and a recent incident wherein three children were set on by canines in Old Hubballi, the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation ( HDMC ) has decided to intensify the sterilisation programme to control their population.

The Bengaluru-based ERF, a Non-Government Organisation (NGO), had been entrusted the task of sterilising stray dogs in the twin cities, and more than 1,000 canines were sterilised. However, in the wake of the menace sprouting its head again in the episode of three children being attacked by strays, HDMC has decided to step up the drive. The civic agency will also take stringent measures to prevent unloading of trash on the sides of the road and public spaces, to prevent avenues for dogs to rummage for food.

Dr Ravi Saligoudar in the veterinary department of HDMC, said that the sterilisation programme was a continuous process, and one that was conducted at regular intervals. “Owing to technical problems, we had to suspend the drive last year. But the initiative was restarted after a few months,” Dr Saligoudar said.

However, he said that they were planning on tackling the problem for the longer haul. Instead of floating a tender inviting agencies to carry out the sterilisation drive for a year, HDMC had decided to call for a three-year tender.

Sources in the civic agency said that staff working in the HDMC control room had been directed to relay complaints about attacks on public from stray dogs to their superiors. “Regardless of whether any action has been taken in pursuance of the incident, they have been told to compile all information about the incident. Staff in the health department have asked to act post-haste on receipt of a complaint,” a source said.

Poorly illumined streets in the twin cities, ironically enough, only illumine another dimension of this problem. Residents pointed out that the fear of dogs added to the difficulty of walking in the dark.

Although HDMC officials visited Hyderabad among other cities to study the implementation of dog parks, they have not been able to translate the knowledge that they acquired into reality in the twin cities. Mohan C, a social activist, urged the HDMC commissioner to consider the plan more seriously. “He should involve NGOs in this endeavour so that it is implemented with few hassles. The civic agency must also formulate other plans to curb this menace,” Mohan added.

481,['19/03/2020'],"Despite availability of more water, changing schedule denies benefit to Hubballi-Dharwad residents","Representative image

HUBBALLI: The situation that residents of various areas in the twin cities is not dissimilar to that of a sailor lost at sea – water, water everywhere but not a drop to drink, as the cliché goes. The installation of a new water treatment plant, the operations of which are supplemented by those of two smaller units, have resulted in daily water supply to Hubballi-Dharwad increasing by more than 40 million litres. However, residents appear unable to profit from this surplus for various reasons.

The difficulty that Dr Vidya Madgaonkar, an anaesthesiologist in Jayachamaraj Nagar, faces in stocking up on water tellingly illustrates the problem. Dr Vidya waited up till 11pm on a day when supply of water to Jayachamraj Nagar had been previously announced, but went to bed disappointed. Unfortunately for her, Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation ( HDMC ) started pumping water to her locality at midnight that day. However, Dr Vidya had to resign herself to a brief dry spell at home.

In another case, Sunanda, a lecturter in Lingaraj Nagar, had requested a neighbour to stock up water for her as well. Sunanda had been informed that HDMC was supplying water to Lingaraj Nagar through the media, and she did not want to wait for her area’s next turn. However, she had not factored in HDMC’s changing schedule , which left her utterly disappointed when she returned home to be told that water had not been supplied on that day.

These are not isolated incidents. Hundreds of residents across the twin cities face this problem on a daily basis. Along with the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board (KUWSDB), HDMC set up the new water treatment plant, which can pump 40 million litres of water from Renuka Sagar in Savadatti and Aminabhavi, with two more minor units. Consequently, the frequency at which water was being supplied to the twin cities increased to once in three or five days, where residents had had to wait for almost ten days before. However, the lack of a fixed schedule specifying areas that are to receive water on a corresponding day of the week has resulted in residents not benefitting from the surplus.

Dr Vidya, however, was generous in her appreciation of KUWSDB for ensuring sufficient supply of water, particularly with the mercury levels soaring in Hubballi-Dharwad. ""But it seems as though we have to be prepared to stock up round the clock owing to the uncertainty of when and where the water will be supplied. We are being taken for granted. Of course, when there is an emergency like a power shutdown, rescheduling is understandable. But the schedule is being changed very often. KUWSDB must return to the system of alerting residents via SMS,"" she said.

Mayur Nagar resident Nivedita Rajput said that the inconstant schedule had only made storing water at home more difficult for her, since both she and her husband were employed. She too made a case for KUWSDB to revert to the system of alerting residents through SMS.

KUWSDB, Hubballi division assistant executive engineer Umesh RK said that, regardless of what day water was supplied, the timing was fixed: 5am to 11pm. ""Residents have no need to worry if water is supplied after 11pm, it is merely to ensure continuity of operations till the next day. We are making it a point to intimate residents about water supply in advance through various forms of media.

483,['19/03/2020'],Govt moves to enforce strict quarantine,"All the 820 randomly collected samples have tested negative and do not indicate any community transmission . However, we will ramp up our sample numbers and continue to do surveillance to check if there is any further spread,” a senior official and scientist at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) told TOI.The results are crucial because they are part of a scientific assessment to evaluate whether the virus has spread through community transmission. “We are not exactly ruling out community transmission but the fact that these samples have tested negative is reassuring that at the moment there is no evidence to indicate community outbreak ,” the official added.The government has decided to allow select private labs to test even as officials said WHO’s call for more testing was not country-specific and pointed out a close watch was being maintained on any spike in Covid-19 cases (within current testing criteria) and in general admissions of patients with serious respiratory illnesses, signs that might indicate a wider spread.While the random tests are being evaluated, health minister Harsh Vardhan held a review on Wednesday on containment and management of the novel coronavirus , directing teams be deputed to regularly inspect and monitor quarantine facilities for ensuring necessary amenities are being provided. The move came after reports of Indian nationals returning home complaining ab- out the poor state of facilities.ICMR had earlier said that around 1,040 samples through its 52 labs (each collecting 20 random samples) of patients admitted in ICUs at various hospitals, including private, due to influenza-like illness have been collected between March 1 and 15 to assess if the virus infected those without a history of travelling abroad or having come in contact with persons who have.“Some of our labs informed us that referrals were not enough to do all the samples. Hence, some of them collected less than 20 samples. So, we could test only 820 in this batch,” the official said.As part of continued surveillance, ICMR will collect random samples of people wi- th SARI but without any travel history on a weekly basis. A total of 121 labs will be functional soon for the purpose. Each lab, in medical colleges across the country, has a capacity to test 90 samples per day.The ICMR’s random testing to check community transmission is running parallel to the testing and tracing of symptomatic travellers and their contacts. At present, the total capacity for over 70 functioning labs along with National Institute of Virology , Pune, is 8,000 samples per day. However, these labs are doing around 500 samples every day.Health ministry officials maintained India is still in stage II with limited localised transmission and there is no need for community testing.The government, however, has already started ramping up its preparations for the risk of community transmission and the community testing that it might require by ordering one million additional testing kits, besides extending the network of testing laboratories.There are four stages in a disease outbreak: Stage I is usually when cases are imported and not of local origin. Stage II is when there is local transmission of cases reported, which means a section of people that is testing positive is due to having come in contact with a laboratory positive person who had a travel history. There can be a single case or local clusters of positive cases in stage II.Stage III is community transmission, wherein the scientists working to contain the outbreak are not able to pinpoint the source of infection. A person tests positive without any travel history or any contact history with a laboratory positive case.The last stage-IV is when the outbreak is declared an epidemic, where it has spread to the entire country and cases return positive one after another in large numbers without any information on source of infection. India currently is at Stage II of the outbreak, which experts say can be contained locally.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-moves-to-enforce-strict-quarantine/articleshow/74701829.cms

Even as another 14 flyers were quarantined at MLA Hostel, Kumar said after conducting test on them, they are being stamped on the hand and released for the 14-day home quarantine. Currently, 159 people are under self-isolation in the city.

“A team of 50 officials has been especially assigned the home quarantine list. A control room has been formed at the district collectorate from where they are making calls to these people. Area-wise WhatsApp groups have been formed to send regular reminders to stay indoor twice a day,” he said.

Kumar said a meeting was also held with the police department at his office and a list was handed over to the cops to ensure people in home quarantine don’t venture out.

Kumar warned that those violating the orders would face strict action. “This is not a frivolous issue and quarantine guidelines shouldn’t be taken lightly. If a violation comes to our notice, we will file an FIR,” he said.

JT CP Ravindra Kadam said, “We keep a check on them as we keep vigil on criminals and their whereabouts. We visit the houses of such people and see whether they are present at home or not. We also have a list of such persons and distributed it to concerned officials. We are making time to visit their house, but we cannot guarantee that once police visit is done such persons will not leave their houses. It is a restriction that they should impose upon themselves. If you are quarantined for some definite thing you should follow the restriction. However, every time we have visited their houses, they were present and no such persons were seen wandering in the city.”

However, staff at the local police stations said they have not received any such list as yet. TOI spoke to several senior officials from police stations, and all said they have not received any list regarding those who have to be home quarantined.

“We have not received any such list at our police station. From what we have heard, all such flight passengers are directly sent to Mayo Hospital for check up,” said a cop from East Nagpur.

Cops from West, South, North, Central and South-West parts of the city also reiterated that they were not aware of home quarantine measures nor has any list come from either their own department, the district administration or health officials.

On March 18, TOI had highlighted how there were differences between officials and cops regarding home quarantine monitoring. It was believed cops had received the list on Tuesday itself. There were unconfirmed reports of such people stepping out of homes and meeting outsiders at their places, though norms prohibit all such acts.

485,['19/03/2020'],"Blood banks going dry in state, people urged to donate","Nagpur: With many blood donation camps and regular blood donation activities cancelled along with public events due to coronavirus threat, blood banks in the state are set to face severe blood crisis from next week. Most blood banks have a limited stock which will last for six to eight days only.

Hundreds of critical patients being treated in city hospitals require blood while literally thousands of those suffering from blood disorders like thalassaemia and haemophilia require regular blood transfusion. If blood banks will go dry, it could have a fatal effect on these patients.

Realizing this, Blood Transfusion Council of Government of Maharashtra has appealed to people to donate blood by visiting such banks. The council has also appealed to social organizations to hold blood donation camps in a restricted manner to ensure blood supply in the state.

“State Blood Transfusion Council urges organizations to maintain scheduled blood donation camps. Donating is a safe process and people should not hesitate to give or receive blood or platelets. Blood banks have implemented additional precautions to ensure safety of donors and staff,” says the statement issued by the council.

“If we stop blood donation, more people will die due to blood shortage than coronavirus,” said Dr Harish Warbhe, medical director of lifeline blood bank. “All blood banks in the city are left with limited stock of blood bags. Blood donation activities have nearly stopped in the last two weeks since the coronavirus outbreak,” he said.

Blood bank staffers have started following additional safety protocols like wearing gloves and changing them often, wiping down donor-touched areas after every collection, using sterile collection sets for every donation, and preparing the arm for donation with aseptic scrub. They will also conduct a mini physical test of donor to ensure that the donor is healthy and well on day of donation.

Organizations interested in holding blood donation camps must ensure enhanced disinfection of the venue and equipment. They must provide hand sanitizers to everyone before entering and throughout the donation and conduct temperature checks of donors. Beds, wherever possible, should be kept away from each other to follow social distancing practices between donors.

486,['19/03/2020'],Aapli Bus ridership comes down by 40%,"Nagpur: With many citizens opting to work from home or avoiding use of public transport to minimize their exposure to novel coronavirus (Covid-19), Aapli Bus ridership has gone down sharply.

Against an average ridership of 1.50 lakh per day, the number of daily commuters has come down to 90,000,” confirmed a senior official from Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s transport department. This has also resulted in reduction of daily revenue collection from Rs 21 lakh to Rs 15 lakh, he added.

Through three Red Bus operators and one women-only bus operator, the NMC plies 361 buses on 112 routes. These buses make around 5,500 trips daily by travelling over 80,000km per day.

Because of the Covid-19 outbreak and resulting curbs imposed by authorities, the ridership is certainly going to see further drop.

“We’re totally disinclined to take the bus service away from commuters at a time when there’s so much stress because of the coronavirus,” said transport committee chairman Narendra Borkar, adding: “NMC’s city transport service is a lifeline for many. If citizens are still commuting, you have to assume it is essential to the functioning of workplaces or for other purposes like visiting hospital, market places etc.”

“Though educational institutions and some other organizations will remain shut till March 31, keeping in mind the risks associated with the Covid-19 outbreak, we have, in fact, increased two trips each to ensure social distance between passengers on seven busy routes during peak hours,” he said.

Borkar said though the NMC operates 361-bus fleet of Aapli Bus on 112 routes, seven routes — Kamptee, Kanhan, Kalmeshwar, Khaperkheda, Butibori, Ambajhari-Defence and Hingna witness heavy rush. Most of the rush is witnessed during peak hours of morning and evening, he said.

Besides, the Aapli Bus operators have already taken up the task of disinfecting city buses twice a day.

This decision has been prompted by the preventive shutdown imposed in Maharashtra till March 31 in view of the coronavirus outbreak.

For Nagpur schools, the decision has been necessitated because once schools open in April, the planned academic session is hardly for two weeks. A principal said, “We know very well that majority of parents won’t send their kids for just 10 days of school considering the coronavirus fears. Many other principals are planning to give a grade/marks based on the student’s previous performance.”

As per RTE, no student can be detained/asked to repeat any class till Std VIII. “With the no-fail policy still in effect, the exams are not exactly a determination of pass and fail but a measure of how much has been understood by the child,” said the principal.

489,['19/03/2020'],Forced vacation keeps parents busy with kids,"Nagpur: As students find themselves in for a forced vacation due to shutdown, parents are forced to adapt to the situation and keep their children busy throughout the day. With restrictions on outside travel and public places, the task is even more challenging for parents. At the same time, all parents are enjoying the extra family time.

Dr Vaishali Khetrapal said the side benefit has been that all of them are spending more time together. “Though the actual reason behind this holiday is not good at all, we are enjoying this break as a family. Being a medical practitioner, I get less time with my family, but now we have made it a habit to have breakfast, lunch and dinner together,” said Dr Khetrapal.

Ahilyaa Taneja said indoor games have come to her rescue. “I play board games with my child and we have many hours dedicated to his study everyday,” said Tanjea.

Amit Singh said it’s a mix of activities that keep his son engaged. “For entertainment, there are books, board games and educational videos. I also urge him to step out in the backyard and play for at least an hour. The main benefit of this shutdown is that he can spend ample time with his grandparents which is otherwise difficult due to daily routines,” said Singh.

Manish Puri said the holiday is bringing out the creative side of his son. “We are trying to occupy him with new paints and drawings as he loves that. We are trying our level best to keep him off the constant use of social media, and are making him occupied by online teacher training programmes,” said Puri.

Ujjwala Raut said it’s a difficult time to manage. “It takes a bit of doing because it is natural for kids to be attracted towards TV, phone etc. But still, with a bit of thinking, we can keep them engaged in a productive manner,” said Raut.

Sheetal Sharma said she is encouraging her child to read more. “Instead of wasting their time on social media and video games, it is important to make the long days productive. Studies are of course important too. Due to this forced vacation, we are also getting to spend a lot of family time together,” said Sharma.

Shabhat Raza said the situation is unfortunate but this forced vacation has many advantages. “Those parents who are unable to spend time with their children due to their busy schedules are able to spend time with them. I prepare my child for exams regularly and fix time in the day for studies,” said Raza.

Sudha Raut said it was indeed a challenge to keep kids engaged all the time. “Due to this sudden vacations, daily schedule has been disturbed as there is no playing and all kids stay awake till late. We still try to keep them engaged in homework as tuitions are also closed, or any other physical activities at home only as it’s not safe outside,” said Raut.

Pooja Jichkar said she is simply enjoying spending time with her son. “We have a good time together and I give him some or the other work to keep him busy. When the schools reopen, there will be no problems and he will be back to routine,” said Jichkar.

But, they are trying their own methods and tricks to keep the virus at bay. “I am drinking hot water by putting neem leaves in it every day. I miss going to parks with my friends and chat with them after dinner sitting under the tree in our locality. But I spend my time stitching, cooking and reading,” said Jasoda Devi Khatri.

Some senior citizens have also stopped going for morning yoga sessions. They are drinking herbal tea and applying nilgiri oil to the hands as a sanitizer. “Senior citizens mostly have low immunity.

“Consistent with the above, effective 2019-20, in the medium term, the dividend payout ratio is expected to be around 80% to 85% of the profit after tax of the Company,” the company has said.

A source close to the development said that the numbers declared is the highest in the last few years. “The average dividend payout in the last three years was 68% of the profit after tax,” added sources.

It is learnt that the company would announce a hefty dividend because the investment cycle of the company is coming to an end so new big investment requirement is not there. “Need for retained earning would be less,” added sources.

As per Sebi guidilines, one has to set out the parameters that will be taken into account by the Board of Directors of the Company in determining the distribution of surplus to its shareholders and/or retaining profits earned by the company. “Dividend distribution will also recognise foreseeable opportunities and threats in the globalised competitive context. The Board may declare interim dividend(s) at its discretion. The Board’s recommendation to the shareholders on the final dividend may include special dividend(s) as considered appropriate.

Thus, it becomes imperative that the time of close proximity interaction with the passengers is kept minimum, without compromising with the security procedures,” he stated.As part of the new approach, CISF personnel have been asked to maintain proper gap between passengers for optimal use of door-frame metal detector and also hold hand-held metal detector (HHMD) 2.5 cm away from the passengers’ body during frisking and increase the number of its swipes. In case HHMD beeps, the passenger would be asked to show the affected portion himself and remove the prohibited articles for security clearance.Importantly, the crime and intelligence wing of CISF deployed at airports for behaviour detection must also look out for potentially infected/sick passengers and alert the security personnel. Such passengers must be asked to visit the airport health officer (APHO) for a checkup and advised to wear a mask. They may require a fit to fly certificate from APHO who has the power, apart from the airline concerned, to refuse their entry into aircraft if they are symptomatic or require further screening.As for pat-down checks which involve contact with the passenger’s body/clothes, they may be undertaken in case of strong doubt about carriage of plastic explosive or prohibited articles, but with utmost precaution.Ganapathy told TOI: “CISF is fully geared to meet the challenge of COVID-19 in the airport eco-system, while keeping its personnel safe”.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cisf-to-follow-minimum-touch-at-airport-security/articleshow/74701861.cms

""In a democratic country like India, the rights of any authority cannot be totally arbitrary and unrestricted. The fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution govern not only Indian citizens but foreigners as well, so long as they are on Indian soil,"" Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya said.

Siedcynski, a student of comparative literature at Jadavpur University , had challenged the expulsion order on the ground that he was inadvertently caught in the anti-CAA protest while taking pictures of the gathering from a pavement.

Dismissing the ""confidential report"" submitted by the Union government on Siedcynski, Justice Bhattacharyya said the right to decide on issues pertaining to illegal immigrants or foreigners whose visas had expired couldn't be used against someone to whom the authorities had not only issued a visa, but also renewed it subsequently.

Union minister food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan also said that 75 crore beneficiaries under the public distribution system will be allowed to lift their quota of subsidised foodgrains for six months in one go.

“There is no shortage of foodgrains with the Food Corporation of India . States have been asked to distribute six-month quota of grains to the beneficiaries in one go,” Paswan said. He also told reporters that the government is keeping vigil on the prices of essential commodities and action would be taken against anyone who tries to exploit the situation,” he added.

The decision to provide advance foodgrain has been taken to ensure people don’t face any shortage of supply. This will also reduce the pressure on central storage of the foodgrains.

498,['19/03/2020'],Covid-19 scare: BMC directs nine private hospitals to start isolation wards,"Picture used for representational purpose only

MUMBAI: BMC on Wednesday directed nine major private hospitals and a railway facility to reserve, in all, about 90 beds for Covid-19 patients. It said the beds are likely to be offered at concessional rates —at least 50% the usual charge.

But some hospitals told TOI that starting isolation facilities would take a while as procuring protective gear, training medical workers and creating designated areas will take time. Isolation wards separate ill persons with communicable diseases, whereas the purpose of quarantine is to separate or restrict the movement of healthy people.

BMC said Jaslok, HN Reliance, Hinduja, Kokilaben, SL Raheja, Bombay, and Lilavati can now treat Covid-19 patients, but samples for testing will have to be sent to the civic-run labs at Kasturba or KEM hospitals. A BMC notice said Jaslok Hospital would reserve five beds, HN Reliance two, Hinduja 20, Kokilaben 17, Raheja 12, Bombay four, Lilavati 15, and Gurunanak and St Elizabeth two beds each. Jagjivan Ram Rail hospital will have a 10-bed unit.

Under emergency powers vested with BMC, it can get private hospitals to take in Covid-19 patients. Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said, “One need not come directly to Kasturba, but go to any one of these hospitals. Swabs will be collected and sent to Kasturba or KEM for testing.” Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the isolation wards will become fully operational over a week or 10 days. “We have told them to start with 1-2 beds and scale up gradually,” he said, adding that the decision was made after a meeting on Wednesday. “Once patients land at the airport and are screened by our doctors, they will be given a choice to go to any of these centres if they need isolation,” he said. Currently, travellers are being sent to Seven-Hills Hospital, Marol, that has a 300-bed quarantine facility. Ten patients are quarantined at SevenHills and another ten at the nearby Mirage Hotel.

Several hospitals said setting up isolation facilities could take time. “Personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers is expensive and in short supply,” said a hospital head. Ajaykumar Pande of Lilavati said PPEs now cost at least 5-6 times more than their usual prices. “If the government helps us with procuring PPEs and consumables, we can expedite the process,” he said, adding that Lilavati has started work on identifying a corner where an isolation facility would be started.

Dr Santosh Shetty of Kokilaben said they would reactivate an isolation facility created during the H1N1 outbreak. “We would take within 10 days, we have to factor in existing patients, where to move them, fix protocols and do staff training,” he said.BMC has said a decision on charges will be made soon.
