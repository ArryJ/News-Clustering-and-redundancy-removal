An opportunity to spend quality time with grandparents

‘Don’t instill fear in children about the virus outbreak’

Ways to keep boredom at bay...

A conservationist by profession, Rajesh Puttaswamaiah is busy looking out for creative ways to keep his 12-year-old son, Arya, engaged at home these days. “So far, I have got him a science kit, with which he can build a remote car. He is interested in robotics. So, I thought, this might be a good chance to catch up on the technicalities of it,” he says. Like Rajesh, many city parents are struggling to channel their little ones’ energy productively, as schools remain shut and exams called off amid the COVID-19 outbreak . On a positive note, many are using this downtime to bond with their children — something that they often miss out on, given their otherwise hectic work schedules.Parenting coach and home-schooler Gowthami Saraf says that she has received quite a few calls from parents in the last few days, asking for ideas to make their childrens’ stay at home more engaging. Speaking of options, Gowthami says, “Gardening can be a fun learning activity for kids . Parents can involve their little ones to grow microgreens at their terrace or balcony. Nurturing a plant can help the child bond with nature. Setting up aquariums at home is another option. In fact, there are webinars that teach children about different species of fish that can be cultured at home.”“Since summer camps are no longer an option, I have arranged for a home-tutor for my seven-year-old son, Viaan. He is learning the shlokas as well as self-defence tactics. Besides that, there are carrom and board game sessions at home,” says costume designer Laxmi Krishna, who also makes her son spend some quality time with his grandparents. “My mother loves to tell him stories, and he seems to be quite attentive too,” she adds.“Instead of stressing too much over ways to keep their children busy at home, parents should just relax and spend time with them,” advises Dr Sulata Shenoy city-based child psychologist. It is also necessary to explain the pandemic to youngsters, so that they understand the importance of personal hygiene and not panic. “With their vacation plans scuttled and a restrictions on mingling with other kids, it might make them feel overwhelmed. So, it is pertinent to explain the coronavirus outbreak to them and how it can be prevented,” she explains. Here are a few parenting tips to follow at home:- Do not walk around the house wearing a mask.- Try not to constantly watch news updates on COVID-19 on TV or social media.- Do not indulge in over-parenting by making them wear masks and asking them to repeatedly wash their hands. This might lead to fear in them.- Plan the week for your child and make sure it has a mix of activities - Limit their screen-time and instead engage them in fun indoor activities- Board games are a great way to bond with your kids- Bake cookies or a cake together- Encourage them to take up painting or make eco-friendly crafts- Participate in webinars, as a family",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74653373,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-219209,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/parents-look-for-ways-to-bond-with-kids-and-keep-them-engaged-at-home/articleshow/74653313.cms
1,['17/03/2020'],Will you get to watch your daily soaps?,"In a bid to tackle the ongoing corona crisis, it has been decided that shoots of all TV shows will be suspended from March 19 till March 31. The decision was taken on Sunday, in a meeting between the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE), Indian Film and Television Producers Council (IFTPC), Indian Motion Picture Producers Association (IMPAA), Indian Film and Television Directors’ Association (IFTDA), Western India Producers’ Association (WIPA). JD Majethia, chairman, IFTPC and producer of Bhakharwadi, informs, “Serial production is a vulnerable business. If shoots come to a halt, it leads to unbearable losses. However, nothing is more important than human life. As they say, the show will definitely go on, but we have taken a break to support the industry, state, country and the world at large.”Despite commencing shoots in advance, it’s almost impossible to create a bank of episodes of TV shows. Reason: The storyline undergoes several changes based on the audience’s feedback and ratings. However, given the current scenario, an attempt is being made to shoot as many episodes as possible in a limited time, so that the audience isn’t deprived of their daily dose of entertainment. If the shoots don’t commence even after the banks of episodes are exhausted, viewers will get to see reruns of their favourite soaps.Actress Aneri Vajani, who is seen in 'Pavitra Bhagya', says, “We are putting in more hours so that maximum number of episodes can be shot. Everyone is cooperating, and I hope that we meet the deadline. But more importantly, I hope this virus gets eliminated soon.”Aishwarya Sakhuja, who plays Mahima Srinivasan in 'Yeh Hai Chahatein', adds, “We don’t have a bank of episodes, but I am glad that a lockdown has been declared. This suspension is the need of the hour. Hundreds of people work on our sets every day. Of these, many use public transport and they have an increased risk of exposure to the virus. So, let’s take a break and get back stronger.”Ashish Chowdhry, who is currently seen in 'Beyhadh 2', agrees that a ‘no show’ will have an adverse effect on the viewership. He says, “It will make a difference because people will lose their flow of watching shows and the habit will break. I hope we make some good reruns and recaps to keep them hooked.”While business will be affected, it’s daily-wage workers who will suffer maximum because of the lockdown. Ashok Dubey, general secretary FWICE, says, “Our members comprise at least 90 per cent of the unit. The decision has come as a huge blow to them, but nothing is more important than life. If anything happens to them, their families will suffer, too. We had issued a circular on March 5, instructing every producer to implement safety measures, but some of them didn’t implement them. Hence, we had to arrive at this decision to ensure everyone’s safety.” Talking about the provision of paid leaves for the daily wagers during the shutdown phase, he adds, “The producers have told us that they will have a discussion with the broadcasters about this.”This is the best decision we could have taken for the industry. I am thankful to the broadcasters, producers and other associations for joining hands to curb the spread of the virus. We have taken precautionary measures on our set — right from installing a fumigation machine to a doctor examining every member of the unit, and arranging for masks and sanitisers. However, these are only basic preventive measures. The best prevention is to exercise self-quarantine. The daily wagers will be badly affected, so I would urge every producer to give them half a day’s salary for the duration they won’t be shooting. They are our families and we can’t function without them. This is the least we can do to look after them. We have already promised them paid leaves if they are unwell, but with the shutdown coming into effect, we should help them sustain in these difficult times.— Binaifer Kohli, producer of 'Bhabiji Ghar Par Hain'The health and safety of our team members are of paramount importance. I am not even taking into consideration the monetary loss or ratings. All that is secondary when it comes to human lives. In fact, along with the broadcaster, I have postponed the launch of my show, Anupamaa. For now, I have a bank of fresh episodes of 'Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai', which will last for a week. At a time like this, we can’t have double standards. We can’t have our families stay safe at home and expect the unit to work. I am sure the broadcasters and producers will devise an alternate plan for their respective shows. We can’t have fresh episodes and reruns going on air together.— Rajan Shahi, producer of 'Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai' and 'Yeh Rishte Hain Pyaar Ke'A decision has been taken to stop all shoots, but other factors like telecast and ratings are still under discussion. A decision will be taken after a meeting between the producers and broadcasters, which is slated to take place soon. For now, we are working at breakneck speed to create a back of episodes. On March 30, we shall a take call on the next course of action after analysing the situation.

2,['17/03/2020'],Will Vijay’s #NanbarAjith remark end abusive Thala v/s Thalapathy fan wars?,"The audio launch of Vijay ’s Master was the most-awaited Kollywood event of the season, and it had created buzz days before it was to take place — on Sunday. The team had announced last week that the audio launch would be a closed-door event due to the Coronavirus pandemic, but would be telecast live. While fans were clearly disappointed, they were still eagerly looking forward to their Thalapathy ’s speech.Vijay, who usually turns up for events in semi-casuals, came in a suit for the event. When one of the anchors asked the actor about this look, his response ended up being the biggest talking point of the event. “My designer Pallavi (Singh) has been telling me that I was dressing up poorly for every function. Let’s try something nice, like a suit, this time, she suggested. So, I said, ‘OK, let me dress up like namma nanbar Ajith and go’,” revealed Vijay leading to thunderous applause from the audience.Given how notorious fan wars between Ajith and Vijay rasigargal are on social media, with the rival groups even trending obscene hashtags, industry insiders feel that Vijay’s description of Ajith as nanbar seems to be a step towards telling fans to stop such abusive behaviour.The two actors, who are onscreen rivals, have remained cordial whenever they have met in person.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74654355,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-334728/74654355.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/will-vijays-nanbarajith-remark-end-abusive-thala-v/s-thalapathy-fan-wars/articleshow/74654355.cms
3,['17/03/2020'],Bengalureans resort to panic buying; essentials fly off the shelves across city,"With the state government imposing a week-long partial shutdown on most commercial establishments, including malls and supermarkets , people in the city seem to be in a state of panic. Bengalureans are stocking up on essential supplies at home, as schools and colleges remain shut and professionals work from home. This, in turn, has also led to a temporary shortage of certain commodities at some stores, with e-commerce companies and those running delivery services also struggling to provide groceries and other items on time.A delivery-service app official says, “Ever since city offices announced work-from-home options for their employees, there’s been a surge in the number of orders received. While there are no official statistics available yet, it can be estimated that the numbers have almost doubled over the past week.”Adding to the panic were messages from supermarkets, announcing that stores might remain closed for a few days; and advising people to stock up on essentials. On Sunday, however, there was some respite, as authorities said that supermarkets will remain open, provided not too many people assemble at a time inside the outlet.According to IT professional Rajesh Sharma , his household is prepared even for a complete shutdown. “We have been asked to work from home until things are set right. My children are home too. Given the outbreak, my wife and I are worried to step out for even for a while. So, we decided to stock up earlier,” he explains.On the other hand, Nidhi Kumar , a management professional, is struggling to meet day-day-day household requirements, as both food items and hygiene essentials have flown off the shelves.City’s young folk volunteer to shop for senior citizensA group of volunteers in Whitefield are doing their bit to help senior citizens in the neighbourhood. “Many elderly people stay in our apartment complex, some of whom live alone and find it difficult to make quick trips to the supermarkets or medical stores. Since the older generation is said to be more susceptible to diseases like Coronavirus , they are scared to step out of their homes.

However, the film council in Hyderabad, and the Ramoji Film City have requested us to stop shooting right away for safety reasons. We shot until late morning yesterday. We’d planned for one last night of shoot, but have decided against it.” The director says there’s no clarity on when they would restart the schedule. “I think people have been asked to follow self-quarantine till March 31.

6,['17/03/2020'],Siju Wilson: I have been able to do a wide range of roles this year,"Of late, Siju Wilson is at the busiest he has been in his career, which kicked off a decade ago with Malarvadi Arts Club.He already had a couple of releases with the comedy film Mariyam Vannu Vilakoothi, and the buzz-creating Varane Avashyamund. “It has been an exciting year so far, with interesting projects. I’ve always only wanted to do roles that I am happy with and in the past year, I’ve been listening to scripts that interest me,” says the actor, who played a traffic inspector and a prospective groom to Kalyani Priyadarshan’s character in the Anoop Sathyan directorial.“While it is a cameo, it is a movie that everyone was looking forward to, thanks to the casting of Suresh ettan (Suresh Gopi) and Shobhana madam after a long time. All this had already given the movie some heft, so my only concern when Anoop called to offer me the role was that I had a beard, which however, became part of the character’s look. It would be a religious offering that his mother had made and he can shave only when his marriage is fixed. It was a movie that got noticed and though my role was a small one, I received a lot of appreciation for it,” says Siju.He remembers the two-day shoot as a happy experience. His first scene was with Dulquer Salmaan and Kalyani, and he says the shoot went in a flash, with just quick introductions, but later after the dubbing he got a personal message from Dulquer saying that his role had come out very well. “It was a nice gesture on his part to tell me that I was an indelible part of the film and that I did a good job on it,” he says.Siju is also keenly looking forward to his upcoming releases, the first of which is Upacharapoorvam Gunda Jayan. “It is a script-driven entertainer, with a bit of suspense. Upacharapoorvam Gunda Jayan, which translates to warm regards from, is a phrase that is found on wedding invites in small towns, and the film, shot in Wayanad, is based on a wedding. I play the central character named Kiran and in fact, I feel everyone has performed very well in the film,” says Siju. The film also has Saiju Kurup, Sabareesh Varma, Johny Antony, Sabumon and newcomer Nayana, who plays the female lead.One of his film looks that probably attracted the most attention was his priest get up for Varayan which came soon after Mammootty’s The Priest look was released. The film, directed by Jijo Joseph and written by Fr Danny, has Siju playing Capuchin priest Fr Edison, who is an artist. “My character is a bit of a bohemian priest who is friendly with everyone, in the message-driven, fun film. The heroine is Leona Lishoy. Of course, I can’t say what the story with the heroine is; let that be a suspense,” says Siju, laughing.He is also very proud of Vasanthi, a woman-centric film about a controlling marriage, with Swasika in the lead, and directed by Shinoz and Sajaz Rahman. Siju, who has earlier lost and put on up to 10 kg, as the role demanded for movies, such as Varthakal Ithuvare, also had to get himself a different look to suit the role of Suku, a thief. “Even though it has an experimental narrative, with bits of theatre elements woven in, people have been able to connect to it. I knew it was quite a raw character. This role came to me while I had a smart, attractive look for Thobhama. So for this, I would leave the house after just having brushed my teeth, and without even combing my hair. It really helped me get into the skin of my character and everyone has really noticed and appreciated my effort. It’s been a real thrill as an actor to have been able to showcase such a range of roles already this year,” says the actor.Attachments area",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74652979,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-281914/74652979.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/siju-wilson-i-have-been-able-to-do-a-wide-range-of-roles-this-year/articleshow/74653060.cms

9,['17/03/2020'],Anti-CAA protests in Indonesia could be on the wane,"This week may see a halt in large anti-India protests that have rocked Medan and Jakarta for the past couple of weeks, as the Indonesian government begins negotiations with the groups responsible for them, which involve Islamist groups and civil society groups. On March 6 and 13, large groups have burnt Indian flags and Modi’s effigies, protesting CAA and India’s alleged treatment of Muslims in the wake of the Delhi riots.

Last Friday, the protests in front of the Indian embassy were led by leaders of three prominent banned Islamist organizations – Sobri Lubis of Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), Slamet Maarif of PA 212 and Ustaz Eddy Mulyadi , of GNPF. They were among 13 groups that protested outside the Indian embassy in Jakarta. According to reports, they called for the expulsion of the Indian ambassador, boycotting of Indian products and threatened people of Indian origin in Indonesia.

On February 28, the Indonesian foreign ministry called in the Indian ambassador to Jakarta, Pradeep Rawat to deliver a message. Describing the meeting, sources said, “Civil society organizations and many other organizations had a message and those messages were conveyed (to the Indian government ). People have concerns, but the Indonesian government is confident we are both pluralistic, democratic countries.” In addition, COVID-19 has put paid to regular interactions – sources said foreign office consultations, the second round of security dialogue and a joint working group on counter-terrorism are all on hold.

A veiled criticism has been made against the Indian embassy in Jakarta that they have not “reached out” to some of these organisations like the Majlis-Ulema-Indonesia (MUI). An umbrella group of MUI and some other Islamic groups were scheduled to meet Rawat last week, but a statement by the MUI deputy chairman, Muhyiddin Junaidi upset the Indian side, which cancelled the meeting. The statement said, “The MUI urges the Indian Government to respect the Eleven UN Security Council Resolutions on the fate of Jammu Kashmir residents to determine their fate through the plebiscite and stop the blockade of Jammu Kashmir,"" he said. He added that they would recommend Indonesia raise the issue in the UN Security Council as well as sever ties with India if the Indian government did not agree to their demands. India counts Indonesia as one of its supporters in the UNSC, having played a positive role during the ban on Masood Azhar .

Sources said a meeting has now been scheduled between Rawat and the Indonesian vice-president Ma’ruf Amin in the coming days, for the Indian envoy to explain India’s position. The Indonesian vice-president was the former head of MUI, and generally held to be responsible for the removal of the Jakarta mayor Ahok on grounds of blasphemy. In a recent statement, Ma’ruf was quoted as asking India to follow Indonesia’s example of tolerance. A similar message was given by the country’s religious affairs minister Fachrul Razi.

What has added to the collective nervousness in Jakarta and New Delhi are reports that an Indonesian NGO, Aksi Cepat Tanggap (ACT), had wired money to India around the time of the Delhi riots. The group itself denied such reports. The group was quoted as denying any role in the riots – “ACT supervisory council member Syuhelmaidi Syukur denied the allegations in a statement on Friday: “As a humanitarian organization, we always maintain an independent stance upon implementing our programs. Our objective is to give humanitarian aid since it is our duty.”

The anti-India protests rocking Indonesia, said sources, would take “another form”, raising hopes that they would move away from the thousand-strong protests in Jakarta's city centre. While the Jokowi government has said that Indonesia did not intend to lecture India because Indonesia too had similar “horizontal tensions”, they added that in democracies like India and Indonesia social “pressures and sentiments” had to be “managed”. Indonesia is one of India’s growing strategic partners, but this issue has caused a great deal of nervousness between the countries.

KOLKATA: On Monday evening, Nandan, Nazrul Tirtha and Navina were some of the single screen theatres to close down. That was done to implement chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s directive to shut down theatres till March 31 in the wake of the corona virus epidemic. An advisory was issued by the state government to shut all cinema halls and multiplexes in the public interest till March 31. “All concerned are requested to kindly abide by the decision of the state government,” the advisory stated.On Monday evening, Nandan CEO Mitra Chatterjee said, “Nandan and Nazrul Tirtha will remain shut from today evening till March 31.” Navin Choukhani, owner of Navina, said there were just eight people for the noon show of ‘Angrezi Medium’ on Monday. “In a hall with a capacity of 800, that’s a disastrous figure. Health of our patrons and staff is very important. Besides, there is no point incurring overhead cost when there is no audience. We shut from the night show on Monday as a precautionary measure against spreading of coronavirus . Salary of the staff during the closure period will be paid as usual.”Ratan Saha, the chairman of the exhibitors’ section of the Eastern India Motion Pictures’ Association (EIMPA), called an emergency meeting on Tuesday afternoon. “We are shutting down from Tuesday.

INOX released an official statement saying, “Assigning top priority to the health and well-being of our guests, we will fully respect and follow the Government’s Advisory to keep the cinemas closed as a preventive measure. We would also like to assure our guests that we will be geared up and will look forward to serve them again.” Atin Ghosh, deputy mayor, Kolkata Municipal Corporation, said, “All KMC auditoria, including Star Theatre, will be shut from Tuesday till March 31.”Director Indrasis Acharya, whose 'Parcel' was released on March 13, is expecting that his movie will get a re-run once the theatres reopen. ""We just got three days to screen our movies. That too at a time when the footfall had already gone down. I would definitely want to re-release my movie later,"" Acharya said.Meanwhile, two big shooting units currently abroad have also decided to cut short their schedules and take the flight back to Kolkata. They include Anshuman Pratyush’s ‘ Baazi ’ starring Jeet and Mimi Chakraborty in London and Srijit Mukherji’s ‘Kakababur Protyaborton’ starring Prosenjit Chatterjee in South Africa.Speaking to TOI from London, Pratyush said, “We are leaving from London on Tuesday. Couple of days back, we had sat and discussed how there were chances of the situation turning bad. Even if one of the crew members fell ill, we would have to live the rest of our lives in guilt. We have some 50 members shooting in London. That would be completely unwanted. Even the production was of the same opinion. So, we decided to curtail the shooting in London.” While the shooting began on March 12, the original schedule was supposed to conclude at the end of March. “But we decided to cut that short,” he added.Meanwhile, SVF stalled shootings of web series, Mainak Bhowmick’s film titled ‘Chini’ and the second schedule of Dhrubo Banerjee’s ‘Golondaaj’. “The unit of Srijit Mukherji’s ‘Kakababur Protyaborton’ starring Prosenjit Chatterjee was supposed to return on March 21 and March 22. But decision has been taken to wrap up the schedule earlier. The earliest flight ticket they got was on March 18,” said SVF spokesperson.Back in Kolkata, most production houses either postponed or geared up to cancel the shootings of films, reality shows and serials. Shooting of ‘Abar Bochhor Kuri Pore’, ‘Dictionary’ and ‘Haami 2’ have been postponed. The final call on shooting cancellations for other projects will be taken post a meeting on Tuesday between minister Arup Biswas and all stake holders including the Federation Of Cine Technicians & Workers Of Eastern India (FCTWEI).Actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee is waiting for a directive from the Federation on shooting cancellation of Soumitra Chatterjee’s biopic titled ‘Abhijaan’. “We have a schedule till March 20. A Hindi film that I’m acting in and was supposed to fly out to London for right after my shoot, has been postponed at least to September,” he said. On being asked how much of monetary loss would that be for the film, he said, “Thankfully, it won’t be a monetary loss because most of the stuff can be cancelled. But, it will be an enormous hassle because I’ll have to reschedule mine and everyone’s dates later.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74663461,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-359993,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/coronavirus-scare-jeet-mimi-cut-short-baazi-shoot-in-london/articleshow/74663397.cms

14,['17/03/2020'],‘This is a call for each filmmaker to reach out to his crew and form a chain’,"The coronavirus outbreak has brought the world to a standstill and shaken the global economy. The Indian film industry, one of the largest in the world and the sole source of livelihood for many, has been affected as well. On Sunday, the Producers Guild of India released an official statement, stating that all shoots will be suspended from March 19 to 31, for the safety of all members of the fraternity. While those on payroll will still survive, the daily-wage workers will be most hit by the crisis.In a bid to look after that section of people, who will be the most impacted on an immediate basis, filmmaker Anubhav Sinha proposed a plan. And in no time, other filmmakers like Sudhir Mishra , Anurag Kashyap, Hansal Mehta Nikkhil Advani and Rahul Dholakia , too, joined in. With shoots getting cancelled or delayed, how can you help those who survive on daily wages without tedious paperwork or multiple meetings?Anubhav Sinha told BT, “Daily-wage workers will get seriously affected, if shoots are suspended for more than two weeks. Setting up a fund is a bit complex and so, what I thought was, we should do it at our own personal level. We will start by supporting the daily-wage workers of all our previous films and that way, they will all be covered. I have already asked my heads of departments to inform the daily-wage workers that if they have any problem, they should let us know and I will see what best I can do. If I can take care of it on my own, fine. Otherwise, we can also try and raise money.”Attributing this thought to Anubhav, Sudhir Mishra explained, “All of us can last three-four months without working, but those who work on a per-day basis, cannot. Most filmmakers stick to the people they work with in all their films, so if all of us help our respective crews, they will all be covered. This can be done quickly and without holding 100 meetings or getting entangled in paperwork. Most workers have too much self respect, so they won’t ask for help until we reach out to them. They are always there for us and we are there for them, it’s as simple as that.”Director Rahul Dholakia shared, “Whatever way we can chip in, we should. After all, daily-wage workers are an important and integral part of our fraternity. If we don’t help them, who will?”Nikkhil Advani had a valid point, too. He reasoned, “I can work from home and have meetings online. People on payroll can do the same. But what about those who don’t have such facilities? The technicians, junior artistes, spot boys and make-up artistes... We are not sure if the shoots will resume after two weeks or the restriction will be extended. Daily-wage workers need to be compensated and paid for these days, and that is our motive. How we will set up that fund and whether we will tie up with other film bodies is what needs to be discussed. The Producers Guild of India will have a meeting today (Tuesday) to discuss this as well.”Siddharth Roy Kapur, president of the Producers Guild of India, told BT that he will be in a better position to make a statementon this after Tuesday’s meeting.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74654765,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-74869/74654765.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/this-is-a-call-for-each-filmmaker-to-reach-out-to-his-crew-and-form-a-chain/articleshow/74654765.cms

17,['17/03/2020'],"#SustainableEating: Choose local, seasonal and fresh produce","Even as sustainable practices make their way into our daily lives, it all goes for a toss when we are eating out or ordering in food. Sustainable eating can ensure that our food habits do not interfere with our efforts of leading a greener life. What, how and where you eat your food can dictate whether your carbon footprint is reducing or not. Here are some tips for sustainable eating:It's essential to focus on where you are getting your household produce from. Sustainable eating promotes local farmers and locally grown vegetables and fruits. ""If a food item is shipped across the country, it no longer remains sustainable. Buying local and also cooking local further promotes sustainability. I always buy my kitchen produce from a local thelawala who gets his stock from local farmers instead of shopping for groceries online or to the supermarket,"" says Bhawna Bohra, a chocolatier from Gurgaon.Though sustainable eating encourages you to cook your own food and not order-in, there will be times when most of us give in to the urge. ""My kids had ordered some donuts and burgers a few days ago. While the donuts came in a cardboard box, the burgers came in a paper bag. Now I am using the paper bag for household dry waste while the cardboard boxes are being used for wet waste at my home,"" says Rashi Grover, a freelance consultant from Delhi. When the deliveries are done in plastic containers, some residents like banker Smita Ray from Delhi use them to store their knick-knacks and household essentials like clothes pegs, etc.From cooking leftovers to storing food correctly, there are simple hacks that can avoid food wastage and encourage sustainable eating. The shelf-life of packaged foods should be read carefully and stored accordingly so that they do not get spoiled. Cooking leftovers is a skill that many can acquire with some creativity. ""From reusing old rotis to making sabjis, or pickles out of lemon peels, there is a lot we can do out of leftover food. I often use stale bread for making bread crumbs, one-day old cooked rice to make rice cakes or use one-day old sabji in kathi rolls for my kids. This helps me avoid wasting food,"" says Neerja Khurana, a teacher from Delhi.Whether you are ordering food at a restaurant or buying fruits and veggies, always opt for seasonal produce in order to eat sustainably. ""These days, we can find winter veggies like peas and carrots even in summers. These veggies are not grown sustainably and hence are available throughout the year. Whether at home or eating out at a restaurant in summers, I always tell my children not to order such dishes which use non-seasonal veggies,"" says Supriya Sardana, a dermatologist living in Noida.While on your trip to the market, avoid buying packaged products like canned ginger-garlic paste or processed food items. If at all you have to buy a packaged product, try to opt for one which does not have plastic packaging. When going out, support outlets which are making efforts to eliminate plastic. ""At the Brahmaputra market in Noida, there are many outlets which are now using pattal donas and glass containers for serving and delivering food. We always encourage such outlets and only eat here,"" says Supriya.While this may just seem like an obvious solution, many people tend to overlook the fact that multiple trips to the market can leave more carbon footprint. Moreover, sustainable eaters should plan their cooking in a way that there are no leftovers which go to waste.Whether you are travelling or just going to buy sweets, it helps reduce the use of disposables when you are carrying your own cutlery. ""My cutlery kit includes a steel spoon, fork, straw and a glass. If I am eating at a place where they are using disposable cutlery, I prefer to use my own. Even when I go to buy sweets or take away food from an outlet, I carry my own tiffin box instead of using their plastic containers,"" says Sameera Satija from Gurgaon, who works in a government organisation.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74654591,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-457175/74654591.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/food-news/sustainableeating-choose-local-seasonal-and-fresh-produce/articleshow/74654346.cms

PANAJI: When FC Goa started checking the applicants for the coaching vacancy at the club, they rubbed their eyes in disbelief.

There were coaches who have managed teams at the highest level, there were World Cup winning captains, and even closer home, the list of coaches with proven credentials made for interesting reading. So the club started making a shortlist, and on top of the 37-coach list was Brazilian World Cup winning captain and coach Carlos Dunga .

A senior club official wondered if the Dunga interest was genuine. “He is serious. He says he has heard a lot from friends about Indian football and interestingly, the only club he knows from here is FC Goa,” the Brazilian’s representative told the club.

Dunga won the World Cup for Brazil as captain in 1994 and was head coach of the team, twice. His first spell (2006-2010) saw Brazil win the Copa America (2007) and Confederations Cup (2009) but ended in defeat against Netherlands at the 2010 World Cup quarterfinals. He returned for a second stint in 2014 but a loss in the Copa America led to his early dismissal.

Dunga’s interest in FC Goa could have stemmed from another Brazilian legend, Zico, coaching the club during its first three years. Zico guided Goa to the final at home in 2015, which they lost dramatically against Chennaiyin FC , and then presided over the club’s worst finish when they found themselves at the bottom in 2016.

The Brazilian great is not the only name that has shown interest in taking up the Goa coaching job. There is Guus Hiddink, who coached Netherlands and South Korea at the World Cup, besides former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, Spanish great Fernando Hierro and former Manchester United defender Jaap Stam .

“The club is flattered with the interest that is shown by these great names, but it’s unlikely that they will sign any big name,” said a source who has been tracking the development.

Salary will be the biggest constraint. Zico was the best-paid coach when he was here for three years taking home a salary of approximately Rs 6.3 crore for a five-month stint in 2016, and former coach Sergio Lobera was also the highest-paid coach in Indian football before the club decided to part ways. It is unlikely that the club will break the bank again for another big-name coach.

Instead, the club is more likely to show faith in a younger coach who is hungry to prove himself and will stay true to the club’s philosophy of possession football.

“There are several interesting names who are guaranteed to stay true to the club’s philosophy,” said the source.

The club is likely to make a decision within a fortnight with coaches who have won the I-League, Indian Super League (ISL) and made a name for themselves in European lower divisions making it to the shortlist.

25,['17/03/2020'],Ibuprofen vs Paracetamol: Which medicine to take in case you suspect coronavirus symptoms?,"Read AlsoCoronavirus Prevention

With COVID-19 spreading to over 130 countries now, even a slight fever can trigger people to suspect themselves to have coronavirus. Though the symptoms must not be ignored, and you must contact your doctor in case you fall ill. But what to do when you are self-quarantined at home and need medicine to cure your fever? Should you take Ibuprofen or Paracetamol? Both of them being the widely taken medicines in case of fever.French health minister, Olivier Véran, who is a qualified doctor and neurologist, tweeted on Saturday: “The taking of anti-inflammatories [ibuprofen, cortisone] could be a factor in aggravating the infection. In case of fever, take paracetamol. If you are already taking anti-inflammatory drugs, ask your doctor’s advice.”He advised people to avoid taking ibuprofen as it many worsen the symptoms, in case you are COVID-19 positive. Paracetamol is a safe option for fever and can be taken till you are tested for COVID-19.A senior doctor who didn’t want to be quoted said, “We prefer to give Paracetamol in all viral infections as it is safe for patients.”Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Ibuprofen and cortisone, are known to be of high risk for those who have contracted illnesses because they tend to diminish the response of the body’s immune system.Paracetamol is preferred as it is not only a mild medicine but also because of its ability to tone down fever without counterattacking the inflammation.In the current scenario, handling everything with patience is the key. In order to protect yourself from COVID-19 practice hand hygiene. Washing hands for at least 20 seconds is a must, whenever you come back home from outside. Avoid going to crowded and public places. Wear a mask if you are suffering from fever, cold and cough. Stay away from elders in your family if you are sick, as they are the most prone to contract the infection.Contact your doctor in case you fall ill. After checking your symptoms, your doctor will further advise you whether you should get tested for COVID-19 or not. Do not rush to screening centers without having a word with your doctor. You must also take a lot of fluids and foods which increase your immunity to keep the virus at bay.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74655813,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1186020/74655813.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/ibuprofen-vs-paracetamol-which-medicine-to-take-in-case-you-suspect-coronavirus-symptoms/articleshow/74655813.cms

27,['17/03/2020'],"India Coronavirus: Even Indians from EU, Turkey, UK barred entry","More on Covid-19

NEW DELHI: In measures aimed at containing Covid-19, the government on Monday extended the travel ban beyond affected countries and prohibited entry of all passengers, including Indian nationals, from the European Union, European Free Trade Association, Turkey and the UK to India with effect from March 18.The government also expanded compulsory quarantine for minimum 14 days for passengers coming from or transiting through the UAE, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait.On Monday, the health ministry reported 114 confirmed positive cases of Covid-19. Of these, 13 cases are cured, whereas two patients with co-morbidities died. The total 114 positive cases include 97 Indians and 17 foreigners.With reference to the EU, EFTA, Turkey and UK, the new travel advisory said, “No airline shall board passenger from these nations to India with effect from 1200 GMT on March 18. The airline shall enforce this at the port of initial departure.” The decision was taken after a high-level group of ministers (GoM) meeting on Monday.A senior airline official said, “At this moment, given the restrictions, the option for people to travel between India and Europe/UK/Turkey include flying first to the Far East, to Thailand (Thai), Singapore (Singapore Airlines), Malaysia (Malaysian) or to Bangladesh (Biman to London), Colombo (Sri Lankan to London). They can also use Gulf carriers and Aeroflot (taking connections from Moscow). Some of the options will mean quarantine on return.” The options for US are non-stops of Air India and United (will announce 50% truncated network soon). A senior AI official said the airline will suspend its UK flights from March 18.Last week, the government suspended almost all visas and even passenger traffic on several border check-posts to protect further import of infected cases from abroad. The move came in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases globally and the World Health Organization declaring it a global pandemic.International travellers with symptoms associated with Covid-19 who have so far entered India have also been advised home quarantine where they are monitored for more serious indications. Travellers from affected countries named by the government have to undergo quarantine at an official facility. Depending on norms and protocols, travellers are either quarantined at Army facilities or advised home isolation.Besides travel-related instructions — which will be in force till March 31 and will be reviewed subsequently — the government also proposed ‘social distancing measures’ as a preventive strategy. This includes closure of all educational institutions, gyms, museums, cultural and social centres, swimming pools and theatres. This is in the nature of advisories for states but intends to bring about uniformity in action and underline the need to curb large congregations.The private sector has been encouraged to allow employees to work from home wherever feasible and meetings to be done through video-conferences to avoid people coming together unless necessary.“Contact tracing activity of these positive cases has led to identification of around 5,287 people, who are kept under rigorous observation,” health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said. Apart from these contacts, another 40,000 people are under active community surveillance.Responding to calls for more testing, the government maintained there was “no need to unnecessarily panic and carry out unnecessary testing” as India was still at stage II with limited localised transmission of the virus. Aggarwal said travel restrictions were further tightened to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from high-risk areas.As a preventive measure, local authorities have been advised to have a dialogue with “opinion leaders and religious leaders to regulate mass gatherings and should ensure no overcrowding or at least one metre distance between people”.Local authorities have been asked to instruct trader associations and other stakeholders to regulate hours, exhibit do’s and don’ts, and take up communication drives in market places like sabzi mandi, anaj mandi, bus depots, railway stations and post-offices where essential services are provided.Similarly, organisers of sporting events and competitions are advised to postpone such events. Restaurants should ensure handwashing protocol and proper cleanliness of frequently touched surfaces. The health ministry also activated a toll-free 24x7 national helpline number, 1075, to address queries related to the infection on Monday. The previous helpline number, 011-239 78046, will also remain operational.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74664396,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1750972,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/corantine-even-indians-from-eu-turkey-uk-barred-entry/articleshow/74664374.cms
28,['17/03/2020'],Coronavirus testing lab: Accredited private labs to be allowed to test for Covid-19,"More on Covid-19

NEW DELHI: In keeping with the demand for more testing, the Centre has decided to allow accredited private labs to test for Covid-19. Dr Balram Bhargava, director general of Indian Council of Medical Research – the country’s apex body for health research – confirmed this to TOI on Monday.There are 50 to 60 private labs, accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Laboratories, that can do the test, Bhargava said.At present, only government labs are permitted to do the test. Though their capacity is around 5,000 samples per day, only 60 to 70 samples are being processed daily. This is because current guidelines allow testing only for symptomatic individuals with travel history to affected countries or those in direct contact with an infected individual.Asked whether others who are symptomatic but do not fit the current criteria could be tested too, Bhargava said, “All those who require testing will be tested.” This signals a possible shift in policy to relax the testing criteria.The ICMR DG said the charges for Covid-19 tests in private labs and the modalities for reporting positive cases were being worked out.ICMR has a network of 106 Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) across the country. These labs get samples of influenza like illnesses (ILIs) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) regularly.Scientists said 13 of these labs have been testing 20 random samples for Covid-19 periodically since February to see if the novel coronavirus had spread to the community. The experts said all samples have so far tested negative.Monday onwards, the random testing of ILI and SARI samples – those exhibiting same symptoms as Covid-19 – has been expanded to 51 labs to more aggressively look for community transmission of the novel coronavirus. This would warrant testing people outside the current protocol — that is, those who may not have travel history to an affected country or who may not have come in contact with an infected individual. Community transmission is a stage when the disease starts spreading in the community in general.The ICMR DG said random testing has clearly shown that India was yet to reach the stage of community transmission. “However, we have to be ready. That’s why we are constantly working to add more labs for testing,” Dr Bhargava said.He added that nine additional government-run VRDL labs will be operational for testing Covid-19 from Tuesday, up from the existing 63 such labs. The new additions include VRDLs at Lady Hardinge Medical College and Army hospital in New Delhi and the one at Pune’s Armed Forces Medical College.Bhargava said 70 other government labs — including medical colleges across the country and the labs run by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) — have been readied to conduct Covid-19 tests.Testing for Covid-19 involves two key chemical agents, the primer and the probe. Primer can be prepared locally while ICMR has to buy the probes. Recently, the ICMR ordered two lakh probes from a German company to increase its testing capacity.Also, sources said, some of the world’s top companies such as Swiss multinational healthcare company Roche and South Korea’s Seegene have submitted their Covid-19 test kits to ICMR for validation. “Once the ICMR validates the kits of any of these companies and gives a go-ahead to private labs to test, we can certainly join in,” Dr Arvind Lal, chairman and managing director of Lal Pathlabs, said.He added that they have been involved in talks with government authorities on Covid-19 testing but there is no final word yet. “We have two major labs in Delhi and Kolkata where testing can be carried out. Sample collection can be done at over 100 centers across the country. We have done that before when the swine flu outbreak took place in 2009,” he said. Dr Navin Dang, who owns Dr Dang’s Lab in Delhi, also said he can start testing the day government gives permission.The Covid-19 testing in government labs is free to the public. However, to the government it costs about Rs 6,000 to Rs 6,500. In private labs, the cost of testing could be much higher. So, industry experts said, the government may have to decide on whether to allow private players to charge as per their costing model or to subsidise the rates.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74664437,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1391049,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/accredited-private-labs-to-be-allowed-to-test-for-covid-19/articleshow/74664414.cms

MUMBAI: The global sell-off triggered by fears of a worldwide recession due to the spread of coronavirus shows no signs of tapering, despite desperate cut in interest rates and other liquidity-support measures by central banks. On Monday, the sensex lost another 8%, or 2,713 points, its second worst single-day loss after the 2,919-point pounding last Thursday. And it is expected to crash again on Tuesday after the Dow Jones index in the US crashed over 12% in early trades on Monday.In less than a month, the sensex has lost nearly 10,000 points or 24%, a bear market like many other global indices.Investors’ wealth is down by about Rs 36 lakh crore during the same period.Technically, the nifty , which shed 758 points to close at 9,197, is below the crucial support level of 9,300 which is negative. The index may fall to 8,800-8,850 levels in the near term.Late on Sunday, the US central bank cut interest rate by 100 basis points (one percentage point) to 0-0.25% range, and also announced a bond buying programme worth $700 billion, that many analysts are calling quantitative easing (QE) 4. Globally, investors saw the US Fed’s steps as a desperate attempt to support the market in times of a pandemic.On Dalal Street, the day’s strong selling was led by foreign funds with a net outflow of Rs 3,800 crore. HDFC, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, RIL and Infosys contributed to more than half of the sensex’s fall. At close all the 30 of sensex’s constituents closed in the red. The crash came despite talks of a 50 basis points emergency rate cut by RBI in the evening, which did not come through. However, the central bank announced several measures to infuse liquidity into the system, aimed at supporting a sliding market.According to Shrikant Chouhan, senior VP, equity technical research, Kotak Securities, the markets traded under immense pressure of global weakness. “Failure to find a concrete solution to the corona virus and a rise in infected cases in different parts of the world have compelled market participants to liquidate their investments. To make matters worse, US futures remained in the lower circuit (during Monday’s session in India) which weighed heavily on other markets.”Outside of the index, the stock price of Yes Bank zoomed over 50% in intra-day trade and closed at Rs 37, up 45% on the day as RBI’s reorganization plan for the troubled bank took shape. However, a court case by the holders of its A-T1 bonds may hamper some of the central bank’s plans, industry people said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74664448,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1589892,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-falls-2713-points-2nd-biggest-drop-ever-has-lost-24-in-a-month/articleshow/74664445.cms

MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned Reliance Group chairman Anil Ambani for recording his statement in connection with a Rs 12,500-crore loan given by Yes Bank to the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) companies, which went bad. The ED found that during the same period, ADAG had given Rs 1,100 crore as loans to firms owned by Rana Kapoor ’s family members and suspects it was a quid pro quo arrangment.

Ambani failed to appear before ED officials on Monday due to “prior commitments”. The ED given him a second date—Thursday—to appear at their Ballard Estate office.

A Reliance Group spokesperson declined to comment on the development. Reliance Group, in a recent statement, had said that its entire debt from Yes Bank was fully secured and was availed in the ordinary course of business.

Sources stated that Yes Bank—then managed by Rana Kapoor—sanctioned loa- ns to ADAG companies till 2018, despite the fact that the group was in a financial crisis and some of its loans availed from other financial institutions turned non-performing assets (NPAs).

ADAG companies had given loans to Kapoor’s family companies in the form of debenture loan. The ED alleged that Kapoor had formed 78 companies in the nmaes of his wife Bindu and three daughters — Roshini Kapoor , Radha Kapoor Khanna , and Raakhee Kapoor Tandon . Kapoor was managing these companies on behalf of his family members and allegedly received Rs 5,000-crore bribe through these companies from various firms that had borrowed nearly Rs 20,000-crore loans from Yes Bank and later turned NPAs.

Even the flow of public transport especially auto-rickshaws has declined,” Kumar said.“Petrol price has reduced to Rs 74.31 per litre on Monday from Rs 75.65 per litre on March 7 while the price of diesel has come down to Rs 66.8 per litre from Rs 68.23 per litre. The prices are continuously dropping,” he added.Proprietor of a petrol pump at Bahadurpur, Anuj Raj, said more than 1,600 vehicles come for refilling per day. “But now it has been reduced to 950 per day. The market is slow,” he added.Ashok Kumar, owner of a petrol pump at Dak Bunglow roundabout, told this newspaper on Monday that sale of petrol has dropped by almost 40%. “We have not seen demand destruction at this level throughout the year,” he said. He added: “The only time the sale of oil went down was in September when the state government imposed the Motor Vehicles Act, 2020. The crowd on road has also thinned.”KB Gandhi, manager of a petrol pump at Buddh Marg, claimed that the sale of petrol has gone down by 38%. “Over the past three days, we have been witnessing low footfall,” he said.Analysing the reason behind the fall in oil consumption and rate reduction, economist DM Diwakar told this newspaper that the world market price of crude oil has declined to $37 per barrel from $51 per barrel. “The price of oil should be reduced further, so that the sale of petrol and diesel can increase. But due to poor economic condition of the country, the Centre did not reduce the market price,” he said.Diwakar, professor at AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies, said, “The outbreak of Covid-19 has further aggravated the economic condition of most countries. Automobile companies are facing loss and thus the sale of crude oil has declined. The other reason for reduction of sale of petro products is because slowdown of market as industries, educational institutes and other gathering places are shut owing to Covid-19.”",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74665415,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-161444,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/substantial-fall-in-petrol-diesel-sales/articleshow/74661245.cms

36,['17/03/2020'],RBI on Coronavirus: RBI unveils Rs 1L-crore liquidity infusion to fight virus effect,"MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) governor Shaktikanta Das announced a Rs 1-lakh-crore liquidity infusion for banks through a long-term repo operation (LTRO) at the central bank’s policy rate of 5.15%. It also announced a second six-month dollar-swap facility. Under this, the central bank will make available $2 billion to the forex markets for six months.“The RBI has several policy instruments at its command and stands ready to take all necessary measures to ensure that the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Indian economy are mitigated and financial markets and institutions in India continue to function normally,” said Das, announcing the special measures.While industry associations were disappointed that the RBI did not announce a mid-term revision in policy rates, bankers said that the repo will bring down interest rates.SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said, “The RBI decision to ensure additional liquidity through LTRO and swap transactions will ensure the twin objectives of further compression in term structure of interest rates and ensuring dollar liquidity.”The governor also urged members of the public to shift to digital channels for bill payments and use other electronic services like mobile banking, internet banking and cards to limit the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic by avoiding social contact and visits to bank branches.In his interaction with the media, the governor also did not rule out a mid-term rate revision. “The repo rate decision can only be taken in the MPC (monetary policy committee) meeting as per the RBI Act, but I don’t rule out anything. I am not ruling out any possibility,” Das said.“Tentative estimates of consequent loss of global growth are currently placed in the range of 0.4% to 1.5%. India is not immune to this pandemic. Covid-19 could impact economic activity in India directly through trade channels, especially in electronics, drugs, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, etc, in which the exposure to China is relatively high. The second round of effects of the pandemic could operate through a slowdown in growth in the domestic economic growth,” said Das.The governor said that the central bank would provide an assessment of the economic impact of Covid-19 in India in its monetary policy review. He said that the impact of the virus was still playing out, which required the central bank to use its firepower in a calibrated manner.“Sectors such as tourism, airlines, hospitality industry and domestic trade and transport are suffering a loss of activity. Spillovers are being transmitted through finance and confidence channels to overseas and domestic equity markets. Forex and bond markets are not immune. There is considerable uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic and the currently available estimates of its adverse effects will undergo sizeable revisions,” said Das.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74665175,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1338908,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-unveils-rs-1l-cr-liquidity-infusion-to-fight-virus-effect/articleshow/74664058.cms

SURAT: Gujarat high court has given its go-ahead for acquisition of private properties at Umara, obstructing completion of Pal-Umra bridge over Tapi river, after affected families and Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) jointly submitted final agreement on alternative land allotment on Monday.

The construction of Rs90 crore Pal-Umra bridge, which is 95% complete, got stuck after owners of about 20 houses over a 2,400 square metre land refused to vacate their properties and sought the high court’s protection four years ago.

Last week, the affected families agreed to the proposal of the civic body to provide them plots at some other place. The high court had directed both the parties to submit a final agreement on alternative land allotment for final decision on March 16.

“The high court order has paved the way for the construction of the approach end at Umara after submission of the joint agreement by the affected families and SMC on Monday. One of the affected family has not signed on the agreement, but the court has directed it to do it within seven days. The Pal-Umra bridge under phase-2 of BRTS will be completed soon and directly benefit thousands of people,” Ketan Patel, deputy municipal commissioner (town planning), said.

According to Patel, this will be the fifth bridge over Tai river connecting Adajan with Athwalines, Nanpura, Chowk Bazaar and Umra. The Pal-Umara bridge will help in reducing traffic issues at the cable-stayed bridge and Athwalines bridge.

He also expressed “disappointment” after seeing masks being distributed in the Vidhan Sabha, saying this will create more panic.A senior official said, “When the CM saw masks being distributed, he was disappointed and called JD (U) MLC Ramchandra Bharti, who had distributed those masks, to discuss the issue.”He added, “The CM was of the opinion that such activities would lead to more panic among general public.”Nitish even raised this issue inside the House. “Mask has become an issue now. One mask could be used for six to eight hours only. After using the mask it has to be properly disposed of. It should either be burnt, or buried inside the soil so that others do not get infected,” he said.Later, talking to media outside the assembly, the CM said, “It is important to be alert, but don’t frighten people. It is important to be cautious, maintain distance and avoid gathering.”Angry over the imposition of Section 144 in some districts, CM said he had asked officials to get it removed as this was also creating panic. “It is not a law and order situation and I have instructed to get it removed.

The investors include several retired people who had shifted their savings from Yes Bank’s fixed deposits to the bonds in expectation of higher returns.A retired offshore worker who had Rs 50 lakh in fixed deposits in the Yes Bank’s Kondhwa branch in Pune was approached by the bank’s relationship manager and another executive and asked to shift his savings to the bonds in 2017.“They told me that it was as secure as a fixed deposit and I would get 9.5% return instead of the 8.2% in FDs. Earlier this month, when I saw that the value of the bonds had fallen substantially, I sought reassurance that I will get back the money after five years. They told me the bonds were perpetual,” said the customer. He added that the bank staff reassured him that the bond prices would recover.Chandigarh-based Nimish Goyal’s parents had a fixed deposit with Yes Bank and, again, the bank’s relationship manager had offered them AT-1 bonds . “In our case, the bank had not disclosed the risks. The bonds were sold as a debt instrument and we thought they were safe as no one has lost money in a scheduled commercial bank in India,” said Goyal.Although these bonds are primarily sold to an institution, the bank staff sold the bond through a secondary sale. According to Goyal, the staff are incentivised for selling third-party financial products.D Gurdev, a businessman from Mohali, had a similar experience. “We were approached by the bank’s relationship manager. He even opened a demat account for investing in the bonds. When I found that the price of the bonds had fallen to Rs 42,000, I was alarmed. But the bank reassured me that I would be able to redeem my full principal amount after five years,” he said.Yes Bank on Saturday had said that it has written down Rs 8,415 crore of the Rs 8,690-crore AT-1 bonds issued. The bank has said that since the third quarter losses had turned it unviable or approaching unviability, the bonds were written down.On Monday, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that the write-down was in line with the terms of the contract between Yes Bank and investor.Last Friday, when asked about the AT-1 bonds, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the matter was in the courts and she would therefore not comment.

As part of the conspiracy, Mehta offered to take her husband Manoj (48) on a short trip saying they would party every day as the latter an alcoholic. He first took him to Chotila on March 5 and later to Junagadh, Dhari and Sasan, where he stoned Manoj to death on March 6. Manoj’s bones, torn clothes and ID card were recovered on March 12.

When her son Rajnikant inquired about his father’s whereabouts, Varsha told him on March 7 that an unidentified person had come to the house and informed that his father’s his body was lying in Gir forest near Sasan. Varsha and Rajnikant approached Aji Dam police station, whose officials called up their counterparts in Mendarada police station. Mendarada police denied having found any body. However, as Varsha insisted that the body was there, she, Rajnikant and his cousin Bipin Soni went to Mendarada police station on March 7. Officials denied having recovery of any body. Then they all went to Talala police station which also denied having found any body.

When they returned to Rajkot on the night of March 8, Varsha suggested Rajnikant that they should seek Mehta’s help as he was a census officer with the forest department. On March 9, Varsha, Rajnikant and Mehta went to Sasan, where Mehta knew the place where he had dumped the body. However, the body was not found at the spot.

Meanwhile, Soni got a call from Mendarada police station saying that they had found mortal remains of a person. The three went to Mendarada, where the cops showed them bones, torn clothes and ID card of Manoj, on the basis of which, Rajnikant ascertained his father’s identity. The mortal remains were sent for forensic postmortem in Jamnagar. “On Sunday feeling of guilt got the better of Varsha who confessed before Rajnikant that Mehta had killed his father. Rajnikant went to Mendarada police station and lodged a complaint against his mother and Mehta,” said Pradeepsinh Jadeja, Junagadh deputy superintendent of police.

The new roster has been uploaded on the court website.Last week, top judges of the high court had met and issued various directions restricting its functioning. On Monday, the court passed fresh directives after another emergency meeting of the high court’s Administrative and General Supervision Committee headed by Chief Justice D N Patel. It was attended by president Mohit Mathur and secretary Abhijat of the high court bar association to review steps taken “to contain the spread of pandemic coronavirus.”Almost similar to how the high court works during vacations, the new roster lays down that on March 17 and 19, four division benches, four single-judge benches for civil jurisdiction and three single judge benches each for criminal and original jurisdiction will hear “only urgent matters.” Similarly, on March 18 and 20, three division benches, three single-judge benches for civil jurisdiction and three single-judge benches each for criminal and original jurisdiction would function. In the normal course, a total of 26 benches sit for hearing all types of cases.The high court has also designated two joint registrars to determine which cases classify to be treated as urgent matters and listed them before the courts.Monday saw most judges sit briefly in court where they heard cases that needed immediate attention, else deferred hearing.

49,['17/03/2020'],Yes Bank will have full liquidity support: RBI governor,"RBI governor Shaktikanta Das (File photo)

MUMBAI: RBI governor Shaktikanta Das promised necessary liquidity support to Yes Bank , which will lift all withdrawal restrictions on Wednesday. The RBI had restricted withdrawals to Rs 50,000 per customer under a moratorium imposed on March 5, with the lender on the verge of failure.

Since then, SBI , HDFC and a host of private lenders have invested Rs 10,000 crore in the bank’s capital. Reassuring depositors, the RBI governor said there was no reason for them to rush to withdraw funds from the bank.

Rating agency Moody’s also upgraded Yes Bank and changed its outlook to positive citing an improved capital position. “Given the new capital raised and the additional tier-1 (quasi-equity) securities write-down, Moody’s expects Yes Bank’s solvency has improved and that the recovery rates for the banks’ depositors and senior creditors will be very high, supporting the current credit ratings,” Moody’s said.

Under the reconstruction scheme, Yes Bank investors, who hold over 100 shares, are barred from selling their shares for three years. Shares of the private bank surged 45% in thin trade to Rs 37.1 on Monday.

The governor’s assurance comes at a time when there is a concern that there will be an immediate outflow of funds from Yes Bank after the moratorium is lifted. This is the first time that a failed bank is being revived after a moratorium. Until now, all failed banks that were placed under a moratorium were eventually merged with a public bank.

Yes Bank had a flight of a third of its deposits (Rs 72,000 crore) in the five months leading to the moratorium. Terming Yes Bank’s restructuring scheme as credible and sustainable, Das said it is the first instance of public-private partnership for a revival of a private bank.

“Never in the history of banking in India depositors in a scheduled commercial bank have lost money. Their interests have always been protected. The present scheme also protects the interest of the depositors. So I once again reiterate that depositors need not worry, their money is safe. After 6pm on Wednesday they can draw their money, but there is absolutely no reason for them no need for them to go for panic withdrawal,” said Das.

Until now, the RBI had managed to prevent a run on a bank after the moratorium was lifted by providing customers with the assurance of government ownership. Das pointed out that those participating in the revival of Yes Bank are big names in the banking sector.

RAJKOT: Notorious history-sheeter Sonu Dangar and her aide Balsinh Boricha were formally arrested under the Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organized Crime (GCTOC) Act on Monday.

A special investigation team (SIT), formed by KJ Chaudhary, Savarkundla deputy superintendent of police, secured the custody of Dangar and Boricha from Vadodara Central Jail, where they were lodged as undertrial prisoners in several cases.

Earlier on March 9, nine persons including Dangar were booked under the GCTOC Act.

Apart from Dangar and her aide, Shivraj Vichhiya, Shailesh Chandu, Dadu Chandu, Ashok Boricha, Vanraj Vala, Narendra Khuman and Gautam Khuman were also booked under the act.

“Dangar was first to have been arrested under the GCTOCA in Saurashtra after the law was promulgated in Gujarat. Dangar and her co-accused are involved in crimes ranging from murder, attempt to murder and extortion to kidnapping, money laundering, land grabbing and arms dealing,” said Chaudhary.

51,['17/03/2020'],Manjhi slams RJD after denial of Rajya Sabha ticket to Kushwaha,"HAM (S) national president and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi

PATNA: HAM (S) national president and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi on Monday said that the Mahagathbandhan or Grand Alliance (GA) will fall apart after March if the RJD continued to discard the interest of its other constituents and failed to play the role of ‘badabhai’ (big brother) in true sense.

Manjhi was reacting to denial of a Rajya Sabha berth to the Congress. “The RJD had given in writing to the Congress during the seat sharing for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls that a Rajya Sabha seat will be given to the grand old party at appropriate time. However, the RJD didn’t keep its promise and proposed the names of its two candidates,” Manjhi said.

The HAM(S) chief further said the other partners of the GA had been demanding for setting up a coordination committee from the very beginning to deal with issues related to chalking out strategy to counter the NDA or launch public awareness campaign or agitations to expose the NDA rule in the state. However, nothing has happened on this front so far, he lamented.

The former CM, however, admitted that the RJD was the biggest partner in the GA, which comprised the RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM (S) and VIP. “Being the largest party, the RJD should play the role of ‘badabhai’ in true sense of the term. If the RJD continues to behave like this with its partners, the latter will have no option than to look for some alternative arrangements post March,” he told reporters in Patna.

Referring to the RJD state president Jagadanand Singh ’s statement that the party (RJD) would only toe the lines of the party supremo, Lalu Prasad , the HAM(S) national president said that the RJD would not think above him (Lalu). “He (Jagadanand Singh) has already said that those who have any objection over toeing Lalu’s line of action, were free to go anywhere. This is not the way to talk with its alliance partners,” Manjhi said.

Manjhi’s reaction came a day after RLSP chief and former union minister Upendra Kushwaha expressed his displeasure over denial of the Rajya Sabha berth to the Congress. Kushwaha, who were here to take part in a meeting of the party functionaries on Sunday, said, “This is not good in the larger interest of the GA. This is just betrayal and nothing else.”

While the two GA constituents—RSLP and HAM(S)—were vocal on the issue, Mukesh Sahni-led VIP preferred to keep mum. “I don’t think it prudent to make any official comment on the issue,” Sahni said over phone. He, however, hastened to add that important issues would be discussed at the right forum.

The state leadership of the Congress has already expressed its displeasure over the decision of the RJD not to give any Rajya Sabha seat to the grand old party. Meanwhile, a host of senior leaders of the GA, including Jitan Ram Manjhi, Upendra Kushwaha and Mukesh Sahni held a meeting in the state capital on Monday to assess the situation in the wake of recent political development.

But now session regularization by the earlier deadline is highly unlikely, say university officials.As of now, degree part-I exam of 2018-19 session is yet to begin. Ideally, by now the process for degree part-I exam of the session 2019-20 should have begun. Not only that, the first semester exam of postgraduate session 2018-20 is yet to begin.Third semester exam of the PG session 2017-19 and first semester exam of the session 2018-2020 are long overdue. Besides MU students, the PG 2017-19 exam also includes the examinees of Patliputra University (PPU), whose colleges were part of the parent MU before it was separated in March 2018. Though exact figures are not available, the number of students affected by delayed sessions is estimated to be about three lakhs.Conceding that the Covid-19 has greatly impacted the university’s exam calendar, MU VC said this was not a university specific problem as it has affected the functioning of other universities as well. “It is an unforeseen development and as such little can be done about it. We can only hope for early normalization,” said the VC.“Once the situation improves and academic activities are restored, I will try to minimize the exam-result publication gap by introducing some innovative measures,” he added.On the issue of introduction of new courses like PG diploma in Defence Studies and Chinese language study programmes, the VC said the Covid-19 is unlikely to delay the introduction of new courses.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74668068,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-628714,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mus-sessions-delay-to-affect-3l-pupils/articleshow/74661134.cms
53,['17/03/2020'],City copes with changed work schedule,"PATNA: From corporate offices to media houses, private firms to government organizations, the Covid-19 outbreak has affected the working schedule with employees being asked to follow alternate duty schedules and work-from-home options.Now, government as well as private offices have to adapt to a completely new and untested routine as per their office norm. While many people are enjoying the fact they are getting more time to spend with their families, there are psychological factors related to less social interaction and confinement within the four walls of the house.Several employees said the work-from-home schedule should be followed more often in the country. Sonal Sinha, an executive at a private firm in Boring Road, said, “I am saving travel time of two hours every day while working from home. Working from home is not just a time saver but also keeps me away from excess workload. It gives me time to spend with my family and even call my friends over for lunch.”However, others said it’s an overrated culture, which makes people less productive. “There’s nothing called working from home; you either go to office and work or don’t work at all. There are infinite distractions at home, starting from disturbances from family members to unwanted guests,” said Anup Vema, an employee of a private firm on Exhibition Road.Business employers on the other hand, said the decision of shifting work to home is a challenge. “It’s a challenge for us. However we need to trust our employees as we have hired them for a reason. We switched office work to home as soon as the state government issued several directives following the coronavirus outbreak. Even though, it was not mandatory for us to follow, we kept our employees safety as our top most priority,” said Sanjay Kumar Shekhawat, owner of a firm on Exhibition Road.Psychologists said working from home has its pros and cons, depending upon the personality of the person. Associate professor at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH), Santosh Kumar, said, at times people do not have a friendly and calming environment at their homes, hence they see work as a kind of escape. “Work-from-home can lead to headaches and even mental illnesses like depression and anxiety for such people. Another disadvantage with this is that people change their time table, including their sleeping and waking up time and eating habits. People can also lose their self-esteem and confidence with such laidback attitude,” Kumar said.Talking about the positive aspects of this lifestyle, Kumar said it can increase the productivity of people. “Working from home means not spending hours away from home and spending more time with the family. It can make them happier and add as a working fuel,” he added.Binda Singh, a clinical psychologist in the city, said keeping in mind the current global outbreak, work-from-home is much needed for employees who go out to work and meet people. “However, it gives people an opportunity to waste time and surf on the internet, especially for people who are not dedicated towards their work,” she said.She added: “Not going out or meeting colleagues can be stressful for a lot of people.”",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/city-copes-with-changed-work-schedule/articleshow/74661082.cms

The two cancer hospitals are run by Tata Memorial Centre.

Chief administrative officer of both the hospitals Madho Singh said, “A meeting was convened to discuss measures required to keep cancer patients safe from coronavirus infection.”

Assistant medical superintendent of Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital Dr Akash Anand Srivastava said, “Considering the risk of coronavirus infection, precautionary measures have been adopted for registered cancer patients and their attendants.”

He said the screening of patients would be done by a team of doctors at the main entrance of the hospital to prevent unnecessary crowd in the hospital. “Only one attendant will be allowed with a patient,” he added.

For patients whose treatment is complete, follow up will be done after April 15, 2020. In this regard, regular SMS are being sent to patients requesting them to come after April 15 for regular follow up.

Patients registered before August 1, 2019, are supposed to have completed their treatment, hence, they are being asked to come after April 30, 2020, for regular follow up.

Srivastava said cancer-related emergency services and registration of new cancer patients and treatment would continue as usual. “Patients who have been registered after August 1, 2019, will continue their follow up regularly. Among these patients, who are not undergoing active treatment are requested to come to the hospital after April 15, 2020, for follow-up,” he said.

“Patients who have any symptoms of cough and fever have been asked to avoid visiting the hospital with cancer patients and may contact district hospital or corona unit,” Srivastava said.

Surat: The three-member inquiry committee formed by municipal commissioner to investigate into the allegations of strip fitness test of women clerks at Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER) in February did not find any substantial material to prove Surat Municipal Corporation Employees’ Union’s (SMCEU) claims about it. The union had alleged in a complaint to civic authorities on February 20 that probationary women clerks were subjected to strip fitness test in group and unmarried women questioned about experience of pregnancy.

Despite not finding any evidence in the complaint, the committee has suggested improvement in fitness test at SMIMER. The committee claimed that examination of CCTV footages didn’t prove that the women were put in a humiliating condition. Notably, the CCTV cameras are installed outside the gynaecology department. Doctors of SMIMER have been instructed to be accurate while conducting fitness test of women employees and also be sensitive towards their concerns.

SMIMER doctors have been instructed to do proper counselling of women employees before carrying out fitness test. ""The committee members did not receive any specific complaint of humiliation, but some women candidates verbally told them that they did not find the test proper and were surprised since they were not informed about it in advance,"" said a senior SMC officer.

No women employees had approached the committee willingly. The committee wrote letters to department heads asking them to send probationer women employees to appear before it. At least 50 women had submitted their statements in writing.

SMCEU had alleged in its February 20 complaint that a group of 10 probationary women clerks were made to undergo a humiliating fitness test where they were asked to remove their clothes and made to stand in a room together. Unmarried women were subjected to two finger test and also asked if they had experienced pregnancy ever. The union submitted the written complaint after the women made a representation to it.

The three-member committee comprised Kalpana Desai, retired dean of SMIMER, Gayatri Jariwala, in-charge deputy commissioner, SMC, and Trupti Kalthiya, executive engineer, SMC. The committee submitted its report to SMC on Monday.

SMIMER DOESN’T HAVE APPROVED SOP ON FITNESS TEST

When TOI first reported the issue, SMIMER officials claimed that they were conducting the tests as per government rules but top officials of general administration department (GAD) in Gandhinagar claimed there are no rules as such. SMIMER’s top doctors attempted to prove what they did was right in an unofficially called press conference. It was addressed by Priti Kapadiya, in-charge superintendent of New Civil Hospital, Vandna Desai, superintendent of SMIMER, and Ashwin Vachhani, head of gynaecology department, SMIMER.

""The doctors do not have a standard operating procedure (SOP) in SMIMER,” the senior SMC officer said. ""Care will be taken in future that dignity of each patient is maintained and rules are followed strictly,"" the officer added.

Surat: Sugarcane harvesters at Pitha Padariya village in Valsad taluka of Valsad district were shocked to see two leopard cubs in the field on Sunday. The labourers, who were working in the sugarcane farm owned by Jesingbhai Patel, immediately called up local forest department.

“As soon as we received the information about the leopard cubs, our staff rescued them. The 20-day-old cubs were found to be healthy. We placed both the cubs in the same agricultural fields from where their mother took them away in the night,” Yuvrajsinh Zala, assistant conservator of forests, Dharampur sub-division, Valsad north forest division, told TOI.

“Leopards like to hide in the sugarcane fields. Labourers often find leopards and cubs in sugarcane fields during the harvest season,’’ Zala added. Forest officials say sugarcane fields have become natural habitat for leopards in south Gujarat.

According to leopard census carried out in the state in 2016, there were 18 leopards in Valsad district. The census recorded about 1,395 leopards in the state.

Two leopard cubs were found charred to death in a sugarcane farm at Pipariya village of Mandvi taluka in Surat district on March 15. The cubs were over two months old.

60,['17/03/2020'],Diamond industry stakeholders to discuss shutdown today,"Surat: The world's largest diamond cutting and polishing centre in Surat is staring at a possible shutdown after Israel and Antwerp announced suspension of diamond trading activities as a precaution to check spread of coronavirus.

Surat Diamond Association (SDA) has convened an emergency meeting of diamond industry stakeholders to take a call on shutdown on Tuesday.

Industry sources said all the four diamond bourses in Antwerp trading halls- Antwerp Diamond Bourse, Antwerpsche Diamantkring, Diamond Club of Antwerp and Vrije Diamnthandel - have been closed from Monday till further notice.

Antwerp and Israel are two important diamond trading centres directly connected with Surat and Mumbai. Small and medium diamond units procure their rough diamond supplies from diamond traders in Antwerp. It is estimated that about 30% of rough diamonds out of total $19 billion imported into the country come from Antwerp.

Surat Diamond Association (SDA) president Babu Kathiriya told TOI, “About 50% of polished diamonds cut and polished in Surat are passed from Antwerp to different parts of the world. As the trading activity has been shut in both Antwerp and Israel, we have convened an emergency meeting of industry stakeholders to decide on the future course of action.”

Kathiriya added, “Majority of diamond units have reduced working hours from 12 hours to eight hours and many are keeping their units shut on weekends to control diamond production. However, shutting down the entire industry would create job issues for 5.5 lakh diamond workers.”

Surat Diamond Brokers’ Association president Nandlal Pandav said, “Trading of diamonds at both Varachha and Mahidhapura markets has been reduced to just 40% as markets in China and Hong Kong are shut. Diamond merchants’ community will follow the unanimous decision taken at Tuesday’s meeting.”

Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council regional chairman Dinesh Navadia said, “Lakhs of workers in diamond industry are at the risk because of coronavirus. We are concerned about health of workers at large. Though big diamond companies are taking enough precautions, small and medium diamond units may not be taking steps to control the spread of virus.”

63,['17/03/2020'],Telcos had small army to help assess AGR dues,"Reeba Zachariah | TNN

Mumbai: Even as private cellular service operators scrambled to clear the adjusted gross revenue ( AGR ) dues before the Supreme Court’s hearing on March 17, hundreds of people have worked behind the scenes.

They assisted companies such as Vodafone Idea , Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices in carrying out a self-assessment of their past revenue to calculate their liability exposure to the telecom department.

Such was the pressure that the number of people engaged in the exercise exceeded the strength of staff in some of the new-age companies, including WhatsApp India.

About 200 people from audit firm EY verified each and every bill of Tata Teleservices in the last one-and-a-half years to assess the company’s liabilities, said a top Tata executive. “It was a mammoth task to evaluate arrears, interest and other costs spread over the past several years,” the executive added.

Likewise, an EY team also assisted Vodafone Idea in examining heaps of records and in doing the AGR arithmetic for the telecom operator. This is the first time that such a large number of people have been engaged in the AGR exercise. Usually, about 50 people from an audit firm assist a blue-chip company with its financial statement audits.

Following the assessments, the private mobile service operators submitted a detailed report of their AGR computations to the telecom department. Their estimates, however, are far lower than the demand raised by the government.

The AGR dues were calculated from fiscals 2007 to 2019 with interest running up to February 2020. The numbers are based on the Supreme Court’s definition of AGR, which states it should include all revenues of a cellular service operator.

The telecom department has started examining the private telcos’ self-assessed AGR claims for any deviation in computation of the dues. The entire process will take at least six months, given the volume of documents spread over multiple years that have to be evaluated, according to government officials.

Tata Teleservices has paid Rs 4,197 crore to the telecom department following its assessment, which is much lower than the government’s estimate of Rs 13,823 crore. Vodafone Idea, a company created through the merger of British telecom player Vodafone’s Indian arm and Aditya Birla Group ’s Idea Cellular, estimated its liability to be at Rs 21,533 crore, which is just about 40% of the over Rs 53,000-crore demand raised by the government. Vodafone Idea has paid Rs 6,854 crore.

Bharti Airtel has paid Rs 18,000 crore as against the government’s calculation of Rs 35,000 crore.

The report stated that the departments concerned accepted the underassessment and other deficiencies of Rs2,353.28 crore in 1830 cases. It further stated that the departments reported recovery of Rs29.77 crore in 416 cases between April 2017 and July 2019.

The audit report related to state finances stated that Bihar achieved the target of revenue surplus but not of the ratio of outstanding debt to Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). On the positive side, revenue receipts in 2017-18 increased by Rs11,862 crore (11%) over 2016-17, but were lower than the budget estimates by Rs19,711 crore.

Elaborating on the rush of expenditure by the government department towards the end of the fiscal 2017-18, the report stated that out of total expenditure of Rs25,196.70 crore by 18 departments, Rs19,664 crore (78.04%) was incurred during the last quarter, whereas Rs18,549.06 crore (73.62%) was incurred in the month of March 2018 only.

With regard to public expenditure, the report stated that the ratio of development expenditure, social services expenditure, capital expenditure and educational services to aggregate expenditure was higher than the average for the ‘general category’ states. However, the share of education in aggregate expenditure dropped in 2017-18 over the four-year period, while the share of health to aggregate expenditure is less than the average for ‘general category’ states.

With regard to incomplete projects, the report stated that out of 127 projects with estimated cost of Rs1,819.64 crore due for completion during 2011-12 to 2017-18, costs were revised only for three projects. Details of the remaining 124 projects with estimated cost of Rs1,798.64 crore were not furnished by the departments.

With regard to investments, the audit report stated that the state government incurred a notional loss of Rs3,479.32 crore on account of differences between the government’s borrowing cost and return on investment in various entities.

It further stated that 80-85% of the borrowed funds were utilized for repayment of loans and interest thereon, which implies that the state was spending less on development activities.

With regard to Goods & Services Tax (GST), which was introduced on July 1, 2017, the audit report stated that surveys and inspection were not conducted to identify eligible tax payers, who did not migrate or got registered under GST. As a result, 59,493 dealers (25.26%) out of 2,35,563 existing ones did not migrate to the new format till October 2018. This included 726 existing dealers having a turnover of Rs20 lakh or more during 2016-17 and Rs5 lakh or more during the last quarter of fiscal 2017-18.

69,['17/03/2020'],3 yrs of U’khand govt: How did agri minister fare?,"Subodh Uniyal

Dehradun: How have the last three years been for the agriculture and horticulture sector in Uttarakhand ? An overview of the performance of agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal shows that while there have been some efforts by the agriculture department to increase crop productivity and improve the lot of the state’s farmers, much more needs to be done to prevent shrinking of agricultural land, protect farms from being attacked by wild animals and ensure that benefits of government schemes reach farmers.

Among the works initiated by Uniyal and his department in the last three years include providing interest-free loans to over 2.6 lakh farmers, having a Nursery Act in place, creating clusters to promote traditional farming, amendment of Mandi Act to help farmers sell produce directly in mandi and facilitating e-agriculture trading among others. The state was also awarded the Krishi Karman award — which carried a cash prize of Rs 5 crore for good performance in the agriculture sector — by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year

However, agri experts say that the agriculture minister and his team have failed to address some basic issues plaguing farmers in the Himalayan state.

Veteran agriculturist and founder of Beej Bachao Andolan, a movement to preserve seeds among farmers of Uttarakhand, told TOI, “Our farms are being constantly devastated by wild animals and villages in several hill districts, especially Pauri, are being abandoned and virtually all agricultural activity has come to a standstill. The government has not done enough to reverse this situation.”

Jagmohan Singh, a farmer from Yamuna valley's Naugaun region in Uttarkashi district, while appreciating some schemes of the department — like the farm machinery bank scheme which enables farmers to buy modern machines in subsidised rates — told TOI that certain primary issues needed to be addressed on priority. “There is still non-availability of government mandi in hill districts, due to which farmers are not getting correct prices of their crop. Moreover, the menace of monkey, wild boar, bear and other wild animals is increasing day by day, and these animals continue to damage crop.”

Further, data of the agriculture department for 2018-19 indicates that agricultural area in the state has declined from 4.63 lakh hectares in 2017-18 to 4.49 lakh hectares in 2018-19.

Agriculture minister Uniyal when queried about this, said, “The shrinking agriculture land is mainly due to growing urbanisation and people moving out of villages. Despite land shrinking, our production has gone up.”

He added that several schemes have been started for agriculturists. ”Earlier, apple growers of Uttarkashi district were packing apples in boxes of other states. But we are now providing them corroborated boxes. This year, we provided them 1.83 lakh boxes and next season, we will provide them even more.”

However, apple farmer from Ganga valley's Sukki village Mohan Singh Rana alleged that the department’s schemes look good in papers but are not effective on ground, due to lack of implementation and loopholes. “For example, take the insurance scheme floated by the government. After introduction of new apple varieties, farmers can grow nearly 500 to 1,000 trees in one hectare land, but the scheme provided by the government allows insurance of only 278 apple trees in one hectare land, leaving maximum crop uninsured. In case of damage from hail storm, insurance companies provide only 20 percent compensation, even in case of complete loss.”

He added that the pesticides, manure and other medicines provided by government agencies are of low quality, due to which farmers were being forced to buy costly medicines from private firms.

SURAT: Top officials of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) said they would from now on ensure, “No two finger test or pregnancy test of an unmarried woman is done” during medical examination for confirmation in job. They said this despite the inquiry committee not finding substantial evidence or statements proving the allegations of Surat Municipal Corporation Employees’ Union (SMCEU) that women employees were allegedly subjected to strip test during their medical examination.

The union in its complaint had claimed that unmarried women clerks were asked by doctors about past pregnancies, pregnancy tests and if they had missed their menstrual cycle. SMCEU had alleged in its complaint on February 20 that a group of 10 probationary women clerks were made to undergo humiliating fitness test where they were asked to remove their clothes and made to stand in a room together. Unmarried women were subjected to two finger test and also asked if they had experienced pregnancy ever.

“Top officials of SMC have instructed doctors of SMIMER not to undertake pregnancy test of unmarried women. The women will not have to undergo two finger test as well,” said A K Naik, deputy commissioner (Health), SMC.

However, SMIMER will continue to do two finger test and pregnancy test of newly recruited married women. “The two finger test of married women will help the doctors to find out if they are suffering from cancer or any other disease. Past record of married women about pregnancy is also required as a part of medical examination since they are being employed by SMC,” Naik said.

“We have clearly instructed doctors to maintain the dignity of all women. They should be accurate and proper while conducting medical examination,” municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani said.

MUMBAI: Investors, especially high net worth individuals (HNIs), lost heavily in the highly oversubscribed SBI Cards and Payment Services IPO as its shares were listed at a 13% discount to the offer price of Rs 755 and also closed below that price as broader markets crashed again on Monday.

On the BSE, the scrip was listed at Rs 655 and closed at Rs 683, while on the NSE, it was listed at Rs 661 and closed at Rs 678. On the NSE, over 6 crore shares were traded, while on the BSE, nearly 42 lakh shares changed hands.

In the run-up to the IPO’s opening, SBI Cards shares commanded a premium of Rs 100-150 in the grey market, indicating a listing price of Rs 850-900. However, as the Covid-19 pandemic led to a sell-off in the global markets, including in India, the premium vanished and it was in the negative territory before the listing.

The Rs 10,350-crore offer, the largest float in two years, was subscribed over 26 times. However, as the IPO closed, applications from Yes Bank were in doubt as the RBI put restrictions on the private lender, including an upper limit to withdrawals. Also, as markets fell, a large number of retail investors withdrew their applications.

Market players said HNIs had bid in the IPO with borrowed money. The quantum of loss per share will depend on the rate of interest they paid to the lenders, brokers said.

SBI Cards CEO Hardayal Prasad said the management was not disappointed with the company’s stock market debut. “Contrary to the way the markets have performed in the last few days, we have responded strongly.” SBI Cards expects the restrictions placed on travel, theatres and entertainment outlets amid the spread of the coronavirus will impact its business.

PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar said in assembly on Monday that the state government is providing compensation of Rs13,500 per hectare to farmers, who have faced crop damages due to untimely rains and hail in February.

“A sum of Rs 60crore has already been sanctioned for providing agriculture input subsidy to farmers against damages to crops on 31,929 hectares of land due to untimely rainfall and hail from February 24 to 26. Affected farmers are being provided input subsidy at the rate of Rs13,500 per hectare after verification,” the CM said.

“Reports of damage to standing crops have been received from almost all 38 districts due to untimely rain from March 4 to 6 and March 13 to 15. The agriculture department is doing a detailed survey of the damages caused to the crops. Accordingly, distribution of agriculture input subsidy to farmers will start at the earliest,” the CM Nitish was quoted in a statement issued by the state information of public relations department (IPRD).

Sources in the agriculture department said that the damaged crops, included pulses, potato, lentils and wheat among others. Most of these crops have reached the stage of grain formation and their upper body was comparatively heavier. Thus high speed winds accompanied by showers and hail flattened the crops. Besides, the accumulated water damaged the harvested crops, which were undergoing thrashing.

Agriculture minister Prem Kumar said the assessment of crops damaged by the two rounds of March rains would be made in 24 hours and agriculture subsidy would be paid in the next 25 days after the verification of the online claims made by the farmers concerned.

In a bid to ensure timely compensation to the farmers this time as well, the state agriculture department has sought report from all 38 districts on assessment of damages to standing crops. Districts officials have also been asked to conduct surveys to assess damages to the standing crops.

Agriculture input subsidy is paid to farmers at the rate of Rs 6,500 per hectare for unirrigated or rain-fed land and Rs 13,500 per hectare for irrigated land, with a maximum cap of two hectares of land.

The students urged the authorities to speed up the procedure to facilitate their travel back home from coronavirus-hit Italy.

The students in Rome complained that they were being made to wait for undergoing the coronavirus test and stay back until the reports arrive from India. “We should at least be told how many days the procedure will take. There is no information as to when a flight will be arranged to fly us to India,” a student from Andhra Pradesh said in a video posted online.

A large number of students at Milan had to wait as they were initially informed that they will have to undergo mandatory coronavirus test. Air India informed them that only if they had the medical certificate to confirm they tested negative for coronavirus they would be able to board the flight. Later, the flights too got cancelled.

“We are in quarantine,” a Telugu student told TOI from Delhi after the government brought them back from Milan. They were not required to undergo any test at Milan but the necessary check-up was done on their arrival.

The Indian embassy in Rome, however, has informed students and Indian national desiring to return to India that undergoing the test was compulsory and this is also being facilitated by the embassy.

“We seek your understanding, cooperation and patience that these precautionary measures have been taken to ensure maximum safety for you and your family members,” the Indian embassy in Italy conveyed to a student in response to a video posted by this reporter on Twitter. “The student underwent Covid-19 medical test at the Indian embassy, Rome, organised from March 13 to 15 by the government of India which sent an Indian medical team for screening Indian students,” the embassy said.

The student said they were not getting any information about the flight. He said they were also facing a problem of getting food.

The Indian embassy staff in Italy told TOI that all students who attended the screening have been told that it would take a minimum of one week for the test results to be obtained from India. “The mandatory quarantine period will be followed,” the embassy said.

A Telugu student said they had come to the Rome airport on March 10 but have been stranded there since then as there were no flights.

88,['17/03/2020'],Civic whip in Mumbai: Offices ordered to work at 50% of capacity,"Bombay municipal corporation (File Photo)

MUMBAI: The BMC has directed all non-essential service providers to work at 50% capacity. The state government has asked the other municipal corporations to issue similar orders to keep crowds at a minimum, mainly by discouraging commuting for work.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had last week appealed to offices to allow staff to work from home. On Monday, he appealed to people to avoid travelling or taking public transport unless absolutely necessary. “The Centre has repeatedly told us to avoid crowds and I am asking all offices to allow working from home,” said Thackeray.

BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi said, “I have issued an order directing offices in Mumbai to not work at more than 50% capacity. But all essential services will work at full capacity.”

He said organisations can allow for the remaining 50% staff to work from home and in some cases ask them to come to work alternatively.

The order has been issued under section 10 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, which empowers municipal commissioners to take measures to curb the spread of disease, in the present instance Covid-19. The circular says that disobeying the order will lead to action under the IPC’s section 188 (disobedience of an order duly promulgated by a public servant), which has a punishment provision of six months’ jail or fine or both. The government has also appealed to people not to crowd places like beaches and gardens.

Health minister Rajesh Tope said a similar advisory will be issued for the entire state. The central government too on Monday advised states to go for social-distancing.

The Centre on Monday proposed detailed social distancing measures that included urging states to close schools, universities, theatres, swimming pools, gyms and museums till March 31 and asking private-sector organisations and employers to allow employees to work from home, wherever feasible. It also advised that meetings, as far as feasible, should be done through video-conferencing.

Thackeray has asked some secretaries to explore how the state can deal with economic losses due to the partial shutdown and businesses getting affected.

A senior IAS officer said that large government offices like Mantralaya too should be included in the rule as it is owing to large offices that far too many people travel from across the city on crowded trains to get to work.

Meanwhile, many firms have already taken steps towards social distancing. The 15,000-strong professional services firm PwC has mandated that everybody has to work from home as a norm. Having already curbed domestic and international travel, PwC has asked its partners to visit client locations only if there’s an exceptional need to do so. In case employees have to urgently visit the office, they have been told to strictly avoid public transport, with the company saying it will reimburse cab travel for such emergency visits. The firm has asked employees to not undertake personal visits either. The firm has also informed employees that their medical leaves during the period will not be deducted from the annual leave balance.

KPMG in India has a work-from-home option this week. The firm has informed employees that there will be reimbursement for WiFi dongles for everyone of rank assistant manager and below. Managers and above already have WiFi dongles. Employees have been told that all official travel through app-based cabs would be reimbursed whenever required. The company has provided technology support for remote working.

Smaller firms too are allowing staff to work from home.

All employees of MS Ventures, a financial planning firm in Mumbai, including the founders, are working from home. Founder-partner Mukund Seshadri said, “My concern with this is not just employees. All of them have a senior citizen at home and it’s not worth the risk. Our dock boys also are at home. Only in case of a dire emergency will they venture out to pick up documents. We don’t want the slightest chance of anybody, including clients, getting infected.”

On Monday, the sensex lost another 8%, or 2,713 points —its second worst single-day loss after the 2,919-point pounding last Thursday. And it is expected to crash again on Tuesday after the Dow Jones index in the US crashed over 12% in early trades on Monday.In less than a month, the sensex has lost nearly 10,000 points or 24%, a bear market like many other global indices.Investors’ wealth is down by about Rs 36 lakh crore during the same period.Technically, the nifty, which shed 758 points to close at 9,197, is below the crucial support level of 9,300 which is negative. The index may fall to 8,800-8,850 levels in the near term.Late on Sunday, the US central bank cut interest rate by 100 basis points (one percentage point) to 0-0.25% range, and also announced a bond buying programme worth $700 billion, that many analysts are calling quantitative easing (QE) 4. Globally, investors saw the US Fed’s steps as a desperate attempt to support the market in times of a pandemic.On Dalal Street, the day’s strong selling was led by foreign funds with a net outflow of Rs 3,800 crore. HDFC, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, RIL and Infosys contributed to more than half of the sensex’s fall. At close all the 30 of sensex’s constituents closed in the red. The crash came despite talks of a 50 basis points emergency rate cut by RBI in the evening, which did not come through. However, the central bank announced several measures to infuse liquidity into the system, aimed at supporting a sliding market.According to Shrikant Chouhan, senior VP, equity technical research, Kotak Securities, the markets traded under immense pressure of global weakness. “Failure to find a concrete solution to the corona virus and a rise in infected cases in different parts of the world have compelled market participants to liquidate their investments. To make matters worse, US futures remained in the lower circuit (during Monday’s session in India) which weighed heavily on other markets.”Outside of the index, the stock price of Yes Bank zoomed over 50% in intra-day trade and closed at Rs 37, up 45% on the day as RBI’s reorganization plan for the troubled bank took shape.

These poor-quality masks are being sold in the market for Rs 50 to 100. According to doctors, wearing such masks can cause health issues. These masks are neither sanitized nor prepared following mandatory norms.

These masks are being sold at shops and footpath on MR road, Bhagwan Talkies crossing, Bijlighar, vicinity of Taj Mahal and other monuments. These masks have neither packaging or manufacturing date nor any other specification.

Bodla resident Vimal Gupta said, “I am not able to get branded mask at a reasonable price. Some of the shops I visited are selling the N-95 mask for Rs 500. Therefore, I had to purchase a non-branded mask for Rs 80.”

President of Agra chemist association Ashu Sharma said, “Reports of the spread of coronavirus have created panic among the citizens. Demand for masks has significantly increased. People should not purchase masks without proper packaging.”

Head of TB and chest diseases department at SN Medical College Dr Santosh Kumar said, “Wearing N-95 mask can be useful in protecting a person from bacteria and virus. The masks sold on roads and without packaging are of no use. They may cause infection.”

Drug inspector Rajkumar Sharma said, “We are doing rounds of the markets and talking to shopkeepers, wholesalers and customers. There is shortage of N-95 masks in the city but shopkeepers can't charge more than the maximum retail price. We are also trying to put a tab on sale of masks manufactured in violation of norms. People should not purchase such masks”.

In fact, the education department has served notices to 10 schools in the city for defying government orders.

“Notices have been issued to the schools and enforced closure. Further action is being initiated against them for disobeying government instruction,” said a statement issued by the special chief secretary to the education department.

Some schools in other parts of the state, including Kendriya Vidyalas, also conducted classes as per schedule.

MA&UD minister KT Rama Rao and education minister Sabitha Indra Reddy were flooded with complaints on Twitter following which the ministers directed the concerned schools to follow orders.

“Will request Education Minister Smt @SabithaindraTRS Garu to advise & direct all school managements to close institutions fully,” read a tweet by KTR. Responding to it, Reddy tweeted, “Informed to Special Chief Secretary (Education) and requested to take strict action on the managements, who are not obeying the government orders.”

Meanwhile, members of Telangana Recognised School Managements Association (TRSMA), however, said that many schools had to remain partially open as students are yet to take their SSC hall tickets and closing down completely will only create panic.

“In Hyderabad, hall tickets were sent to schools only on Saturday. So, to distribute them to SSC students, many schools remained partially open, but classes were not conducted. The managements also had to relieve teachers so that they can take up invigilator duties for the SSC examination,” said TRSMA president S Srinivas Reddy.

The higher education department also found a few colleges violating orders. Many teachers were asked to report to work due to lack of clarity on whether institutions are shut only for students or for teachers as well. “Are teachers immune to Covid-19 that we are asked to report?” questioned a teacher of a private engineering college in Gajwel.

“While our college declared holidays for first year students, it did not do so for second, third and final year,” said Prasad Govardana, a student of SR Engineering College in Warangal.

Although the commissionerate of collegiate and technical education department did not receive any complaint against colleges violating norms, it clarified that teachers might be called in for maintenance of the college.

Students and teachers have flooded social media with complaints against managements forcing them to report to the institution.

According to officials, funds worth lakhs have been embezzled under this government scheme.

Under PMMVY, the government gives cash incentive of Rs 5,000 to pregnant women and lactating mothers for the first living child, in three instalments. The money is directly transferred to the bank account of the beneficiary as part of maternity benefit programme.

Sources said when a few illegal beneficiaries received the money, locals lodged complaint with local health officials. On receiving complaint, medical officer in-charge of community health centre in Majhgavan, Dr Vaibhav Rathore, conducted a preliminary investigation in the matter along with Dr Sushil Verma and health education officer Rakesh Dixit.

Rathore told TOI, “During preliminary investigation, we found that nearly 40 women in Kundariya Faizlapur village and around 20 cases in Musharafpur village wrongly got cash incentive under PPPVY. The cash was transferred in the bank accounts of illegal beneficiaries in connivance with ASHA workers, block programme manager and data entry operator. The work of ASHA workers is to identify beneficiaries who are going to have their first child while block programme manager has to verify all entries received under this scheme.”

Rathore added that they submitted the report of their preliminary investigation to the CMO for further investigation and action in the matter.

Sources said a total of 198 women in Kundariya Faizlapur village and 68 women in Musharafpur have received cash incentive of Rs 5000 in the last five months under this scheme. However, sources said officials in Mahgavan block have found nearly 60 cases of fraud under PMMVY in two villages but the actual number could be much higher in the block or district.

Dr Vineet Shukla, CMO, said, “I have directed additional chief medical officer Dr RN Giri to probe the matter and submit a report on it. We will take further action accordingly.”

MADURAI: Construction work on the Convention Centre in Tamukkam Grounds proposed by the Madurai Corporation at a cost of Rs 45.55 crore began on Monday with workers beginning to dismantle the existing auditorium structure and digging a pit.

The centre will be a first-of-its-kind facility for Madurai from the government sector and facilitate conducting of various events and meetings.

Corporation commissioner S Visakan said that it is planned to be completed in a year’s time, so that the ground will be ready to host next year’s Chithirai festival. “Although the contractor has been given 18 months’ time, we are planning to complete the work before April next year. The contractor has been asked to complete the work at the earliest. We will monitor the progress at regular intervals,” he said.

Recently, a few activists and elected representatives raised concern over utilising Tamukkam ground for construction activities. They said that it will ruin the ground, which is a historically important one.

Countering their argument, a higher official from the corporation said that there is no heritage structure in the ground. They are constructing a building by only replacing the existing auditorium and no new structure is being introduced there.

While the ground measures to an area of 9.68 acres, construction is to come up in only 2.47 acres. The remaining ground will be available for Chithirai festival and other regular activities.

“The Tamil Annai statue and idol of Swami Sankaradas will not be touched for the construction activities. Those who raise concerns in the name of heritage and culture are doing it due to some ulterior motive,” the official added.

The facility will have larger space for parking to accommodate 500 cars and more than 700 two-wheelers. There will be seven halls, which can be used according to requirement and crowd.

A small event with 200 people can be conducted in one of the halls or all halls can be joined together to host a bigger event with participation of up to 3,500 people, officials said.

Officials of state Animal Husbandry Department had approached the Pune police on February 19 to lodge a complaint in this regard with the cybercrime police station.

Joint police commissioner Ravindra Shisve said, “There were two videos which appealed to people not to consume chicken, eggs or other meat as they were behind the spread of Covid–19. These were unscientific videos but were uploaded by the arrested man and the questioned minor without doing a background check.”

According to the Animal Husbandry Department officials, the poultry industry incurred a loss of around Rs 6,000 crore in the last two months, with fake and misleading videos linking contagion spread with poultry products playing a huge role in it.

Shisve identified the arrested as Mohammed Abdul Sattar. A team comprising deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Sambhaji Kadam and inspector Jayram Paygude tracked down the IP addresses of the electronic devices used to upload and circulate the misleading videos.

The minor boy used his aunty’s cellphone to upload the video, while Sattar used his smartphone to upload the videos on his video channel, Shisve said, adding that the police would soon file a chargesheet against the man.

Recently, Shobha and Virendra returned to their house in Baradari area but her father and cousins were not happy with them returning to live in the locality and attacked the couple on March 10.

Shobha said, “My husband and in-laws are repeatedly threatened by my father and cousins and we have requested police to intervene and provide us security. My entire family is stressed and not able to concentrate on work.”

“We are trying to see if this matter could be resolved through counselling because it is mainly a family dispute. I have asked local police outpost in-charge to call both the families for a meeting. We may file an FIR only if required,” said inspector Naresh Tyagi, SHO Baradari.

Villagers immediately informed the Asha workers who intervened, but when he didn’t listen to their request for voluntary social isolation, the local panchayat sought police help.On the other hand, there was sudden panic at Thiruvarppu panchayat in Kottayam, on Saturday evening when a person who had been advised 28 days home quarantine, as he was the primary contact of a Covid-19 patient, appeared at the neighbourhood market claiming that he was bored. The panchayat members and local health officials were called in. When asked, the man simply said, “I have no symptoms. I can’t infect anyone”. Since March 9, about 157 people in the village of about 23,000 people have been quarantined.Despite state government’s clear rationale behind social isolation, appeals to altruism by reminding public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society, daily calls asking about their well-being and ensuring that sufficient supplies are provided, there are still many who violate the home quarantine guidelines.“Our focus is to minimise the community spread. But there are people who still go about when they should be home quarantined. It is a delicate situation,” said Dr Amar Fettle, state nodal officer (public emergency), currently in charge of anti-Covid-19 effort.About 10% of the total 13,696 calls received on Disha helpline for Covid-19 since January 22 are complaints from either neighbours or relatives about those who violate home quarantine. In less than a week from March 11 to March 16, the number of people under surveillance at home increased from 1,116 to 12,470 and the success of the arrangement is crucial in the fight against the spread of Covid-19. Despite the best of efforts, health officials admit that there are people who violate home quarantine guidelines.“Most of the complaints we received are about how despite being put in home quarantine and asked to stay in a well-ventilated room, some of them are seen moving around in their vehicle in busy areas,” said Akhila V Nair, manager, Disha call centre.The local authorities said that counselling is the key and rigid penal action may not really help in the long run. “We have been constantly sensitizing the neighbourhood as well as those home quarantined. People have now realised that the whole effort is ensuring that we curb the community spread of coronavirus ,” said E G Surendran, president, Mathilakam panchayat in Thrissur, where the first Covid-19 case was detected in the country. Now, one more person has tested positive in the village and 150 villagers are home quarantined.The Ernakulam district collector on Monday had a meeting with the district police commissioner, in which it was decided that policemen would go to the homes of those in quarantine to ensure that they are strictly following the guidelines. “People who come from abroad are eager to go out, meet their relatives and friends rather than ensure that they don’t spread the infection,” said an official.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74670101,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-181546,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/youre-not-in-jail-but-in-the-comfort-of-home/articleshow/74662782.cms

At least 5,000 tourists were asked to return from the toll plaza, which is about 30km from Puri.The district administration, however, has not ordered immediate evacuation of tourists who are already in Puri so far.“Our intention is not to create panic among tourists. For their own safety and prevention of the spread of the killer virus, our joint teams comprising officials of the road transport, police and health departments inspected the vehicles at the toll plaza. Tourists were requested to cancel their Puri tours and return home,” district collector (Puri) Balwant Singh told TOI.The restriction angered many tourists, who had checked into hotels in Puri and gone for sightseeing in Bhubaneswar, covering a distance of only 60km. “We have put up in a hotel in Puri. Strangely, we were not being allowed to return to Puri. With great difficulty, we managed to convince the officials, who allowed us to enter our hotel. The administration should have made prior announcement before imposing such restrictions or sealing the routes,” Jayanto Dey, a tourist from Bengal’s Howrah said, said.Singh said, “We have asked hoteliers to keep a close watch on the tourists, especially foreigners, and their health conditions.

111,['17/03/2020'],"No floor test, Speaker adjourns MP assembly over Covid-19","Bhopal: The Kamal Nath government on Monday dodged a floor test and hoped to get a 10-day breather in the ongoing political crisis when Speaker N P Prajapati adjourned the assembly till March 26 in view of the Coronavirus threat. The House will now reconvene on the day of Rajya Sabha election.

BJP promptly moved Supreme Court, seeking disqualification of the Congress government for ignoring the Governor’s instruction to conduct a floor test, and paraded its 106 MLAs at Raj Bhawan. Soon after this, Governor Lalji Tandon wrote to CM Nath, asking him to hold the floor test on March 17. “Otherwise, it will be considered that you don’t have majority,” the Governor cautioned.

The countdown to the budget session was full of suspense and drama. In the wee hours of Sunday, Tandon had asked the Speaker to conduct a floor test on Monday. Congress ministers argued that it was a “message and not a directive” from the Governor. CM Nath met the Governor around midnight on Sunday and told reporters that it’s for the Speaker to decide on floor test.

Congress MLAs flew down from Jaipur on Sunday morning and BJP MLAs from Manesar landed in Bhopal at 2.15am on Monday. The stage was set.

The House commenced at 11am. The Coronavirus divide was clear. Most Congress MLAs including chief minister Kamal Nath were seen wearing masks. BJP legislators didn’t.

Soon after the Governor’s address, Tandon gave a message to the House: “I want to give legislators some advice. With the present situation in the state, peacefully and with dedication, ensure that the rules of the Constitution and democratic traditions of Madhya Pradesh are upheld and protected.”

Leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava stood up to speak and attract the attention of the Governor but ruckus ensued immediately. Congress MLAs shouted, “Respect what the Governor said just now.”

With the exit of the Governor from the House, Bhargava said that 22 Congress MLAs had sent their resignations on March 10. “The Kamal Nath government is in minority,” he said, and demanded a floor test. He reminded that the Governor has instructed the government for a floor test.

While Bhargava was speaking, Speaker Prajapati carried on with the business of the House. Ruckus ensued and Bhargava continued to speak on the resignations of the Congress MLAs.

Speaker Prajapati told the LOP, “Please sit down. Whatever letters (including resignations of MLAs) have been exchanged were with the Governor. Not in the assembly and with Speaker.” As Bhargava tried to argue, fresh uproar started and Speaker adjourned the House for 10 minutes.

The House gathered again at 11:35am. Bhargava and former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan again said that the government “is in minority”. Chief minister Kamal Nath was present in the House.

Amid noisy scenes, the Speaker said, “Honourable members, we are aware of the Coronavirus epidemic. There is concern at the international level, including WHO. The government of India has also issued advisories from time to time and almost all state governments — including Madhya Pradesh — have taken steps to fight the epidemic. All of you must be aware that Rajasthan, Kerala, Odisha and Maharashtra have postponed their assembly sessions to check the spread of the epidemic.”

The Prime Minister hs declared it an epidemic during video conferencing with SAARC countries, Prajapati pointed out. “Legislators and people have been advised not to attend public gatherings, which is not possible due to the assembly session and hence, in view of the Government of India advisory and in public interest, the assembly is being adjourned till March 26,” he announced.

After the adjournment, and even after Congress MLAs left, BJP MLAs continued to sit in the House for around 15 minutes. Then, they boarded two buses and 106 of them went to Raj Bhavan to be presented before the Governor. “We are here to submit a list of 106 BJP MLAs to the Governor and tell him that the Congress government is in minority,” Bhargava said.

Former BJP minister Bhupendra Singh said, “We have paraded 106 party MLAs before the Governor. All of us told the Governor that his instructions of a floor test on Monday have not been followed by the Speaker.”

Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan argued, “Congress has run away from the battlefield. This government does not have the Constitutional status to be in power. Congress has shrunk to 92 MLAs and BJP had 106 present before the Governor. Majority are with BJP. Today, Congress ran away, so they can get some extra time. But this government cannot save themselves with the Coronavirus excuse. Even Coronavirus cannot save them. We are approaching Supreme Court.”

112,['17/03/2020'],"Now, another tiger takes refuge in Bareilly’s defunct rubber factory","Bareilly: An abandoned rubber factory campus, 18 km from Bareilly city, seems to attract big cats -- be it tigers or a leopard. Nearly two years after a sub-adult tiger was tranquilized and shifted elsewhere, another adult tiger has made the area its home for nearly 10 days. Forest officials on Monday confirmed its presence on the premises after camera traps installed there captured its image.

Apart from tigers, a leopard had also lived here for almost two years and forest officials suspect that it was same big cat which was run over by a heavy vehicle on February 24 on road outside the factory.

Though Bareilly has social forestry, experts suspect that the tiger strayed here from nearest forests in either Pilibhit or Uttarakhand, probably following a riverlet.

The Synthetic and Chemical Limited Company, commonly known as rubber factory here, spanning nearly 1,200 acres, was closed in 1999. Over the years, it has turned into a mini-forest providing a perfect habitat for big cats due to easy availability of prey, plenty of water in big tanks, dense tree cover, soft grass and suitable places to hide.

Asked why big cats preferring to live in the factory premises, divisional forest officer (DFO) Bharat Lal told TOI, “A wild animal likes to live in an environment with minimum disturbance. Besides, the campus also has abundant prey with a good population of nilgai and blackbuck besides old tanks filled with water to suit the tiger.”

For two years now, big cats have taken refuge in the factory but none has ever injured any human.

The presence of the latest resident was noticed by Ravindra Singh, one of the security guards at the factory. He said, “We recently found fresh set of pugmarks on campus and alerted forest department. After examining them, the forest officials installed five camera traps here on Saturday.”

The DFO said, “We have informed higher authorities in Lucknow about a tiger taking shelter in the rubber factory. RK Singh, a veterinarian from Kanpur zoo, will visit Bareilly soon to assess the situation and decide the next course of action.”

Experts said rescuing a tiger from the factory could be a challenge as the campus has several old tunnels, trenches and tanks. When a sub-adult tiger strayed here in 2018, it took two months to tranquilize it. Finally, it was hit by a tranquilizer dart when it hid in a dark trench.

At the same time, experts fear that if the tiger moves out of the factory, it can pose a threat to the nearby village settlement or be run over like the leopard as the national highway 24 and a railway track are situated in close proximity.

A red corner notice issued by Interpol is pending against her, as she has been classified as a fugitive who is wanted for prosecution in the country, according to top police and NIA sources. Other than Sections 13, 38 and 39 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act ( UAPA ), she has also been charged under Sections 120-B and 125 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 57 of the Kerala Police Act.

As per the sections of the UAPA, any person associating himself or herself with a terrorist or banned organisation to support the organisation or with an intention to further its activities, will invite an imprisonment of 10 years. Nimisha has also been charged with criminal conspiracy, waging war against an Asiatic power in alliance with the Government of India, under which a maximum of life imprisonment can be awarded.

Based on the request of the country, the Interpol had published Red Corner Notice against Nimisha on February 23, 2017, which is issued to seek the location and arrest of wanted persons with a view to extradite or similar lawful action. As per the notice, she is likely to have visited Afghanistan (Nangarhar, Tora Bora, Kabul), Iraq and Syria.

As per the summary facts of the case, which is called the ISIS Palakkad module case, Fathima and four others hatched a conspiracy from 2015 onwards in Palakkad and other places within the country and abroad with the intention of strengthening the activities of proscribed terrorist organization ISIS.

According to top police sources, the Centre can drop the charges if it wishes to, but it is unlikely to happen. “Every country has their own foreign terrorist fighter returnees’ policy and they go according to that. The very notice issued by the Interpol itself says that the country at the behest of which the notice has been issued has given assurances that extradition will be sought up on the arrest of the person, in conformity with its national laws and applicable bilateral and multi-lateral treaties,” sources said.

Responding to Nimisha’s request, her mother Bindu Sampath said that she would keep trying to get her back to India. “I had started losing hope. The video has established that they are alive and safe,” she told TOI.

BHUBANESWAR: The overall sales figure has dipped by 35% to 40% across Odisha with people shunning public places, closure of schools, colleges and hostels and clampdown on social functions.

“On an average, the market is sustaining a loss of around Rs 700 to Rs 800 crore per day. We apprehend if this situation continues, then worse is in store for us,” said Sudhakar Panda , secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Sangha.

The sale of essential commodities has gone down by 20% while the service sector is affected. “Essential commodities are not only bought by households but also by hotels, restaurants, hostels as well as for marriage functions. With educational institutions and eateries shut and clamp on functions, our business is affected,” said Panda.

Business in Malgodown, the largest wholesale market in the state, has also been affected. Sales have dropped by more than 40%. “We hope that this situation does not last long but its impact will be there for a long time,” said Debendra Sahu , secretary of Malgodown Traders Association .

However, the supply of essential commodities from other states have not been affected so far. “Our only option is to wait and watch. But we request the government to save us from this financial collapse,” said Sahu.

Similarly, Panda requested the government to maintain cleanliness in and around the major markets like Unit-I in the city. “More people depend on daily markets than shopping malls. The government need not shut the markets but can increase cleanliness and sanitation facilities,” Panda said.

The coronavirus pandemic might impact manufacturing, petrochemicals and marine industries sectors, sources said.

Chief medical officer, Dr Seema Agarwal, and nodal officer for contagious diseases, Dr Ashwani Gupta, said mobile medical units have been set up in the border villages of Ramnagra and Dhuria Palia. These are manned by a doctor, a pharmacist, a staff nurse and one lab technician for taking samples of suspected patients for tests and monitoring their condition in isolation wards.

The CMO said the medical team on Monday sent back one Nepalese child as he was suffering from high fever.

Dr Gupta said the department had made two quarantine centres -- at the CMO office and the government polytechnic -- while a 10-bed isolation ward had been set up at the district government hospital.

The CMO said, “As we don’t have any facility of a chest ventilator, we have arranged a five-bed isolation ward at SS Hospital, a private medial institution, which is equipped with the facility of a ventilator.”

There are not being provided with hand sanitisers or face masks by the varsity. AU’s apathy is in stark comparison to the vigilant attitude of other educational institutions in the state like Banaras Hindu University and Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur.On a visit to the various facilities like the central library and the computer room, TOI found the students sitting without wearing wearing masks and ignoring other preventive measures. In the computer room, mouse and keyboards being used by multiple users are not being sanitised by the authorities.At the baggage counter (Pigeon cell), located at the entrance of the library, the lone attendant was spotted sitting surrounded by bags of students who had entered the library. Neither the attendant nor the visitors were seen wearing masks or using sanitisers.“On one hand, authorities have suspended classes and postponed the EC meeting due to the coronavirus threat and on the other hand there is no one to stop these students from coming to the library,” said former head of the AU’s department of medieval and modern history Yogeshwar Tiwari.AU public relations officer (PRO) Shailendra Mishra said, “Indeed, students gathering in huge numbers at the reading hall and computer room is not advisable considering the present scenario.

118,['17/03/2020'],City scales up quarantine facilities to brace for spurt in corona cases,"Visakhapatnam: Health authorities are setting up quarantine facilities and isolation wards in hospitals in order to be prepared for a spurt in coronavirus cases.

As per doctors, Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) has a 75-bed-strong quarantine facility has been set up. The Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD) has 25 beds in its isolation ward, which can be extended to 50 now. The Area Hospital at Anakapalle has six beds. Apart from these, major private hospitals have also been asked to keep some beds ready away from the crowd in a separate wing for isolation.

Speaking about the importance of quarantine and isolation wards, Dr L Kalyanprasad, retired epidemiologist and former district nodal officer for swine flu, said, “Quarantining of suspected patients either at home or hospitals is needed to prevent him or her from infecting others because the person can be a carrier of the infection. Ideally, isolation or quarantine should be done in a separate room or cabin for each suspected case but in India, such complete isolation is not possible in most hospitals and therefore a few suspected cases or those with travel history share a room or ward.”

Dr P V Sudhakar, principal of Andhra Medical College (AMC) said, “In VIMS, there is provision of 20 bed wards for people with travel history but no symptoms. However, persons with conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and heart problems are kept in individual rooms for extra care even during quarantine. If anybody shows symptoms of Covid 19, they will be immediately transported to GHCCD by ambulances. In GHCCD, isolation rooms with glass partition are provided for suspected cases. If a patient is fine after spending two weeks in quarantine, the patient is sent back home. A standard operating procedure has been developed from quarantine to transport of suspected cases.” Speaking about the treatment modality, Dr Sudhakar said, “Suspected patients are treated not just with paracetamols for Covid 19 but simultaneously treated for Swine Flu as well. They are also administered Cetrizine and antibiotics to prevent additional infections.”

119,['17/03/2020'],Footfall of devotees dips at Jagannath Temple,"Representative image

BHUBANESWAR: The footfall of devotees at the Jagannath Temple in Puri nosedived drastically on Monday with the state government sensitising people to avoid public gatherings and implementing social distancing to tackle Covid-19. While daily rituals of the deities were solemnized like normal days, sale of Mahaprasad dropped substantially.

“We witnessed drastic fall in the arrival of devotees at the Jagannath Temple. It is good to find that the devotees are following the advise to avoid crowded places like the temple for the time being,” said district collector (Puri) Balwant Singh .

At least 30,000 devotees visit the 12th century shrine on any given day. However, only around 10,000 pilgrims offered prayers at the temple on Monday, a day after Odisha’s first novel coronavirus case was detected in Bhubaneswar on Sunday.

The low arrival of devotees on Monday reflected on the donations. “We received Rs 98,872 donation from the ‘temple hundi’ (donation box) on Monday. The hundi collection was Rs 3,36,317 on Sunday, Rs 3,33,751 on Saturday and Rs 2.49 lakh on Friday,” said temple’s spokesperson Laxmidhar Pujapanda .

Servitors said sale of Mahaprasad has been affected due to low footfall. “We have been forced to cut down on the quantity of Mahaprasad cooked. However, preparation of ‘bhog’ for the deities has not been curtailed,” said Shayama Mahapatra , a servitor. While Mahaprasad for nearly 30,000 pilgrims is cooked on a normal day, it was prepared for only around 5,000 devotees on Monday.

On Sunday, the Jagannath temple administration said devotees would be asked to furnish their health details by filling up a self-declaration form. “We could not start it on Monday as we have given orders to print the self-declaration forms. The practice is likely to be adopted on Tuesday or Wednesday,” the district collector said.

The administration also decided to streamline the darshan system to ensure that there is a gap of at least two metres between devotees as they queue up for a glimpse of Lord Jagannath , Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra.

MADURAI: Though the state government has shut down all schools and colleges due to COVID-19 scare, the department of school education is yet to take any precautionary measures to safeguard the students of Class X to XII writing public board exams.

Measures like temperature screening and use of hand sanitizers at the exam halls are not in place at the board exam centres in the district where the students of class XI and XII are writing their exams. “We have so far not received any instruction regarding such preventive measures. We also didn’t have any case of a sick student writing the exams. But, if instructed by state authorities, we will readily implement measures like isolating students who show symptoms of fever and cough,” said Madurai district Chief Educational Officer R Swaminathan. As per usual regulations, candidates with infectious illnesses like chicken pox are isolated in a separate room and scribes are assigned to help them give the exam. Students and parents said that they would feel safer if strict and better monitoring is done.

“Even if the exams are conducted for a matter of few hours, it is enough for the infection to spread. The students should at least be directed to use hand sanitisers when entering and exiting the hall,” said Nivethitha R, parent of a Class XII public exam candidate. Teachers further added that invigilators too need to be protected and requested the government to implement the preventive measures at least for Class X exams, which are set to begin on March 27.A total of 1,13,321 students from Classes X, XI and XII are writing their board exams this year.

PUNE: Self-reporting to health officials or doctors at civic body-run Naidu Hospital has now been made mandatory for people with Covid-19 symptoms, in addition to history of international travel.

With the enforcement of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and invocation of the Epidemic Diseases Act, hiding information and not ensuring self-reporting amount to violation of both the laws and may attract punishment.

“People who have travelled abroad in the last 28 days or a month and have flu-like symptoms should report to Naidu Hospital. No one should hide information, if he or she has history of international travel. If they do not have any symptom,s then they should inform us and home quarantine themselves. If an international traveller has symptoms, then she or he must report to Naidu Hospital,” said public health expert Kalpana Baliwant, head of the Information, Education and Communication (IEC) at the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).

Coronavirus outbreak live updates

“It has been observed that citizens who have travelled abroad and landed in Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad or any other airports in the country come back to the city (Pune) either in private cabs, bus or train. Such people should self-report themselves and remain home quarantined for 14 days even if they do not have symptoms. If they have symptoms, then they must immediately report to Naidu Hospital and take necessary precautions, such as wearing masks and socially distancing themselves. The aim should be to not infect others,” Baliwant said.

Divisional commissioner Divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar on Monday appealed to people work from home, but said industrial units have been told that they should not face any loss in production. He said the industrial units should tell people who are not involved in the actual manufacturing process to work from home.

Mhaisekar said IT companies have been requested to now send their employees for now for meetings or conferences and to carry out such processes through video calls.

122,['17/03/2020'],"BJP moves apex court, says horse-trading ‘at its peak’","Bhopal: The BJP on Monday moved Supreme Court, seeking an order to the Speaker to hold a floor test “within 12 hours”, as per the directions issued by Governor Lalji Tandon. The apex court is likely to hear the matter on Tuesday.

The petition, filed by former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and nine others, argues that the Madhya Pradesh government has been reduced to minority after the resignation of 22 Congress MLAs. The government “intentionally and wilfully defied” the Governor’s direction for a floor test, it says.

“The Congress government has lost majority in the house, so we have urged the court to immediately issue directives for floor test,” Chouhan told TOI.

“Any deferment of the floor test will further encourage horse-trading and will be in utter violation of the directions issued by the Governor, the law laid down by this court and the spirit and basic structure of the Constitution of India,” the petition says, adding that the Kamal Nath government has “no moral, legal, democratic or constitutional right to remain in power even for a single day”.

“All possible attempts are being made by the hon'ble CM to convert his minority government into majority by giving threats, allurements to the members of Vidhan Sabha. Horse-trading is at its peak,” said the petition, pleading that the floor test be conducted on March 16, as directed by the Governor. Speaker N P Prajapati and CM Kamal Nath have been made respondents in the petition.

The BJP national leadership also held meetings in New Delhi to discuss the next step and legal options before the party.

In a show of strength, BJP paraded 106 of its MLAs before the Governor soon after Prajapati adjourned the House. Only Maihar MLA Narayan Tripathi did not join BJP MLAs at the Raj Bhawan line-up.

Responding to BJP’s request, Governor Tandon said, “I had issued some instructions, which should have been followed. Appropriate action will be taken. Be assured that no one will violate your rights.”

“The chief minister is running away from trust vote as he is aware that his government lacks majority. BJP has majority and we have appealed to the Governor to issue orders for conducting the floor test at the earliest. He (Governor) has assured to protect our constitutional rights,” said Chouhan after meeting the Governor.

On adjournment of the House, he said, “Congress has 92 MLAs while BJP’s 106 MLAs are physically present, which shows that we have clear majority in the House. The Kamal Nath-led state government has lost majority and, thus, cannot rule the state. The government is unstable and cannot even be saved on the pretext of Coronavirus.”

BJP state in-charge Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, state president V D Sharma, LOP Gopal Bhargava and chief whip Narottam Mishra were in the BJP delegation. “The Governor’s orders were not followed. The government has run away from the battlefield,” Chouhan said.

Bhargava said, “We have majority in the House but the CM is not ready for a trust vote. We will fight for it.” Mishra also hit out at the government, saying: “If the government doesn’t follow Governor’s instructions, then we have legal options. It won’t take much time.” He denied that BJP has moved a no-confidence motion.

The board has invited applications from the interested contractors who would be responsible to set up solar power plants for a period of 25 years as part of the board’s plans to improve the solar energy generation capacity of the state by setting up plans worth 150MW in domestic sector.

Interested contractors are advised to submit tender before April 17. The board proposes to set up roof mounted solar PVs with 50MW capacity for the 2020-21 period, along with other plans for solar power generation. Registration of consumers interested in setting up solar units is already on. First 75,000 consumers registering with the board would be eligible for the scheme, for which they would get government subsidy.

As per the guidelines published by ministry of new and renewable energy, 40% subsidy would be available for plans up to 3KW capacity. For every additional unit, up to 10KW, subsidy would be 20% of the total cost. As per the ministry guidelines, the cost per 1KW plant, including operation and maintenance charges, is Rs 54, 000. The Kerala model scheme offers more flexibility to those interested in setting up solar units on their roof tops. As per this scheme, consumers can join the drive by spending only 12 to 25 % of the project cost. KSEB would be in charge of the maintenance of such plants for a period of 25 years. The board has devised various business models for this scheme.

On an average, nearly 100 odd buses ply from Visakhapatnam to cities including Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai and Vijayawada. The average occupancy ratio of buses is around 60-70 per cent on a daily basis and 100 per cent during peak seasons such as festivals, summer vacations etc.

But after the outbreak of coronavirus, the number of travellers have reduced to around 50 per cent, said a senior APPT officer at Dwaraka Bus Station in the city. The APPT officer said that they operate nearly 70 to 80 buses to long routes from the city bus station to Vijayawada, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore.

“Generally, those who miss trains or decide to travel after failing to get confirmed tickets in trains opt for buses. There is no rush of passengers due to Covid-19,” he said. A private travellers agent at Ram Nagar said they stopped services of a bus to each long-route city in the past three days due to falling demand.

BERHAMPUR: The district administration has roped in women self help groups (SHGs) to make masks to tide over the shortage due to increase in demand after the Covid-19 pandemic.

Around 100 SHG members in Aska, Berhampur , Hinjili and Ganjam have started making masks. The supply is expected to start from Tuesday after verification of samples.

In the first phase, the masks will be supplied to all hospitals after getting formal order from the chief district medical officer (CDMO), said district social welfare officer (DSWO) Manorama Reddy . Though the price of each mask is yet to be fixed, it might be around Rs 25, she said.

“The SHG members are working overtime to supply adequate number of masks,” said Minati Panda, a supervisor of SHGs in Berhampur. She said 40 women members of two SHGs divided into two groups are making the masks. “Our members are familiar with tailoring having stitched school uniforms for children.

MADURAI: Residents of housing apartments built by Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board at Rajakoor in Madurai district held a road roko protest on Monday opposing the quarantine facility for normal passengers from Covid-19-affected countries that is to be set up there. Police and health officials held talks and have temporarily suspended work for the facility.

With Covid-19 quarantine facilities actively being set up across the state to isolate and monitor passengers from the seven Covid-19-affected countries specified by the government, one such centre was to be housed in some of the vacant cabins at the housing apartments in Rajakoor built by the TN Slum Clearance Board. However, as news of health officials inspecting the area for setting up of the facility spread, panicked locals opposed the plan and even submitted a petition to the collector. Though the work for the facility was assured to be suspended, health officials still visited the site on Monday prompting locals to protest.

At least a group of around 50 residents staged a protest disrupting traffic for some time. “We strongly oppose setting up this facility. It is a matter of life and death. What if we get infected by chance? That fear is always there. If it is so safe, then why can’t it be shifted anywhere else, even centre of the city,” said one of the protesters. The protesters also added that if the facility is set up for functioning, they would be forced to leave the area. Police and health officials later held talks assuring that they are suspending the work after which the crowd dispersed.

Meanwhile, health officials defended that all safety measures were to be put in place and that the people to be quarantined would not even have symptoms of Covid-19. They added that it is one among many spots in the district identified for a quarantine facility. “There is nothing to fear about quarantining. We tried our best to assure the locals of their safety but so far it was of no avail. The district collector will take the final decision,” said a health official.

“The customers are aware that they can contract the virus in a crowded place and do not want to visit markets. The footfall in the Market Yard has also declined. Many retailers are stocking up on vegetables that have a longer shelf-life, so they do not have to visit the wholesale market daily,” a vegetable retailer on NIBM Road, Vitthal Hanamgar, said.

“Business dropped by 60-70% over the last week. The orders from restaurants and canteens have also dropped. Recently, an order for delivering vegetables to a wedding function was cancelled as the event was postponed,” a retailer in Shivaji Market, Shankar Surve, said

An official from Agriculture Produce Market Committee, Pune, told TOI that the sales of vegetables in the wholesale market place in Market Yard have dipped by nearly 5%. “We have noticed that the footfall of small-time retailers has declined. Large-scale retailers continue to buy stock,” the official said.

Vilas Bhujbal, president, Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Traders’ and Agents’ Association, said the impact of the coronavirus scare in the city would be visible in the next few days. “Footfalls in restaurants have reduced and schools and colleges have been ordered to shut down. This is likely to reduce vegetable demand from canteens and restaurants,” he said.

Nagpur: Farmers and tribals related to Maharashtra Rajya Kisan Sabha (MRKS) staged a non-violent protest for their various demands, including the promised piece of land by the central government, at Sanvidhan Chowk on Monday. More than 100 activists were present.

The protest was headed by Arun Wanker. Later, the protesters went to submit a memorandum of their demands to the district collector. As he was busy in a meeting related to coronavirus, the memorandum was handed over to additional collector Shrikant Phadke, who will pass on the application to the district collector.

The protesters were informed that they will be called again once the district collector goes through their demands.

Their main demand was regarding the promised 5 acre land near the forest area where they have been cultivating crops for many years and also performing other livelihood-related activities like poultry, silkworm rearing, fishing, dairy and producing honey. The announcement was made by the central government in 2006-07, but wasn’t implemented.

The protesters are also opposing CAA and NRC and demanding loan waivers. The government announced loan waivers but the implementation has not been done entirely.

The other demands included 12-feet high fencing for villages and farms inside the forest area, irrigation facilities for farmers, loan waiver and jobs for families of farmers who committed suicide, compensation for farmers whose crops were destroyed in October 2019, pension for farmers above 60 years of age and aid to those who suffered attacks by wild animals.

People in general have been requested to inform authorities through Twitter, Facebook or Whatsapp if they come across anyone with a recent travel history to foreign countries.

According to sources from Public Health Department of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), 112 people were added to the list of people under scrutiny on Monday alone. Based on the data shared by the union ministry of health through the aviation ministry, GVMC authorities were able to acquire data of the number of people coming back to the city after touring various countries.

“We used to collect data of citizens who toured China, but now we are considering all countries. We have set up a separate team to go to their homes to monitor their health conditions,” a senior GVMC officer told TOI.

The officer further said that they in fact planned to cover all four lakh households in the city. So far, nearly 80 per cent of the total households have been covered in collecting data on the health condition of the inmates of houses. However, the survey of households of people who have travelled abroad in the recent past is being given special attention, the officer said. “We are yet to evaluate the data we gathered through the door-to-door survey. We will be able to announce the findings of the survey through a proper channel,” the officer said.

132,['17/03/2020'],State government orders first ever interim survey for procurement of additional sugarcane crop,"Pilibhit: State cane commissioner Sanjay R Bhoosreddy has issued orders to all district cane officers and sugar mills to carry out an interim survey of standing sugarcane crop that is in excess over the quantity that is bonded, following orders of the UP cane development minister Suresh Rana.

The decision was taken by the state government on the basis of feedback from sugarcane growers on the government’s toll free helpline number. As per orders issued at Lucknow on March 14, the interim survey is to be concluded latest by March 31. The Pilibhit cane department reported that it has already initiated the interim survey on Monday.

Bhoosreddy said the state had decided to issue interim bonds for the first time ever to facilitate farmers, whereby sugar mills would procure their surplus crop.

The interim survey will begin immediately to cover areas under those sugar mills where 10 of the total 12 fortnights of the supply calendar has been exhausted, or in case the farmers had already been issued supply tickets for the quantity of their cane that was bonded, Bhoosreddy said.

He added the interim survey would be conducted jointly by supervisors of the district cane department and mill staff. The final figures of additional bonds to supply surplus sugarcane to mills would be fed, along with estimated numbers of extra supply tickets, into the sugarcane administration’s online system.

Regarding the surplus standing crop in Pilibhit, district cane officer Jitendra Kumar Mishra said all 2.42 lakh sugarcane growers in the district had in total executed supply bonds for 4.23 crore quintals of cane during the current crushing season.

The crop had been sown on 95,000 hectare area and the total produce was assessed at 7.34 crore quintals. “Although the figures show 3 crore quintals of surplus over the bonded quantity, farmers normally utilise about 15% of the total produce to produce jaggery, while another 15% is saved as seed for the next crop”.

However, in compliance with the state’s orders, the department initiated the interim survey from Monday, as out of the 179 cane supply centers in the district, farmers had already supplied 30 centers with the bonded amount, while in another 73 centres, supply tickets for the 10th fortnight had already been issued to farmers, Mishra said.

133,['17/03/2020'],Corona-effect: Traders rue losses as shoppers stay away from mkts,"Prayagraj: Traders are ruing losses as many Prayagraj residents are choosing to give shopping in markets a miss and stay indoors due to their concern over rising number of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) cases reported across the country.

Be it upscale markets like Civil Lines or wholesale ones in Chowk and Katra, shopkeepers across the city claim that their businesses have taken a hit as more and more people start practising ‘social distancing’.

Traders dealing in garments and leather products appear to be worst hit as their sales go down by 20-30% in the past three days.

Eateries and restaurants too are bearing the brunt as their footfall has decreased substantially over the past four days.

President of Civil Lines Vyapaar Mandal Sushil Kharbanda said, “None of us were prepared for this loss. While authorities should ensure that people are taking all possible precautions, but they should also see to its that there is no unnecessary panic.”

He said some business owners are afraid that they won’t be able to sell enough items even to cover daily operational costs and pay employees their monthly salaries.

The situation isn’t any different in other markets like Muthhiganj and Kydganj.

The saving grace to the market gloom are the long queues outside chemists and pharmacies. Druggists are flooded by with requests for hand sanitisers and N95 masks triggered by panic buying.

According to Kharbanda, chemists and druggists in the city recorded about 20% increase in sale compared to regular days.

Apart from hotels and restaurants, caterers have also been struggling with financial strain as many of their clients ended up cancelling events and parties due to the Covid-19 outbreak in the past one week.

Raju Pathak, a city-based caterer, said, “We had received orders for private events and most of them have now been cancelled now due to the novel coronavirus threat.”

Retail shopkeepers said that they are waiting for the situation to improve”. A trader, Ravi Kumar, said, “We are ensuring that our surroundings are clean and shopkeepers and our staff wear masks at all times to check the spread of coronavirus.”

According to data released by the health department on Monday, 146 passengers returned to Prayagraj after completing foreign visits, including to countries affected by novel coronavirus, since December 29. “While 47 were released after being put under observation for 28 days, 99 have been quarantined at home,” the report said. The passengers included flyers to like countries like China, Hong Kong and Thailand.

District epidemiologist Dr Anshu Vaishya said no novel coronavirus cases have been reported in Prayagraj yet. However, a series of awareness and educational camps are being organised to spread awareness among masses.

School authorities in the port city are reluctant to send students on vacation, but instead are trying to find ways to ensure that students are up to date as far as their curricula are concerned and also safe from coronavirus.

“We have introduced an online programme whereby students can opt to study from home and attend classes online. We will introduce the programme within a couple of days. We are actually planning to implement the programme round the year in the future,” said Biju Baby the principal of Oakridge International School.

Schools in the city have adopted a host of measures to ensure that the students, guardians and teaching and non-teaching staff don’t contact COVID 19.

Institutions are encouraging students to wear masks and giving breaks at regular intervals so that students and staff can clean their hands using sanitizers.

As this disease mostly transmitted through surfaces, school authorities are seeing to it the school is continually cleaned with disinfectants approved by World Health Organization.

“The idea is pretty simple. We don’t want a complete shut down. Rather, we have introduced preventive measures in every possible way so that students don’t get infected,” said N Sita Lakshmi, principal of Sanskruthi Global School. Not only private schools, government and municipality schools in the city too have drawn up an elaborate blueprint to ensure that the students and staff don’t come in contact with the virus.

“We have introduced an elaborate preventive measure in our school. During assembly, we remind students about ‘dos’ and ‘don’ts’ to follow outside school. Attending social gathering and having cold food like ice cream is a strict ‘no’ for them,” said D Apala Naidu, the headmaster of KDPM High School.

Hyderabad: About 100 saplings have been uprooted on the stretch running from Inorbit mall to IKEA. Said to be for road widening, officials could not confirm if permission was taken before the move.

The saplings near the Salarpuria Sattva complex were bulldozed in the last 48 hours. “I pass by the area every day and saw the saplings there two days ago,” says Harish Daga, a city-based activist.

He said the saplings had been planted under the state’s Haritha Haram programme. “Their removal needs to be investigated,” he said.

Following a tweet by Daga, two batches of officials arrived at the scene to investigate the matter. V Pradeep, technical assistant, GHMC biodiversity wing, initially inspected the area. He however said the area fell under the jurisdiction of TSIIC (Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation). “We have forwarded the details to the forest department who will take over the inquiry. About a 100 saplings may have been affected.”

TSIIC zonal manager, Cyberabad zone, confirmed that the saplings had been removed. He, however, said that a private party had removed them for road widening work ahead of the flyover in the area. “We have to confirm if permission was taken,” he said. When contacted, Srikanth, forest section officer, who was also at the scene, said, “We have tried contacting TSIIC officials and will decide on the future course of action after speaking with them.”

Putting the number of saplings removed at a more conservative 60, the forest department official said, “they belonged to three different species -- kanuga, gulmohar and some bougainvillea. While witnesses have said these were only saplings, if the plants nearby are to be considered, they could be as much as 6-10 years old.”

141,['17/03/2020'],Wildlife frescos to cover walls of 4 NE railways stations,"Pilibhit: Four railway stations of North Eastern (NE) Railways — Pilibhit, Puranpur, Mailani and Lakhimpur — will soon have frescos and paintings of wildlife adorning their walls, on the pattern of Sawai Madhopur railway station, which depicts the wildlife diversity of Ranthambhor national park in Rajasthan. A comprehensive plan is being prepared by forest officials that will encompass natural heritage and cultural values as social fabric of wildlife conservation.

Pilibhit tiger reserve (PTR) field director H. Rajamohan, along with his counterpart in Dudhwa tiger reserve (DTR) Sanjay Kumar, and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), has written a letter to the GM of NE Railways in Gorakhpur, seeking his consent to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the conversion of the four stations into creative destinations, after receiving in-principle approval from the principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) (PCCF) of UP, Sunil Pandey.

District magistrate Vaibhav Shrivastav has given consent to refer the matter to the state government for necessary financial assistance, and to be an integral part of this project. “The plan is unique, and we will extend all our cooperation to make it a success,” he said.

Notably, both Lakhimpur-Kheri and Pilibhit districts are saturated with forests, tht host diverse wildlife. DTR in Kheri, along with its three constituents – Dudhwa national park, Kishanpur wildlife sanctuary and Katarniaghat wildlife sanctuary —stretches over 2,200 sq km, while PTR in Pilibhit is spread across 730 sq km.

Both tiger reserves have several species of wild carnivores, herbivores, aquatic life, rodents, reptiles, lizards, birds and insects. Tigers, leopards, sloth bears in PTR, and rhinos and elephants in addition to big cats in DTR, are some of the most distinctive species that require special conservation plans due to many factors, including rise in man-animal conflict.

“The plan to cover Pilibhit and Puranpur railway stations in Pilibhit district and Mailani and Lakhimpur stations in Kheri district with pictures of wildlife will strengthen efforts to conserve important wildlife species. We will soon send a delegation of senior forest officials to meet railway authorities, including the GM of NE Railways, to finalise the plans,” said Sunil Pandey, the PCCF of UP.

Rajamohan said a key role in execution of the plan would be played by WWF, as the Sawai Madhopur project had been sponsored by them as well. “I have spoken to the WWF regional coordinator Mudit Gupta, who has consented to extend fullest cooperation,” he said.

“WWF had arranged the paint and theme for frescos at Sawai Madhopur, while the paintings were executed by local artists. For these four railway stations, we are planning to coordinate with either Delhi-based National Institute of Fine Arts (NIFA) or Ahmadabad-based National Institute of Design (NID) for the blueprint and designs,” said WWF regional coordinator Gupta. He said he will refer the matter to his seniors in New Delhi for their consent.

PTR deputy director Naveen Khandelwal told TOI he had comprehensive discussion with senior divisional manager (commercial) of NE Railways’ Izzatnagar division, Narendra Joshi, regarding his department’s permission to use the stations for the project. “Following our talks, Joshi asked for a copy of the plan to take it ahead,” Khandelwal said. This was confirmed by Joshi to TOI.

Around 25 students and nature lovers participated in the event organised by Eastern Ghats Wildlife Society (EGWS) to get a glimpse of interesting creatures including sea anemones, sea urchins, starfish and algae that live on the interface between land and sea.

Conservation biologist and founder president of EGWS Murthy Kantimahanti, said, “We choose easily accessible Rushikonda Beach for tide pooling activity because its rocky shoreline is ideal for spotting inter-tidal flora and fauna specially during low tides. In a fun and educative way, our volunteers told participants about habitat, survival and basic facts about inter-tidal fauna such as sea anemones, sea urchins, starfish, barnacles, zoanthids, sea lettuce, feather stars and various species of fish. Most of these species can be found attached to the rocky outcrops along beaches.”

One of the participants, P Ratna Latha, said, “It was a nice introduction to unique marine life through tide pooling.”

“Tide-pooling has made us more aware of the life between land and sea. We are looking forward to more such activity,” said, W Manoj, another participant.

145,['17/03/2020'],HC orders arrest of four accused,"Kochi: The high court on Monday directed for arresting the four persons who were acquitted by the Pocso special court in Walayar case.

A division bench of Justice A Hariprasad and Justice M R Anitha issued the directive while considering appeals filed by the mother of the two minor girls who were raped and were later found dead. Appeals filed by the state government challenging the verdicts by the special court were also heard by the court. The mother and the government had filed six appeals each. The high court has now directed for producing the arrested accused before the trial court and then let them off on conditional bails.

The court’s directive came after state government inform-ed the court that it would be difficult to apprehend the accused if the high court quashes the special court’s verdicts. It is suspected that one of the accused is already in hiding, government told the court while seeking permission for the arrests.

In the appeals filed through advocates C P Udayabhanu and C J Varghese Vinu, the mother has sought to reverse the special court’s verdict acquitting the accused or to conduct a fresh trial. The accused against who appeals have been filed by the government are Madhu alias Kutti Madhu, Pradeep Kumar, Madhu alias Valiya Madhu, and Shibu.

The mother had alleged before the high court that the Pocso court’s acquittal of the accused is nothing but a mockery of justice and will amount to perpetration of gross and irreparable injustice. The judgments of acquittals suffer from illegality, manifest errors, and perversity, warranting interference by the high court in the interest of justice, the mother had contended.

She had also pointed out that though these were real cases of murders, the investigating agency succumbed to political pressure and obeyed its political masters to pave the escape route for their members.

The errors, omissions, and irregularities have resulted in failure of justice, which demands a direction for conducting a fresh trial, the mother’s plea had stated.

Government had said in the appeals that the investigation conducted in the cases were faulty and that the angle of murder was not probed.

The plan to fly the MLAs away from the city was aborted after fresh instructions by Governor Lalji Tandon to chief minister Kamal Nath, to conduct the floor test on March 17.

The BJP MLAs who returned to the state capital early Monday morning were lodged at a hotel on Hoshabgabad road from where they reached the assembly in the morning to attend the first day of budget session. However, the House was adjourned by Speaker NP Prajapati after Governor's address following which floor test in the House could not be conducted.

It was decided that all the 106 legislators will be flown back to Delhi by a chartered plane from Bhopal in the evening.

“On Monday, former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, LoP Gopal Bhargava and Narottam Mishra reached the hotel at 8.30 am and met the MLAs and sought their signature and address details on a paper. At 10 am, they left for the assembly in two buses.""

Sources further disclosed that the saffron leadership has made it clear that not a single MLAs gets lured by the Congress leaders during their stay in the state capital.

The infected individual fled the facility around 11pm and went to his home before visiting a friend’s house in the neighbourhood, police said.

It took the police as well as the health authorities about two hours to track and bring him back to the quarantine facility in Bhosari. He has now been put in the isolation ward.

Additional commissioner Ramnath Pokale of the Pimpri Chinchwad police said, “During the two-odd hours when he was out of the hospital, the man came in contact with four persons, including three of his relatives. All the four persons are being monitored by the health officials.”

Pokale said the man had returned from a foreign country recently. “He was admitted to the Bhosari hospital two days ago after developing Covid-19 symptoms. His throat swab sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) has tested positive for the contagion on Saturday night,” he said.

A police team comprising assistant commissioner Ram Jadhav, senior inspector of the Bhosari police Shankar Autade swung into action soon after receiving an alert about the incident. “The hospital authorities had the details and contact numbers of his relatives. While a police team rushed to his house, another got information that the man had visited his friend’s house in Bhosari,” the officer said.

When the patient was returning to his home, the police team surrounded him. “But, we did not touch him,” Pokale said, adding that he was taken to the facility in an ambulance by the health officials soon after.

The Pimpri Chinchwad police have deployed bandobast outside the hospital to avoid such incidents, he said.

Public health expert Pawan Salve, chief of the health department at Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation said, “The person is a confirmed case of Covid-19. He left our hospital in Bhosari (where he was quarantined) without informing us. We found him near his home and brought him back. We have traced those who might have come in his contact to rule out the contagion spread.”

He said, “People should not panic. Fear and anxiety about a disease often lead to social stigma. This is a stressful time and all should cooperate.”

Police said that 26-year-old Asif Shaikh, a trucker, wanted to distance himself from his girlfriend Husna Jabeen Kismat — who was allegedly demanding to marry her immediately — as his family was against the match. He also assumed that Husna, who worked at a mobile phone shop, was in relationships with other men. This had soured the matter between them.

Sources stated that Husna had told her brother that if she did not return, then it would be her body which would land at the doorstep. Her brother, upset to know that she was with Shaikh, had told her that she would not be accepted. The families already were at loggerheads, as Shaikh’s mother and elder brother did not like Husna.

The matter was referred to Pachpaoli police station . The cops’ decision to refrain from taking legal action had only aggravated the situation, leading to the murder.

It’s learnt Husna and Shaikh had befriended each other at Gaddigodam. Shaikh earlier worked at a shop at Gaddigodam, and Husna used to pass through this locality after attending her college. Husna and Shaikh had eloped in the past too, but had returned after a day.

On Monday, Husna’s body was spotted in the early morning after which Sadar police staffers were alerted. Husna was identified with the help of her Aadhar card in her purse, following which her family residing at Mahendra Nagar was alerted.

After collecting the details, Sadar police had rounded up Asif from a spot at Seminary Hills, where he was hiding.

Police said Husna and Shaikh had met at Mangalwari bazaar on Sunday, following which they had a heated altercation. The couple had then headed to Sharda Square in Pachpaoli. They had later returned to Mangalwari and headed to the basement of the shopping complex, where Husna’s body was found.

Bhopal: Even as the political developments heat up Madhya Pradesh, weather seems to be going in the other direction. Mornings and nights continue to be colder even though half of the month of March is already over. On Monday, the day and night temperatures were more than five degrees below normal in Bhopal.

Besides, the weather office forecast another round of “light rain” in the next 48 hours in Bhopal.

On Monday, the minimum temperature in Bhopal was 12.9 degree Celsius, which was 5.2 degrees below normal, and the maximum temperature was 26.8 degree Celsius, 6.5 degrees below normal.

Across state, the minimum temperature was recorded in Raisen at 9 degree Celsius. Except in Narsinghpur, the minimum temperature across MP was recorded at 15 degrees Celsius or less. In the hill station of Pachmarhi, the minimum temperature was 8 degree Celsius.

The Indian meteorological department, Bhopal circle, attributed this to the northerly winds reaching Bhopal. The recent weather phenomenon of western disturbances had led to snowfall at several places in the northern parts of the country, resulting in northerly winds blowing south from there which have been creating colder conditions in Madhya Pradesh, a weather official said.

Weather office also said that another western disturbance is approaching and it may lead to rainfall in several parts of Madhya Pradesh including Bhopal, in the next 48 hours.

After load of tests increased multifold from March 10, this lab has started functioning in three shifts and working 24x7 from March 14. The present team is working under the leadership of dean Dr Ajay Keoliya and HoD of microbiology department Dr Sharmila Raut .

After four patients tested positive in Nagpur and three in Yavatmal, the number of first-line high risk contacts of these seven patients also increased. At the same time, the number of samples of suspects having travel history to high-risk nations also started increasing, especially after March 12. Due to limited human resources, the process of completing the tests became lengthy and results used to get delayed.

“As we wanted to deliver the results at the earliest, we demanded human resource from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Nagpur, and government medical colleges from Akola and Nagpur. We received prompt and positive response. Now, we have three more technicians. This has increased our speed and efficiency,” said Dr Raut.

The lab completed tests of more than 40 samples in a day on Sunday. More than 30 samples from across the region reached here on Monday and tests are under way.

The team has developed a standard operating procedure (SOP) to conduct these tests to ensure timely and accurate results. The team includes Dr Raut as principle investigator, Dr Ravindra Khadse, Dr Babita Fageria and Dr Puja Shrendre (senior residents), Asmita Babhulkar (VRDL scientist), and technicians Meenal bansod and Harish Nimbekar.

The load on this lab is all set to increase as the graph of positive patients is still moving upwards. Demand for more such laboratories is now being raised from the medical fraternity.

IGGMCH was declared nodal laboratory for virus testing on January 31

Installed all necessary infrastructure for tests of swab samples

Received the reverse agent chemical required for Covid-19 test on February 4

Started testing samples from February 5

First sample from Nagpur was tested here on March 5

Till date, 95 samples from Nagpur have been tested here, 4 of them positive

55 samples from other places of Vidarbha and neighbouring states have been tested, 3 of them positive

How Covid-19 samples are tested

Coronaviruses have genomes encoded by RNA

Therefore, a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cannot be used to detect it

This viral genome can be detected only with a small addition of a reverse transcriptase step (which converts RNA to DNA)

This technique is called RT-PCR and a reverse agent chemical is required for it

IGGMCH already had the PCR machine

Agent was received from National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune in February

PUNE: Health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday told TOI that “locally made kits” and machines will be used for testing if there is any delay in procuring them for testing persons showing symptoms of Covid-19 in the state.

The Centre has procured kits from China and Korea but the rising cases is a cause of concern. There is a heavy demand from the world over, and there may be some delay is getting them, the minister said.

According to ICMR, the country currently conducts up to 10,000 tests a day. The council’s laboratories have about 1,00,000 testing kits and an additional 2,00,000 have been ordered.

The locally made kits will be procured by the government. The state has registered the highest number of positive cases that has spiralled up to 39 on Monday and a large number of first contact persons of travellers are being traced and checked for symptoms. The state is ready with a “back-up plan” in case a situation arises, Tope said.

He added that as of now there was enough testing kits and machines in place in the state and there was no reason to worry.

He said all the kits are provided by the Centre through the National Institute of Virology (NIV) to the state as per requirement and checks are conducted for those with a travel history to high-risk countries. Anyone who has had contact with a lab positive person is either quarantined or home quarantined after which they would be laboratory tested, he added.

“If there is paucity of kits in the days to come we have already spoken to experts and we are ready with a locally made diagnostic kit which can be used,” he added.

All the district collectors have been told to ready ventilators and other equipment locally in case they fall short.

Five machines will be installed at KEM, Mumbai, Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai, Haffkine, JJ Hospital and the BJ Medical hospital in two to three days to ease the pressure. Additional testing centres may come up at hospitals in Sangli, Solapur, Dhule and Aurangabad which are run by medical colleges.

The government is bearing the expenses of the tests and Rs 45 crore has been sanctioned to the six divisions. Pune division has got Rs 15 crore, Konkan division has Rs 10 cr and Nagpur, Amravati, Aurangabad and Nashik divisions have been sanctioned Rs 4 crore each.

162,['17/03/2020'],"Flouting SCB rules, owner demolishes building","Secunderabad: A person was killed when the owner of a commercial building at Karkhana in the Cantonment area bulldozed the structure, flouting the Cantonment Act that requires one to take permission from the Secunderabad Cantonment Board before demolishing a property.

This was the first ever such incident since the inception of the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB).

According to records of SCB’s engineering wing, the property (G+3) belonged to Durga Prasad, a realtor. He had rented it to M/s Satyam Computer Services (firm of former CEO Byrraju Ramalinga Raju) five years ago, but the company vacated it later. It was then leased to a private bank that moved out when its permanent building was constructed.

“Since then, the property was lying vacant and the owner had applied to construct a new G+2 building on the same premise. He had sent the layout to the SCB engineering wing three months ago and was waiting for approval. As per the Cantonment Act, every layout has to pass by the board members through a resolution,” an assistant cantonment engineer with SCB, Balakrishna, told TOI.

However, the owner had not applied for a permission to demolish the building. The property was ravaged even before an SCB meeting could be convened, added Balakrishna. It is for SCB engineering wing to give permission for any demolition and issue precautionary and safety measures to be followed during the process.

Citing flouting the rules and regulations of Cantonment Act, we have decided to impose huge penalty against the property owner. This penalty will be decided by the CEO of Cantonment Board and will be served through a notice. The range of the penalty could be between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, the SCB official said.

Traffic went haywire on Karkhana-Secunderabad Club stretch between 8 am and 1 pm due to the incident. Traffic police swung into action to clear the area at the earliest.

163,['17/03/2020'],BJP MLAs show ‘Covid free’ certificates,"Congress MLAs wear mask in the assembly on Monday

Bhopal: Some of the BJP MLAs who returned for the assembly session on Monday carried health certificates that stated they were coronavirus-free.

The MP assembly has been adjourned till March 26 over Covid-19 scare — which gave a breather for the Kamal Nath led Congress government.

Not taking any chances and apprehending that they might be quarantined, some BJP MLAs carried health certificates to the Vidhan Sabha.

MP health minister Tarun Bhanot has stated that all people who have visited cities where Covid-19 cases have been confirmed, would undergo a health screening.

A certification from health department of BJP-ruled Karnataka was to provide a shield from screening and possible mandatory quarantine under Congress led-MP government. On Sunday, all Congress MLAs were screened for Covid-19 at a Bhopal after they returned from Jaipur.

Most of BJP MLAs have been staying in Gurugram for almost a week. Around 22-rebel Congress MLAs are in Bengaluru. On their return, it is expected they too would be screened for Covid-19.

State BJP vice president and MLA Arvind Singh Bhadoria who had recently visited Bengaluru, had one such certificate. The four-line letter was issued by the BJP-ruled Karnataka government’s directorate of health and family welfare services on March 13. His name handwritten on dotted line, stated ‘This is to certify……. has NO history of contact with suspected/confirmed case of Covid-19 patient. At present he/she is asymptomatic and free from Covid-19’. It was signed by joint director communicable diseases, Bengaluru.

Health is a state subject and MP government has already given magistrate like powers to its chief medical and health officers or CMHOs. Public gathering of more than 50 people requires permission from the CMHO. Also failure to self-declare visit to Covid-19 affected cities or locations or possible infection, is now a punishable offence as per health department notification.

NEW DELHI: Four months after retiring as Chief Justice of India, Justice Ranjan Gogoi was nominated as a member of Rajya Sabha by the President for his outstanding contribution in the field of law.

The decision was immediately criticised by Congress as controversial and undermining the judiciary.

Justice Gogoi is the first ex-CJI to get nominated to Rajya Sabha but the second, after ex-CJI Ranganath Misra, to become a member of the upper House of Parliament. Justice Misra was elected on a Congress ticket.

Justice Gogoi retired on November 18 and had headed a five-judge constitution bench that delivered the momentous and unanimous judgment deciding the 70-year-old litigation on ownership of the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land in Ayodhya in favour of Hindus. The SC had allotted five acres of land to Muslims at an alternative site for construction of a mosque.

He is the fourth among legal experts to get nominated by the President to Rajya Sabha after Fali S Nariman, K Parasaran and K T S Tulsi.

Speaking to TOI from Guwahati, Justice Gogoi said, ""I have accepted the President's decision to nomination me to Rajya Sabha as a member. It is an opportunity to put forth judiciary's point of view in Parliament. It is also an opportunity to put Parliament's point of view before the judiciary, provided they are willing to listen."" Asked whether he will join BJP, Justice Gogoi said, ""The question does not arise.""

Asked how he viewed his role as an RS member after a stint of nearly two decades as a judge of constitutional courts, the ex-CJI said, ""Judiciary and legislature are two important limbs and I will be privileged to endeavour and find a meeting point between the two which could carry the nation forward.""

In November last year, apart from heading the bench that decided the Ayodhya dispute, Justice Gogoi also headed the bench which put the SC's stamp of approval on the Rafale fighter jet deal between India and France.

Congress spokesperson and noted lawyer Abhishek Singhvi criticised the decision. “This not about Justice Gogoi. It is a most serious assault and undermining of judiciary. The misplaced reference to Justices M Hidayatullah and Ranganath Misra are glib talk by a superficial and ‘jumlebaaz’ government. The first was nine years after demitting office, the second after six years. There is a reason for cooling off in bureaucracy being one or two years. The nexus between incumbency and post-retirement largesse is sought to be severed. What we are seeing here is completely indefensible as it has happened in six months. Judiciary rests on faith, trust, perception and belief much more than reality. This will take a beating by the shocking decision,” he said.

Justice Misra was elected to the upper House on a Congress ticket after demitting office as head of National Human Rights Commission. Justice Hidayatullah presided over Rajya Sabha as vice-president from August 1979 to August 1984.

“All students are instructed to proceed to their homes with immediate effect and visit the institute website for futher instructions,” NIT Goa director Gopal Mugeraya said in the circular.

The circular states that NIT Goa is issuing the instructions as a precautionary measure to limit contact between people in view of the state government’s instructions to prevent the spread of the virus in Goa. The instructions have been issued to all heads of departments and wardens of hostels. On Monday, students had already begun leaving campus.

Meanwhile, the institute’s administrative staff have been asked to work online.

“All academic, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities are suspended till March 31, 2020,” the circular reads. “All officers and staff in administration will continue to discharge their official functions over the internet and whenever there is a need to be physically present in the institute, they would be required to do so. Officers and staff should always be available on phone/email for contact at any point of time for official work,” the circular reads.

Mugeraya has also said in the circular that the precautionary measures to limit the spread of the pandemic can only work “if everyone takes the instructions seriously”.

169,['17/03/2020'],Poultry farmers selling live birds at ‘dead’ rates,"Nagpur: Coronavirus outbreak is turning out to be a crisis worse than bird flu for the poultry industry. Poultry farmers say from Monday they sold live birds for as low as Rs6 each as some are ready to even give them away for free to the bulk traders.On the other hand, no impact was seen at the state government’s hatchery in the city. Officials at the centre said they have supplied 4,000 chicks in the last month which is usual.Farm owners claim they are staring at huge losses. Recently, a delegation had also met the NCP supremo Sharad Pawar seeking his help.After a steady decline finally when the market commenced on Monday the farmers had no takers for the birds. As practically no rates were quoted for the day, the farm owners were selling even at Rs3 a kg or Rs6 to 7 per bird. Each bird weighs between 2 to 2.25kg.At the neighbourhood chicken shops, the rates still continue to be in the range of Rs80 to 100 per kg. In some of the markets TOI ventured, it was as much as Rs120 a kg.Raja Dudhbade, chairman of Vidarbha Poultry Farmers Association, said that there are as much as 15,000 farms in the state This translates to over 5 crore birds in all. With each bird being sold at throwaway prices, the scale of crisis can be pegged easily.“It is profitable if the farmers sell a bird at anywhere between Rs75 to Rs80 a kg. The trouble began in February when rumours began doing rounds that chicken can cause coronavirus infection. This brought down rates to Rs60 a kg, which further slid to Rs30 and finally to even Rs3 a kg,” said Dudhbade.Earlier, the traders who purchased in bulk from farmers, sold it at around Rs80 to Rs81 a kg to the retail vendor who in turn sold it at Rs180 a kg. Trade sources said the bulk traders’ rates have gone down top Rs30 to Rs40 a kg. Retail rates continue to be in the range of Rs100, said trader, though demand is abysmally down.Amit Duddalwar, the association’s treasurer, who both runs a hatchery and poultry farm, said that in the normal course the farmer earned a profit of Rs10 on each bird. The loss is Rs100-120 a kg on an average in the last 30 days, he said.A farmer spends Rs100 to Rs130 a kg on the bird till it reaches the age of 40 days and is big enough to be slaughtered.Citing his own case, Duddalwar said he has ended up selling as much as six lakh birds at a loss in the last month. Another batch of six lakh will be 40 days old in a week. “It would be a massive loss if the rates do not improve,” he said and added, “It is worse for smaller farmers.”Farmers buy day old chicks and wait for 40 days at the most. It can extend till 60 days but after that the feed to weight ratio does not remain feasible.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74662881,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60962,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/poultry-farmers-selling-live-birds-at-dead-rates/articleshow/74662883.cms

Pankaj Ashiya, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Kalwan, said “If there are lakhs of people turning up, we won’t be able to maintain social distancing in this time of crisis. Also if there is a rumour about Covid-19 there can be a stampede-like situation. We have taken the decision in keeping such things in mind.”

NEW DELHI: Commuters travelling by Blue Line (Dwarka-Noida/ Vaishali) of Delhi Metro had to face a tough time on Monday due to delays during morning peak hour.

The delays were caused due to theft of signalling cables .

“Train services were regulated between Dwarka and Dwarka Sector 21 section of Blue Line from start of services in the morning till 11.30am. This was necessitated to re-lay a portion of signalling cable — approximately 25 metre long — which was found to be stolen and also to repair another portion of signalling cable around 13 metre long nearby, which bore cut marks,” a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) spokesman said.

“Some miscreants cut and stole these signalling cables on Up section of Blue line (going towards Dwarka Sector 21) i.e, between Dwarka Sector 9 and Dwarka Sector 10 stations on the night of March 15 and 16,” he said. “This resulted in multiple track circuit drop (signalling issue) in this section restricting trains to move in manual mode with limited speed of up to 25 kmph only,” he said.

To undertake the immediate restoration of cables and signalling in the section, trains were run on single line (Down Line) between Dwarka Sector 9 to Dwarka Sector 12 stations of the Blue line till 11.30 am, resulting into bunching of trains during peak hours and delays on the Dwarka-Dwarka Sector 21 section, DMRC said.

Bhopal: Only emergency surgeries would be entertained at tertiary care hospitals run by the state government — which will be on complete lockdown for treatment of confirmed Covid-19 patients, according to a senior official of the Directorate of Medical Education.

“All elective surgeries, except for extreme medical emergencies, would be held up. Only confirmed Covid-19 cases would be treated in medical college-run hospitals of the s. The new protocol, to stop all elective or planned surgeries, is to avoid risk of further transmission of the disease. “Medical college-run hospitals will be for treatment, not isolation. Quarantine and isolation are being handled by the health department,” he said. Hamidia hospital has a 10-bed facility for treatment of Covid-19 cases.

PPE, mask demand stabilises: After almost two weeks of scare, essentials like face masks and sanitisers are now available in the market. Panic buying over the last few days has led to a marginal increase in the cost of some medical products like N95 masks, said Lalit Jain, a medical supplies businessman.

“Ethical medial suppliers refused to get inventory like masks and sanitisers at inflated rates. The situation is much better now with the imposing of Essential Commodities Act,” said an MP FDA official. However, some of the hospitals are yet to reach comfortable levels of procuring basic medical support in case of Covid-19 patients increasing. “Cross-infection and transmission to health workers and others is a potential risk. Measures are in place to avoid it,” said Hamidia hospital superintendent, Dr AK Shrivastava.

“A mask is good for about six hours or less. Prolonged use of a mask can be unhealthy and increases the risk of other infections,” said Dr Rajiv Singh. Old aged, pregnant women and those with pre-existing conditions linked to COPD, are advised to minimise travel and stay away from large crowds.

Pathogen found 37 days after exposure: The WHO is warning of a longer than expected incubation period for Covid-19. An interim guidance released on March 13 by WHO could lead to increase in isolation, quarantine time period as followed by the health department. A Covid-19 pathogen respiratory tract was detected 37 days after contact, a new study found, suggesting that set incubation periods be many weeks.

The longest observed duration of virus shedding in survivors was 37 days, according to WHO’s interim guide for clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when Covid-19 disease is suspected. It was released on March 13. WHO cites Lancet’s reference of patients in Wuhan, China.

Till now, incubation period of Covid-19 is understood to be anywhere between 14-28 days.

Pregnant women concerned about exposure or symptoms indicating possible infection with Covid-19 are also being warned, said a consultant with the health department.

174,['17/03/2020'],BJP MLAs show ‘Covid free’ certificates,"Bhopal: Some of the BJP MLAs who returned for the assembly session on Monday carried health certificates that stated they were coronavirus-free.

The MP assembly has been adjourned till March 26 over Covid-19 scare — which gave a breather for the Kamal Nath led Congress government.

Not taking any chances and apprehending that they might be quarantined, some BJP MLAs carried health certificates to the Vidhan Sabha.

MP health minister Tarun Bhanot has stated that all people who have visited cities where Covid-19 cases have been confirmed, would undergo a health screening.

A certification from health department of BJP-ruled Karnataka was to provide a shield from screening and possible mandatory quarantine under Congress led-MP government. On Sunday, all Congress MLAs were screened for Covid-19 at a Bhopal after they returned from Jaipur.

Most of BJP MLAs have been staying in Gurugram for almost a week. Around 22-rebel Congress MLAs are in Bengaluru. On their return, it is expected they too would be screened for Covid-19.

State BJP vice president and MLA Arvind Singh Bhadoria who had recently visited Bengaluru, had one such certificate. The four-line letter was issued by the BJP-ruled Karnataka government’s directorate of health and family welfare services on March 13. His name handwritten on dotted line, stated ‘This is to certify……. has NO history of contact with suspected/confirmed case of Covid-19 patient. At present he/she is asymptomatic and free from Covid-19’. It was signed by joint director communicable diseases, Bengaluru.

Health is a state subject and MP government has already given magistrate like powers to its chief medical and health officers or CMHOs. Public gathering of more than 50 people requires permission from the CMHO. Also failure to self-declare visit to Covid-19 affected cities or locations or possible infection, is now a punishable offence as per health department notification.

Most homestays have stopped taking bookings and plan to shut down till the pandemic situation subsides. Homestay owners association said the dip in business and fear of viral infections force the establishments to close down and more than 70% of homestays in the area will be closed soon.“The business has been affected greatly due to the decline in footfall of foreigners. But now with many countries becoming affected by the virus and several foreigners under home quarantine in Kerala, it is not safe to allow accommodation of tourists unlike before. The dip in business can be compensated but the fear of getting infected is raised as a challenge by many owners. There is no official directive from the association to shut hotels. But many have already pulled down the shutters of their homestays on their own,” said tourism promoters’ association president Antony Kureethra.Moreover, homestay owners alleged that authorities have not given any official guidelines regarding how to handle foreign guests, and fake messages on social media and WhatsApp about ‘government regulations’ are misleading them. They also opposed the government's directive to foreigners to undergo self-quarantine at their place of stay in the wake of feverish symptoms as it will put the safety of staff at stake.“We have been informing the police and health officials whenever a new foreigner checks-in. But if a foreigner has feverish symptoms, they will be asked to stay in quarantine at the homestay itself for 14 or 28 days. This is uncomfortable for the staff and others guests. Why cannot the government take them to an isolated place instead of our homestays for the quarantine? It is risky to operate the homestay in the unsafe situation. The last guest at my homestay will check-out tonight and I will shut down the operation after that,” a homestay owner at Fort Kochi said on Monday.According to homestay operators, there are at least 100 tourists, mostly foreigners, who have already been staying at their homestays. “We face difficulties in handling those who already stay with us. So, some of the homestay owners would send off the tourists,” said Kureethra. “There are instances in which local residents object to the foreigners moving around in their locality,” he said.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/homestays-to-down-shutters-for-now/articleshow/74662809.cms

Kanpur: Taking serious note of the outbreak of coronavirus, IIT-Kanpur administration, after suspending classes for students and cancelling annual technical festival 'Techkriti', has now asked the students to vacate the hostels.

The institute is taking several precautions to ensure that no student, faculty member, staff or visitors get infected by the virus. Since faculty members and students often travel to different countries for pursuing academic tasks, chances remain high that they may fall victim to the deadly coronavirus.

The institute administration suspects that the spread of virus will increase over the next week or two. ""It may lead to a situation in which the institute has to get the hostels vacated. To avoid such a scenario in which a large number of students will have to be vacated with shortage of transport facilities, the task force constituted on Monday recommended gradual reduction of students in the hostels"", said deputy director of the institute Prof Manindra Agarwal.

The instructions issued to the students by Prof Agarwal state that all undergraduate, MBA, and first year M Tech/MDes/MS (name of different courses) students are required to vacate the hostels by March 19. Only PhD, second year MTech/MDes/MS and fifth year dual degree students, who are already in the campus, have been permitted to stay in the hostels after March 19.

For PG students, who are away from the campus, special leave will be provided to them, he said.

In case any PhD, second year MTech/MDes/MS and fifth year dual segree student wishes to leave the campus, special leave will be provided for the same.

In addition to this, some other protocols are also being adopted which include cancellation of all bookings for social functions in Community Centre-I and Ashiana that involve visitors from outside.

The retired employees coming to the health centre to get regular medicines should report to the help desk set up in front of the centre between 10am and 12 noon, said Prof Agarwal. Their booklets will be deposited and medicines delivered to them through the desk, he added.

The specialist OPD, being run at the health centre, is being suspended from Tuesday until further notice.

Elderly people and children should go to the health centre only if it is essential as they are most susceptible to infections, he said

Sathish Kumar told his seniors in the station that there was no altercation at the guesthouse and recorded it in the general dairy in the station.

Meanwhile, Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi, who made a surprise visit to Grand Bazaar police station on Monday following the incident, directed the senior superintendent of police (law and order) Rahul Alwal to expedite the investigation and initiate action based on its outcome.

Bedi also directed Alwal to initiate efforts to nab the absconding constables and invoke all necessary sections against them as done for any other absconding accused. She urged the director-general of police Balaji Srivastava to evolve a standard operating procedure to enable the policemen to deal with the crimes involving policemen. She suggested that women cops must be a part of the teams involved in raids against prostitution.

Bedi later visited the IRBn office and found that the premise has been in a ‘neglected state’. She found that the supervisory officers have failed to take roll call briefings and decided to raise the issues with the senior officials concerned.

186,['17/03/2020'],Prisoners scanned before entering jail,"Nashik: The officials at the Nashik Road central prison have started checking the temperature of new undertrials and prisoners before they are allowed inside the jail.

The prison officials said the jail doctor checks the temperature of 25-30 new inmates that come to the jail every day. According to jailor Pramod Wagh, this initiative has been undertaken as a precautionary measure.

“In case any new inmate has fever, we would be directly sending them to the Nashik civil hospital for further treatment. But so far no new inmate had fever,” he added.

The jail authorities have also stopped sending the undertrials to the court for hearings.

“We already have video-conferencing facility in the jail. In order to avoid taking inmates to the court, we have decided that all the hearings will take place on video conferencing. This will reduce the chances of infection,” the jailor told TOI.

The Nashik jail authorities have also made nearly 2,500 face masks in the past one week and have distributed the same to their staff members.

“A team of 12 inmates were deployed to make the masks. The inmates make more than 300 masks per day which costs Rs 14 in the market. Since we do not have much demand from outside, we did not make them on a large scale. The jail employees are given the masks as a preventive measure for now,” said Wagh.

PANAJI: Some schools on Monday decided to cancel their final exams for the 2019-20 academic year from Class I to VIII, as a precautionary measure in view of coronavirus (Covid-19) concerns. These institutes may decide to evaluate students based on their performance in the continuous comprehensive evaluation. The Class IX exam, however, will be held as scheduled. Other institutes are expected to follow suit as parents have demanded that exams to be called off to ensure safety of students.

“Parents of students from Class I to VIII are informed that there will be no final exams for their wards,” headmistress of Mapusa’s Saraswat Vidyalaya told parents in a notice issued on Monday.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant, after chairing a meeting, announced last week that regular classes in schools have been suspended till March 31. However, he said, examinations would go on as scheduled. Following this, concerned parents took to social media and also began appealing to schools to cancel the exams altogether upto Class VIII as the Right to Education Act has a no-fail policy in force till this class.

“These are internal exams and not crucial state board exams. The children have already appeared for the continuous comprehensive evaluation exams and the school was requested to carry out averaging to assess them. Also, the students, upto Class V, are very young and vulnerable and sit close to each other,” said a parent of a child studying in a Dona Paula school.

While some schools have refused to cancel exams pointing to Sawant’s instructions that school exams can go on as scheduled, other institutes are mulling over parents’ requests.“If teachers are required to attend school daily; if they are travelling by public transport and then hold exams for children, what’s the of this half-hearted piecemeal approach of the administration?” asked a parent.

In many state schools, the exam for primary institutes ended on Monday.

In most state board-affiliated schools, it will be high school students who will be answering their exams.

189,['17/03/2020'],Hosps put off surgeries to make room for Covid cases,"Bhopal: Only emergency surgeries would be entertained at tertiary care hospitals run by the state government — which will be on complete lockdown for treatment of confirmed Covid-19 patients, according to a senior official of the Directorate of Medical Education.

“All elective surgeries, except for extreme medical emergencies, would be held up. Only confirmed Covid-19 cases would be treated in medical college-run hospitals of the s. The new protocol, to stop all elective or planned surgeries, is to avoid risk of further transmission of the disease. “Medical college-run hospitals will be for treatment, not isolation. Quarantine and isolation are being handled by the health department,” he said. Hamidia hospital has a 10-bed facility for treatment of Covid-19 cases.

PPE, mask demand stabilises: After almost two weeks of scare, essentials like face masks and sanitisers are now available in the market. Panic buying over the last few days has led to a marginal increase in the cost of some medical products like N95 masks, said Lalit Jain, a medical supplies businessman.

“Ethical medial suppliers refused to get inventory like masks and sanitisers at inflated rates. The situation is much better now with the imposing of Essential Commodities Act,” said an MP FDA official. However, some of the hospitals are yet to reach comfortable levels of procuring basic medical support in case of Covid-19 patients increasing. “Cross-infection and transmission to health workers and others is a potential risk. Measures are in place to avoid it,” said Hamidia hospital superintendent, Dr AK Shrivastava.

“A mask is good for about six hours or less. Prolonged use of a mask can be unhealthy and increases the risk of other infections,” said Dr Rajiv Singh. Old aged, pregnant women and those with pre-existing conditions linked to COPD, are advised to minimise travel and stay away from large crowds.

Pathogen found 37 days after exposure: The WHO is warning of a longer than expected incubation period for Covid-19. An interim guidance released on March 13 by WHO could lead to increase in isolation, quarantine time period as followed by the health department. A Covid-19 pathogen respiratory tract was detected 37 days after contact, a new study found, suggesting that set incubation periods be many weeks.

The longest observed duration of virus shedding in survivors was 37 days, according to WHO’s interim guide for clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) when Covid-19 disease is suspected. It was released on March 13. WHO cites Lancet’s reference of patients in Wuhan, China.

Till now, incubation period of Covid-19 is understood to be anywhere between 14-28 days.

Pregnant women concerned about exposure or symptoms indicating possible infection with Covid-19 are also being warned, said a consultant with the health department.

There is no business at most shops and nearly half a dozen shops have temporarily stopped functioning.Ayub Khan, a trader at Connemara market, said that business has been witnessing a sharp decline since demonetization. “For the past two months, there is not much business here. After Covid-19 cases were reported, many traders have temporarily closed shops and sent staff on leave,” he said.Another trader, Shaju, said that his textile shop now employs only two workers against the previous count of seven.He said that all traders in the district are affected.Chalai bazaar, one of the most vibrant markets in the district, too is severely affected. Abdul Majid, treasurer of Vyapari Vyavasayi Samiti at Chalai, said that footfall has dropped after government announced closure of educational institutions due to spread of Covid-19. “It is a very serious issue. All traders are affected. Some traders told me that it would be great if they could at least pay salaries of staff,” he said.Majid said that it was difficult to take protective measures like wearing of gloves or masks as people would fear entering the shops.“We look forward to March and April as it is the time of temple festivals and marriages. However, due to regulations in assembly of people in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, such programmes are being called off and our sales have dipped. We have been forced to cut down on our orders due to reduction in sales,” said Mohammad Siddique, a trader based in Chalai and vice-president of merchants’ union, Chalai-Kothuval unit.Susheela, a vegetable vendor of Palayam market, said that she had to destroy huge quantities of decayed vegetables as there were only a few buyers. “How long will this last? No one is coming to the market. Many shops were shut and staff are sent on leave,” she said.Fish vendors too are hit. “I come to the market at 8am and return after sales by noon.

191,['17/03/2020'],"Exports begin: Halcon sends out 3,600 tonne","Nashik: The export of onions has begun from Inland Container Depot (ICD) and air cargo complex of Halcon — a joint venture between Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) and Container Corporation of India (Concor).

Around 3,600 tonne of onions had been exported by Halcon till Monday to Colombo and Middle Eastern countries.

The onions containers from Nashik are sent by road to JNPT in Mumbai and, thereafter, exported by sea to these countries.

The central government had imposed a ban on onion export on September 29 last year in order to stabilise the rising wholesale onion prices in the markets across the country.

After four-and-a-half months, the Centre decided to lift the ban on onion exports with effect from March 15.

As customer clearance process is carried out at the ICD in Ozar (near Nashik city) most of the exporters prefer sending their consignments via Halcon in order to save time and money. The containers are exported directly via JNPT Mumbai. Halcon has developed Inland Container Depot and air cargo complex from where onions, grapes, pomegranate and fresh vegetables and processed foods are being exported.

In 2018-19, around 1.04 lakh tonne of onions worth Rs 154 crore were exported from Halcon, but the number dropped during the current financial year by 40.77% to 61,593 tonne worth Rs 113 crore between April 1 and March 15 of the current financial year due to ban on export. tnn

But even this low price is not reason enough to attract buyers, with vendors reporting a nearly 30% drop in sales.While there is no evidence, yet, that Covid-19 could spread due to chicken consumption, buyers say the suspected cases of bird flu being reported from various parts of Kerala are making them apprehensive to consume poultry.Siolim-based Rixon John Fernandes said retail rates have dropped to Rs 90 and the current wholesale rate is just Rs 60. “But the fear psychosis has drastically brought down sales. On Sundays, we would usually sell nearly 300 chickens, but on March 15, we sold less than 100 birds,” he said.At the Al Madina cold storage and the Jai Bhavani chicken store in Panaji, the store managers were seen idling away time while waiting for buyers to make their purchases before they could start their work.The slow movement of the birds has further dented traders’ budgets as they have to maintain them for a longer time. “We spend Rs 5,000 a day on feed, but with the sales down, managing our budget to maintain the birds is becoming problematic,” one vendor said.Interestingly, the price of frozen broilers remained largely unchanged. At Royal Foods on Monday, a broiler was priced at Rs 129 per kilo. At Magsons Supercenter, Taleigao, the same was selling at Rs 145 per kg.Mutton and beef sales though have remained unaffected. “Our sales are intact.

193,['17/03/2020'],Vacation-happy students taking corona shutdown for a ride,"Bhopal: The lockdown of colleges due to coronavirus scare could not come at a better time, says engineering student Vikas Sharma. The weather is ideal for a vacation and he and his 10 friends have already packed their bags for Shimla, he says.

While Vikas is getting ready for his trip, the authorities have recommended against attending or hosting crowded events, in an effort to contain the pandemic. Most schools, colleges, universities and cultural institutions have been shut down, at least for the next 15 days. Only exams are being conducted in educational institutions as of now.

Experts have recommended that residents practice social distancing, but the students of Bhopal have other ideas — which might not be ideal in a time when India lives in the shadow of a Covid outbreak.

Instead of taking precautions and avoiding gatherings, the students are using this “free time” to go on vacation and planning get-togethers. “What is wrong if we go to a hill station where Covid cases have not been reported and also take all possible precaution. We have stocked up on masks and sanitisers to keep coronavirus away,” said Vikas.

Another student Shrikant Verma agreed. “What should we do at home for the next 15 days?” he said.

Those students who are staying back in the city have made plans for get-togethers. A medical student Nisha Yada said, “I do not want to waste these off days which we get so rarely. My friends and I have planned a party at night.”

Experts say, social distancing is an attempt to enforce distance between people and is a proven way to slow pandemics. The idea is for people to make reasonable modifications in their lifestyle to minimise risk of infections.

Educational institutions in Bhopal are spreading awareness among their staff and students. Universities and colleges have also stepped up to contain the risk of coronavirus, for those students who are coming to appear for exams. “We have sanitisers in every class. We are making the students and teachers aware about the virus and the steps they should take to tackle it,” said BU registrar B Bharti. Teachers have also warned students against meeting outside.

“We are trying our best to make the students aware that it is not good for them to go to crowded areas or hold large gatherings. We are telling them about the precautions that must be followed,” said a faculty member at BU.

“Since this virus spreads through contact, social distancing is a very simple way to avoid physical contact with the carrier of virus. No positive case has been reported in Bhopal and there is no need to panic. But people should be safe and exercise caution. Coronavirus is a pandemic and people, specially students should take it seriously,” say experts.

GFX:

What is social distancing?

Social distancing is maintaining a distancing between you and other people to minimise contact.

What should be done?

Avoid public transportation whenever possible, limit non-essential travel, work from home and skip social gatherings.

What to do at home during social distancing?

Stream shows/movies, instead of meeting have a video chat with friends, find a new hobby or pick up the old one again.

More than the government’s response, our personal actions are going to count in tackling the pandemic

BHUBANESWAR: Odisha Police on Monday warned of legal action against people, especially Covid-19-affected persons and their families, if they were found responsible for spreading the killer virus in the state.

The state’s first coronavirus positive case was detected in Bhubaneswar on Sunday.

In a circular, the state police headquarters has asked all superintendents of police (SPs) to invoke sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease and dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease) of the IPC against those whose negligence and irresponsible conduct might spread the virus.

“We will initiate legal action against those whose negligent, malignant actions and irresponsibility will spread coronavirus. The SPs have been asked to invoke the law, if the situation warrants. The commissionerate police will prescribe regulations in the wake of the outbreak of any epidemic disease,” DGP Abhay said.

The Uttar Pradesh Police on Sunday booked a coronavirus-affected woman’s father in Agra for alleged negligence and subsequent spread of the deadly virus.

While no person has so far been booked under sections 269 and 270 of the IPC in Odisha, police last week arrested two persons in different places for allegedly spreading rumours on the novel coronavirus. While Rayagada Police arrested a youth on March 13 for posting rumours on social media, Kalahandi Police arrested a schoolteacher on March 15 for sharing a fake message on coronavirus.

“We have asked our personnel to take adequate precautions while enforcing different laws and orders to combat coronavirus and prevent its spread in the state. The SPs have been asked to immediately respond to the crisis and closely coordinate with district collectors on enforcement of orders and restrictions,” another police officer said.

The state government on March 13 described Covid-19 as a state disaster and ordered closure of theatres, shopping malls and educational institutions. The state police headquarters said the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, would be invoked for proper promulgation of the Odisha Covid-19 Regulations, 2020, under which anyone not going into isolation or failing to get admitted to a hospital over a suspected case of coronavirus might be prosecuted under IPC Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), which has a maximum jail term of six months.

This woman is from the group of 40 people that had been to Dubai between February 24 and March 2. Her latest samples were sent to IGGMCH Nagpur on Saturday evening.

Yavatmal district collector M Devendra Singh confirmed this. “On Saturday, we had sent two swab samples. One of them was of this woman, who earlier had been tested negative. Now, she has been found positive. Another sample was a fresh case having Dubai travel history, which was found negative,” he said while adding that the isolation ward of Yavatmal GMCH now has three positive patients.

This is arguably the first case in India where a suspect earlier tested negative but developed symptoms and then tested positive. This proves that novel coronavirus symptoms can develop anytime within 14 days of infection and hence the quarantine period is necessary.

Apart from this positive case in Yavatmal, no new positive case was reported on Monday in Vidarbha. Samples of 12 female and 1 male suspect were sent for testing. All 13 of them were admitted to the isolation ward. Results of all 13 cases along with 5 samples submitted on Sunday are still awaited.

“Out of the 13 suspects admitted on Monday, one has travel history to Nepal and another has come back from Russia. Rest 11 are close contacts of the positive patients already admitted in GMCH,” said a senior official.

With 13 suspects admitted on Monday, and five suspects awaiting results from Sunday evening, Yavatmal GMCH Isolation ward now has total 18 patients, apart from three positive patients. Doctors treating these patients said they are stable and asymptomatic. Doctors are observing their general health parameters on regular basis.

Meanwhile, Nagpur municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe informed that the quarantine facility in the MLA Hostel is ready. “Apart from seven high risk nations notified by Government of India, the state government has decided to keep travellers coming from USA, Saudi Arabia and Dubai in the quarantine facility under observation for 24 hours,” he said.

The state has added these three nations to the list of China, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Iran, and South Korea, because three positive patients found in Nagpur had travel history of USA and three positive patients admitted in Yavatmal have travel history of Dubai. Many suspects are coming from Saudi too.

Four suspects admitted in isolation ward of Chandrapur GMCH have also tested negative. “Health department here has so far tested a total of 33 people, including 16 having history of foreign travel and all of them have tested negative,” said guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar, who also handles disaster management ministry in the state. Wadettiwar reviewed the coronavirus situation and preventive measures by the district administration on Monday.

Meanwhile, 17 students from Chandrapur stuck at Gulburga, also known as Kalaburagi, where the first coronavirus death of India was reported, returned home safely on Sunday and Monday. Waddettiwar facilitated their return to Chandrapur. They all were kept quarantined and checked for Covid-19, and tested negative before being allowed to come to Chandrapur, district collector Dr Kunal Khemnar said.

Farmers, however, had expected the price to go up due to the re-commencement of the onion exports. Therefore, they rushed to the market with the produce to get better rates.

Around 20,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at the Lasalgaon APMC on Monday, against auction of 10,000 quintal on Saturday, said APMC sources.

The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 900 and Rs 1,780 per quintal, respectively, on Monday.

Plantation of the late kharif onions has increased upto 45,000 hectares, against 30,000 hectares last year.

The average wholesale onion prices have dropped by almost 81% to Rs 1,600 per quintal in past three months due to a rise in supply in comparison to the demand.

Meanwhile, the Maharashtra state onion growers’ association has appealed to the farmers to not bring their entire stock to the market in one go. The aim is to prevent a glut in the market and subsequent crashing of onion prices.

“We have told the farmers to not bring onions at one time so that the wholesale prices do not crash,” said Bharat Dighole, president of the association.

The Centre had recently also lifted the stock limits on wholesale and retail onion traders. In September, the Centre had imposed stock limits of 500 quintal for wholesalers and 100 quintal for retailers. Thereafter, around one-and-a-half-months ago, the Centre had reduced the stock limit to 250 quintal for wholesalers and 50 quintal for retailers.

CHENNAI: At least 20 passengers who landed at the Chennai airport from seven countries on Monday were taken to a government quarantine centre – a health department training centre in Ponnamallee — by the directorate of public health and family welfare.

Coronavirus outbreak live updates

The centre, which can board 50 people, is now acting as a quarantine centre for passengers coming from China, Democratic Republic of Korea, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Iran, as per the new protocol issued by the Union health ministry. “As per the new protocol, those with flu-like symptoms will be sent to hospitals for isolation. But those who are above 60 years or those who have hypertension, diabetes or asthma will be monitored daily for 14 days in the quarantine centre even if they don’t have symptoms,” joint director of public health Dr P Sampath said. For people in this category, the collectors have identified buildings that can accommodate up to 100 people in each district. In Chennai, a new building is coming up at the Tambaram sanatorium.

From Wednesday, the compulsory quarantine will extend to passengers coming from/transiting through UAE, Qatar, Oman, and Kuwait. The centre has said that travel of passengers from member countries of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association , Turkey and United Kingdom to India is prohibited from Wednesday.

The health team is also briefing people in the low risk category about symptoms, precautions and need for home quarantine. They will be monitored by the integrated disease surveillance programme network for a fortnight.

On Monday, the state saw the highest number of people under hospital isolation. The state recorded 22 people under hospital isolation and 2,221 others who were on 28-day home quarantine. “On Monday, we took maximum number of samples from passengers who were showing symptoms. Doctors at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGH) took 32 samples on Monday, taking the total number of samples to 128,” said health minister C Vijaya Baskar. The condition of the Covid-positive patient admitted to the RGGH is stable, he said.

Sample is taken when passengers who have a travel history or people who came in contact with Covid- positive patients show symptoms of the disease. “Besides this, as per the standard guidelines, we have done random screening of 22 patients who were admitted at the hospital. All of them tested negative,” he said. Besides King Institute for preventive medicine in Guindy, the state has increased the number of testing centres at Theni, Tiruvarur and Tirunelvelli. “Chennai will get its second lab in RGGH,” he said. Besides airports, screening is being done at seaports and railway stations, he said.

203,['17/03/2020'],Smart city body cancels rent-a-bicycle project,"Nashik: The public bicycle sharing project has been stopped in the city after one-and-a-half years of operation due to lack of maintenance of the bicycles and diminishing public response.

“The contract has been terminated with the private firm that was responsible for operating the public sharing cycle project on private-public partnership (PPP) basis,” Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) officials said on Monday.

The project, also known as rent-a-cycle, was launched in October 2018, and the private agency had deployed 1,000 bicycles with 100 docking stations.

Earlier, it received a good response, but due to lack of proper maintenance of cycles, citizens avoided it later.

“The smart city corporation tried its best to run the bicycle sharing project but the private firm failed to maintain and operate them, leading to poor response from citizens. We have finally terminated the contract with the private firm,” said officials.

The land for the cycle stations had been provided by the municipal corporation while a private firm made the investment in the project. The objective was to promote cycling as a means of transport within the city because it is environment-friendly and good for health.

Initially, there were around 900 cycles, but it the number was reduced to 100 in the recent past due to lack of response from citizens. The rent was nominal.

In view of the a poor response from citizens, the NMSCDCL had joined hands with Nashik Cyclists Foundation (NCF), a city-based association of cyclists, to promote the project.

Despite trying to create awareness and making Sunday as ‘Bicycle Day’, the response from citizens continued to be poor.

They include flights to Jaffna and Doha from yesterday. Flights to Singapore, London and some destinations in the Middle East continue to operate at reduced frequency and with 50% patronage. Batik Air cancelled its flights to Kuala Lumpur on Monday.A senior official of Airports Authority of India (AAI) said there was a drop of around 30% on footfalls at the international terminals. However, the terminal may be in for a complete shutdown in the next few days as India has issued an advisory that no airlines should pick passengers from Europe.On Monday, the international terminal looked deserted with the flight information display board showing most of the flights as cancelled. The food and beverages shops outside the building that cater to the people who come to receive passengers looked empty and dusty. As India has suspended visas, travellers who land the airport are Indians who are returning. “This will also go down because many, including students in the US and Canada, have decided to stay back,” said an official.Airlines are also canceling international flights at other airports. The Kuala Lumpur-bound Air Asia and Malindo Air and Colombo-bound Sri Lankan Airlines have suspended their services for a brief period from Trichy international airport.Most of the retail and food and beverages shops at the international terminal have shut down because of poor footfalls. Owners of retailers and food and beverage shops have asked AAI to waive licence fee for a month or till the flight schedules turn normal. Every unit pays a fixed amount of Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh a month to the airport.However, AAI is yet to take a decision either to shut the terminal or offer a waiver. “AAI headquarters have to take a decision on the waiver. We have been sending reports about footfall and flight cancellations to Delhi,” said an official.Though most of the domestic flights are being operated, many see fewer passengers per day. “The check-ins are going down by the day and there are not much crowd at the domestic terminal on morning peak hours,” an airline staff said. Chennai-Port Blair flights will be hit as Port Blair administration has issued an order banning tourists into the island for a week.Domestic arrivals too have dipped. A staff at the prepaid taxi counter said there was a drop in demand for taxi by around 50%.The uncertainty in travelling due to spread of Covid-19 across many countries has led to airfares dipping for flights from Chennai to UK and the US for travel in April. Return tickets from the US are selling at Rs 50,000 to Rs 80,000 and fares to London via Abu Dhabi and Dubai are at Rs 40,000.

Nagpur: The fear of coronavirus has led to cancellation or postponement of marriages , corporate events and other family functions.

Wedding halls or lawns will remain shut until March 31, stated Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC).

TOI spoke to a few wedding planners, event management companies and halls managers to get a feel of the situation.

Nilay Verma, who runs an event management company, said, “We have cancelled a big public event amid the fear of coronavirus. We were supposed to hold a stand-up comedy event which was called off recently,” he said.

One of the major hurdles for cancelling weddings is that the groom and bride are coming from abroad. They are either unable to get flights or are facing issues of visa suspension.

“We were all set to host the wedding for our client but the groom faced a technical glitch while travelling from Dubai. Flights, too, were cancelled and hence, the wedding had to be postponed. We don’t know when it will take place,” said Sohail Ramteke from Precious Jodi, a wedding management firm.

Promod Joshi, manager at Bhagwati Lawns, Trimurthy Nagar, said, “People do not want to engage in public gatherings, especially after positive cases of coronavirus were detected in the city. We have cancelled bookings for weddings and corporate events,” he said.

Wedding planners and hall owners are taking the situation in the right spirit. For them, the well-being of their clients is more important than business. “Business is an ongoing process. It will continue once the fear of the coronavirus is gone. While two bookings were cancelled, two functions were postponed.” said Gulshan Datre, who runs Badhai, am event management company.

Meanwhile, there are some who are holding ceremonies limited to near and dear ones only. “I attended a wedding which was a low-key affair. Some are going ahead with their functions in the presence of family, close friends and relatives,” said Ashish Shankhwar.

Would-be groom Rohit Bisen had made elaborate plans for his big day, right from sangeet to mehndi. But bookings done before had to be cancelled and now, the event is going to be an extended family affair.

“We had to cancel the bookings for the sangeet and other functions related to the wedding. Though there is nothing much to worry about, a little fear does exist. We are playing it safe by conducting all the rituals in the presence of close family and friends,” he said.

They allege that other foreign-returned probationers of the same group were interacting with mess authorities and sanitary staff openly in the hostel, risking lives of others.

""I think they do not understand the meaning of quarantine. They should be confined to their rooms and not risk others’ safety,"" said a senior professor from FRI premises requesting anonymity. IGNFA officials say that the ones who had gone to Spain were under self-quarantine but those who came back from Russia were not under any compulsion to stay in quarantine. However, they added that an advisory was released for all of them to stay indoors as a precautionary measure.

“The ones that had gone to Russia were not under strict quarantine because the ministry of health doesn’t have Russia in the list of the 12 countries that require quarantine. However, we had already given them an advisory to stay indoors as a precautionary measure,” said SK Awasthi, ADG of IGNFA.

When asked about probationers interacting with mess staff and sanitary staff, Awasthi said, ““Even before the group from Spain had landed in Delhi, we had informed the health authorities about their arrival. The health officials supervised everything. They have stayed inside the hostel which is a quarantine zone.”

Notably, samples of six probationers (out of 62) have been sent for Covid-19 test. All six of them had reported some health condition. “We will now collect samples of the 26 trainee IFS officers who have returned from Spain,” said Dr Dinesh Chauhan, ACMO of Dehradun.

Sources have told TOI that the number of students in a room may be restricted to only 12 from the current cap of 24. This change is going to be put into effect for exams scheduled for March 17 and 18. On Tuesday, the big ticket Maths paper for Std XII is scheduled.

According to the plan, a minimum distance of one metre has to be kept between two candidates. Only one invigilator will be appointed for one room of 12 candidates.

As per sources, the schools have already been informed to get plan going in the best interest of students. The schools have been told to “treat this message as urgent” and start work of preparing seating arrangements in the hall.

A parent, who is also a CBSE schoolteacher, told TOI that this move by CBSE will make a big difference. “Board exams have to be conducted and I think this is the best way to go about it. Initially, CBSE allowed our kids to take face masks and hand sanitizers. Now, this lessening the density of students per classroom will give a boost to the preventive campaign,” said the parent.

Though the message came late in the evening, schools were not complaining. A teacher said, “We understand that the coronavirus situation is a fast developing thing. So, this sudden announcements are expected.

There are at least 50 national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in the state. The most popular tiger reserves, including Pench, Tadoba-Andhari, Navegaon-Nagzira, Bor, Melghat and other parks, will remain closed now.

Kakodkar said, “Tadoba and other parks will remain closed from March 18 to 31. Money will be refunded to those who had made advance bookings.”

TATR core and buffer zone have 19 tourism gates from where at least 200 vehicles enter the park daily. TATR always pulls crowd and considering the volume, crores of rupees will have to be refunded.

“Not only Tadoba, closure of parks will also mean loss of employment to guides and gypsy owners, and indirect employment to locals for 15 days during the peak tourism season,” said Anil Tiwade, president, Maharashtra Guides Union.

Kakodkar said a decision has also been taken to close coastal and marine biodiversity centre at Airoli in Navi Mumbai and flamingo safari in Thane Creek.

The decision comes close on the heels of three wildlife sanctuaries, Tipeshwar (Yavatmal), Radhanagari (Kolhapur) and Sagareswar (Sangli) shutting down, closure orders for which were issued a day earlier.

“As orders to close these parks were issued early by the respective officials, tourism in these parks will be closed from March 17 till March 31, 2020,” said Kakodkar.

Kakodkar said the decision to close the parks was taken after district collectors, who are also chairpersons of the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), invoked Disaster Management Act, which was difficult to implement.

“We did not have expertise to implement many of the directives issued by the DDMA. Hence, it was decided to close the parks as matter of precaution, basically to avoid mass gathering in wildlife areas till the disease is contained,” said Kakodkar.

As many foreign tourists visit Tadoba, Chandrapur district collector Dr Kunal Khemnar had called a meeting of resort and lodge owners at Agarzari on March 13, to tell them about the dos and don’ts.

Based on this meeting, TATR field director NR Praveen on Monday morning directed all resort owners to use thermal scanners to identify suspected coronavirus patients.

Even as resort owners were in a fix due to non-availability of thermal scanners, in the evening PCCF (wildlife) issued orders to close the parks completely for tourism.

One of the stakeholders, Nikhil Abhyankar, welcomed the move. “The decision is in the larger interests of society and will help contain the spread of the dreaded virus. Hope the department releases full refund during the closure period,” said Abhyankar.

Pramod Bhoyar, a resort owner, welcomed the move. “As exams are over we were getting calls for bookings but we discouraged people as slightest of mistake would have landed all the people in trouble,” he said.

In order to prevent any accidental spread of coronavirus states like Kerala, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Assam have taken the lead in stopping tourism in all parks.

213,['17/03/2020'],"Delhi Coronavirus Update: Over six hours at IGI without water or food, no access to washrooms","NEW DELHI: Passengers arriving at Indira Gandhi International Aiport from seven countries — China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, France, Spain and Germany — after February 15 have been put on a ‘mandatory’ 14-day quarantine by the Union health ministry. But because of lack of clarity amongst health authorities and airport staff on where each passenger will be accommodated for their quarantine process, people are complaining about having to wait for over six hours at the airport and even longer in some cases.TOI spoke to several such passengers on Monday, who had to endure a harrowing time, beginning at Delhi airport and culminating at a government quarantine facility which many said lacked basic sanitation and hygiene — primarily dirty toilets. Providing clean facilities was the least they could expect from the government was the refrain.People complained that at the airport they were made to sit on the floor. No passenger was provided food or water and had no access to washrooms.Nupur Sharma, who stays in Paris with her husband, had been planning to invite her brother and father to the city in March while her mother, Rama Sharma, was already staying with her. With the city now in a semi-lockdown state, Sharma says she decided to send her mother back to India, a decision she now regrets.“My mother’s flight reached the Delhi airport around 9am and she was made to sit on the floor and wait. While we were mentally prepared for her to be put in a quarantine, we did not expect such treatment. She was not provided any food or water or allowed to go to the washroom. Those who may have been carrying the virus may have infected the rest as they were made to sit together for hours,” said Sharma, claiming that they eventually left the airport after 6pm.“The passports had been seized the moment they reached and after that there was no information. People who were asking for food were told to wait and that they could ‘survive’ without food for a few hours,” said Sharma, whose mother was kept under quarantine at a hospital in Gurgaon before being tested negative. She was later discharged around 11.30pm on Monday.Viren’s daughter, who too was flying from Paris, suffered a similar fate, leaving the airport at 6:30 pm. She too was sent to the Gurugram medical centre after going without food and water for hours. “Food was provided at the facility around 9 pm. They are being made to sleep in a hall that has beds next to each other and even those who don’t have the virus may get it.” That seemed to be a common worry.Another passenger, speaking to TOI on condition of anonymity, said he flew into Delhi from Frankfurt, reaching the airport around 9:30 am with his wife and son. After screening, their passports were taken away. He stated that those with symptoms were sent for quarantine immediately but the others were made to wait for over eight hours. “We were told to sit on the ground and we could not go anywhere. My son was hungry and I asked them if I could go and purchase food but they told us to go back and sit down,” he stated.Many others took to Twitter, posting photographs of the quarantine facilities they had been taken to. One person tweeting as @tinkerbell9957 said her daughter, who had arrived from Spain around 8:30 am, was made to wait for several hours without food or water, before being put on a bus and taken to a facility in Narela.“…And was told - nalke se paani peelo. Seems like the authorities have left my daughter there to die . She is having a nervous breakdown crying - mom plz get me out of here. Why is my daughter being subjected to all this. Is she a criminal Help (sic)” she tweeted.Another user, Prerna Jain, tweeted: “My sister returned from Germany today and has been taken to the same isolation centre in Narela. There is no water, food or electricity there, even her test has not been done yet. We are worried for her safety.

214,['17/03/2020'],Popular South Goa beaches staring at fewer tourists,"Only a handful of tourists were seen at Colva beach on Monday

COLVA: South Goa’s popular Colva beach wears a deserted look these days due to a stark absence of tourists. At any point of time this beach attracts thousands domestic tourists as well as foreigners , but on Monday morning one could count the number of tourists on the beach; fivc in the waters while a few more on the shore.

On most days this beach starts getting crowded as early as 8.30am. However, given the current situation with the outbreak of corona virus, some domestic tourists are not even bothering to check into hotels but are seen with their bags and backpacks on the shore or in the waters or taking selfies.

Miransha Naik, owner of Blue Corner shack and beach huts at Benaulim beach, says the business losses are above of 90% since the beginning of March. “Majority of my guests are foreigners, all have cancelled their bookings and it is a huge blow.”

Another shack owner, Roger Fernandes, said it is disaster this season, beginning with permissions which were granted as late as December instead of October last year, and now with almost two and half months remaining for Goa’s holiday season, shack owners have no guests. “After shacks actually started operating for the season, there was news of the collapse of charter companies, Thomas Cook and Cox & Kings which added to our woes. There was almost a 30% drop in tourists and that too at the peak of the season,” Fernandes said, adding that in the afternoons 20-25 tables at his restaurant are occupied, but these days he feels lucky if he has four tables occupied.

215,['17/03/2020'],"After students’ demand and govt order, NU defers over 100 exams","Nagpur: The Nagpur University (NU) on Monday suspended all ongoing summer exams from March 17 to 31 in the wake of intense student demand, and in line with the ministry of higher and technical education’s announcement in the evening. Even practical exams have been postponed.

Many students were apprehensive of appearing in the exams due to rapid spread of coronavirus across the state. Being a large university, each exam centre is assigned hundreds of students at a time by NU.

Acting registrar Neeraj Khaty said around 33 remaining exams from the ongoing first phase of summer exams, and 85 under the second phase have been deferred till further notice. “The new dates will be announced after a review on March 26 and 27,” Khaty said.

Khaty also said that all evaluation of answerbooks, paper setting and moderation works too has been suspended. These works require gathering of professors at the exam section where space is a problem.

Director of Examinations and Evaluation Prafulla Sabale said total 133 exams were scheduled under the first phase since February 27. “Of these, 100 were over. March 19 onwards, the 2nd phase with 85 examinations (mostly for failure students) of BSc, BA, MA, LLM, LLB, BCom etc was set to start. These will have over a lakh students,” he said.

Sabale said from April 3 the third phase is planned for regular students of BSc, BE, and BA. “As per the plan, examinations were to end by June 25. In the 3rd phase, 2.20 lakh students are supposed to appear in 283 exam,” he said.

The NU would be holding 899 exams this summer.

Khaty said in the new schedule, to be decided after March 31, exams may have to be conducted on Sundays too.

This year, over 4.40 lakh students have filled up forms for the summer exams. Of these, 1.12 lakh are from first-year of different courses, 1.72 lakh second-year, 1.40 lakh third-year, besides 35,000 students of BE and BArch and 22,000 from all PG courses.

Earlier in the day, several students from the city had written to the governor and higher education department expressing concern beside calling up vice chancellor SP Kane. The VC had expressed inability to cancel exams as there was no directive regarding university exams from the government, even as it ordered complete closure of all educational institutions to prevent spread of Covid-19.

“We request you to kindly defer our upcoming university exams slated to start from March 19 to a future date that may be safer for student community taking into mind the dangers of Covid-19,” one of the letters reads.

“On behalf of the entire student fraternity, I thank the university and the government for timely action with regard to rescheduling of the examinations to prevent further spread of Covid-19,” said advocate Faisal Ameen, a LLM student.

According to sources, nearly 40% of the state leadership may undergo a change.“The party is driven by the principle of reaching out to the underprivileged. Both the Centre and UP government have been devising policies and schemes for the benefit of people. We will rely heavily on the benefits provided to people,” UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said. BJP also plans to contest panchayat elections which are a reflection of political situation at ground level, essentially in rural areas. The party made a head start last week by forming a committee of senior leaders to supervise panchayat elections due later this year. Sources said the party would identify block level workers and assign responsibilities to them.The party will also identify blocks where its organisational machinery is relatively weak and needs refurbishment. The move comes amid the state unit of BJP raising the percentage of OBC, Dalit and women cadre from 7% to 42% in district committees.According to political experts, equations might have changed after the amended citizenship law with the Opposition seeking to raise BJP’s heckles by portraying it anti-Muslim and anti-Dalit.“Instructions have been issued to workers at grass roots level to reach out OBCs and Dalits and assure them that the citizenship law would not affect them,” a senior BJP leader said.The party’s minority wing is also trying to allay apprehensions among minorities.BJP is also considering bye-elections to Bangarmau, Bulandshahr, Tundla and Suar assembly seats as another testing ground to assess political situation.Experts said the BJP’s decision to field its candidates for the first time in teachers’ constituency legislative council seats was also driven by consideration to consolidate its position among educated masses.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74669214,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-506299,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/leadership-rejig-thrust-at-block-level-on-anvil/articleshow/74664041.cms
217,['17/03/2020'],Raut apologizes for remarks against Brahmins,"Nagpur: Energy minister Nitin Raut has apologized for his remarks against Brahmins made at his felicitation function at Indora ground recently.

BJP had got Raut in a tight spot on Sunday by lodging a police complaint against him. Later at a press conference, BJP leaders Milind Mane, Sandip Jadhav and Dharmapal Meshram pointed out that former Congress prime ministers Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were Brahmins. Even his former party president Rahul Gandhi is a Brahmin, they said.

In a WhatsApp message posted by Raut in his media group and in an SMS sent to TOI, the minister said that Congress did not oppose Brahmins but Brahminical ideology that believed in caste system and Manusmriti.

“Many Brahmins of Congress have led the country and are still leading it. Many Brahmin leaders were on the forefront of propagating progressive ideology and Congress is proud of them. My remarks were meant for the manuwadi Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Brahmin community should not misunderstand these remarks. I apologize for the incident,” he said.

The apology notwithstanding, Raut had targeted Brahmins and not RSS at Indora ground while opposing the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), say political observers.

218,['17/03/2020'],"288 trees axed in Mafsu; inside job, say activists","Nagpur: The lush green pockets owned by government agencies in the city continue to get destroyed due to poor protection. In a fresh case, 288 trees that once stood tall on land owned by the Maharashtra Animal and Fishery Sciences University (Mafsu) in Bharat Nagar have been mysteriously chopped off. Greens suspect the involvement of the university in the illegal tree felling. Varsity officials have denied the allegations.

Interestingly, the land is adjacent to Bharat Van where the mysterious disappearance of thousands of trees in the last few years had recently came to fore. Bharat Van is owned by Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth.

On Monday morning, residents of Bharat Nagar spotted a bunch of labourers cutting trees inside the Mafsu land. “They came in a tempo and were using a machine to cut the trees. We saw them cutting branches as well as entire trees. When we enquired if they had any work order for tree felling, they refused to share any details,” said resident Sachin Kale.

While the residents were making calls to environment activists and Mafsu officials to stop the work, the labourers fled.

A team from Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s garden department soon reached the spot. On inspection, they found that around 200 trees were recently felled without the department’s mandatory permission. “As per the prima facie evidence, it looks like the illegal tree felling has taken place in the last ten days or so. Most of the felled trees are of babul which has good commercial value as it is extensively used in making furniture,” officials said, who also conducted a spot panchanma.

Mafsu officials present on the spot denied any involvement in the tree felling. “We usually tell our staff to trim branches felling on road. However, we never knew so many trees were cut deep inside the land. This is the work of outsiders,” they said.

University registrar Chandrabhan Parate told TOI: “We are not aware of any such activity happening in our premises. We didn’t issue work order for felling trees and we will enquire into the matter.”

Environment activists and residents however stated that it was impossible that the officials were not aware of the happenings. “As per the security guards, a truck comes regularly to take away the felled timber. The machine which is used to cut the trees makes a loud noise. How is it possible that the officials didn’t know about the felling?” questioned green activist Amit Heda.

Activists also suspect a nexus between Mafsu officials and tree contractors. “This felling didn’t happen in a day. If professional tree-cutters are regularly cutting trees on the varsity land, it is obvious that they are working hand-in-gloves with the officials,” they said.

When the activists checked the cell phone of a varsity official, it was seen that all call lists were deleted. “There is certainly a big racket going on,” they said.

220,['17/03/2020'],"T passes resolution against contentious CAA, NPR &amp; NRC","Hyderabad: Telangana on Monday passed a resolution in the state assembly against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 ( CAA ), National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The resolution said that there was a concerted effort to tinker with the inclusive nature of Indian citizenship through this exercise, which the state government was opposing.

The resolution, introduced by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) in the Telangana assembly, urged the central government to amend CAA by removing all references to religion or foreign country. “Abrogate CAA,” KCR said in the house.

Although the resolution does not explicitly say that NPR work will be stopped, sources in the government told TOI that the state government would not implement it in its present format. “Work on NPR was to start on April 1. If the Centre gives us a revised format by removing questions on place and date of birth of parents, we can still complete it within the September 30 deadline,” said a source.

KCR told the assembly that his government feared NPR and NRC may result in exclusion of a large number of people from citizenship. “We are opposing CAA, NPR and NRC after fully understanding their implications,” he said.

KCR further said: “Narrow-minded politics is dividing the country. The secular and tolerant image of India is at stake. The future of the country is at stake.”

The resolution was supported by all TRS, Congress, AIMIM members and opposed by lone BJP MLA T Raja Singh.

Congress floor leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka said the Telangana government should now issue a government order for removal contentious questions from NPR. “Either write to the Centre to remove these questions or pass an order in the state to remove these questions from the NPR exercise,” Bhatti said.

AIMIM floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi thanked KCR for passing the resolution. He too urged the state government to pass an order stopping all data collection activity as part of NPR besides approaching Supreme Court against CAA.

“Muslims being left out of CAA is a grave mistake and also goes against the Constitution,” KCR told the house. He pointed out that Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) in its report for 2018-19 stated that NPR was the first step to NRC but Union home minister Amit Shah claimed that NPR and NRC were not linked. “Who is speaking the truth? No one trusts the Centre. Our doubts must be cleared,” KCR said.

The chief minister also voiced concern over the growing trend of “dubbing anyone a Pakistani agent and traitor” for raising voice against CAA, NPR and NRC.

“Can you call Telangana assembly a traitor for passing this resolution?” he asked. “Some of the MPs and ministers went to the extent of raising slogans such as ‘goli maro’. What kind of language is this? A civilised society like India can’t tolerate this nuisance.”

He wondered how an elected government could say that voter identity cards will not be accepted as proof of citizenship. “They say driving license will not work, Aadhaar will not work, ration card will not work and even passport will not work. Then what will work?” he asked.

KCR also said that the Centre should have called all parties and experts to discuss issues related to national security and moved forward after evolving consensus. He recalled that an earlier experiment to issue national identity cards had failed and the then government had admitted that the pilot project to issue multi-purpose cards failed as the process was found to be cumbersome.

Addressing a press meet with CN Saravana and Anusha Deekshitulu, the party’s candidates for ward numbers 10 and 32 in Tirupati, Kanna alleged that they were obstructed from filing their nomination papers by the police and ruling party activists.

K Viswanadha Reddy, a senior BJP functionary from Vedurukuppam mandal, said he was detained for several hours by the police for suppressing details of his party’s candidates, while K Chengaiah, a retired sub-inspector contesting from a ward reserved for ST in Sullurpet town, alleged he had to suffer humiliation from cops.

“This is the state of affairs in the state. The ruling party wants to win the polls by hook or by crook,” Kanna said, while charging the police of unleashing a reign of terror at the behest of the ruling party. He further claimed that the returning officers went to the extent of ‘forging’ signatures of candidates in the withdrawal forms. He also took a dig at chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy for suggesting people to take paracetamol to control Covid-19 virus. “It’s unfortunate that the state is being governed by such leaders,” Kanna said.

G Bhanuprakash Reddy, general secretary of BJP’s AP unit, wondered why the government was more concerned about holding of elections rather than ensuring public health. “Political heads swear on the Constitution to stand by the people, but in this case they appear to be more inclined towards bagging the seats,” he said.

Jana Sena’s state coordinator P Hariprasad and Tirupati constituency in-charge P Kiran Rayal also demanded the election commission to start the nomination process afresh. The party also demanded installation of CCTV cameras inside the chambers of returning officers and enable online filing of nominations.

Delhi has many corporate hospitals that are frequented by foreigners.Officials said some of them may have arrived before the imposition of visa restrictions and they have to be traced and screened to ensure that the foreign nationals aren’t carriers of the novel coronavirus.Covid-19 has affected as many as 162 countries till date. China, Italy, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Spain are among the worst affected nations.India has, so far, reported only 114 cases of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and two individuals have succumbed to it.This is because that disease has been limited to persons with travel history to the affected countries and those who came in contact with the infected individuals. There is currently no community transmission of Covid-19, according to the government.However, experts agree, the risk of such an eventuality where Covid-19 breaks out in communities affecting larger number of people cannot be ruled out. “Tracing the high risk individuals and quarantining them until they recover is the only way to contain the disease spread. We need to focus on tracing each and every individual, Indian or foreigner, who has travel history to countries affected by Covid-19,” said a health official.As of Monday, Delhi had reported seven Covid-19 cases and one death. State health officials said at least two out of the seven patients have been discharged from the hospital.Last week, Delhi government declared Covid-19 an epidemic and issued Delhi Epidemic Disease Covid-19 Regulations 2020 to contain the spread of novel coronavirus in the capital.

LUCKNOW: Undeterred by coronavirus threat, the BJP brass has decided to fan out across the state to drum up people’s support by holding ‘chaupal’ in nearly 58,000 villages from March 19-24 to mark the completion of three years of the Yogi Adityanath government in UP.

During the campaign titled ‘Sushasan Ke Teen Varsh’ (three years of good governance), UP ministers, MLAs, MPs and senior party functionaries will hold meetings with people in rural areas and recount achievements of their government.

Talking to TOI, UP BJP general secretary Govind Narain Shukla said, “The idea is to ensure that people-centric steps taken by the Centre and the state government reach the grassroots level.”

He said the party cadre and senior leaders had been asked to take adequate precautions during the campaign in view of coronavirus.

A senior official at the chief minister’s office said the CM’s programme could be altered considering the severity of coronavirus threat.

BJP also plans to hold a special campaign wherein party functionaries would meet parents and students to take feedback on educational system and how it can be improved further.

The move is seen as an attempt by the party to use the occasion to reach out to maximum number of people and lay groundwork for the 2022 assembly election.

According to BJP leaders, every party functionary will be made in charge of at least five villages where they will hold ‘chaupal’ and collect people’s feedback. MLAs and MPs may be asked to reach out to more than five villages.

The party is also planning to revive its Gram Swaraj Abhiyan under which ministers and senior party members camp in villages.

225,['17/03/2020'],"Covid-19 in Delhi: Three corporations invoke emergency clause, insist on hand wash points","NEW DELHI: For residents’ welfare associations, market bodies, restaurants, banquet hall, hotels, guesthouses and mall managements, it is now mandatory to have a sanitation facilities at various points where hands can be properly washed with soap and water and spritzed with hand sanitisers. On Monday, the three municipal corporations issued these instructions under the rarely invoked Section 376 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, which empowers the municipal commissioners to issue directions to be observed by public or a particular section to prevent outbreak of a disease.The requirements will remain applicable, for now, till March 31. The managements of restaurants, banquet halls, hotels, guesthouses and mall have also been instructed to ensure no crowding at any particular site on their premises. “Any persons who commits the breach of these directions will be deemed to have committed an offence under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code dealing with disobedience of an order duly promulgated by a public servant and will be prosecuted in court,” a municipal official asserted. “Violators are liable to be punished with a fine and imprisonment up to six months.”The order specifies locations where sanitation points need to be installed. RWAs and commercial establishments have been told to have these at entry points, while market association will should do so at multiple points, including entry points and existing piaos (water dispensers).“Checks on compliance will begin from Tuesday. The goal is to control the spread of the novel coronavirus before it overwhelms the health system,” said a health official. “The last time Section 376 was resorted to was during the dengue epidemic of 1997 when people were warned that mosquito breeding conditions on their premises was punishable.”While North Delhi Municipal Corporation commissioner Varsha Joshi said the facility should offer either soap and water or sanitisers, a health official said the former was preferable.Not all RWAs are happy with the order. Chetan Sharma, head of Confederation of NCR RWAs, said that its members were voluntary organisations with no funds for such requirements. “The municipals should provide us resources to set up sanitary points,” he said. B S Vohra of the East Delhi RWA Joint Front pointed out that this order could be suitable for group housing societies, not plotted colonies. “EDMC and Delhi government should provide the RWAs with sanitisers and masks,” Vohra added.Rajeev Kakria of Greater Kailash I RWA felt that instead of ordering the RWAs, the corporation commissioner should have requested the residents’ associations to help gap the shortcomings and functioning of the civic bodies. “RWAs do not have half the funds that civic bodies squander on endless meetings,” he snapped. “The government doesn’t want to empower RWAs through some statutory laws but turns to them for everything.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74669216,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-204036,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-corporations-invoke-emergency-clause-insist-on-hand-wash-points/articleshow/74663794.cms
226,['17/03/2020'],Make SCoR operational: Vijayasai,"Vijayawada: Rajya Sabha MP and YSR Congress national general secretary V Vijayasai Reddy , through a Zero Hour motion in Rajya Sabha on Monday, requested Union railway minister Piyush Goyal to expedite the process of setting up and making operational the South Coast Railway ( SCoR ) zone.

The MP said that the proposal to set up the new zone will boost connectivity and enable faster freight transport in the state.

“The announcement pertaining to a separate railway zone was made in February 2019 under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014. But unfortunately, even one year after the announcement of the new zone, the SCoR is yet to commence its operations. The new zone has the potential of becoming India’s most profitable zone with an estimated annual earnings of about Rs 13,000 crore. This would serve the major ports in Andhra Pradesh, besides giving a much needed boost to the commerce and industry within the state and help the Railways earn good revenue. I therefore request the railway ministry to make it operational soon,” said Reddy.

Reddy also said the Andhra Pradesh government is chalking out plans to develop Visakhapatnam city as the proposed executive capital of the state. The MP said the government is focusing particularly on high quality, adequate public transport.

Reddy said that the government is planning to take up development work in clusters. Various facilities will be available in each cluster.

People need education institutions, proper roads and medical facilities, besides parks and play fields, Reddy said, adding, “If we could provide these in sufficient number in the clusters people should not fear traffic congestion or any other problem.”

HYDERABAD: One person was killed after a portion of a building being demolished sans permission illegally at night collapsed on Rajiv Rahadari at Karkhana in Secunderabad around 11.45pm on Sunday. The demolition had been going on for over a month and had it crashed during day on the busy stretch many would have been crushed as there’s even a bus stop right in front of the building.

The victim is yet to be identified but cops suspect he was one of the workers hired for demolition. A car was also damaged when iron beams fell on it, but the driver escaped unhurt.

Officials said the owner was bulldozing the structure without any protective covering resulting in huge chunks of concrete falling on the road.

Police said the four-storied building was owned by Durga Prasad, a realtor, who had flouted the Cantonment Act that requires one to take permission from the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) before demolishing a property. SCB authorities said Prasad had rented it to M/s Satyam Computer Services (firm of former CEO Byrraju Ramalinga Raju ) five years ago, and after the company vacated it, a private bank used for some months before vacating it. The building has been vacant for the past five years.

“The owner of the building gave the work to a private contractor for demolishing the building and raising a new structure,” said Karkhana inspector P Madhukar Swamy. Police have registered a case under IPC Section 304-II (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) against Prasad, contractor Rajeshwar Reddy and a supervisor.

Apart from SCB, the GHMC’s directorate of enforcement, vigilance and disaster management rushed to the spot to clear the debris blocking the road.

229,['17/03/2020'],LMC mulls filing FIRs against tax defaulters,"Lucknow: Not paying your house tax on time can land you in jail.

For the next financial year, Lucknow Municipal Corporation has mooted a proposal to lodge an FIR against house tax defaulters. The proposal will be tabled in the House meeting for final approval.

“First, a notice will be served to a defaulter. If they do not respond within 15 days, an FIR will be lodged,” said additional municipal commissioner Amit Singh.

The civic body had recently increased its house tax revenue target from Rs 300 crore to Rs 410 crore to meet the rise in expenditure resulting from a hike in corporators’ funds from Rs 95 lakh to Rs 1.28 crore each.

However, LMC ’s experience has shown that it has not been able to meet house tax collection target over the past three years. In 2018, a similar increase in corporators’ funds had to be rolled back because of failure to meet revenue target.

However, this time, LMC officials said that they have prepared an action plan to achieve targets.

First, a geographical index system (GIS) survey will be conducted to cover all 5.48 lakh households in the city to identify those paying undervalued tax.

Thereafter, a drive to collect taxes from defaulters will be carried out. Simultaneously, staff of the civic body will conduct door-to-door drive to collect taxes.

230,['17/03/2020'],"7,000 motorists paid for parking in 10 days","Nashik: Around 7 ,000 people have used the pay-and-park facilities of Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) in the past 10 days.

NMSCDCL made the pay-and-park facilities operational at 15 parking lots from March 4. Around 5,000 people parked their four-wheelers and 2,172 parked their two-wheelers in the spaces.

More spaces for pay-and-parking projects are being added.

Trigyn Technologies Pvt Ltd, a Mumbai-based private company, had won the bid to set up 33 smart parking spaces, 28 on-street and 5 off-street, across the city.

The pay and park system has been started at 15 locations on an experimental basis. The system will start for the remaining locations later.

NMSCDCL officials said that they have received good response to pay and park spaces from citizens in the first 10 days of commercial operations.

A special application — Nashik Smart Parking — has been developed to help motorists check the status of parking spaces and availability of slots. Residents can pre-book the parking slots through the mobile app, which can be downloaded from the Google Play store.

Earlier, the charges for parking were Rs 30 per hour for a four-wheeler and Rs 15 per hour for a two-wheeler. But after the demand from the public, the parking charges have decreased. Now the parking charges for four-wheelers would be Rs 10 per hour and Rs 5 for two-wheelers.

Initially, the NMSCDCL had started smart parking spaces on a trial basis and free of cost at these 15 locations from July 1 last year. The smart city company had plans to charge fees for parking spaces from July 15, but it continued to provide parking spaces free of cost. The decision to start pay and parking had been deferred two to three times.

The NMSCDCL started pay and park facilities at these 15 locations from March 4.

231,['17/03/2020'],"Pune: Two-wheeler &amp; car sales decline, but tax collections remain stable","PUNE: Automobile sales are yet to rebound to the 2018 levels, but the tax collection per vehicle at the Regional Transport office (RTO) has since increased for two-wheelers and remained stable for four-wheelers.RTO officials and auto dealers said the tax collection figures were a reflection of the increased prices of vehicles under the new Bharat Stage-VI emission standard regime.“There’s an increase in prices and the extent depends on the category of the vehicles,” a senior RTO official here said.In a year when automakers sold less and tax collections were stable, consumers were at the receiving end because of the increased prices.Automobile dealers said the increase in two-wheeler prices was in the range of Rs 8,000-20,000 per vehicle, and between Rs 60,000 and Rs 1 lakh per four wheeler.Though a few auto dealers in the city are trying to exhaust their BS-IV-make stocks, they are aware that the price increase is making it that much harder to sell in a sluggish market.Save for the festive months of October to December 2019, the sales have continued to report a downward trend.The RTO collects a tax of 10-12% for two-wheelers on the vehicle price and 7-15% on four-wheelers, depending on the fuel type. The officials said the stable four-wheeler tax collections at RTO in the later half of the current fiscal were also an indication of people moving towards petrol and CNG options.“Barely 20% of the new vehicles getting registered are diesel versions (where tax is also the highest). This can possibly be due to the reduced price gap between petrol and diesel variants,” an RTO official said, adding, “The tax collections could have been higher because of the increased prices.”Companies started to introduce the variant compliant with the Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) emissions standard in November 2019, with two-wheeler manufacturers making the first move. Few four-wheeler makers started to introduce their BS-VI versions in December, but bulk of them introduced their variants in February 2020.Proposed emission limits in BS VI are in line with Euro 5 mass emission guidelines which became applicable from January 1 in Europe.The RTO last week said it would not register even a single BS-IV or lower emission grade new vehicle after March 31, 2020 and told people to get their vehicles registered before the deadline.“It was a bad year for auto sales in this fiscal. The migration is also not helping in increasing the sales.The rate increase has been steep and the companies, to an extent, might be able to absorb the fall in sales due to the increase in prices.

Meanwhile, officials are planning to add 100 more beds in the isolated wards of various hospitals in addition to the existing 90 beds.Speaking to TOI, Krishna district health and medical officer, T Srirama Murthy said the medical tests of all the five personnel, who were admitted to isolated wards with suspected coronavirus symptoms, have tested negative. “Even though the district has not registered a single positive case, we are planning to set up quarantine facilities to enhance preparedness and for containment of the virus. The number of beds in the isolated wards will also be increased to accommodate more suspected cases in case of emergency. Several measures have been initiated to strengthen the community surveillance, such as conducting a household survey through the village/ward volunteers to identify suspected cases and create awareness among the public,” said Srirama Murthy.Srirama Murthy requested persons arriving from foreign countries to self-isolate for 14 days. “I request the public to avoid mass gatherings and refrain from non-essential travel, particularly the epidemic-hit areas, as of now. We have also been conducting social awareness programmes on ways to prevent the virus. We have put up hoardings and distributed pamphlets. Foreign returnees are specially being screened at the airport and they are kept under 14-day observation. Doctors and other medical personnel have been specially trained on the treatment protocols of coronavirus. Observing good personal hygiene, washing hands frequently, avoiding close contact with infected persons and social distancing will go a long way in preventing the spread of the virus” said Srirama Murthy.Recently, the state government invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 to enhance its preparedness and curb the spread of coronavirus.

A group of people who were provided accommodation at police training college in southwest Delhi’s Dwarka wrote to the area SDM complaining about unhygienic conditions.CM Arvind Kejriwal acknowledged that there could be some problems at such facilities. “People flying in from abroad mostly belong to the affluent class.

So, we have made arrangements for them in certain hotels,” he added.“We have sufficient beds if cases increase and hospitalisation is needed,” he added.Those availing the hotel facility would get three meals - breakfast, lunch and dinner - two bottles of mineral water per day, tea and coffee and other facilities such as Wi-Fi and TV.

NASHIK: The first lot of 60 new CNG buses arrived in Nashik on Monday. The passing and fitness tests of 25 buses were conducted by the Nashik regional transport office (RTO) on Monday. The remaining will be tested on Tuesday.

Mayor Satish Kulkarni said that the CNG buses have come directly from the manufacturing plant in Rajasthan.

The Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) has decided to start the city bus service from May 1. It has plans to operate 400 buses through three private agencies. This includes 200 CNG buses, 50 diesel and 150 electric buses.

“As these are the BS IV version of CNG buses, we have to conduct RTO registrations and fitness tests before March 31,” said RTO officials.

The NMC has already signed agreements with two private agencies to operate 200 CNG and 50 diesel buses. It is, however, yet to sign an agreement with the third private agency to operate 150 electric buses. While a Pune-based agency will operate 150 buses (120 CNG and 30 diesel), a Delhi-based agency will operate 100 buses (80 CNG and 20 diesel). Both the agencies have brought the first lot of 60 buses for certification. The remaining 190 buses would be brought to the city by March 25.

The buses have been purchased by the bus operators, who will also provide the drivers. The NMC will pay charges on a per-kilometre basis. The civic body will also employ an agency to collect fares.

Meanwhile, Ajay Boraste, the leader of opposition from Shiv Sena , opposed the project. “We are not against the public transport, but are against the NMC running the service. NMC’s financial condition is not good and bus service will add to the losses,” he said. He added that he had written to municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game, seeking answers to various queries. “We will launch an agitation if we do not receive a reply in a day or two.

236,['17/03/2020'],Madras HC refuses to regularize 4 illegal MBBS admissions,"Representative image

PUDUCHERRY: The Madras high court has directed the Medical Council of India (MCI) to initiate action against a private medical college — Venkateshwaraa Medical College Hospital and Research Centre (SVMCH) — in Puducherry for illegally admitting four students into MBBS course against the council's regulations and the Supreme Court's orders.

Justice N Anand Venkatesh also directed the college to refund the fees paid by the four students and to pay a compensation of Rs 1 lakh each to them for having caused mental agony and hardship.

The justice requested the MCI, the Puducherry government and Centralized Admission Committee (Centac) to check whether the four students could be accommodated in any other institution based on their merit in the coming academic year.

Justice Anand Vekatesh was passing the order while dismissing a petition by SVMCH seeking a direction to the MCI and others to approve the admission of four students -- V Bollini Damu, M R S Mahesh, P Sabari Ganesh and M Shri Preethi -- into MBBS course during the academic year 2018-19.

The MCI and others, however, strongly objected to the plea saying the private college ought not to have filled four MBBS seats that had fallen vacant after the first, second and mop-up counselling and hence their admission is 'illegal'. They said Centac alone can hold counselling and recommend the candidates for admission into government or private medical colleges. They said no authority or institution can admit any candidate to MBBS course against the MCI's regulations and the Supreme Court's order.

Puducherry government’s counsel accused the college of repeatedly violating the MCI's regulations and the apex court order, and pointed out that the college had admitted 38 candidates into MBBS course for the academic year 2017-18 on its own and the MCI discharged (removed) the 38 candidates, who had been admitted illegally. He further said the college admitted five students in the current academic year on its own against the stray vacancies after mop-up counselling ignoring the merit list in the ratio of 1:10 furnished by the Centac.

The judge cited the SC order that declared that only the state government or the authority designated by it can hold common counselling for admission in government and private medical colleges including those run by religious and linguistic minorities.

""Any candidate admitted in contravention/violation (MCI's regulations and SC order) shall be discharged (removed) by the council forthwith,"" the justice said while quoting the Clause 5 (7) of the MCI's regulation.

He also observed that the college has been using the students as a shield to get over their illegal action and refused to exercise its jurisdiction to sanctify an illegal act.

The daily ridership has gone down by almost 3 lakh and the revenue has reduced by around Rs50 lakh.According to authorities, daily ridership has come down to 9 lakh from the previous 12 lakh and the revenue has slumped to Rs1 crore, which used to be over Rs1.5 crore. Authorities said they were not expecting a revival unless the restrictions on the educational institutes were lifted.“School children, staff and college students comprise a majority of PMPML users. There has been a drop in footfall at bus stands. Even bus trips to the market places have been witnessing lesser crowd,” an official from the PMPML said.The PMPML’s ‘bus day’ initiative was also affected last week, in the wake of the novel coronavirus spread. As per the initiative, the transport utility had introduced maximum number of buses on road on a single day. The PMPML had expected to mop up Rs2 crore, but was able to generate Rs1.8 crore, an official said.Meanwhile, the transport utility said that despite a considerable drop in ridership it has not cancelled trips so far. “There is also a flip side to it.

Another 36-year-old woman with symptoms was admitted to the isolation ward and her swab sample was sent to NIV in Pune on Monday. There have been no fresh confirmed coronavirus cases in the region yet.

Even the 59-year-old patient, who had tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday, has had no history of fever in the past 24 hours, the medical administrator of the private hospital where she is undergoing treatment said. The patient is stable and does not currently need ventilator support, the doctor added.

The patient, who had travelled to Russia and Kazakhstan, had returned to Delhi on March 3. She had then travelled to Aurangabad via Mumbai. Subsequently, the woman had delivered a lecture at a city-based college. According to Nita Padalkar, the municipal officer of health in the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, all her students have been screened and none of them has shown any symptoms. They have all been home-quarantined.

“We have also examined and conducted the primary enquiry of 32 persons, including the confirmed patient’s family members and those she came in contact with over the past few days. No one is having any symptoms, but they are quarantined,” Padalkar said.

TRICHY: In a significant development to utilise the integrated vegetable and fruits market complex at Kallikudi , the agricultural marketing and business department has allotted 207 shops in the market to farmers producers organisations (FPOs). After receiving applications from a few FPOs across the state, the department has invited them to use the complex for stocking and value addition.

As the facility was idle for over three years, the state government recently tweaked the rules to put the market to use for accommodating FPOs and SHGs, following which 207 shops were allotted for FPOs across the state. “Already, few FPOs selling banana and guava products from Trichy and Dindigul have approached us seeking shops. Further, we have invited FPOs across the state to rent the shops,” an official source said.

The integrated vegetable market was constructed at a cost of Rs 77 crore, including financial support from Nabard, to relocate wholesale traders from Gandhi market in the city. However, wholesale traders have been refusing to occupy the 830 shops in the market citing proximity and limited space.

Since Trichy is the geographical centre of the state, officials said that the shops in Kallikudi market can be used as a transit stockyard to export vegetable and fruit products through Trichy International Airport. The agricultural marketing department has also issued notices to 288 wholesale traders who have rented shops in the market.

The wholesale traders who paid a fee for occupying the shops have been told to accommodate the facility or annul the agreement. “Some of the wholesale traders who were allotted shops in Kallikudi market are interested to renew the agreement ,” an official added.

PUNE: The Chinchwad police on Sunday arrested a 22-year-old on the charge of robbing a man of his gold chain and cash, collectively valued at Rs26,000.

The robbery occurred late on Friday night in Chinchwad. Police have identified the suspect as Aniket Kamble of Bhosari and have launched a search for his three accomplices.

“A probe revealed that a case of sexual harassment was recently registered against Kamble. He had been absconding since then,” assistant inspector of Chinchwad police Abhijit Jadhav told TOI.

The officer said the incident occurred when the complainant, Sanjay Raut (29) of Nigdi , was on his way home on Friday night. “When Raut reached Chinchwad around 11.30pm, he stopped along the road for answering nature’s call. Kamble and his three accomplices noticed Raut while passing from there. Kamble got down from his two-wheeler and threatened Raut with a sharp weapon,” Jadhav said.

The officer said Kamble and the three others forced Raut to follow them to a nearby secluded spot. “They assaulted him and robbed his Rs1,600 and a gold chain before fleeing the spot. After receiving the complaint, our team swung into action. We got the information about Kamble and took him into custody,” Jadhav said.

“We have ascertained the identity of the three accomplices. We will arrest them soon,” the officer added.

Pune: The city crime branch on Sunday night arrested Katraj resident Mandar Waykar (40) in connection with the Rs50 lakh extortion case, which also involves gangster Chhota Rajan ’s niece Priyadarshini Nikalje and one other man.

On March 13, the police had arrested Dheeraj Sabale and booked Nikalje and Waykar before launching a search. The following day, a magisterial court in Pune Cantonment had ordered Sabale’s remand in police custody till March 16.

Anti-extortion team’s sub-inspectors Sanjay Gaikwad and Nilesh Mahadik and a team arrested Waykar in Katraj. The search is on for Nikalje, who is a resident of Wanowrie area.

On Monday, police produced Sabale and Waykar before judicial magistrate first class A D Deshpande, who ordered their remand in police custody till March 18. “For recovery of weapon (used in crime) and detailed investigation, accused are remanded in police custody,” the magistrate stated in his order.

Public prosecutor Angela Navgire, arguing for the duo’s custodial remand, submitted that the police wanted to trace Nikalje by interrogating them as they were familiar with her movement, and also wanted to establish if Chhota Rajan had any direct or indirect link with the offence. The firearm used in the crime was yet to be recovered and police wanted to establish the ownership of the firearm, besides ascertaining the involvement of the suspects in similar offences. Lawyer Milind Pawar, representing the complainant, assisted the prosecutor in the matter.

Sabale, Waykar and Nikalje are facing charges of threatening a 48-year-old Katraj-based developer at gunpoint and demanding Rs50 lakh from him, between March 8 and 13. The developer was involved in a row with his wife and her sister, who approached Nikalje with a plea to intervene. Nikalje then wrote a complaint application to the Bharati Vidyapeeth police station, using her letterhead, and urged police to file a complaint against the man for harassing the two women, police said.

The chief secretary urged the SEC to adhere to the election schedule announced earlier citing that situation related to coronavirus was under control in the state and it would continue to be under control for another three to four weeks.

The SEC on Sunday had issued a notification deferring local body elections by six weeks in view of the Covid- -19 scare.

Sawhney said the government has been taking all the precautionary measures to contain Covid-19. She mentioned that as on date there is only one confirmed positive case and that too of a person who has returned from Italy. This is an indication that at present, local transmission has not set in and that the spread of coronavirus in the state is under control and there may be no threat of the outbreak in alarming in the next three to four weeks, the CS pointed out.

The CS mentioned that, however, looking at the trend in other countries, in spite of all efforts, nothing can be predicted of the situation after four weeks from now. Thus, any postponement of elections will make the conduct of elections very uncertain, depriving the state of the availability of the third-tier of government, which is critical at this juncture, she added.

The CS said that the state government would like to assure that it has been taking all measures and will continue the steps to contain Covid-19. Moreover, the CS stated that public health was the responsibility of the government, and therefore the SEC could have held consultation with the state government. This would have helped us to appraise the correct status of Covid-19 before coming to a conclusion on the postponement of the local body elections, she added.

Despite the many legal impediments, the SEC with the active cooperation of the state has set the stage for the conduct of local body elections in March 2020. Hence it is requested that the SEC may revoke its order postponing the local body elections and may adhere to the elections schedule announced earlier.

TRICHY: The city corporation has chalked out a plan to construct a three storey community health centre with super speciality consultation at a cost of Rs 15 crore on West Boulevard (WB) road, under the smart cities mission . The facility will serve as a referral centre for 18 urban primary health centres (UPHCs) under corporation limits and provide consultation for patients requiring advanced heart and renal care.

The civic body will demolish the Kodumal Hospital complex adjacent Ibrahim Park on WB road to construct the health centre complex. While the basement is earmarked for car parking, the three floors of the centre will be utilised for consultation and accommodating patients.

The proposed facility will come up on 10,000 square feet and have at least 100 beds capacity with five doctors round the clock. Officials said that the site on WB road has been chosen as the adjoining Tharanallur, Rockfort and Madurai road localities have a significant population of low income group (LIG) families.

The fund for the project has been availed under the smart cities mission but a detailed project report for the proposal is yet to be finalised. The facility is likely to be maintained using National Health Mission fund.

“Dialysis treatment will be available at the proposed health centre. The civil work will be taken up within the next three months and may go on for two years,” a senior official with the civic body said.

Once the centre comes up, instead of referring patients from PHCs to government medical college hospital, PHCs will refer the patients here. As Trichy ’s health infrastructure was rated the best across the nation by the ministry of housing and urban affairs through the ease of living ranking 2018, the civic body said that the multi-floor community health centre was proposed to sustain the coveted tag.

Hence it was decided to close these two monuments temporarily to prevent the spread of the virus,” an ASI official said.The government has imposed the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, giving local authorities the powers to take any measure necessary to arrest the spread of the disease.Ram said that the authorities were closing places where people tend to assemble in large numbers.

TRICHY: The Trichy district administration and public health and preventive medicine department are in the process of converting 75 shops of the Central market for vegetables, fruits and flowers at Kallikudi into hospital wards to accommodate passengers, who have returned from countries with Covid-19 cases.

The market, situated on the Trichy-Madurai four-way lane has remained unused since its inauguration in 2017. It has a total 830 shops, of which 75 are likely to be occupied by the public health and preventive medicine department as part of the preventive measure against Covid-19 in a few days as a makeshift arrangement.

“The idea is to quarantine passengers from countries worst-hit by Covid-19. Even if they are symptom-free, they will be isolated if they are above 60 years of age or anyone with comorbid conditions. They will be quarantined in the shops to be converted as wards for 14 days. It will also help us prevent the spreading of the virus in the community,” deputy director of health services (DDHS) Dr A Subramani told TOI on Monday.

The seven countries that have high numbers of Covid-19 cases include China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany and France. Though special attention will be given to passengers from these seven countries, screening for the remaining countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Sri Lanka will also continue.

Public health department will provide food and accommodation to the passengers. Cots and other necessary equipment will be shifted to the market. Medicines will also be kept ready. Doctors and other health department officials will be posted here to monitor if the passengers show any symptoms of Covid-19.

“Health inspectors and doctors will check the health status of the people. If they are found to be fit during the quarantine period, they will be sent home. In case of any symptoms, they will be rushed to the isolation ward,” said Subramani.

As of now, four passengers with symptoms such as fever and cold are being monitored at the isolation ward of the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) in Trichy.

A health official said that two of them are likely to be discharged on Monday as they were free from symptom after treatment from Friday night.

The SEC is learnt to have discussed election-related issues like chief secretary Nilam Sawhney’s letter and developmental activities in the state while the model code of conduct is in force during his meeting. The governor is understood to have advised the SEC to study the letters of the chief secretary and health secretary, besides continuing the model code of conduct.

The SEC’s decision to postpone the elections has led to a political slugfest in the state, with the ruling YSRC alleging that coronavirus is just an excuse to favour the TDP and one particular community. Even chief minister Jaganmohan Reddy took serious exception to the election body’s order. The TDP, on the other hand, has welcomed the SEC’s decision, alleging that the ruling party has been destroying the sanctity of the constitutional authority of the election commission by attributing motives for its decision taken in the best interests of public health. Former chief minister and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu alleged that the chief minister was trying to blackmail constitutional authorities.

KOLKATA: Roads at peak office hours on Monday resembled a Sunday morning as most stretches remained deserted and buses plied almost empty. With educational institutions being shut, many individuals opting to work from home and people avoiding visits to malls and restaurants—all to ensure coronavirus did not spread—not many people were seen on streets.

In fact, traffic volume was so low in the central business areas, like Dalhousie, Burrabazar and Posta, that cops decided to experiment with the signal timings to ensure vehicle flow on arterial roads was not disturbed. “I have been working at the Jorabagan traffic guard for two years. I have seen jams at the MG Road-Central Avenue crossing reach Ram Mandir, sometimes even Girish Park, on working days. But on Monday, queues of vehicles barely crossed 30m,” said a police officer. He added that Burrabazar and Posta witnessed free flow of vehicles. “Several workers, who had gone home in the neighbouring states for Holi, have not returned yet,” the officer said.

In south, the Park Street-Mullickbazar-Park Circus belt saw half the usual traffic volume, thanks to shut schools. “Maa flyover saw usual volume of vehicles but the Park Circus Seven-Point Crossing was absolutely free of any jam,” said an officer from the Southeast guard.

Higher Secondary examinees, too, said they did not face any jam while reaching centres, not even those commuting on the stretch near BT Road and Tallah Bridge that has been witnessing jams owing to the work on the bridge. “Unlike on other days, there was no traffic snarl at Chiria More. We had to stop only at one traffic signal,” said Soumen Bhadra who travelled from Dunlop to his exam centre at Shyambazar. Bhadra said his family and he were supposed to go on a trip after exams but for now, they had cancelled the plan. “I will stay at home and read books. We don’t want to take any risk,” he said.

Bus operators pointed out that business had been down. “Coronavirus is taking its toll. Business on EM Bypass has been down by 30%, while ticket sales has dipped by 20% at Esplanade , even at peak office time. It is worse during non-peak hours. The scene especially changed since Sunday. if everything shuts down, we need to rethink our strategy, including cutting down on the number of trips,” said Tapan Banerjee, general secretary of Joint Council of Bus Syndicate. He added that since drivers and conductors were constantly on road and in direct contact with a mass of people, they distributed masks and sanitizers among them.

While news of a fresh coronavirus case in Odisha was widely circulated on social media, netizens shared images of desreted streets. “This is not real… I reached Sealdah from Taratala in 20 minutes. Corona has changed travelling,” wrote Asish Das on Facebook, uploading a photograph of Esplanade.

Even regular Metro users said the number of passengers was rather low. “A huge section of Kolkatans is still commuting to office. But there is definitely an effort to self-quarantine,” said Md Akram, a student at MG Road Metro station.

BIJNOR: For over three months, she was gang-raped, coerced and blackmailed. Not necessarily in the same order. Just 12 years old, she had gone to collect fodder for cattle back home when four men from a same family pulled her into a field and gang-raped her for the first time in Dedauli area of Amroha district. One of them filmed the alleged assault to keep it as a “trophy” and use it later.

For the next three months, the girl was repeatedly gang-raped by the four men. They threatened to show the video clip to everyone in the village if she didn’t come out to them. And, all along, the Class V student hid everything from her parents.

But, the girl’s suffering ended on Sunday when her parents-- sensing something amiss-- took her to a local doctor who pronounced her three months pregnant.

The girl, in between the sobs, narrated what she went through in the last three months. The family then approached police and the four accused, 47-year-old Murari, Satendra, Vinod and Sumeri, were booked under IPC sections 376-D (gang-rape), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 503 (criminal intimidation) and under Pocso Act.

Two of them, including the main accused, Murari, have been arrested and sent to jail, police said.

Amroha’s additional superintendent of police (ASP) Ajay Pratap Singh said, “The victim was sent to district hospital for medical examination and her statement was also recorded on Monday. Police have arrested two accused, including Murari, who is over 47 years old. The remaining accused will be nabbed soon.”

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

Jayakwadi dam, biggest among the reservoirs in the region, is 73.33% full as against zero storage during the same period last year.

Manjara dam — which supplies water to Latur, one of the major districts in the region — continues to be in 'zero storage' level as was the case last year, the data revealed.

As per the Irrigation department website, water availability in major dams is 61.64% as against 3.13% on the same day last year, 39.04% in medium dams as against 10.68% last year, and 26.57% in minor reservoirs as against 10.23% last year.

However, water conservation expert Pradeep Purandare said the situation was still grim due to several distribution channels remaining unrepaired. “This high level in dams shows we are not utilizing enough water for irrigation. This high availability may also increase sugarcane cultivation which requires a lot of water,” he said. PTI

272,['17/03/2020'],All new foot-over bridges to have escalators in Chennai,"Representative image

CHENNAI: The foot over-bridges Greater Chennai Corporation will henceforth erect will come equipped with escalators. Even skywalks will have the facility at either end, said senior corporation officials.

This decision was taken after it was found that a majority of the pedestrians refuse to use the foot over-bridges across the city as it involves climbing a number of stairs at either end. Most of them prefer darting across busy roads, or jaywalking, leading to accidents and deaths, senior officials said.

The corporation recently installed a lift at the foot over-bridge on Uttamar Gandhi Salai ( Nungambakkam High Road ) after discovering that it was not being used because one had to climb a number of stairs. The foot over-bridge on Haddows Road is also virtually unused despite continuous traffic on the road as it lacks an escalator.

Senior corporation officials said constructing escalators on either side of foot over-bridges would increase the cost by Rs 1 crore, but it was determined that it would not be a major expense considering the safety aspect. Foot over-bridges with escalators on either side are likely to come up at Harrington Road in Chetpet, Perambur Railway Station , Luz Church Road in Mylapore, LB Road in Adyar-Thiruvanmiyur, Sardar Patel Road, Arcot Road near the Forum Vijaya mall, Anna Nagar Second and Third Avenues and Purasaiwalkam High Road at an estimated Rs 50 crore.

The corporation has decided to install an escalator for the Mambalam skywalk as well for the same reason.

Senior officials said that bridges built on state highways and over railway tracks at stations in Chennai have proven to be ineffective due to the lack of escalators.

For instance, Southern Railway received genuine feedback from senior citizens and the differently abled that they were unwilling to climb the bridges and preferred to cross the railway tracks, despite the risk posed by speeding suburban trains.

In fact, an analysis by Southern Railway for Chennai division, which has a suburban rail network that caters to as many as 1.1 million commuters everyday, shows that 35% of the deaths of passengers on railway tracks happened at stations which had an foot over-bridge.

THANJAVUR: A 63-year-old man was murdered by a five-member gang in a suspected case of murder for gain at Kumbakonam in Thanjavur district on Sunday night.

The victim has been identified as T Ramanathan, an edible oil merchant, and a resident of Melakaveri in Kumbakonam. He was stabbed to death by the gang at his house, while his wife, Vijaya was let off. The couple’s daughter and son-in-law, who were staying with them had gone to attend a wedding when the incident happened.

Preliminary inquiry with Vijaya revealed that two people came to the house and said they had come to invite Ramanathan for an event. She let them inside. When she tried to reduce the television volume, they prevented her from doing so. In the meantime, three more people also gained entry into the house.

All the five members then started attacking Ramanathan with their hands and weapons and threatened to kill his wife if he refused to part with the gold jewellery.

Inspector of police Rameshkumar quoting the woman said the accused took about five sovereigns of gold jewellery from her. After taking the jewellery, they stabbed Ramanathan with a sharp iron rod on his neck killing him on the spot.

Police said they are yet to get a clear picture whether it was a murder for gain. Traders in Kumbakonam downed their shutters on Monday in protest against the murder and demanded their arrest.

The site, over two millennia old, is also home to Buddha’s relic (tooth) and an important site in Buddhist history.

A team of members from Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach)-Visakhapatnam chapter and other heritage enthusiasts from Vizag were at the site as part of a recent visit to other historical locations in Srikakulam district.

“The walls of the old fortification were being dug up. In some places, these walls are almost eight metres wide. Though the Buddhist stupas situated within the fortification were not touched, the walls were being levelled to lay plots,” said P Prasad, Intach member.

K Chitti Babu, former assistant director of the department of archaeology and museums, Visakhapatnam zone, said, “This is one of the most important Buddhist sites. It was here after the Kalinga war that Ashoka was introduced to the tenets of Buddhism. The city was first mentioned in Buddhist Jataka tales (around fourth century BC) and was also the capital of ancient Kalinga, till the capital was shifted to Srimukhalingam by the Eastern Ganga. The entire site including the moat and fortifications are spread over 600 acres. The site was also identified in the 19th century by the founder of Archaeological Survey of India, Sir Alexander Cunningham. Ironically, it is not a protected site.”

S Venkata Rao, assistant director of the department of archaeology and museums, added, “In the late-1990s, the AP archaeology and museums department conducted excavations, after which Buddhist stupas were found. Later, the department had written to the revenue department to hand over the site to the AP archaeology department for protection, but the site, which was under partly under private occupation (chiefly agriculture) and government occupation was never acquired.”

When asked if the department had received any news of the development of housing sites by the government, Venkata Rao said, “Yes we did get information about it and have appealed to the district collector urging him to protect the fort walls. We are yet to get a reply.”

When contacted, the district revenue officer, Srikakulam, Balivada Dayanidhi said, “As far as I know, work on the fort site has stopped.” Locals, however, claim that the sites have been readied and will be handed over by Ugadi.

S Kiran Kumar, tehsildar of Saribujjilli mandal, said, “Roughly two acres of plots were made ready, however due to objections raised by the archaeology department, work has stopped. The work was carried out adjacent to the wall. However, it must be noted that this was under occupation (though a government site). The collector has issued orders to stop the work till further clarification.”

CHENNAI: If the days have become hot and the nights warmer, then expect temperatures to go up further in the coming days. Experts said temperatures may rise for one or two days for the rest of March and April as wind directions may be erratic during the day. IMD’s forecast for March to May season indicates a near normal temperature in the state.

According to regional meteorological centre’s forecast, the sky condition is likely to be partly cloudy. Maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to be around 33°C and 25°C in the city for the next 48 hours.

With warm seabreeze making days hot early evenings become unbearable due to rise in humidity levels. Humidity drops to a minimum of around 50% at around 11am and begins to rise around 3.30pm with the maximum of more than 90% recorded before sunrise.

Going by the data on extremes recorded in March in the last 10 years, temperatures have crossed 35°C mostly in the second half of the month. It touched 36.6°C on March 31, 2014, 36.1°C on March 22 and 23, 2016 and 35.7°C on March 29, 2019. 40.6°C recorded on March 29, 1953 is the all time recorded for the month.

However, IMD’s seasonal outlook for the temperatures during March-May 2020 has indicated near normal maximum and minimum temperatures for the state where it may be between -0.5°C and 0.5°C. “The forecast indicates March-April-May season average temperatures are likely to be warmer than normal by > 0.5°C over northwest, west and central India and some subdivisions from south India. Near normal temperatures are likely in the remaining subdivisions,” IMD said.

Weather blogger Pradeep John said the temperatures may rise only for one or two days and the overall pattern would be slightly above or below normal.

“Usually, both the easterlies or westerlies will not be strong. While in the evenings, we can expect seabreeze, mornings it will be mixed,” he said.

In the month of April, John said due to erratic wind directions, there may be convergence of winds in the interiors regions of the state that may bring rainfall. “There is no chance of rainfall in coastal areas,” he added.

285,['17/03/2020'],Prakasam district admin may take over water bodies for house sites,"Ongole: The Prakasam district administration is likely to take over water bodies for conversion of house sites. Citing shortage of government land and non-availability of suitable private land, the district administration has decided to grant house sites in the water bodies including canal poramboke, tank poramboke, vagu (stream) and tank beds.

Sources said that district collector Pola Bhaskar had directed the superintending engineer (SE) of irrigation department to conduct an inspection to identify whether the waterbodies could be converted as house sites.

He said that tehsildars had proposed to convert irrigation water bodies into house sites as there was no activity related to irrigation in such land. He also said that the tehsildars had sought permission for the transfer of water bodies for issuance of house sites due to shortage of government land.

Sources said that the irrigation department had objected to the proposal citing the Supreme Court guidelines. The senior officials in the irrigation department reported to have explained to the collector that conversion of water bodies would create new troubles and pose a big threat for conservation of water sources in future.

“The water bodies needed to be protected at any cost. They should not be utilized for any other purpose except for the needs of water,” said an irrigation official in an explanation to the district collector.

Sources, however, said that the district collector had once again sent a missive to the irrigation authorities to examine the issue with a positive mind as the issuance of house sites to the poor is one of the top priority programmes of the state government under Nava Rathnalu.

While Congress leader Raju Nair has locked horns with the Kolkata centre of Iskcon over whether cow urine-based hand sanitisers can be used or not, at Burrabazar , a BJP leader held a congregation and made a large number of people drink gaumutra, apparently to keep novel coronavirus at bay.The programme was organised by BJP leader Narayan Chatterjee at Burrabazar on Monday. First, a cow was bathed and worshipped for two hours inside a cowshed. Then, its urine was collected and mixed with a jar of cow urine BJP workers had brought with them.Subsequently, the cow worshippers walked through Jorabagan, offering the “cure” to people. Many, including a constable and some shopkeepers, even had it, saying they might as well, since there was no medicine or vaccine to fight the novel coronavirus now and anyway, “cow urine was known for its medicinal properties”.Scientists, however, slammed the act. Most said that while it was one thing to appreciate Vedic science as part of our tradition, only empirical evidence-based scientific conclusions should be followed. Partha Pratim Biswas, JU engineering faculty member, said, “The health protocol against novel coronavirus says a disinfectant must have 60% alcohol . How does cow urine match? Can we ask Iskcon to give us a break-up of the ingredients?” IIEST registrar Biman Bandyopadhyay said at these critical times, we need to step up scientific temper and accept something that has laboratory validation. “I am not saying ancient Vedic science should not be respected, but these are critical times and we need to be very careful. Is there proof that cow urine can kill virus?” he said.Senior IIT Kharagpur faculty Joy Sen clarified ancient Vedic science did validate benefits of cow urine. “These are mentioned in Charaksamhita and Sushruta. There’s no denying it. But if you talk about cow urine in isolation in the present context, it does not make sense. There is a holistic approach to these things and you will have to start with the word ‘Gau’, which in the finer context, means light…” he said.Describing the act unscientific, education minister Partha Chatterjee said, “These leaders look for gold in cow milk, no wonder they will look for nCoV cure in cow urine.” Deputy mayor Atin Ghosh called it “sheer madness”. “They should be put in zoo.

According to civic officials, some residents intentionally started the fire inside the under-construction shed at the site. They further said that a small fire was also burning continuously at the site for the last several weeks, which took an aggravated turn on Monday.

Nandkishore Bhombe, head of solid waste management cell, said that he received a call on Monday morning stating that the waste depot at Padegaon has caught fire and some people have gathered at the site. “We immediately sent fire tenders to the spot. However, we realised that over the last few days there have been incidents of theft in which the building construction material of the civil contractor was stolen and subsequent clashes of people with the civil contractor and waste processing the agency was going on,” he said.

He said that the civic body will be filing a complaint with the Cantonment Police Station against the people who started the fire inside the shed.

Bhombe said that the locals forcefully shut the plant after the fire grew. The civic officials reached the spot and resumed operations at the site.

Babasaheb Shelar, a resident, said that the waste at the site has been burning from the last 15 days. “The AMC is merely unloading heaps of mixed waste and has failed to stop the fire at the site,” he said.

The site currently receives waste from three zones i.e. around 40 wards. The civil work at the waste processing plant is underway, which has a capacity to treat over 150 tonnes of waste. The plant started pre-sorting and treating the wet waste at the site.

CHENNAI: Residents of Rajiv Gandi Salai are up in arms against a Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) move to build a temple on OMR-ECR Link Road, saying it would choke traffic and have an adverse impact on the ecologically sensitive area.

In a letter to chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Monday, Federation of OMR Residents Association (FOMRRA), an apex body of resident associations on the IT corridor, said the proposed land parcel for the temple is close to the Buckingham canal and is bound to create ecological issues. “The 2015 floods have shown how crucial the waterway is for this part of the city. Any development in its vicinity is bound to create serious ecological repercussions.”

The problems of OMR and Sholinganallur were not considered, it said, adding that Sholinganallur junction, surrounded by hospitals, hotels, educational institutions, IT parks and business houses, is almost 1km from the proposed site.

“On a normal working day, at least 55,000 vehicles/hour use the junction, taking anywhere between 30 minutes and 45 minutes to cross the junction,” the letter said, adding the need of the hour is to ease the traffic flow by investing over infrastructure projects, which still do not exist.

FOMRRA coordinator Harsha Koda said the objection was over gifting public land that belongs to the residents of OMR to a religious body without showing any regard to the completion of infrastructure projects. “We want the government to give priority to complete all the infrastructure projects,” he added.

It may be recalled that a high level TTD delegation met the chief minister on Sunday to formally lay the foundation stone for the temple on April 9.

CHANDIGARH: A deputy director of the Haryana animal husbandry and dairying department, who was under suspension, has been arrested for allegedly forging the documents to get admission in BVSc course 29 years ago.

Jaswant Singh Dahiya, was arrested on Saturday. The investigating agency is now probing the role of HAU, Hisar, registrar who is alleged to have helped Singh take admission.

The case was registered on the recommendation of the chief minister’s flying squad following a complaint lodged by Dr Ritu Singh, a vet posted in Sonipat. In her complaint, Ritu has alleged that Dahiya belongs to general category and, as he could not get adequate percentage in Class XII, he forged documents to get the scheduled caste certificate and took admission in the 1991 batch of BVSc course from HAU.

Ritu claimed that she had procured the details of his testimonials and fraud through the information under the RTI Act. She came to know, that after completing the degree course, Dahiya had first joined the Rajasthan government and then the Haryana government in 2004.

According to police, it took the flying squad five months to investigate and a case was registered earlier this month, following which Dahiya was arrested. “As we have procured the record related to his educational qualification and the caste certificate, we are now trying to identify those who issued the certificate and the person who then held the post of registrar,” police added. Sources said Dahiya was last posted in Sonipat and suspended after the department started investigations.

CHANDIGARH: Challenging his estranged elder brother to an electoral duel, senior Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader and Ellenabad MLA Abhay Singh Chautala told Ajay Singh Chautala that he was ready to resign and contest again from the same assembly seat (Ellenabad). If he failed to get re-elected, he would quit politics, Abhay said.

Abhay also asked Ajay to get his son, deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, to resign from Uchana and contest again. “If he fails to get re-elected from Uchana, they (Ajay’s family) should all fall at the feet of Om Prakash Chautala and apologise for their deceit,” Abhay said.

In a very sharp reaction, which probably marked the first such public expression after the protracted feud in the Chuatala clan, Abhay said, “They should not live in any illusion, let us resign and re-contest, they will get to know about their worth.”

Responding to the claim made by Ajay at the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) rally in Israna on March 13, Abhay said, “Let the mother (Ajay’s wife Naina Chautala ) and son (Dushyant) resign. I will resign from Ellenabad. They will realise how they won. People voted for them because they wanted to vote against the BJP but immediately after elections they deceived the public and joined hands with the BJP for selfish motives. People of the state of Haryana have faith in me,” Abhay said.

The INLD leader said had Congress not nominated Deepender Hooda to the Rajya Sabha, BJP would have fielded the third candidate and Hooda would have repeated the 2016 episode when Congress MLAs voted for the BJP-backed nominee instead of R K Anand. Not fielding the third candidate for the Rajya Sabha after Deepender’s nomination proved that the BJP and opposition Congress were acting as one in Haryana. “This time BJP has paid back Hooda,” he said.

Abhay said even JJP MLAs would have voted in RS as per their own choice. Taking a dig at the division among JJP MLAs, Abhay said the situation was such that all 10 legislators of the party couldn’t assemble at one place to hold a meeting. “They must be regretting their decision of going with him (Dushyant),” Abhay said. During the 2014 Parliamentary and state assembly elections, Dushyant and his mother Naina Chautala became MP and MLA from Hisar and Dabwali respectively because of his strong backing, he asserted.

Abhay claimed that Dushyant lost popularity with people of Haryana by joining hands with the BJP, which is why he could not visit his constituency of Uchana till date and thank people. After more than four months in power, not a single promise made by Dushyant during the 2019 assembly polls could be fulfilled, he alleged and appealed to the state government to release compensation immediately for crop loss due to rain and hailstorm.

Bazad said the process of receiving applications and uploading on the portal is still under progress. The farmers can submit their application by 5 pm on Tuesday. A physical survey will be conducted by insurance company and department officials to ascertain exact loss and compensation will be released accordingly.

Panipat deputy director of agriculture (DDA) Virender Arya said the area under the wheat in the district was 80,000 hectares, out of which around 25,000 hectares had been affected. “Higher crop damage has been reported in Israna and Madlauda blocks of Panipat.

The counsel for SEC submitted an affidavit stating the details of the action taken by it in the complaints received on electoral offences. He explained that they have submitted affidavit before court as there was not enough time. He added that they have transferred Guntur and Chittor district collectors and SP. The counsel also said they have suspended CIs of Macherla, Tirupati, Palamaneru, Tadipatri and other areas where instances of violence were reported.

The counsel for SEC stated that measures were taken to conduct elections in a fair and transparent manner. They prohibited an MLA from campaigning for one day after receiving a complaint against him. Reports from district collectors were taken on regular basis, he stated.

P Veera Reddy, counsel for Ravindra alleged that the ruling party has unleashed violence to coerce opposition party leaders.

312,['17/03/2020'],BSY mends fences; loyalists say he’s indispensable to BJP,"Bengaluru: With a section of legislators and senior MLAs raising a banner of revolt against him, chief minister BS Yediyurappa is personally reaching out to disgruntled legislators in a bid to quell the rebellion.

An MLA said Yediyurappa is meeting each disgruntled leader and lending an ear to their grievances. “He has called each one of us for a meeting to hear us out and we’re happy about it,” he added.

However, this may not be enough as the legislators want Yediyurappa’s family members to be kept out of the administration. “We can see the change in the CM’s attitude but he should ensure his son BY Vijayendra doesn’t take a call on important issues,’’ said another senior legislator.

However, another section of MLAs loyal to Yediyurappa, which is unhappy with the development in the party, is meeting national leaders and urging them not to get carried away by reports of dissent. “Some disgruntled MLAs are running a fallacious campaign against Yediyurappa to get cabinet berths and there is absolutely no dissent,” said a senior MLA.

According to them, the Lingayat strongman is still indispensable to the party since they can’t think of anyone who’s capable of stepping in his shoes as of now, though several names are doing the rounds.

National leaders too are convinced with Yediyurappa’s leadership as the BJP under him has been growing in strength while the opposition Congress and JD(S) are disintegrating due to infighting and weak leadership.

After winning 104 seats in the 2018 assembly elections, Yediyurappa has consolidated his position by bringing the party to power and ensuring its stability by clinching 12 of the 15 seats in the bypolls.

On the anonymous letters seeking his replacement on age grounds, Yediyurappa loyalists said their leader single-handedly managed the flood and drought situation by visiting 22 districts in seven days as he had no full-fledged cabinet. “He has been managing the state when it’s reeling under a severe financial crisis by presenting one of the best budgets in such circumstances. What more can you ask for,” said a senior MLA.

Meanwhile, English and Foreign Languages University (Eflu) has decided to shut its hostels, messes while also suspending classes. It has asked students to vacate the campus by March 18 while Maulana Azad National Urdu University (Manuu) is said to have asked students to vacate by March 20.“Giving us a day and saying that water and electricity will be cut does not make any sense,” said a PhD student from OU. “It is like sending us to affected areas from this safe space,” said a Eflu student from Bengaluru. He added that it made little sense to send students from coronavirus-affected states such as Maharashtra , Kerala, Karnataka back home. “Once we come back, what kind of screening method will be followed as we could all be carriers of the virus,” he said.President of Manuu student union, Umer Farooq, said that most students wanted to stay back. “We were asked to vacate by March 20 but as many as 400 students want to stay back,” Farooq said.

The jump in prices came as a rude shock to many travellers, especially outstation students , who have been forced to return following closure of their hostels . “I tried to book a flight, but the tickets are currently very expensive.

BENGALURU: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) on Monday asked the Centre to engage with opposition parties to dispel doubts and misinformation surrounding the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“The national issues are being unnecessarily politicised. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah should hold talks with opposition leaders to clear their confusion,’’ RSS general secretary Suresh ‘Bhaiyyaji’ Joshi said here on Monday, while briefing mediapersons on the resolutions passed by Akhil Bharatiya Karyakadi Mandal in Bengaluru.

The three-day annual meet of Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS) was scheduled to start on Sunday but was cancelled at the last minute in view of Covid-19 concerns.

Joshi said BJP should bring different political parties together and make them understand the concepts of CAA, NPR and NRC. The Centre must also hold talks with other states to clear their doubts in the backdrop of some states refusing to implement the federal law.

Kerala, Punjab and Rajasthan have also passed resolutions against CAA. Other states opposing the move are West Bengal, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh along with Delhi and Puducherry.

Joshi said the aim of certain leaders was to create confusion. “Many leaders have tried to do so. The PM and home minister have on several occasions appealed to them to understand the Act but they are reluctant because for them politics is more important than the nation’s interest,’’ he said.

In its resolution, the RSS has said there’s an “atmosphere of imaginary fear and confusion in the minds of a section of people, created by the jihadi-Left combine with the support of selfish political parties involved in communal politics and some foreign forces, who are making nefarious efforts to spread violence and anarchy across the country”.

It has demanded a thorough investigation be initiated against protests and appropriate action be taken against the forces which are trying to destroy communal harmony and national integrity.

BENGALURU: A 31-year-old newlywed Bengalurean filed a police complaint seeking action against his wife, after he received a video showing her in a compromising position with another man two days before they were to consummate their marriage.

Sandesh (name changed), a resident of Subramanyanagar, said he married Sonia (name changed) of Chikkamagaluru on November 24, 2019 in Hassan. They had been engaged in June. Sandesh works with a private firm, while Sonia is a government employee.

Sandesh said he spent Rs 1.2 lakh for the engagement and Rs 7.6 lakh for the marriage. Their first night was scheduled for December 15.

“On the night of December 13, I received on Facebook Messenger photographs of my wife indulging in sexually explicit acts with another man. A mobile number was provided with the pictures. I dialled the number and the person from the other side introduced himself as Ramesh (name changed), who said Sonia and he were in a relationship for seven years,” Sandesh said in his complaint.

According to Sandesh, Ramesh claimed he and Sonia continued their physical relationship even after her engagement on June 30, 2019. “Later, I received a porn video from Ramesh, showing Sonia and him sharing some intimate moments. Then, I received screenshots of WhatsApp messages exchanged between Ramesh and Sonia on the nights of December 10 and 12. Sonia in one of the messages tells that she likes Ramesh while her family members like me. Further, Sonia says she is ready to spurn me,” Sandesh’s complaint read.

After receiving the porn clips, a shell-shocked Ramesh filed a complaint with Hassan police in December 2019, seeking an inquiry into the pictures and video. “Police arrested Ramesh, who confessed to having an affair with Sonia for seven years. I was deeply depressed over the developments and my family members are still in shock,” he said.

Woman’s suicide threat

According to Subramanyanagar police, Sandesh sought legal intervention to prove Sonia had an affair and cheated him by withholding the information, while her parents too were aware of their daughter’s relationship.

Sandesh claimed Sonia’s maternal uncle threatened him against going to police. “Sonia is threatening to commit suicide after leaving behind a note, accusing Sandesh and his family of abetting her suicide,” the complainant said.

Based on Sandesh’s statement, police have registered a case under IPC sections 406 (breach of trust) and 506 (criminal intimidation).

“It’s a complicated case as we have don’t have much freedom to probe. With the help of pictures and video evidence, we have to prove that Sonia cheated Sandesh. We have approached a legal adviser for more clarity,” an investigating officer said.

BENGALURU: Basavanagudi police have arrested four men, including a 30-year-old man who escaped police custody. All four were involved in chain-snatching incidents reported from Bengaluru and elsewhere in Karnataka.

Mohammed Rafeeq, 30, a resident of Dakshina Kannada district; Imran Khan, 35, from Shivamogga; Anees PT, 30 and Shafeeq, both from Kerala, landed in police net. Their fifth associate, Syed, is still absconding.

In December, Puttur police arrested Rafeeq but he managed to escape while being escorted to prison from court. By then, Imran, another habitual offender, had been released from prison. The duo teamed up to snatch gold chains in Bengaluru.

Rafeeq and Imran were using a scooter without a numberplate to snatch chains. There were nine cases registered against them in the first two months of this year. The duo used to hand over the gold chains to Anees and Shafeeq, who sold them in Kerala. The gold ornaments were swapped for money in Mysuru.

Acting on a tip that the quartet was meeting in a Myuru lodge, police swooped down on them and arrested the four.

Police said they were able to recover gold ornaments weighing 422gm and worth Rs 17 lakh, which they had sold to lead a lavish life. Besides cases in Bengaluru, Rafeeq has 15 cases against him in Dakshina Kannada and Shivamogga districts, which include robbery, dacoity and chain-snatching.

322,['17/03/2020'],Bengaluru: KIA janitor trying to sell gold biscuits in police network,"The six gold biscuits worth Rs 27.6 lakh recovered from Anjappa (inset), a janitor at Bengaluru airport

BENGALURU: A janitor looking to make a fortune landed in police net while trying to sell his loot to a local trader.

Anjappa, 28, who worked as a housekeeping staffer at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), managed to lay his hands on nearly 700gm of gold biscuits , which he managed to smuggle out of the airport. Anjappa, a resident of Shettihalli village in Chintamani taluk, about 73km from Bengaluru, had six gold biscuits, each weighing 116gm.

Going by the day’s bullion rates, police estimated the total worth of the gold to be around Rs 27.6 lakh. While probe is yet to shed light on who handed over the gold bars to the janitor, those probing the case ruled out the man’s involvement in any known gold-smuggling ring.

Anjappa was arrested based on a tip-off from a jewellery store owner in Chintamani, where he was trying to sell the gold. Anjappa approached the jeweller at 11.30am on Saturday and claimed his brother was living in Dubai and had sent him two gold biscuits.

“He said he wanted to sell them and buy agricultural land. Suspecting something amiss, the owner informed Chintamani rural police head constable Satish. Police went to the spot and caught Anjappa, who said he got the gold from his friends,” police said. Probe revealed Anjappa worked as a housekeeping staffer at KIA. He claimed he got the gold biscuits while at work. “He told us that two months ago, while he was cleaning the men’s washroom, an unknown person came to him and handed over a covered small bag and told him to give it to him outside. But when he went outside, the person wasn’t there,” said police.

He then learned that the cover contained six gold biscuits, which he decided to keep. “This was the first time he tried to sell them,” they added.

Not caught in security check

Police sources said it was surprising how Anjappa managed to escape security check at the airport. However, customs sources said employees get passes and have access to certain areas. There are various exit points for employees and Anjappa might have used one where he wasn’t subjected to a security check.

He was produced before the court and has been handed over to police custody till Tuesday. Customs officials at KIA too are looking into the matter. “We are yet to know who gave him the gold biscuits,” said police.

Jahnavi S, in-charge superintendent of police, Chikkaballapura said probe is under way and they cannot divulge more information at this point.

BENGALURU: Mere recovery of money from a bribery case accused is not enough for the prosecution to claim he/she is guilty, the high court said, while acquitting an education department official.

“Unless evidence of the complainant and shadow-witness corroborate with each other, it is not safe to convict the accused. Recovery of money from the accused itself is not sufficient to convict him/her when evidence in the case is not reliable,” Justice K Somashekar observed. He acquitted Jagadeesh, who had been convicted by a special Lokayukta court in Davanagere in 2011.

Jagadeesh, who was working as an educational coordinator, had allegedly demanded Rs 2,000 for closing a misappropriation case against M Sreenivasmurthy, the complainant. In a trap laid by Lokayukta police, Jagadeesh was caught allegedly accepting Rs 2,000 from the complainant on April 7, 2007.

On March 24, 2011, the trial court convicted Jagadeesh under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and sentenced him to one-year simple imprisonment. Jagadeesh challenged this verdict in the high court.

In his appeal, Jagadeesh claimed Sreenivasamurthy is not only a man of questionable character but also put his colleagues into trouble, and that wasn’t considered by the trial court even though it was submitted as evidence.

When contacted, Osmanabad district collector Deepa Mudhol Munde, who is also the chairman of the temple trust, said, “Though the number of locals visiting the temple had reduced, people from outside the district and state continued to pay visit. Hence, the decision to shut it.”

Temple administrator Yogita Kolhe said a review of the decision would be taken after March 31, depending upon the situation then.

Temple’s manager for religious affairs, Siddheshwar Intule, told TOI that the money deposited for performing special ‘puja’ would be returned. “If people do not want the money back, they will be given any future date for the same.”

The trustees said people can opt for online darshan by visiting the temple’s website. However, the rituals such as puja would be allowed only after the temple is reopened.

325,['17/03/2020'],BJP MLAs: Govt hasn’t taken steps to check monkey fever,"Bengaluru: BJP MLAs Haratalu Halappa and Araga Jnanendra took the government to task for its alleged failure to respond to the threat posed by Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), commonly known as monkey fever , in parts of Shivamogga, Chikkamagaluru and Uttara Kannada district.

They alleged 23 people have lost their lives to the disease since last year, but the government has not taken steps to contain it or provide timely treatment to the afflicted.

“I’m tired of raising this issue time and again. Four people have died this year alone, but the health department is in deep slumber,” said Halappa while bringing up the topic during Zero Hour.

He said the entire government machinery is fighting to contain Covid-19 but showing utter negligence towards KFD, which is affecting poor forest dwellers. He said the previous government had parked three ventilator- fitted ambulances in Sagar taluk to ferry patients to hospital but this government has withdrawn them.

Jnanendra alleged: “Even after deaths, health department officers remain unconcerned. I wonder if they will wake up even if the disease affects their family members.”

Halappa claimed the government owes around Rs 8 lakh to Manipal Hospital, where KFD patients were referred for treatment last year. “It has been refusing to admit patients this year,” he said.

Speaker Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri said one person has died in his constituency, urging the government address the issue on priority.

Health minister B Sriramulu, in his reply, read out statistics on the number of people affected. “We don’t want numbers. We want results,” responded Halappa, who dismissed the minister’s claim that 15 people have died due to the disease.

Later, Sriramulu said he would soon convene a meeting of MLAs from KFD-affected taluks with the CM to debate the issue. He said the government has decided to open a research centre in Sagar to develop a vaccine for KFD and six acres of land has been allotted for the purpose.

Will deploy ambulances, clear hosp dues: Govt

The government announced it would deploy three ambulances in KFD-affected taluks besides taking steps to get patients treated at Manipal Hospital. “The government will pay all dues to the hospital immediately,” said Javed Akhtar, additional chief secretary, health department.

Lucknow: The novel coronavirus outbreak has reversed the business boom that the tourism industry had witnessed during the defence exposition in the city in February, with losses estimated at over Rs 100 crore in less than three weeks.

More than 80 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the country, including 12 in UP, and prompted India to suspend all visas (barring those issued to diplomats, officials from UN/international organisations, etc.) till April 15. This has obviously slowed down tourist traffic.

According to officials at UP Tourism, business is down by 30% in comparison to March 2019, with losses breaching the Rs 100 crore mark in just 20 days. City hotels are seeing an average occupancy of 40%, which is exactly half of what is usually witnessed in March.

“It is scary. In the last week of February, business was down by 15%. In March, the figure has just doubled. Cancellations are happening in everywhere, be it hotels, airlines or events. Many who had booked a visit to the city next month have abandoned plans too,” said regional tourism officer Anupam Srivastava.

Another tourism department official said tourist guides and vendors were nearly jobless. “There has been a massive decline in footfall at monuments. The tourism industry as a whole has come to a standstill and will remain thus for at least sometime,” he observed.

Pratik Hira of the Indian Association of Tour Operators said the industry would end its financial year with heavy losses, as the country has put a blanket ban on incoming traffic from abroad.

“Hotel occupancy was at 100% during DefExpo in the first week of February. Every year, hotels have 80-90% occupancy in March since many tourists throng the city and state during Holi and other festivals. This time, it is down to 40%,” Hira confirmed the slump.

Hitesh Ahuja, the spokesperson for a 4-star hotel in Gomtinagar, said the hospitality industry might have to lose staff if business goes from bad to worse. “As on Friday, we had only 5-10 families in the hotel. Refunds have been made to those who cancelled. We have also had to lower prices by 5%,” he said.

BENGALURU: Mohammed Nalapad Haris , son of Shantinagar MLA NA Haris, on Monday filed a complaint against activist Sachin Gowda , stating the latter threatened him at a Youth Congress event on Sunday. Gowda then filed a counter-complaint, saying Nalapad allegedly slapped him on the face and threatened him with dire consequences.

Based on Nalapad’s complaint, police registered a non-cognisable report (NCR) against Gowda, while an FIR was registered against the MLA’s son under sections 341 (unlawful restraint) and 323 (causing hurt).

On Sunday, Nalapad and Gowda participated in an elocution competition organised by the Youth Congress, where a heated argument is said to have broken out after Gowda questioned the organisers why one of the sons of an MLA was not invited to the dais during prize distribution.

Deputy commissioner of police (central) Chetan Singh Rathor said they will question both men before proceeding with investigation. “Gowda’s statement reads that Nalapad allegedly slapped him and his personal security threatened him with dire consequences. Nalapad, who filed the complaint first, said Gowda shouted at him, saying he will defame him in media,” Rathor said.

Nalapad’s statement

In his statement, a copy of which is with TOI, Nalapad said the Youth Congress had organised the competition between 3pm and 8am, and he’d participated in the event. “... Prizes were distributed to five winners and at this time, a person called Sachin Gowda asked Imran, the in-charge city Youth Congress president, why a person named Gautham, whose father was an MLA, wasn’t invited to the dais. Imran told him Sachin needn ’t interfere with the party’s internal matter,” Nalapad’s statement read.

He said the matter didn’t end there and Sachin questioned Youth Congress vice-president Shivakumar, which led to a quarrel between the two. “... At this time, Karnataka Youth Congress president Basanagouda Badarli had to intervene and I also advised Sachin to stop arguing. However, he began speaking to me without respect. I responded by telling him that I was the city Youth Congress president and that the matter was in my jurisdiction. He then threatened me, and our party workers escorted him outside,” Nalapad added.

What Sachin had to say

Gowda, while conceding that he had questioned the organisers about why Gautham was not on the dais, said: “... A heated argument broke out and many of them started abusing me. Then, Mohammed Nalapad Haris came near me and shouted. I asked him to be polite when he suddenly slapped me. His personal bodyguards abused me and threatened me with dire consequences.”

Vadodara: Despite not a single positive case of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, capacity at both private and public hospitals is being enhanced as part of precautionary measure to combat COVID-19.

The state-run SSG Hospital which was the first one to set up an isolation ward now has capacity to admit 24 patients. At the GMERS Gotri Hospital, the capacity of isolation ward was ten which is being scaled up to 15.

“At the two major government hospitals, currently 39 beds facility has been created,” said Vadodara district collector Shalini Agrawal, who also held a meeting with representatives of private hospitals.

Six private hospitals have also set up isolation wards that can accommodate 32 patients. These include Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Sterling Hospital, Tricolours Hospital, Shukun Hospital, Bankers Hospital and Savita Hospital.

“Both government and private hospitals presently have 71 bed capacity. We have asked the private hospitals to enhance their capacity further. SSG Hospital too is equipped to increase its capacity,” said Agrawal.

The State Institute of Health and Family Welfare has created quarantine facility for 71 persons at Ajwa Road as part of precautionary measure.

Sources said that this facility has been set up so as to accommodate those who test positive and need not require intensive care at SSG or other private hospitals.

“In the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) areas, 351 persons have been screened. Samples of seven of them were collected and all of them have tested negative,” she said.

“In VMC areas too quarantine and observation facilities are being created. The staff at community health centre and public health centres, ASHA workers, community health officers, anganwadi workers have already been sensitised while doctors of private hospitals are being trained,” she said.

BOX: 18 stores penalised for overpricing masks

Vadodara: The district administration has penalised 18 stores for selling masks at exorbitant prices. The stores had to pay Rs 30,000 as penalty for overcharging masks.

“The government has already put masks and hand sanitisers under Essential Commodities Act (ECA) to ensure proper availability of these items in market at correct price and our teams are constantly keeping a check on pricing,” said Vadodara district collector Shalini Agrawal.

She, however, appealed citizens to wash their hands properly and frequently with soap instead of relying on hand sanitisers as the former is a better hygiene practice.

KOLKATA: At least 15 cars were damaged after a group of people, allegedly in an inebriated condition, went on the rampage at Martinpara grounds , located next to the Ambedkar FP School near Purba Panchannagram off EM Bypass. The incident took place in the wee hours of Saturday.

While locals claimed that they were not clear about the reason behind the incident, an FIR, lodged with Anandapur police station on Sunday, stated it might be an outcome of parking extortion.

The main complainant Abdul Sahadat (32), a transporter and resident of the area, claimed that at least three persons had demanded parking fees from him. “Total 18 cars, most of which are app cabs, are being parking at this spot in the past several years. I refused to pay the fees to them who were not government-appointed parking attendants. Then, the accused started damaging the cars parked there,” said an aide of Sahadat.

According to locals, the spot, where the damaged cars were parked, belongs to the government and a school building is coming up there. The rest of the area is used as a dumping ground. A syndicate has been trying to grab the spot, they claimed. “The accused demanded parking fee from the complainant for extortion . After his refusal, they broke the windscreens of several cars belonging to the complainant and others,” stated the FIR. Among the IPC sections slapped on the accused are 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion) and 427 (mischief). The parking syndicate holds its sway in several pockets of the city, especially in the southeast part of Kolkata.

Exactly two years ago, the Karaya area saw a clash among two such syndicates that saw 18 vehicles being damaged. The gangs “flourish” in the heart of the city because of a boom in illegal constructions. The parking mafias thrive in the atreas where people don’t get garage facilities, said an officer of Lalbazar.

“I had recently made a point for people to ponder. It has quietly become a whirlpool already and will go on to become a wave. As the wave gets closer to the shore and elections draw closer, it will surely turn into a political tsunami. A miracle and a wonder will happen in Tamil Nadu,” Rajinikanth said on Monday, while addressing a gathering at a function in Chennai organized by a YouTube channel.

“After my speech last week, I was told that people were saying I may not enter politics at all. I was also told that a section of people chided me for not bringing in the change myself and instead asking people to usher in that change. They are not aware that the point I raised is already being discussed wildly by people,” Rajinikanth said.

Recalling that changes in Tamil Nadu politics were brought in by waves, he referred about former chief minister M G Ramachandran. He described MGR as “a great man and a good human, who helped several people and the needy”. MGR worked hard in DMK for 25 years and was instrumental in M Karunanidhi becoming chief minister. But, he was thrown out of the party, for which he was the treasurer, for raising questions, Rajinikanth said. “Had MGR resigned, he would not have been this successful. He was thrown out and he went to the people and generated a sympathy wave that made him the chief minister,” he said.

In 1991, former AIADMK leader J Jayalalithaa in alliance with the Congress, faced the polls. The assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi created a wave against the DMK and helped Jayalalithaa become the chief minister for the first time, he said. It was the ‘Telugu pride’ wave that helped N T Rama Rao to come to power in Andhra Pradesh in 1983, he added.

Rajinikanth also sought to draw a parallel to how Chanakya, the ancient philosopher-royal advisor helped a young Chandra Gupta Maurya become a king and build the Mauryan empire. “I have made the speech. My fans and the people are the kings who will turn it into a wave. Whether it will become a tsunami is in the hands of God,” he concluded.

The HC has issued an advisory in this regard, following which, the prison superintendents from across the state have started reaching out to their respective Principal District Judges.

The state has nine central prisons, 31 district prisons, 19 open prisons, one open colony and 172 sub-jails. There are two separate prisons for women at Pune and Mumbai, apart from two open prisons for women, situated at Pune and Akola.

U T Pawar, the superintendent of Yerawada central prison in Pune, told TOI they would be carrying out all the hearing and trial of the cases through video conferencing only from Tuesday.

As on date, about 5,800 inmates are lodged in the prison, and all those being remanded to Yerawada, either after conviction or after being remanded in judicial custody are being screened by the medical officer posted at the prison, sanitized, before being taken in, he said.

As a precautionary measure, all the prisons are mandatorily screening all the accused or convicts, before letting them inside the prison premises. At Nagpur central prison, which has over 2,400 inmates, apart from screening and recording temperature of the suspects and accused reaching the prison, they are also being made to wash their hands, face and feet using soaps kept at the newly installed water tank at the prison’s entrance gate.

When contacted, Nagpur central prison superintendent Anupkumar Kumre said, “In addition to screening and sanitizing prisoners at the entrance gate, we have also set up multiple drums of boiled water in which clothes of all the inmates are being soaked before being washed. The clothes are further being washed in water with disinfectants.”

In addition to this, to boost immunity of the inmates, Nagpur central prison has included lemon and amla to their diet. The authorities have also started mixing liquid disinfectant in the water tanks so that the inmates get disinfected while bathing.

Authorities at the Aurangabad central prison have also started serving lemon water and leafy vegetables to the 1,100 inmates in the premises. “All the accused being remanded to our prison are being screened at the entrance gate using electronic thermometer. They are also being made to wash their hands, face and feet before entering,” Aurangabad central prison superintendent Hiralal Jadhav told TOI.

He has also made a representation to the principal district judge, Aurangabad with request to carry out all the hearings and trials of the inmates through video conferencing only.

The Aurangabad prison authorities are separately recording names of those freshly remanded to the prison, so that they can be monitored for any symptoms of coronavirus and action taken.

A total of 72 persons have been screened for COVID-19 so far, of which 53 persons already passed the 40 days observation period.

“In Vadodara district, there are presently 19 persons who are under observation and have been quarantined but none of them have tested positive. So, there is no need to panic,” said Vadodara district collector Shalini Agrawal.

Presently, 65-year-old Karjan native who had returned from the United States before two weeks is the only patient admitted in the isolation ward of SSG Hospital. After he returned from US, Patel had some symptoms similar to COVID-19.

“His condition is stable and his samples which were sent for checking are also negative,” said Dr Rajeev Daveshwar, medical superintendent of SSG Hospital.

Those who have been screened are not just foreign nationals but also those who have visited foreign countries recently.

“Some of those screened had been to Bangkok, Thailand and other tourist destinations or those who have returned from United States via some or other route,” said Daveshwar.

On Saturday, two Chinese nationals, husband-wife duo, had also undergone screening at SSG Hospital. The duo presently working with Chinese-firm TBEA, had no specific symptoms of COVID-19 and were directed for home quarantine.

342,['17/03/2020'],Property tax hike not stopped for local body poll: Minister,"Representative image

CHENNAI: DMK legislator from Singanallur, N Karthik, on Monday said the state government’s decision to withhold the (much criticized) hike in property tax was taken considering the local body polls , attracting a retort from municipal administration minister S P Velumani.

“The government hiked the property tax, much against public wish, but has withheld the hike due to local body elections,” said Karthik, in the assembly .

In response to the legislator, Velumani pointed out that the previous hike in property tax was during the DMK regime in 2008 and that the ruling AIADMK had hiked the property tax from July 2018 only after directions from the Madras high court. Last November, the minister announced a roll back of the hike in urban local bodies following representations from residents about the steep hike.

The tax revision came about arbitrarily without any consultation from the residents. Residents were also shocked by the quantum of tax hike — as against the promise of keeping maximum hike at 50%, some localities had complained that taxes have been increased by up to 600%.

The minister further said a committee has been appointed to examine the issues and that a decision will be taken after they submit their report. He questioned whether the DMK MLA was unhappy with the withholding of the property tax hike.

During the 2018-19 financial year, Greater Chennai Corporation had collected Rs 1,002.64 crore in property tax — the first time the Rs 1,000-crore mark was breached. The civic body had collected around Rs 607 crore as property tax during the first half-year of 2019-2020 that ended on September 30, after which the government withheld the hike.

In a stark contrast, in the rural districts, Rs 261.77 crore was collected as property tax for the year 2019-20, which includes house tax and property tax from self-financing educational institutions in 36 rural districts.

Of the 36 rural districts, Chengalpet collected the maximum of Rs 23.19 crore. Kancheepuram stood second by collecting Rs 21.69 crore.

KOLKATA: The city has been losing some rare species of trees and birds. A preliminary report on the city’s biodiversity has revealed that indigenous varieties of trees like banyan, peepal, mango, kalojam, babul, dumur and neem are becoming scarce compared to the study that was conducted some decades ago.

Kolkata had reported a reasonably rich biodiversity till 1944, according to a study on the city’s biodiversity during the Raj era when the city had as many as 276 species of trees.

Of these, 61 species were identified as endemic, 96 as naturalized in the the city, 41 as truly indigenous, 20 as native of other parts of India.

Six species were introduced from North America and one each from Malaya and Africa.

However, urbanization over the years has led to changes in the species. Some of the studies conducted on the city’s biodiversity reveal that at least 21% of the species disappeared from the city in the past 64 years.

A recent study (2006—2010) has also indicated that of the 276 species of trees, 58 have vanished. Some of the species, which have disappeared, include Jhau, Muchukundu and Kath Bimla, Jayanti and Hari Kakra among others.

Similarly, several species of birds have become rare in the city over the past three decades.

According to a ward-wise study conducted by several NGOs and students from premier schools and colleges, birds like herons, kingfishers, woodpeckers, fishing eagles, vultures are no longer seen due to filling of waterbodies and rapid construction of housing complexes, especially in the added areas like Behala, Jadavpur, Tollygunge and large areas located off Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. Even sparrows or mynahs have become scarce these days, said a senior official of the KMC parks department who had helped a group of NGOs conduct a survey on the city’s vanishing birds.

“Frequent filling of ponds and water bodies and felling of trees have made it impossible for some species of birds to stay within the city. Kingfishers, woodpeckers or herons can still be seen in the areas where there is greenery or water body left for their survival,” said the civic official.

The new report also highlights the plight of butterflies in the growing urbanization.

According to a study among 1,501 species of butterflies, 84 are still found in Kolkata.

“However, we need to protect them as several of such species are under the threat of extinction,” said a KMC parks department official.

Taking strong objection to the state commission’s decision to postpone the local body elections due to the threat posed by novel coronavirus, Yadav said it was a conspiracy by the TDP to deprive the state of central funds and save its face from imminent defeat.

Speaking to reporters at the YSRC party’s central office here on Monday, Yadav said: “The election commission did not take into confidence the concerned officials in the government but seems to have taken the decision at the behest of TDP and cited coronavirus as a reason. Speaking of coronavirus, the virus’ spread has been severe in France which has registered 5,500 cases and has recorded over 125 deaths. Even in such a situation, the local body elections were held and the polling percentage was recorded at 55%. The actual intention of postponing the elections seems to be a conspiracy only to help Chandrababu Naidu who has given him the high office of SEC.”

While both sellers and buyers look forward to the madness, everyone is on the edge this year. BothKMC and functionaries at Gariahat Indira Hawkers’ Union are jittery over the safety of buyers and sellers while ensuring fears don’t scuttle sales.Mayor Firhad Hakim acknowledged that Chaitra sale at Gariahat was a worry since it led to congregation of lakhs of people, something that the government was otherwise trying to prevent now, by putting embargoes on sporting events and shutting down educational institutions. “We are taking measures to prevent the virus from spreading in Kolkata. Fortunately, no positive case has been recorded in the city yet. But we have to take all precautions and cannot let our guard down. At Gariahat, we plan to set up medical kiosks that will be manned by doctors from KMC and health department to attend to any emergency situation. There will also be an ambulance on standby,” the mayor said.The sale ahead of the Bengali new year attracts around 50 lakh-60 lakh customers, 90% of whom shop in the last fortnight. While the prevention protocol calls for social distancing and a minimum distance of 2m, the trade along narrow pavements has shoppers rubbing shoulders and jostling with each other.Debraj Ghosh, general-secretary of the Gariahat Indira Hawkers’ Union that controls a majority of vendors at Gariahat, said the union, too, was concerned about the sale in times of a global epidemic. “We don’t want Chaitra Sale to be scrapped as many earn their living from hawking. At the same time, we would not like to be seen as irresponsible and triggering an outbreak. Thus, we have decided on certain basic measures and will finalize them after a general body meeting with hawkers within the next couple of days,” said Ghosh.Among the proposals that are being considered is distribution of masks to all hawkers and instruction that they wear them during business hours. Installing hand sanitizer dispensers at every stall has also been proposed so that both vendors and customers can use them after transactions. “We are in a business, where people will come in contact with each other. We will try to ensure that hawkers conduct their trade in a file on the pavement and do not constrict the space further.

The minister announced that a study will be undertaken to look at the possibility of converting run-down commercial complexes owned by the city corporation into modern shopping malls. There are 153 such complexes in the city, most of which are in dilapidated state.

Apart from this, seven foot over-bridges with escalator facilities will be built at Rs 45 crore. The FoBs are to come up at Luz Church Road, LB Road, Sardar Patel Road, Arcot Road, Anna Nagar 2nd and 3rd Avenues and on Purasawalkam High Road.

CHENNAI: Retrieving India’s sovereignty over Katchatheevu , thereby restoring the fishing rights of Indian fishermen , alone will be the permanent solution for the ‘vexatious’ problem faced by fishermen, the Tamil Nadu government has told the Madras high court .

Tamil Nadu said it had been taking proactive steps for retrieval of Katchatheevu, which was ceded unilaterally to Sri Lanka by India in 1974. Its retrieval alone would protect the traditional fishing rights of Tamil Nadu fishermen, it said, adding that the state has filed a petition in the Supreme Court that is still pending.

The state fisheries department also said after the end of civil war in Sri Lankan in 2009, incidents of shooting/ harassment/ apprehension of Indian fishermen by Sri Lankan navy have ‘drastically’ reduced. “In the past two decades, 67 incidents of shooting and attack by Lankan navy were reported, in which 26 fishermen died and 62 were injured. But in the last decade, only 5 such incidents have been reported, in which 2 died and 4 were injured,” G S Sameeran, director of state fisheries department, said.

The submissions were made before a division bench of Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice R Suresh Kumar in response to a PIL moved by Fishermen Care – a fishermen rights organisation seeking to rehabilitate families of fishermen who were attacked or killed by Lankan navy. Further hearing of the case was adjourned to after six weeks.

Explaining various schemes introduced by the state to help families of such fishermen, the fisheries department said, “To support the livelihood of the families of fishermen who are apprehended by the Lankan navy while fishing, the state government is providing a daily allowance of Rs 250 till they return home.” Immediate ex-gratia of Rs 3 lakh is granted to the family of fishermen who die in Lankan navy attacks. In cases, where the deceased is the sole breadwinner of the family, additional solatium of Rs 5 lakh is provided. If they sustain injuries in the attacks they are paid between Rs 50,000 to Rs 20,000, the government said.

Besides, alternative livelihood opportunity is being provided to bereaved families by encouraging cultivation of seaweed, especially in the Palk Bay region. Several self-help groups and youth groups are involved in seaweed cultivation, the department said.

I was extremely disappointed and thus, I decided to cycle across the country with the message of — say no to rape,” said Hyderabad resident Chandrakanth Hodepally (aka Chandu), who reached Uttarakhand on Sunday.

The 20-year-old youth started his journey on January 1, 2020, and after two-and-a-half months of cycling, he has covered several states including Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and now Uttarakhand. Chandu has also cycled across Jammu and Kashmir.

“I plan to cover the north-eastern states next. I will go there via Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar. My 30,000 km long journey will conclude at Kanyakumari. I hope to complete the journey by July, 2020. I have cycled for more than 10,000 kilometres,” said Chandu.

When asked about funding of his journey, Chandu said, “This journey has been possible because of crowd funding. Those from cycling community have helped me a lot. People whom I meet during my journey offer me food and money. I spend my nights at petrol pumps, Gurudwaras, or just camp somewhere.”

On his experience in Uttarakhand, Chandu said, “People of Uttarakhand are very friendly and supportive. I was offered food by a man who owns a mobile eatery in Dehradun . I will stay here for another couple of days before heading towards UP.”

On being asked if he would cut short his trip due to Covid-19, Chandu said that he would not culminate his journey but avoid going into cities where foreign tourists come in large numbers.

Chandu feels that his journey would make people more aware of crime against woman. “I notice that women, who face molestation, are often made to keep silence. Instead of putting restrictions on girls, our society must punish the predators,” said Chandu.

The SEC also directed the government to transfer at least five DSPs and suspend the Macherla inspector.However, till Monday evening, the government had not implemented the SEC’s orders. Meanwhile, chief secretary Nilam Sawheny wrote a letter to the SEC on Monday to reconsider its decision to postpone the elections.Information and public relations minister Perni Nani told TOI that the government will take a call on the issue after consulting the advocate general and senior officials. “The SEC’s directive has many contradictions. He says coronovirus is the reason for the postponement of the elections. In such a case, where is the need for the transfer of officials?” asked Nani.The minister further said there is another contradiction about continuing the model code of conduct when the elections have been postponed. “If the elections were postponed on natural calamity grounds, there should not be any code to handle the crisis. We are taking legal opinion whether the SEC has the power to transfer officials when there is no model code of conduct in vogue,” said Nani, while adding that they have every right to question the SEC’s decisions as they are “politically motivated”.Sources said the government might not implement the SEC’s instructions as it has already filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the decision. The government appealed in its petition to direct the SEC to continue the election process as per the original schedule in order to save public money and effectively launch the battle against coronavirus. The government is contending that the presence of public representatives at local bodies would help it spread awareness among the general public and take measures to quarantine people.Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has already raised his objection to the SEC’s decision to remove the collectors and the SPs. “The SEC had declared that it is postponing the elections keeping in view public safety due to coronavirus. The same SEC has instructed the government to transfer the collectors and SPs. There is no logic in the decision,” said Nani.Meanwhile, Guntur collector Samuel Anand Kumar kept himself away from attending official programmes on Monday.

356,['17/03/2020'],Woman attempts suicide at police commissionerate,"Aurangabad: A 40-year-old woman tried to commit suicide by consuming a poisonous substance inside the police commissionerate to protest against inaction by Waluj police against the suspects who allegedly molested her and assaulted her son.

The woman was rushed to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and is said to be out of danger.

Following the incident, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Meena Makwana said while she was talking to a delegation, the woman suddenly came forward and tried consuming a poisonous substance.

“Policemen present at the spot intervened and prevented her from consuming the entire bottle that contained pesticide. Her condition is stable now and she is out of danger,” she said.

As per preliminary investigation, the woman’s son was assaulted by four to five people on March 10 when he was playing holi in Dahegaon village of Gangapur tehsil — falling under the limits of Waluj police station.

After being assaulted, the boy rushed home and was narrating the incident to her mother when the suspects barged into their house and started assaulting him again. Later, based on a complaint lodged by the woman, the suspects were booked by police.

The woman, however, alleged that the police were not arresting the suspects despite regular follow-ups with the investigation officer.

After her frequent pleas fell on deaf ears, the woman on Monday reached out to the commissioner of police’s office. The top-cop was not present in the office as he was busy with the on-going interviews of competitive exams.

Those reaching the CP office were diverted to the chambers of DCP headquarters, where the woman tried to end her life. Makwana clarified that police had initiated action against the suspects on Monday morning itself.

At the time of going to the press, no decision was taken to register an offence against the woman.

The Congress workers have made a representation to the waqf and minorities development minister pointing out that out of the 92,000-acre waqf properties in the state over 58,000-acre are located in Marathwada.

Speaking to reporters on Monday Congress city unit working president Mohsin Ahmed said Aurangabad is the central point of Maharashtra and public at large visit the head office of the waqf board for resolving their queries.

“We have come to know that some members of the board have passed a resolution to shift the head office to Mumbai, but MM Shaikh, chairman of Maharashtra State Board of Waqfs, has opposed this proposal,” he said.

“Shifting the office to Mumbai will put thousands of waqf caretakers to tremendous inconvenience. The motive behind shifting the Waqf board head office was also not clear or logical, when over 58,000-acre properties are situated in Marathwada alone,” he added.

Ahmed demanded the state government to issue a direction under section 97 of the Waqf Act, 1995, to keep head office of the waqf board in Aurangabad for the convenience of the people at large.

CHENNAI: Is there a Tamil equivalent of ‘netizen’, ‘hotspot’ or ‘groupfie’? The answer would have been no until a year ago. But a Tamil Nadu government project to create a word bank now has an appropriate translation for these words .

To ensure the classical language of Tamil does not get diluted and keeps growing, the Tamil Etymological Dictionary Project launched ""sorkuvai""’ (word corpus) a year ago. While the government has been allocating `1 crore a year to build the bank, it’s only over the past year that as many as 16,000 Tamil words from domains such as medicine, engineering, law, science and technology, have been coined and added to the corpus.

The officials at the AP assembly said that the four nominations representing YSRC and one nomination from TDP were found valid as per the records.

Ministers Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose and Mopidevi Venkata Ramana, industrialists Alla Ayodhya Rami Reddy and Parimal Nathwani have filed the nominations from YSRC while Varla Ramaiah filed the nomination on behalf of TDP.

As the assembly has to elect four members this time, with five candidates in the fray voting is likely to be required if there are no withdrawals before March 18. Polling will be held on March 26.

Though TDP has no strength in the assembly to get its candidate elected, the party fielded the candidate as political strategy. TDP has 23 members, including its president Chandrababu Naidu while its candidate requires 44 votes to win. TDP’s decision to filed its candidate has only increased the tension in the ruling party to ensure all its four candidates are elected.

With absolute majority in the House to win all the four seats, YSRC has to play its cards close chest to avoid any discrepancy in voting.

The party would have to distribute all its 151 members equally for its four candidates giving them their first preference votes.

361,['17/03/2020'],"Chennai: From overweight to podium finish, a race to remember","Representative image

CHENNAI: Two decades ago, Idris Mohammed was a regular bloke, focusing only on the sales graph of his company, hardly bothered about his unhealthy routine. Until one day he realised the active child in him had turned into an overweight middle-aged man.

When Idris began his journey to get fit, on the first day he progressed a princely 150 metres before stopping because he was ran out of breath. Now 52, the Tamil Nadu born man earns about Rs50,000 every time he finishes on the podium . A semi-professional runner , with a consistent speed and endurance, Idris has been able to put food on the table for his family.

Recently, Idris ran the IDBI New Delhi 42.2km marathon and clocked a stunning 3 hours and 3 minutes. But becoming this fast and this good took time for Idris. From 150 metres he progressed to walking for the next six months, before moving to 5km runs. It did not take long for Idris to get into shape and start winning those 5km races. Soon after Idris, who was then based out of Bahrain, was tempted to run in a 21km half marathon. Disregarding the advice of his boss to stay off races of such lengths, Idris was adamant and put in a 10km run as the only practice run for the half marathon. ""I spent the next five days recovering from the 10km run,"" says Idris. Surprisingly, when race day arrived, Idris clocked an impressive 1.43 minutes for the 21km distance. ""I knew I had the speed and that I should concentrate on running,"" says Idris.

Two years later, Idris ran his first marathon and in his second marathon, he emerged a winner. That victory was no fluke as he went on to win the event the next two years as well. But at home it was not quite a smooth ride. ""My mother could not understand why I was running so much and sternly asked me to stick to my job. My wife was initially apprehensive and wondered what was behind my passion for running,"" says Idris.

His passion reached new heights when Idris quit his job, shifted base to Chennai in 2014 and became a full-time runner, finishing on podiums almost every weekend to win prize money. The running culture in the city has been growing in the past few years with participants across age-groups taking to marathons and notching up the competition by roping in coaches to train.

Apart from being a marathoner, Idris is now also a coach with Asics. After so many years, his wife has finally reconciled to the fact that her husband has not done badly for himself. ""So much so that, she has realised the value of health and goes out for a walk.""

For a man who lives between one podium finish to another on weekends, it is not such a bad life after all, especially if his legs allow him to earn a

living.

According to the prosecution, the couple got married in February 2018 but there were constant fights between the two. It was alleged that the man was being harassed and his wife and her mother, who would blame his mother for stealing household articles. It was alleged he ended his life as he could not bear the harassment and left behind a suicide note blaming them.

The five, apprehending arrest in the case of suicide abetment and criminal intimidation registered against them with the Songir police station in Dhule district, had approached the HC and were granted interim bail on January 28, 2020.

Their plea for confirmation of interim bail came up for hearing before Justice Mangesh S Patil on March 13.

Lawyer Jodyeep Chatterji represented the wife of the deceased, her mother, both Dhule residents, and the deceased’s maternal uncle, a Nandurbar resident. Lawyers A G Girase and Yogesh Bolkar represented the woman’s sister and her husband, residents of Dhule.

They argued that since there was a matrimonial dispute, the woman has served her husband with a notice in November 2019 putting forth her version and the reasons for the matrimonial dispute. The suicide took place later in a month or so. “If such is the state of affairs, the applicants cannot be attributed with knowledge or intention to abet suicide,” they said.

While confirming the bail, Justice Patil observed “It is a matter of record that there is a suicide note wherein the deceased has attributed the behaviour of his wife and mother-in-law primarily as the cause which subjected him to stress. But then, it would be a matter of perception of an individual. It appears from the record that the cause of the behaviour of the wife and mother-in-law is only one amongst several other factors which cumulatively seems to have led to the stress.’’

COIMBATORE: For close to a decade , 55-year-old Mani has been selling banana in a pushcart opposite Panneerselvam flower market on the Mettupalayam Road in the central zone of the city. He has been buying fruits from farmers in and around Mettupalayam and spending hundreds of rupees every day to transport the produce. Whether he sells it or not, he had to pay a sum of Rs 50 every time he starts the business.

“Even though we are not doing business inside the market, we have been paying the amount to the contractors of the flower market for years now. We were told that it was collected as per the norms and nobody dares to question them,” he said.

A street vendor, Murugamma, who is a resident of Alandurai said that she has been selling Tulsi leaves from roadside for close to 30 years. “Even after spending two to three days inside the forest, we can collect only five to six bundles of Tulsi leaves, with bundle selling at Rs 50. Even if the amount we earn through sales is minimal and the place where we sell it is far from flower market. We would be paying Rs 10 to contractors,” she said.

“”The amount that we pay might vary from a vendor to vendor. But the situation is almost the same for all vendors who sell flowers or fruits till Shanmuga theatre which is about half a kilometre away from the market.

According to an RTI reply from the corporation, permission was given to collect toll from all vendors who sell flowers inside Panneeerselvam flower market but to collect toll from those who sell tiffin and fruits.

P Mani, district president of Coimbatore street vendors association said, “The contractors have been exploiting sellers including women to collect the amount. It varies from vendor to vendor and season to season. During the festival seasons, they demand close to Rs 100 from each vendor.”

“How fair it is to demand money from the street vendors who have been selling goods on the road without having enough money to put up a shop? The money that we earn is hardly sufficient for us,” he said.

Refusing the allegations, KK Ayyappan , trustee of Kovai district flower merchant association said, “Corporation has given us permission to collect toll from the vendors who sell flowers inside the market and the vendors are selling on roadside only due to a lack of space inside the flower market.

“The vendors would have put up a stall inside the market if there would have been the space and that is why we have been collecting toll from them.”

A corporation source said, “Vendors are not authorized to sell it on roadsides as it causes hindrance to traffic. When the vendors itself are not authorized, how could the contractors collect toll from them. It is illegal.”

The civic body has become aggressive after state government directives and fined 31 persons spitting in the open in the city. A fine of Rs 8,100 was also collected from the erring citizens. While a fine of Rs 500 was fixed by the state government for the nuisance, the actual amount was low as many who were spotted spitting did not have sufficient money.

As a part of the awareness drive, VMC will be putting up hoardings, banners and posters across the city. Officials said that stress will be laid on reaching out to people visiting places like busy market places, bus stands, using city and state transport buses as well as gardens.

All LED screens put up by the civic body at junctions in the city will have messages on prevention of COVID-19. Officials said that other means of creating awareness were also being adopted including the use of mass media.

Officials of the civic body are still getting lists of passengers from affected countries who have landed in India. “We are scrutinizing these and reaching out to the citizens who are within the Vadodara limits,” said an official. Incomplete and vague addresses in these lists have, however, become a routine affair and officials are forced to make calls to such persons to ascertain their locations.

UDHAGAMANDALAM: An international school in Ooty has informed parents of students in Class IX and below based outside of India to make preparations for their children to return to them as soon as possible so as not to be caught by border control restrictions.

If the wards do return home, the school would expect them to remain with the parents until border restrictions are lifted, a letter from the Hebron School said. “We are particularly concerned about the well-being of younger students who look forward to seeing parents at the mid-semester break. If they remain at school, there is a risk of having to wait until the June holidays to see parents. If the restrictions continue, students may not be free to return home even at that stage,” it said.

The school will close on June 14 and remain closed over the June - August break. It will be up to the parents to make alternative arrangements for the student who is unable to return to their home country at that time due to border closures, as the school will be unable to take responsibility beyond the end of the term, the letter added.

The association estimates that around 1.5 lakh street vendors will be hit.In Old Delhi, vendors of the now relocated Daryaganj Sunday book bazaar are equally perplexed. Ashrafilal Verma, vice-president of NASVI, said their biggest sales occur in March as the academic session starts from April 1. “The livelihood of more than 275 vendors is at stake. We have already collected the books from suppliers. What will we do now?” he remarked, seeking some relaxation from the government.Ashok Kumar, who sells children’s clothes in the Friday market near St Thomas Church in RK Puram, said the weekly market gives him the biggest earnings. “I earn a bulk of my monthly income on these four days. My family will now have to survive on savings this month,” he added.NASVI national coordinator Arbind Singh said the closure should have been carried out in a phased manner. “Daily wagers and vendors are the most impacted due to the slowdown triggered by Covid-19. This order will further worsen the economic condition of thousands of families. An alternative should have been made for the livelihood of the vendors,” he added.Known by the days on which they are held — Budh, Shukr, Shani bazaar — these weekly markets come up at fixed times in specific localities attracting large crowds, most visitors being from middle and lower income groups. From essential grains to fruits and vegetables, street food, clothes and home merchandise, the “hafta bazaars” trade in items as per the demography and demands of the localities.A senior municipal corporation official said that the large numbers of visitors is precisely why the markets need to be suspended for preventing further transmission of Covid-19.“Initially, we were of the opinion that weekly bazaars trading in essential items like foodgrains, spices, vegetables, etc shouldn’t be shut because it might lead to scarcity of items and panic in the general public. However, now that Delhi government has issued the order, we will enforce it with the help of market pradhans,” added the official.A few of the major weekly markets are held at Mohammadpur on Friday, Sector 6 RK Puram, Razapur and Majnu ka Tila on Sunday, Mandawali on Thursday, Bhogal on Tuesday, Sector 13 Rohini and opposite Fortis Hospital in Vasant Kunj on Saturday, and Govindpuri on Wednesday.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74684447,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-664167,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1-5l-vendors-to-be-hit-by-closure-of-weekly-mkts/articleshow/74681598.cms

379,['17/03/2020'],Covid-19 Impact: US Cos may require additional compliance to cover H-1B employees in their work from home policies,"Mumbai: The ‘ work from home ’ policy takes on a new dimension, if you are an H-1B worker in the US. Companies are seeking clarifications from attorneys on how H-1B workers can be accommodated in their ‘work from home’ policy. It may require additional documentation to be filed with the concerned authorities and an additional expense.There are other aspects that are worrying the Indian diaspora . As has been done across many countries, the US Consulate offices in India have cancelled immigrant and non-immigrant visa appointments (which covers H-1B visas) from March 16, till further notice. Once operations resume, appointments can be rescheduled. Individuals have been asked to look up the embassy website to keep abreast of developments.The number of Indians in the US on H-1B visas is significant and runs into several lakhs. To illustrate: Country-wise data of H-1B visas allotted is available for fiscal 2017, during which 2.76 lakh H-1B visas (both for initial employment and visa extensions) or 75% of the total went to those born in India. Approximately, Indians are allotted 60% of the 85,000 H-1B cap visas that are issued annually.A change in the work location, (say to the H-1B holder’s place of residence) is a material change under the immigration regulations. Speaking to TOI, New York based immigration attorney, Cyrus D Mehta said, “If workers work from home, and within commuting distance of their workplace, there should be no need to file an amendment of their H-1B petition. On the other hand, if the workers telecommute will be from a location outside the commuting distance from the workplace, and this was not contemplated in the original H-1B petition, then an amendment relating to the new work location should be filed.” Even in case of work from home, H-1B workers must be paid the required wage and must be performing duties related to the H-1B position, he added.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group dived into the legal technicalities, “A change in location of the H-1B employee’s place of employment to a geographical area not covered in the original Labour Condition Application (LCA) is a material change affecting eligibility under H-1B. For example, if an H-1B employee is under ‘self-quarantine’ or working remotely from home, but his or her residence is outside the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) of employment, a new LCA would be required to be filed and posted. Further, a new or amendment H-1B petition would have to be filed, not to mention there may be a prevailing wage difference. Staying within the same geographical area means the area within normal commuting distance of the place of employment or within the same MSA.”“There is also a limited, but flexible 30-60 day short term placement option granted by the US Department of Labour, which allows H-1B employers to assign their employees to job sites not previously contemplated or listed in the LCA, subject to certain additional criteria,” added Ashwin Sharma, an immigration attorney based in Jacksonville.According to Sharma most employers are likely to file an H-1B amendment if the existing LCA doesn't already cover the H-1B worker's home as a job site, as the short-term placement option is fairly limited in scope.“An H-1B amendment comes with costs attached – of $460 plus legal fees. However, it can be filed very quickly, and upon filing the H-1B worker can commence work from home,” Sharma stated.Batra also pointed out that leave under the ‘Family and Medical Leave Act’, does not terminate the H-1B relationship with the employer, and the latter will be liable for paying the employee.Arlington based Rajiv S. Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com summed up, “Most offices in major metropolitan areas are either allowing or requiring everyone to work from home. Normally, H-1B workers are permitted to only work from the location for which their H-1B has been approved. Under the circumstances, I do not see any issue with H-1B employees working from whichever location they are isolated in. Technically, the government can claim that certain places were not preapproved for H-1B employment. But there is an overarching public concern here that must be accommodated by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and allied regulatory agencies.”“However, if H-1B workers get terminated because their employers can no longer afford them, this will result in them being out of status after the 60-day grace period. If employers furlough H-1B workers, they must still pay them the required wage pursuant to the H-1B petition” Mehta said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74682562,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-675888,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-19-impact-us-cos-may-require-additional-compliance-to-cover-h-1b-employees-in-their-work-from-home-policies/articleshow/74664240.cms

VADODARA: A nine-year-old girl living in Makarpura was allegedly molested by a sweet shop owner near her home on Monday morning.

According to police, the girl went to Bhawani Sweets and Caterers shop on Monday around noon to buy samosas for herself. The owner of the shop Shivram Singh Faujdar called the girl near a refrigerator in the corner of his shop and touched her inappropriately. As the girl started crying, 45-year-old Faujdar let her go but warned her of consequences if she told anyone about the act. Police said that Faujdar was alone at his shop when the girl went so he took advantage of the situation.

On reaching back home, the girl narrated the incident to her parents. The girl’s father, who is a civil contractor, and her uncle went to confront Faujdar. However, instead of admitting and being apologetic, Faujdar hurled abuses at the duo and threaten to kill them if they will again come to his shop.

The girl’s family members then went to Makarpura police station where an offence of sexual harassment, using obscene words, criminal intimidation and violation of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was registered. Faujdar was picked up by police from his shop on Monday evening for interrogation.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

This comes even as the government reportedly plans to adopt an aggressive strategy to test random samples of people, who display flu-like symptoms but have no travel history to outbreak zones, in order to prevent community transmission.At present, India imports diagnostic testing kits from Germany and Switzerland, while the testing is handled by 52 Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) laboratories across the country.Right now India has approved only rapid RT PCR kits for accurate and confirmatory testing, with Thermo Fisher and Roche supplying these kits globally. Trivitron plans to launch indigenously-manufactured RT PCR kits. Dr GSK Velu, chairman and managing director, told TOI that Trivitron is waiting for approvals from National Institute of Virology for validation protocols and positive samples.“The kits by our JV company in China, Labsystems Diagnostics Shandong, are approved and sold there. China and we are planning to use that expertise and compone-nts to make them in India. The costs are still being worked out. We have allocated Rs 4 to 5 crore emergency funds to upgrade our R&D infrastructure for launching hand sanitizers and Covid-19 kits,” he added.There is a debate on whether countries should follow the South Korea model of wide-scale testing, which is believed to be successful in containing the outbreak. At present, India will not go the South Korea way reportedly but may revise its strategy if the situation arises.Though the government is not in favour of private testingof Covid-19 at present, the situation may change later with private diagnostic chains being roped in. Ameera Shah, promoter and MD, Metropolis Healthcare said the company has been selected by the Mumbai civic chief for Covid-19 testing. “We are waiting for the formal notification from ministry of health to start private testing.

385,['17/03/2020'],Kolkata: Ritwik grand niece stakes claim to works,"Representative image

KOLKATA: Who owns the film rights of Ritwik Ghatak now? On Sunday, documentary photographer and author of ‘Life after Ritwik Ghatak’ Nabarupa Bhattacharjee posted on FB that she is the new settlor of the Ritwik Memorial Trust, which owns the rights of films and unfinished works of the filmmaker. According to her, these rights were legally transferred to her in 2017 by Ghatak’s wife, Surama.

The post generated reactions from various quarters, including Ghatak’s niece Aroma Dutta who is a parliamentarian in Bangladesh. After the demise of Surama in 2018, questions surfaced regarding the right owner of the legendary maker’s films, scripts and personal collections. Ghatak’s two daughters had passed away earlier. Ritaban had not been keeping well for some time now. Explaining her relationship with the Ghataks, Bhattacharjee told TOI, “Surama Ghatak was the younger sister of my grandmother, Kanaklata Bhattacharjee. My grandfather, Nipendranath Bhattacharjee , and author Bijan Bhattacharjee were cousins.” While working on the book, Nabarupa claims to have noticed that Surama was “worried” about who will take care of her belongings and continue with the work of the Trust. “Surama thamma, I feel, has always been misunderstood. Through the book, we brought out her side of the story. That touched her deeply. Out of love, she took this decision to include my name as the settlor of the trust,” she said.

Speaking to TOI from Dhaka, Dutta said, “Ritwik Ghatak belongs to the entire world. This property can’t belong to any individual. The Ritwik Ghatak Memorial Trust should be taken up by the state government of Bengal and Films Division of India . To my utter surprise, this lady claims ownership of the Trust. Neither does she belong to the Ghatak family, nor is she from the film fraternity. I have also spoken to my relatives and members from the film fraternity on this issue. Justice needs to be done.”

Meanwhile, Bhattacharjee said, “The right is with the trust of which Ritaban kaka is a trustee and I am the settlor. The royalty now belongs to Ritaban Ghatak and me. But because of Ritaban kaka’s health issues, I have added a new beneficiary to the trust. He is my father, Nabarun Bhattacharjee. He is the chairman of the Jupitar Group of Industries . Ritaban kaka no longer participates in any work related to the Trust.” Going by her views, any organisation that wants to buy the rights of Ghatak’s films or restore them has to get in touch with her for consent.

“I will be making important decisions once and when I join the dots of the Trust’s past commitments. I will be forming a new trust/foundation under the mother trust. The personal belongings of Ghatak is being catalogued and conserved and will come out in the public domain in some time.”

Already reeling under a shortage of doctors and paramedic staff, the council of ministers decided to give a six-month extension in service to staff members who were to retire after attaining the age of 58 years on March 31.

The state government had recently abolished the provision of granting two-year extension in service.

Medical colleges have been kept open as a support system.

The cabinet decided that MBBS students who were not employed should be contacted and asked by the department to stand by on voluntary basis.

Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh directed that private and state-run buses must carry hand sanitisers for the use of passengers to ensure hygiene and secure travellers.

The cabinet passed a resolution appealing people to avoid going to crowded places and mass gatherings, to maintain hand and respiratory hygiene, and to ensure cleanliness of their surroundings. People were also advised to wash hands frequently with soap and water or hand sanitisers, and they should avoid touching their face, said an official after the meeting. The CM urged people not to panic and take all precautions, while avoiding crowded places and mass gatherings.

People have been advised to avoid non-essential travel, said the resolution. It said people who are having cough, sneezing and fever should immediately contact 104 (medical helpline of the health department) or controlrooms of their respective district.

The CM asked all ministers to monitor the situation and ensure implementation of curbs in their districts, in close coordination with administration. He urged them to hold regular meetings with the local administration to maintain visibility in districts and boost the confidence of people.

Of the 2,297 samples sent for testing, 1,693 tested negative.The chief minister declared holidays for MBBS students till March 31. But, postgraduates and house surgeons will be working in all hospitals. The government has sought Centre’s support to shift students from Kerala who are studying in other states.To avoid overcrowding at airports because of screening process, the government has sought the support of Airports Authority of India to begin more immigration centres and health desks at airports. The customs department has also been contacted to increase counters to avoid overcrowding.Vijayan said screening at domestic airports have been strengthened. More vehicles have been deployed at airports to shift passengers with suspect symptoms. He urged all places of worship to avoid gatherings and postpone events like marriages. Despite several directives from health department, Vijayan said there were reports it was not being properly followed at many places.The chief minister urged Keralites to respect foreigners who are living in the state now. He said they should be properly guided about the precautions “we have taken or else they should be directed to the respective health or district administration authorities”. He said there is no plan to close bars and liquor outlets and enough pracautionary measures would be made to avoid crowding in these places.Vijayan also said that state-level bankers committee meet will be convened soon to probe the possibility for declaring a moratorium on bank loans ‘to rescue Covid 19-hit trade and industries like commerce and tourism’. The decision was taken at the all-party meeting to assess the Covid-19 situation in state.“The panic surrounding Covid-19 has caused a severe social impact, affecting small and medium scale merchants and traders. Tourism industry has been badly hit and economic situation is likely to worsen in coming days, which calls for such measures as a relief,” he said.Earlier, stakeholders in tourism like KTM (Kerala Travel Mart) Society had urged him to advise banks and financial institutions to announce moratorium on repayment of loans and interests from entrepreneurs in the tourism sector for one year.Though opposition alleged that that there were several lapses on the part of the government, it extended total support to government’s initiatives to fight the virus. “It’s heartening to have the support of opposition parties and this unity will be strengthened at the local-level to fight the pandemic,” said Vijayan.Among the recommendations put forth were provisions for soap and sanitizers at public places like bus stands and participation of youth organizations in activities like blood donation and awareness campaigns.

COIMBATORE: Residents of Kumarasamy Nagar who are staying on the encroached lands near the water bodies on Sundapalayam Road and Thadagam Road on Monday staged a protest demanding patta for the land or alternate land near the locality.

The city corporation and the Tamil Nadu slum clearance board (TNSCB) have been planning to relocate them for the last several years in order to protect the water bodies.

As many as 1,800 families are staying along Muthanankulam, Krishnampathy lake, Narasampathy lake and Selvampathy lake, a TNSCB official said. “Most of them have agreed to vacate their houses after obtaining tokens for alternative accommodation at our housing units in Kovaipudur and Malumichampatti,” he said.

The resident had decided to stage the protest along with the cadres of DMK, AIADMK, CPI, CPM and CPI(ML) after corporation and TNSCB officials visited the locality a few days ago to identify the number of houses that were vacated.

Some families had accepted the tokens and moved to the housing unit, said Velmurugan , a resident. “But they returned due to lack of basic amenities including transportation, hospitals, educational institutions as well as employment opportunities there,” he told TOI.

“Those who returned are demanding alternative accommodations in the city limit where they will have access to basic amenities. Those who refused to accept the tokens are demanding alternate land.”

Authorities should give them the vacant government land near Veerakeralam and near the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University , Velmurugan said.

Police detained as many as 200 protesters as the protest was staged without permission.

According to the police, on Sunday evening, Shubham Meshram, 25, and his brother Tejas, 17, were heading home on a bike when they spotted several people standing on a road near Kamgar Nagar.

Bhopal: The Kamal Nath government on Monday dodged a floor test when Speaker N P Prajapati adjourned the assembly till March 26 in view of the Coronavirus threat. The House will now reconvene on the day of Rajya Sabha election.

BJP promptly moved Supreme Court, seeking disqualification of the Congress government for “ignoring the Governor’s instruction to conduct a floor test”, and paraded its 106 MLAs at Raj Bhawan. Soon after this, Governor Lalji Tandon wrote to CM Nath, asking him to hold the floor test on March 17. “Otherwise, it will be considered that you don’t have majority,” the Governor warned.

After receiving the letter, Nath called a meeting of top Congress leaders and ministers and then left for Raj Bhawan. After meeting the Governor, the CM said: “I discussed the present political scenario in the state with the Governor and thanked him for his address to the House.”

Asked about the Governor’s letter for floor test on Tuesday, the CM said: “Why should I go for floor test? There is a provision that the Opposition can ask for no-confidence motion. Let them do the floor-test if they want. They (BJP) asked for a no-confidence motion today. And what about the 16 MLAs who have been confined by BJP? Let them come before the media and the House.”

The CM reiterated that his government is in majority. Supreme Court will on Tuesday hear former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s petition, seeking “immediate floor test to avoid horse-trading”. Suspense persists on the rebel Congress MLAs in Bengaluru.

The action-packed day began with the assembly convening at 11am. The Coronavirus divide was clear. Most Congress MLAs — including CM Nath — were seen wearing masks. BJP legislators didn’t.

Soon after the Governor’s two-minute address, perhaps the briefest ever in MP’s legislative history, Tandon gave a message to the House: “I want to give legislators some advice. With the present situation in the state, peacefully and with dedication, ensure that the rules of the Constitution and democratic traditions of Madhya Pradesh are upheld and protected.”

Leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava stood up to speak but ruckus ensued immediately. Congress MLAs shouted, “Respect what the Governor said just now.”

Bhargava demanded a floor test, claiming that the Nath government is in minority after the resignation of 22 MLAs. Speaker N P Prajapati told the LOP, “Please sit down. Whatever letters (including resignations of MLAs) have been exchanged were with the Governor. Not in the assembly or with Speaker.” As Bhargava tried to argue, fresh uproar started and Speaker adjourned the House for 10 minutes.

After the House reconvened, Bhargava and Chouhan reiterated that the government “is in minority”. Amid noisy scenes, the Speaker announced adjournment of the House till March 26, citing a Government of India advisory to avoid large gatherings in view of the Covid-19 threat.

The BJP MLAs then headed for Raj Bhavan. “We are here to submit a list of 106 BJP MLAs to the Governor and tell him that the Congress government is in minority,” Bhargava said. Chouhan said, “Congress has run away from the battlefield. This government does not have the Constitutional status to be in power. Even Coronavirus cannot save them. We are approaching Supreme Court.”

Soon after the BJP MLAs left, Tandon wrote to CM Nath to conduct a floor test on Tuesday. “I received your reply to my letter, dated March 14, 2020. Thank you. I am sorry that the language and spirit of the letter is not according to Parliamentary traditions… I am sorry to say that instead of conducting a floor test within the stipulated time frame set by me, you tried to delay the floor test which has no basis and significance. I again request you to conduct the floor test on March 17 and prove your majority, or else it will be considered that you don’t have majority in the House,” the letter said.

This letter apparently stopped a BJP bid to move its MLAs to Gurugram again. With another floor-test date ahead, BJP plans to bring the 22 rebel Congress MLAs from Bengaluru, say sources. BJP leaders Arvind Bhadoria and Ramakant Bhargava left for Bengaluru in the evening, said sources.

State Congress president Girish Chodankar , in a written complaint to the SEC, said Sawant’s directions were “contrary to the Constitutional framework” and in violation of the model code of conduct.

In its response, SEC clarified that it would process requests for public meetings based on safety measures taken by political parties.

“The chief minister cannot issue a diktat prohibiting or permitting meetings in relation to ZP elections. This can only be done upon the SEC’s directions,” Chodankar said. He also questioned how Sawant could address a public gathering and campaign for the elections after himself issuing directives not to conduct public meetings.

Goa SEC member secretary Melvyn Vaz said that permission for political parties or candidates to hold public meetings will be granted as per provisions contained in the model code of conduct.

The President’s assent is shortly expected, but this will have to be followed by notification and issue of the forms, rules and procedures.Added to that is outbreak of the Cornoa virus, which for multinationals could entail a delay in obtaining the requisite green signal from overseas headquarters. Covid-19 has also resulted in an economic slowdown, and several taxpayers are facing a cash-crunch.Government sources say that they are prepared for speedy execution of the scheme once the Presidential assent is obtained. However given the turmoil caused by Covid-19, a group of six professional and trade associations, that include the IMC Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Bombay Chartered Accountants’ Society and associations of chartered accountants in Karnataka, Ahmedabad, Surat and Lucknow have made a joint representation to the Ministry of Finance for extension of time-line of 31st March 2020 for payment of 100% of disputed tax under VSVS.Under the scheme, taxpayers can settle disputes by paying due Income-tax with complete waiver of interest and penalty till March 31 and with some additional payment till June 30.The joint representation points out that several issues have been raised by stake-holders post introduction of the revised Bill by the government and FAQs issued by Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). Clarifications to these issues are awaited. Also, once rules and procedures are notified, there could be certain issues which will require clarifications for smooth implementation and functioning of the Scheme.As things stand, to avail of the scheme under payment of 100% of disputed tax, taxpayers will have only around 8-10 days to make an application, get it processed by the designated authority (DA) and make payment before March end.The procedure prescribed under VSVS itself provides 15 days for the DA to issue a certificate and thereafter another 15 days for the taxpayers to make payment. Hence the need for an extension, explains the representation.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vivad-se-vishwas-scheme-an-extension-beyond-march-end-will-help-say-tax-experts/articleshow/74664252.cms

VADODARA: The cop , who was arrested for allegedly raping a 21-year-old girl, was suspended by city police commissioner Anupam Singh Gahlaut on Monday.

The top cop also shunted police inspector N K Vyas of Laxmipura police station in whose jurisdiction the rape accused cop Surajsinh Chauhan was posted.

“Chauhan has been suspended and the driver who was accompanying him in the police control room (PCR) van too has been removed,” Gahlaut told TOI. When asked if Vyas was transferred as he didn’t act swiftly in the rape complaint, Gahlaut denied it and said that it was a routine transfer. Vyas has now been posted with cybercrime cell.

Sources, however, said that Vyas wasn’t performing his duty efficiently since months. “He used to disappear from duty often for the court dates in Saurashtra where he was earlier posted. He also took long leaves for attending personal functions. It was as if Laxmipura police station was working without a full time police inspector,” a senior police official said.

“He had little hold over the staff working under him. So Vyas has been shunted out and the police station will get a new police inspector from Tuesday,” the official added.

Singh met the returning officer of Rajya Sabha elections Avdhesh Pratap Singh on Monday and submitted a written complaint, alleging that Scindia has not mentioned FIRs registered against him in the affidavit and nomination papers.

A similar complaint was submitted by Congress’ second Rajya Sabha candidate, Phool Singh Baraiya, against Dr Sumer Singh who was allegedly a government employee on the day he filed nomination papers.

State Congress spokesman and legal cell chief JP Dhanopia said, “In Madhya Pradesh, there are three seats for Rajya Sabha. Congress candidates are Digvijaya Singh and Phool Singh Baraiya. For BJP, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Dr Sumer Singh have filed their nominations. Scrutiny of nominations was being done today and Congress raised objections on the forms submitted by Scindia and Dr Singh.”

Scindia’s nomination form has “many irregularities”, Dhanopia said, adding: “Digvijaya Singh has given a written complaint that there are many legal proceedings and FIRs that have not been mentioned by Scindia in the affidavit and the nominations.”

Baraiya’s complaint says that BJP’s Singh, who was a government employee, resigned on March 12 and it was accepted on March 14. “This means that when he filed his nomination on March 13, he was still a government employee. This is against the rules for nomination to Rajya Sabha,” he added.

Speaking to TOI, Rajya Sabha election returning officer Avdhesh Pratap Singh said, “Representatives of Digvijaya Singh and Phool Singh Baraiya filed objections, copies of which we have forwarded to representatives of those against whom complaints have been made. Replies should be here by 11am on Tuesday after which we will go through the documents and take a decision.”

Digvijaya met Governor Lalji Tandon around noon on Monday. “There was no political discussion, just a courtesy call. I have very old relations with the Governor,” he said. Digvijaya left just before BJP MLAs entered Raj Bhavan to parade 106 MLAs before the Governor.

She further alleged that Solanki, the Congress nominee for the RS election, then used this to pressure the Congress leadership into giving him the RS ticket.

Stating that she received a phone call from Solanki eight days ago, Kokila on Monday said, “Bharatsinh called me and informed that Shaktisinh Gohil and Madhusudan Mistry were finalized as the candidates for the RS election. When I insisted that a Patidar be nominated, he said I should convince J V Kakadiya to quit.” She added, “Bharatsinh Solanki then pressurized the Congress leadership to nominate him, or he would quit with Congress MLAs.”

TOI visited many public toilets in the different areas of the city and found several places that did not have handwash or soaps.

Manoj Meena, a worker at a public toilet near World Trade Park, said authorities were not providing soaps in the toilets. “This is a small toilet. Though it is being cleaned everyday, no arrangements have been made for soaps,” Manoj said.

Meerut Municipal Corporation has installed water tankers containing chlorine in various areas of the city for the purpose of washing hands only in a bid to combat coronavirus. Many state authorities in the country are providing hand sanitisers in the toilets as well.

A JMC official said they provide handwash in every toilet. “We do provide handwash in every public toilet and in case it was missing in a few of them, it would be provided,” said the official.

Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) launched Smart Toilets in the city a few months ago where hand dryers, sanitary pad vending machines and incinerator was installed. At a smart toilet at Jhalana Doongri, there was no facility for handwash. One smart toilet in Atish Market was out of handwash.

“JMC was supposed to install the handwash box here when the toilet was converted into a smart toilet but then they did not. We have asked them to do that as lot of people visit the toilets due to the presence of many government offices in the area but they haven’t done it yet,” said Santosh, a worker at the toilet.

COIMBATORE: The ban on autorickshaw rides after 10pm in view of the CAA protests has hit their business, the autorickshaw Workers Union said in a petition to the collector on Monday.

As several autorickshaw drivers depend only on the night rides from railway stations and bus stands, such a ban would affect them as well as the passengers, president of the union C Sukumar said. “Some of us prefer to operate at night as there is less competition and because they can make some extra money. Night time is the main business hour for those who park in bus stands and in front of railway stations. If you bar them from operating in those hours, their livelihood would be affected.” “Why should we pay the price if some groups clash somewhere else in the city?”

The globally patented technology was invented by Sanjeev Swamy, a PIO in Switzerland.Each mask, priced around Rs 1000, is washable up to 30 times, and reusable up to 200 days. It also blocks polluted air.The company provides the patented fabric, which has been processed and treated to make it a disinfectant, to subcontractors which manufacture masks in India. Globally, it has manufacturing units in Jordan and Sri Lanka from where it supplies to Asia and Middle-East, with orders at present of around 10 million masks.

JAIPUR: The light-and-sound show at Amber Fort has been cancelled from Tuesday in the wake of coronavirus. Visitors, however, can still visit the monument.

The foreign tourist footfall to the monument, which remained unaffected till March 14, has now started to decline. On March 14, 826 foreign tourists visited the monument against 1,445 the previous day.

Even though the virus fears spread after an Italian couple tested positive on March 3 and visa suspension was imposed later, that had no immediate impact on visitors to the 16th century monument as footfall ranged between 1,100 and 1,400.

But authorities said the onset of summer and the visa suspension had started impacting the footfall and the foreign tourist numbers could fall further.

As far as domestic tourists was concerned, the numbers had begun declining from 5,749 on March 1 to 3,412 on March 14.

The number of domestic tourists generally decline in March due to exams. And also the summer season has its own impact on the numbers.

With the light-and-sound show being cancelled, the number of visitors are expected to fall further.

In India, the support is available in Malayalam and Hindi apart from English.Santhosh said the project began as a telemedicine platform on the cloud, connecting hospitals under Catholic Health Association of India (CHAI) nearly three weeks ago. But soon IT evolved to embrace hospitals outside the CHAI fold and provide mental health support to general public.Medical professionals looking for specialist advice on Covid-19 can speak to a panel of virologists, pulmonologists and microbiologists through the platform which has embedded audio, video and chat facilities.“People are tensed and living in fear and so they might like to speak to someone.

Raising the issue of the coronavirus outbreak, Congress leader Shailesh Parmar asked for postponement of the ongoing budget session. His proposal was rejected by speaker Rajendra Trivedi, who said that every person who enters the house will be required to sanitize their hands at the entrance. CM Vijay Rupani said, “As of now, there is no need for such an action as there has not been any positive case in the state. As representatives of the public, we should worry about the public and not about ourselves.” Deputy CM Nitin Patel added, “There is no need to panic. All our students from coronavirus affected countries have been brought back.”

Angered by the responses, Congress MLAs shouted slogans and left the assembly. Leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani said the Maharashtra state assembly speaker has also decided to stop the ongoing budget session of Maharashtra. “Other neighbouring states are also contemplating this due to the coronavirus crisis,” he said.

COIMBATORE: Representatives of the Coimbatore District Roadside and Pavement Traders Welfare Association on Monday petitioned the collector, requesting him to allot them a permanent space in the city to set up shops.

Police ask them to vacate the places every time there is a law and order issue, association president P Mani said. “On Friday, policemen told us that we should not do business on the streets on March 14 and 15 due to the CAA protest. Weekend is when business is good. But police often tell us to pack up, without notice,” he said.

Many of the traders buy stocks worth Rs 2,500 to Rs 20,000 depending on the products they sell and the type of business, Mani said. “Some of us can sell the non-perishable goods another day but what about those who sell fruits and vegetables? We actually serve the people by buying fresh fruits and selling them near their houses.”

“Of the 40,000 street vendors in the city, 6,140 have got street vendor cards. But policemen keep harassing us and even demand bribe,” he said.

Street vendors doing business in areas under the Saibaba Colony, R S Puram and Rathinapuri police stations are the most affected.

The collector asked them to meet the Saibaba police station authorities and get a suitable place allotted for them to conduct business, Mani added. TNN

The committee will be chaired by A S Rathod, principal of Dharmendrasinhji Arts College, Rajkot, according to a notification issued by the department on Monday.

The notification said the department received complaints alleging that degrees were sold, following which a preliminary investigation was carried out.

The preliminary findings point to irregularities by the varsity, following which the education department, on January 13, issued a show-cause notice to the varsity.

The varsity authorities approached the high court by filing a petition, seeking 45 days to respond to the government.

“The 45-days period is over and as we have not received a response, the government has decided to form a probe team,” a government official said.

The committee will include M G Bhatt, joint director at the commissionerate of higher education, S G Bhadoriya, principal of Government Arts College, Dhanpur, and Jainik Vakil, an Ahmedabad-based chartered accountant and a member (technical) of the fee regulation committee.

The government received complaints that the university had issued nearly 1,500 PhDs and 800-odd MPhil degrees, to students outside Gujarat, in a very short span of time, sources said.

Complaints against the university included violation of UGC rules such as awarding PhDs in less than three years, passing off internal guides as external guides, taking PhD students without an entrance test and even ‘selling’ doctoral degrees to students from other states.

The University Grants Commission (UGC) had also sought a report from the state government after the show-cause notice was issued.

CHANDIGARH: With the Congress government in Punjab under fire for back-to-back hikes in power tariff, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday announced there was a plan to offer relief to electricity consumers in the state with cheaper tariff.

Addressing media on the achievements of his government on completion of its three years, Amarinder said, “Realising that domestic electricity consumers deserve relief in power tariff, we have decided to rationalise electricity tariff in a manner that reduces their burden, making it more affordable to the common man.”

He, however, added the final details could be given only after the approval of the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC).

Later, answering a question, Amarinder said he could not share details of the proposal and the announcement would be made only after getting a nod from the power regulator. He said a white paper on the state’s power sector would be issued by the Punjab government soon and variable electricity tariff at Rs 5 per unit had been provided to industry.

Opposition parties in the state — Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) — have been criticising the Congress government for not fulfilling its election manifesto promise of renegotiating power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private players. While the AAP has demanded scrapping of PPAs, SAD too has been targeting the Congress government for costly power.

Meanwhile, Amarinder claimed that during the past three years, his government had managed to restrict the tariff hike to 11.5%, despite hike in coal tariff and railway freight charges. He said tariff hike was 23.88% during the previous SAD-BJP government.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday said Amritsar (East) MLA and former cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu was part of the Congress team and his wishes would be considered.

Asked about the current role and status of party MLA Sidhu, Capt Amarinder said the former minister was still a part of the Congress. “We will consider his wishes in taking any decision”. Amarinder said he had known Sidhu since he was two years old and had no personal issues with him.

“Navjot (Sidhu) is a Congressman and today he has made his mind clear that he’s a Congressman. Whatever he wants to do, he’s part of our party, part of our team,” said Amarinder.

To a question about Sidhu meeting the central party leadership on Punjab issues instead of taking it up with the state leadership, the CM said he was welcome to discuss any issue with anyone in the party.

Earlier, Sidhu had resigned from the cabinet following a public spat with Amarinder after Lok Sabha elections. Amarinder had blamed him for party’s poor performance in the urban centres of the state.

‘No review of cabinet for now’

Asked whether he was considering reviewing the council of ministers as his government had completed three years in power, chief minister Amarinder Singh said there was no such plan. After Sidhu’s exit, one cabinet berth has been lying vacant and there have been speculations that the party leadership may go in for a reshuffle. A section of the MLAs, like Amrinder Singh Raja Warring , has also suggested a performance-based review of cabinet ministers.

426,['17/03/2020'],"After Kerala, Rajasthan govt moves top court challenging CAA validity","New Delhi: The Congress government in Rajasthan moved the Supreme Court on Monday challenging the validity of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, saying it is violative of the principle of secularism, which is part of the “basic structure” of the Constitution, and fundamental rights of equality and life.

It became the second state after Kerala to move the top court invoking Article 131 of the Constitution under which a state is empowered to directly move the Supreme Court in case of a dispute with the Centre.

The newly amended law seeks to grant citizenship to migrants belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi communities who came to India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on or before December 31, 2014 due to religious persecution in those countries. It excludes Muslims.

“Pass a judgment and decree that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 is violative of Article 14 (right to equality) and Article 21 (right to life) of the Constitution of India as well as violative of basic structure principle of secularism. Thus Act 47 of 2019 ( CAA ) be declared as void under Article 13 of the Constitution,” said the plea filed through lawyer D K Devesh. Article 13 of the Constitution says any law “inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights” can be held unconstitutional to the extent of its contravention of fundamental rights.

The plea said the CAA be declared “ultra vires” to the provisions of the Constitution of India.

Besides, the plea has stated that the Passport (Entry to India) Amendment Rules, 2015 and Foreigners (Amendment) Order are ultra vires the Constitution and be declared void.

It said the CAA, the amended Passport Rules and the Foreigners Order are class legislations harping on religious identity of an individual, thereby contravening the principles of secularism, which has been recognised by the court as a basic structure of the Constitution.

""The impugned Amendment Act makes 'Religion' and the ‘country of origin’ of the person sole yardstick for grant of citizenship. If a law discriminates an individual on the basis of religion it cannot be termed as a reasonable classification based on an intelligible differentia,” the plea contended, adding it was ""patently erroneous"".

It said the language of the statute conferring benefit on 'illegal immigrants' is not based on persecution alone, but on religion. Therefore, the classification becomes bad in the eye of law, and falls foul of Article 14 of the Constitution.

It said the Statement of Objects and Reasons seems to suggest that the rationale is religious persecution in neighbouring countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

""The impugned law is selective in picking 'Religion' as well as 'countries'. This pick and choose based on irrational criteria of particular religion from a particular place of origin, cannot muster the core principles of equal protection of laws guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution,"" it said.

The plea added that the Act is bereft of any standard principle or norm in discriminating migrants from other countries such as Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bhutan, which are sharing international borders with India and to which and from which there has been trans-border migration.

There is no rationale in not extending the rights conferred to a class of minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, but depriving religious minorities belonging to countries of Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan, it said.

The plea alleged that he Act has resulted in religious based exclusion of Muslims from the benefit of acquiring citizenship through naturalisation, and such exclusionary law contravenes Article 14 of the Constitution. The plea said that the Rajasthan government has opposed the amended Act and the State Legislative Assembly has also passed a resolution on January 25, 2020 for repeal of the amended Act.

Many people were surprised on Monday when district collector Zakir Hussain arrived at collectorate on bicycle.

ADM Ashok Asija and tehsildar Satyanarayana also reached the collectorate on bicycles. Hussain said that under the government’s Nirogi-Rajasthan campaign and in view of the current situation, all the officials were asked to come to their offices on Monday either on bicycle or on foot to spread the message to stay fit. The more we stay fit, the stronger our immune system becomes. And stronger the immune system, less likely are chances of catching coronavirus infection and other diseases.

Taking a cue from the collector, most of the officials either reached the offices on bicycles or on foot. Nirogi-Rajasthan campaign mainly focuses on promotion of preventive measures than help mitigate health problems.

A dedicated website and a call centre are two important components of state-level campaign Nirogi-Rajasthan which was launched on December 17.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday promised total elimination of all kinds of mafia and monopoly in the state.

Promising that he would not allow mining , liquor, drug and transport mafias, or goondas, gangsters and terrorists to disturb the state’s peaceful environment, Amarinder said, “I will be absolutely harsh.”

As an ex-fauji, he knew how to deal with them, said Amarinder at a press conference to mark the completion of three years of his government . He added that everyone would get a free chance to make the most of the opportunities in transport and other sectors.

Vowing to completely eliminate all mafias from the state, Amarinder said his government was working to end all this since taking over Punjab’s reins, “but these things take time.”

“We have done our best, and we could not have done any better considering the situation,” he said, complimenting his cabinet colleagues and officers for the excellent job done by them.

Monopoly in transport

Promising a “massive crackdown” on the Transport mafia, Amarinder said his government would implement, in toto, the high court judgment that was upheld by the Supreme Court and end all permits declared illegal in the state.

He also announced reduction in road tax + cess on ordinary buses from Rs 3.08 to Rs 2.96, as well as special one-time amnesty scheme for settling penal interest on non-payment of government dues by transporters. To a question about monopoly of a single family on buses being operated from Delhi airports to Punjab, the CM said his government was working to address the issue, but the Delhi government also had to be on board with any decision.

Illegal mining

Referring to complaints of continued illegal practices in sand mining, Amarinder said he had asked the water resources minister to thoroughly review and make this system fully transparent. “The government’s aim is to ensure steady supply of sand at affordable rate at the pithead with proper use of technology to check any illegal activity by the contractors or illegal miners,” he said, adding that new mining proposals would be announced by the government 2-3 weeks.

Earlier, Amarinder had announced during the budget session that a new mining policy will be unveiled by the state government shortly “to eliminate the mining mafia completely from the state.”

They have also curtailed visiting hours and restricted the number of visitors per patient to just one to minimize the latter’s contact with outsiders. Doctors and medical staff have been asked to use protective gear like gloves and masks and stay quarantined at home if they have travelled to the affected countries or states in the last fortnight. At least one hospital has barred visitors from all their wards, allowing entry to only family members of ICU patients. Belle Vue Clinic has barred medical representatives’ entry following a meeting with doctors. The latter felt it was advisable since their presence often leads to a crowding at the lobby area, which is also used by patients and their families. That apart, they come in close proximity to doctors who can’t avoid physical contact with patients. “There is a danger of transmission from medical representatives to patients through the doctors. Medical representatives have to be mobile and keep coming in contact with a cross-section of people. The bar will remain in force till further notice,” said Belle Vue CEO P Tandon. The hospital has put up a notice announcing the ban and has restricted the entry of visitors to just one per patient.AMRI Hospitals, too, have prohibited the entry of medical representatives across its three units from Monday. It has also barred patients’ visitors in the morning and restricted their entry to just one hour in the evening. Doctors welcomed the decision and said it will help to prevent transmission. “Physical contact has to be reduced to the extent possible on hospital premises. Medical representatives have a roving job and need to interact with doctors. The latter must have access to patients and may end up infecting them in case they expose themselves to potential carriers of the coronavirus . The move will help to reduce the chances of infection,” said AMRI Hospital consultant Debashish Saha.He added that while senior doctors will have little difficulty if they cut themselves off from medical representatives, junior medics may need their help. “Till the Covid-19 fear persists, seniors may help juniors with medicine names. It is indeed necessary to avoid contact with outsiders,” added Saha.Medical representatives have also been temporarily barred from RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS). The hospital has also banned the entry of patients’ visitors across its wards, except for those admitted at the ICU and those undergoing surgery. “Only one relative is allowed along with each patient visiting the OPD. Patient relatives are requested to avoid coming to the hospital as much as possible. Screening of every individual at entry point in the OPD and in-patient area for fever is being carried out with infra-red thermometers. We are providing necessary information over the PA system as well as brochures across the hospital,” said RTIICS zonal director R Venkatesh Medica Superspecialty Hospital has not been allowing medical representatives on its premises since 2018.

It was the moment when the doctors pulled up their socks and took crucial decisions for initiating the treatment.Taking it as a challenge, the doctors and healthcare staff worked tirelessly.

Those who went home maintained some distance with their family and took rest in sepa650rate room ensuring safety of their family by ensuring personal hygiene. A lot of doctors did not celebrate Holi, as they were busy handling Covid-19 patients and suspected cases. Without bothering about their own safety, doctors did not hesitate to enter the ICU, where the Covid-19 patients were undergoing treatment.“When I reach home, I sleep in a separate room for safety of my family, though I took proper care of my personal hygiene,” said Dr Prakash Keswani, professor (medicine), doctor treating the Italian couple who tested positive for Covid-19 and the 85-year-old patient, who returned from Dubai on February 28 and tested positive for the disease on March 10.Doctors also faced difficulty in communicating with the 69-year-old Italian patient who does not know English.

We decided that we should start anti-retroviral therapy, which is safe for the patients,” said Dr Singh.SMS Medical College wanted to tread cautiously before starting the treatment. “We decided to start the treatment. Before that, we wanted to take permission of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

She said Rajsamand is home to many historic sites such as Haldighati, Dever and Kumbhalgarh Fort that have witnessed the valour of the legendary Maharana Pratap. Proposing a new circuit for these historic places, she said, “These sites can together constitute a tourist circuit that presents to the people of India and the world the glorious history of Mewar.”

Drawing attention to the urgency of expediting projects under Swadesh Darshan, she said that a monitoring mechanism should be constituted. “Development of 79 thematic circuits have been sanctioned so far under the Swadesh Darshan scheme. May I suggest that a state monitoring mechanism for Swadesh Darshan Scheme should also be put in place to expedite implementation,” she said.

During her speech, she said Jaipur is an important tourist destination and now a Unesco World Heritage Site. “That’s why the city should have more direct international flights, especially to and from European countries and better connectivity to other cities in Rajasthan as well as India, including our other tourist hubs like Kerala and Goa. Incentives could be given to airlines to encourage them to start these flights,” she said.

Monday was the last date for scrutiny of papers. The last date of withdrawal of nominations is March 18.

Congress has nominated AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal and one of the general secretaries of the state Congress, Neeraj Dangi, for the two seats it hopes to win with the present strength in the assembly. Both filed four nomination papers each while BJP’s Rajendra Gehlot and Omkar Singh Lekhawat filed three and two nominations, respectively.

The saffron party with its present strength in the assembly could win only one seat. But the party preferred two candidates. According to sources, the party is testing the political waters with an additional nomination.

The nomination of Lakahwat at the last minute has created consternation within the Congress camp as it is fighting the flight of MLAs in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. The party is wary of machinations by the BJP in Rajasthan as there is discontentment among the MLAs in the faction-ridden party.

Congress sources believe that Lakhawat is a dummy candidate and would most probably withdrew from the contest on the last date of withdrawal on March 18.

The discussion started with Congress’s Jairam Ramesh addressing the House in Sanskrit, claiming that the classical language had been the monopoly of a few while it enriched many other Indian languages. He said while Sanskrit is part of our legacy, the “beautiful language” has also been the instrument of caste oppression, caste discrimination and caste subjugation. He said hardly 15,000 people speak Sanskrit as “ the language of priests and courts has never been aa popular one”.

TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy and HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal also spoke in Sanskrit.

Ramesh referred to a government reply in Lok Sabha in which it had said that the Centre had spent Rs 640 crore to make Sanskrit popular while only Rs 24 crore was spent on Tamil, Rs 3 crore each on Telugu and Kannada and nothing on Malayalam and Odia. “Sir, we may not like this, but, this is a fact that historically Sanskrit has always been the elite language,” he said. BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav objected to Sanskrit being called “the elite’s language”.

He also used urged HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal to liberate central universities from the stranglehold of his ministry.

Left parties DMK and MDMK also claimed that Sanskrit is the monopoly of a very few. MDMK leader Vaiko’s observation that the bill was “disastrous” met with huge opposition from treasury benches. Another Congress member P L Hanumanthiah said the bill was brought at a time when “there are two students and 20 professors” in some Sanskrit departments. The debate took an interesting turn when BJP MP Subramanian Swamy pointed out how one has to learn Sanskrit in NASA, if he wants to study artificial intelligence.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Monday claimed that it took action inside the campus of Jamia Millia Islamia on the eve of protests in December last year to “rescue innocent students trapped inside and to ensure normalcy”. The claims are part of an action taken report (ATR) filed before a Delhi court on a plea of the university registrar seeking action against cops for “unauthorised entry and excessive force”.

On January 22, the court had asked Jamia Nagar police to file the ATR on the plea filed by the university on excessive police action in its campus on December 15. The court was acting on the university’s plea seeking registration of FIR against “accused persons”. The court had asked the SHO of Jamia police station to inform by March 16, whether any complaint has been received from the university by the police. “If yes, whether any action has been taken on the said complaint. Whether any investigation or inquiry has been conducted in this regard, and if yes, what’s its status? If any cognizable offence is made out, whether any FIR has been registered or not,” it had said.

Delhi Police, however, refuted the varsity’s claims justifying its action. Its ATR read, “Action was required to be taken in light of the on-going violence from within the university campus and to rescue innocent students trapped inside and to ensure normalcy.” Police also went on to claim that cops were unable to distinguish between the “trapped students and rioters”, who allegedly carried petrol bombs. “Therefore, all were asked to evacuate with their ‘hands up’. This exercise was undertaken as it was already dark. Rioters had destroyed /damaged the lights inside the campus,” it claimed.

The ATR further said that an “unruly mob” which was slowly retreating, instead of dispersing strategically went inside the Jamia campus and used the university campus as a cover. “It started pelting stones, tube-lights, etc., resulting in grievous injuries to the police personnel. Police said that a few miscreants had entered into the university complex and considering the situation, police reached outside the varsity campus. “With a view to contain violence and maintain law and order, police was constrained to enter the university campus,” it said. According to its claims, 52 people were held.

The court has posted the matter for hearing on April 7.

HYDERABAD: AIMIM floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi on Monday urged chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to get a GO issued to stop the houselisting and data collection exercise as part of National Population Register, scheduled to begin on April 1.

While extending support to the resolution against CAA, NPR and NRC introduced by the TRS government, Akbaruddin said the government should issue a GO to stay NPR and notify separate dates for Census. “There are also requests to delink Census and NPR to ensure that the Census process is not harmed,” Akbaruddin said.There are widespread apprehensions, protests and call for boycotts against NPR. “We express our concerns that fears against NPR will derail the Census exercise,” he said.

Stating that CAA, NPR and NRC were not only dividing the country but also weakening it, Owaisi said: “We should be making laws that unite people but CAA is creating fissures in society.” “I am proud to be a Hindustani Muslim. Identify me as an Indian Muslim and not just as a Muslim. I love this country and will give my life for it,” he said.

The Constitution treats a man with a tilak, a turbaned Sikh and a bearded Muslim as equals. “The CM has honoured this constitutional principle by introducing a resolution against CAA, NPR and NRC. This country belongs to people of all religions and even those who do not belong to any religion but CAA, NPR and NRC has divided the nation into pro- and anti-groups,” he said.

459,['17/03/2020'],"Hotels resort to cost cuts, employees worst hit","Agra: In the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak which has led to widespread shutdown across the globe, those in the hospitality industry, one of the worst affected by the pandemic, have started cutting costs by either sacking temporary employees or sending permanent ones on advance leave. Some hotels have also introduced discount packages to attract customers as there has been almost 50 to 60% decline in occupancy.

Rakesh Chauhan, president of Hotel and Restaurants’ Association in Agra that covers around 330 budget hotels, said that most of the facilities have only 10% occupancy at present as against the usual rate of 90%. “This is one of the worst seasons for us and no one knows when the situation will improve,” he added.

Hari Sukumar, vice-president of Jaypee Palace, said, “All hotels in the city are bleeding. Most hotels have put a freeze on hiring and are rationalising human resources by ensuring that the staff members are sent on annual leave for at least 15 days. Also, various floors and wings are being shut to ensure cost efficiency.”

“We are reducing contractual employees and are retaining only essential manpower till the situation improves,” he added, noting around 250 contractual employees are involved in day-to-day works like security, kitchen and housekeeping.

Expressing similar views, chief operating officer of Clarks Shiraj in Agra, Debashish Bahumik, said that hotel occupancy is just 20-25% at present and will go down further in the upcoming days. He added that though some bookings are still open, they do not know whether the guests would arrive or not due to the lockdown.

Bhaumik said, “We have already shut down two out of three buildings to save cost. However, the main building, where there are restaurants and 102 rooms, are operational to provide all facilities to the guests.” He added that some permanent employees have been asked to go on leave now instead of the off season. “Similarly, contractual workers have been reduced by 70%, in proportion to the occupancy.”

The COO said that these are only short-term measures and the actual situation would be clear only by April 15. “It’s a tough time for the industry and the worst part is that online room booking portals are not sharing the distress by reducing their commissions,” he added.

After a long tug-of-war between the state government and the state election commission, the directorate of local bodies (DLB) on the directions of state government will file an application in court on Tuesday requesting for postponement of elections.

For the same, legal opinion from additional advocate general was also sought on Monday. Directorate of local bodies (DLB) director, Ujjwal Rathore said, “The decision to file an application in the court for the postponement of elections will be decided at the state government level. We have explored all the possibilities at our end and will file, if directions are given.”

The government will also present cases of different states including Andhra Pradesh where civic bodies elections were postponed even after candidates filed their nomination.

Government sources claimed that the EC earlier stressed on conducting elections as no case of Covid-19 was found in Kota and Jodhpur. “On March 15, the DLB wrote a letter to the SEC demanding the postponement of elections. The department had cited letters from collectors of the three districts. But the commission sent its reply saying that the elections should be held on time,” said a source.

Jaipur collector Joga Ram and Kota collector Om Prakash Kasara on Saturday wrote to secretary local self government department (LSG) Bhawani Singh Detha urging him to reschedule and postpone the elections to the six newly formed municipal corporations, scheduled for April 5.

It was reasoned, during elections, the crowd will gather at one place. They also didn't rule out the possibility of the virus spreading with people using electronic voting machines (EVMs) and pressing the buttons with their fingers during the election. The collectors also stated that ahead of the elections, the public meetings and campaigns organised by political parties attract huge number of people. Also, the poll officials gather during the training sessions and attract a lot of crowd, they pointed out.

HYDERABAD: TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said the TRS was founded on secular principles and it will remain committed to safeguarding the social fabric of the country and cosmopolitan culture of Telangana prevailing for hundreds of years.

“Just because TRS and MIM are friendly parties, it does not mean that TRS will not differ with MIM on any issue. When the issue of Article 370 came up, I said I would be the first to support it. The TRS supported abrogation of Article 370 as it was in the interests of the country,” KCR said.

“When it comes to CAA, NPR and NRC, daal mein kuch kaala hai. No one is trusting the Centre because Union home minister says NPR is not connected to NRC but the report submitted to Parliament says NPR is the first step towards NRC. I never thought in my 40 years career that I would have to hear comments like goli maaro saalo ko. It may give devilish pleasure temporarily but is not good for the country in the long run,” KCR said.

Stating that the TRS has strong reasons to oppose CAA, NPR and NRC, he said, “People have given TRS, a party founded on secular principles, the mandate in every election in Telangana. It is essential to respond to CAA, NPR and NRC and state our opinion to the Centre. If we are wrong, people will punish us,” he said.

KCR made it clear that the TRS will support any decision of the Centre for the safety and security of the country. “In case of giving national identity cards, or building a wall on the borders, TRS will support. But there should be a framework acceptable to all in the interests of the country,” KCR said.

We must abide by the orders of the government as it is in the interest of the students, so we have decided to promote students till class VII. This decision has been taken by all the private English medium schools of CBSE and RBSE boards. Students will be promoted based on their performance in half-yearlies and other tests,” said Sharma.

Many schools have already started to take these steps. Madhu Maini, principal of Jayshree Periwal International School, Jaipur said that in their school marks are not based on final exams. “We have tests all through the year.

At the centre of the hall is a large and oval wooden table where close to 25 officials are quietly and patiently answering to all kind of queries coming in from not only all parts of the country, but also foreign countries. The only sound is that of the phones ringing as the NCDC officials go about their work efficiently.“This room is usually used for coordinating with our other state branches of NCDC and as control room during outbreaks. However, the last time we received so many calls was perhaps during the SARS outbreak in 2009,” said a senior NCDC official.“Majority of the calls are from people who have fever, cough and sneezing. Many appear anxious and we try to reassure them that these are also the symptoms for flu and other bacterial infections, which is caused during this time due to changing season,” he said.“We tell them that only if they have travelled abroad recently or have contact history with those who have coronavirus, they should call the helpline and ask for an ambulance to get tested,” he said.The NCDC control room is operational 24X7 and while NCDC officials man 30 phone lines between 8am and 8pm, 20 phone lines are operational between 8pm and 8am.“Those answering the phones are research officers and other officials, who have been trained about coronavirus.

MADURAI: The Madras high court on Monday dismissed a plea which sought to close the elephant rescue and rehabilitation centre at Trichy, citing that it is functioning without obtaining recognition from the central government.

A division bench of justice P N Prakash and justice G Jayachandran passed the order while hearing a plea filed by Deepak P Nambiar , a resident of Puducherry.

The petitioner stated that he came to know that the centre at MR Palayam in Trichy was functioning without approval of the authorities under the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change and Central Zoo Authority as mandated under section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 and Section 38H of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

He further said the state forest department is using the MR Palayam Reserve Forest for construction of several structures including elephant shelters, veterinary hospital, quarters for forest officials, mahouts without getting any approval. Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to close the centre till prior recognition is obtained from the central government.

Officials said the damages would be recovered from the rioters after establishing the liability. Sources said the letter was written last week and is currently with the administrative side of the chief justice of Delhi’s office. “No decision has been taken yet,” said an official, requesting anonymity.

According to officials, an assessor may also be appointed to assist the claims commissioner, who can be a retired judge or a civil servant. The commissioner may summon the videos or other recordings from private and public sources to identify and quantify the damages and establish nexus with the perpetrators of the damage.

Once the liability is fixed, it will be shared by the actual perpetrators of the crime as well as the organisers of the event. The claims commissioner will prepare a report and submit it to the high court or Supreme Court, which will determine the liability after hearing the parties.

Replying on a debate in the Parliament on riots in northeast Delhi, Union home minister Amit Shah had also said that people who indulged in violence would have to pay the cost of the damage they did. He had said that the government would make sure their properties are seized.

“A lot of property had been destroyed in riots. We have written to Delhi high court to set up a claims commission. Whoever has done the damage will be identified and their property will be seized,” Shah had said.

477,['17/03/2020'],"Kolkata: No waiver on cancelled trips, flyers left in lurch","Representative image

Kolkata: Several airlines, both international and domestic, have refused to waive charges in the wake of the cancellation rush in many sectors while charging sky-high fares on select flights that have seen a sudden spurt in demand.

Speaking to TOI, people who had booked both international and domestic flights said on Monday that the airlines had turned down requests for waiving cancellation charges, owing to “customers’ inability to travel” at a time when the spread of Covid-19 virus had triggered unprecedented lockdowns and travel curbs worldwide.

“When I went to cancel a trip to Europe that I had planned for next month, the travel agent said the airline was allowing waiver of rescheduling fees and would levy cancellation charges. And even if the cancellation is processed, there is no clarity on when refund will come through,” pointed out executive Anuradha Kumar , who had paid over Rs 2.8 lakh for a round trip for four.

Trader Sushil Banik, who planned to travel to the US with friends but cannot do so now as the consulate had shut visa interviews, said it was unfair on the part of airlines to refuse refunds in an extraordinary situation like this. “We booked tickets intending to travel. We wouldn’t have done so had we foreseen the crisis. Experts are unable to predict how long the novel coronavirus will continue to play havoc,” said Banik, who may lose over Rs 4 lakh if the airline does not refund money for four return tickets.

According to International Air Transport Association , the revenue loss to the airline industry due to Covid-19 could scale $113 billion and push several airlines to the brink of bankruptcy.

In case an airline goes bankrupt, like Wow Airlines in Europe and Jet Airways in India, customers have to forgo any hope of recovering money. In Kolkata, the business loss is expected to be around Rs 1,000 crore.

An industry insider — while conceding that the situation was a tough one — alleged that travel agents and airlines were colluding to curb cancellations and push for flight rescheduling to retain money.

“My daughter’s destination wedding reception that was scheduled in April had to be cancelled because she and her fiance, foreign nationals, are yet to get visa. When we approached the airline for cancellation, they quoted an extremely high cancellation fee. They gave us an option to reroute the trip. But if that fare is lower than the one I have paid, I shall have to forgo the difference. Also, airlines are imposing different rules for tickets purchased online and those bought from their office,” a Ballygunge resident said.

Meanwhile, airlines continue to charge exorbitant fares on sectors in which there is a demand spike. These include Dhaka-bound flights on the international front and Kolkata-bound flights from Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Pune. While the former is driven by thousands of Bangladeshis queueing up to return home, the latter comprises mostly students who want to return home because educational institutions in those cities have shut down.

A one-way ticket from Bangalore to Kolkata for Tuesday cost between Rs 25,000 and Rs 13,000. The noprmal fare hovers between Rs 3,550 and Rs 46,660. Similar has been the situation for sectors like Delhi and Mumbai with one-way tickets to Kolkata being sold at Rs 6,096 and Rs 6,607 respectively — at least Rs 2,000 more than the usual fare.

Nagpur: Even as educational institutions, hostels and the like have declared holidays till March 31 amid coronavirus scare, all the three regional transport offices (RTOs) — Nagpur city, deputy RTO east and rural — continue to conduct learner’s driving licence tests in confined rooms at their premises.

Senior officials from these offices admitted that no instructions over learner’s licence (LL) tests were issued, and the tests were being conducted as usual. At present, around 648 people can appear for learner’s licence tests and around 500 for permanent driving licence tests daily in all the three offices.

Team TOI visited the city RTO office in Priyadarshani Colony on Monday, and found hundreds of people visiting for various works. At least 40 people were spotted in the waiting hall of the learner’s licence section on the ground floor, and around five people were present inside the test room.

TOI found no precautions being taken — either for the candidates appearing for the test or for the transport department officials taking the test. The RTO inspector was wearing an ordinary mask, while the rest of the staff members in the room were working without any preventive gear.

Around 200 people can appear for the learner’s licence test in the city office, while for east and rural offices, the quota is 248 and 200, respectively.

“The tests for permanent licences are carried out at the driving track and hence, there’s a relatively lesser risk of being contracted with the deadly disease. As the LL test is carried out in closed rooms, the spread of the disease cannot be ruled out,” said a senior official from the department.

Barring learner’s and permanent driving licence tests, the department has launched many services, including paying registration fees, taxes, transfer of ownerships etc online.

Despite the available online services, hundreds visit these three offices to get their work done.

One of the applicants, requesting anonymity, was surprised to see the transport department conducting tests in closed rooms. “Appearing for the test in a confined room in such a crisis situation is a scary,” she said.

Another applicant said that the office should have kept hand sanitizers outside the exam room for applicants. But no such arrangements were made. He added that the office should have cancelled the tests.

Similarly, no instructions have been issued to motor vehicle inspectors deputed at check-posts. To meet revenue targets, their seniors have been asking them to register more cases.

Transport commissioner Shekhar Channe did not respond to TOI’s calls and text messages, while district collector and chairman of regional transport authority Ravindra Thakre assured to look into the issue.

Be positive to beat isolation","Nagpur: Voluntary or involuntary home quarantine is all set to become a norm for travellers coming from a certain set of countries as the government has taken serious note of increasing number of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) cases in the state.As per figures provided by district collector, 95 persons in Nagpur are already under home quarantine. This number is set to grow as the state government, on Monday, decided to advise compulsory home isolation for travellers arriving from Dubai, Saudi Arabia and the USA apart from the seven already declared high-risk nations — China, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Iran and South Korea.Being cut off from the physical world, though for a few days, may not be easy for some. Those who have to remain in isolation will have to engage themselves in some positive activities to cope with the stress.Renowned psychiatrist Dr Sudhir Bhave said use of mindfulness is a must during the quarantine period. “Mindfulness is human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we are doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us. You learn to look at yourself from an outsider’s point of view. Try this technique in advance and get yourself trained in it,” he said.“I will suggest a quote by Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist Viktor E Frankl. He says, everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way,” Dr Bhave concluded.Remaining detached with others in one room for 14 days is psychologically challenging task, said eminent psychologist Prof Raja Akash. “If you are thinking that you will watch web series, enjoy online games and social media and spend 14 days comfortably, you are wrong. These are not proper solutions for the anxiety, or depression you may face during this period,” he said. According to him, reading, writing, craft work, painting etc can be more fulfilling.“You are detained, but not alone. You can always speak to your friends on phone. Conversation with your loved ones, distant friends after a long time could ease mental pressure a lot,” he added.Yoga trainer and director of a health care company Praful Hatgaonkar gave a complete yoga prescription for people who will be quarantined. “Physical problems like gases, unnecessary weight gain and indigestion can arise during the quarantine period.

MADURAI: Madras high court on Monday sought a response from the state commission (SEC) as to when indirect election would be conducted for the Thiruppuvanam panchayat union in Sivaganga district .

After the Sivaganga district collector postponed the indirect election which was scheduled to be held for the post of chairperson and vice-chairperson of Thiruppuvanam panchayat union on March 4, S Subbiah, a resident of Sivaganga district had moved the high court Madurai bench seeking SEC to notify the date for conducting indirect election.

Hearing the plea, a division bench of justice S S Sundar and justice T Krishnavalli sought a response from the SEC as to whether the collector had power to cancel the indirect election citing law and order problems and if the SEC had sought an explanation from the collector in this regard.

The case was adjourned to March 23 for further hearing.

The petitioner stated that he is a member of the DMK and was elected as ward 12 councillor of Thiruppuvanam panchayat union. There are 17 wards in the union and DMK and its alliance have a majority with six DMK councillors, two Congress councillors while there are only three AIADMK councillors.

Since the DMK has majority, the officials had already postponed the indirect election twice earlier anticipating law and order problems. The election which was scheduled to be held on March 4 was also postponed for the third time, he said.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to quash the order which postponed the indirect election and sought the SEC to notify indirect election by appointing an independent district election officer and by providing adequate police protection.

490,['17/03/2020'],"Civil society listens to Delhi riot victims, aid workers","The jury observed that had police responded to the calls for help, the violence in northeast Delhi could have ... Read More

NEW DELHI: Twenty-two days after the outbreak of communal violence in northeast Delhi , a people’s tribunal organised by civil society organisations heard testimonies of the riot-affected residents and the lawyers, health-workers and activists who are helping survivors and victims’ piece together livelihoods, claim compensation and seek healthcare.

During the daylong tribunal on Monday, what repeatedly came to the fore was the “continuing failure of police in filing of FIRs” and the absence of the state government on the ground. The jury concluded that the “major trigger was Kapil Mishra’s speech in the presence of a smiling policeman”. It felt that had police responded to the calls for help, the violence could have been contained. “When police did come, the rioters stepped back. One policeman singularly managed to save hundreds of lives we heard,” said Tanika Sarkar, member of the six-person jury that included fellow academic Apoorvananda, retired Justice Aftab Alam, activists Harsh Mander and Syeda Hameed and journalist Pamela Philipose. The testimonies included the accounts of around 30 victims and the experiences of lawyers, health workers and women’s activists in relief and rehabilitation.

Shah Rukh, whose shop in Maujpur was destroyed, broke down at the communal slurs targeted at him in the police station when he went to file a complaint. He was told his shop “had to burn” and that he had won “azadi”. Lawyer Swapnil Gupta rued that police “who could not maintain law and order are now tasked to bring justice”.

Mukesh Chand of Brahmpuri Road was anguished that friendships of decades were snapped. “We have to live together. We will again. For sure,” he said. Another survivor who ran educational institutes in the riot-hit neighbourhoods said, “We want to rebuild but are told by locals that we wouldn’t be allowed to.” Mander observed that this breakdown in neighbourly relations and the humiliation and communal slurs at the hand of the cops was most disturbing.

Mishika Singh, a lawyer, recounted how their volunteer teams discovered that while police complaints were being filed with the guarantee that FIRs would be lodged in two-four days, every FIR clubbed 10-15 incidents and “had no details, no names”. For compensation, the SDM’s office required the complaint plus the copy of the FIR. Singh said the gap between police and the SDM’s office had increased anxieties among the survivors and delayed compensation.

“The battering of Muslims has reduced people’s expectations [of justice] to a new low,” Naqvi told the jury, while Apoorvananda said healthcare, among AAP’s election-winning pitches, “was nowhere on the scene when it was most required”.

491,['17/03/2020'],"Nirbhaya case: Tihar Jail gets ready for final act, dummy run today","File photo of Nirbhaya case convicts

NEW DELHI: The preparations to execute the death warrant of the four Nirbhaya gang-rape-cum-murder convicts began in full swing at Tihar Jail on Monday. A team of engineers from the public works department visited the jail premises to check the tenacity of the gallows and also conducted a suspension test on the hanging bar. They will also be present when the hangman conducts a dummy hanging from these bars on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the jail authorities conducted a brain mapping test of the four convicts — Mukesh Singh, Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma — during a counselling session to gauge their anxiety level. The exercise was conducted to ensure that they don’t suffer from sleep disorders or loss of appetite, leading to a weight loss, a source said.

The PWD team inspected the newly constructed portion of the gallows built to accommodate all four convicts. The final tests were carried out on Monday under the supervision of an additional inspector-general-rank jail officer. The pathway between the solitary cells and the hanging well, too, was inspected to remove any obstruction.

A jail official said the Manilla ropes that would be used in the hanging were greased with butter and mashed bananas on Monday and will be kept ready for the hangman, Pawan, when he arrives on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the jail counsellor and mental health experts from AIIMS who have been counselling inmates spoke to each of them individually. A source said that while Singh had been a recluse, the three others were still in denial about their execution and had expressed hope that their execution might get stalled after they moved the International Court of Justice on Monday.

While family members of Singh and Gupta have had their last meeting on Friday, Sharma’s family will meet him on Tuesday. Thakur’s family had last met him earlier this month after which no one reached out to the jail authorities for a meeting.

The jail authorities allowed the family members of the two convicts to have a one-to-one meeting with them during which they could physically touch them.

To avoid any untoward incident, additional personnel have been deployed round the clock outside the solitary cells of the four convicts since Monday.

MADURAI: The court-appointed guardian of the minor boy who lost his parents submitted a report before the Madras high court with suggestions regarding the protection of the boy and his properties.

A habeas corpus petition was filed by V Rajan Selvin , relative of the boy seeking to produce him int the court. The petitioner said that following the death of the boy’s parents, few people had attempted to usurp his properties.

During the course of the earlier hearings, the court took serious view in this case and exercised ‘ parens patriae ’ jurisdiction in the welfare of the minor boy. The court directed the sub-registrar to cancel the power of attorney issued in favour of the people as they created bogus documents including fake Aadhaar card of the boy in an attempt to usurp his properties.

Two cases were registered against three persons including Lakshmanan for allegedly forging documents. All the properties of the boy are kept under safe custody of the Palayamkottai assistant commissioner of police (ACP) based on the directions of this court.

During the previous hearing, the court had appointed a senior counsel Veera Kathiravan as the guardian of the boy and his properties and directed him to visit the boy and file a report.

Pursuant to the direction of this court, senior counsel who had visited the boy who is currently in a home in Tirunelveli district submitted a report before the court on Monday. He suggested to make the boy understand the importance of education and also recommended a psychiatrist to evaluate his condition.

He also suggested that the boy could continue to stay at the home and his relatives may be allowed to visit him so that he does not feel like an orphan. He further suggested that the boy’s properties could be rented out to generate financial assistance to him and opined that the Palayamkottai ACP could continue to maintain the bank accounts of the boy.

Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of Justice P N Prakash and Justice G Jayachandran adjourned the case to March 19 for further hearing.
