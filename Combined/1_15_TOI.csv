Youngsters talk about celebrating Pongal in their city

We speak to four young and talented artistes from different fields — singer Swagatha S Krishna, Bharatanatyam dancer Kavya Muralidharan, Silambam artiste Kowshik Palanisamy and Tamil rapper Killadi Ram — to find out what Pongal means to them and their plans for this Pongal

What Pongal means to you?

Killadi Ram: My native is Uranganpatti, near Madurai. I am so proud to call myself a Madurai paiyyan. For many, the first day of Pongal is special. But for us, it is maattu pongal. Cows are worshipped in our place and maattu pongal is bigger than Deepavali. Alanganallur is considered the place for jallikattu. When my parents were young, jallikattu used to take place in our native, Uranganpatti. Today, almost 1000 cows from our place participate in the fest. Everyone should take a trip to their native place for Pongal. If Chennai is your native place, try getting your friends together and celebrate the festival. We need to keep the tradition alive, don’t we?

Swagatha S Krishnan: I am from Madurai and Pongal is celebrated in a big way there. I have three siblings and no matter where we are, we all get together in Madurai for Pongal. This time, though, I will be in Chennai as my parents are travelling. Pongal in Madurai used to be special. We make sakkarai pongal in uruli and will have a huge set-up on our terrace. My parents are amazing cooks and we get to eat yummy food. There is no television or watching movies for us during Pongal. I love looking at people, hearing naatupura paadal in the speakers outside our homes and watch the decked up cows. But I don’t see anything of that in Chennai. People here should feel the spirit of the festival. As artistes, we should advocate events that help bring our culture alive.

Kowshik Palanisamy: I am from Erode and I go home every Pongal. Idhu Thamizhar thirunaal… and this reminds me of my culture and tradition. For the festival, we make pongal in a traditional style and wear new clothes.

Our neighbour has cows and we worship them during maattu pongal. This is the only time I get to celebrate and spend time with relatives and family members. I don’t know whether the city dwellers have seen our culture or not. I will promote my traditional martial art form. Today, so many apartments conduct games in theirpremises. If I perform for them once, I am sure people would be interested to watch us. After all, this is our tradition, right?

Kavya Muralidharan: Pongal vandhu Thamizhar panbaadu. We get four days of holidays to soak in our tradition and culture. I was born and raised here. I happened to watch traditional folk dances and martial art performances when I was 10 years old. And that memory is still afresh. Even though amma makes Pongal in a traditional style, I don’t think my brother or any other kid today knows how it is done in smaller towns or villages. Malls should encourage performing artistes so that the next generation watches and savours them. I also wish to hear a lot more graamiya padalgal.

Your Pongal memories...

Killadi Ram: Our day starts by six and I help amma with her chores. Pongal is one festival where all our relatives and friends come together in our native place. Naan oru vaati maattai koode pudhichen. Apart from sakkarai pongal, amma makes ukkarai. And of course, we get new clothes, and are treated like royals back home.

Swagatha S Krishnan: My father used to take us to Alanganallur to watch the jallikattu. And of course, we have gone on bullock cart rides. There used to be a lot of competitions in our native place. My siblings and I take part in kolam contest. We draw cow, karumbu, paanai and use a lot of colour podi.

Kowshik Palanisamy: Performing during Pongal is my most favourite memory. We are a team of 70, and call ourselves Dronas Silambam. Pongal festivities are conducted in several organisations and we take our art to them. We also perform in our native during Pongal day. This is something that we have been doing for 10 years now, and I look forward to it.

Kavya Muralidharan: Pongal has always been about performances for me. Every year, I remember performing in some sabha or the other. This time, it is even more special as I will be performing in the main slot at Sri Krishna Gana Sabha. And yes, kolams are special for us. We draw a huge kolam outside our office and I am in-charge of colouring them.

The actress will be playing a dancer in debutant Jai Vijay Kumar ’s Irali , which stars Vennish Kanna in the lead.“I can say for sure that no one else has used bananas to narrate a story that is of utmost importance to our society,” begins the director confidently, “In 2010, when I was assisting SP Rajkumar sir, I had gone to Koyambedu to buy a banana thaar. I’d seen people immersing bunch of fruits in a drum full of chemicals. When I enquired, I was told that while it may take a week for bananas to ripen naturally, spraying them with chemicals, like certain kinds of acid powders fastens the process. I also learnt that if the amount of chemicals exceeds the permissible quantity, the fruits could turn poisonous and it may lead to cancer. It got me thinking, and I decided to make a film based on that.”The team got Cheran to launch the title of the film. “Irali is a word we picked up from Tirukkural, and it means Theengu (harm). The film is set in Pollachi, and the team has almost completed the movie. “It’s a simple story that narrates the ill effects of industrial chemical waste,” says Vijay Kumar, who has previously directed a few short films, “When I had met a distributor in Tiruppur, he told me the story is very relatable because recently, several tonnes of artificially ripened bananas were seized by officials.”Vennish insists that the film will be an entertaining fare and not be preachy. “Yes, we have a message — tampering with nature will have disastrous effects. The film traces the lives of four farmers and their sons, who lease out an agricultural land that has lost its fertility because of illegal dumping of untreated industrial chemical waste. How they then start working for a man who deals in bananas and educate others in their village about the harms of disturbing nature’s balance has been narrated in an entertaining manner,” he signs off.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73250310,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1436059/73250310.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/saniya-iyappan-will-play-a-dancer-in-her-kollywood-debut/articleshow/73250310.cms

Except for the fact that Kannada star Shivarajkumar was back in the lead, there are absolutely no details about the film in the public domain. That has changed now, as Harsha released the first visuals from the film on the auspicious festive occasion. “We didn’t want to reveal details and visuals from the film earlier on, as it would take away the novelty factor,” Harsha maintained. While sources had hinted that Shivarajkumar would have a unique look in the film, the poster teases audiences with a sneak peek of that. It also features another character bearing a torch in hand, and appears to be in search of something, which adds to the curiosity. “This character will be releaved in February. If you can see, the character looks like a brahmin in search of something. There is an element of spirituality in the film, which is what has been revealed here,” says Harsha. He also reveals that the film is set over multiple timelines. “We have a period element to it, as well as segments that are set in present day. And Shivarajkumar’s look is something that we are eager to reveal, but fans will have to wait till March when we show it fully,” says Harsha.Bhajarangi 2 will see Shivarajkumar paired with hisleading lady Bhavana again.

3,['15/01/2020'],Fire lines created to prevent forest fire in Bandipur,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Forest fires are a concern for people across the world. Even as Australia continues to battle the bush fires that have been ravaging the continent, back home, officials have been working tirelessly ensure that our forests do not fall prey to a blaze. A year ago, the Bandipur Tiger Reserve lost flora and fauna in over 10,000 acres owing to a massive forest fire, and officials are now trying to prevent a repeat by creating a 2,550 kilometre fire line.

Towards this, the forest department is undertaking clearing of vegetation and controlled burning of the same to create bald patches of land across the boundary line of the forest to prevent the wild spreading of a fire. Speaking to us, director of Bandipur Tiger Reserve, T Balachandra, says, “We are leaving no stone unturned to ensure that last year's tragedy is not repeated. We have created 2,550 kilometres of fire lines in all 13 ranges of the Reserve. We are hoping to complete all work in creating fire lines to be completed in a week's time. We have deployed temporary watchers in all ranges to prevent any illegal acts by miscreants that could spark a fire. We are also interacting with the villagers living on the fringes of the forest to create awareness about their role in protecting forests from fires.”

A wildlife enthusiast says, “Over the last two years, the ecology in Bandipur has been severely affected by forest fires. I hope the forest department has learnt its lessons from the previous mass destruction. Right now, everything is dry in Bandipur, so chances of it catching fire are high. But if we do get a few spells of rain in February or March, that could be averted. The forest department needs to be well-equipped to prevent forest fires.”

7,['15/01/2020'],2020 begins with a bang at these Bengaluru college fests,"It was rather a thrilling start to 2020 for Bengaluru’s young folk, as two of the city’s colleges conducted their annual fests over the weekend. Many youngsters flocked to ‘Lasya 2020’, Jain (deemed-to-be) University’s inter-college cultural fest, while National Law School of India University (NLSIU’s) music fest, ‘Strawberry Fields’, also witnessed a huge turnout.Students from various colleges battled it out with their counterparts to bag coveted awards in various activities such as making group ads, fashion shows, battle of the bands and dance performances. Dancer-choreographer-actor Priyank Sharma was the judge for the inter-college dance competition on Day 2 of ‘Lasya’. This fest also hosted comic Aakash Gupta and Delhi-based band Antariksh on the same day. The battle ended with Manga from St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous) — claiming the first place.‘Strawberry Fields’, on the other hand, witnessed performances by a host of music bands and artistes like OnebyTwo, The Figs, Skrat, Parvaaz and Joshua Fernandez aka JBabe from the F16s fame. The headliners belted out original tracks — covering genres like rock and roll, indie pop and alt rock. Under the ‘Battle of the Bands’ category, artistes were seen performing their sets as well as competing with their contemporaries. The battle ended with Iyer’s Filter Coffee and Spotlight — claiming the first place.Reminiscing about his college days, Aakash said, “I was a very shy student until I joined the theatre society in my college. And that’s how I explored the artiste in me. Before that, I used to focus only on my studies and nothing else. During my days at Delhi University, we barely used to have such big events. So, now when I perform for a college crowd, it feels good and I love the energy they exude.”Sharing their story, the bandmates of Antariksh said, “Our journey as a music collective began during our university days in Delhi, when we used to jam together.”Varun Rajput, frontman of the band, added, “In 2012, we decided to leave our corporate jobs and become full-time musicians. And that’s how the band came about. Performing for college audience reminds us of our own time as students.”At the fest, dancer-choreographer Priyank was spotted inquiring about each dance team’s efforts and the narrative behind their act. “As a dancer, it is wonderful to see performances that has a story to tell, apart from good dance patterns and choreography,” he said. He also won the hearts of the students when he closed the competition with an impromptu performance, where he didn’t stick to one dance style, but instead incorporated freestyle, hip-hop and other genres.Chennai-based band, Skrat, performed their original compositions on the last day of ‘Strawberry Fields’. Expressing how much they admire Bengaluru and the college fests it hosts, frontman Sriram said, “Bengaluru is a place where one finds many music lovers, who are enthusiastic about starting their own bands as well as collaborate with other artistes, while also inculcating their unique takes on various musical genres and instruments. When we were starting out, I remember how we would compete in ‘Battle of the Bands’, and it was so difficult to secure the top positions. We still can’t believe that we are headlining the same fest.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73251008,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-153328/73251008.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/2020-begins-with-a-bang-at-these-bengaluru-college-fests/articleshow/73251008.cms

The couple will be celebrating their first Sankranti and Pongal together. “We are looking forward to this festival.

We are looking forward to the time with family as well as all the treats that will be made,” says the actor.The duo have fond memories of the harvest festival from their childhood. For Swathi, who is Tamilian, it was all about bonding with the family and community. “I grew up in Japan , so we had a close-knit Tamilian community there that used to celebrate the festival in all its glory, as it is bigger than Deepavali for us,” she says.As for Rishi, he recalls, “I remember making sakkare achchu when I was younger. Today, we get all the things that we gift other households readily in the markets. But during my childhood, we used to partake in the festivities and make the hampers that were to be gifted to relatives and neighbours. In fact, I never realised that giving ellu-bella to households was up to the ladies of the household. I used to get bullied by my sister Nethra into joining her.”Rishi and Swathi, who are still finding their way around the kitchen, admit that they aren’t the biggest of cooks.

10,['15/01/2020'],Deepak in a medical thriller,"For a passionate artiste, language is no barrier. And that’s what drives Sandalwood actor Deepak Shetty to expand his repertoire beyond languages and regional boundaries. Deepak, who has done several Kannada and Telugu films, including Panchatantra, Aadi Lakshmi Purana and iSmart Shankar, is now debuting in Kollywood with Battery . Directed by Manibharathi , the film is a medical thriller and stars Senguttuvan and Ammu Abhirami (of Asuran fame) in the lead.“For me, doing different films in different languages is a learning experience. I get to be a different person every other day, and I get to learn a lot,” begins Deepak, “In Battery, I play a police commissioner. It’s a neutral character — he is an honest cop, and is very attached towards his family. It’s very difficult to draw a line between right and wrong for him. This character and the lead hero’s character travel together in the film.”So, did he have any difficulty in picking up Tamil? “Your confidence level is a lot better when you know the language. You can change the syntax of a sentence and narrate it in your style. But the team of Battery was very cooperative. They’d prompt me and also help me with the meaning of my lines.

11,['15/01/2020'],VK Prakash: Navya Nair: Oruthee has thrilling segments that will engage all audiences,"She lent an unforgettable charm to Balamani, the innocent, ardent devotee of Guruvayoorappan, and won a place in the hearts of Malayalis in Nandanam. Now, after an eight-year gap from her last film. Kannada-venture Dhrishya, she is all set to make a comeback through Oruthee , a V K Prakash directorial. In the midst of her shuttling between her busy dance schedules and family life, we catch up with her to know more about her comeback, family and her hopes for her second innings.I was not completely detached from films or acting. When I heard the script of the film, Oruthee, from (scriptwriter) S Suresh Babu sir last year, I found it very engaging and thrilling. I chose it, because it is not a slow-paced movie. I love commercial movies that engage the audience. Apart from the thriller element, the film is centred around my character, a common woman employed as a boat conductor. The crux of the film is a series of incidents that take place in her life over three days due to a small incident.I had permanent golden highlights on my hair and I was very much fond of it. But as part of my look for Oruthee, I had to remove that. Also, I am learning the working style of the boat conductors. I feel happy and contented to be acting again.A proper artiste will always have a desire to give a spectacular performance. The question is about the time and place for it. That is a personal decision to be taken by individuals and I chose now. Everyone can inspire themselves to perform. It is only in Malayalam films that actresses face the pre-marriage and post-marriage acting categorisation. No other industry focuses on these criteria as actresses keep performing, while managing the timely and natural changes that happen in their lives.I think the same should be applicable here too, there should not be a question over the careers of actresses before or after marriage or after she turns a mother. These should be treated as natural changes in her life. I believe that change is taking place and the new generation of actors in Malayalam will not be affected by these criteria in the future.No, there isn’t. There are still very few such, compared to the powerful women-centric films played by veteran actresses, such as Sheela and Sharada.The most important element that strengthened me is dance. When life quietened down for me, dance has played a major role to keep me engaged. Dance is like the oxygen I breathe.Mumbai made me health-conscious and made exercise a part of my life. The very first thing that comes to mind about Mumbai is the health-conscious people and their determination to keep healthy through exercise. Also, it has heightened my fashion sense. The golden highlight was an outcome of that; it was my first ever experiment on my hair.(Laughs) I dedicate my time to functional training and cross-fit exercises. There is no easy route to your goal, so I do daily workouts and take an effort to keep fit.Sai is my life. I am his mamma and he is my vava. We usually hang out for films, dining and sometimes shopping too. He is my main companion and we spend time planning events and our hangouts. My vava is a very understanding child, beyond his years. He is also the typical naughty character like any boy of his age, but he is also easy to control.At present it is only this film. I feel blessed that many still enjoy my Balamani role and am happy that it is an evergreen character in the hearts of many.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73249332,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1073736/73249332.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/navya-nair-oruthee-has-thrilling-segments-that-will-engage-all-audiences/articleshow/73248871.cms
12,['15/01/2020'],TV celebrities share Sankranti must-haves,"Being a huge fan of Makar Sankranti, which for me is synonymous with kite-flying, I make sure to go back to Ujjain to celebrate it almost every year. Whether I’m shooting or not, come Makar Sankranti and I make my way back to my native place. I have been flying kites on this festival since childhood and now feel like a professional kite-flyer. I cut more than 250 kites every year, which puts me in a happy space. But I make sure to use safe manjha (thread). Also, I love binging on homemade til ka laddoo, chikki to churma, aloo vada and dal bafla.I have grown up in Ahmedabad, but I never learnt how to fly kites. During Uttarayan in Gujarat, it was always exciting to go to the terrace and watch the colourful sky. Undhiyu, chikki and laddoos are my favourites and I wait to gorge on them.Cutting others’ kites is a skill I excel at. Earlier, Makar Sankranti used to be a family affair, but today, it’s more about getting fancy kites and arranging a DJ set-up. I still go and steal kites as I would as a kid.For me, this festival is about letting the child in me out. My cousins drop by and we have a good time, flying kites. My mother does a small puja and a havan in the morning and the night ends with scrumptious food and great company.I have some great memories attached to this festival. Flying kites had always been one of the fun activities as a child – hopping from one rooftop to another, cutting each other’s kites in a competition etc. This Makar Sankranti, too, I’ll be flying kites with friends and gorging on sarson ka saag.Besides the puja and rituals, I love eating gud gajak with peanuts. My most special memory from the time spent in my hometown Kalka is engaging in a competition with my neighbour. He was famous for making people lose at kite-flying. However, call it a stroke of luck or the Gods favouring me, he lost and co-incidentally on one Makar Sankranti. The bet was that whoever loses had to throw a party and he had to do it that evening.I have so many fond memories of celebrating this festival in Navsari, Gujarat, where I was born. All the terraces and grounds in the neighbourhood would be filled with children flying colourful kites. We would have so much fun.We celebrate Makar Sankranti with great fervour in my hometown, Delhi. My husband, Rohit Raj Goyal’s family also celebrates the festival with as much gusto. Since according to the ritual, til ki mithai comes from the girl’s side, I wait for my mom-made laddoos just as I would while I was growing up. This year, I would like to fly kites with my son Soham.Even though I have tried kite-flying as a kid, I really learnt it with my co-actors on the set of my show, Mrs & Mr Sharma Allahaba-dwale. This festival is beautiful and a lot of fun.Even today, whenever I can, I celebrate the festival in my hometown (Benaras). After flying kites, we play cricket on the terrace. It’s an annual ritual, which I look forward to.Flying kites has always fascinated me, but it should not cause any harm to birds. Festivals are supposed to bring joy, not sorrow. That’s why I request everyone not to use glass-coated manjha; instead, useuncoated cotton strings.This year, I hope to visit my hometown Delhi. My brother got married recently and we want to show my sister-in-law the way we celebrate the festival at home. I also want to gorge on homemade til laddoos, mithai and enjoy the winter after so many years. The kid in me is waiting to take over.Celebrating Sankranti with my cousins in Nadiad (Gujarat), where I was born, was fun. I remember how we would fly kites and then rush downstairs to grab them and shout, ‘Kai po che’. Now, my work does not permit me to go there, but I am craving for the til ke laddoos.Like the last eight years, I will be in Surat to celebrate it with my friends. We host parties on the terrace and fly kites. My father is a pro at flying kites and I learnt it from him.

That has changed now, as Harsha released the first visuals from the film on the auspicious festive occasion. “We didn’t want to reveal details and visuals from the film earlier on, as it would take away the novelty factor,” Harsha maintained. While sources had hinted that Shivarajkumar would have a unique look in the film, the poster teases audiences with a sneak peek of that. It also features another character bearing a torch in hand, and appears to be in search of something, which adds to the curiosity. “This character will be releaved in February. If you can see, the character looks like a brahmin in search of something. There is an element of spirituality in the film, which is what has been revealed here,” says Harsha. He also reveals that the film is set over multiple timelines. “We have a period element to it, as well as segments that are set in present day. And Shivarajkumar’s look is something that we are eager to reveal, but fans will have to wait till March when we show it fully,” says Harsha.Bhajarangi 2 will see Shivarajkumar paired with hisleading lady Bhavana again.

17,['15/01/2020'],Pankhuri Awasthy: A point came when I stopped relating to my character in 'Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai',"There had been several speculations about actress Pankhuri Awasthy quitting ' Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai ' ('YRKKH') during the course of her track on the show, which she joined in June 2019, to play Vedika. And her journey finally came to an end recently. Pankhuri tells TOI, “It was a short and sweet journey. 'YRKKH' was offered to me around the same time when I was auditioning for a film. Initially, my track was scheduled for three months and I took it up, as it would have been completed by the time I had to shoot for the film. However, my role was extended owing to the ratings.”She adds, “My track was shaping up well. However, it slipped towards the end and I just couldn’t relate to it. Besides, the ratings after my re-entry (after the break when she was shooting for the film) didn’t match up. Though the character had an edge, it became redundant. Since it made no sense to leave the show abruptly, I continued doing it.”The actress received a lot of flak for playing a negative character. She says, “During the course of my track, I received a lot of flak from viewers on my social media handles. Some even got personal. However, I didn’t mind it, as I got to explore a lot of shades while playing the part.”But, isn’t turning negative after playing a series of positive characters a challenge and also a risk, as it can get an actor stereotyped? Pankhuri replies, “I was apprehensive initially, but Vedika’s actions were triggered by her emotions. Also, I was told that the character would be justified on the show.”Post 'YRKKH', the actress is clear that she wants to play only lead roles. She explains, “I will take up only lead roles now. I don’t mind playing a negative character, if thestory revolves around her and her actions are justified.”A few weeks ago, in an interview with TOI, her husband, actor Gautam Rode , had expressed the desire to go the family way in 2020. Ask her about it and she says, “Well, if he said that, he couldn’t have decided without me (smiles!). On a serious note, we have been thinking about it and are on the same page when it comes to starting a family. Gautam and I had decided that we would start a family after two years of marriage, which we will be completing soon. I am prepared for motherhood now.

Look at the roles that I have been doing on TV so far, they are such varied characters and different stories – be it ' Chandragupta Maurya ', 'Mere Sai' or ' Ek Veer Ki Ardaas...Veera '. The only thing common in most shows is that I have played a mother, but the characters are so different. Working today is more important than thinking about being typecast – look at people getting stressed so much because they do not have work. I think what is important today is being on screen continuously, thinking about being typecast is silly,"" says Sneha, who is making her debut in the mythological genre with this show.Sneha admits that she has always wanted to do a mythological show, purely to break the monotony of doing fiction shows. ""There is so much research, homework to do in mythological shows, and I have learnt so much by just being a part of this show,"" she says, adding, ""Also, how many different types of characters do you see in fiction shows? At least, there's some interesting variety in case of mythological stories. Also when you do fiction shows, there is so much negativity, stress each day when you go back from work, I haven't experienced that while doing a mythological show,"" says Sneha, who feels that being so grand and made with precision, mythos are often ""better than a lot of other shows” on TV today.For the actress, that the major challenge that she had to face for this role was to get used to speaking her dialogues in ""shuddh Hindi"" and sounding calm and composed when saying those dialogues. ""As an actor, the biggest challenge was to calm myself down. You have to be very careful with words and how you speak them while you are a part of a mythological show and I am not at all a calm person, I am the most hyper one. I started doing yoga to calm myself. The other minor challenge was to not pay attention to clothes and jewellery and focus on performance.

21,['15/01/2020'],AAP candidate list Delhi Elections: 23 new faces in AAP’s full list of 70 for Delhi assembly showdown,"NEW DELHI: Maintaining its momentum for the assembly elections, Aam Aadmi Party has been first off the blocks in declaring its candidates. On Tuesday, it named candidates for all 70 constituencies in Delhi, which will go to polls on February 8. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will contest from New Delhi while deputy CM Manish Sisodia will be fielded from Patparganj with both having represented their respective constituencies since 2013.AAP released the list after a marathon meeting of the party’s highest decision-making body, the political affairs committee. It has re-fielded 46 of the 61 sitting MLAs and included 20 new faces besides three in the ones held by BJP. For one BJP-held seat, Mustafabad, the old candidate has been repeated. Eight women candidates have been fielded as compared to five in 2015. The party has repeated all the sitting ministers in the Arvind Kejriwal cabinet.The outcome will be known on February 11.Senior AAP functionaries Raghav Chadha, Atishi and Dilip Pandey, who had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, have been fielded from Rajinder Nagar, Kalkaji and Timarpur assembly constituencies, respectively.“Best wishes to all. Don’t be complacent. Work very hard. People have lot of faith in AAP and you. God bless,” Kejriwal tweeted in a message to his candidates.AAP had formed the government with outside support of Congress in 2013 but resigned after just 49 days. It stormed back to office in 2015 with 67 seats. It lost the Rajouri Garden seat to BJP in a 2017 bypoll, and towards the end of 2019, five MLAs – Kapil Mishra, Sandeep Kumar, Alka Lamba, Anil Bajpai and Devinder Sehrawat – were disqualified under the anti-defection law. BJP had four seats in the outgoing assembly.Party functionaries believe that release of the list by AAP, when other parties are still in the process of deciding on their candidates, shows the party’s confidence. The list contains several names who have recently switched over to AAP from Congress and BSP. Five-time MLA from Matia Mahal Shoaib Iqbal, former MLA from Badarpur Ram Singh Netaji, and former Congress leader Parlad Singh Sawhney, who had won from Chandni Chowk in 1998, 2003, 2008 and 2013 before losing in 2015, have been fielded from their strongholds. The AAP list also contains names of some businessmen.Labour minister Gopal Rai has been fielded from Babarpur, social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam from Seemapuri, transport minister Kailash Gahlot from Najafgarh, health minister Satyendra Jain from Shakur Basti and Imran Hussain from Ballimaran.The MLA from Dwarka, Adarsh Shastri — grandson of former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri — has been dropped along with 15 other MLAs. After working in different MNCs for years, Shastri had left his high-paying job to join AAP with a mission to change politics and espoused the values of transparency and probity. He won from Dwarka with a big margin in 2015.AAP has replaced Shastri with Vinay Kumar Mishra, better known as the son of former Congress MP Mahabal Mishra, who joined AAP on Monday. Vinay Mishra had contested the 2013 assembly election from Palam but could get only around 19,500 votes and lost badly.Many among the dropped MLAs expressed disappointment with the decision of the party. Badarpur MLA Narayan Dutt Sharma has turned a rebel. Sharma launched a scathing attack on Kejriwal and senior leader Manish Sisodia who, he alleged, “have accepted Rs 20 crore in exchange for the induction of Ram Singh Netaji who has been fielded from Badarpur seat.” Neither AAP, nor Netaji reacted to the allegations.Sharma told TOI he will contest as an independent while a couple of other MLAs who have been dropped said that they will seek the opinion of the people of their constituencies before taking a decision whether they should contest as independents or not. Some of the more bitter ones said that work had not been a criterion for dropping them.According to party sources, the tickets have been finalized in keeping with the outcome of multiple qualitative and quantitative surveys conducted in all assembly constituencies. AAP assessed performance, public connect and opinion, and winnability of each MLA through the surveys which were conducted by the party and private agencies.Seeking re-election in Delhi, AAP is pitching the performance of its government and its achievements to outmanoeuvre rivals BJP and Congress in a three-cornered contest. The elections are critical for AAP because it does not have a significant presence outside Delhi except in Punjab. It has devised a catchy slogan — ‘Achhe beete panch saal, lage raho Kejriwal’ — and a report card to woo voters.The pivot to AAP’s carefully crafted approach is Kejriwal, who has undergone a significant image transition in the past seven months. Known as an agitationist, Kejriwal has supported the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens from a distance. He has refrained from directly attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and refused to get drawn into debates over the Centre’s policies and issues. AAP has roped in political strategist Prashant Kishor’s consultancy firm, I-PAC, for the polls.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73258871,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-382856,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/23-new-faces-in-aaps-full-list-of-70-for-assembly-showdown/articleshow/73258863.cms
22,['15/01/2020'],india news: India plans more curbs as Malaysia PM talks tough,"NEW DELHI: After refined palm oil , the government is looking to further step up the heat on Malaysia with a plan to restrict the import of microprocessors amid indications that the trade dispute is unlikely to be sorted out soon as the Southeast Asian nation continues to rile India over Kashmir and the Citizenship (Amendment Act).Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad ’s determination to speak out on what India believes are its internal issues has seen the Modi government working on imposing technical standards on microprocessors and also putting in place a quality control order for telecom equipment, sources told TOI.Customs authorities have been asked to ensure compliance of the quality control order as part of efforts to restrict the entry of Malaysian equipment into India, in what is probably the first trade retaliation by India against a country’s political stance.On Tuesday, Mohamad said he was worried over the trade restrictions but added that he would continue to speak out against “wrong things”.“We are concerned, of course, because we sell a lot of palm oil to India, but, on the other hand, we need to be frank and see that if something goes wrong, we will have to say it,” the veteran leader told reporters in Kuala Lumpur .“If we allow things to go wrong and think only about the money involved, then I think a lot of wrong things will be done, by us and by other people,” he added.A news agency said the 94-year-old leader vowed to find a solution as prices crashed in the futures market after India, the world’s largest buyer of edible oil, decided to move refined palm oil from the list of free imports to the restricted category.Apart from Mohamad’s comments on Kashmir and CAA, Indian authorities are upset with Malaysia’s reluctance to extradite controversial preacher Zakir Naik , prompting the government to hit back on the trade front. On January 9, TOI had reported that India intended to step up action against Malaysia with restrictions on palm oil and electronics imports.Separately, the mines ministry is keeping tabs on imports and may initiate action in the coming weeks, officials said. Malaysian palm oil already faces 50% import tariff, due to a 5% safeguard duty, compared to 45% on Indonesian oil. The duty is up for review next month, sources said.India’s trade with Malaysia was estimated at over $17 billion, with exports pegged at $6.4 billion, while imports were estimated at $10.8 billion.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73259106,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-174418,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-plans-more-curbs-as-malaysia-pm-talks-tough/articleshow/73259108.cms

Cos expect rising UV sales trend to stay under BS-VI

CHENNAI: India’s newfound love for utility vehicles has taken the share of that segment from a mere 13% of total passenger vehicle sales nine years ago to more than one-third so far this fiscal.In 2010-11, the auto industry rolled out 78 new cars on Indian roads and 36 new UVs. So far in the current financial year, 53 new cars have been launched, and an equal number of UVs have been launched, according to data from industry body Siam.So sharp has the shift towards UVs been that the segment's overall share of the passenger vehicle pie has gone up from 27% in April-December 2018 to 34% in April-December 2019. UVs have also bucked the slowdown, with sales rising 6% to over 7.2 lakh units during April-December 2019. In contrast, car sales dropped 23.6%, while overall passenger vehicle sales fell 16.4% in this period, according to Siam data.“India is following a global trend where UVs are increasing their share of overall PV sales. This is because UVs have been evolving into multipurpose vehicles. They offer higher ground clearance, easier mobility on unpaved roads, more space for larger families and more engine power. There have been more UV launches than cars and that trend is global too. This shift should settle with UVs at around 45-50% of the PV market in 3-4 years,” said Siam president Rajan Wadhera.Industry players do not expect the trend to change even after the switchover to BS-VI from April.“UVs have already entered the sub-4 metre category where more gasoline SUVs are being sold than diesel. Post BS-VI, SUVs in the Rs 13-20 lakh range will still be largely diesel but the compact UV will be mostly gasoline,” said Wadhera, who is also the president of Mahindra’s auto division. Currently, diesel commands a 70% share of the UV market.Auto analysts say the increase in SUV sales has come at the expense of mid-size sedans. “With the compact SUV segment, the average price of SUVs has come down from Rs 15 lakh to less than Rs 10 lakh and so the customer who would earlier buy, say a Ciaz, City or Verna is now often buying an SUV,” said Ashish Modani, vice president at ratings agency ICRA.The popularity of the SUV is also reflecting on the used car market. Said Ashutosh Pandey, CEO, Mahindra First Choice Wheels: “In used vehicles too, UVs have a growing share, though it is lower at around 25%. This is so because a large number of vehicles sold in the used car market is old hatch and entry level models such as i10, Alto etc.” As hatch owners upgrade, supply of old hatch and entry cars have gone up in the used car pool.Currently the Siam classification of UV includes both larger chassis based vehicles like the Toyota Fortuner as well as compact monocoque vehicles like the Vitara Brezza. “In India the UV segment spans everything from larger SUVs to MPVs to crossovers but in the lower end the UVs are mostly car-like or monocoque whereas higher priced vehicles are both chassis built as well as monocoque,” said Modani.",auto,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73259291,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1489501,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//auto/cars/utility-vehicles-account-for-34-of-passenger-vehicle-sales/articleshow/73261591.cms

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand governor Baby Rani Maurya on Tuesday gave her assent to the Char Dham Devsthanam Management Bill 2019 and it would now pave way for the state government to take over of 50 shrines in the state, including Char Dham — Gangotri, Yamunotri , Kedarnath and Badrinath.

Officials at the governor secretariat confirmed the development and said that the Bill has been passed on to the state government’s law department for further discussion on the date of notification before implementation.

In the board, an IAS officer will hold the post of CEO while CM will be the president and there will be other members such as MLAs, MPs and member of the Tehri royal family. Sources said that the appointments in the board and a head office in Dehradun would be made in the next few months.

The board will bring Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri, Yamunotri and 51 other temples in the hill state under the ambit of the state government and will also result in the dismantling of the existing temple managements such as the Badri-Kedar Temple Committee. The provisions and composition of the Bill will be like the Vaishno Devi shrine board and Tirupati Balaji shrine board.

Meanwhile, local priests and Congress MLA from Kedarnath Manoj Rawat threatened to launch a protest against the Bill and said that it is against the interests of the priests’ community. Rawat said, “The state government is ruining the century-old Hindu traditions set up by Adi Shankaracharya for Char Dham. This government is doing something which even the British couldn’t do.”

Rawat added that unlike Vaishno Devi, Char Dham has everything in place. “From rituals to appointments and tenure of priests, everything is in place in Char Dham. The takeover will mean dismantling a perfect system that is in place. Why does the government even want that?”

Badrinath priest Ashutosh Semwal said, “Our community is opposed to the new board as it will undermine the existing system. We will soon hold a meeting of all priests to decide the next course of action.”

However, state government spokesperson and Haridwar MLA Madan Kaushik said that the system of head priests, which was set up by Adi Shankaracharya, will continue as it is. “The new board will not interfere in the daily operational affairs. It will just manage donations and the money would be used to develop the shrines.”

Two of the infants had been admitted there for around a fortnight. Two were in the general ward and the remaining two were in the special neonatal care unit (SNCU) and paediatric ICU of the hospital, say sources. All the babies were less that six-month old.

Three of the deaths happened in a span of four hours — at 6.50pm and 7.30pm. A fourth infant died at 3.30am on January 14 followed by another at 6am. The sixth death was at 7.50am.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Tuesday demanded that the government probe whether Jammu and Kashmir police officer Davinder Singh had any role in last year’s Pulwama terror attack, suggesting a political nexus, prompting BJP to hit back demanding that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi explain who was behind the attack if not Pakistan.

Singh was posted in Pulwama and Congress’s allegations take into account his name figuring in claims regarding the 2001 Parliament attack and he was also in the frame during the recent visit of foreign envoys to J&K.

With Congress claiming a “larger conspiracy”, BJP asked it to explain if it had doubts on who was behind the Pulwama terror attack. “I want to ask Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi if they have any doubt about perpetrators of the Pulwama attack. If you believe Pakistan was not behind it, then you should tell us clearly as to who were involved,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said.

Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury sought to target RSS and said, “Had Davinder Singh by default been Davindar Khan, the reaction of troll regiment of RSS would have been more strident and vociferous. Enemies of our country ought to be condemned, irrespective of colour, creed, and religion.”

Patra accused Congress of linking religion to terror attacks to target Hindus and said the party had a history of doing so. Congress leaders had invented terms like “saffron terror” and “Hindu terror” and had linked RSS to the Mumbai terror attacks, he said.

Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala said, “For how long has Davinder Singh been acting as a conduit for J&K terrorists? What is his connection, if at all, to the 2001 Parliament attack? What is his connection to the Pulwama attack where over 42 jawans lost their lives and where Singh was DSP?”

Congress dismissed the police claim that Singh was bringing two terrorists in his car to Delhi for Rs 12 lakh on January 11. “This story is preposterous. There is a larger conspiracy. At whose instance was Singh bringing terrorists to Delhi? Are there any people in echelons of power who are involved with him? Is there a larger conspiracy, is he only a small pawn or a carrier in the larger conspiracy?” Surjewala asked.

Rejecting the Congress charge, Patra said, “Congress is best at attacking India and defending and protecting Pakistan.” Pakistani PM Imran Khan and LeT chief Hafiz Saeed would soon be praising Congress for its statements, he said, recalling that Pakistan had used Rahul’s remarks in its plea in the UN on Article 370 .

30,['15/01/2020'],WPI inflation jumps to 7-month high of 2.6% In December,"NEW DELHI: Wholesale price inflation shot up to a seven-month high in December, largely led by a huge spike in onion prices, vegetable and food prices and making it tough for RBI to lower interest rates.Official data released on Tuesday showed inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), rose an annual 2.6% in December from 0.6% in previous month but lower than 3.5% rate in the corresponding month of 2018.Food inflation soared by 13.2%, driven by a 456% rise in prices of onions. Vegetable prices shot up by an annual 70% during the month, while potato prices rose 45%.The movement in WPI mirrored retail inflation data released on Monday, which rose to a five-and a half-year high of 7.4% in December led by a sharp spike in food prices. Food inflation under consumer price inflation increased by 14%, highest in nearly six-years.Sharp rise in inflation has come at a time when growth is estimated to slow to an 11-year low of 5% in the current fiscal year. Economists said the sharp increase in inflation rates will complicate the policy choice for the central bank, which will now continue with its pause on interest rates.Experts expect prices of vegetables to moderate in the months ahead as supplies improve and all eyes are now on the February 1 Budget for measures to boost overall growth.“Encouragingly, the sequential contraction in vegetables and protein complex seen in WPI should spill over to retail inflation with a lag. We see WPI inflation remaining range-bound in near-term and moderate to 1.8% in FY20, largely led by significant correction in core WPI inflation. However, with recent CPI inflation at 7.4% and looking to remain above RBI’s tolerance range in near-term, MPC ( monetary policy committee ) may find it difficult to ignore the inflation outlook even as it may see vegetables price shock transient,” said Madhavi Arora, lead economist, Edelweiss Securities.“It deepens the policy dilemma, amid overshooting inflation, undershooting growth and fragile fiscal state. We think conventional monetary accommodation still has further steam of another ~50bps in this rate cut cycle, admittedly contingent on evolution of inflation, amid various domestic and global idiosyncrasies. Nonetheless the timing of same is a tad tricky. But for now, February cut seems to be ruled out,” said Arora.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73259940,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-379062,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wpi-inflation-jumps-to-7-mh-high-of-2-6-in-december/articleshow/73259941.cms

An Indian warship testing the Barak missile.

NEW DELHI: The Cabinet Committee on Security has cleared a deadly weapons and sensors package for the four guided-missile destroyers under construction at Mazagon Docks in Mumbai, which will take the overall project cost of the four stealth warships to around Rs 35,800 crore.

Sources said the CCS last week cleared the over Rs 6,150 crore acquisition cost of a wide range of advanced weapon systems and sensors for the four 7,300-tonne destroyers being constructed under ‘Project-15B’. The first of the destroyers, INS Visakhapatnam , is likely to be commissioned in 2021-2022 after some delay. It will be followed by her sister warships, INS Mormugao and INS Imphal, while the fourth is yet to be named.

All four will be armed with precision-strike BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles as well as the next-generation Barak surface-to-air missile systems, among other weapons like 127 mm main guns and rocket launchers. While BrahMos has been developed jointly with Russia, the Barak-NG is a collaboration between Israeli Aerospace Industries-Rafael and the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation.

“While the Rs 29,644-crore fixed cost component for construction of the destroyers was inked in 2011, the variable cost component, which includes the weapons and sensors, has now been cleared by the CCS,” a source said.

The stealth destroyers, which will be propelled by four gas turbines to achieve speeds of over 30 knots, will pack a formidable punch. With their weapons and sensors, like the vertically launched missile systems and MF-STARs (multi-function surveillance and threat alert radars), the warships will be capable of long-distance engagement of shore, sea-based and air targets.

The interception range of the supersonic Barak-NG missile systems, for instance, has been increased from the earlier 70 km to around 100 km to provide an all-weather ‘defence shield’ against incoming enemy fighters, drones, helicopters, missiles and other munitions. The strike range of the 290-km BrahMos is also now being extended, as earlier reported by TOI.

The destroyers, which span 163 metres in length and 17.4 metres at the beam, have been indigenously designed and constructed. The P-15B destroyers, each of which can carry two multi-role helicopters, incorporate cutting-edge design concepts for improved survivability, sea-keeping stealth and manoeuvrability.

Once these warships are commissioned, they will join the ranks of operational destroyers named INS Delhi, INS Mumbai, INS Mysore, INS Kolkata, INS Kochi and INS Chennai. The naval tradition is to name indigenously constructed destroyers, which are second only to aircraft carriers in size and combat power, after a state capital or big city.

The Navy has a force level of 125 warships as well as 15 diesel-electric and two nuclear submarines, along with around 235 aircraft, helicopters and drones, to guard India’s strategic interests from the Persian Gulf to Malacca Strait as well as deter Pakistan and counter China’s expanding footprint in the Indian Ocean Region. The force also has 48 warships under construction in India, including aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, four Scorpene submarines and the four destroyers, while it will also get two frigates from Russia.

33,['15/01/2020'],Nirbhaya case: SC rejects curative plea of two condemned convicts,"This story is from January 15, 2020

NEW DELHI: Nirbhaya case condemned prisoners Vinay Sharma and Mukesh Kumar inched closer to the gallows as the Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed their curative petitions, the last judicial recourse to challenge capital punishment awarded to them, and refused to stay their execution scheduled for January 22.

A bench of Justices N V Ramana, Arun Mishra, R F Nariman, R Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan considered the duo’s curative petition in chamber in the absence of lawyers, as mandated under the procedure for hearing curative petitions, and said, “The applications for oral hearing (open court hearing) are rejected. The applications for stay of death sentence are also rejected.

“We have gone through the curative petitions and the relevant documents. In our opinion, no case is made out within the parameters indicated in the decisions of this court in Rupa Ashok Hurra vs Ashok Hurra & Another, reported in 2002 (4) SCC 388. Hence, the curative petitions are dismissed.”

Dismissal of the curative petitions by Vinay and Mukesh makes it futile for the other two condemned prisoners, Pawan Gupta and Akshay Singh, to move the SC with similar pleas. The only recourse available to the four death row prisoners is to petition the President seeking mercy. Mukesh, in fact, filed a mercy plea with the President later in the day.

President Ram Nath Kovind , while speaking at an event in Rajasthan on December 6 last year, had conveyed his strong stance against mercy pleas and said there should be no such provision for child rapists. “Women’s safety is a serious issue. Rape convicts under the Pocso Act should not have right to file mercy petition. Parliament should review mercy petitions,” Kovind had said in Sirohi .

There was also some confusion last month over one of the convicts Vinay filing a mercy plea with the President. A few days after the home ministry forwarded to the President the recommendation of Delhi government rejecting Vinay’s mercy plea, the convict wrote to Kovind saying the petition was sent “without his authorisation” and sought its withdrawal.

The four were awarded capital punishment by the trial court, which the Delhi high court and the SC upheld, for the barbaric sexual assault on a 23-year-old paramedic inside a moving bus leading to her death. One of the accused, Ram Singh, committed suicide in jail during the trial. A juvenile in conflict with the law in this case was tried by a special court and has already served three years in a reform home for juveniles.

On December 18 last year, the SC had dismissed Akshay’s petition seeking review of its May 5, 2017, decision upholding death penalty to him. The review petitions of the other three — Mukesh, Vinay and Pawan — were dismissed by the SC on July 9, 2018.

In the five-judge bench headed by Justice Ramana which dismissed the curative petition on Tuesday, only Justices Banumathi and Bhushan were part of the bench that had heard the convicts’ appeals challenging the Delhi HC verdict. The hearing had gone on for 38 days and on May 5, 2017, the SC had upheld the death sentence to them. Justices Banumathi and Bhushan were also part of the bench that had dismissed the review petitions on July 9, 2018.

As per rules, the review petitions of Mukesh, Vinay and Pawan were heard in open court by a three-judge bench. Dismissing the review petitions, Justice Bhushan had on July 9 said, “In these review petitions, no ground has been made out which may furnish any ground to review the judgment, We, thus, find no merit in these review petitions and consequently, the review petitions are dismissed.”

Nirbhaya, a 23-year-old paramedic, while returning home along with her friend after watching a film on the night of December 16, 2012, was brutally assaulted and gang-raped in a moving bus in south Delhi and thrown out of the vehicle. Though her tormentors had given her up for dead, she survived for nearly a fortnight before succumbing to her injuries on December 29 in a Singapore hospital where she was flown by the government.

Captain Tania Shergill, who represents the fourth-generation in her family to serve in the military, will lead the marching contingent at the Army Day parade in Delhi on Wednesday.

She will also lead the Army’s contingent during the Republic Day parade on January 26. This, of course, is not the first time that women officers have led marching contingents in the R-Day parade.

In 2015, the Army, Navy and IAF had even fielded all-women marching contingents for the first time on PM Modi’s directive that “Naari Shakti” should be the predominant theme of the R-Day parade.

But what is certainly unique about Capt Shergill, who hails from Hoshiarpur and has a B.Tech degree in electronics and communications, is that her father was from the Artillery Regiment, grandfather from the Armoured Corps and great grandfather from the Sikh Regiment in the infantry.

MUMBAI: UV Asset Reconstruction Company has emerged the highest bidder for Reliance communication and Reliance Telecom (RTL) including real estate assets, eneterprise and data centre business with a bid of a little over Rs 16,000 crore. Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio is understood to have emerged the highest bidder for Anil Ambani ’s telecom infra firm Reliance Infratel with an offer of Rs 3609 crore.

Reliance Communication, once a flagship company of Anil Ambani group, received bids from Bharti Airtel and alternate investment firm Varde Partners in addition to UV Asset Reconstruction. Banking sources said that UVARC’s bid was the highest. Bharti Airtel and UVARCL had also bid for Reliance Infratel.

Although Reliance Communications is non-operational and has lost most of its customers for good, the winning bidders will have access to the company’s assets which include airwaves in the 850 MHz band in 14 of India’s 22 telecom circles, Infratel has about 43,000 telecom towers, some fibre and data centre

According to banking industry sources, this is not a done deal as yet. Lenders expect the department of telecom to throw a spanner in the works by pressing for repayment of its dues. This is going by their experience with bankrupt telecom operator Aircel where DoT is challenging a deal cleared by lenders.

Bankers also said that the RCom resolution is a complex affair as there are a lot of conditionalities involved with every asset of the company. The meeting of the committee of creditors which started last weekend has continued until late on Monday.

Lenders had sought the help of Dun & Bradstreet for a feasibility report while SBI Caps appraised the financial bids. A large chunk of UV ARC’s repayment to creditors is understood to be spread over seven years linked to recoveries from sale of RComs assets.

The resolution profession Anish Nanavati had verified claims of Rs 31,788 crore of financial creditors and an additional Rs 22,455 crore from department of telecom. In the case of RTL, loans of Rs 35,192 crore and DoT’s Rs 2,073 crore have been verified. Reliance Infratel has received claims of Rs 36,195 crore. The bid amounts are lower than the 20-25% recoveries that lenders were anticipating through the bankruptcy process.

Where is the violence? Who says you cannot protest... have you read the Constitution? You are behaving as if Jama Masjid was Pakistan and even if it was Pakistan, you can go there and protest. Pakistan was a part of undivided India,” ASJ Lau remarked when police cited social media posts of the Bhim Army chief urging people to come to Jama Masjid for a dharna (sit-in protest).“Inside Parliament, things which should have been said were not said and that is why people are out on the streets. We have full right to express our views but we cannot destroy our country. We cannot disintegrate it,” the court added.The court’s acerbic comments came after the prosecutor opposed the bail plea claiming Azad gave inflammatory speeches at Jama Masjid, inciting the gathering to carry out violent protests in the area against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.Lau also asked the investigating officer in the case to put on record all the evidence which showed that Azad was giving “incriminatory” speeches at Jama Masjid, and any law which said that the gathering was unconstitutional.During the hearing the judge again rapped the prosecution when it argued that permission must be taken to hold such protests.“What permission? Even the Supreme Court has said repeated use of Section 144 (prohibition of gathering of five or more persons, holding of public meetings, and carrying of firearms) of the Indian Penal Code was an abuse of the law. I have seen many people and many such cases, where protests happened even outside Parliament. Many of them are chief ministers now. Azad is a budding politician, what is wrong with his protests?” the court demanded to know.It also took a dim view of the admission by police that they only had footage from a drone camera but no other video or audio recording linking Azad to the incident, except statements of witnesses. Wondering if Delhi police is so backward that it has no tools to record, the court posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday.Advocate Mehmood Pracha, representing Azad, alleged that his client is suffering from polycythemia, a blood disorder, for which he was not given proper treatment by the Tihar Jail authorities till a magistrate court had directed them for the same.“He was actually reading the Constitution.

Researchers in the US have built the first ever “living robot”, or xenobot, by engineering bits of frog embryo to behave like “living, programmable organisms,” an advance that may lead to computer-designed “life forms” capable of delivering drugs into the human body, clean up radioactive waste, collect microplastics in the oceans or even scrape out plaque from human arteries.These millimetre-wide bots were designed by stitching together two different cell types from a frog embryo in specific ways so that they could move towards a target on their own and carry out tasks, the study, published in the journal PNAS, noted.“These are novel living machines. They’re neither a traditional robot nor a known species of animal. It's a new class of artifact: a living, programmable organism,” said study co-author Joshua Bongard, a computer scientist and robotics expert at the University of Vermont in the US.The bots were also engineered to pick up a payload — such as a medicine that needs to be carried to a specific place inside a patient — and could heal themselves after being cut, according to the researchers.For creating the xenobots, the scientists developed a complex algorithm that could self-learn and evolve to create thousands of candidate designs for the new life-forms. The algorithm reassembled a few hundred simulated cells into myriad forms and body shapes, over and over, in an attempt to achieve a task assigned by the scientists — such as locomotion in one direction.This “harnessing” of living cells, which sounds like something out of a dystopian sci-fi movie, has raised several ethical questions. Some experts warned about the potential danger from these bots if they go out of control. Others pointed out that the scientists were getting uncomfortably close to playing god.The paper said the bots may lead to novel machines in a wide range of fields like detecting toxic contamination in the environment, gathering microplastic in the oceans and also scrapping out blocks in blood vessels. Unlike traditional robots, the researchers said xenobots could theoretically accomplish these feats without polluting the planet.The bots were named after the species of African frogs, Xenopus laevis, whose embryonic cells, or stem cells the research team gathered for the project.The bots ran on basic rules about the physics of what single frog skin, and cardiac cells can do. The researchers said that the computer, after 100 independent runs of the algorithm, selected the most promising designs for testing. They then transferred the computer designs into life.The scientists separated these into single cells and left them to incubate. These cells were then individually cut using tiny forceps, and an even tinier electrode, and joined under a microscope into a close approximation of the designs specified by the computer, the researchers said.The joined cells, came together into body forms never seen in nature, and began to work in unison, they added. According to the scientists, the skin cells formed a more passive architecture, while the once-random contractions of heart muscle cells created an ordered forward movement which was guided by the computer's design, and by spontaneous self-organising patterns.These responses of the different cells allowed the xenobots to move on their own, the study said. According to the researchers, the bots were able move in a coherent fashion — and explore their watery environment for days or weeks.They also found that groups of xenobots can move around in circles, pushing pellets into a central location, spontaneously and collectively. Some of the bots were built with a hole through the centre to reduce air resistance, or drag.The scientists could also create simulated versions in which this hole was repurposed as a pouch to successfully carry an object.“It's a step toward using computer-designed organisms for intelligent drug delivery,” Bongard said.The xenobots also fall apart harmlessly, the University of Vermont scientist said. “The xenobots are fully biodegradable. When they're done with their job after seven days, they're just dead skin cells,"" he said.In Video: US scientists create the world's first-ever 'living robots'",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73262770,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-56436,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/science/meet-xenobots-worlds-first-ever-living-robots/articleshow/73260339.cms

41,['15/01/2020'],You need 5 healthy habits at 50 to add a decade of disease-free life,"This story is from January 15, 2020

NEW DELHI: Sticking to just five healthy habits when you are 50 — a healthy diet, exercising regularly, not being overweight, not drinking too much alcohol and not smoking – can earn you an extra decade of life free of chronic diseases like cancer, heart and Type 2 diabetes, says a new study particularly relevant to Indians.

While many studies in the past have highlighted the role of healthy lifestyle in improving overall life expectancy and reduction of chronic disease risks, the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health study assumes significance as it looks at how a combination of lifestyle factors may relate to life expectancy free from such diseases, health experts said. The study was published in the BMJ.

Findings show significant benefits for women who maintained four or five of the healthy lifestyle factors at age 50 with 10.6 years of longer life expectancy free of major chronic diseases than those who did not maintain such a regimen. Men gained 7.6 years longer life expectancy. Men who smoked heavily (15 or more cigarettes a day), and men and women with obesity having body mass index of 30 or more, had the lowest proportion (75% or less) of disease-free life expectancy at age 50. “This study has great relevance to Indians, who often pursue unhealthy habits from early life, and who are seeing chronic disease like diabetes occurring in 20s and 30s. However, I would differ slightly about advice of moderate alcohol intake, which should be minimised given unhealthy livers of Indians,” says Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis C-Doc.

Doctors say all the five lifestyle factors contribute hugely in controlling diabetes, blood pressure and lipids or cholesterol and by maintaining a healthy lifestyle from the start – at the age of 30-35 years – one can reduce the risk of hypertension, diabetes and other chronic diseases, including cancer.

“Life expectancy of Indians has increased but it is not much free of diseases and therefore, this study is very important. Though current generations, particularly women, are now becoming increasing cautious of their lifestyle, it is important to pay attention to these five factors as they can control all the key risk factors – lipid, insulin, obesity, blood pressure – and help improve life expectancy and reduce disease burden,” says Dr J P S Sawhney, senior cardiologist, Ganga Ram Hospital. Researchers analysed 34 years of data from 73,196 women and 28 years of data from 38,366 men participating in, respectively, the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.

India has seen an accelerated rise in prevalence of non-communicable diseases, mainly diabetes, cancer and hypertension. According to the National Health Profile (NHP), 2019, of 6.51 crore people diagnosed at government NCD clinics during 2018, over 40 lakh were detected with hypertension, more than 31 lakh with diabetes, whereas over 11 lakh people were suffering from both hypertension and diabetes. Besides, another around 2 lakh were diagnosed for other cardiovascular diseases and 1.68 lakh with common cancers like oral, breast and cervix.

NEW DELHI: The Kerala government on Tuesday challenged the validity of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) under Article 131, making it a Centre-state dispute, and termed the CAA unconstitutional for denying Indian citizenship to Muslims, Rohingyas, Hazaras , Tamils and even minorities, such as Indian-origin people from Fiji and Malaysia.The Kerala government said the assembly had on December 31, 2019, passed a resolution requesting the Centre to “abrogate CAA” and requested the Supreme Court to scrap the law as otherwise the state was bound under Article 256 of the Constitution to implement its “arbitrary, unreasonable and irrational” provisions.The law provides a path to citizenship for Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Jain, Parsi and Buddhist minorities who fled Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh due to religious persecution and entered India by December 31, 2014.This is the second time in the last 60 years that a state government has moved the apex court resisting implementation of a Parliament-enacted law. In 1961, the West Bengal government had moved a suit in the court under Article 131 against Parliament passing the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957, which had empowered the Centre to acquire land vested or owned by the state government.The court had then ruled that “upon proper interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act, it was clear that the Act applied also to coal bearing areas vested in or owned by the state”, upholding a crucial constitutional edge enjoyed by the Centre to legislate for acquiring state-owned property. Article 131 gives the SC the exclusive jurisdiction to decide suits relating to Centre-state and state-state disputes.Apart from neighbouring countries, the Kerala government asked why the CAA did not cover ethnic Indians in Malaysia and Fiji. It said, “The impugned amendment Act and Rules and Passport Orders further overlooked the issues of ethnic Indians in Malaysia and Fiji. The Indian diaspora in Malaysia and Fiji are descendants of those Indians who migrated there in search of work or were brought there as indentured labourers when those were British colonies.”The state said the CAA overlooked the issues of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and Muslims in Sri Lanka, who are minuscule minorities in those countries. The CAA also did not consider “Hindus, primarily of Tamil descent in Sri Lanka, and Hindu Madhesis in Terai of Nepal, Christians of Bhutan and Sri Lanka and Buddhists from Nepal” for citizenship, it said.It went on to say that the CAA did not cover “the ethnic issues of Balochs, Sindhis, Pakhthuns and Mohajirs in Pakistan and Biharis in Bangladesh”. “The Biharis of Bangladesh and Mohajirs of Pakistan form part of millions of citizens of undivided India belonging to various faiths who were staying in the said areas of Pakistan and Bangladesh when India was partitioned in 1947,” the Left Front government said.It further said the CAA did not promise citizenship to “Hazaras, reportedly persecuted and repeatedly attempted to be cleansed on the ground of their ethnicity, in Afghanistan. Further, the CAA does not cover the ethnic and linguistic issues of Tamils in Sri Lanka”.The plea, without articulating how the CAA became a Centre-state dispute, said since the Act was “manifestly arbitrary and unconstitutional” as it violated secularism and right to equality, “thus, there exists a dispute involving questions of law and facts between the state of Kerala and the Union of India, regarding the enforcement of legal rights as a state and as well as for the enforcement of fundamental, statutory, constitutional and other legal rights of the inhabitants of the state of Kerala”.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73260472,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-233723,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/making-caa-centre-state-dispute-kerala-moves-sc/articleshow/73260461.cms

PATNA: Perhaps with an eye on assembly elections scheduled in the state in October-November this year, RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s younger son and leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has decided to hold a three-day ‘Pratirodh Sabha’ in Muslim-dominated Seemanchal region from January 16 in protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

Tejashwi will start his anti-CAA, NRC and NPR campaign from Kishanganj. He will hold public meetings in Araria and Katihar on January 17 and 18, respectively.

Meanwhile, Tejashwi also met the anti-CAA protesters at Shanti Bagh in Gaya on Tuesday.

Asked about the reason for selecting Muslim-dominated region for his public meetings, Tejashwi said, “It is not about any particular religion. I am going to different places on the request of people.”

“What the central government is doing is anti-Constitution and anti-people. There is confusion everywhere and I will meet people and discuss the issues. PM Narendra Modi speaks opposite to what home minister Amit Shah announces. Even in JD(U), there are two blocks,” he added.

Tejashwi said CM Nitish Kumar was making people fool by calling for a discussion on CAA as his party had supported it in the Parliament. “Nitish should stop the NPR exercise in the state. Shah has already said that NPR is a first step towards implementation of NRC in the country. Additional questions are being asked in NPR exercise. It shows the government’s true intention,” Tejashwi said.

GAYA: Amid controversy over introduction of Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the country, Buddhist spiritual leader the Dalai Lama on Tuesday lauded India for its tolerance and pluralism. Addressing the IIM-Bodh Gaya students and faculty members, the spiritual leader said India offered a living example of how different cultures and religions could exist together in perfect harmony.

Giving tips to aspiring business leaders, Dalai Lama regretted that though everyone seeks happiness, little real effort is made in this direction. “We are the creators of our own problems. War did not offer any solution to our problems and we have to see to it that the vagaries of the 20th century wars do not revisit us in this century,” the spiritual leader said.

He added that education played a crucial role in shaping human personality and its proper orientation. The spiritual leader also released the institute’s logo. The logo has been designed by Chandrashekhar Sasawade of National Institute of Design, Bangalore.

At the IIM campus, Dalai Lama was received by the institute’s director Vinita Sahay. The spiritual leader also planted a ‘peepal’ sapling on the campus.

45,['15/01/2020'],Allow employees to question without fear of retaliation,"This story is from January 15, 2020

By Prabir Jha

Safety is a growing priority for most companies across sectors today. And this is so reassuring to see. However, much of their definition is still the classical definition of safety — physical, products, processes, systems and equipment. But what unfortunately is still missing in many places is the appreciation and practice of psychological safety.

In my advisory experience, I witness various organisational challenges that leadership teams identify — lack of agility, unwillingness to take risks, dry leadership pipeline, low trust, subdued innovation, poor work culture, team dysfunctionalities, to name a few.

And often, as one peels the onion, one sees a common underlying issue. It is the absence of psychological safety where employees just do not feel assured enough to express themselves. They are reluctant to suggest ideas, share their anxieties or question leadership thinking. This, despite the standard formats of town halls, suggestion boxes and small group activities.

‘Niti’ (rituals) do not substitute for ‘Niyat’ (intent). Unfortunately, the fuzziness of understanding the issue of psychological safety is often not an adequately developed leadership strength. Most leadership growth over years has been about brute numbers, directive activity and a lone ranger-ship mindset. And suddenly, one is responsible for larger teams and their engagement to deliver strategic outcomes.

This is not something that they were consciously prepared for, and many struggle and fail.

How then could you enhance psychological safety in your organisation? I have simple tips:

Make it a mainstream narrative: Unless you call out this licence, your employees and other stakeholders will not even know it is an option, or even a desired behaviour. Explain the contours of this concept through simple illustrations. Every communication platform must highlight this. This must become an underlying tenet of your operating culture. Equally, clarify what cannot be construed as included in psychological safety. The best example: A bona fide mistake is fine, but wilful negligence is not an alibi.

Practice psychological safety to its fullest: I advise companies to discourage anonymous questions and whistleblowing to the extent they can. People should be able to lend their names to their questions without fear of retaliation. Admitting management slips and omissions is an act of vulnerability that can be role models for psychological safety. The top management must demonstrate this each time. And soon, the culture starts trickling down. The guarantee of psychological safety must come right from the top.

Rewire all your people practices to reinforce psychological safety: Who we hire, promote, reward and celebrate reinforces most significantly the culture of a workplace. Companies must signal through all their HR interventions that they endorse managers who encourage plurality of ideas, respect difference of opinion and invite contrarian points of view. They must spot and amplify leaders and individuals who speak up their suggestions, concerns and constructive criticism. In my own experience, this is the toughest one to do. But if you do practise this, the institutional culture is more vibrant, innovative and engaging than one can imagine.

Invest in coaching for building psychological safety: Like every leadership skill, this too needs conscious investment. Many companies realise this need only when people are already prisoners of their success and behaviour. Help younger managers to know how to deal with this subject. Train them in the art of conversations that counts, beyond just tasks. Teach them to appreciate human psychology so that they understand how their little leadership acts impair psychological safety in their teams.

Measure the state of psychological safety in your organisation: Firms must regularly seek to measure — both quantitatively and qualitatively — the state of the nation. A young HRpreneur recently shared with me a platform that measures in real time organisational dynamics that could help intervene and coach for improving the environment. Such smart tools are there to leverage, provided we realise the strategic risks that a lack of psychological safety poses to an enterprise, beyond just a feel-good.

In the emergent chaos and uncertainty of our times, no past can predict the future. No grey hair can underwrite the script for tomorrow. Our people must want to feel free to ideate, own, critique and improve their individual and collective outcome. This cannot be mandated or commanded. It has to be nursed and earned. Build not just physically safe workplaces but also, importantly, nurture psychologically safe ones.

CM Nitish Kumar would inaugurate the two-day conference, which will be attended by CPCB chairman SP Singh Parihar, principal secretary of ministry of environment, forest and climate change CK Mishra, chairman and secretary members of 28 state pollution boards and pollution control committees from eight union territories. Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi will also attend the event.

Principal secretary of state environment, forest and climate change department said on Tuesday that environment experts from across the country would prepare a recommendation policy based on the discussions.

Singh at a presser said one inaugural session and seven technical sessions will be held during the two-day event. “Discussion will be held on solid and plastic waste management and biomedical waste on the first day while experts will deliberate on water quality assessment, industrial pollution and air quality action plans in apportioned cities on the second day of the conference,” he said.

BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh said a technical session on case study on air quality management would take place on the concluding day. “The state government would throw light on its ambitious ‘Jal Jeevan Hariyali’ scheme. Based on these discussions, a recommendation policy would be prepared by the CPCB to curb pollution,” he said.

Ghosh said Bihar would host the conference for the second time and first time after its bifurcation in 2000. Earlier in 1992, the conference was held in undivided Bihar.

Chairing a meeting to review the preparations for the human chain, Nitish asked the officials to ensure that the map shows connectivity of all routes in all districts and people should stand in their respective areas only.

The CM also asked the officials concerned to ensure safety of people standing in the human chain on the national highways and strict patrolling on all routes. He asked the officials to take all necessary precautions to ensure well-being of people in view of the prevailing biting cold conditions in the state. The CM said video-recording of people as well as the routes should be done using drones and motorcycles.

Additional chief secretary of education department R K Mahajan made a detailed presentation on the preparations done till date for the human chain. Various divisional commissioners, district magistrates, DIGs and other senior officials were also connected to the CM secretariat for the meeting.

Mahajan said human chain with Gandhi Maidan in Patna as its epicentre is proposed to be 16,351km long, with its branches touching the state’s boundaries in all four directions. The length of the main route will be 5,052km.

Mahajan said with an estimated number of 2,000 people per kilometre and 100 people in each ward, the total number of human chain participants would touch 4.27 crore. The participants will include students of government and private schools, teachers, government employees, cooks, Jeevika Didis, Asha workers and common people.

Mahajan said that all schools will remain open despite being Sunday and students of classes I to IV will make the human chain on the premises of the school only. He said spots are being marked on the left side of the routes of the human chain, where people can stand.

(File photo)

MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India’s ( RBI ’s) monetary policy committee (MPC) is likely to hold a consultation before its next bimonthly meet in February, given the surge in inflation beyond the panel’s tolerance level of 6%. While the MPC is unlikely to hike rates, the much-anticipated cut in February 2020 might not be forthcoming.

Economists are revising their earlier views of a rate cut in the RBI’s February 2020 policy and many now believe that the central bank will hold rates. The central government has notified in the official gazette 4% consumer price index (CPI) inflation as the target for the period from August 5, 2016 to March 31, 2021 with the upper tolerance limit of 6% and the lower tolerance limit of 2%. If inflation stays above the tolerance level, the MPC must take action. Although the MPC is mandated to meet at least four times, it can hold meetings more frequently.

“December CPI inflation rose sharply to 7.4%, the highest in more than five years. This was also higher than 6.8% expected by HSBC. Previously, we were calling for a 25-basis-point (100bps = 1 percentage point) rate cut in February, which we are now taking off the table,” HSBC India chief economist Pranjul Bhandari said in a report.

“CPI inflation jumped to 7.35% in December on the back of a significant increase in ginger, onion and potato (GOP) prices. Stripping aside the GOP impact, the headline inflation declines to 4.48%. The impact of increase in telecom tariff has added another 16bps to inflation. We now expect inflation to breach 8% in January and then start bottoming out,” said SBI chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh.

“We believe the RBI missed the bus in cutting rates in December. Our worry is that if the food price inflation does not mean revert, we can slip into stagflation. Our inflation trajectory shows headline will only materially decline beyond September, with December 2020-January 2021 inflation declining to below 3%,” added Ghosh.

PATNA: Altogether 745 vehicle owners and drivers were issued e-challans and fined Rs7.85 lakh for violating traffic norms as the transport department along with traffic police launched a special drive to enforce the helmet and seatbelt rules in the state capital on Tuesday. The drive was conducted under the 31st National Road Safety Week .

The vehicle owners and drivers were fined for violating traffic norms such as driving without helmet, seatbelt, pollution certificate, using tinted glasses and not possessing the required documents. The drive was conducted near Hartali Mor, Dak Bunglow roundabout and Kargil Chowk.

Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal distributed 20 free helmets to women riders as well as the pillion riders near Hartali Mor and encouraged them to wear helmet while riding two-wheelers. “Not only the driver’s but also the pillion rider’s life is at risk without helmet. We want to create awareness that the Motor Vehicles Act mandates a pillion rider also to wear helmet,” he said.

Agarwal, who is also the Patna divisional commissioner, said through the weeklong special drive has been launched to send message among public to wear helmets and seatbelts. “Those caught for violating the Act for more than two reasons were sent to Sultan Palace for corrective classes conducted by the experts of Aurangabad’s Institute of Driving Training and Traffic Research (IDTR),” he said.

During vehicle checking, the commissioner caught one Mohd Shamim Khan, who was talking on mobile while driving a two-wheeler without a helmet. The bike had an extra silencer, which was creating noise. Agarwal directed traffic SP D Amarkesh to seize the vehicle and impose a fine.

Another two-wheeler belonging to one Uday Singh was seized as the rider was neither wearing helmet, nor had a pollution under control certificate and vehicle papers. The driving licence of both the riders were suspended for three months and they were directed to attend the corrective classes at Sultan Palace.

Meanwhile, state transport minister Santosh Kumar Nirala launched the corrective classes at Sultan Palace for the traffic violators. Around 20 traffic violators attended the class on first day.

PATNA: Unidentified bike-borne criminals shot dead a farmer while he was working in his field at Supanchak under Fatuha police station area in eastern Patna on Tuesday evening. The deceased was identified as Jagdeo Yadav (55). Four empty cartridges were recovered from the spot.

Fatuha SDPO Maneesh said the family members of the deceased have accused co-villagers Umesh Yadav and Pintu Yadav of killing Jagdeo. “Pintu is a hardcore criminal and is on bail. Raids are being conducted to nab the duo,” he said.

Maneesh said Jagdeo was also the prime accused in a murder case lodged with Fatuha police station in 2014. “A close relative of Umesh was killed over land dispute ,” he said.

“However, police found Jagdeo innocent during investigation. However, Umesh’s family suspected that police had somehow connived with Jagdeo and set him free,” the SDPO said, adding that the two families have an old land dispute .

Quoting villagers, Maneesh said four criminals on two bikes reached Jagdeo’s field and shot him dead. “They fired several rounds. The bullets hit Jagdeo in his head, shoulder and waist. But only the postmortem report would confirm about the bullet marks,” he said.

52,['15/01/2020'],Bihar: Amit Shah’s Vaishali meeting likely to kick-start BJP’s poll preparation,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Amit Shah

PATNA: The proposed public meeting of BJP national president and Union home minister Amit Shah at Kharauna Pokhar near Vaishali Garh in Vaishali district on January 16 is set to generate political heat in the state.

Though Shah’s meeting is meant to clear the mist over the controversy on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and elaborate its significance in the larger interest of the country, speculations are rife that he would kick-start the party’s preparations for the assembly polls due later this year.

Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai and state BJP president Dr Sanjay Jaisawal besides the party’s organizational general secretary Nagendra Ji visited the meeting venue on Monday and took stock of the preparations. Significantly, LJP MP from Vaishali Veena Devi was seen seeking blessings of the people of her constituency to make the meeting a grand success, while JD(U) leaders of the district were maintaining a distance from it. Veena also took part in a meeting attended by senior BJP leaders at Hajipur, the district headquarters of Vaishali, a couple of days back.

The ideological differences among the JD(U) leaders on the CAA and proposed NRC have given credence to the belief that Shah’s speech would be loaded with political message both to the coalition partners in the state and to the party workers ahead of assembly polls in the state.

The meeting is equally important for Nityanand Rai, who till recently was state president of BJP and is considered a prominent Yadav face in the organization. He belongs to Hajipur and had earlier represented the constituency in the state assembly before being elected as MP from Ujiarpur Lok Sabha seat in 2014 and also in 2019. “Nityanand ji will not miss the opportunity to prove his strength on the occasion,” said a BJP leader.

The selection of the venue also matters for the party. Considered the cradle of the first democratic set up the world over, Vaishali Garh has a major chunk of Muslim population and also from backward classes. Shah might have been made aware of these things before finalizing the meeting venue, BJP sources said.

BJP’s Vaishali unit general secretary Manish Shukla said a public campaign was launched in the villages. On Monday, Nityanand and Dr Jaiswal addressed public gathering at Mansoorchak, Bhagwanpur Ratti and Daudnagar in Vaishali assembly segment.

He said the party leaders of both Vaishali and Muzaffarpur districts have been assigned the task to invite people for the public meeting. “It will be a historic meeting,” Shukla claimed.

Vaishali district administration has also made elaborate security arrangements for the meeting. “The meeting of the coordination committee of the local police and also from Delhi police was held to chalk out strategy for the security arrangements. “We have requisitioned additional police force from the police headquarters for the purpose,” Vaishali SP Guarav Mangla told this newspaper on Tuesday.

PATNA: RJD , LJP and HAM (S) have decided to contest the Delhi assembly elections scheduled for February 8. BJP ally LJP announced on Tuesday that it will contest all the 70 Delhi seats and released its first list of 15 candidates.

RJD’s Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha also said his party will field candidates in alliance with Congress but only if they get respectable number of seats. “Otherwise, we will go solo,” he said. Jha told TOI on Tuesday that they have demanded seven seats from Congress. “Talks are going on in this regard. It was our party only which spoke clearly against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the Rajya Sabha as these issues are not only against the minority community, but also against the poor who look to us,” said Jha.

LJP’s Delhi incharge Kali Pandey told reporters on Tuesday that the party released its first list of 15 candidates for Delhi polls. “Our alliance with BJP is limited to Bihar only and it was for the BJP to decide on a tie-up in Delhi elections.

“It is for the bigger ally in a coalition to take a call about any tie-up ahead of the polls. We have seen what happened in the recently held Jharkhand assembly elections,” he told reporters, referring to the BJP's loss in it.

JD (U), another BJP’s ally, has also decided to field its candidate in Delhi elections, like it did in Jharkhand. However, both JD(U) as well as LJP could not win even a single seat in Jharkhand elections.

Meanwhile, former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi’s HAM(S) has also decided to contest 15 seats in Delhi, including Purani Dilli (Old Delhi) and Patparganj, against Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and deputy CM Manish Sisodia , respectively.

HAM(S) spokesperson Danish Rizwan told TOI that Aditi Singh from Purani Dilli and Shatrughan Kumar alias Munna Singh from Patparganj will be the party candidates. “They will file their nomination papers on January 16. We also held a meeting in Patparganj on Tuesday in the presence of Manjhi ji,” he said and added: “Our candidates on 15 seats have already started campaign. We are fighting this election on local issues.”

54,['15/01/2020'],Yogi: CAA will provide justice to persecuted Hindus of Pak,"This story is from January 15, 2020

GAYA: UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday held an awareness rally in Gaya on the recently enacted Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Addressing the public meeting at Gandhi Maidan, he said Indian Muslims enjoy equal citizenship rights, but minorities in Pakistan were ill-treated.

“While the population of Indian Muslims increased by more than five times since Independence, the Hindu population of (undivided) Pakistan came down from 20% to less than 4% in the same period,” Yogi said.

Attributed the decline of minority population in Pakistan to “mass killings, forced exodus and coercive conversion”, he added: “The CAA will provide justice to such Hindus who were compelled to leave their homeland on account of religious persecution and oppression.”

The UP CM, who arrived at the venue to slogans of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Hindu Hriday Samrat’, in his 28-minute speech, praised the “tolerance” of Indians. “Even Sonia Gandhi, a Christian by faith, was welcomed in India, something that was possible only in our country.”

Echoing the assertions of PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah on CAA, Yogi reiterated the “innocuous” nature of the Act and said it was about giving and not snatching citizenship rights.

“Those who are calling the CAA unconstitutional are, in fact, heaping insult on Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian Constitution,” said Yogi. He also questioned Congress’s moral right to talk about constitutionality as the party, during emergency, ran amok with all constitutional values.

However, while Yogi was nearing the end of his speech, hundreds of black balloons dotted the Gandhi Maidan skyline, purportedly released by anti-CAA protesters in Gaya. Both Yogi and the organisers ignored the black balloons and Yogi soon ended his speech.

Other dignitaries present at the rally included Bihar deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi and state BJP chief Sanjay Jaiswal.

After eating ‘dahi-chura’, Rajendra Nagar Ashok Gupta will organize a kite-flying contest in his locality on Wednesday. “Kids as well as adults can participate in the competition,” he said.

Deliberating on the importance of Makar Sankranti, city-based priest Gyan Pandey said, “Also known as the ‘dahi-chura’ day in Bihar, the festival has a special significance. On this day, the Sun lord, who is revered in the Hindu culture, enters the northern hemisphere. People eat ‘til laddoo’, ‘tilkut’, ‘dahi-chura’, jaggery and other delicacies on the occasion.”

He added, “Many people also bathe in the Ganga on Makar Sankranti.”

However, this year it was decided to have the festival in a city college known for promoting art forms.

57,['15/01/2020'],KKR to infuse $150 million in financial services arm,"This story is from January 15, 2020

(File photo)

BENGALURU: Global alternatives assets major KKR is infusing $150 million in its corporate lending unit KKR India Financial Services (KIFS) at a time when non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are reeling from a liquidity crisis. The additional infusion will help the KKR unit beef up its balance sheet. It plans to continue lending as it expects an attractive market for deal-making in 2020 given the liquidity crunch, said two sources briefed on the matter.

This comes even as KKR deals with several portfolio companies — like Coffee Day, Kwality Dairy and CG Power — facing governance and repayment issues, leading to questions if the company will get caught up in a liquidity crisis. KKR India head and veteran banker Sanjay Nayar had taken over as CEO of the NBFC unit in October from B V Krishnan, who stepped down citing personal reasons.

But with fresh infusion coming in from KKR’s balance sheet, it is likely to continue its play in the structured credit market. “This commitment demonstrates our ongoing support of the KIFS franchise and its future prospects. Moreover, it solidifies KIFS’ financial position, allows KIFS to be proactive in a dislocated market, and reflects our confidence in KIFS and its mission to finance India’s homegrown champions,” said Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall , co-presidents & co-chief operating officers of KKR, in response to TOI’s queries.

In October, rating agency Crisil downgraded KIFS to AA from AA+, citing “pressure on asset quality”. The unit had a loan book of Rs 5,878 crore as of June 2019 with a gross non-performing asset (GNPA) of 2%, according to Crisil, with gearing of 1.6 times and net worth of Rs 2,510 crore.

Crisil had also noted that KKR India has been able to recover money from stressed accounts, which covers “repayments (including prepayments) aggregating around Rs 2,000 crore, which is substantially higher than the scheduled collections” from January to August 2019.

KKR has been one of the major alternative asset players to launch the lending business in India back in 2009, and has also got Abu Dhabi Investment Advisory and Texas Teachers Retirement as shareholders. KIFS has focused on wholesale lending, primarily financing promoter groups and acquisitions, closing 150 deals and deploying over $5 billion till now. Currently, KKR has 36 active borrowers from this unit.

KKR is also likely to put its plans to raise a new Rs 5,000-crore credit fund on hold till the market improves and there are additional opportunities, said one of the sources briefed on the matter. KKR had before this raised two credit funds for India.

PATNA: A day after the safe recovery of Chausa PACS chairman’s son Manish Ranjan from Motihari, police arrested another youth from Patna for his alleged involvement in his kidnapping case on Tuesday evening. Police had arrested eight youths in the case on Monday night.

The arrested accused was identified as Yamraj alias Ujjwal Kumar. “The youths planned to randomly kidnap anyone for making easy money through ransom and lead a lavish life. Ankit Kumar alias Ankit Sarkar and Sanjeet Kumar Singh were their group leaders,” City SP (central) Vinay Tiwary said.

Ankit and Sanjeet were among the eight kidnappers arrested on Monday. Others arrested in the case were identified as Raju Mishra alias Rajnish Mishra, Shivendra Kumar Chaubey, Rahul Kumar alias Charsi, Kamal Kumar Pandey alias Prince, Arjun Kumar alias Sunny and Srijan Kumar Gupta, all in their early 20s.

The SP said kidnappers had planned to take ransom of around Rs10-15 lakh from Manish’s father after they came to know that he was a PACS chairman’s son. They were, however, arrested before making any ransom call.

Manish was kidnapped while walking with another friend Raghvendra Singh near Sai temple under Patliputra police station on January 9 evening. He had come to Patna to write the JEE Main examination from his native village Chausa in Buxar district. Manish’s father Manoj Kumar Singh is Chausa primary agriculture cooperative society (PACS) chairman.

He was recovered from a lodge under Town police station area in Motihari on Monday. A Patna police team led by Tiwary had gone to Motihari for conducting raids and rescuing the victim.

Tiwary said Ujjwal was one of the five kidnappers inside the car when they kidnapped Manish from roadside. He said altogether ten youths were involved in the case. “Car used for kidnapping Manish was also seized from Motihari,” he said.

“Sanjeet and Ankit had planned the kidnapping and hired a car using an app for three days at Rs2000 rent per day. They took Manish to Motihari via Gopalganj,” he said, adding the duo with one more were arrested from Patna..

The SP said police laid a trap after which four more kidnappers got arrested from Motihari. The lodge where they had kept Manish was also raided, leading to recovery and arrest of another kidnapper.

PATNA: State health minister Mangal Pandey laid the foundation stone for a common biomedical waste treatment facility (CBMWTF) at Ramachak Bairiya on Tuesday. This plant with two incinerators will have the capacity to treat 500kg of waste in an hour and is expected to start functioning in three months. It is being built at the cost of Rs4.93 crore.

The plant is coming up on 1.5 acres of land, which was allocated to Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in 2017. Though it was supposed to be completed in 2018, sources said waiting for getting the state environment body’s nod delayed the project.

Once completed, this will be the second CBMWTF in the capital, as one has been already functional on IGIMS campus since 2006. However, the plant at IGIMS will be closed down as the area has been earmarked for a 500-bed hospital. Also, the plant is completing its lifespan, an official said.

Superintendent engineer-cum-nodal officer of CBMWTF at IGIMS, Shailendra Kumar Singh, said the upcoming facility is being built on a public-private-partnership (PPP) mode. “While IGIMS will also provide its customers, a Prayagraj-based firm is installing the plant and will carry out waste treatment work. IGIMS will be given 20% of the revenue generated. Also, it will not be charged for its own waste,” said Singh.

He further said the new CBMWTF will start functioning in the next three months, while construction of office and green area will take six months to complete. It will treat biomedical waste of from Patna, Buxar, Nalanda, Ara, Kaimur and Rohtas districts.

As of now, 2530 medical institutes, including government and private hospitals, clinics and laboratories are registered with the biomedical waste treatment plant at IGIMS.

Trichy: Following complaints from the farmer community across delta districts about the exorbitant rent charged for harvester machines by private parties, the district administrations intervened into the matter and fixed the rental rates for these machines.

Farmers said that since the number of harvester machines owned by agriculture engineering department in Thanjavur, Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur are very few in few in number, they are forced to rely on private operators who rent their harvesters during the paddy harvest season. K Gunasekaran, a farmer from Papanasam said that private operators are mostly from outside the state, particularly from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. “We are already in a spot due to issues like labour crunch rising wages and input costs. After spending almost all we have got to raise the crop, we find it difficult to spend a large sum for harvest”, he lamented.

The secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, Swamimalai S Vimalnathan, alleged that some of the locals act as middlemen and influence the harvester machine owners to charge more by getting some brokerage. Meanwhile, the Thanjavur district collector, M Govinda Rao convened a meeting where officials from the agriculture department, Regional Transport Office and leaders of farmers’ associations participated. During the meeting, the rent was fixed at a maximum of Rs. 2,000 per hour for belt type harvester and Rs 1,500 per hour for tyre type harvester. There are certain variations in the rents fixed district-wise, depending on the demand. The collector also warned the harvesters not to fleece farmers. The rent for the belt type and tyre type harvesters owned by the agriculture engineering department has been fixed as Rs 1,415 and Rs 875 respectively across delta districts.

Chennai: Now, being a data savvy techie does not mean your options are narrowed to just data science and AI, when it comes to jobs. With the increasing relevance of data and analytics one can chalk a career in digital marketing too. The increasing need for such professionals has led to techies taking up digital marketing courses to utilise the growth in digital marketing vacancies and leverage their skills.

City-based e-learning platform Great Learning for e.g. claims to have about 50% of its students — who take up digital marketing programme — having a tech backgrouund. “The skillsets needed for the digital marketing role are changing to include more data centric approach. This fits naturally with techies and we are doubling this segment with each new group,” said Hari Krishnan Nair, co-founder, Great Learning.

Apart from having an edge over non-techies, the transition is a lot easier, feels the engineering clan. Sriram R, an engineer-turned freelance digital marketer adds that he is able to apply the number crunching that he learnt during his stint at an IT firm to his newly-acquired skills learnt through a 6-month digital marketing course. “The transition is much easier than going through a whole new course involving more languages and coding. We all use social media and consume ads and content there, and therefore I could relate to them better,” he added. Mayank Kumar, founder of Mumbai-based upGrad adds that engineers and tech professionals who formed only about 15% of the total base less than a year ago, have risen to claiming 25% of their student base. “Digital marketing is getting more technical and data driven and the engineer participation is growing at 100% because the field is becoming more analytical and the transition from a tech course/job is easier,” he said. However, it is not just professionals who are looking to transcend to digital marketing careers, even tech students are taking up internships to have an early head start in their careers. Gurgaon-based intership platform Internshala, has seen “a 27% increase in the number of STEM( Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) students opting for non-technical online trainings since 2018. 45% of these are taking up digital marketing, claims the online training platform,” said Sarvesh Agarwal, founder, Internshala. “As the supply of engineering students is higher than demand, it becomes extremely difficult for them to find a suitable job. As a result, students find their comfort in digital marketing training as there are endless opportunities for them in this field. Job-specific skills like analytical rigour, strategy making, problem-solving, and technological competency that engineering graduates acquire during their coursework help them clinch good offers,” said Sarvesh Agarwal, founder, Internshala.

Swati Deshpande | TNN

Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Tuesday passed no orders in a challenge raised by the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) to a January 1 government circular that caps pricing by TV channels. The HC , however, placed it for hearing and interim orders on January 22.

The bench of Justices S C Dharmadhikari and R I Chagla granted no immediate relief to the broadcasters and gave time to regulator Trai to file its reply. The counsels for various broadcasters and associations that approached the HC sought to impress on the bench the urgency and need for orders to prevent coercive steps, since the deadline for them to offer their new rates is January 15. The new regulation requires channels in a bouquet to be priced no more than Rs 12, which is lower than the current bar of Rs 19. The reduction is arbitrary and unconstitutional, broadcasters said.

“A prescription of ceiling of MRP of Rs 12 on a-la-carte channels forming part of a bouquet, or for that matter, fixation of any ceiling on a-la-carte and/or bouquet is an invasion in broadcaster’s right to enter into commercial contracts for exploitation of free speech,” the broadcasters’ foundation contended. Others who were present in court included Films and Television Producers Guild, Sony Pictures, Star India, Zee, Disney India, Asianet and TV18.It espouses interest of consumers, is what Trai contended as its counsel Venkatesh Dhond sought time to file a reply to justify what was done “was with good reason”. It will benefit consumers who were hit by “bouquets” offered by broadcasters, which prevented people from choosing an a-la-carte menu of channels of their preference, is what Trai suggested.

The IBF, represented by advocate Abhishek Malhotra and counsel Gopal Jain, essentially pleaded that the Trai’s latest regulation to curb pricing totally encroaches on freedom of broadcasters. The Trai feels consumers’ a-la-carte choice is being interfered with. “There are 909 channels and 336 broadcasters,” said Dhond. “Paid channels are 330 and rest are free to air. The scheme is in interest of all broadcasters,” he added, complaining that the broadcasters “can’t come at the last minute and say no coercive steps”. A battery of counsels like Janak Dwarkadas, Darius Khambata, Aspi Chinoy, Navroz Seervai, Ravi Kadam and Soli Cooper stood up to point out that “it can’t at the same time be said that the consequences of not filing rate card by January 15 won’t ensue”.Dwarkadas said the latest move flouts rules that “clearly allow for 60 days for publishing a rate card” and sought that the January 15 deadline be deferred till court hears the matter. He said the rules permit a bouquet being given as a choice to consumers as they contain a variety of paying channels.

On publishing the rates, a distributor can accept it and broadcasters will have to then mandatorily enter into a contract for a year on such rate, said a counsel. There are 800 distributors whose contract are expiring. “Now they want chaos.”

Chinoy said, “We will be exposed to all sorts of consequences” if no relief is granted and the matter is defeated by a week by court. He pleaded that the court look at “balance of convenience”. “It should not be such that it irreversibly alters the status quo.”

“All that we are saying is protect us against any coercive action that may ensue,” said the broadcasters’ counsels.

“...the analogy given by respondent (Trai) in coming to the conclusion that the subscribers are not choosing a-la-carte channels on account of bouquets being available at discount is not only incorrect, but is not based on any facts, and has not been assessed based on the market realities about consumer behaviour qua economic considerations,” the IBF petition said.

The judges said there are “seized of the matter” and that there were other petitions filed by individuals too. The counsels for broadcasters said the court could record that it was seized of the matter while adjourning it. Justice Dharmadhikari smiled.

65,['15/01/2020'],"Y Combinator doubles India bets, selects 26 startups","This story is from January 15, 2020

(Representative image)

BENGALURU: Top Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator told TOI it has picked 26 Indian startups in its winter 2020 or W20 batch, almost doubling the number of startups in this batch from India. In the previous batch, the influential accelerator had picked about 14 Indian startups, which was also a record number.

TOI first reported the development in December 2019 on Y Combinator — popularly known as YC — doubling down on its bets in India. This comes at a time when YC last year announced its exit from China and top venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital is being bullish on early-stage local startups with its accelerator programme — Surge — in India.

The Mountain View-based YC typically picked 5-10 startups each batch from India over the last 2-3 years. It has a portfolio of 2,000 companies and over 20 unicorns, which includes some of the most valued startups in the world including Airbnb , Stripe, Dropbox and DoorDash.

The spokesperson of YC declined to disclose the names of the Indian startups selected in this batch.

Typically, a YC batch sees about 180-200 startups and about 40% of them would be from outside the US. According to the latest numbers from India, it would mean domestic startups would have a larger share among international startups for YC at about 15% in the winter batch compared to 7% in the previous batch.

YC’s increased focus on India is also reflected in its top executives coming to India last year to conduct interviews. Earlier, startups had to go to the US. In September last year, YC’s new president Geoff Ralston had told TOI he wants to fund more Indian unicorns and that India will dominate as a market, outside the US.

Some of the prominent bets of YC in India include payments startup Razorpay, fin-tech firm ClearTax and social commerce player Meesho, which were part of its earlier 2015 and 2016 batches.

66,['15/01/2020'],Maharashtra: Education divisional office to move to new building,"This story is from January 15, 2020

NASHIK: The divisional office of the state school education department will no more face inconveniences like setting up pandals for distributing exam papers or holding meetings of principals as it will soon start functioning from a spacious building.

“The department will move from its rented place at Mumbai Naka to its own three-storey building at Adgaon near New English School from the first week of February,” Nitin Upasani, secretary of the Nashik divisional office of the department, said on Tuesday.

The department spent nearly two decades at its old office in a 22,000 sqft rented space of a private hospital. In 2018, the government had sanctioned five acres of land for the building, which has been constructed at a cost of Rs 22 crore.

“The process of submission of SSC and HSC answer scripts and moderation of answer books and examination meetings will be conducted at the new building ,” said Upasani.

The old office created a major hindrance to the staff due to a lack of space, he said. “Apart from paying heavy rent, we had to arrange for pandals and coolers for moderators while distributing the exam papers to them.”

By putting the construction process on priority, the board came up with the new building within a year which will be closer to the schools of Dhulia, Jalgaon and Nandubar districts, which come under the Nashik division .

“The new building has an elevator, a waiting lounge for the visitors, conference halls for meetings with the principals, projectors to conduct training and presentations, closed-circuit cameras, a warehouse, a beautiful landscape with 1,700 plants and several other amenities. The board is also in the process of getting a bus stop sanctioned for the area,” said Upasani.

The new building will help schools from other districts and will ease the functioning of the departments, he added.

MUMBAI: UV Asset Reconstruction Company (UVARCL) has emerged as the highest bidder for Reliance Communications ( RCom ) and Reliance Telecom (RTL) — including real estate assets, enterprise and data centre business — with a bid of a little over Rs 16,000 crore. Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio is understood to have emerged as the highest bidder for Anil Ambani ’s telecom infra firm Reliance Infratel with an offer of Rs 3,609 crore.RCom, once a flagship company of the Anil Ambani-led group, received bids from Bharti Airtel and alternate investment firm Varde Partners in addition to UVARCL. Banking sources said that UVARCL’s bid was the highest. Bharti Airtel and UVARCL had also bid for Reliance Infratel.Although RCom is non-operational and has lost its mobile customers for good, the winning bidders will have access to the company’s assets, which include airwaves in the 850MHz band in 14 of India’s 22 telecom circles. Infratel has about 43,000 telecom towers, some fibre and data centres.According to banking industry sources, this is not a done deal as yet. Lenders expect the department of telecom (DoT) to throw a spanner in the works by pressing for repayment of its dues. This is going by their experience with bankrupt telecom operator Aircel where DoT is challenging a deal cleared by the lenders. Bankers also said that the RCom resolution is a complex affair as there are a lot of conditionalities involved with every asset of the company. The meeting of the committee of creditors, which started last weekend, has continued until late on Monday.Lenders had sought the help of Dun & Bradstreet for a feasibility report, while SBI Caps appraised the financial bids. A large chunk of UVARCL’s repayment to creditors is understood to be spread over seven years, linked to recoveries from sale of RCom’s assets.Resolution profession Anish Nanavati had verified claims of Rs 31,788 crore of financial creditors and an additional Rs 22,455 crore from DoT. In the case of RTL, loans of Rs 35,192 crore and DoT’s Rs 2,073 crore have been verified. Reliance Infratel has received claims of Rs 36,195 crore. The bid amounts are lower than the 20-25% recoveries that lenders were anticipating through the bankruptcy process.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73264222,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60580,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jio-asset-rejig-co-top-bidders-for-debt-hit-rcom-group-cos/articleshow/73258548.cms

Representative image

PATNA: Police on late Monday night arrested one Mishal Ranjan (22) for his alleged involvement in the kidnapping of a youth at gunpoint from Patliputra roundabout. The youth was kidnapped in a SUV and taken to the basement of Maharaja Kameshwar Complex near Dak Bungalow roundabout and thrashed mercilessly.

The victim was identified as Ankit Singh (22). He is a resident of Siddeshwar Nagar under Patliputra police station area.

The incident took place around 8pm and police rescued him within an hour from the Maharaja complex. SSP Upendra Sharma and City SP (central) Vinay Tiwary rushed to the spot after the matter was brought to their knowledge.

An FIR was lodged with Patliputra police station on Ankit’s statement. At least three more named accused are absconding.

Tiwary said Mishal was detained from the spot immediately after rescuing Ankit. “More than a dozen of sticks, rods and other blunt weapons were seized from there,” he said.

In reply to a query, the SP said no firearms were recovered. “He was rushed to a hospital for treatment due to injuries received from thrashing. The matter was related to rivalry between two groups,” he said.

Meanwhile, Anshuman Singh, who accompanied Ankit when he was kidnapped, said Mishal was continuously threatening and abusing them on phone for helping a youth named Lucky whose high-end bike was forcefully snatched by the accused from a gym at Nageshwar Colony around a fortnight back. Anshuman is a resident of New Patliputra Colony.

“That bike was later recovered with the help of police but no action was taken against Mishal that time as his family is well connected to influential people. He continued to threaten us since then, leading to the Monday night incident,” he said.

Anshuman said at least 35-40 people, including Mishal and his relatives, had reached the spot in four separate SUVs.

“They first tried to drag me inside but Ankit pushed them apart. After that Mishal and other pointed gun at Ankit, hit him hard with pistol’s butt and dragged him inside one of the SUVs,” Anshuman said, adding Ankit’s cellphone was snatched and he received multiple stitches on his head.

Anshuman said he along with his one more friend rushed to Patliputra police station and informed the policemen about the incident. “We came to know from police that Ankit was taken to a marketing complex. We immediately reached there followed by the police,” he added.

BENGALURU: Verlinvest , the Belgium-based investment holding company created by the founding families of beer major Anheuser-Busch InBev, is coming in as the anchor investor in Spring Marketing Capital , a $30-million venture capital fund. The firm expects to make a first close of $15-20 million by March this year and start making new investments.

The new venture fund has also got managing partners from top VC firms like Matrix Partners’ Avnish Bajaj, A91 Partners’ Abhay Pandey and Saama Capital’s Ash Lilani. There are also entrepreneurs like Cred’s Kunal Shah and Citrus Pay’s Amrish Rau & Jitendra Gupta as backers.

Spring Marketing Capital is taking up a unique concept where it will closely work with VC firms to co-invest in their consumer-facing portfolio companies to help founders shape branding and marketing strategy in the early days. Its founders include Sequoia Capital India’s former chief marketing officer Raja Ganapathy, besides top professionals from advertisement world, including former DDB Mudra CEO Vineet Gupta and Lowe Lintas chairman Arun Iyer.

“Internet is clearly shortening the time-to-market for consumer products and winners will be players who build a brand and not just distribution. The marketing industry is fragmented and is not tailored towards startups but large corporations,” said Ganapathy, who has also worked at Ogilvy and Deutsche Bank, talking about the gap it is filling in the market.

The commitment by Verlinvest, which manages assets of $1.8 billion globally, will give it heft as it has backed companies like Kishore Biyani’s Future Consumer Enterprises, yogurt maker Epigamia and wine maker Sula.

Spring Marketing expects to make about five co-investments of $1-2 million each year, while it will also work on around 15 projects or assignments, especially with larger players. Over the last 12 months, it has already worked with 20 brands including education technology unicorn Byju’s and mattress company Wakefit besides large companies like Cipla for its Nicotex product.

Trichy: Oriens goloides (Moore) or Indian Dartlet, the butterfly species mostly seen in areas receiving heavy rain, has been spotted on National College Trichy (NCT) campus. Researchers say the butterfly which belongs to the family hesperiidae (skippers) has been spotted for the first time in the region.

“It took us three months to confirm the species to be Indian Dartlet,” says V Muthu Krishnan who spotted it on the campus. An NCT alumnus and junior research fellow at Tropical Butterfly Conservatory Trichy (TBCT), Muthu Krishnan said Indian Dartlet was not spotted so far among the 109 species of butterflies found in TBCT. It appeared similar to Plain Palm Dart, Dark Palm Aart and Pale Palm Dart. It is found more in Western Ghats, particularly Coimbatore, Nilgiris and Kanyakumari, he said.

“This is the forty-third butterfly species spotted on the college premises over the last one year,” said V Gokula, associate professor and head of zoology department in NCT. He said that the zoology department has been preparing a checklist of butterfly species on the campus over the last one year. The work was carried out as part of the Star scheme of the department of biotechnology, government of India to promote biotechnology. In all, five departments including zoology has been selected under the scheme.

Muthu Krishnan said that considerable rain this year could be a possible reason for the butterfly to be spotted in the region. Apart from places with heavy rainfall, it is commonly found in hills with an altitude of 1600 feet.

Thiruvananthapuram: Perceived threat from Maoists, in the wake of the encounter with the police in Palakkad last October, has prompted the force to step up the security at Ponnambalamedu (where Makara Jyothi is lighted) and its surrounding viewpoints. Policemen have already taken over all strategic points as part of intensive surveillance of the region for Makaravilakku festival on Wednesday.

Ponnambalamedu hill, which falls in Goodrical range of Ranni forest division, is located opposite to the eastern side of Sabarimala Hill at an altitude of 1,170m. The security document prepared by the police, accessed by TOI, showed 16 major points in and around Ponnambalamedu that are inside dense forests.

Police have also divided the locations from where Makara Jyothi can be viewed in Pathanamthitta to six security divisions for augmenting security. Police have increased the security measures at Panjippara, Nellimala, Ayyanmala, Elavumkal, Attathode, Hill Top etc. All these points, except Attathode and Hill top, are forest areas which are vulnerable to landslides and human stampede.

After the recent police action against left-wing extremists (LWE), we believe that Maoists might make use of every possible opportunity to exact vengeance. The proximity to forest area makes the festival more susceptible, since LWE could hide in the woods and attack police, said the document.

Police personnel on duty at Ponnambalamedu have been given arms and they have been equipped with automatic weapons as well. Recently a ‘threat’ was conveyed in writing at Vadakara station over the killing of Maoists in alleged encounters since 2016.

Taking a cue from the defamatory posters and social media posts regarding the conduct of Makaravilakku festival, police are engaged in removing defamatory social media posts and posters that might hurt the sentiment of believers. Cyber cell and social media unit have been directed to monitor trolls and discussions on the topic.

The police document said that the threat from anti-national elements, hardened criminals, extremists and religious fundamentalists groups operating in India, local disgruntled elements, misguided individuals and communal elements cannot be ruled out.

For ensuring free and uninterrupted flow of vehicles, ‘one-way’ traffic will be introduced from 2pm on Wednesday till Friday, till the outflow becomes normal. Outgoing vehicles from Nilackal will be allowed to go through Elavunkal, Kanamala, Plappally, Laha, Perunadu and Vadasserikkara.

Vehicles coming from Erumely will not be allowed to take deviation to Nilackal at Chethonkara in Ranni. These vehicles will be directed to Mandirampady-Vadasserikkara road to Nilackal. Also, no vehicle can be parked at Laha, Perunadu and Vadasserikkara towns after 2pm on Wednesday till traffic restrictions are withdrawn. The traffic scheme has been divided into 13 sectors, for which additional SP (Pathanamthitta) will be responsible.

As many as 2,400 police officials are on duty at Sannidhanam, Pamba and Nilackal during Makaravilakku festival. This excludes senior officials, bomb squad, and other special teams who have been deployed for emergency requirements.

78,['15/01/2020'],"Green belt to protect coast from sea erosion, cyclones","This story is from January 15, 2020

Naturally grown vegetation that protects the shore from sea erosion and wind at Kirimanjeshwara in Udupi.

Mangaluru: The department of environment is all set for the creation of green belts of coastal vegetation on the Karnataka coast to prevent sea erosion on the shore and to protect agriculture and properties on the landward side.

‘Adoption of Wind Resistant Aerodynamic Green Coastal Infrastructure’, a bio-shielding as a biological barrier to control coastal erosion and protection, will be taken up at 10 identified coastal villages in Uttar Kannada, Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts. The World Bank funded Integrated Coastal Zonal Management Project (ICZMP) will be commenced from April and will be completed in four years.

A total Rs 310 crore has been reserved to take up various measures to address issues of coastal Karnataka, said Dr Dinesh Kumar, regional director (environment).

“It is observed that in the entire shoreline management plan, least importance has been given to biological means of coastal protection measures or living shoreline. Various studies conducted by central government agencies like National Institute of Ocean Technology, National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management and the volume II of ‘Coastal Ecosystems of the Karnataka State’ by Dr T Ananda Rao and Dr A N Sharief also recommends green belt/ living shoreline as a biological barrier to control erosion of beaches,” he said.

“In the past one year, we have experienced seven cyclones of different magnitudes. In addition to coastal erosion, noticeable damage also has been caused during cyclones. Salt spray during cyclones damages agricultural land by burning crops. Ingression of saline water leads to loss of fertility of soil. Sand drifting due to wind not only harms agriculture, but also damages houses and properties. High winds during monsoons and cyclones damages life and property of fishermen and coastal dwellers. The project aims at protecting the coast, fishermen and agriculture,” Kumar said.

“On a pilot basis, the project will be implemented at Tannirbavi, Idya, Kodikanyana, Shiroor, Gangolli, Kaggala, Dhareshwara, Machali, Harvada and Belikeri. The project involves creation of fidelity creepers and grass zone (growing species like ipomoea, spinifex, Cyprus, cynodon, hydrophylax, sesuvium, launaea and canavalia), closed herbaceous zone (clerodendrum, vitex, pandanus, premna, crotalaria, scaevola and dattura), middle mixed bushy zone (pandanus, premna, vitex, scaevola, opuntia, calotropis, cerbera, morinda citricifolia, nili gida, calophyllum) and landward woodland zone (bushy, woody and tall growing trees), at the identified places. This will not only prevent coastal erosion, but also take the coastal wind direction upwards to safer heights, to save lives and properties on the landward side,” he added.

Jaipur: Jaipur Development Authority’s ( JDA ) Shiv Vihar housing scheme where 346 plots are proposed to be developed is receiving overwhelming response from residents.

Learning lessons from the past when the projects were developed in far-flung locations, the JDA this time has proposed to develop the scheme inside the city near Muhana Mandi. The civic body is receiving applications in large numbers as the last date is approaching. A senior official said, “The civic body has received 6,288 applications so far. The lottery for the scheme will be held on February 5.”

The civic body has fixed a reserve price of Rs 25,000 per square-metre in this scheme. The plots, sized between 45 square-metre to 220 square-metre will be developed in the colony.

Officials were expecting good response as it is situated on the 200-Feet Road connecting Muhana and Gopalpura Road.

A senior official said, “The move is expected to boost revenue that will be utilised to develop infrastructure. As the market condition has improved, the JDA filled its coffers after auctioning plots in its old scheme,” he said.

As JDA has many schemes in far-flung areas, not many residents have applied to buy those in the past as the authorities failed to provide even basic facilities.

Due to lack of power and water, the sites of these colonies continue to wear a deserted look. An official source said since 2005, the civic body has launched 31 housing schemes, but most of those are still unoccupied.

When the previous BJP government came to power in the state, the JDA launched many housing schemes after a gap of four years. The cash-strapped body earned a revenue of Rs 700 crore from those schemes. However, this money has not been spent on developing these colonies.

IMD’s decision comes at a time when independent weather bloggers are gaining popularity for accurate forecasts... Read More

CHENNAI: The decision of India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) to block access to certain weather-related datasets on its new website, by either removing them or by making them paid, has sparked outrage.

While bloggers believe the move was to stop them from using IMD data to draw their own forecasts, researchers believe denying free access to certain weather parameters will discourage young researchers from planning new study topics.

Last week, soon after http://www.mausam.imd.gov.in was launched and links to a few datasets, including high resolution full disk, sector and divisional sector satellite images, images of INSAT 3A and Oceansat-1, were removed, a few researchers and weather enthusiasts expressed disappointment online.

In a release, the agency said, “India Meteorological Department has launched a new website specially for general public. It contains information for the general public. If any organization is interested to access further information from IMD for commercial and R&D purpose, they may contact IMD...”

Researchers are unhappy. “Open data has sparked a lot of research before. At present, we know what kind of data is available with IMD that we can request for. But a few years later, researchers would no longer even know the kind of data that exists with IMD. Writing to their officials to get access to data is only going to create more red tape. It will eventually lead to data closure and the presence of the data itself would be forgotten,” said Raj Bhagat Palanichamy, GIS and remote sensing analyst, World Resources Institute.

IMD’s decision comes at a time when independent weather bloggers are gaining popularity for accurate forecasts intelligibly presented to the public, while the national forecaster is drawing flak for getting it wrong.

Weather blogger Pradeep John, with more than seven lakh followers on his account, said he wouldn’t buy the idea that people will misuse IMD data and make money out of it. “I don’t think the potential of making money in weather forecasting in India is huge. If somebody uses it without acknowledging it to IMD, then they can look for other ways to stop it than denying free access to data to all,” he said.

After the online outrage, IMD restored some data on its new website. “What they have done is not correct. They are the nodal agency and are supposed to provide open access to their data to everybody,” said Prof Sridhar Balasubramanian, climate expert, IIT Bombay.

A few researchers have welcomed IMD’s decision as an effort to protect its scientists’ workforce.

“Bloggers use IMD data and handout forecast which is in contrast to that of IMD and people get confused. I think IMD is doing it to protect its scientists who have been constantly facing public criticism even if their forecast is right and weather bloggers have a major role to play in this,” said a researcher on anonymity.

M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences that includes IMD, said the website was not meant for researchers or bloggers. “Our old website had a mix of products meant both for the public and experienced weather forecasters. Now, we have filtered and retained only those that could be understood by the public. Those who want our data for other purposes can contact us,” he said. “We are a government organisation and we cannot deny information. But we are also worried that many use our data and do not acknowledge IMD.”

File pic of desert festival

JAIPUR: Rajasthan may have built its tourism around its storied monuments but the state now wants to make it more experiential, woven around its cultural riches and intangible heritage to increase the number of repeat tourists which is in single-digits now.

Be it kite festival that starts early in the beginning of the year, desert festival in Jaisalmer or the world music extravaganza in Udaipur that hosts global artists and ensembles from over 20 countries, the cultural calendar is chock-a-block.

As the experiential travel is growing apace, the government has also been investing in fairs and festivals that not only complement the state’s iconic monuments but help promote activity-based tourism “We support over 60 fairs and festivals and the cultural calendar is jam-packed. While we can still add new festivals that have tourist potential, our focus is now to expand the scope and impact of existing ones,” said Bhanwar Lal, director, department of tourism.

Currently, the department spends around Rs 9 crore annually to preserve and promote the intangible heritage of the state that includes its various art forms, music, handicraft and rural traditions.

Many countries and travel companies in the world are diversifying their tourism products through experiential activities, covering adventure, culture, culinary journeys, wine, sports etc. They are catering to new breed of travelers who are no more interested in a post-card picture of sitting on the beach and relaxing.

“Culturally, Rajasthan is a treasure-trove. The people in the rural areas with colourful turbans and long mustaches themselves are an attraction to any outsider. But they possess amazing skills in folk music, dances, puppetry, acrobatic dances, etc. These are our natural strengths and they have a great universal tourism appeal. Besides, fairs are also about living our traditions in way and thus we need to preserve them,” said Bhanwar Lal.

During the past few years, some popular monuments in Jaipur were opened to the public during night time realizing the emerging trend of activity-based tourism.

“We have wonderful monuments that can be compared to any structure in the world. But sadly, our percentage of repeat foreign tourists is not even 5%. Unless we focus hard on experiential tourism, the repeat tourist numbers will not increase,” said a leading tour operator.

Recently, UNESCO India and the Rajasthan tourism department signed a partnership agreement to promote community-based responsible tourism based on the rich intangible cultural heritage of the western Rajasthan. This is expected to add further impetus to the efforts of the state for promoting experiential tourism in the state.

Bareilly: Days after a 17-year-old girl was dragged into a sugarcane field and allegedly raped by a youth, who shoved his mobile phone into her mouth to ensure that she doesn’t shout during the assault, police nabbed the accused from his house. The girl worked as a labourer in cane fields near the plywood factory where the accused, Sunil Kumar, was employed in Fatehganj East area of Bareilly. The mobile phone, which Sunil used to muzzle the voice of the minor girl, later helped the police reach him. According to police, the assault took place on January 7. Sunil, after the alleged assault, fled after seeing people approaching towards the field, leaving the phone behind. The rape survivor and her family members didn’t approach police for a few days.

“They didn’t know who the accused was. But, when they received a phone call on the accused’s mobile, they decided to contact the police,” a police officer said. Police reached Sunil with the help of SIM card found in the phone, which was registered in his name. An FIR was registered and Sunil was arrested on Monday. The girl was sent for medical examination.

After his arrest, the accused told police that he knew the girl for the last one month and had gifted the mobile phone on her request. “But the girl has denied knowing the accused,” said Ashwini Kumar, SHO of Fatehganj East police station.

SHO Kumar told TOI, “We have arrested the main accused and during questioning he said that he knew the girl for the last one month and had gifted the mobile phone on her request. We cross checked with the girl but she denied it.”

Trichy: The corporation on Tuesday opened five waste collection centres in the city and netted 1.5 tonnes of refuse that would have been otherwise set on fire by the city dwellers. The civic body will transport the collected waste to cement factories to use it as a fuel in furnaces.

The move is expected to prevent people from burning the discards at public places, thus polluting the air during Bhogi festival. Bhogi festival, as a part of Pongal festivities, is traditionally known for burning waste materials.

The smoke emanating from the waste often degrades the quality of the atmosphere, even causing health issues to people with respiratory illness. Ariyamangalam and K Abishekapuram zones of Trichy corporation opened five waste collection centres on Allithurai road, Edatheru, EB road, Madurai road and Raja street (G corner) where sanitary workers received the waste handed over by the residents.

Around 1.5 tonnes of waste, mostly non-recyclable and no resalable waste was collected in the centres that operated between 10 am and 6 pm on Tuesday, officials said. Sanitary workers manning the collection centres received the waste from houses that geared up for Pongal by cleaning their households. The waste was segregated in bins based on their quality. “Mostly tyres, boxes, rags, mats and rexin materials were handed over by the residents. We will ship the collected waste to cement factories in Ariyalur where the waste will be used as refuse-derived fuel (RDF) in furnaces,” a sanitary official with Trichy Corporation said. TNN

Meerut: International wrestler Indu Tomar on Tuesday approached Meerut district authorities alleging encroachment of a passage near her house in city’s Mundali area by a local.

“Despite repeated complaints, no action has been taken in the matter and it is affecting the passage near my house. If no action is taken, I will return my medals as mark of protest,” said 22-year-old Tomar.

She has bagged a silver medal in Under-23 National Wrestling Championship in 2018 and represented India in Asian Championship in 2015 and also in World Championship in 2014.

According to the complaint filed by Tomar, her family owns a house in Mau Khas village.

“The passage was spread in 210 square metres. But, a local has encroached on 90 square metres of land,” she alleged.

“My family is being harassed by the local, who is trying to build a boundary wall for his farm on the government land. An application in this regard was earlier submitted to the district authorities, but to no avail. The Mundali police station officers have also started troubling us,” Tomar alleged in the letter.

“If any action is not taken in the matter, I will be left with no option but to return all my medals,” said Tomar.

Sunita Singh, additional city magistrate, who took Tomar’s complaint application, said, “The wrestler in question has asked for the demarcation of boundaries in the area on allegations of encroachment. A team headed by lekhpal has been asked to look into the matter and demarcate the boundaries.”

Hyderabad: Though the ruling TRS may have won quite a number of municipal wards even before the votes are cast as Congress and BJP went without candidates in a large number of wards, it is going to be a triangular contest in the elections to 129 urban local bodies to be held on January 22.

The process of withdrawal of nominations came to an end on Tuesday amidst huge drama. Several candidates refused to withdraw from the electoral fray and threatened to commit suicide. A couple of them actually attempted to commit suicide before the locals and police saved them.

TRS member Abdul Raheem attempted to hang himself before being saved by the locals. He had filed his nomination from municipal ward 39 in Suryapet after taking out a huge rally. However, he was not given the ticket and another candidate got it. Another candidate, Vijay of TRS also attempted to commit suicide in Medchal on not being given a party ticket. The leaders of respective parties were still trying to cajole the party members until reports late on Tuesday night.

While the State Election Commission is yet to release the official data on number of candidates and political parties that remained in fray, TRS secretary Gattu Ramachandra claimed that the TRS candidates have won unanimously in 84 wards in 35 municipal bodies as no other candidates remained in the fray after withdrawal of nominations.

Ramachandra also claimed that there were no BJP candidates left in the poll fray in about 700 wards and that there were no Congress candidates contesting about 400 wards. However, this has not been confirmed by the State Election Commission.

While political analysts said that the ruling TRS has a clear edge over the Congress and BJP in the municipal elections, they said the polls to the ULBs should be viewed as a triangular contest as candidates from Congress and BJP are in fray from a majority of the wards and a keen contest between the parties is on the cards in several urban local bodies. The TRS has more than one candidate in several wards even after the exercise to withdraw nominations concluded on Tuesday.

“TRS has resorted to threats, misuse of police, money and muscle power to ensure that the candidates from other parties withdrew from the electoral fray in many wards. This does not mean that TRS is a clear winner. There is going to be a contest and the Congress will win a large number of municipal wards defeating TRS and BJP,” said Telangana Congress treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy.

The ensuing ULB elections will also witness a multi-cornered contest in urban local bodies of Nizamabad, Kothagudem, Mahbubnagar, Sangareddy and Nalgonda as the MIM, CPI, CPM, TJS, BSP and TDP too are in the electoral fray in the wards of ULBs falling in these districts.

Bareilly: A 21-year-old youth, Guddu, of Moradabad district, was found hanging from a ceiling hook in his house on Monday evening. A few days ago, he was detained by police for questioning in connection with the abduction of a teenage girl by his friend. He had “admitted” to helping his friend to abduct the girl, said police. Now, Guddu’s father, Satpal, has blamed both police and the girl’s family for his death.

Terming the allegations as baseless, Neeraj Sharma, SHO said, “We called him (Guddu) only once and after questioning him, we let him go. Since, he was not involved in abducting the girl, we didn’t arrest him. Now, after his father lodged a complaint, we have registered an FIR under IPC section 306 (abetment of suicide) against the girl’s father and two brothers.”

According to sources, on December 31, the 17-year-old girl went missing from home. On January 3, her father approached the police and lodged an FIR against Guddu’s friend for abducting his daughter. Though Guddu’s name did not figure in the FIR, the complainant had alleged that Guddu had helped his friend in abducting his daughter.

Police had registered a case under IPC section 363 (kidnapping) and 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage) against Guddu’s friend.

Police had detained Guddu and interrogated him. Police claimed that Guddu had confessed that he helped his friend in executing his plan and escorted the couple to Joya. Thereafter, he left them and said he had no clue about the couple’s whereabouts.

Guddu’s family alleged that since the girl’s family had lodged an FIR, police had been harassing their son by calling him at the police station.

“My son had completely broken down due to police torture. On Monday evening, he took the extreme step as he was fed up of police harassment. The girl’s father and brothers had also been threatening our son that they would frame him in a false case soon,” alleged Guddu’s father.

Pawan Kalyan

KAKINADA: Fuelling speculation of a BJP-Jana Sena alliance in Andhra Pradesh ahead of local body and municipal polls, Jana Sena president and actor Pawan Kalyan on Tuesday announced that a meeting of Jana Sena and BJP leaders would be held in Vijayawada on January 16.

BJP’s national leaders are likely to attend the crucial meeting, four days before AP assembly session on January 20 in which chief minister and YSRCP president Y S Jaganmohan Reddy is likely to announce shifting of state capital from Amaravati.

Incidentally, both BJP and Jana Sena are opposed to the three capital cities plan and have categorically stated that Amaravati should be continued as the capital city. Pawan said state administration should be carried out from one place while development should be spread across regions. He also said PM Narendra Modi ’s aspirations were not reflected in Andhra Pradesh. Pawan, who reached Kakinada on Tuesday after holding talks with senior BJP leaders including BJP working president JP Nadda in Delhi on Monday, told reporters that the proposed BJP-Jana Sena meeting in Vijayawada will discuss important issues confronting the state including the proposal to shift the state capital.

He said he had briefed Nadda on the developments in AP, agitation by farmers in Amaravati and foreign investors withdrawing from the state. He said he had visited Delhi only after the BJP leadership invited him.

Jana Sena sources said Pawan was likely to enter into an electoral alliance with BJP in the ensuing mandal and zilla parishad and municipal polls. Local body elections are due next month while the schedule for civic body polls is yet to be announced.

The party, however, ruled out merger of Jana Sena with the BJP. Incidentally, Pawan’s brother Chiranjeevi, who had floated Praja Rajyam Party and won a few assembly seats, later merged his party with the Congress.

Pawan joining hands with BJP is likely to throw a new political equation in Andhra Pradesh. The actor had launched the party after meeting Narendra Modi before the general elections in 2014. Though he did not contest the election then, he had supported the BJP-TDP alliance, which won the assembly elections. He sailed with the BJP till 2017 when he pulled out of the NDA accusing the BJP of cheating AP on the promise of special category status.

Jana Sena contested polls in April 2019 in alliance with the Communists. Pawan had lost both assembly seats he contested including one in his native place, dominated by members of his social group. Jana Sena, however, managed to win one seat. All through the campaign Pawan did not criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi or the BJP, though he was critical of the YSRCP and the TDP.

Pawan hails from numerically strong Kapu community. If Jana Sena and BJP combine could manage to consolidate the Kapu vote bank, the new alliance may pose a political and electoral challenge to YSRCP and TDP. The Kapu community is spread across the state but it is dominant in East and West Godavari districts. Historically, the political party that had won the maximum number of seats in these districts had always formed the government.

Earlier, Pawan’s visit to Kakinada was marred by high tension in view of prohibitory orders in the town. On Sunday Jana Sena and YSRCP activists fought a pitched battle forcing the police to resort to lathicharge. Several people were injured.

KAKINADA: Fuelling speculation of a BJP-Jana Sena alliance in Andhra Pradesh ahead of local body and municipal polls, Jana Sena president and actor Pawan Kalyan on Tuesday announced that a meeting of Jana Sena and BJP leaders would be held in Vijayawada on January 16.

BJP’s national leaders are likely to attend the crucial meeting, four days before AP assembly session on January 20 in which chief minister and YSRCP president Y S Jaganmohan Reddy is likely to announce shifting of state capital from Amaravati.

Incidentally, both BJP and Jana Sena are opposed to the three capital cities plan and have categorically stated that Amaravati should be continued as the capital city. Pawan said state administration should be carried out from one place while development should be spread across regions. He also said PM Narendra Modi ’s aspirations were not reflected in Andhra Pradesh. Pawan, who reached Kakinada on Tuesday after holding talks with senior BJP leaders including BJP working president JP Nadda in Delhi on Monday, told reporters that the proposed BJP-Jana Sena meeting in Vijayawada will discuss important issues confronting the state including the proposal to shift the state capital.

He said he had briefed Nadda on the developments in AP, agitation by farmers in Amaravati and foreign investors withdrawing from the state. He said he had visited Delhi only after the BJP leadership invited him.

Jana Sena sources said Pawan was likely to enter into an electoral alliance with BJP in the ensuing mandal and zilla parishad and municipal polls. Local body elections are due next month while the schedule for civic body polls is yet to be announced.

The party, however, ruled out merger of Jana Sena with the BJP. Incidentally, Pawan’s brother Chiranjeevi, who had floated Praja Rajyam Party and won a few assembly seats, later merged his party with the Congress.

Pawan joining hands with BJP is likely to throw a new political equation in Andhra Pradesh. The actor had launched the party after meeting Narendra Modi before the general elections in 2014. Though he did not contest the election then, he had supported the BJP-TDP alliance, which won the assembly elections. He sailed with the BJP till 2017 when he pulled out of the NDA accusing the BJP of cheating AP on the promise of special category status.

Jana Sena contested polls in April 2019 in alliance with the Communists. Pawan had lost both assembly seats he contested including one in his native place, dominated by members of his social group. Jana Sena, however, managed to win one seat. All through the campaign Pawan did not criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi or the BJP, though he was critical of the YSRCP and the TDP.

Pawan hails from numerically strong Kapu community. If Jana Sena and BJP combine could manage to consolidate the Kapu vote bank, the new alliance may pose a political and electoral challenge to YSRCP and TDP. The Kapu community is spread across the state but it is dominant in East and West Godavari districts. Historically, the political party that had won the maximum number of seats in these districts had always formed the government.

Earlier, Pawan’s visit to Kakinada was marred by high tension in view of prohibitory orders in the town. On Sunday Jana Sena and YSRCP activists fought a pitched battle forcing the police to resort to lathicharge. Several people were injured.

MANGALURU: A quack was arrested at a private hospital in Derlakatte and sent behind bars. The accused, who is a first-year MBBS dropout, had entered two hospitals, examined patients and even written prescriptions.

The incident took place at Yenepoya Medical College , Derlakatte, on Sunday night. The accused is Mohammed Habib Hussain , 28, a resident of Shivamogga , who currently resides in Attavar, Mangaluru. The motive of the accused for visiting hospitals is not known, but police said that he was a medical college dropout. He discontinued studies after the first year due to personal reasons. Dr Sampathila Padmanabha, medical superintendent, Yenepoya Medical College, said the accused had come to the medical college at midnight on December 29.

After speaking to the security guard at the hospital entrance, he introduced himself as an assistant to the consulting urologist, and wanted to visit patients at the private ward situated at floor number 7. After entering, he called the duty nurse to get case sheets. Later, he examined two women patients in the presence of the duty nurse, and also wrote a prescription on the patient case sheet. He also yelled at a nurse, saying that she isn’t doing her duty properly, and left the place.

Nurse grew suspicious

However, the nurse who grew suspicious, informed the management, after the accused had left the place. The management, who crosschecked about the accused, found out that he is not a doctor, and that he is also not associated with the hospital.

The management sent an advisory to all employees to produce their identity cards, whenever they enter any wards, especially at night, and also to keep an eye on anyone suspicious. The same message was passed on to other hospitals in the vicinity.

The accused again showed up at the hospital on Sunday night. As security guards were told about strangers visiting the hospital in the guise of doctors, he was allowed to enter the hospital premises, so that he can be apprehended. He later went to the reception counter and queried about the consultant urologist. When he noticed that the staff had an idea about what was happening, he tried to flee from the spot. He was later caught by a security guard, and the police were informed. He was arrested by Ullal police station personnel.

Dr Padmanabha added that he used to roam around with his friend in a car. He was also involved in a similar incident at a private hospital in Kankanady, and the same has been informed to the police. He visited hospitals in a car, which has been seized by police.

Bareilly: General officer-in-command of Uttar Bharat area, Lt Gen CP Mohanti, has said he will press for an exemption from toll on national highways for ex-servicemen. He made this announcement at the function organized at the Jat Regiment Centre (JRC) at the fourth Veterans’ Day here on Tuesday. The day is observed in memory of first Field Marshal K M Cariappa’s superannuation date on January 14, 1953.

As many as 300 soldiers, officers and 25 ex-servicemen, ‘veer naris’ and war widows of Second World War and their families participated at the function.

GOC Mohanti said by organizing Veterans’ Day, they get an opportunity to express gratitude towards the selfless service and sacrifices made by veterans and their families.

“There were some queries regarding ex-servicemen’s contributory health scheme (ECHS) and these were addressed. The veterans and their families can avail of benefits of the scheme. Besides, the veterans raised a demand seeking exemption from paying toll while they commute on national highways. We feel it is a genuine demand and will the raise the matter with National Highway Authority of India as well as the government,” Mohanti said.

Sunil Dhingra, a retired colonel, said there are several issues, including health facilities, pension and other benefits, about which a number of ex-servicemen and their families are still unaware of. “Today, bankers to education sector and placement agencies hold camps to educate ex-servicemen and their kin about the various schemes being run for their benefits,” he said.

93,['15/01/2020'],1K govt-managed temples of Indore in state of neglect,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Indore: Like Khajrana Ganesh and Ranjeet Hanuman temples, they are also managed by district administration but the condition of these around 1,000 ‘government’ temples of Indore speaks volumes about administrative apathy.

Collectively, these temples have around 5000 acre of land and a regular income through donations that runs into lakhs. Yet, they are totally depended on state government for maintenance of their buildings which in most cases are of historical importance. Even salary of around 1,600 priests in these temples adds up to mere Rs25 lakh per month.

In absence of any proper development plan and regular monitoring, land belonging to many of these religious structures has witnessed encroachments in form of illegal colonies.

Ram Mandir, Maruti Mandir, Pandharinath Mandir, Mahaveer Mandir, Sri Ranchod Mandir and Sri Khedapati Hanuman Mandir are some of the government temples, on whose land illegal colonies and structures have been constructed, official sources said. In some cases, the matter is even pending before courts.

Administrative officials say that there is clear instruction from Apex Court not to consider any sale/purchase or encroachment on government temples as valid but many cases related to private ownership of land attached with the said religious structures are pending in courts as officials concerned failed to deal with it in proper manner.

Another issue that is yet to be addressed by administration is of not keeping records of donations received at most of these temples, which could have been used for their upkeep and further development.

“In 1984-85, state government had appointed district collector as manager of historical religious structures and he had authority to allot land associated with these temples on annual lease for maintenance of priests while donations were used to fund routine tasks. However, some years ago, the land allotment on annual lease was stopped,” ADM Pavan Jain told TOI.

He said that like Khajrana Ganesh Mandir and Ranjeet Hanuman Mandir, some big temples of the city were directly regulated by district administration and a similar plan would be prepared for remaining temples.

“We have asked all SDMs and Tehsildars to present records of number of government temples and land attached with them, identify encroachments on them and present report of maintenance and development that needs to be carried. The income of these temples would also be recorded to help prepare further plan,” Jain said.

District collector Lokesh Kumar Jatav told TOI that development work was carried out at any temple to facilitate number of devotees visiting there. “Huge footfall is recorded at Khajrana Ganesh, Ranjeet Hanuman and Bijasan Mata temples and the same are being developed accordingly. There are many temples in Indore and instructions have given for conserving their land from encroachment. We used to keep records of donation received at notable temples,” he said.

Sukriti Chakravarti

BHOPAL: Fifty students of Madhya Pradesh are all set to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on January 20 for‘Pariksha pe charcha’; this event is being organised for the students appearing for board examinations. Of these, seven students have been selected from Jabalpur while five were selected from Indore. Two students from the state capital have also made it to the list. The selection was done through an essay-writing competition organised by MyGov website.

Bhopal girl Sukriti Chakravarti of class 12 studying in Carmel Convent has also been shortlisted for the prorgamme after her essay on topic ‘Are our exams sufficient to analyze the true potential of students?’ was chosen by the selection committee. “I wrote against the topic as I feel that students’ potential can’t be measured by theoretical exams in all the subjects. I’m also going to ask a question to the PM about lack of awareness about different career paths among the students. All biology students want to pursue MBBS, all mathematics students want to become engineers while commerce students wish to become Chartered Accountants. They don’t know that they can pursue other career options too,” lamented Sukriti.

A student of class 11, Prabhanshu Malviya, of Kendriya Vidhayala No. 3, Bhopal, who has also been selected for the meeting from Bhopal said, ‘it is like a dream come true’ for him. “I never thought that of all the students, my essay will be selected. I am very excited and already working on a few questions that I wish to ask the PM about exam preparations,” he added.

Assistant coordinator, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, Mukesh Sharma, said, “All the schools of the state were asked to let students participate in the essay-writing competition and send their entries. It is a proud moment for us that 50 students of the state got selected. They will all come to Bhopal on January 18 and will leave for the event together along with the officials of education department.”

TV Siva Prakash with a bird

SECUNDERABAD: An animal lover at heart, TV Siva Prakash , has opened his home and wallet to help injured birds and animals ever since he can remember. Such is his love for animals that he has converted his garage and terrace of his house into a shelter to treat injured animals and birds.

Inspired by his father who worked as a forest department official in the Andamans in the 1980s, Prakash learnt the art of rescuing and treating animals from a veterinary doctor who was stationed in the Andamans back then. “During my teenage, I used to tag along with the doctor to rescue animals and birds. I learnt basics of first aid and then slowly went on to learn giving injections and administering medicines,” said Prakash.

Now, the 48-year-old animal rescuer even performs surgeries without having any formal degree in veterinary medicine. He spends Rs 40,000-Rs 50,000 every month from his own pocket to treat those injured.

Prakash’s family moved to Hyderabad in 1995, following which he started his own garage. In the early 2000s, he attended to an injured calf while travelling to Hyderabad from Srikakulam . “I realised that there is a lot of medical assistance available for dogs and cats. However, for the bigger animals like cows and buffaloes, there is very little help available. That’s when I decided to treat animals and birds,” said Prakash.

Prakash’a auto garage Sai Venkata Motors on Neredmet main road is now a clinic-cum-shelter for many cows, buffaloes, monkeys who are undergoing treatment. If that’s not all, the terrace at his residence in Sainikpuri houses ducks, parrots, pigeons and cranes. “Recently, we had a peacock which suffered severe burn injuries on its feathers at a power grid station in Tirmulgherry. While the forest department had lost hope on its survival, I decided to treat the peacock,” said Prakash, who saved the peacock and handed it over to the forest department after 12 days.

Prakash added that the number of injured birds went up during Srankranti due to the use of Chinese manja. “ There is a lack of awareness about animal rescue and rehabilitation. People can take small steps such as keep a bowl of water for birds during summers, feed cows and buffaloes at your doorstep etc,” said Prakash.

He also conducts an adoption drive for dogs outside his garage every Sunday and holds seminars on first aid for animals and birds in schools.

Indore: Crime branch police on Tuesday arrested a man who had been duping influential people of lakhs of rupees by posing as senior police, administrative or judicial officer.

Crime branch ASP Amrendra Singh said that they had received a complaint from MLA Akash Vijayvargiya stating that he got an extortion call from an SP in Indore. On the complaint of MLA’s employee Ram Singh, Pardeshipura police registered a case of fraud.

After tracing the number, a raid was conducted in Falna of Rajasthan and accused Suresh alias Bheriya Ghanchi, a resident of Rajat Nagar was arrested.

File photo of Sahayamatha, the fishing vessel seized in connection with the Munambam human trafficking case

KOCHI: The Munambam illegal migration case, in which around 243 people, including newborns and pregnant women, illegally left the Indian coast on a fishing boat via Maliyankara boat jetty near Munambam harbour, turned one on January 12. But it still remains a mystery whether they have made it to the unknown destination as planned or perished in the deep blue waters.

The police team probing the case has confirmed that the investigation has hit a dead end with no clues about the whereabouts of the missing people, boat and the kingpins behind the voyage , who too were suspected to have left in the same boat.

However, sources from the department said they are hopeful of getting new links in the case as a team from Ernakulam Rural police is gearing up to go to Australia , one of the suspected destinations of their voyage, at the invite of the Australian government to coordinate the investigation. The department is awaiting central government’s clearance for the trip.

It was in the early hours of 12 January 2018, about 243 people, mostly Sri Lankan Tamils from Delhi’s Madangir colony, had left Munambam coast on a fishing boat ‘Dhaya Matha-2’. The incident came into light by noon on the same day when the residents in the area spotted 12 bags containing clothes, packed dry foods and medicines in an abandoned state in a vacant compound near the jetty.

At first many, including the police, assumed that the bags were abandoned by tourists but the gravity of the issue heightened when more similar bags were found abandoned at various places in Cherai and Kodungalloor later.

Initial investigation had later revealed that it was a well-coordinated operation to smuggle out people to foreign countries, mostly Australia, New Zealand and Christmas Islands, which are safe havens for illegal migrants who leave their country chasing their dreams of better fortunes.

Additional superintendent of police (Ernakulam Rural) M J Sojan, lead investigation officer, said, “Our probe found out that it was a pre-planned illegal immigration where the migrants willingly paid up to Rs 3 lakh per head for the voyage. We don’t know where they were headed to or whether they reached anywhere at all. We arrested 10 people in connection with the case but have not been able to trace one Sreekanthan and Selvan who were the kingpins. All others were just organizers who had their share of money for bringing in migrants. They had no idea about where Sreekanthan was taking the people to,” he said.

The ministry of external affairs has alerted all countries where the immigrants could have possibly gone to. The Interpol also has issued a Blue-Corner notice with names, photographs of the missing people, but all in vain as no leads were found till date.

“We have not closed the investigation, but we have not filed the chargesheet as we could not find any main accused or victims. The Australian Federal Police are in constant communication with the state police. With a team going to Australia, there is a chance to pick up some new leads in the case as Australia was suspected to be one of their destinations,” said district police chief (Ernakulam Rural) K Karthick.

NEW DELHI: India and the US remain in touch to finalise mutually convenient dates for a visit by Donald Trump , according to official sources here. Indian officials, though, refused to hazard a guess as to when the visit would take place, even as reports from Washington said Trump’s trip, which will be his first to India as president, could happen in the last week of February.

Trump’s impeachment trial which is set to begin this week doesn’t come in the way of the dates in February end both sides are said to be discussing. February 24 is said to be one of the dates the two sides are considering for Trump’s arrival in India. tnn

Trump had turned down India’s invite to attend the Republic Day parade as chief guest in 2019 because of, as the White House put it, scheduling constraints. The two sides though had continued to discuss the possibility of a visit by Trump in their diplomatic engagements.

The US President had last year said that PM Narendra Modi wanted him to visit India and that he himself was keen on travelling to India.

In a phone conversation with Trump last week, Modi had stated that India-US relations, built on trust, mutual respect and understanding, had grown from strength to strength. Modi also highlighted the “significant progress’’ made in deepening the strategic partnership between the two countries in the previous year and expressed his desire to continue to work with Trump for enhancing cooperation in all areas of mutual interest.

Trump too had expressed satisfaction at the achievements in the relationship in last few years and reiterated his readiness for further deepening bilateral cooperation. An official said though the conversation didn’t dwell much on the proposed visit. Modi though had reiterated the invite to Trump when he met him on the sidelines of UNGA in September.

Vijayawada: Former Union minister and BJP leader Y S Chowdary or Sujana Chowdary on Tuesday requested chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy to continue Amaravati as capital. Stating that Amaravati is a “sovereign commitment”, he cautioned the chief minister against disrespecting it.

The former Union minister wrote a letter to the chief minister explaining how the previous government had selected Amaravati as capital and how 33,000 acres of land was taken from the farmers for the capital after the bifurcation. He said the commitments made to the farmers were sovereign and it is binding on the successive government to honour them.

Chowdary recalled that the TDP, BJP and YSRC had agreed to Amaravati as capital. The location was also cleared by the central government and it was agreed upon to develop it as a green-field city, he said.

He further recalled that the central government had paid Rs 1,500 crore, while the state government had mobilised Rs 2,000 crore through bonds. The state government also received donations from people to the tune of Rs 42 crore. The previous government had initiated 62 projects in Amaravati, while land allocations were made to 130 central government institutions and private organisations, he listed down.

Chowdary said the legislature, executive and judiciary were all functioning from Amaravati, besides the Raj Bhavan. There was no need for the present government to spend any money on the capital, he said and added that the capital could continue in these institutions like it did in the past seven months.

He further said the government would have 8,442.75 acres of land in hand out of the 33,000 acres that could be sold to get Rs 1.26 lakh crore at Rs 15 crore per acre.

“Farmers, entrepreneurs and contractors are stakeholders in the Amaravati project. Governments are permanent unlike people. If any attempt is made to shift the capital from Amaravati, the stakeholders may be forced to seek compensation, which might be a financial burden on the government,” the former Union minister said.

Bareilly: A Class X girl was blackmailed by her friend into coming to a hotel room, where the youth along with his three friends allegedly overpowered and gang-raped the 17-year-old girl in Moradabad’s Katghar area. Local police on Tuesday arrested one of the accused while the hunt to nab the remaining three was on.

In his complaint lodged with police on Monday, the father of the girl said that the accused had filmed a video of his daughter and was threatening to upload it on social media platforms if she didn’t fulfil his “desires”.

The complainant said that on January 10, when the girl went to attend coaching classes after the school, the accused waylaid and took her to a hotel room. “He threatened that if she didn’t accompany her, he would upload the video,” the complainant said.

Over there, she was gang-raped by the four accused.

When the girl didn’t return after the coaching classes were over, her family members reached there. But they were told that the girl didn’t attend the class that day. Later, during their search, someone told the family members that the girl was seen at a hotel in Peer Ka Bazar area.

When they reached there, the girl narrated the whole incident. On the basis of complaint filed by rape survivor’s father, police have lodged FIR against the four accused. One of the accused was arrested on Tuesday.

The inspector (crime) of Thakurdwara, Tejveer Singh, said that they have started investigation after lodging FIR under sections 376 (rape), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) and POCSO Act.

“Today, we got initial success after nabbing one of the accused. He has been sent to jail by a court. We are conducting raids to nab others,” the inspector said.

Representative image

BELAGAVI: Mahadayi issue is likely to prove costly for the BJP in the long run as people in North Karnataka are none too pleased over the delay in issuing the gazette notification by the Centre on sharing the river water. Seers of important mutts in the region have taken up the matter seriously and any further delay in resolving the river row could negatively affect the party’s vote bank in the region dominated by Lingayats.

A few days ago, about 20 religious heads of various mutts gathered in Belagavi and passed a resolution. As per the resolution they sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking mediation between Karnataka and Goa. The meeting was spearheaded by Siddarama Swami, pontiff of Tontadarya Mutt in Gadag.

Venkatesh Patil Vatgal, former JD(S) leader and a political analyst from North Karnataka region said if the issue remains unresolved for limited political gain of some leaders in the BJP, it will boomerang. “Some leaders in BJP do not want BS Yediyurappa claim credit for launching the project. Hence they are buying time for change of guard. People are now realising this conspiracy and if anything unceremonious happens to Yediyurappa, the Lingayat community will shift loyalty.”

He further said that the Gadag mutt has its influence not just on Lingayats but the masses.

People in the region are venting their ire against elected representatives from BJP for not applying pressure on the Centre to issue the gazette notification. Ashok Chandaragi, a pro-Kannada activist said if the BJP is not sincere enough on addressing water woes of the parched districts of North Karnataka, the the potential to become a turning point in Karnataka politics. There are no elections now, but it is clear that aversion towards the BJP is slowly building up and Congress may capitalise on it, he said. “PM Marendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah appear to have no idea about the ground realities of the state,” he added.

For districts in North Karnataka — Dharwad , Belagavi, Bagalkot and Gadag will benefit from the Kalasa-Banduri project.

Khargone: Throwing an open challenge at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over a debate on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), BJP vice-president Prabhat Jha on Tuesday said that if public supports Rahul even after the debate, he will quit politics but if people support him (Jha), Gandhi should leave politics. He was addressing a seminar organised for CAA at town hall of Khargone on Tuesday.

He said that Congress has been involved in creating confusion over CAA. ""It is unfortunate to do vote bank politics by spreading confusion in the country but BJP has won the hearts of people by clarifying confusions,"" he said.

He said that cases are being registered against BJP activists for organizing rallies in support of CAA but BJP is not afraid of it. Indira Gandhi also tried to suppress activists by sending them to jail. Ones who are afraid of lawsuits cannot stay in politics, he added.

Jha said that Congress had first resolved to pass the law in Parliament on November 25, 1947. Next, when Vajpayee government was at Centre, former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, being Leader of Opposition in Parliament also supported the demand on December 18, 2003. He alleged that Nehru was responsible for division of India on basis of religion and as Nehru-Liyaqat pact was not followed, CAA became mandatory to save minorities of Pakistan.

He said that due to atrocities in Pakistan, minorities have reduced significantly. This law is made to give citizenship, not to take it away from anyone. He also termed removal of triple talaq, Section 370 and passing of SPG bill as important steps.

Mangaluru: Sleuths of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence have affected one of the biggest gold seizures in recent times in this coastal city.

Officers retrieved the gold with the help of a local mechanic and a lathe machine.

On examination by an authorized jeweller, the gold pieces were found to be of 24-Karat purity and their current market value was estimated to be around Rs 2 crore. The DRI officers later seized the contraband gold under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962, Shreyas K M, deputy director, DRI stated.

The active director of M/s Swaroop Mineral Resources Manohar Kumar Poojari involved in the case was arrested in Bengaluru on the same day in a co-ordinated effort by DRI Bengaluru.

DRI Mangaluru officials nabbed Lohith Shriyan, a person hailing from Ashoknagar, looking after the logistics of smuggling. Further investigation in the case is in progress to unearth other members of the syndicate and investors in the case, Shreyas said.

BMC’s anti-encroachment squad demolished 12 illegal shops in Jehangirabad on Tuesday.

BHOPAL: The anti-encroachment squad of the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) — under the district administration’s supervision — razed several shops in Jehangirabad and Gandhi Nagar areas on Tuesday.

106,['15/01/2020'],Madhya Pradesh: Medical equipment in govt hospitals needs urgent upkeep,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Representative image

BHOPAL: Less than half of the 66,000 medical equipment in health centres or hospitals run by the state government are not under annual maintenance. It's no surprise then that 15,000 complaints of equipment malfunction was reported in the last year, according to state government data. Some 44 lakh people depend on health department-run hospitals for free treatment each year in Madhya Pradesh .

Believe it or not, on paper, the oldest ECG machine, being used in a government-run hospital dates back to 1974. It is in used in a ward in the district hospital in Sehore. Of the 40 oxygen concentrators, date of purchase of only 14 machines is known. The device, mostly used in special newborn care units, concentrates the oxygen from a gas supply (typically ambient air) by selectively removing nitrogen to supply an oxygen-rich gas stream.

Madhya Pradesh is the first state to map all medical equipment with a unique barcode . Annual maintenance contract makes it incumbent to have a problem fixed within a week. Also, non-reporting of equipment malfunction leads to action against the hospital incharge. Complaint can be made through a toll-free number, mobile application or system generated log.

However, some of the equipment like mercury-based blood pressure instrument have been not covered under annual maintenance contract. Health department officials said that digital BP meters are being introduced as per directives of the NGT.

For instance, in Bhopal division, of the 1,630 medical equipment accounted for, expiry date or end of annual maintenance of 1,052 equipment is listed as ‘not available’. Sources said in many cases there are no log books or other references to cross-check the manufacture or purchase of these equipment. 790 of these equipment were purchased between 2010 and 2013.

As many as 199 equipment were purchased between year 2000 and 2009. The oldest purchase dates back to 1981 -- one being Mass Miniature Radiography (MMR) in radiology department and two shadowless lamps. All three are in the Sehore hospital. Supply date of one X-ray machine in the same hospital is also 1981.

Bhopal division includes Hoshangabad, VIdisha, Betul, Raisen, Sehore, Bhopal, Harda and Rajgarh. “Some of old equipment are still in use,” said CMHO Sehore district, Dr Padmakar Triwari

107,['15/01/2020'],"Thiruvabharanam procession: Panchayat stops meat sale, sparks row","This story is from January 15, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: A notice issued by Vadasserikkara panchayat secretary — directing meat merchants in Pathanamthitta not to conduct sales on the day the Thiruvabharanam procession (carrying casket of ornaments for special Makaravilakku pooja) passes through the panchayat — has triggered a row.

The secretary issued a notice on January 6 directing fish, meat and chicken shops to stop sales for two days (January 13 and 14) citing the Thiruvabharanam procession in the panchayat on Tuesday. The notice, which was widely circulated on social media, sparked a heated debate on how it affects the ‘secular ideals’ and the ‘freedom to earn a livelihood’.

With the notice snowballing into a controversy, the panchayat committee said that such a decision was never taken.

“Every year, during Sabarimala pilgrimage, certain routine measures are taken by the panchayat. This is kept in a file. When I enquired about the notice, I was told that it was kept in the file and hence issued. The panchayat committee has never taken such a decision,” said panchayat president Swapna Susan Jacob.

She added that there was a previous instance in which an Ayyappa devotee, who took a bath in the river, reported of it being tainted with poultry waste. Panchayat had then conducted an informal discussion with merchants to reduce generation of waste, she added.

Panchayat secretary Jyothi S said the notice was meant to prevent waste generation. “It is a normal practice. We had cleaned up the path for procession and still poultry waste was dumped yesterday. The notice is being misinterpreted. We have a facility for collection of poultry and meat waste, but some of the merchants don’t cooperate and that’s why the notice was issued as a precaution to avoid dumping of waste along the path of procession as it could lead to other issues,” she said.

However, merchants said the notice was being issued for the first time. “The procession passes along 3.5km in this panchayat. We have around 14 meat and fish shops. More than the sale, the notice derails the secular system we have here. What if they try to halt sales for one week next year? This is unacceptable,” said president of Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti KM Chacko.

The procession, which began at Pandalam on Monday, passed through Vadaserikara on Tuesday.

Deputy director of Pathanamthitta’s panchayat directorate Saima S said that the issuance of notice was quite normal. “This time, some people are causing unnecessary trouble to flare up communal sentiments. The secretary only wanted to ensure that the path was clean during a religious event. That’s a peaceful and proper way for conducting religious events,” she said.

Thiruvananthapuram: With an aim to resolve the social issues faced by transgender community, the Kerala State youth commission organized a special trans adalat. As many as 56 complaints were examined by the state-level adalat chaired by youth commission chairperson Chintha Jerome here on Tuesday.

Commission secretary T K Jayasree, assistant Manoj C D and commission member V Vinil also chaired the adalat held at the conference hall of Government Guest House in Thycaud.

Major suggestion at the adalat was about opening transgender care home in all districts. Transgender care home is a short stay home for three months that provides facilities like food, counselling, medical treatments and legal assistances for the community members. “The extension of the stay period from three months was another proposal. Some of them have also complained against mentioning them as third gender in voter’s identity card. They demanded that it should be corrected as transgender person. We have note down the suggestions and complaints. Various complaints have been forwarded to departments concerned to find an immediate solution” said Jerome adding that adalat has been scheduled for another day to give report and solution to the transgenders’ complaints regarding the violence they face.

Laya Maria Jaison from Changanassery said gender recognition is their primary need. “Though Supreme Court has accepted, declared basic fundamental rights and gave us right to self – identification of our gender, we are referred to as third gender in our voter’s identity which itself is a discrimination. It should be corrected as transgender. Another suggestion is that Transgender Cell should coordinate with community based organizations across the state to conduct an accurate survey and based on that just like any other minority community; reservations should be implemented for transgenders which would ensure job opportunities”, said Jaison.

“There should be opportunity for trans students to participate in arts and sports competitions in our own category. At present we have to select either male or female category. Another complaint is, police forces aren’t taking our complaints seriously. It’s been five months since the mysterious death of transgender person Shalu from Kozhikode, police haven’t taken any interest in the case”, said Nadira Mehrin, a student of University College.

Accused Saurabh Chaudhary and Rohit Tiwari’s remand ends today

JAIPUR: The two accused in the murder of the mother-son duo in Pratap Nagar will be produced before the court on Wednesday as their remand was till January 15. While cops are now unveiling more details in the brutal murders, the FSL is yet to give a report on the fingerprints that were found on the weapon used for the two murders.

A 35-year-old woman and her 21-month-old son were murdered by a contract killer hired by her husband last week. The two accused — the woman’s husband Rohit Tiwari and Saurabh Chaudhary, who was hired by Rohit to kill his wife and son — were arrested on January 10. The body of Shweta Tiwari was found at her flat on January 7 while her son’s body was found the next day. Both of them had been murdered within minutes of each other.

DCP East Rahul Jain, who is spearheading the investigations said, “We have enough evidence against the accused and are now in the process of strengthening the case against them. The FSL report is yet to come in, but we are confident that the fingerprints on the murder weapon would match Saurabh’s.”

Police have also ruled out the possibility that Saurabh killed Shweta and her son due to some personal issue. “Rohit was the contact point for Saurabh and there is no evidence to suggest that he executed the crime for any reason other than the fact that the accused husband asked him to.”

Rohit had given Saurabh an advance of Rs 20,000 and at the time of murders he had only Rs 43,000 in his bank. Cops had previously also claimed that more than money, the motivation behind the two accused conspiring was to get rid of each other’s wives though part of their plan was foiled after they were arrested. They could not execute the second part of the plan which involved Rohit killing Saurabh’s wife, said police.

Shweta’s family since the beginning had been accusing Rohit of planning the murders and her brother Shubham Mishra said, “Rohit had been physically abusing my sister for very long and even his family did not intervene. In fact even after my sister and nephew were killed, Rohit’s family did not get in touch with us.”

BAREILLY: In a bizarre incident, a class XII student, who was trying to make a TikTok video using his parent’s licensed revolver, shot himself accidentally when it went off in Hafiz Ganj area of Bareilly on Monday.

The incident occurred in Mudia Bhaikampur village of Nawabganj in the district, Nawabganj circle officer Yogendra Kumar said.

According to him, Keshav, 18-year-old son of Army man Virendra Kumar, had pressured his mother Gayitri to give him the revolver for making the TikTok video.

Keshav was preparing for national eligibility-cum-entrance test (NEET) and was fond of sharing his videos on TikTok. He had even earlier shared his pictures with a revolver on social media.

His father who is posted in Roorkee and was to retire this month-end, refused to hand over his son’s body for a post-mortem.

Suresh Pal Singh, Hafizganj station house officer, told TOI, “The family told us that Keshav took the licenced revolver from his mother for making a TikTok video and went inside his room. Sometime later, the mother heard the noise of a gunshot and rushed towards Keshav’s room. She found him writhing in pain with blood all over his body. He was rushed to a private hospital where the doctor declared him brought dead. The family refused to send the body for autopsy and gave us in writing that they don’t require police. There was no suicide note with the body and the family members told us that their son shot himself accidentally while recording a video. The body has been cremated by the family without autopsy.”

SSP Shailesh Pandey said, “I have asked the SHO to seize the revolver and take further steps for the cancellation of firearm’s license for showing negligence in keeping the weapon.”

117,['15/01/2020'],IIT-Hyderabad adds light and heat to meds to kill cancer cells in novel way,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H), have found that adding light and heat to anti-cancer chemicals helps in treating cancers more efficiently. At present, cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy in which powerful chemicals are used to kill cancer cells.

The IIT team found that adding light and heat, or photothermal therapy to chemotherapy helps in killing malignant cells, providing relief to patients. Called a combination therapy, the IIT-H cancer treatment model involves photo (light) and heat (thermal), apart from the usual chemicals (chemotherapy).

This gives much-needed synergetic impact to anti-cancer treatment currently followed worldwide. Moreover, the chemical used in chemotherapy by the IIT team is derived from natural sources, and thus, has little negative impact.

The IIT-H team collaborated with counterparts at IIT Bombay and Bose Institute, Kolkata, in developing the new treatment regimen. During research, the team found that a synergetic combination of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy had shown efficacy in fighting cancer cells. The result of the research was published in the recent issue of the science journal, ‘Nanoscale’.

“Combination therapy, which combines more than one therapeutic procedure, is being increasingly considered for treatment of cancer because it can deal with the heterogeneity (different varieties) of cancer cells in addition to providing synergic therapeutic effects,” said Dr R Aravind Kumar, assistant professor in the department of biomedical engineering, IIT-H.

The team comprised A Tejaswini, P Deepak Bharadwaj, Rafiq Ahmad Khan, Syed Baseeruddin Alvi, Rohit Srivastava, Mahadeb Pal, and Nooruddin Khan, apart from Aravind Kumar.

While chemotherapy involves use of chemicals, in photothermal therapy material that converts light to heat is directed to the tumour. It destroys cancer cells. The team used an iodide dye (IR780) to kill the malignant cells.

Stating that development of effective therapies specific to cancer tissues without damaging the surrounding healthy cells remains the ultimate challenge in the battle against cancer, the IIT team said that the present methods of cancer treatment such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy badly affect healthy tissues too. “The combined photothermal and chemotherapy holds significant promise for enhanced therapeutic benefits with minimal or no side effects on cancer patients,” the researchers stated.

This led to power struggle between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy Pilot.

Kottayam: The health condition of BJP state secretary A K Nazeer continues to be stable and is likely to be discharged on Wednesday, said hospital authorities.

Nazeer was admitted in Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS) in Kochi after being attacked allegedly by SDPI activists in the compound of a mosque in Nedumkandom in Idukki district around 7pm on Sunday.

Meanwhile, cops have registered a case against five people whom the victim could identify. The move is based on the statement of Nazeer. However, he has not mentioned the names of the five people in the statement.

According to police, a case has been charged for attempt to murder, unlawful assembly, rioting, and causing hurt voluntarily using dangerous weapons. The Nedumkandom police station circle inspector has launched a probe.

Correction: The headline of a related report published on January 14 inadvertently said five persons were arrested in the case. Police had charged five persons, but were not arrested.

BHOPAL: Aarti Dayal, accused in the honeytrap case, was brought to Bhopal and questioned by income-tax officials on Tuesday, a day after another suspect, Shweta Vijay Jain, went through the similar interrogation.

I-T officials grilled Aarti for nearly 7 hours, longer than Shweta’s questioning. Police brought Aarti to the IT office around 11am and took her to the first floor of the investigations wing where she was interrogated till around 6pm, said sources.

Officials are trying to track the money trail and identify the source of the cash and valuables seized from the honeytrap accused . Once statements of all the suspects are recorded, those who had allegedly paid them off after being trapped in the sex-and-blackmail racket will be summoned, say sources.

Aarti is accused of assisting Shweta in running the racket with the help of other accused named in the chargesheet — Shweta Swapnil Jain, 35, Barkha Soni, 35, Om Prakash, 45, and Rupa Ahirwar and Abhishek Thakur. I-T officials have summoned Shweta Swapnil Jain for questioning.

“Officials who paid them off will also be summoned once their names come on record,” said an officer.

Police have concluded that all the accused “worked as an organized group to extort people”. They recruited women of poor backgrounds and used them to film obscene videos of wealthy, white-collar persons, say investigators. The racketeers then used these videos to manage postings and transfers and extort money from those caught in their trap, the chargesheet says.

The ring was busted after the now suspended IMC executive engineer Harbhajan Singh went to police, accusing Aarti and Monica of trying to extort Rs 2 crore from him using objectionable videos. The duo was arrested in Indore on September 17, and the others a day later from Bhopal. Rupa and Abhishek are on the run.

CHENNAI: Top Tamil movie stars may add huge value to the big screens, but they no more matter for publishing houses. Growth of social media has taken a heavy toll on books on Kollywood stars with readers ignoring the genre, which used to be the most sought after till a decade ago. Biographies of movie icons MGR and Sivaji Ganesan besides popular stars, including Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan that have their portraits, do not have many takers. At the same time, a new generation of youngsters are looking for titles on technical aspects of film making such as acting, editing and screenplay.

V Mathiselvan, a publisher at the Chennai Book Fair , said advent of social media and YouTube channels have had an adverse impact on books about Kollywood. “Ten years ago, at least 30 out of 100 visitors will look for such books in our stall during the annual book fair. Of late, hardly two enquire about books on Tamil movies,” he said. Curious readers seeking information on Tamil cinema get all of it online. “Readers feel books do not offer any new information over and above what they get online, on WhatsApp and on YouTube. This is the major reason for the dip in readership,” he added. There is also a big shift in readership with the new generation preferring technical subjects in film production. With multiple movie streaming platforms opening up space for global cinema, publishers said it has changed the perspective on film viewing. K Kishore Kanna, a film student specialising in direction, said youths focusing on film career explore books of translated international authors. “Youngsters look for specific titles to enhance their skills in cinematography,” he said.

The book fair also had a couple of novels that were converted into screenplays for recent movies. One such novel had a portrait of actor Dhanush on its cover from a blockbuster flick in 2019. Some titles on biographies of actors were also available in English.

Meanwhile, a section of writers gave a representation to the fair’s organisers -– Booksellers and Publishers’ Association of South India (BAPASI) – at YMCA, Nandanam, protesting the eviction of a publisher on charges of displaying anti-government books and seeking withdrawal of BAPASI’s complaint against the journalist.

Kochi: The state police chief has informed the high court that the order issued by him for granting access to ‘ crime data ’ to Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS), allegedly for handling police clearance for passport verification , was a typo and that ULCC won’t have access to ‘crime data’.

An order issued by state police chief Loknath Behera on January 10 clarifying the earlier order was produced before the court.

The court is considering a petition filed by KPCC secretary Jyothikumar Chamakkala alleging that permitting access to Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS), commonly called ‘crime data’, to a private entity affects right to privacy of citizens and amounts to failure of constitutional functions of the State.

The new order by the state police chief stated, “Due to certain typographical error, instead of mentioning ‘the access of CCTNS to the POC application of the ULCCS team’, it was mentioned as ‘the access to the ULCCS team’. Hence, the order read 2nd is hereby modified as ‘DIG APBn who is the Nodal Officer of the CCTNS will make available the access of production environment of CCTNS to the blockchain based POC application’.”

It was also stated in the new order that CCTNS data will be accessed by the Kerala Police personnel involved in passport verification work only, through the dedicated police computers installed in the police premises and that nobody else will have access to the same.

Further, the order said, “It is, once again, reiterated that the ULCCS team is not authorized to access CCTNS data or the software. Like any other software developing firm, M/s ULCCS has developed the software only and it is the System Integrator for the POC of blockchain platform and the blockchain based Passport Verification Application. M/s ULCCS will have no access to the data held by either the Passport Verification Application or the CCTNS Application.”

Hubballi: Blood has always been thought to be magical and it proved so for a Rottweiler suffering from jaundice. Roti, a four-year-old female, was given a second lease of life after receiving a blood transfusion from Rana, a three-year-old male Rottweiler.

Rana’s owner Manish Kulkarni, a city-based civil engineer, told TOI Ganesh Naganur, the owner of Roti had approached many dog owners but could not get blood. When Kulkarni heard about Roti’s condition, he immediately consented to donate the blood of his pet.

Manish said the transfusion was conducted at Dr SG Ron’s clinic in Hubballi. He said he is happy his pet was able to save a life of another pet. Rana donated about 300ml of blood.

Naganur, an engineer who works in a private firm, was grateful to Manish and Rana for saving the life of Roti. He said he approached more than 10 dog owners, but none were willing to help. He says Roti is doing fine and has recovered from jaundice.

Manish said though Rottweilers are known to be aggressive, Rana is “a very different animal”. “He is highly social and a people’s man,” Manish said. “In my absence, my father Mohan and mother Meera take care of him. I purchased him as a puppy from a local breeder in Hubballi. He eats a healthy diet and is regularly vaccinated.”

Ron, the vet who carried out the transfusion, said many dog owners hesitate to come forward to donate their pet's blood. He said in the past two years he has conducted 18 transfusions. “The checklist for blood transfusion is not very lengthy,” Ron said. “Any dog of any breed, which is more than a year old, healthy and has had regular vaccination shots and de-worming, can donate blood. Rana was mildly sedated during the time of the transfusion and it took almost 90 minutes to complete the process.”

Thiruvananthapuram: The state government, with the help of a startup company, has created a ‘realtime’ database of individuals and families from around 6,000 tribal settlements across Kerala , thus placing the photograph, geolocation and socio-economic status of every single tribe at the government’s fingertips.

It took almost a year for the state SC/ST department to complete the initial survey, which covered around five lakh tribes people, for creating a database through an android application developed by a Technopark-based startup company.

The database, which is now undergoing a final validation, will be updated regularly. Plans are afoot to create a similar database to cover scheduled caste communities in the state.

Though some chose not to cooperate with the survey featuring 198 questions, it covered almost 95% of the tribal population in the state, residing even in the remotest settlements in Wayanad, Palakkad and Idukki districts. Tribes people with economically strong background chose not to cooperate with the survey as they were apprehensive about losing existing benefits.

About 1,025 field promoters were engaged in the survey. They were provided tabs installed with ‘Geo Sat’ android and web application developed by Technopark-based Mergious IT Solutions, which also provided necessary training for the promoters. The app also has an offline feature to add information as several settlements do not have internet coverage.

The main purpose, according to officials, is to make effective and targeted intervention to raise the socio-economic status of tribes people. The field promoter will be updating information with regard to education, health, job/income, assets and family life of each individual, thereby helping the department to plan and implement welfare schemes and other projects, they said.

“With our application, the department will now be able to establish a management information system (MIS) with ward-level statistics for proper planning and scheme implementation,” said Ratheesh Kumar R, who heads Mergious along with Siju P G and Manu S.

The government now has the exact location and details of each tribal member and photographs of both individuals and families, he pointed out.

The company is currently developing an application for ‘medical promoters’ appointed by the ST department at various government hospitals. “The app will help these health promoters receive information from field promoters about accidents or medical emergencies and arrange for medical care at the nearest hospital. The software will record the patient’s medical history,” said Siju.

The data, which is undergoing a two-level validation (first by tribal extension officers and then by tribal development officers), will remain secure with the department, and will be utilised for tribes people’s welfare and progress, officials said. The information will come handy to identify school dropouts, people eligible for financial assistance and potential beneficiaries under various schemes, they added.

As per 2011 Census, there were around 4.83 lakh tribes people in the state, which is now estimated at 5 lakh.

Deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot at PCC office in city on Tuesday

JAIPUR: A blame game is on between the state election commission and the panchayati raj department over the delay in panchayat elections after the Supreme Court stayed the high court order cancelling two notifications issued for reconstituting new panchayats after November 15.

Deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Tuesday wrote to the state election commissioner, Prem Singh Mehra, reminding the commission that it was a constitutional obligation of the commission to hold the polls to panchayat bodies before their term ends as per the Constitution.

He said after the apex court stayed the high court order, the two notifications issued by the panchayat raj department have been revived. The commission should hold elections as per the conditions existed before the high court order on December 13.

But the commission had put on hold the elections of the affected panchayats by the two notifications under which many panchayats would have no elected representatives after the term of the present incumbents expire. So, the commission had not announced election to panchayat samiti and zilla parishad representatives whose term complete on February 7.

He pointed out that “If elections were not held before their terms complete, it would create a constitutional crisis.”

In order to avoid such a situation, he asked the commission to announce elections to the remaining panchayat bodies.

Sources in the election commission said the commission proceeded with the election process after getting directions from the panchayati raj department on December 16 in the aftermath of the Rajasthan High Court order.

ACS panchayati raj Rajeshwar Singh in his letter to all collectors had directed to reconstitute the wards and complete the lottery for reservations to various categories by December 22 in line with the high court order which was later extended to December 28. The commission has been proceeding with the election process to complete the elections on time. Then came the Supreme Court order.

“It was the department which went to the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the high court order. The top court had only stayed the high court order not cancelled it. We need clarity,” said an officer.

He pointed out that, “There is also a constitution provision that once the election process for panchayat bodies were set in motion, no court could interfere with the process.”

A child flies a plastic kite at Parade Grounds on Tuesday

HYDERABAD: Thousands of plastic kites have found their way into Hyderabad this Sankranti, despite a ban on single-use plastic by the Telangana government. Even at the state-sponsored International Kite and Sweet Festival on Tuesday several people were seen flying plastic kites.

While there’s a big profit for sellers, it’s a big loss for the city’s health as these plastic kites take years to disintegrate and would prove fatal for Hyderabad’s soil and water. “Plastic covering the land can stop water from percolating into the soil. This can stop the city’s groundwater levels from rising,” said Arun Krishnamurthy, founder of the Environment Foundation of India. He added: “And if this plastic is burned, it’ll cause severe air pollution.”

They can also endanger birds and animals. “Many kites get entangled on tree canopies. As plastic reflects light almost like a mirror, it can disorient birds and increase the chances of accidents,” said C Srinivasulu, head, Centre for Bio-diversity and Conservation Studies, Osmania University. And the threat of animals ingesting plastic is always there, he added.

“Plastic kites that end up in garbage are eaten by stray animals, causing immense pain or even death in some cases. The government should strictly ban the manufacture and sale of plastic kites in the state,” said Mirza Kareem Baig, member of the Forest and Wildlife Protection Society (FAWPS).

Amid environmental fears, kite traders across Dhoolpet, Gulzar Houz and Dabeerpura said that the sale of plastic ones has consistently increased in the city. This year, 90% of their profits came from selling ‘designer’ plastic kites, priced between Rs 4 and Rs 200. “We reduced our stock of traditional paper kites this year as there is very little demand. Customers prefer plastic kites because they don’t tear easily even on a windy day,” said Mohammad Rahmat, a 30-year-old trader from Dabeerpura.

When asked about plastic kites being allowed inside the state festival, Burra Venkatesham, secretary for youth advancement, tourism and culture said, “There are thousands of people coming to the festival. If we check each one of them, the enthusiasm will be lost. So, we are slowly trying to make them understand that using plastic is not good for anybody. It is more education than enforcement. Maybe they will slowly stop using plastic, if we continue to educate them.”

He added: “We have at least ensured that there is no plastic being used in stalls where sweets are being sold. We have asked participants to use recyclable material.”

BHOPAL: In a first, Nakul Nath, Congress MP from Chhindwara and son of Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Kamal Nath “attacked” Prime Minister Narendra Modi government for the increase in unemployment and rising inflation in the country in a tweet on Tuesday.So far, junior Nath would usually tweet congratulatory messages to friends on their birthday, greet people on festivals or raise an issue concerning his constituency Chhindwara, but never used it as a tool to attack political opponents. Though, he retweeted his father’s tweet on Hindi film Chhapaak a few days ago in which Kamal Nath had praised the film while announcing to make it tax-free in MP.However, on Tuesday he posted some newspaper cutting relating to stories on declining job opportunities in the country and rise in inflation particularly prices of vegetables.With the # SabMehengaiSI, he wrote- Modi Sarkar Ki Galat Nitiyon Ke Karan (Because of erratic plicies of Modi government): * Desh Mein 16 Lakh Rojgar Ghate (Jobs in the country shrink by 16 lakh) * Picchle 5.5 Varshon Mein Khudra Mehngai Dar 7.35 % Par Pahunchi, Jo Sarvadhik Hai. (Inflation in retail prices touches 7.35 % in 5.5 years, which is the highest.) * 60.5 % Hua December mein Sabji Ke Dam Mein Ijafa (Vegetable prices rise by 60.5% in December)He concludes with a couplet “Aam Admi Ki Jeb Par Kar Ke Prahar So Rahi Modi Sarkar. (After drilling a deep hole in the pockets of common man, Modi government has gone to sleep).Responding to Nakul Nath's tweet, former state minister and BJP leader Vishwas Sarang said, “If he is so concerned about the economy, he should rather concentrate on the economy of MP and not the country, which is in safe hands. But, the economy of MP is in a shamble. The parallel economy based on corruption may be thriving but in real terms, the state government is taking Rs 100 crore loan again. Kamal Nath government in a year has taken a loan of Rs 20,000 crore, which is alarming, and would have its long-term consequence.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73270034,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-462178,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/in-tweet-nakul-nath-attacks-modi-for-shrinking-jobs-rising-inflation/articleshow/73258104.cms

Representative image

MADURAI: Setting aside a detention order passed by the Trichy district collector stating that the authority had passed it without properly applying his mind, the Madras high court has come to the aid of a man by setting him at liberty from prison.

The man’s wife, Kiruthiga had filed a habeas corpus petition before the high court Madurai bench early this year, seeking to set aside the detention order passed on June 23, 2019, branding her husband Sivakumar as ‘sand offender’ and sought to set him at liberty from the Trichy Central Prison, where he is lodged.

The petitioner’s counsel R Rajaraman submitted that the collector had wrongly passed the detention order stating that there is serious material discrepancy. He submitted that in the English version of the detention order the name is mentioned as ‘Sivakumar’, however, in the Tamil version it was mentioned as ‘Prabhakaran’ who was driving the vehicle smuggling sand. Hence, it was not known who was driving the vehicle.

The additional public prosecutor K Dinesh Babu submitted that though the FIR mentioned about involvement of two vehicles, the lorry driven by Sivakumar alone was captured from the place of occurrence. Hence, he submitted that the detention order was passed by following due process of law.

On perusal of the submissions, a division bench of justice T Raja and justice B Pugalendhi observed that when a query was raised by the court whether Sivakumar or Prabhakaran was involved in smuggling, it was unable to get any plausible answer. Even in the counter affidavit, it is not mentioned as to who drove the vehicle.

“A perusal of the English and Tamil version of the detention order clearly shows that the detaining authority has not applied his mind. Therefore, it is difficult to find out whether it was Sivakumar or Prabhakaran, who was another accused in the case drove the vehicle and attempted to run over the officials. Hence, the claim of the petitioner that there was no proper application of mind in passing the detention order is accepted,” observed the judges. The judges directed the Trichy superintendent of central prison to release Sivakumar from the prison forthwith, unless his presence is required in connection with any other case.

131,['15/01/2020'],More areas in Ekm now under CRZ,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Kochi: With the government approving the revised coastal zone management plan (CZMP) for Ernakulam district prepared in February 2019, three municipalities and five grama panchayats have been included in the costal regulation zone (CRZ) limits. Intrusion of saline water into creeks, rivers and other waterbodies due to various reasons have led to these local bodies being included in CRZ limits.

Eloor, Kalamassery and Thrikkakara municipalities and Kunnukara, Alangad, Karumaloor, Kadungalloor and Amballur grama panchayats are the new local bodies which have come under the limits of CRZ, as per the new CZMP. According to experts, increase in the sea level and deepening of riverbeds and other waterbodies due to various aspects like sand mining have caused saline water intrusion. Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA), the agency which is to regulate and monitor issues related to CRZ, entrusted National Centre for Earth Sciences Studies (NCESS) to conduct a study to fix high tide line (HTL) of waterbodies. It was based on the studies conducted by NCESS that more areas in the district have been included in CRZ limits. “We could find that salinity in many rivers and waterbodies is above five parts per thousand (PPT). If PPT is above five, it means there is tidal impact in the waterbody. That’s why new local bodies have come under CRZ purview,” said NCESS scientist K K Ramachandran.

“Deepening of riverbed due to excessive sand mining coupled with rise in sea level led to the saline water intrusion to more areas. Moreover, less rainfall in the catchment areas of rivers, rampant reclamation of rivulets, canals and other waterbodies which act as tributaries of rivers caused shrinking water level in the rivers. This led to flow of saline water into rivers,” said environmentalist S Sitaraman.

Authorities of local bodies are apprehensive that inclusion of their areas in the CRZ will affect development projects. “Now, five wards in our municipality will come under the purview of CRZ. Being the industrial hub of the state, around 40% of the total land in our municipality is being owned by public sector undertakings and other industries. So, we have got very little land for residential purpose. Including our municipality in the CRZ limits will further reduce the space for residential purpose,” said Eloor municipality vice-chairman M A James. “During various rounds of hearing prior to finalizing CRZ areas, we had demanded that our municipality should be exempted from CRZ limits,” he said. There are apprehensions that the development projects like electronic park, a park to house electronic hardware manufacturing units, may be affected. “Our officials are conducting inspections to check whichever areas and projects may be affected. Let’s hope that we will not have to scrap much projects,” said Amballur panchayat vice-president Manoj Kumar P K.

Jodhpur: A 600-metre-long banner bearing messages of citizens expressing honour and allegiance with the Indian Army will be handed over to army officials on the occasion of Army Day on Wednesday.

The idea conceptualised by two youths of the city, Arvind Singh Rathore and Chandrpal Singh Chouhan, is aimed at conveying to army personnel and jawans the respect of the common man for them.

According to Rathore from Blue City Cares, this is a New Year wish from Jodhpurites to soldiers for keeping people safe as well as a recognition of their supreme service to the nation in the face of all odds.

“This is a small token of gratitude to the Indian Army from all of us by presenting them the longest ever greeting card,” said Rathore.

This banner with messages will be handed over to the Lieutenant General V S Srinivas (GOC-12 Corps) at Lt. Gen Sagat Singh Stadium during the Army Day celebrations.

The campaign was initiated from Ganesh Mandir Circle on January 1 with an urge to people to write their wishes and messages for the Indian Army on it.

“Then these banners were taken at many other locations of the city and the messages of the people were taken on them till Tuesday evening. All these banners have been connected making a total length of 600 meters,” said Chouhan.

133,['15/01/2020'],"State’s law suit in SC may boomerang, say experts","This story is from January 15, 2020

Kochi: The Kerala government’s suit challenging the controversial citizenship act in the Supreme Court may not have a sound legal basis, many in the legal fraternity believe. Those who support the move, however, say it is the only option available to the government.

T Asaf Ali, former director general of prosecution and Congress leader, questioned the government’s locus standi, arguing that it is a matter affecting the citizen and a government cannot move the court. Only a citizen can approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights under Article 32, he pointed out. Asaf Ali alleged that the government is playing politics and belittling a serious national issue.

Asaf Ali explained that the government can file a suit only in the matter of a dispute between states or between the Centre and a state, such as those over sharing of river waters, boundaries, tax, etc, A suit must also have a cause of action, which is absent in this case, he pointed out, adding that the govt’s move amounts to fooling the people of the state.

Asif Ali said the impact of the government’s suit is far-reaching and would derail over 60 petitions presently pending before the apex court challenging CAA . “The court would say this amounts to politicization of the issue and is a vexatious litigation. That would give strength to BJP’s claim that the issue is being politicized. It would belittle the importance of a national issue. While the Kerala government cannot file such a petition, as it has no fundamental right by itself; Pinarayi Vijayan could have done so in his personal capacity,” he said.

However, senior advocate TA Shaji asserted that filing a suit was the only solution available to the state government, short of being forced to implement CAA. “As justice Krishna Iyer said in the Maneka Gandhi case, ‘law is reasonable law, not any enacted piece’. When an unconstitutional law is passed, the only way is to approach a constitutional court to declare it as unconstitutional. As the state government cannot file a writ petition under Article 32, the only way before the government was to file a suit,” he said.

Another high court lawyer S Sanal Kumar termed the government’s move “legal adventurism or atrocity on the Constitution.” He agreed with Asaf Ali that a government cannot seek enforcement of fundamental rights, only a citizen can. “Can a state government allege violation of fundamental right by the Union in legislative or administrative relations” Sanal asked. The state government is bound to implement the law passed by the Union parliament and if every state starts following this course, the existence of the republic would be in peril, he said.

NEW DELHI: The “Beating Retreat” ceremony this time is likely to conclude with “Vande Mataram” instead of “Sare Jahan se Achha”, which in turn in recent years had replaced the decades-old tradition of playing Mahatma Gandhi ’s favourite “Abide with Me” at the end of the musical spectacle.

In earlier years, apart from ‘Abide with Me’, the military bands played popular tunes like the evergreen “Colonel Bogey” and “Sons of the Brave”.

“But in recent years, the focus has been to play more and more ‘desi’ tunes. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, the ceremony ended with the ever-popular tune of Sare Jahan se Achha,” said an officer. In 2018, 25 of the 26 performances were tunes composed by Indian musicians, with “Abide with Me” being the only western tune.

Thrissur: Two families were left bereaving their dear ones when a speeding car plowed into a group of people returning from a temple festival, killing four, near Indira Bhavan on Thumpoor-Vellangaloor Road in Irinjalakuda early on Tuesday.

Police identified the deceased as Kottanallur residents Peranpulli Subran, 54, his daughter Prajitha, 23, Kannamthara Babu, 60, and his son Bibin, 20. They were walking back to their respective homes after attending the festival of Ayyappankavu at Thumpoor near Aloor, when the car knocked them down and tried to flee a little past midnight, Aloor police sub-inspector K S Susanth said.

Three of the victims, except Prajitha, were killed at the scene, police said, adding that the young woman died later in the morning while undergoing treatment.

Prajitha was a final-year degree student of St Joseph’s College, Irinjalakkuda. Subran and Babu were daily-wage workers, while Bibin drove an autorickshaw for a living.

Police and eyewitnesses chased the car, and took it in custody along with four college students in the vehicle.

137,['15/01/2020'],"At long last, move to desilt Aruvikkara dam is initiated","This story is from January 15, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala Water Authority ( KWA ) is getting ready to desilt Aruvikkara dam , after a long delay. This week, the authority will invite expressions of interest (EoIs) from qualified contractors for desilting the reservoir, which was originally constructed as a weir across the Karamana river in 1933.

The high-level empowered committee, constituted to review the condition of dams in the state, decided to desilt the reservoir at its meeting on January 3.

As per a KWA preliminary study, around 10 lakh m3 of sand and silt sit in the reservoir, thereby reducing its capacity. “At current capacity, the reservoir can only meet four days’ supply of the city. Once desilted, storage can be increased enough for 10 days’ supply. However, storage is not the main concern with Aruvikkara dam as Peppara dam can also serve the purpose. Due to accumulation of silt and sand, weeds have infested the reservoir, which affects the turbidity and quality of water. Also, since the water level has to be kept at around 46m (above mean sea level) to enable pumping, shutters have to be opened after every rainfall,” sources said.

KWA sources said the EoI has been invited for preparation of a detailed project report, as well as desiltation. The work will be awarded on a turnkey basis, under which the authority will assess the probable amount of contract. The contractor who quotes the highest lump-sum amount will be the successful bidder. The contractor will pay the amount and carry out desiltation, and will be in charge of sale of components, such as sand.

The high-level committee had assessed that desiltation will also reduce flooding on the banks of the Karamana river. As per the preliminary report, restoration of the reservoir’s original capacity will help ward off unexpected flooding in parts of the city during heavy rains.

KWA officials said the tender process will take around three months. Desiltation is expected to take around two years to complete. “Around 500 working days will be required to remove over 10 lakh m3 of sand, silt and other organic matter from the reservoir,” they said.

The initial plan was to conduct a pilot for source improvement. Later, considering the need for proper desiltation, the government accepted the proposal for desilting the entire reservoir.

The water resources department also plans to desilt Neyyar dam, which is mainly used for irrigation.

KOCHI: Five persons were arrested by the flying squad of Perumbavoor forest range on Tuesday afternoon from an apartment at Tripunithura after seizing two elephant tusks from them.

The accused were identified as Roshan Ram Kumar (29) of Tripunithura, Shebin Sasi (28) of Eroor, Midhun T M (26) of Irinjalakuda, Sanoj T A (30) of Paravur and Shemeer K R (36) of Chendamangalam. According to forest officers, the accused were arrested around 2.30pm while they were fixing a deal to sell the elephant tusks at Kumar’s apartment at Thripunithura. They were arrested based on a tip-off from the intelligence wing of the forest department.

“On questioning, Roshan said that he received the tusks from his late father, who was an NRI. But we are yet to confirm it. One of the tusks was found in a half-sculpted state and the accused said that they were planning to sell it through brokers. We have also seized a few knives and a currency counting machine from them. The tusks will be sent for scientific test to find how old they are. The accused have been handed over to Kodanad forest range officers,” said Perumbavoor flying squad range officer P A Jaleel.

A case has been registered against the accused under Section 39 and 40 of Kerala Wildlife Protection Act. They will be presented in the court on Wednesday after recording statements in front of Malayattoor divisional forest officer.

Kozhikode: The search committee for the selection of new vice-chancellor of University of Calicut (CU) is yet to be constituted months after the term of the previous committee expired.

The university and the state government have forwarded the names of their representatives to be included in the three-member search panel to the office of the governor and it is learnt that the UGC has also given the name of its representative to be included in the panel.

According to Raj Bhavan officials, the file for constituting the new search committee is before the chancellor and governor Arif Mohammed Khan and the new committee is expected to be constituted soon.

The office of the governor has asked the registrar of CU to submit the name of the nominee of the university senate to be included in the new search committee and the varsity on December 10 had elected Kerala state planning board vice-chairman V K Ramachandran as the nominee of the senate for the search committee.

Also, the state government informed Raj Bhavan of the nomination of chief secretary Tom Jose as its representative in the committee.

Both Ramachandran and Jose were members of the previous vice-chancellor search committee and it remains to be seen if the UGC nominee in the previous search committee M Jagadesh Kumar, vice chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University, will find place in the new search committee as well given the recent turn of events at JNU.The delay in constitution of the committee is likely to prolong the VC selection process further as the committee will have to once again invite applications from candidates. The delay has come at a time when the varsity is moving ahead with the mass appointment of 116 teachers.

Currently the VC of Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University, V Anil Kumar has been given charge of CU vice-chancellor.

Vijayawada: TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu said that the proposal to shift the capital city was like a tsunami and political parties that support the move would be washed away.

He dared chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy to call for a referendum on the proposal to shift the capital city. Naidu said he would quit active politics if Jagan’s proposal gained public support.

Naidu participated in Bhogi bonfire event organized to protest the capital city move in Vijayawada on Tuesday. Naidu, local MP Kesineni Nani and scores of TDP activists set copies of GN Rao committee and BCG reports on fire near Benz Circle.

Addressing the gathering, Naidu said that he had designed Amaravati as a people’s capital by involving people across the state. He said that people from every village in the state had sent their contributions and many had participated in construction activities in Amaravati. “Amaravati has divine blessings. It has a powerful history. No one could eliminate its history,” Naidu warned. He said that Amaravati has historical roots and people should unite to protect such a capital city.

He said people have showed their anger against the state government’s decision by setting reports of fake expert committees on Bhogi fire. He alleged that the expert committees drafted reports as per the whims and fancies of the chief minister. He said no state or country in the world has three capital cities.

He said that it was unfortunate that the state government had left farmers in the capital city area in deep sorrow on the biggest festival day by planning to move the capital city.

He, however, said that it was not so easy for anyone to move the capital city out of Amaravati as it has the backing of people from all parts of the state.

He said that Amaravati was selected as the capital not only because it was centrally located but has many natural advantages. He said that the local farmers had given up their agriculture land for the construction of the capital and undermining their sacrifice was not justifiable.

Naidu said that shifting of a few offices to Visakhapatnam would not help develop the most backward areas of Srikakulam and Vizianagaram. He said the government should plan decentralization of development instead of decentralization of administration. Naidu said except a few YSRC leaders people were backing Amaravati as the capital.

KOZHIKODE: It has been a cat-and-mouse game going on in Wayanad forests for the last five days but involving a big cat and forest officials in this matter.

Though the forest department has identified the tiger which mauled to death and partly devoured a tribesman inside the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS) recently and had installed a cage trap five days ago to capture it, the tiger has been evading capture.

Forest officials said that the tiger which killed Jadayan (58) of the Pachadi Kattunayikka colony on December 24 has been identified as a four-year-old male tiger from analysis of camera trap images. The tiger moved to WWS from the adjoining Nagarahole Tiger Reserve in Karnataka possibly around three years ago as analysis of camera trap images showed that the tiger was first photographed while it was nearly one-year-old in Nagarahole.

It is believed that after getting weaned from its mother, it had been searching to establish a territory of its own and ended in the forests near Pachadi under the Kurichiad forest range of WWS. The animal has been first photographed in the area in April 2019 and officials say it could be in the process of establishing its home range in the area.

Chief conservator of forests (wildlife), northern region, B N Anjan Kumar said that camera trap images showed that though the tiger was coming as close as 100m from the cage trap which has a live bull calf kept as a bait but the tiger cat is not entering the cage.

“The reason could be that the identified tiger is a healthy animal and has the capability to hunt wild animals on its own and doesn’t need to depend on the bait. Also, the movement of forest staff deployed for monitoring it and for installation of camera traps would also have made the animal suspicious,” he added.

Forest officials said that in all the previous incidents involving the capturing of ‘problem’ tigers, the animals had either been aged, injured or having some problems with their teeth.

“But this is a healthy individual and its presence has been recorded in the area of around 50-100m near the cage but it is not entering the cage. Now we have to feed the animal kept as bait also,” he added.

142,['15/01/2020'],Madhya Pradesh: Congress for local polls through ballot papers; BJP sees ‘agenda’,"This story is from January 15, 2020

PCC office-bearers submit the memorandum to the EC official

BHOPAL: A delegation of Congress leaders on Tuesday met Election Commission officials and submitted a memorandum demanding that the upcoming local body polls be conducted using the ballot papers, instead of EVMs. On the other hand, BJP has strongly opposed the demand.

Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur , Gwalior and 16 major towns in the state will vote to elect their corporators in the next couple of months.

Among the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) office-bearers who met the poll body officials were organizational vice-president Chandra Prabhash Sekhar, vice-president Prakash Jain, general secretary Rajeev Singh and spokesman JP Dhanopia. The memorandum read: “It is an appeal from the state Congress that the local body elections are upcoming, and the last elections in the state were conducted through EVMs. The experience of the 2018 assembly elections and 2019 Lok Sabha elections was not satisfactory, and doubts were raised in the minds of the people. Therefore, under present circumstances, in the local body elections, preparations be made to conduct the election through ballot papers instead of EVMs.”

BJP alleged that Congress is seeking a chance to misuse the administrative machinery and muscle power to mend the election results in its own way.

“Wherever the Congress forms a government or gains majority, they do not react on the electronic voting machines (EVMs) but, when the results do not suit them, they blame the machines. Congress is demanding the local body polls through ballot papers when the party has formed a government Jharkhand with the help of its coalition partner through EVMs. It is displaying double standards,” said BJP state president Rakesh Singh.

BJP, however, alleged that Congress wants to misuse power and rig the polls, which is easier if polls are conducted through ballot papers. “There seems to be only one agenda behind this demand. Congress wants to misuse administrative machinery and muscle power to mend the elections in its favour. The ruling party is taking the state back to the lantern era,” said Singh. BJP leaders also said that ballot papers will promote the culture of booth capturing, long-drawn and a dull vote counting process and wastage of time and public funds. The government does not have a single valid logic for the use of ballot papers and should immediately reconsider its decision, said BJP.

143,['15/01/2020'],37 low performing colleges under lens,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The academic council of APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (Kerala Technological University-KTU) has decided to seek explanation from the managements of 37 engineering colleges under it, which failed to excel in the academic auditing.

The KTU academic council, which met here on Monday, also decided to send a team headed by the vice-chancellor to 10 colleges, which fared very poorly, to examine the existing infrastructure facilities. It also recommended the university syndicate to review the affiliation of these colleges if they fail to rectify the shortcomings.

The syndicate will consider the academic council’s recommendations in a meeting to be held later this week.

Another major recommendation was to place strict clauses for approval of new courses in engineering colleges. For considering fresh applications, the college must have NBA accreditation at least for one course, while for MTech course a college must have accreditation for the corresponding BTech course.

‘Stricter clauses for new courses’

Besides, colleges which apply for new courses should have a minimum average of 50% student admission to existing seats over the last three years. The college should also have secured a minimum 50% pass. Approval will be given only for courses which have industrial significance and job potential, and colleges should submit a no objection certificate issued by the state government along with the application for the AICTE approval.

Meanwhile, a four-member academic subcommittee headed by the pro-vice-chancellor was formed for inclusion of new subjects of industrial importance in all courses. It was also decided to include industry and technology experts in the curriculum committees entrusted with syllabus upgradation.

‘Restructure academic auditing’

The academic council, which directed to modernize the academic auditing on the model of NBA accreditation, noted that currently only around 30 out of the 142 affiliated colleges have NBA accreditation. The recommendation is to restructure the academic auditing so that all the colleges could secure the accreditation.

The academic council also decided to establish a review system which can provide students a last chance for reviewing the marks they are allotted after revaluation.

Rescheduled Exam

The university will conduct the third semester B Tech (computer science) exam on switching theory and logic design on January 18. The exam held on December 31 was cancelled due to a mess up of question papers.

Thiruvananthapuram: There were several vacancies and hundreds of candidates. However, only a few were offered placements. The two-day Spectrum 2020 job fair hosted by Govt ITI Chackai ended on a sour note on Saturday with the performance of candidates leaving most recruiters unimpressed.

“We are disappointed with the quality and mentality of the graduates. Out of 60 candidates we have shortlisted only four. This is quite unfortunate to see the younger generation shying away from hard work,” said Sanal Kumar from Aero Engineering , a recruiter.

A total of 2,113 candidates attended the job fair where 41 companies had advertised 1,600 vacancies. But with the a big question mark over the employability of candidates, most of the recruiters left the event disappointed.

“This is a very common problem. The new generation has failed to explore the positive side of internet and its addiction to mobile games and social media has had detrimental effects on efficiency and productivity,” said Kumar.

Concerns were also raised over the candidates’ ability to adapt to changing requirements in the work environment. “There is a radical change in the work culture of our youngsters. Most are not fully aware of the need to acquire and equip themselves with different skills. As soon as we assign a different work, most of them fail to cope because they are not trained to take on different challenges. These are not things which can be taught at an institute, and are self-acquired,” said Sreekanth Nair of Shivaji Motors.

Candidates with a national trade certificates, state trade certificates and national apprenticeship certificates appeared for the fair. “ITI students are trained on the practical aspects. We provide skill-based training and yet most of the students fail to work hard. This lethargic attitude is eclipsing the future of our nation,” said P Rajan, principal of Chackai ITI.

“BTech curricula are overly generalised and they lack practical training. This is why most BTech graduates fail to land jobs. But the situation is pretty similar even with the ITI graduates. If this generation doesn’t do a reality check, then most of the companies will be forced to adopt automation,” said Pritham Nair of Induja Motors.

Trichy: To overcome the scarcity of big paddy harvesting machines, agricultural engineering department has introduced handy harvesters and appealed to the farmers to make use of the equipment as they can procure it after availing up to 50% subsidy. For operation, the equipment requires only one person and can save time as well.

After the arrival of paddy harvesting machines, most of the farmers started opting for it as it would minimize time and labour. The process of threshing and winnowing of paddy have also become simple with the use of the big harvesters. However, it has some limitations as well. The large size of the machines makes it difficult for the operators to move it to a particular field, if the field is small in size. If the paddy field is very slushy, moving the machines would be difficult. The handy harvester fitted with a motor can overcome these limitations, agriculture officials said. “Farmers can buy this equipment from two companies recognized by the agriculture engineering department after registering their names with the Uzhavan App. The cost of the harvester is ranging from Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000,” a senior official with the agriculture engineering department said.

Hundreds of musicians perform in front of the samadhi of saint Thyagaraja at Tiruvaiyaru in Thanjavur

CHENNAI: On the morning of January 15, lakhs of people will congregate on the banks of the Cauvery to render Thyagaraja’s pancharatna kritis marking the launch of the 173rd edition of the Thyagaraja Aradhana dedicated to the memory of the composer.

At the same time, from the confines of the city, Chennai’s Carnatic musicians will also launch their tributes to the 18th century composer – only it will be online .

With growing interest in the Carnatic art form, digital video sharing platform YouTube has decided to join in the annual celebrations at Tiruvaiyaru by roping in seasoned artistes such as Aruna Sairam , Ranjani-Gayatri and Sikkil Gurucharan as well as classical arts forum IndianRaga to share compositions of the composer as well as tributes.

Aruna Sairam said that on Wednesday morning, she is planning to post special excerpts from a pallavi she has composed inspired by Thyagaraja’s Pancharatna kritis. “I will post this on YouTube as well as on my social media handles – Twitter, Facebook and Instagram,” said the singer, adding that she has augmented her online presence over the past year.

“I want to build a deeper connect with my fans through digital media. In 2019, for instance, I created 5-8 minute vlogs on topics ranging from the tanpura to memories of my music lessons as a child, and they have been getting a lot of response,” she said.

The idea behind joining the Thyagaraja festivities, says a YouTube spokesperson, is to give people from all over the world a chance to be a part of it.

“Interest in Carnatic music has been growing online,” says the spokesperson. “Even sabhas have started finding value in putting content up online. Hamsadhwani sabha has started a YouTube channel among others like Vani Mahal and Arkay Convention Centre.”

Musician Jayanthi Kumaresh, who has 21,000 subscribers, said she has a team managing her social media presence. In 2019, for instance, the veena artiste had launched a web series highlighting lesser known aspects of the Carnatic season, which she said garnered two million views.

“The objective is to be accessible to people in different parts of the world so that people can stay connected to the veena,” said Jayanthi, who will also participate in the tributes to Thyagaraja. “Later this year we plan to stream kutcheris to give people a live concert experience,” she said.

Thiruvananthapuram: The opposition ramped up the protest against the decision of state commission (SEC) to prepare draft voters list for 2020 local body elections based on the voters list which was prepared in 2015. Muslim league approached high court against the decision and filed a writ petition following which a notice has been issued to SEC to explain the grounds on which the voters list of 2015 is being used to prepare draft voters list for 2020 local body elections.

The petition was filed by Suppi Narikatteri and P Hafish. They pointed out that the voters list used in 2019 Lok Sabha elections was in effect and hence it was wrong to use voters list of 2015. Muslim league also filed a complaint with SEC citing impracticality of the decision. The league leaders pointed out that as per Section 83 of Kerala Municipality Act 1994, election commission has no restriction in making use of voters list prepared by central election commission. The decision by SEC has complicated matters and will deny right to vote of many voters, they said.

KPCC general secretary Thampanoor Ravi has also demanded SEC to withdraw the move to prepare draft voters list based on 2015 list. “The 2019 list includes details of new voters and using this one would be more convenient,” said Ravi. He also said that delay in notification of ordinance regarding ward delimitation will cause delay in the process. The draft voters list will be published on January 20. Complaints can be submitted before February 14. Final list will be published on February 28. The state government had earlier communicated to SEC that draft list may be based on 2019 list, however, with SEC basing preparation of list based on 2015 list, the government is less likely to object.

154,['15/01/2020'],"FASTag a must from today, only one hybrid lane for cash payment","This story is from January 15, 2020

Bengaluru: The FASTag toll collection system mandated by the ministry of road transport and highways (MORTH) is to be officially rolled out across all National Highways Authority ( NHAI ) toll plazas in the country from Wednesday.

Since December 15, 75% of all lanes (three to four) at toll plazas were converted into FASTag lanes. But Wednesday onwards, only one hybrid lane in either direction will accept cash payments.

Last week saw FASTag transactions climb to 46% and the figure crossed 54% as of Tuesday afternoon. The scramble to buy the stickers picked up pace on Monday; NHAI authorities say more than 60,000 FASTags have been sold in the state so far.

Despite the government relaxing the FASTag rollout mandate (from 100% to 75% electronic collection), the project has not helped reduce waiting time at toll plazas in the state, claim motorists, adding that system glitches continue to affect its smooth rollout. A common complaint is that often they’re forced to pay twice for the same journey, which occurs when scanners are unable to read the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) stickers.

Initially supposed to be implemented by December 1, the project deadline was pushed to December 15. On December 14, the ministry again deferred the implementation and said the mandate had been relaxed to 75%.

First introduced in 2016 to ensure smooth traffic flow at toll plazas, the system involves the use of RFID stickers on the windscreens of vehicles, allowing motorists to pass through toll plazas without halting.

Free trip if machine is faulty

NHAI officials clarified on Tuesday that in cases of malfunctioning electronic toll collection infrastructure, the vehicle will be permitted to pass without payment of user fee.

“If a vehicle user with a valid, functional FASTag with sufficient balance in the linked account crossing a toll plaza is not able to pay user fee through FASTag owing to malfunctioning of electronic toll collection infrastructure, he/she shall be permitted to cross without payment of any user fee. An appropriate zero transaction receipt shall be issued mandatorily for all such transactions,” reads a notification issued by the ministry on May 7, 2018.

155,['15/01/2020'],New plaint against municipality official at Anthoor,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Kannur: A private sector employee, working in New Delhi, has alleged that a councillor of Anthoor municipality illegally encroached his property and built a path to her home though there is a way that leads to her home. However, the councilor claimed the entire issue was fabricated to tarnish the image of the municipality once again. Earlier, it had faced a lot of criticism over the suicide of NRI businessman Parayil Sajan in June 2019, allegedly following issues with the municipality.

Ramesan Alinkeel said he had bought nearly 21 cents two years ago as he wanted to build a house. A few months ago, when the compound wall was being built, councillor T U Sunitha said that she wanted a way to her house through his plot, he said. “Since I paid for the land, I said I need money and then local CPM leaders asked me to come for a discussion. I met them when I visited home in July-August,” he said.

During discussion she agreed to pay the money in 10 days. She later retracted her offer and the local party leadership said they wouldn’t intervene in the issue, said Ramesan. Later, he built a compound wall in September 2019, despite some opposition.

Sunitha then approached revenue authorities and got an order in her favour saying that she does not have way to her home. “I was shocked because they did not listen to my side and then I approached the court which issued an injunction against her last month, saying that she should not enter the compound. Despite this, the compound wall was demolished on the night of January 12,” he said.

However, Sunitha said she had no role in the entire episode and that the way through his compound had been used by people over the years. She claimed that it is the only entry to her compound.

“I didn’t demolish the wall. I was in a hospital when this happened and I doubt it was a conspiracy by the complainant’s people to strengthen the case against me,” she said, adding that she had requested Ramesan to give her permission to use that path through his compound. When he refused, I had to approach revenue authorities, she added.

Sunitha said she had no issue with Ramesan and hence there was no question of her or CPM threatening him. “There is a conspiracy to tarnish me, the party and the municipality. I will take legal recourse,” she said.

K Jamida, Rafeeq Mangalassery and Jazla Madasseri were to participate in a discussion titled ‘From religious to irreligious life’. But, it was pointed out that those who had renounced Islam (ex-Muslims) were invited for the debate though the title referred to all religions.

“RSS is attempting to evict all Muslims from India and here KLF is celebrating those who are insulting Muslim identity. We will question such programmes that strengthen racial prejudice against Muslims,” said M Luqman, who works with the media department of Jamia Markaz. “What is the relevance of Jamida who is spitting venom against Islam at stages arranged by Sangh Parivar. Organizers have the freedom to invite anyone, but we will object against the spreading Islamophobia using government money,” he said.

We contacted KLF director K Satchidanandan when we came to know about the session and he promised changes in the session, said Muhammadali Kinalur, who works with Risala magazine.

But KLF organizers said it was not right to pick a session from over 250 debates to spark a controversy. “Contemporary issues are being debated at KLF. Sr Lucy Kalappura will be addressing an exclusive session and there are sessions on right-wing politics and CAA,” said AK Abdul Hakeem, one of the organizers.

“We selected the particular topic as we thought it would be worthwhile to discuss the experiences of those who left Islam. Later it was suggested that those who are leading Islamic life should also be part of the interaction. We then included Mujeeb Rehman Kinalur and Muhammad Shameem on the panel,” Hakeem said. But this change infuriated Rafeeq Mangalassery who felt organizers had succumbed to the pressure from Muslim fundamentalists.

“The answer to the issue of non-representation from other religions is not including a Salafi and a Jamaát-e-Islami worker on the panel. Moreover, I was not consulted before changing the panel structure,” he said, adding that he would skip the event as a mark of protest.

Jazla Madasseri also decided to leave the panel. In her Facebook post Jazla said there are people from all religions who have renounced faith and it is not fair to include only those who left Islam. She added that such discussion will only help to strengthen Islamophobia in the current scenario.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: City police have made security arrangements for the Lakshadeepam event that marks the culmination of 56-day-long murajapam rituals of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple on Wednesday.

Over 500 police personnel have been deployed in the temple zone. This includes 13 inspectors and 102 sub inspectors comprising both male and female officers.

The police have divided the temple and surrounding areas into five zones. Deputy commissioner (Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple division) will be in charge of the zone that comprises the temple compound. The zone comprising the area outside of the periphery walls of the temple will be under the supervision of deputy commissioner (administration and crimes).

159,['15/01/2020'],Coimbatore: First water vending machine opened at Ukkadam bus stand,"This story is from January 15, 2020

The civic body has plans to open at least 130 water vending machines in the city

COIMBATORE: From now on, public could collect a litre of purified drinking water by just inserting an Rs 1 coin in the water vending machine that is installed at Ukkadam bus stand in the city.

Nearly one and half years after municipal administration minister S P Velumani announced the plans to supply purified drinking water through automatic vending machines in all the wards of urban local bodies in the state, the city corporation had inaugurated its first such machine on Saturday.

While a litre of water is sold at Rs 1, it costs just Rs 7 for 20 litres if the customers were to collect it from the plant. If the residents want 20 litres water to be delivered at their doorstep, it will cost them Rs 20.

R Lokesh, a bus driver at Ukkadam bus stand, said, “Earlier, we used to request some of the shopkeepers to fill our water bottles as we could not afford to purchase water daily. Now, we have to pay just Re1 for a litre of water. It is really a good move.”

S Krishnaveni, leader of self-help group that runs the project, said they were selling close to 100 litres water daily. “The demand is for one litre water. Now, our focus is to get bulk orders and sell 20-litre water cans.”

The self-help group had taken a loan of Rs 9.50 lakh to get the project running and spent another Rs 49,000 to purchase 500 20-litre water cans.

Krishnaveni said they were talking to shopkeepers in and around Ukkadam to convince them to buy water from them as it was priced very cheap. She said they were also planning to sell water cans for functions like marriages.

“While shopkeepers at fish market and TTK market have already started to purchase water cans from us, others, especially the big shops, are reluctant. So, we have sought the city corporation’s help and officials have agreed to print pamphlets explaining about the project. Maybe, we could gain the trust of customers if we visit them with the pamphlets from the city corporation,” she said.

Krishnaveni said they had to sell at least 500 water cans a day to be able to pay the interest on the bank loan.

The civic body has plans to open at least 130 water vending machines in the city.

160,['15/01/2020'],Bright spot eludes solar powered agri income plan,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Chennai: Solar farms of private companies have been sprouting up on arid lands in Tamil Nadu to generate power, but ‘solar panels’ on fertile agricultural lands too may soon come up if the Tamil Nadu Energy Agency (TEDA) has its way.

TEDA has drawn up a plan to enlist farmers from across the state and supply them solar panels free of cost to generate power. While farmers could use the generated power to run their agricultural pump sets to irrigate farmlands, they will also get to export the surplus power to the grid and earn money for it.

Solar panels with a power generating capacity of 11KW would be installed and connected to the grid in the vicinity. With the targeted 20,000 farmers, TEDA aims to establish a solar power generating capacity of around 220MW. These farmers would join the Centre’s farmer energy security and regeneration campaign, which has aimed to establish 10 lakh grid-connected agriculture pumps across the country.

According to the original plan, the Centre would extend 30% subsidy and the respective states would contribute an equal share for the scheme, with the farmers contributing the rest (40%). Since the Tamil Nadu government is already extending free power supply to farmers, the government is envisaging of bearing 70% of the subsidy to make it free for farmers.

Officials in TEDA, the nodal agency to implement the scheme, have sent a proposal to the state seeking its nod to give ""incentive for farmers"" for the excess power generated from the solar panel installed in the farm and supplied to the grid. Generating power at the farms would ensure quality and uninterrupted supply for agriculture.

""Though irrigation activities will be restricted to daytime, unlike the present when free power is made available at night, farmers could have an income from the excess power sold to the grid,"" says a senior TEDA official.

But, Tangedco seems to be skeptical about the whole plan, especially since it will be a double whammy for it, say officials.

""We tried to convince farmers, waiting for free power, to withdraw their applications and opt for the solar power scheme. But many of them want both free power as well as solar power, and the rest are not interested,"" says a senior Tangedco official.

In Tamil Nadu, 21.17 lakh farmers have been benefiting under the free electricity scheme, consuming 13.064 million units per annum. Burdened with rising debts and losses, Tangedco’s cash flows too suffer due to delayed payments by the state for the free power supplied to farmers.

""We are not confident about the scheme taking off, unless farmers are made to join it and quit free power,"" says the Tangedco official.

The concept is a take-off from the ‘solar pump’ scheme, says Sudhakar Thanikai, director-technical, YanSun Natural Energy. While the solar pumps could generate electricity for around 12 hours a day, the farmer’s irrigation requirement and other purposes was limited to usually about four hours a day, rendering the balance energy going waste. ""Under the new scheme, the government plans to get free land, especially those lying vacant, to generate power. While farmers with round-the-year cultivation may not be willing to give their land for such schemes, those with limited water resources could join,"" says Sudhakar.

In terms of farmers’ income, the scheme looks better only on paper. ""From a 11KW farm, around 44 units of electricity per day can be generated. Even if one takes a liberal 80% plant load factor, each plant can generate 36 units per day. With solar power being bought by the grid at a maximum of Rs3 per unit that works out to an income of Rs108 per day,"" says Sudhakar. If farm usage of generated power and the evacuation expenditure of Tangedco are accounted for, it leaves a big question mark over the farmers’ actual income.

In Tamil Nadu, while officials from agriculture engineering department are claiming that solar power pump sets are a big hit among farmers, numbers say otherwise.

A mere 584 farmers have installed solar-powered pump sets in the delta districts such as Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Trichy, officials said.

N Srinivasan, a progressive farmer from Veeran Arasanpettai near Boothalur in Thanjavur district said in the case of agriculture lands where there is no source of power, farmers opt for solar pump sets, but it is the electric and diesel-powered ones that are preferred, he said.

Vijayawada: The three-day long Sankranti celebrations commenced across the state on Tuesday with bonfires in the city marking ‘Bhogi’, the first day of the festival.

Walkers’ associations across the city conducted special ‘Bhogi’ celebrations and mega-walks. “Sankranti is a festival of joy and fun. A majority of us are from farming communities and have settled in cities. We conduct traditional Sankranti celebrations similar to what is held in villages, and resembling a village atmosphere, to continue the tradition for future generations,” said K Kranti Kumar, a member of Vijayawada Walkers’ Association.

In keeping with tradition, several families in the city celebrated ‘Bhogi pallu’ by showering a mixture of seasonal berries, flowers and sugarcane on the heads of children.

Rangolis were painted on the front yards of houses and ‘gobbellu’ placed by women while ‘gangireddula’ (decorated bulls) were special attractions on streets.

Crowds of devotees gathered at temples in the cty from the early hours on Tuesday. Vedic scholars at the Kanaka Durga temple offered special prayers for Sankranti.

Minister of endowments Vellampalli Srinivas lit a bonfire at the Kanaka Durga temple and inaugurated a ‘bommala koluvu’. Authorities at the temple also invited senior citizens from various old-age homes to participate in celebrations at the temple.

Meanwhile, a section of residents in the city skipped Sankranti celebrations in protest against the government’s proposal to set up three capital cities for the state and to continue with the capital at Amaravati. “Sankranti is a festival celebrated to mark the end of the harvest season. But for the farmers in the capital region who have given up their land to the government, there is no celebration. We have skipped Sankranti celebrations and decided to conduct protests opposing the government’s proposal in the name of decentralisation,” said Pothina Venkata Mahesh, a spokesperson for Jana Sena.

Kollam: Rays of goodness can sometimes cut through the dark clouds of pessimism and pain. The thirty-three 3rd standard students of West Kallada Govt LP School in Kollam have proved that little acts of kindness trickling down from the depths of the heart can have the desired effect.

Their joint effort to bring the plight of Aswin Madhu, who has cerebral palsy , to the attention of authorities, to help him receive expert treatment, has paid dividends.

A letter the pupils wrote moved minister for health and social welfare KK Shailaja . She ordered free treatment for Aswin at the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College’s physical medicine & rehabilitation centre under the ‘we care’ scheme of the Kerala Social Security Mission.

The minister also found time to meet Aswin at the hospital and interact with his mother. She also congratulated R Nila, Aswin’s classmate who inspired the children to write to the minister.

""The kind act of a group of children has helped ensure expert treatment to Aswin,” the minister said.

“Under the care of PMR wing chief Dr Abdul Gafoor, Dr Suresh and Dr Zakhariah, Aswin will get effective treatment. Besides the treatment and therapy, medicines and aid equipment will also be provided free of cost. And surgery will be conducted, if required,” Shailaja added.

It was around mid-December that the children wrote to the minister. Unable to stand or walk on his own, Aswin is also incapable of speech. The boy, who has the growth of a two-year-old, was dropped during his birth, resulting in his condition.

His mother’s hope of providing a proper treatment for Aswin’s return to a normal life prompted the children to write seeking the minister’s intervention. The teachers also wrote a letter detailing the helplessness of the boy and his family.

On receiving the letter, the minister contacted the headmistress of the school to understand the problem. The very next day, Social Security Mission regional director Dr Diana reached Aswin's house and examined him. She was convinced that he could be given a normal life with special treatment.

COIMBATORE: A 38-year-old man has been arrested for circulating derogatory remarks against municipal administration minister S P Velumani and city corporation officials.

The RS Puram police identified the arrested as A Zahir Hussein, of Karumbukkadai in the city. A police officer said Zahir had recorded an audio message, criticizing the city corporation on the implementation of 24x7 water supply and solar plant projects, and circulated the same on WhatsApp.

“He also passed derogatory remarks against the minister and corporation officials in the 10-minute long audio message that went viral. He said the solar plant near the sewage treatment plant in Ukkadam would create a lot of health hazards to the public. He said the plant was deliberately installed at Ukkadam, a Muslim dominant area, to spread diseases to the minorities,” the official said.

As the message was intended to provoke a section of people, based on city corporation commissioner J Sravan Kumar’s direction, west zone assistant corporation commissioner Senthil Arasan lodged a complaint with the RS Puram police on Monday.

The RS Puram police then arrested Zahir the same night under Sections 505 (with the intent to incite any class or community of persons to commit offence against other class or community) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. Zahir was later produced before a judicial magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody.

“Ministers, MPs and MLAs lack knowledge and awareness about setting up industries or their development. Moreover, existing industries are faced with many problems, resulting in their closure. Workers are thrown out of employment,” Rama Rao said, adding that developing the sector would generate employment for the youth.

Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala state commission for protection of child rights has asked the government to take immediate steps to contain the stray dog menace in the state.

Commission chairman P Suresh placed the demand before the government in the wake of a seven-year-old child suffering from grave injuries after being bitten by a stray dog in Kannur.

He said that the government should provide financial assistance to the child’s family for treatment as the child’s face has been severely mutilated in the stray dog attack.

Many times, the stray dogs scare away the children as they travel between their schools and homes. The commission is of the view that the Centre’s rule that the stray dogs should not be killed should not hamper the free movement of children. The commission registered a suo-motu case on the basis of media reports of the attack. The commission sought reports from the chief secretary, state police chief, director general of public education, Kannur district collector, panchayat director and director of animal husbandry within two weeks.

Workshop on child rights

The commission will hold a workshop on child rights in the capital as part of strengthening the child-rights systems. The workshop will be held at the district panchayat hall on Thursday.

Minister Kamleshwar Patel at district hospital in Shahdol.

BHOPAL: Six tribal infants died in a span of 13 hours at Shahdol district hospital in Madhya Pradesh between Monday evening and Tuesday morning, triggering allegations of negligence.

Officials, however, said all these children were ailing and some had been brought to the hospital in a critical condition. There were no lapses by medical staff, they said. Health minister Tulsi Silawat has ordered a probe and promised action if anyone is found guilty of negligence.

Two of the infants had been admitted there for around a fortnight. Two were in the general ward and the remaining two were in the special neonatal care unit (SNCU) and paediatric ICU of the hospital, say sources. All the babies are below six months of age.

Three of the deaths happened in a span of four hours — first, Subhash, son of Jhalumanu Baiga of Harratola village at 6.50pm in the paediatric ward, followed by Anjali, daughter Majhlu Baiga of Kotma region, in the same ward at 7.30pm, and then an infant, Chaiti Kumari, born to Balak Das of Kharla at 10.50pm. A fourth infant Shyam Narayan son of Narmada Kol resident of Amliha died at 3.30am on January 14 in PICU, followed by a fifth — baby Suraj, son of Santlal Baiga of Padmaniya village — at 6am. The sixth death was in SNCU — Phoolmati Singh, daughter of Lal Singh of Bhatigama village — at 7.50am.

Chief medical and health officer Rajesh Pandey said, “Of the six, two were brought to the hospital in critical condition and were admitted to SNCU for more than 15 days. Three others had pneumonia in a late condition. All of them were given proper treatment and assistance of doctors from the medical college was also taken. It is a tragic coincidence that six babies died. On an average, 1-2 paediatric deaths are reported daily at the district hospital.”

Pandey said rural development and panchayati raj minister Kamleshwar Patel, who is in charge of Shahdol, and the collector visited the hospital after the deaths. “A high-level team will probe the incident and submit its report soon, based on which action will be taken against,” Patel said.

Health minister was holding a review meeting of the health department when reports of the six deaths came in. He expressed grief over the deaths and ordered a probe by the district collector and CMHO. Appropriate action will be taken if any negligence is found, he said.

The BJP demanded action against those responsible. “It’s heart-rending to hear of the death of several children in paediatrics ward in Kushabhau Thakre Hospital, Shahdol. I pray to the Almighty to give courage to the family of the deceased to bear this loss. This is due to gross negligence and lack of facilities in the hospital,” said former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, adding: “Kamal Nath ji, how long will it continue to play with the lives of innocent children under your rule?

172,['15/01/2020'],Mohite-Patil takes a dig at NCP for acting against 6 members,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Kolhapur: Sharp differences in the Nationalist Congress Party ( NCP ) in Solapur district have resurfaced with the supporters of former deputy chief minister Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil who voted for zilla parishad president election for BJP challenging party leadership to take action against deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.

Jaysinh Mohite-Patil, younger brother of Vijaysinh, reacted sharply on NCP’s action against six of its members under the anti-defection act. All the six members, who voted for BJP, were suspended from the party with action under anti-defection act being sought against them. NCP leaders have submitted a letter to the district collector for violating party’s whip.

Jaysinh Mohite-Patil said, “We are not weak as considered by party leaders. The party should first take action against Ajit Pawar for taking oath of deputy chief minister early in the morning. NCP should act against six zilla parishad members later”.

Jaysinh Mohite-Patil criticized the party’s leadership by giving examples of some incidents in Solapur district where the NCP did not take any action against its members for defying the party’s decision.

Addressing the media, Jaysinh recalled that a group of NCP members voted for Sanjay Shinde in the zilla parishad election, but the party did not act on it.

Citing another example, Jaysinh said that a few members also voted against Dilip Salunkhe Patil in the election for legislative council, but the party did not take any action against them. “The party should not threaten us”, he said.

Political rivalry between Pawar and Mohite-Patil family resurfaced when six members of Mohite-Patil voted for BJP in the zilla parishad election. Two of the six members, who are facing party action, are from Mohite-Patil family.

The NCP leaders were aiming to capture zilla parishad from BJP following the formation of the Thackeray government. BJP retained power in Solapur despite all the non-BJP parties coming together in the election.

Mohite-Patil family has adopted the anti- NCP stand since the Lok Sabha elections when few of its members had joined BJP. The Mohite-Patil family has played a crucial role in the defeat of NCP in the prestigious Madha constituency.

173,['15/01/2020'],"Promises galore, yet poll season fails to bring cheers to slum dwellers","This story is from January 15, 2020

New Delhi: Even as AAP, BJP and Congress are fighting a pitched battle to garner votes in the name of slum dwellers , proper housing and even basic amenities are still a distant dream for most of them living across the city.

Targeting the vote bank in slums, incumbent chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced that pucca houses would be provided to those living in jhuggi clusters under the Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana. The AAP government, through Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board, even carried out a survey and identified more than 65,000 such families living in 156 slum clusters across the capital. Similarly, the BJP government at the Centre has announced that the DDA would soon float bids for in-situ slum redevelopment to benefit at least 10 lakh people while the Congress has announced that 25-square-metre flats in multi-storey buildings would be provided to such residents, if they are voted to power.

Despite the tall promises and political war of words, there is much concern and apprehension among slum dwellers ahead of the assembly polls early next month.

Manbir Singh, a peanut seller who has been living in Yamuna Bazar slum for over 26 years, said, “This area which many consider to be a garbage dump is our home. Our families have lived here for decades.” “Except a public toilet, we don’t have any basic facilities here. Not even a proper drinking water or electricity connection. A proper house is too big a dream for us. Even my Aadhaar was made when we were settled near the flyover. Those huts were demolished for the beautification of the city. That document is also useless for me now,” he added.

When asked why he didn’t apply for an electoral ID card, he said, “We are already struggling with our lives. If we stand in long queues to bring to power governments that don’t care for us, what is the point anyway?”

The state of affairs in the other slums is also hardly any different.

Sharda Sharma, who has been living in Delhi slums for three decades after escaping from the clutches of her violent in-laws in Maharashtra, said, “No government representative came to my aid when my house in Majnu ka Tilla was usurped by a gangster when I fell sick. However, I brought the guilty to book with the help of fellow slum dwellers.”

Rajwati, 60, from a slum in East of Kailash adds, “No government bothers about our problems, be it the present one or any other.”

Meanwhile, Raju Punjabi, who lives in a shack near Kalkaji Mandir, said, “I got my voter ID card made this year itself. However, I am not sure whether I will cast my vote or not as I have no faith in any political party. Only the new generation can do something for the betterment of people like us. I have faith in the youth. They have to lead the way.”

Kolhapur: There was a lot more brewing than just the BJP’s Kolhapur district president on Tuesday.

After BJP functionaries elected Samarjeetsinha Ghatge the district president of the party, BJP state general secretary Suresh Halwankar decided to jump into the controversy surrounding the new book “Aaj ke Shivaji: Narendra Modi’, which compared the prime minister with the Maratha king. Throwing his weight behind the book, Halwankar went on to say that the comparison was, in fact, an honour to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

Halwankar said: “I support the writer. It is not wrong to compare Narendra Modi with Shivaji Maharaj. The comparison is an honour of Shivaji Maharaj. Shivaji Maharaj cared for the farmers. Narendra Modi has started the scheme for the farmers to pay money directly into their account.”

The statement was made while state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil was sitting on the dais. Patil said that a fuss is being made on the issue which is not directly related to BJP. “Congress never gave honour to the families of Shivaji Maharaj and Shahu Maharaj. NCP defeated descendants of Shivaji Maharaj. On the other hand, Modi and Amit Shah have honoured them. We had a choice of inducting Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati into BJP, however Modi, said it will be an honour to Shahu Maharaj if Sambhajiraje is nominated by President in Rajya Sabha. The writer of the book has remained a member of Shiv Sena for 25 years. The book has been banned,” he said.

New dist BJP president slams loan waiver scheme

Meanwhile, newly-elected district president of BJP Samarjeetsinha Ghatge said the loan waiver by the state government is a bluff and he will organise a protest march of farmers soon. Ghatge belongs to the royal family of Kagal. His father, Vikramsinha Ghatge, was a long-time parliamentarian.

Coimbatore: Two months after the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and the department of mines had sent show-cause notices to unauthorised brick kilns in Thadagam and surrounding areas, the brick kilns are continuing to function as before, said residents and activists from the area.

Official sources, meanwhile, said a state-level team had recently conducted a field-level independent assessment of the region and is expected to come up with a course of action soon.

In October 2019, the office of the district environment engineer, Coimbatore north, had sent show-cause notices to 183 brick kilns in Thadagam and surrounding areas such as Chinna Thadagam, Veerapandi and Nanjundapuram near the city after complaints that brick kilns were mining red earth and causing air pollution.

It was mentioned in the notices that the kiln units were ‘operating without the consent of the board under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act’. The kiln owners were given 15 days to reply why penal action should not be initiated against them and warned that non-receipt of reply would attract penal action.

However, residents said nothing seemed to happen since then. S Ganesh, a resident from the area, who has been fighting against unauthorised soil mining, said their RTI replies revealed that none of the kilns had necessary approvals or permissions. “Without the permission from the pollution control board, the kilns were given electricity connections, which is a violation,” he said.

Pollution control board officials from Coimbatore north said they were looking into the issue and the investigation was in progress.

Official sources, meanwhile, said a state-level team had come around five days ago and conducted a field-level independent assessment of the existing pattern of operations of the kilns and the possibility of modernising them, to control pollution. Sources said they expected the team to come up with the further course of action soon.

Also, a case against the mines has been filed by a group of activists from the region and probe is being carried out.

CHENNAI: A two-year-old girl, who was kidnapped from MGR Chennai Central railway station early on Monday, was rescued the same day at Dindigul railway station by the Government Railway Police personnel after they were alerted by a few passengers travelling by the Mumbai-Nagercoil Express.

The passengers, who noticed the man begging with the girl who was continuously crying, questioned the man. They found his replies unsatisfactory and realised the girl may have been kidnapped and they informed GRP police personnel at Dindigul railway station.

Police identified the accused as Deepak Mandal, 32, a native of West Bengal.

The police officers rushed to the spot, questioned Mandal and confirmed he had kidnapped Rejitha, 2, when she was sleeping beside her mother Marjina from Guwahati, Assam.

After the rescue, the girl brought to Chennai Central railway station and reunited with her mother before the two were sent back home by train. Police said Mandal, who had been doing odd jobs and staying on the footpath on Walltax Road was sent to jail.

A police inspector said, “Deepak who boarded the Dhanbad-Alappuzha Express with Rejitha got down at Salem and boarded the Mumbai-Nagercoil Express. He begged on the train, with the child in his arms, and after a few passengers objected and questioned him, he got off at Dindigul railway station. Railway police there secured him and informed us.” Mandal allegedly kidnapped the girl after a quarrel with Marjina’s husband Hameed.

The GRP personnel said Marjina and Hameed came with their daughters Hajitha, 4, and Rejitha to Chennai Central about 10 days ago where they met Mandal. “Hameed and Deepak used the two-year-girl to beg on the station premises with the knowledge of her mother,” said police. Marjina was a construction worker in the city.

Meanwhile, the city police released the photos of an eight-month-old boy who was kidnapped from Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital on Sunday by a woman. “RGGGH inspector E Sasi can be contacted on 99401 01363,” said a release.

Kolhapur: Toll plaza across Kolhapur will have only one lane for cash payment from Tuesday, while all other lanes will have electronic toll collection system through FASTags .

FASTag has become mandatory for all vehicles travelling on National Highway from January 15. According to an official from the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), the cash lane will be kept open for few days where instructions will be given to the motorists to get the FASTags as early as possible.

“Only 40% of the total toll is collected through electronic transaction at Kini toll plaza on the Pune-Bangalore national highway,” he said.

The ministry of road transport and highways had last month stated that vehicles the electronic payment lanes without FASTags will have to pay double toll. “The penalty will force the motorists to get FASTags instead of paying double toll or spending time in long queues manual toll fee lanes,” the official said.

The government had earlier declared that no vehicle will be allowed to pass through the toll plaza without FASTag from December 1. However, the deadline was extended to December 15 stating it will be mandatory for all vehicles to have the FASTags.

The government again extended the deadline to January 15 and it was decided to keep one lane for collecting toll through cash for time being and once all vehicles have FASTags, all lanes will be closed for collecting tolls through cash.

The girl will be handed over to Shraddhanand Anathalaya

Nagpur: A mentally unstable woman, who was admitted to the Regional Mental Hospital (RMH) in the city four months ago in pregnant condition, gave birth to a healthy girl on January 13.

The woman was found loitering around by Hinganghat police in Wardha district . As the woman, aged around 35, was unable to tell her whereabouts and identified herself only as Pinky, the police had produced her in a court which ordered her hospitalization.

Police suspect that the woman could be from Wadner town near Hinganghat. Cops had even called some Wadner residents to the RMH for identification of the woman. However, all residents denied having seen the woman in their town.

After the delivery, the woman has been admitted to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) while the baby will soon be handed over to an orphanage.

“Many such mentally unstable persons from across Vidarbha are admitted to the RMH regularly,” said Dr Madhuri Thorat, medical superintendent of the hospital.

According to the medical officer, the patient has several mental health issues including dyslexia. She was more than six months pregnant when brought to the hospital. The woman is addicted to tobacco and becomes very aggressive sometimes and because of which the newborn cannot stay with her, said the doctor.

“Initially, the woman had contracted several infections and was treated at the mental hospital for two months. As she was expecting, we tried to shift her to a nursing home at Shraddhanand Anathalaya. But, it became difficult for the staff there to handle her as she used to turn hyper quite often,” Dr Thorat added.

Finally, RMH authorities decided to bring her back and keep in a separate ward. A medical officer having specialization in gynaecology was appointed to ensure her safe delivery. Pregnancy kit was kept ready from last two weeks, the doctor said.

“The woman had a normal delivery and she gave birth to a healthy girl weighing 2.250kg. Both were shifted to the GMCH for further care. At present, both have been kept in separate wards. “As the mother will not be able to handle the baby, the girl will be handed over to Shraddhanand Anathalaya,” said Dr Thorat. The woman will be shifted back to mental hospital for further treatment and rehabilitation.

Kolhapur: After eight days of protest, mutton shops in the city have opened; however, the sellers said that it will take at least two to three days for regularising the supply as they are falling short of sheep and goats.

The meat sellers said that they are ready to sell mutton at Rs 520 per kg. Out of 154 mutton shops in the city, very few had meat stock. The sellers said that they have to visit places such as Sangli, Satara and other districts of Marathwada to get healthy sheep and goats.

Vijay Kamble, member of mutton sellers association said, “For the next couple of days, the supply of mutton will be low as there is a scarcity of healthy goats and sheep in the market. The meat is a perishable product and cannot be stored for a long time. We have to visit faraway places to get healthy goats and sheep. We expect the supply to be regularised in the next two to three days.”

As there is less demand of meat on festivals such as Makar Sankranti, meat sellers have set off on their quest to find good quality and healthy goats and sheep as people are likely to throng meat shops in a day or two once the festival is over. To ensure adequate supply of meat to the customers, sellers have began visiting the neighbouring districts in search of healthy animals.

Meanwhile, some mutton sellers said that the rules of the food and drugs administration (FDA) to ensure the sanitation in the shops will require huge funds. In such cases, selling mutton at Rs 520 per kg is digging a huge hole in their pockets.

“We have for a table made up of steel which is quite expensive. Also, we have to make all the arrangements for disposing the waste which again requires money. We will request price hike of the mutton in next couple of months,” a mutton seller said on the condition of anonymity.

183,['15/01/2020'],HC censures TNPSC over denial of post,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Chennai: Pulling up the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) for its callouses and insensitive action in rejecting candidature of a person under reserved category in recruitment for a civil judge post, despite production of a valid community certificate, the Madras high court observed that the premier recruiting agency clothed with constitutional status cannot abdicate its constitutional responsibility and deal with the claims of reserved candidates in a cavalier fashion.

A division bench of Justice V Bharathidasan and Justice V Parthiban made the scathing observation while concurring with the submissions of senior advocate P Wilson and setting aside the rejection order of the commission dated December 5, 2018 and accept the community certificate produced by the petitioner and allow him to participate in further proceedings of the recruitment process.

“This is a fit case on hand that the action of the commission in rejecting the candidature of the petitioner to be discountenanced outright. The impugned decision by the commission, in the opinion of this court, is borne out of bureaucratic callousness and insensitivity, stifling the constitutional right of the candidate aspiring for public appointment on the basis of socially disadvantaged status and therefore, the same is liable to set aside,” the bench said.

Petitioner A K Anand said he participated in the recruitment called for by TNPSC for the posts of civil judges in the Tamil Nadu state judicial service for the vacancies of 2014-15 to 2016-17. As he cleared the preliminary and written examinations, he was called for certification on October 1, 2018 after provisionally admitting him for oral test under scheduled caste category,” his senior counsel Wilson told the court.

When certificates were produced by the petitioner, it was found that the community certificate produced by him was not found in the prescribed format. Therefore, he obtained time to produce the same in the necessary format. On November 28, 2018, he mailed the certificate through registered post to the commission. However, his name was left out in the list of provisionally selected candidate, Wilson added.

Aggrieved, the petitioner approached the court through the present plea. Allowing the plea, the bench directed the commission to complete the selection process in eight weeks.

Tirupur: Fabric and garment thefts have increased in apparel units in recent years in Tirupur. More than 10 cases including two murders were registered in connection with such thefts in the district.

On November 13, 2017, K Muthusamy of Thirumalai Nagar in Ganapathipalayam near Palladam was found murdered in a unit run by his son in Kavundapalayam Pudur. The unit was providing service of drying fabrics which were dyed in other dyeing units. Police registered the case and found that fabrics worth Rs 10 lakh were stolen after tying the 75-year-old Muthusamy, who was donning the role of night watchman in the unit. Police arrested four accused and recovered the stolen fabrics.

On contrast, S Murugesan, 37, who was working as watchman in a knitwear unit in Anaipudur, was beaten to death after he allegedly tried to steal a few kids garments from the unit on December 25, 2019. Police said Murugesan had tried to steal the garments to gift them to his niece. When the incident came to light, eight employees of the unit allegedly beat him, and he eventually died.

Among other such cases, at least three cases came to light after accused were caught red-handed while stealing the goods. In August 2018, yarns worth Rs 68 lakh were stolen while transporting near Nallur.

A knitwear unit owner said, “Nowadays, the production costs have increased, and so, it may tempt such employees or others to steal the fabrics. In Tirupur cluster, most of the apparel units would depend on other units for one process or other. The fabrics or garments would be moving often, and so, it is always important to maintain proper records along with continuous monitoring.”

A senior police officer said, “All those thefts were involved mostly by employees of the apparel units concerned or of other units who have knowledge about the garments or fabrics. In most of cases, the owners of the units would not monitor the day to day affairs properly, and the theft would have come out only when final tally of goods witness a shortage.”

Another police officer said, “It is important that the knitwear unit owners should inform about the theft immediately to the police once it has surfaced, instead of beating the culprit up.”

KOLKATA: The Class VI student whose head was pierced by a javelin during the school sports meet on Monday is out of ventilation. Doctors at SSKM Hospital, where Sourajit Bera is being treated, said his condition was stable though his left side was still paralyzed.“Bon kothai achhe? Bhalo achhe toh (Where is my sister? Is she fine?)” was the first thing the boy asked his uncle Harish Bera on Tuesday morning when family members were allowed to meet him for the first time since Monday’s surgery.The student of Narayan Chandra Vidyapith in Howrah ’s Shyampur was hit by a javelin during the school’s annual sports event on Monday afternoon. The javelin was removed in an emergency surgery at SSKM’s Trauma Care Centre on Monday night. But the injury has left his left side paralyzed.“He gave me a smile and asked if I could get him a cell phone so that he could play games to get some relief from the pain. My nice is a brave boy. He did not cry once or lose consciousness on way to hospital even with the javelin jutting out of his head,” said Harish.Sourajit was first rushed to the nearby Uluberia State General Hospital for treatment, from where he was referred to SSKM. At the Trauma Care Centre, the team of neurosurgeons wasted no time. After conducting emergency tests and imaging, the boy was wheeled into the OT around 6pm. “The pointed end of the javelin had hit the right side of his head, piercing about 4cm into the brain. The motor cortex was injured, which resulted in paralysis on the left side,” said Subhasis Ghosh, head of the neurosurgery department at SSKM Hospital. Motor cortex is in the rear portion of the frontal lobe and is responsible for generating neuro impulses that control the execution of movement.“He is off the ventilation now and his parameters are normal. But we will continue to monitor him for the next couple of days to rule out infection before we start the treatment for paralysis,” said Ghosh.A team from the physical medicine department was roped in for Sourajit’s treatment on Tuesday.

We will examine the extent of the paralysis once he is out of ICU and try to do our best to tackle the paralysis issue,” said Rajesh Pramanik of the physical medicine department.“Sourajit looked a little worried as he could not move his left hand.

A cockfighting racket at Pragadavaram village in West Godavari district

VIJAYAWADA: Court orders and police warnings have failed to curb cockfights across the state, particularly in Krishna , Guntur and East and West Godavari districts.

Arenas for the bloodsport have come up in the two Godavari districts while lakhs of rupees changed hands in betting on the sport on the first day. The sport, which involves a fight between two specially-bred roosters with small knives or blades tied around their legs, usually ends with the death of one of the birds.

In defiance of the law, LED screens were installed at several venues and the sport telecast to the crowd. While raids were conducted at some places, the popularity of the event in coastal districts raises a challenge for law-enforcement agencies. In Nellore, police arrested nine persons and seized eight cockerels and Rs 27,560 in cash.

Police said punters from various cities, including Hyderabad and Bengaluru, place bets on the roosters. The scale of betting can range anywhere between Rs 25,000 to Rs 2 lakh on each rooster.

Police added that cockfight arenas must have CCTV cameras and the programme be completed by 6 pm. Mandal revenue officers (MROs), along with police officers, have formed committees to ensure no cockfight is organised. Though the police claimed that they are prepared to crack down on organisers, they remain apprehensive that the number of cockfights will increase over the next few days.

Meanwhile, organisers of Sankranti Sambaralu are requested to attain permission from the respective police station by submitting an application that contains the name of the prgramme, the address and consent of the owner of the venue.

Citing animal cruelty, the high court had banned cockfights in 2016. The ban was later upheld by the Supreme Court.

Kolawole Boboye

Thiruvananthapuram: Cyber police officials under crime branch have arrested a Nigerian citizen who is a key member of a gang that has swindled huge amounts of money from a city resident after offering job abroad.

Kolawole Boboye, 26, was nabbed from his hideout in Mumbai following an elaborate investigation. He was brought here on Tuesday following which his arrest was recorded at Thiruvananthapuram cyber police station. He was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.

According to the cyber police, Boboye was arrested based on a complaint filed by a city resident, Nandana. As per her complaint, she was approached by the gang, who pretended as a job-consultancy agency, offering the job of a nurse at Flowers Hospital situated in the city of Dothan in the United States of America. They also offered help to arrange visas for her entire family so that she could relocate to the US along with the family. The accused convinced her to deposit Rs 13 lakh in instalments. The money was deposited to bank accounts as per their instructions. After a point of time, the complainant grew suspicious about the gang as they kept demanding to deposit more money. Following this, she filed a complaint before the cyber police.

Police first took details of the bank accounts in which the money was deposited and found out that they belonged to branches scattered across the country. However, police found out that the emails that the gang sent to the complainant originated from Maharashtra. Further probe into the withdrawal of money from the accounts revealed that all withdrawals were made through ATMs in Mumbai city. Thus, a team of officials set out to Mumbai, under the directions of DIG (Thiruvananthapuram) Kori Sanjay Kumar Gurudin, who managed to locate the accused and take him into custody.

The team that caught the accused included cyber inspector H Mohammed Khan, sub-inspectors Aneesh Karim and Biju Lal K N and civil police officers V U Vijesh and P Anish.

Police said a probe was on to track down the other members of the gang, which include both Nigerian citizens as well as Indian citizens. Police have confiscated SIM cards, debit cards, laptops and bank passbooks, from which they expect to get vital information about the remaining members of the gang.

Thiruvananthapuram: Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) and People for Animals (PFA) volunteers in the city have launched a campaign against the illegal breeding and sale of pets. This comes against the backdrop of two consecutive rescues of dogs and puppies from two illegal breeders, in Chenthitta , who claimed to be affiliated to the Kerala Kennel Club. FIAPO has registered a case against Sarath — one of the two — with Thampanoor police station.

According to FIAPO district coordinator Parvathy Mohan, the dogs in both cases were found in unhygienic conditions without adequate food or drinking water. “On Sunday, we received information about an illegal breeder operating near the Chaithanya Ayurvedic Centre in Chenthitta, and on reaching the spot, we found three female labradors and around six puppies stacked in two cages which had not been cleaned for a while. The mother dogs looked famished. The meat found on one of the plates was at least two to three days old. We immediately contacted Thampanoor police, who helped us shift the dogs to a PFA shelter,” she said.

The second recovery was from a man near Chenthitta Railway Station Road on Monday. He has been given two days to ensure a hygienic shelter for his dogs. “Waste was found around the cages. The breeder claimed that he was unaware of rules and regulations. So we have given him two days’ time to shift the two rottweilers, three pugs and a labrador with three puppies to a hygienic shelter and 30 days to procure a licence from the State Animal Welfare Board. We will register a case against this breeder as well if he fails to comply,” Parvathy said.

According to Thampanoor sub inspector Jijukumar PD, a case invoking Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and Dog Breeding and Marketing Rules, 2017 has been registered against one of the breeders. “As per the request of the complainant, the second breeder has been given time to meet regulations. We have registered a case against Sarath. His dogs have been moved to an authorised PFA shelter in Sasthamangalam” he said.

The cops arrested them from their homes. Police recovered Rs 8.8k, a wrist watch, two silver rings, two cellphones, earphones, a bag, a rug, pens and books together worth Rs 50,150.

A case under Section 341 and 395 of the IPC has been registered at Naidupet police station.

Representative image

KOLKATA: He had posed as an IPS officer who loved shayaris. But then, it was not ordinary when vegetable seller Vinod Ali from Jaipur in Rajasthan started to pass off the shayaris written by a senior IPS officer in Kolkata Police as his own.

As the IPS officer, whose love for Urdu and shayaris go much beyond police circles, decided to initially ignore, Ali did the unthinkable. He used multiple photographs of the IPS officer and began posting the poems written by the officer as his own. The cyber cell finally cracked the IP address and arrested Ali this weekend. But after some initial questioning, the cops did not contest his bail petition.

“I was convinced that he had no evil intention or motive. He loves shayaris genuinely and might have got a bit carried away. I am not one to take this personally,” said the IPS officer when TOI spoke to him on Tuesday.

Police sources said that Ali was asked to reveal the sources from where he collected the photographs of the officer. “He might have borrowed the pen name from a film he watched when he was young,” said the officer. The IPS officer has several published Urdu books in his name.

“Urdu is never a language of a particular community and around 75% of Urdu words have their etymological roots in Sanskrit and Prakrit and approximately 99% of Urdu verbs have their roots in Sanskrit and Prakrit,” the IPS officer had told the police journal Protector some time ago.

During his childhood, the article had stated, he used to attend nashishts (sittings) of Urdu poets and would listen without letting them know that he wrote ghazals as well. As he was not well versed with meters, he was not keen to let others know about his ghazals. He has time and again stated how a Maulana of a mosque near his office was teaching him Urdu for quite some years.

Haridwar: A 21-year-old man, Lalu Prasad, was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly trying to rape a two-and-a-half-year-old girl. The accused allegedly lured the toddler away when she was alone at home. A case has been registered against the man under relevant sections of the POCSO act.

According to sources, the man had come to Haridwar from Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh, looking for a job and stayed in a room close to the victim’s. He had even befriended her parents.

Talking to TOI, senior sub-inspector of Jawalapur police station Vikas Bhardwaj said, “The incident took place around 5 pm on Monday. The toddler was alone at home as her father, a daily wage labourer at a company in SIDCUL, was at work and her mother had gone out for a while. The accused brought the child to his room and tried to rape her. When her mother came home, she found the girl missing and her neighbour’s door locked. After she knocked furiously on his door, the man left the child and fled.”

202,['15/01/2020'],Lobbying on for U’khand BJP president’s post,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Dehradun: The race for BJP’s new state party chief has heated up with several names believed to be in the fray including incumbent president and Nainital MP Ajay Bhatt, Kaladhungi legislator Bansidhar Bhagat, Almora MP Ajay Tamta and BJP leader from Pithoragarh Kailash Pant among others.

Sources said that the state party chief, in all likelihood, would be chosen from the Kumaon region. The party may pick a Brahmin face for the state party president post to balance the Garhwal-Kumaon and Brahmin-Thakur dynamics in the state's politics. “As chief minister Trivendra SIngh Rawat is a Thakur leader from Garhwal region, the party is most likely to pick a Brahmin leader from Kumaon region,” a source told TOI.

Party insiders say that choice of the candidate for the coveted post has deeper political significance for the two major camps in the party — the one led by CM Rawat and the second led by other party leaders. “CM Rawat’s choice for the post is Bansidhar Bhagat. Other leaders back candidates like Ajay Tamta and Kailash Pant. If Bhagat is selected for the post, CM’s position would strengthen in the party,” said a BJP insider.

The decision on the next party chief is expected to be made after the saffron party’s senior leaders — including national vice-president Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, and others — arrive in the state capital on Wednesday.

“After the announcement of the new BJP state president, duties of state leaders in upcoming Delhi assembly election campaign would be finalised,” said a BJP state unit member.

adventure junkies: The first batch of trekkers to Agasthyarkoodam peak comprised three women and 113 men

Thiruvananthapuram: The first batch of trekkers , comprising three women and 113 men , to Agasthyarkoodam this year started journey from Bonacaud on Tuesday. They are among the 3,600 people, including two foreigners, who were able to register for the most sought-after wild trekking in the state.

Though the forest department had stated that there wouldn’t be any special facility for women trekkers, 170 women have registered for this year’s two-day trekking trip to the 1868 metre-tall peak which will be on till February 18. The trekking was opened to women last year, which saw 103 women joining the annual trekking event.

The registration had begun on January 8, and like during previous years, the booking got closed in a couple of hours, leaving scores of trekkers and nature lovers disappointed.

The first batch started off from the forest picket station at Bonacaud, and a guide each is leading 10-member groups.

As many as 32 specially-trained guides will be on duty to facilitate the annual trip into this natural habitat of rare medicinal herbs and other flora and fauna, which has been added to Unesco’s list of ‘World Network of Biosphere Reserves’. The department has also ensured round-the-clock service of two women forest staff members at the Athirumala base camp.

Entry has been limited to trekkers aged above 14 years, as the trekking features a difficult forest trail and a continuous presence of wild animals. Wayside shelters have been arranged at Lathimotta, Karamanayar, Attayar and Ezhumadakkantheri, besides at Athirumala, from where the steep 8km-climb to Agasthyarkoodam peak would begin after an overnight stay.

Canteens have been arranged at Bonacaud picket station and at Athirumala base camp.

The registered trekkers have to bring the printout of the ticket and a photo identity card, and should reach Bonacaud forest picket station at 7am on their allotted trekking day. The visitors are allowed to start their trekking between 7am and 11am, and they are not allowed bring offerings, plastic, alcohol and other banned substances like cigarettes. Cooking is also not allowed inside the forest.

Dehradun: While speculations are rife for a cabinet expansion in Uttarakhand — to fill up three vacant positions — the state government on Tuesday accorded state minister status to 10 BJP leaders. All have been given key positions in different boards and councils.

Rajveer Singh and Vishwas Dabar have been given post of chairman, whereas the remaining eight were accorded positions of vice-chairperson.

Recently, CM Trivendra Singh Rawat had hinted at a cabinet expansion by saying that the “need was being felt.” With budget due in February, possibilities of expansion and finance ministry being given to a senior leader are high. After the demise of Prakash Pant, the CM has been looking after the charge of finance ministry.

According to the list announced by the state government, Rajveer Singh has been made chairman of state seeds and organic products certification agency and Vishwas Dabar was given charge of chairman of housing and development council.

Bahadur Singh Bisht was made vice-chairperson of state higher education development committee, Atar Singh Aswal the vice-chairman of irrigation advisory committee and Atar Singh Tomar has also been made vice-chairperson of irrigation advisory committee.

Shobha Ram Prajapati has been made chairperson of Maati Kala Kendra, Fakir Ram Tamta has been given key charge of vice-chairman of social welfare projects monitoring committee, Khem Pal Singh was made vice-chairman of backward category welfare council.

Karan Bohra has been named vice-chairperson of van panchayat advisory committee and Sunil Chauhan was made vice-chairman of organic products council.

With BJP expected to announce its new party chief on January 16, the decks have been cleared for cabinet expansion. While a party senior is expected to be made the state chief, three others would be accommodated in the state cabinet.

Munna Singh Chauhan, Bansidhar Bhagat, Mahendra Bhatt, Pushkar Dhami and Bishan Singh Chuphal are being regarded the frontrunners for the cabinet berth.

205,['15/01/2020'],NMC’s garden dept under scanner for hiring agency to plant saplings,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Newly planted saplings at Neeri Road

Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) garden department has come under the scanner for hiring an agency to plant 11,200 saplings across the city at a cost of Rs4.94 crore.

In other words, the NMC is spending around Rs4,400 for planting one sapling and maintaining it for two years. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) also appointed a private agency for planting 87,113 saplings along the Nagpur-Hyderabad national highway with maintenance for five years. It is spending around Rs1,897 per sapling. The difference in the cost and maintenance tenure between the two agencies is alarming.

In September 2019, following a nod from the standing committee and the general body, the NMC had entrusted M/s Rainbow Greeners to plant 11,200 saplings (12 feet high) along 56 roads.

According to the proposal, the firm was to take care of the maintenance of the saplings for two years against a payment of Rs4.94 crore.

Sources alleged that the terms and conditions of the project were formulated to favour the company.

A vigilant Nagpurian, Darshan Maheswari, procured documents from NHAI which said that it paid Rs10.61 crore to an agency to plant 87,113 saplings on the Nagpur-Hyderabad national highway or Rs1,216.81 per sapling. The firm was to maintain the saplings for five years. Maheshwari shared the NHAI documents with TOI. He pointed out that comparatively, NMC is paying more money to the firm which will maintain the trees only for two years, while NHAI’s contractor is doing it for five years.

Municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar assured to look into the issue raised by Maheshwari. “Though the work order to the firm has already been issued, I will cross check the rates of both NMC and NHAI. The payment to be made to the firm will be subject to the survival of the plants,” he said.

Meanwhile, the civic administration has made it mandatory for the private firm to obtain a no objection certificate (NOC) from its public works department for planting saplings.

The civic chief issued the order after complaints from motorists which led to a spot inspection on Neeri Road where the firm dug pits just over the pipeline. The pits were left open for almost eight days, without carrying out any plantation work.

“The firm will now have to get an NOC from the office of superintendent engineer (PWD) Manoj Talewar for shortlisting the ideal spots for planting saplings alongside cement roads across the city,” said the civic chief.

The administration has also set a 48-hour deadline for the firm to restore the road after planting saplings.

Coimbatore: Many devotees of the Perur Patteeswarar temple, who regulalrly visit one of oldest temples in the district, have alleged that the employees of the parking lot at the temple were charging excess fee.

One of the devotees said ticket sellers sometimes levy Rs 50 for a four-wheeler and Rs 20 for a two-wheeler, which is expensive than malls and multiplexes on a weekend. Often ticketing receipts do not mention the fee, they said.

A senior official in the HR&CE (Hindu religious and charitable endowments) department said the actual charges at the temple were Rs 20 for four-wheelers and Rs 50 only for buses.

State secretary of the Tamil Nadu Vivasaigal Sangam P Kandasamy, who visited the temple in a four-wheeler last week, said he paid Rs 50 as parking charge. “However, the receipt the man at the parking stand gave me was a torn piece of paper without mentioning the charge,” he said, adding that it was a weekday too.

Consumer activist V Jayaraman recalled that while visiting the temple last year, he paid Rs 20 to park his two-wheeler.

People living in and around the temple also said the parking employees had charged Rs 50 for four-wheelers earlier. “A few of the men at the parking lot have charged Rs 50 for four-wheelers,” said Sri Ramesh, a resident living near the temple.

“Parking contractors should display charges on a board. But it was not always followed,” said Jayaraman, who heads Coimbatore Consumer Club.

Parking stand contractor Srinivasan, who also runs parking stands at multiple theatres, admitted that the charges were Rs 5 for two-wheelers, Rs 20 for four wheelers and Rs 50 for small buses and vans and Rs 100 for buses. “I will investigate into complaints immediately and take action. Maybe there was a miscommunication, but if there is any wrongdoing, I will take action and ensure such high charges are not levied again,” he said.

Madurai: Madras high court has dismissed a physical education teacher’s plea to be included in the promotion panel saying he had obtained his MA degree through open university which is invalid according to University Grants Commission (UGC) regulations. Petitioner I Sundararajan had passed SSLC in 1974 and also completed a certificate court in physical education in 1979. He was appointed as physical education teacher in a government high school at Periyakovilankulam in Tirunelveli in 1988. He obtained MA degree under open university system in 1999 without having any basic degree which was an essential qualification for joining a postgraduate course. However, with the MA degree, he obtained a Bachelor of Physical Education (B.P.Ed) in 2001. The joint director of school education department sent a communication to all chief educational officers to send the seniority list of physical education teachers for promotion to the post of physical education director grade II. Since his name was not in the list, he inquired about it. The joint director sent a communication on May 17, 2010 informing him that he was ineligible on the ground that he did not have a general qualification of a bachelor’s degree. The petitioner challenged the communication before the HC Madurai bench in 2010 and sought to consider his promotion without insisting on the general qualification of a bachelor’s degree.

On perusal of the submissions,court observed that the petitioner had obtained MA through open university system without plus two qualification or basic degree. The judge said the BPEd degree obtained by Sundararajan though a summer course was also not valid under UGC regulations. In this regard, the judge referred to a Supreme Court verdict in 2009 which held that a postgraduate degree obtained through distance education programme in contravention of UGC regulations is not valid. Hence, as contended by the authorities, the petitioner who does not possess a basic degree is not eligible to show his BPEd degree to get promotion.

Madurai: In order to drivers from dozing off and to prevent accidents, especially during the Pongal season as many are involved in hectic schedule, officials from the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) have started serving tea and biscuits to them.

Drivers are stopped at Batlagundu toll gate and are served with tea between 1am an 5am starting from Monday. Officials said that drivers feel sleepy between this particular timing and even a second of lapse in concentration may prove fatal to many.

The initiative was taken based on instructions from the managing director of TNSTC, Madurai Region, M A Murugesan. Officials said that apart from bus drivers, private car drivers and van drivers are also served with tea and biscuits. They are also sensitized on how to drive safely. Pilgrims, who are on foot to Palani are also sensitized by issuing pamphlets. TNSTC general manager for Dindigul district N Ganesan has been deploying a team of employees to distribute tea and create awareness on a rotation basis.

Due to Ayyappa season and Pongal holidays traffic on the Dindigul-Kumuli highway has increased. With the road becoming busier, it has increased risk to the commuters using the road.

MADURAI: A hoax call , threatening of a bomb planted in a bus terminal in Madurai city and the Avaniapuram jallikattu event on Wednesday, kept the city police on their toes on Tuesday.

As soon as the call was received at the Chennai control room early on Tuesday morning, teams were swung into action in all the bus terminals like Mattuthavani, Periyar and Arappalayam. Another team was dispatched to Avaniapuram to ensure there is no threat to the venue. Dog squads were also swung into action. The terminals and jallikattu venue were thoroughly combed by the teams consisting of bomb detection and disposal squad and police personnel.

Later, a large number of police officers and personnel were deployed for security measures and traffic arrangement for the jallikattu event.

A police officer said that in Mattuthavani, the search, which began at around 6am ended at 10.30am after thoroughly checking all the platforms, buses and passenger bags. The search created a buzz in the busy terminal, which was overcrowded on Tuesday as people were leaving for their native to celebrate Pongal. Similar searches were conducted in other terminals as well. As the city police did not find anything suspicious, they declared that the call was hoax.

Meanwhile, a box found under suspicious circumstances under a railway bridge in Ellis Nagar, created panic in the locality. Through the local police, a BDDS team was alerted. While the area was corned off by the police, a BDDS team rushed there and conducted a check. After a thorough check, the team announced that it was only a tiffin box left behind by someone.

Meanwhile, an inquiry was underway to find out the miscreant, who had made the hoax call.

M K Stalin

CHENNAI: The DMK on Tuesday warned of a “massive protest” against the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register if the AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu remained silent.

In a statement, DMK president M K Stalin said chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and revenue minister R B Udayakumar had said the state would not implement the NRC. “But the government is silent on NPR. Once NPR details are collected, it will lead to the NRC and people will suffer,” said Stalin.

The DMK chief said the CM and the minister accused opposition parties of unnecessarily raising the issue when it was taken up by Stalin in the assembly last week. “We wanted a resolution to be passed in the assembly against the CAA . But the AIADMK government is afraid of passing such a resolution against the Centre,” said Stalin. While all other states (Bihar, Assam, West Bengal) are opposing the move, the AIADMK government is silent and is in favour of implementing the NPR, said Stalin.

213,['15/01/2020'],"FASTag deadline ends, but only 40% vehicles using new system","This story is from January 15, 2020

Madurai: The deadline for the implementation of FASTag by the Union road transport ministry ended on Tuesday, but only less than 40% of vehicles using toll plazas in southern districts are using the new system. However, officials claim that the collection of toll amount through FASTag has crossed the 50% mark in Kappalur plaza and 40% mark in the remaining plazas .

At present, 25% of the lanes have been reserved for non-FASTag vehicles. While the deadline, which was extended by a month time ends on Tuesday night, only one lane on each side will be reserved for non-FASTag vehicles from Wednesday if no relaxation is given by the government. Highway users say that while FASTag lanes are free, other lanes are still crowded hindering fast movement.

U Vigayaragavan, a resident of Nagamalai Pudukottai said, “Many like me are not willing to take it up at least for now. I have been hearing about various discrepancies like FASTag not getting read at some toll plazas and deduction of double amount. I will wait for some more time before taking a call.”

Sources from Kappalur toll plaza said that while most commercial vehicles like trucks have come into the system, car owners are still reluctant. Less than 40% of the cars have got the tags fixed. They prefer to use cash payment. FASTags, which were in demand one month ago, are now freely available, as people are reluctant to come forward to buy them.

Project director of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Madurai, said that there is a good improvement in terms of money collection through FASTag. Marshals have been deployed to guide vehicles to use correct lanes at all toll plazas, he added.

Apart from Kappalur in Madurai district, there are five more toll plazas in southern districts located at Kodai Road, Sattur, Kayathar and Nanguneri. Although Chittampattti plaza is in Madurai district, it is managed by NHAI, Trichy.

Coimbatore: In a way to celebrate the harvest festival, the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University has released two drought tolerant varieties of rice, a new variety of cotton, which allows dense planting and mechanized cutting, and new varieties of six vegetables. A total 13 new varieties—seven agriculture and six horticulture crops were released.

Calling it a Pongal gift to farmers in the state, the TNAU said the new varieties are aimed to suit climate change, drought, acute labour shortage and farm mechanization, while sustaining farm productivity and profitability.

The two rice varieties are CO 53 and ADT 54. While CO 53 is suited for dry and semi dry conditions, the ADT 54 is suited for the late samba or thaladi season under irrigated conditions. “With many districts frequently facing drought and having to deal with delay in release of water from dams, these varieties are ideal in such situations,” said a TNAU press statement.

The university has also developed a new version of zero monopodia cotton CO 17, which is suited to mechanized harvesting and high-density planting. This variety will produce bolls close to the main stem, so the plant is more compact and sunlight will reach all the bolls. “When the plants are more compact, farmers can plant cotton stems densely. It also allows for mechanized cutting and harvesting reducing dependence on labour,” said K Subramanian, TNAU’s director of research.

In millets, two varieties, sorghum Co 32 and Tenai ATL 1, will improve the nutritional security among children. These are nutricereals rich in micronutrients especially iron and zinc that are essential for pregnant women and children. As these crops require less input, they can be recommended for doubling the farmers’ income. Further, stover can be used as the roughage or dry fodder.

Among vegetables, they have released six new varieties including banana CO 2, tomato hybrid CO 4, aggregatum onion CO 6, cassava YTP 2, manila tamarind PKM-MT 2 and manathakkali CO 1. “While banana CO2 is nematode and wilt tolerant, the YTP 2 cassace is tolerant to mosaic diseases and has shown a high tuber yield with a starch content of 30%,” said Dr Subramanian. The tomato hybrid (CO 4) is known to produce 27% higher fruit yield than other hybrids, besides having long shelf-life and high acidity. The aggregatum onion also possesses a long-shelf life, said the statement.

Further, the red aril manila tamarind (PKM 2) is a high-value crop in the market and drought tolerant. It costs Rs 150 to Rs 200 in the market and is highly recommended in Ramanathapuram, Tuticorin, Virudhunagar and Sivaganga districts. Manathakkali CO 1 is a highly valuable medicinal plant which has many properties including rich in vitamin B complex and a curative property against mouth lesions.

Several open drainages are visible on the road

Nagpur: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is facing severe criticism for constructing cement road beneath the Y-shaped Sadar flyover. Residents and shopkeepers on the stretch have pointed out many flaws, substandard and incomplete work on this road.

“We have been suffering from open underconstruction drainage and stormwater drain from August 2019. Our building Sai Krupa Towers is situated near Regional Mental Hospital Square on the NH69, on which construction for flyover from Liberty Square to Mental Hospital Square started in March 2017,” said a miffed resident of Mankapur Rashi Jain.

“The entire road is being reconstructed by the NHAI. Because of the ongoing works, not just the motorists but residents also suffered a lot. We had to bear with loud noises from heavy machineries used for construction even at nights and wee hours apart from bad road right in front of the building for months. Our vehicles got damaged and there have been accidents too,” said Jain.

“While the road construction was going on, pathway in front of my building was dismantled for the work of a drainage line. The road is now almost complete but the authorities seem to have forgotten about the drainage line. The dismantled pathway till the entrance of the building has been left as it is. Now that the road is ready, no one is giving a thought about the plight of the people residing in the building,” she said.

TOI visited the spot and found that the residents can neither enter the building easily nor can they park their vehicles without causing more damage to them. “The open drainage has not just created problems for pedestrians and inconvenienced vehicle owners, it has also posed some serious health issues like malaria and dengue,” the residents complained.

A few people have even fallen in the drain and yet the authorities have turned a blind eye to the problem. “It has been months that we are suffering,” said the residents.

TOI also found that I-blocks used on the footpath have not been fixed properly.

Vinod Nangia, a shop owner on Residency Road, claimed the footpath constructed during IRDP ( integrated road development project ) work was of good quality. But the newly laid footpath is of very poor quality, he said. Nangia also pointed out that barricading of the divider alongside pillars of the flyover has narrowed down the road. At least on every alternate side of the flyover pillars, it could have been kept open for parking of vehicles. “We (shopkeepers) had suggested this, but in vain,” he pointed out.

When contacted by TOI, project director of NHAI, Abhijit Jichkar, assured to look into the matter.

Representative image

PANAJI: Goa may soon get legislation that allows institutes affiliated to private and deemed universities to set up campuses in the state. The directorate of higher education has recently framed the private universities bill and the draft is now with the state government.

Educationists said that allowing other universities to set up extension campuses in Goa will help in offering currently unavailable courses to students in areas. It will also boost competitiveness and help raise standards. Educationists, however, cautioned that the law should be drafted in a manner that does not harm interests of Goa University . The legislation should also prevent these private institutes from turning into commercial centres, they said.

Sources said that already there are around five proposals from private and deemed universities pending with the state to set up campuses in Goa.The proposals to set up new institutes include a medical college and a hotel management institute.

As there is a demand for these programmes in the state, it was felt that such proposals could be considered and a legislation governing their establishment should be in place, sources said.

“Just because a university is public funded does not guarantee accountability, like if their students are getting sufficient placements. The prosperity of the education sector cannot be harmed by more competition. In the future, the entry of private institutes will become inevitable. At times, it is not possible for the state government financially to offer the entire variety of programmes and that is when the private universities can come in,” educationist Prabhakar Timble said.

He said that it only has to be ensured that the legislation is framed in a manner where it ensures that surplus funds are pumped back into the educational institute. “The law has to be drafted in a manner that ensures that surplus funds do not go back to business families or business houses and that the surplus is reinvested into the educational institutes,” Timble said.

A member of the Goa University executive council, Louis Vernal, said that many students are now willing to pay higher in exchange for better educational facilities in Goa.

“Many Goan students are already going outside the state by paying higher costs to study. In principle, it is good to have programmes by other universities in Goa because the government does not have the finances to fund all courses,” he said. “But it should be seen that Goa University’s interests are not harmed. Goa University is bound by rules like domicile for faculty recruitment, which is not letting it hire faculty from outside. The private institutes, on the other hand, will not be bound by such rules and will have an edge over GU,” Vernal added.

Madurai: The meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Chinese president Xi Jinping would not have taken place in Mamallapuram if law and order was not under control in the state, information and publicity minister Kadambur C Raju said. He was talking to reporters in Perunkulam in Tuticorin district on Tuesday.

The minister was responding to senior BJP leader Pon Radhakrishnan’s allegations that law and order maintenance was poor in the state and that Tamil Nadu is turning out to be safe haven for terrorists. Raju said that the former union minister should be aware of the Centre ranking Tamil Nadu the best in law and order after studying various parameters. The minister counter asked if there was any terror attacks in the state during the said period.

He termed the murder of SSI Wilson at Kaliyakkavilai in Kanyakumari district unortunate and compared it with the killing of soldiers on country’s borders. “We should see how quickly our government has reacted to the incident despite Kaliyakkavilai located on Kerala border. The terrorists came from that state,” he added.

On DMK boycotting the anti-CAA meeting chaired by Congress leader Sonia Gandhi in Delhi, he said that the explanation given by chief minister and revenue minister in assembly that AIADMK would first voice against CAA if it attacked minorities could have changed the opposition’s views.

“Many other opposition parties boycotted the Congress meeting against CAA,” he said.

Coimbatore: A growing number of city colleges and schools have joined in the tradition of celebrating Pongal, which was earlier restricted a few colleges. Many have begun celebrating the harvest festival, as part of efforts to ensure that their students remain in touch with Tamil festivities and customs.

After Sri Sakthi Engineering College organized a three-day livestock festival ahead of Pongal on Tuesday, Sri Ramakrishna College of Arts and Science celebrated the festival by organizing a pongal making competition within their departments.

The challenge was to make the best pongal in the traditional manner using mud pots and fire wood. “This is to ensure that the youth, who usually stays indoors or watches television while their mothers make Pongal, to learn to do it in the traditional way and realise the importance of it,” said a college official.

This was followed by traditional games including rangoli competitions, tug of war and a slow cycle race to see who could maintain balance while cycling at the minimum speed. It was followed by a traditional pattimandram (debate) on whether today’s youth and student culture would eventually turn out to be a celebration or destruction for life in the future. It was moderated by debater Kavitha Jawahar.

Students of Karpagam Academy of Higher Education also celebrated Pongal on their college premises.

220,['15/01/2020'],Export incentive cut hits Tamil Nadu’s matchbox makers hard,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Madurai: The cut in export incentive from 4% to 1.5% has upset manufacturers and exporters of matchbox in Tamil Nadu, its production hub in the country. Since 30% of the match box produced is exported, they say this will be a major blow for the industry.

Tamil Nadu Match Manufacturers Association secretary G Kathiravan said more than 90% of the matchbox export from the state is through Tuticorin port and the rest from Chennai. The total export value is estimated to be about Rs 400 crore to Rs 450 crore with African countries importing 50% of it and Middle-East and South American countries 25%. “On an average 200 containers is exported through Tuticorin every month,” he said.

He said the export incentive was 7% when Pranab Mukherjee was finance minister. “This was reduced to 4% during P Chidambaram’s term after 2012. While we were seeking an increase, it has now been reduced to 1.5%” he said. Kathiravan said that the 4% incentive was given under two heads. It included the 1.5% drawback that is credited to the account within a week of export. “The remaining 2.5% is Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) that is given to us after we get the payment for the merchandise,” he said.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has cancelled the 2.5 per cent MEIS now. “It was initially cancelled with effect from January but has been extended till March, after which it will be permanently closed. But we are unable to apply for it from the beginning of this month,” he added.

National small match manufactures association secretary V S Sethu Rathinam said that despite escalating raw material prices, the maximum selling price of a matchbox has been maintained at one rupee for close to two decades. Some manufacturers have managed to maintain the price by reducing the number of buds in a box from 50 to 40 now. The industry had difficulty in pushing the excess production into markets pan India without a price hike and found export as a ray of hope. But reducing export incentive will affect manufacturers as well as exporters. Association president M Paramasivam said that exporters were dependent on this incentive as a means of profit.

“By quoting little more to make up the drop in incentive we will lose to competition from Indonesia and Pakistan that are exporting at a highly competitive rate,” he said. Indonesia is fast gaining ground, capturing our markets due to competitive pricing as they have easy access to wood locally. “We buy wood from Kerala or import it from Belgium,” he said. The associations have appealed to the government to extend the same 4% export incentive to them by increasing the drawback to 4% from the existing 1.5% . They also said that GST on 10 of the 14 raw materials used for making matchboxes is only 12 % but GST on matchboxes is 18 % which they hope will be reduced.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Erratic eating habits, sedentary lifestyle and increasing number of assisted reproductive procedures are pushing up cases of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), which has now become the top cause of maternal deaths in the state, surpassing post-partum haemorrhage (PPH).

As per latest records of the state health department, 313 maternal deaths were recorded in Telangana between April and October, 2019. PIH was found to be the leading cause of maternal deaths, 26%, during the period, while PPH caused 18% deaths and sepsis 14% of the 313 deaths. Anaemia, cardiac issues and hypertension caused a third of the deaths.

Explaining PIH, Dr Nabath Bandeli, gynaecologist and obstetrician, Mysha Clinics and Bloom Hospitals, said, “The blood pressure usually rises post-delivery and, if it crosses 160/ 110, it turns life threatening. PIH peaks in 48 hours and maximum occurrences (deaths) were seen within two weeks of delivery. PIH can cause multiple organ failure, fits (eclampsia) and tendencies to bleed.”

There are multiple reasons for increase in this phenomenon which are also linked with maternal deaths due to cardiac issues. Bad lifestyle and poor eating habits, family history and previous history of hypertension. “Another major factor contributing to increase in PIH is the fact that more and more couples resort to artificial reproductive techniques like IVF (in-vitro fertilisation) and IUI (intrauterine insemination). In assisted pregnancies, the placentation is a little different than the normal placenta. Also obesity, diabetes, multiple pregnancies, advanced maternal age and hectic work schedules contribute to increase in PIH,” Dr Prabha Agarwal, obstetrician and gynaecologist, Medicover Hospitals, told TOI.

Meanwhile, postpartum haemorrhage is on the decline say experts due to better facilities and infrastructure available at hospitals.

Bengaluru: The third-year BCom class is under way at Jain University, Jayanagar. The lecturer is moving around in a specific pattern, explaining a sum on computation of taxable long-term capital gain to students. While a front-bencher reads out the question, lecturer Rajdeep Manwani solves it, narrating the steps one by one. A visitor at the door finally gives away that he’s visually challenged.

Like Rajdeep, coordinator at the faculty of commerce in Jain University and popular quiz master and motivational speaker, there are several visually challenged lecturers in institutions across Bengaluru. Driven by their passion and an inspiration for students, they come up with innovative ways to overcome their disability and impart lessons.

“Necessity is the mother of invention, they say. I practise a lesson for over two hours before class. Both my students and I read from the same textbook. So I ensure that I give them something more than what’s there in the book. With over 25 years of practice, I can easily memorise even big numbers to help students with sums,” said Rajdeep. He takes students’ help to mark attendance, write down sums on the board and go to the staffroom.

Prof N Dasharath, head of department at University Law College, Bangalore University, said: “I memorise students’ names and their backgrounds, whether they are from Kannada or English medium, and their strengths and weaknesses. I try to make the class as participatory as possible. When it comes to evaluation, I take the help of a colleague who reads out the answers and I mark papers accordingly.” A professor for over 25 years, Dasharath suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, which has led to constant degeneration of his eyesight.

Kalyan C Kankanala, guest faculty at National Law School of India University’s (NLSIU) distance education programme, also employs a similar method. “My classes are normally interactive and discussion driven, and I get to assess student participation based on the nature and extent of their responses, comments, observations and arguments. Most concepts I teach are followed by example fact patterns, which require students to apply the concept they’ve learnt and respond. Based on how they respond to questions and fact patterns, I get to know how effective the class is,” explained Kalyan, who’s also a senior partner at an IP law firm, BananaIP Counsels.

While most of these teachers believe no other profession can touch as many lives as teaching, adding that it creates empathy and compassion among students, they feel more institutions need to open up to differently abled teachers.

Need for more inclusiveness

As of now, most premier institutions are circumspect about hiring persons with blindness. Things have changed compared to 10 years ago but there’s still a long way to go. Premier institutions like IIMs, IITs and National Law Schools don’t have too many persons with disabilities as teachers and their policies have to change a little before they are compliant with the Right of Persons with Disabilities Act. If one can creatively overcome the hurdles posed by her/his disability, teaching is a very good profession to choose. I believe inclusiveness can be improved with effective education and enforcement

224,['15/01/2020'],Not mandatory: Central Bank of India clarifies stance on NPR for KYC process,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Hyderabad: After asking its customers to submit a National Population Register (NPR) document as a proof for its Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure before January 31, the Central Bank of India has now said that NPR letter is not mandatory and that any other document is also valid for KYC .

In a clarification with regard to a recent advertisement in a Telugu daily on submission of NPR letter which caused disquiet among customers, the bank’s branch office in Rein Bazar, Hyderabad, said: “Any of the KYC documents can be given. Submission of NPR letter is not mandatory.” It said that NPR is just an additional document.

With customers questioning the rationale behind such a move, the bank, in response to a query from TOI, said : “As per RBI’s directives, not only the letter issued by the National Population Register, even other documents like passport, driving licence, Aadhaar number, voter identity card and NREGA job card are also officially valid documents (OVDs) for KYC purpose.”

Bankers pointed out that NPR letter had been one of the OVDs for KYC since 2017 when it was notified by the government under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. “All banks have been asking for it as one of the KYC documents,” they recall. The recent tension was over the Central Bank of India’s insistence to customers on submitting the NPR letter before January 31.

The bank is also said to have warned customers that they would not be able to withdraw or transfer money if they fail to do so. “Why is the bank asking for an NPR certificate when Aadhaar and PAN are sufficient for KYC?,” asked one Twitter user. Many claimed that the bank notice was being largely circulated on social media. The notice was also published in certain newspapers.

The notice also gave a toll-free number from which additional information could be sought or doubts clarified. When TOI contacted the toll-free number, the executives said there was no information about the NPR letter in their database. A senior bank official said that he was not aware of any such requirement.

Bengaluru: The annual avarekai (flat beans) mela, organised by a private store on VV Puram Food Street, has run into a controversy.

While BBMP claims it has not given permission for the event following objections from residents , the mela organisers held a press conference on Tuesday to announce that the fair will be held from January 17 for a week.

But BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar said it has not given permission for the mela so far. Local resident welfare associations and the VV Puram corporator are against the mela happening on Food Street. “They are concerned about an event being organised by a private store on the footpath and road which are public spaces. And there are issues of traffic chaos and hygiene,” he added.

Smitha Srinath, a resident of VV Puram, said, “The mela occupies the entire Food Street, not leaving any space for vehicles to move around. In case of an emergency, there will be little space even for an ambulance or a fire engine to enter the narrow road.” Residents alleged that the mela organisers draw electricity illegally from poles on the road and keep gas cylinders around , which could be dangerous.

Some residents said they were not against the mela but the venue has to be shifted to a space like National College Grounds or any other big space.

VV Puram corporator Vani V Rao said she won’t allow the mela to be held in the absence of BBMP’s permission. The organisers, however, announced on Tuesday that it will be held between January 17 and 23 from 10.30am to 11pm.

Asked about the controversy, Swathy KS, owner of Vasavi Condiments which organises the event, said they are in talks with the civic body and elected representatives. “If people are not cooperative, we will have no other option but to cancel the event. We will take a call soon,” she added.

Mayor Gautam Kumar said, “I wanted this to happen from day one as the event is also beneficial to farmers. I understand that managing traffic on the narrow road is not that easy, but if not for 10 days they should be given at least two days to host the mela.”

MARGAO: Some parts of Salcete and the whole of Mormugao will have restricted water supply on Wednesday as the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)-funded 100 MLD water treatment plant will be shut by the public works department (PWD) for urgent maintenance work of the 1,400mm main transmission line.

PWD assistant engineer Shrikant Gaonkar told TOI that the maintenance work entails installation of two zero velocity valves that will eliminate the creation of back pressure that often leads to breaches in the pipeline, disrupting water supply.

“Generation of back pressure in the pipeline is a common problem. We have had incidents of bursting of the pipeline recently, and in order to overcome the problem, we had proposed to install zero velocity in the pipeline. The plant will be shut for a day to install these valves,” Gaonkar said.

A zero velocity valve prevents a hammer effect in the piping system. It consists of a spring-loaded closing disc to stop reverse flow in case of failure of pumps.

While Mormugao and some parts of Salcete will receive restricted supply of water, the rest of South Goa will not be affected, it was informed.

TIRUPUR: Three people have been arrested for stealing more than 15,600kg copra from a copra drying unit in Kangeyam in the district.

The Kangeyam police arrested S Arunagirinathan, 62, of Chennimalai in Erode and his accomplices Prabhakaran, 29, of Musiri in Trichy and Hidros, 46, of Palakkad, on Sunday (January 12) based on a complaint lodged by S Tamil Selvan, manager of the copra drying unit.

According to a police officer, the unit at Kamatchipuram near Kangeyam was run by Karthikeyan, of Kinathukadavu in Coimbatore district. “He would buy coconut from farmers or traders and dry them in his unit to be sold to oil mills in Kangeyam and Kerala.”

On January 11, the unit got a call from a truck booking office saying that a truck was returning empty to Kerala and that the vehicle could be used to transport copra to that state. “Tamil Selvan agreed to send the goods in the truck,” the officer said.

Subsequently, the truck with three people, arrived at the unit the same day to take copra to an oil mill in Irinjalakuda in Thrissur district in Kerala. The truck was then loaded with 15,600kg copra. When Tamil Selvan asked the truck driver to provide vehicle registration certificate and driving licence, the latter said he had left them behind in some other place and promised to submit them before taking the truck.

But when Tamil Selvan went to attend nature’s call, the truck driver and his companions sped away in the truck. Following this, he lodged the complaint with the Kangeyam police, who registered a case and traced the truck to Kollengode in Palakkad, recovered the stolen copra and arrested the trio.

Hyderabad: Officials in the National Population Register (NPR) division said that there was no provision for a person to request NPR document. ““We prepare an NPR every 10 days based on the Census information... but do not make it available to individual citizens. There is no provision for citizens to ask for it or give it from our side,” a senior NPR official told TOI.

The NPR is prepared by the Registrar General and Census Commissioner (RGCC) which falls under the Union ministry of home affairs. According to the RGCC website, the data for NPR was collected in 2010 along with the house listing phase of Census of India, 2011. The updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting a door-to-door survey.

“Now, it has been decided to update NPR along with house listing phase of Census 2021 between April and September this year in all the states/Union territories except Assam,” the website says. The objective of NPR is to create a comprehensive database of every resident. “We will be taking up work pertaining to updating NPR this year and next. But, this information will not be given to individuals,” an official said.

Hyderabad: Anticipating trouble in the wake of municipal elections, police in Bhainsa had started binding over of people with criminal antecedents since the first week of January. One of the persons bound over is the town president of a religious organisation.

In the past one week prior to the communal clashes, nearly all FIRs registered by Bhainsa police were bind over cases. Between January 6 and January 12, police had booked 13 cases under Section-107 of CrPC against people of both religious communities and bound them over to prevent them from causing any disturbance during upcoming municipal polls.

So far this year, police of Bhainsa town bound over 51 people from different communities. “The bind over process was started in view of upcoming municipal elections and those who have criminal antecedents especially history of election related cases, have been booked,” Bhainsa sub-inspector Balakrishna said.

After registering an FIR, the accused will be produced before the concerned RDO for bind over process and if the accused resort to any illegal activity during bind over period, they will have to pay a pre-specified amount to the government.

On January 2, Bhainsa police had booked a case under IPC sections 188 and 290 against seven members of a religious organisation, including one who is an accused in recent violence, for taking out a rally from a worship place to MRO office in support of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in violation of police orders.

“The violence was not pre-planned. As soon as police came to know about initial confrontation between two groups, they rushed there and pacified both the parties to leave the place,” IG Y Nagi Reddy said.

BENGALURU: Thousands of employees of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) were enamoured of managing director C Shikha on Tuesday, after a video of her test-driving a Volvo bus went viral. She’s the first IAS officer in recent times to have inspected a bus by getting behind the wheel.A visibly confident Shikha, accompanied by senior officials of the corporation, drove the vehicle on the test track at the Hoskote training centre on Saturday. Her driving skills not only got an overwhelming response from the utility’s male-dominated workforce but also brought a smile to Prema Ramappa Nadapatti, its lone woman driver. BMTC, with a daily ridership of 36 lakh, has 6,400 buses and employs around 14,000 drivers.On the job for more than a decade, Prema says bus drivers face several challenges, including traffic congestion and rash riding by two-wheelers. She drives on the Kempegowda Bus Station-Begur route.Shikha, a 2004 IAS officer, took charge as BMTC MD in September 2019. Her test drive came after a series of brake failures which led to accidents. Though a few netizens took potshots at her by seeking to know if she possessed a license, many were impressed with her for daring to test vehicles before making any purchases. Shikha was not available for comments.A BMTC spokesperson in a statement said: “The vehicle was driven at the bus training centre... in a controlled environment. No harm was caused to the public,” adding that Shikha has a learner’s licence for heavy vehicles. At Volvo’s manufacturing unit in Hoskote, a test driving track is provided for customers to test drive and experience its buses under the supervision of a qualified driver.Meanwhile, BMTC ’s 33% reservation plan for women drivers has remained a non-starter for long. Of the total licence-holders in the state, women comprise only 15%. BMTC has earmarked around Rs 7.5 crore to train 1,000 women in driving buses and light motor vehicles free of cost under the Nirbhaya fund . This will also help women explore employment opportunities with app-based taxi firms and schools.Those who have held LMV (light motor vehicle) licence for a year can apply for HPV (heavy passenger vehicle) licence to drive buses. While LMV applicants are being trained on city roads, HPV applicants are trained at the centre in Vaddarahalli on Magadi Road.Will inspire other women“Our MD (Shikha) is an inspiration and a role model for others. I have never seen a woman officer driving a bus. It is not easy but she was focused and drove without fear. This also shows she’s passionate about the buses and understands the problems faced by drivers.

Apartment bodies get notice

BENGALURU: When 18-year-old Ikram (name changed) and his two friends stepped out of their flat in SG Palya, east Bengaluru, for tea past midnight on Monday, little did they know that they’d be in the soup.While Ikram and his two friends left the flat at 1am for tea at a nearby stall, the teen’s elder brother, Saif (name changed) and two others stayed back as they were getting ready to hit the sack. All six are students of various city colleges and hail from Kerala .Within a few minutes, Saif heard commotion downstairs and looked out of the balcony to see Ikram calling for help. Ikram and his friends had been stopped by two patrol police, who wanted to know what they were doing on the road so late and where they lived. Saif, 21, approached the policemen, wanting to know what the issue was. The cops asked them for their names and ID cards. On learning that Saif was a Muslim, one of them asked him if he was a Pakistani.Though Saif was taken aback, he again asked what the problem was. The cops then asked the youngsters to give them their mobile phones. “Even as Ikram’s friend showed them his phone, the cops tried to snatch it. At that moment, I asked them if they have a warrant to check our personal belongings. My question appeared to tick off a cop, who immediately turned to me and said that if I needed a warrant, I should come to the police station,” said Saif, adding that they kept asking if they were Pakistanis. The youth said cops also told them that they had arrested a few terrorists recently. “I was perplexed as to why they needed to tell us all that,” he added.One of Saif’s friends, meanwhile, began filming the incident on his phone and a policeman asked him to stop. A video clip shared with TOI shows the cop angrily asking the student to stop filming, while the person shooting the video is heard, saying: “Sir, it is a public place. I can record.”Within minutes, the policeman called for four more cops – two in Hoysala and two in patrol bikes. The quartet turned up with lathis and forced Saif and two of his friends into the patrol car. Around 1.30am, they were taken to SG Palya police station.According to Saif, the cops initially spoke to them nicely. “But within seconds, the scene changed, and a policeman came into the room with a lathi. I thought it was just to scare us, but then he began hitting us,” Saif recalled. “Three cops took turns to beat us until my local guardian came to the police station at 3.30am,” he added.The three youths took blows on their hands, back and legs. Before releasing them, the cops made them give an undertaking declaring they won’t step out late at night and slapped petty cases against them (causing nuisance) and a fine of Rs 500 per person. “The document read that we will not step out late at night and if cops found us, any action could be taken against us. They also made us sign another document in Kannada , which they said is signed by persons riding without a helmet,” Saif explained.The youngsters said the men in uniform also threatened to get them evicted from the apartment and even get their internships cancelled. Saif said stepping out for tea after midnight is normal among students and young professionals living in the area, but such unwarranted police action is new.With the incident going viral on Instagram, DCP (Whitefield) MN Anucheth, who is in charge of south-east division, ordered an inquiry into the case. “I learnt about the incident through social media. I have ordered the assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Mico Layout to conduct an investigation and submit a report,” said Anucheth.Close on the heels of the arrest of terror suspects in Bengaluru and elsewhere in Karnataka , police issued notices to apartment associations to reveal details of occupants.The notice, a copy of which is available with TOI, seeks details of occupants at apartments. It states that if the association finds anyone suspicious, they need to immediately inform cops.Police sources said: “At many apartments, flat owners have either rented or leased out their premises. But in several cases, tenant details have not been collected and this could be a security threat. We are asking residents to be alert to anything suspicious in their neighbourhood.”According to them, many apartments are seeking contact numbers, photos and email IDs, not just of occupants, but also of visitors.In Video: Bengaluru cops ask Kerala youths are you from Pakistan",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73263951,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-80399,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cops-ask-youths-out-for-tea-if-theyre-from-pak-drag-3-to-station/articleshow/73257830.cms
233,['15/01/2020'],Govt’s reluctance to bear treatment cost rattles rare disease patients’ kin,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Bengaluru: Support groups of patients with rare diseases are upset with the draft national policy on rare diseases. They say it’s vague about financial responsibility of treatment in such cases.

Stating the government has failed in taking ownership of treatment cost of patients, they say the draft policy is more like an information bulletin on rare diseases. It also does not put a timeframe on its implementation.

The draft was released on January 13, inviting objections, if any, from the public. The government first came out with the policy in 2017 and withdrew it abruptly in 2018, claiming it wants to improvise it.

“There are certain positives in the draft policy like newborn screening and high-risk pregnancy test. But it puts a cap of Rs 15 lakh for treatment of rare diseases. For many patients with rare diseases, where bone marrow transplant is the only solution, the procedure itself costs Rs 30 lakh. For many with lysosomal storage disorders, the treatment costs per annum runs into several crores of rupees. The draft policy hardly gives hope to such patients,” said Prasanna Shirol, founder, Organization For Rare Diseases India.

Prasanna’s daughter Nidhi Shirol who is suffering from Pompe, a rare disease, has been on ventilator for more than two years now. Pompe is a lysosomal storage disorder, which is a rare inherited neuromuscular disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness.

Vineeth Dev, 9, suffers from Hunter syndrome, a type of mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) which is a metabolic disorder caused by the absence of a lysosomal enzyme that is needed to break down complex molecules in the body. Patients with this rare disorder suffer from abnormalities in many organs, including heart, respiratory system, affecting the neurological development too.

“For children born with MPS, the minimum cost of drugs is more than Rs 2.5 crore per annum. In my son’s case, for the last two years, we have been getting drugs free from the drug manufacturing company. The drugs come directly to Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health (IGICH ), where they are administered to my son. We have not got any drugs from the government. The draft policy makes no mention of the financial support, instead speaks about crowdfunding. Rare diseases like MPS have no one-time solution and those who may donate on crowdfunding platforms don’t keep on donating,” said Vidya CA, Vineeth’s mother.

Vidya says her child’s treatment would have been completely taken care of by the government had he been born in the US.

Parents of several patients are aghast that the draft policy does not mention insurance policies for rare diseases, already a grey area.

Ten-year-old Deeksha Sampath’s parents spent over Rs 25,000-30,000 per month for medicines for her Spinal muscular atrophy, a genetic disease affecting the nervous system in the body and muscle movement. “How do we depend on the government’s crowdfunding move? It hardly gives hopes,” said Deeksha’s mother Rashmi Sampanth.

However, Dr KS Sanjay, director, Indira Gandhi Institute of Rare Diseases, says the draft policy is the first step and certainly a big move. “In India there has been no epidemiological survey on rare diseases. Globally, there are close to 5,000 diseases considered rare. In India, there are over 450 rare diseases. Currently, in India, research updates aren’t conclusive of diagnosis, gene analysis. There is much to do in terms of research. The draft policy is a preliminary step and it will be improved gradually,” he added.

Currently, 29 paediatric patients with rare diseases are seeking medicines at IGICH through state government funds.

Hyderabad: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi said if the National Register of Citizenship (NRC) is implemented, Adivasis and Dalits would also face the brunt along with Muslims. “When the Citizenship Amendment Bill was introduced in Parliament, I considered it as black law and tore a copy of the bill...It’s unacceptable,” Owaisi said late on Monday.

The Hyderabad MP urged people to view the National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) seriously. “If NPR happens then NRC will also be implemented. They are twins, so if one of them begins the other will too. While its not mandatory that these should be together, they want to implement both,” he added.

Campaigning for AMIM candidates in Medak district for the civic polls, Owaisi targeted the RSS for describing the Indian flag as “inauspicious”. “Let BJP answer. Isn’t it a fact that when the tricolor was declared as the national flag, the RSS organiser had written the flag was inauspicious? If they dare to refute this, I will show them evidence,” Owaisi said at a meeting.

Panaji: Some residents of Porvorim on Tuesday asked chief minister Pramod Sawant to reduce the six-lane flyover from Pundalik Nagar to Socorro junction to a four-lane corridor on NH-66. The CM said that he would look into this demand.

The delegation comprised waste management minister Michael Lobo, Socorro sarpanch Sandeep Vazarkar and others. Lobo said residents of Porvroim have demanded that the flyover should be reduced to four lanes from six lanes.

Porvorim resident Ravi Chodankar said that the new proposed flyover bridge touches many balconies and houses. He also said that the corridor would be built over two pillars on either side of the road. “This is not viable for anybody,” he said.

Chodankar said that health is going to be a huge problem for children in the locality due to vehicular pollution.

“We want the corridor, the flyover bridge, but it should be four-lane bridge as it touches the Atal Setu, a four-lane bridge,” Chodankar said. “The plan is to build a six-lane bridge. For what, we have no idea.” He added that the width of the bridge should be 20m.

Chodankar also said the bridge should at least be 7m tall so that gases generated by vehicles go horizontally and don’t affect the children and people of Porvorim. He also said the new flyover would be detrimental to the houses of Porvorim, many of which are a hundred years old. Chodankar said Porvorim should be considered a virgin area where health is concerned. “People have lived here for years, and suddenly taking decisions is not correct,” he said.

HYDERABAD: A five-year-old male leopard was left critically injured after getting trapped in a snare laid for wild boars by unidentified persons in Agilapuram thanda of Nalgonda district on Tuesday. The leopard, which was rescued by a team of veterinary officials, has been kept under observation for 48 hours at the Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad.

“There are a few serious internal injuries because it got caught in the snare and tried to fight it and escape for almost two hours. There are also external injuries on the neck, shoulder and hind leg. It is unable to bear weight on hind legs,” said a zoo source. “Treatment is being done but (the leopard) is still scared and has not eaten anything yet,” the source added.

However, a statement by zoo officials stated that the medical condition of the leopard was static. “The zoo rescue team led by Dr Asadullah, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon rushed to the spot after receiving information from the Nalgonda Forest Divisional Officer (FDO) and rescued the panther safely by chemical immobilization. The leopard is currently under medical care and supervision of veterinarians at the Nehru Zoological Park, condition of panther is static,” the statement said.

The incident came to light on Tuesday morning after farmers noticed that instead of wild boars, a leopard was trapped in the metal snare. They then alerted the police, who in turn informed in the Forest department officials.

BENGALURU: A pilot working with IndiGo Airlines has been grounded for misbehaving with a 75-year-old passenger and her daughter on board flight 6E 806 from Chennai to Bengaluru on Monday.

According to the younger woman, who narrated her ordeal on social media on Tuesday, the pilot ‘harassed and threatened’ her and her mother for requesting wheelchair assistance upon landing at Kempegowda International Airport , Bengaluru.

Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri responded to the passenger on Twitter , assuring a full inquiry into the matter.

The passenger, Supriya Unni Nair, on Tuesday tweeted that the pilot ‘yelled’ at her and her mother and threatened to prevent them from disembarking. The pilot also threatened Supriya and her mother with jail time, she said, in a series of tweets.

“I requested my office to contact @Indigo6E as soon as I saw the tweet by Ms SupriyaUnniNair about the pilot’s behavior with her and her 75-yr old-mother. The has informd @MoCA_GoI that the pilot has been off-rostered pending full inquiry,” the minister tweeted in response to the complaint.

Supriya said she put out her experience on social media because what she and her mother went through was very traumatic. “Regardless of age, one must never be treated in this manner. This was the first time I was treated like this on a flight,” Supriya told TOI.

In her tweets, Supriya said: “@IndiGo6E Your captain on 6E 806 from Chennai to Bangalore on January 13 Jayakrishna harassed, threatened and prevented me and my 75-year old diabetic mom from disembarking the flight and threatened to arrest us because we asked for wheelchair assistance. I always ask for wheelchair beforehand for my mom & remind staff when we land. Staff on all airlines have always been helpful. Our flight was late & when we landed at 9:15 I tried calling the assistance bell & when the crew didn’t respond I walked up for help. She claimed we don’t have access to a wheelchair when it was clearly printed on the ticket. When I pointed this out to her, the captain came barging out and yelled at me for pressing the assistance button and annoying him and his crew. How dare you call her Veena he asks. (FYI her name tag says Veena) Taken aback, I tell him not to yell at me and then the threats start. The wheelchair guys arrive and he points at mom and says you’re not going anywhere (sic).”

Continuing with her tweet, Supriya said the pilot prevented the wheelchair assistants from taking her mother out of the aircraft and threatened them that he’d ensure they are detained and spend a night in jail.

Supriya said her mother got worried as the pilot was so aggressive that he looked like he’d get physically abusive with her. She asked the pilot not to be rude like that, to which he retorted he is the captain, his job is to fly the plane and not be polite to mere passengers. “You have paid piddly Rs 2000, you don’t own the aircraft ... I will make sure you are barred from the skies” Supriya tweeted him as saying.

“Captain’s parting shot was another threat that there will be an FIR filed against me and my mom… NONE of the other crew onboard 6E 806 intervened or helped us on the plane,” Supriya said.

Police maintained strict vigil to prevent untoward incidents

HYDERABAD: Two days after the communal clash, Bhainsa continued to remain under strict police vigil. Around 1,000 police personnel, including two companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF), have been deployed in the Korva Galli and surrounding areas where the clashes took place. So far, 59 persons have been arrested in the six cases registered pertaining to the clashes.

Apart from one incident wherein a parked auto was set ablaze, the law and order remained peaceful on Tuesday. “Prohibitory orders are in place with imposition of section 144 of CrPC. We are not allowing any outsiders, including political leaders, to enter the communally sensitive areas,” inspector general (IG) Y Nagi Reddy said.

Police did not allow Adilabad MP Soyam Bapu Rao to visit the localities where clashes took place. The MP held a meeting with the IG and left the town. “Miscreants burnt the building belonging to one of the religious organisations. The family lodged a complaint and a case was registered. Police asked me not to go to the affected areas as it might lead to trouble,” the MP told TOI. In Hyderabad, police prevented lone-BJP MLA Raja Singh from going to Bhainsa and meeting a section of the violence-affected families on Tuesday. “I have been house arrested while I was leaving to Bhainsa,” Singh tweeted.

Of the six cases registered, one pertained to the damaging of property at a place of worship. Two cases have been registered, based on complaints of an inspector and constable, against rioters from both communities. A case of attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy and arson was registered on the basis of a complaint of a religious organisation’s head who alleged that his house was burnt.Another case was registered based on the complaint of a businessman who alleged that his car and two-wheeler were burnt. Police have also registered a case of assault following a complaint by a 65-year-old who sustained bleeding injuries as a result of the clash.

“So far, we have arrested 59 people in six cases. A total of 14 houses, 24 motorcycles, one car and two autos were damaged in violence. The number of cases might increase if more victims whose houses were burnt lodge separate complaints,” the IG said.

239,['15/01/2020'],90% of rural kids aged 4-8 are now going to school,"This story is from January 15, 2020

NEW DELHI: The latest Annual Status of Education Report (Rural) ( ASER 2019) released on Tuesday shows that 90% of children in the age group of 4-8 years are enrolled in some type of educational institution with the figure standing at 99.5% for the 8-year-olds.

Overall, more girls are going to school, but there are more boys in private schools than girls. While the ability at tasks improves substantially in the age group of 4 to 5, a large proportion of 5-year-olds are unable to perform expected tasks with ease, with children from less advantaged homes affected disproportionately.

The survey found that older students do better in terms of performance on cognitive, early language, early numeracy , and social and emotional learning. While 50% of the children whose mothers have eight years or less schooling ended up in anganwadis or government schools, mothers who studied beyond elementary stages are more likely to enrol their wards in private schools.

Every year, since 2005, ASER has reported on the schooling status and the ability of students at basic reading and arithmetic tasks for children in the 5-16 age group in rural India.

After 10 years on this job, ASER switched to an alternate-year cycle in 2016, where basic ASER is conducted every other year (2016, 2018, and next in 2020). In the intervening years, ASER focuses on a different aspect of children’s schooling and learning.

In 2019, ASER puts the spotlight on the early years, reporting on the schooling status, as well as on a range of important developmental indicators for young children in the age group of 4-8 years.

Conducted in 26 districts across 24 states in India, the survey covered 1,514 villages, 30,425 households, and 36,930 children in the age group of 4-8 years.

National policy recommends that children in the 4- to 5-year age bracket should be in pre-primary classes. At this stage, children should be encouraged to develop a range of abilities and skills, including cognitive, social, and emotional skills as well as the conceptual foundations needed for formal schooling.

240,['15/01/2020'],Education survey shows students in district struggle with numbers,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Nagpur: Students aged between four to eight years are struggling with numbers (basic math problems) in Nagpur district, says a survey by NGO Pratham, published in its Annual Status of Education Report (Aser). This year Aser survey’s theme was ‘Early Years’, and they chose just one district in each state (except Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh), for their sample survey. Nagpur district was chosen in Maharashtra and the report states that only 4.8% students of Std I are able to do two-digit numeric addition.

Even in Std III, only 32.3% students were able to do numeric subtraction of two digits, whereas 46.4% were able to do two-digit numeric addition. Std II students fared worse, with only 17.8% being able to do two-digit numeric addition whereas only 9.9% were able to do two-digit numeric subtraction. For Std I students, the results were extremely poor as just 2% were able to do two-digit numeric subtraction whereas only 4.8% were able to add.

Statistics improved drastically when single-digit addition and subtraction problems were given to kids. For Std III, 78.1% students were able to do numeric subtraction whereas 88.4% were able to add. Std II students found things difficult with just 55.2% being able to do subtraction and 65.4% able to do addition.

Purshottam Panchbhai, office bearer of Mathematics Teachers Association (Nagpur), said, “The survey size sometimes skews the data drastically and is not truly representative of the larger ground reality. Regardless, math is something which children do find tough because probably they have not been taught in the correct way. Teaching has to be made more student-friendly with authorities adopting out-of-the box teaching techniques.”

Aser 2019 also surveyed ‘emotional’ aspect of children by asking them to identify emotions based on pictures shown to them. Four emotions; happy, sad, angry and afraid, were displayed through placards and students asked to relate to it. Children aged four identified the most with happy emotion, with 72.4% being able to recognize what feeling the picture in front of them generated.

For the remaining three emotions, only 40% odd kids were able to relate. At the upper end of the age group, eight-year-old students too were quickly able to recognize ‘happy’ with 88.6% responding correctly. But in contrast to the younger students, these eight-year-olds were also better at identifying the other three emotions, with a strike rate of anywhere between 60% to 75%.

The patient, Kesavan R from Sivagangai was admitted at GRH with symptoms of stridor and breathing difficulty which indicated stenosis or narrowing of the trachea or windpipe. “After being diagnosed through a 3D CT Scan, a tracheal resection of 3 cm length and subsequent anastomosis was done for the patient. It was a rare and delicate reconstructive procedure which was successfully completed. The patient was vulnerable because of the previous prolonged intubation,” said doctors.

With no complications post the surgery, Kesavan is expected to make complete recovery. tnn

243,['15/01/2020'],"Except Calangute, no beach implements no-drinking law","This story is from January 15, 2020

Panaji: Six months after its introduction, the law penalising people for drinking on beaches and other public places is yet to be implemented. Except for Calangute, no other beach in the state has implemented the amended legislation—Registration of Tourist Trade Act.

Tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar on Tuesday held a meeting to discuss tourism related issues. The department is also yet to install signboards on beaches warning visitors that drinking is not allowed, and violators will be made to pay a penalty. “It has been decided to meet the DIG to find out why police have not been implementing the provisions of the Tourist Trade Act,” said an official who was part of the two-hour meeting. He added that it was felt police have not shown much interest in penalising people drinking on beaches.

Minister for science and technology Michael Lobo, who is also the Calangute MLA, said that since the amended provision of the act came into force, Calangute police registered 63 offences and penalised people. “If Calangute police can do it, why can’t other police stations,” said Lobo after the meeting. Calangute is the only panchayat so far to have installed signboards that drinking is not permitted and the offence will attract a penalty.

Persons held guilty of drinking on a beach attract a fine of Rs 2,000. A similar penalty is to be imposed on persons caught cooking in public spaces.

Lobo said it is only in his constituency that the amended Registration of Tourist Trade Act is being implement because he has been continuously pursuing the matter with the Calangute PI. If the existing rules are implemented in to-to, Lobo said Goa would not require to do anything more to keep nuisance tourists at bay. “Once they are penalised for drinking on a beach or cooking in the open and littering, they will either behave themselves or stop coming,” he said.

The legislation was amended after continued lobbying by tourism stakeholders who highlighted how drinking on beaches was manifesting into a big problem and needed to be stopped.

Salem/Erode: Street hawkers selling Pongal festival items were a common sight in Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri and Erode districts on Tuesday. More than 10,000 of them had surfaced in the region to sell sugarcane, turmeric plants, pots, fruits, banana and flowers.

M Athikesavan, a street hawker in Erode city, said, “It’s the 12th year that I am setting up this roadside shop on Bazaar Street to sell sugarcane and turmeric. I usually earn nearly Rs 10,000 in a single day.” He would wind up the business only on Wednesday afternoon.

According to him, during the festival, many sugarcane and turmeric farmers in the district come forward to sell their produce by themselves. “They will realize a good profit as therte won’t be any middlemen.”

The prices of the festival essentials have also, meanwhile, gone up. A pair of sugarcane, which was sold at Rs 40 on Monday night, was priced at Rs 50 on Tuesday morning. “The price touched Rs 80 in the evening and it will cross the Rs 100 mark on Wednesday morning,” said A Usharani, one of the sugarcane sellers in Salem city.

Representative image

JAIPUR: Though dates for municipal elections have not been announced, political parties have already chalked out strategies to woo voters.

BJP has planned for a door-to-door campaign to spread awareness on Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) from January 15 to 20 with a focus on minority communities.

The saffron party’s move to woo the minority communities comes on the backdrop of intense protest against CAA and NRC all over the country.

According to Jaipur BJP committee, the party will target at least 10 minority families in every booth. There are around 1,800 booths in the city which will make it a huge number for BJP in the elections.

Sunil Kothari, head of BJP (Jaipur city) said that the elections will be held soon in Jaipur which makes it necessary for the party to make people aware about the basis of the CAA.

“We have to start preparing now and clear doubts of the minority community regarding the CAA. Minorities are scared of CAA but it is actually in their benefit and we will work hard to make them understand that,” said Kothari.

Protests against CAA and NRC have been going on for a long time in the nation. Rajasthan Congress party is claiming that the BJP is trying to divert the mind of the people from the real issues.

Congress leader Archana Sharma said, “Economy is going down and unemployment is rising in the country. This is a crisis situation for the country and BJP is focused on the CAA. This is a method to divide people as they have no other option in fighting elections.”

She said that Congress party stands with the people of the country and will fight for the rights of the youth. Some councillors of the Congress party said that municipal elections should be fought on the local issues and not on national issues.

<p>A file photo of last year’s One Billion Rising <br></p>

KOLKATA: The widespread protests against CAA and NRC has also touched One Billion Rising (OBR).

Organised by Mary Ward Social Centre, an initiative of the Loreto order, housed on the premises of Loreto Entally, the annual programme to celebrate womanhood will give a clarion call to bridge all inequalities and urge people to stand by the minorities in their “hour of need”. The sixth edition of the programme in the city will be held at Allen Park , in association with the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, on January 31. The event will be in keeping with this year’s theme, Rise, Unite, Resist. “Hatred and exclusion has become the order of the day, dotted with lingering insecurity of the minorities,” reads the national pledge.

One Billion Rising (OBR) is a global movement started by women’s rights activist Eve Ensler in 2012 in response to the UN data that stated that one billion girls/women across the world faced or lived with threat of violence. In India, OBR is headquartered in Delhi. The partners in different cities organise programmes, themed on topics adopted for the year. “OBR is a celebration of womanhood, we sing paeans to the feminine spirit, which is indomitable. This year, however, we cannot limit our protest to just the cause of women because the atmosphere of the country is charged with insecurity... we are at one with the national resolution of OBR,” said Loreto nun Monica Suchiang, director of the Mary Ward Social centre. The national resolution doesn’t mince words when it says, “We stand amidst a rising tide of nationalism, staggering economic crisis, attacks on academic autonomy, violation of basic human rights and a repressive regime. Citizens who were ensured a right to vote are being de-legitimised as non-citizens and are on the verge of being expelled from the country. We call for a collective rising…”

Though the theme changes every year, the focus remains on violence against women, with renowned singers, schools and the who’s who in the city participating to show solidarity with the cause. Given the nationwide movement against the new citizenship law and NRC, the organisers will hold a panel discussion, “Addressing the inequality chain”, where the speakers will include social entrepreneur and arts curator Nandita Pal Chaudhuri, model Nick Rampal, gender rights activist Saira Halim, social activists Madiha Ahmed and Deep Purakayastha and writer Anchita Ghatak. The discussion will be moderated by Anglo Indian MLA Shane Calvert.

Calvert, who has been vocal not only against CAA and NRC but also against the de-reservation of Anglo Indian seats in the Parliament and state legislative assemblies, felt OBR will rightly reflect minority insecurities. “We have to resist, rise and speak in one voice against different forms of injustices and inequalities that are being meted out to us. Hope, we are able to create a change-making dialogue,” he said.

MHTR will be first tiger reserve in the state for which an ESZ will be declared

JAIPUR: The ministry of environment and climate change has issued a draft notification to declare a 1km eco-sensitive zone around Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR) spread over 759.99 sq-km covering the four districts of Kota, Bundi, Chittorgarh and Jhalawar.

The ministry, which had issued the notification on January 10, has sought suggestions and objections within 60 days.

This is the first tiger reserve in the state for which an ESZ will be declared. The MHTR, established in 2013, encompasses areas of Mukundara Hills National Park, Dara Sanctuary, Jawahar Sagar Sanctuary and part of National Chambal Ghariyal Sanctuary (From Garadia Mahadev to Jawahar Sagar Dam) which constitutes its core area.

A senior forest official said the eco-sensitive zones will be treated as a ‘breathing space’ for wildlife. It is demarcated based on their ecological importance which reigns in development activities inimical to wildlife and their habitats.

While the zone will be completely compatible to livelihoods of local communities living around the tiger reserve, it will bring the order on tourism, mining activities, industries and other footloose development activities disrupting wildlife corridors outside reserve boundary.

“The ESZ is a critical tool for wildlife conservation and MHTR is in the process to declare it soon,” said an official

The reserve is not only rich in scenic beauty and biodiversity, but also has at least two probable corridors from Ranthambhore– one through Indergarh - Lakheri - Ramgarh Vishdhari Sanctuary-Dabi – Jawahar Sagar Sanctuary and the other through the ravines of Chambal and Kalisindh to Dara. The draft reads, “Special efforts are required to conserve this rich natural heritage, to provide safe passage/corridor to the tigers of adjacent Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve and to reintroduce tigers in the area. Hence it has been given special legal protection as is available under Section 38(V) of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 by constituting it as a tiger reserve.”

A draft notification of the environment ministry also mentions that the government shall also constitute a state-level eco-sensitive zone monitoring committee (SESZMC) to monitor the compliance of the ESZ notification.

An offical source said, “No fresh mining lease shall be granted in the eco-sensitive zone and the existing mining leases, if any, shall be phased out in five years or with the term of current lease renewal, whichever is earlier.”

The women at Park Circus Maidan with the supply of sanitary napkins and biscuits

KOLKATA: The protesters at Park Circus Maidan, who have been braving the cold to stage a sit-in demonstration against the CAA and NRC, have received “gifts” from three students to see them through the trying times.

Md Masoom Rana Dewan, Debkanya Halder and their friend distributed sanitary napkins, bottled water and a bag full of biscuits to the women who have been stationed at the maidan for the past one week without even basic amenities, like washroom, running water and shelter from the biting cold. The three have also urged citizens to support the movement by donating shawls, bed sheets, bottled water and packaged food, rudimentary everyday items that the protesters need.

On her earlier visit to what is now being called Kolkata’s Shaheen Bagh , Debkanya noticed the hardship the women had been facing. “Hundreds of women, children and infants are sitting here and protesting for the past one week without basic amenities. We thought of getting them sanitary napkins as there are women of all ages at the venue. We also got them water and biscuits,” said the research scholar, adding that this was the least they could do for the women, who were fighting a battle for everyone. Referring to the distribution of sanitary napkins, Nousheen Baba Khan, a research scholar and a participant, said, “This act has shattered taboos about menstruation.”

Farhat Islam, a homemaker who has been at Park Circus since last Tuesday said, “These small gestures motivate us to carry on this protest.” Asmat Jamil, an NGO activist, said, “It shows how concerned the young generation is. They think about the problems women here might face. I am thankful to everyone who is supporting this movement, without any political banner.”

For Masoom, it is their duty, as a sensitive human being, to stand by those protesting at this hour of crisis. He is using social media to mobilise people so that more women can join the demonstration. He has also urged citizens that on their next visit ti the protest venue, they could get shawls, bed sheets, packaged food, bottled-water and sanitary napkins.

The sit-in, which started last Tuesday with a group of burqa-clad women and students from different campuses, has witnessed a steady rise in the number of participants, with more and more people joining in every day. Debkanya and Masoom’s friend, who studies abroad, has come home for a holiday. He is overwhelmed to see hundreds of women, along with their kids, spending nights in the open, shouting slogans ‘Azaadi’, ‘Halla Bol’, ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ to protest against the discriminatory law.

“Privileged people like us walk rallies and then return to the comfort of our homes. But what these people are doing is heartening and powerful. It can be called a true people’s movement,” said the youngster. He added that the movement could not be limited to only rallies and meetings. “The presence of more people will strengthen the movement and will help send out a message of inclusiveness,” he said.

Akram said his kites are home-made and designed for the special occasion of Makar Sankranti. “I have made three 8-feet-long and 5.5-feet-wide kites. These require normal materials as used in any other kites, but the quantity is more. It costs between Rs 1,200 and Rs 1,500 per kite. Last year I made a 12-feet-long kite. Have to be cautious though, people are always eyeing to cut this kite,” he said.

KOLKATA: A caller introduces himself or herself as a representative from an online sales platform and offers hefty discounts, prizes to and special access to products to a ‘lucky winner’ way before the big discount sales begin. The customer takes the bait and before s/he realizes, she is left poorer by several thousand rupees. Sounds familiar? Online scams are back this year with the same modus operandi.In the latest incident, for which an FIR was registered on Monday, Hindustan Park resident Chandra Chur Banik claimed to have lost Rs 46,500 to fraudsters. He received a text message from an unknown number. Identifying themselves as e-commerce company employees, the sender stated that Banik had won Rs 12,80,000 in a lucky draw. “Accordingly they induced the complainant to deposit a processing fee of Rs 46,500, thus cheating him of the amount,” a Gariahat cop said.Kolkata police have cited a communication from an e-commerce site to advise consumers to be wary of frauds in the upcoming discount season around Republic Day. Now, almost a yearly phenomenon beyond the festive months, four incidents of online frauds offering prizes to ‘lucky draw winners’ in south Kolkata has led cops to act.“Several teams from the cybercrime cell are already probing the multiple e-wallet frauds that took place in the city under the garb of KYC verification.

Cops said that they would forward their recommendations to the firms, detailing how the employee of an e-commerce platform managed to steal and then sell confidential data of customers to a gang of cheats.Cops have established that customer data — including their contact details and buying preferences — is being sold at the throwaway price of Rs 10 per person. “We found that a few former employees of such companies are selling crucial customer data to the gang members.

Puducherry: Government whip R K R Anantharaman accused Congress MLA N Danavelu , who levelled corruption charges against chief minister V Narayanasamy, his son and health minister Malladi Krishna Rao, of acting as an agent of the BJP party and attempting to topple the Congress government in the Union territory.

Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Anantharaman charged that Danavelu has been making attempts to overthrow the Congress government and form a government headed by the former chief minister and All India NR Congress founder-leader N Rangasamy.

He alleged that Danavelu with the support of AIADMK MLAs attempted to broker a deal with an independent MLA from Mahe for the change in government. He said the Congress MLA has not been in the fold of the party and not been participating in the party affairs for the past two years.

“He (Danavelu) failed to work for the party’s candidate in the recently-held Lok Sabha polls. He has launched efforts to create a mirage that the Congress government failed to implement people welfare schemes,” Anantharaman said. He strongly condemned Danavelu’s remarks that chief minister has become ‘unfit to govern the Union territory’ and has occupied the post ‘through the back door’.

“Danavelu has levelled false charges of corruption against the chief minister and others. In fact, he was the third elected member to sign after Narayanasamy was unanimously elected as the Congress legislative party leader and was set to occupy the top post,” the government whip said. Anantharaman challenged the Congress MLA to prove the charges of corruption against the chief minister and others.

Condemning Danavelu for attempting to tarnish the image of the Congress government, Anantharaman said a CBI probe into activities of the Puducherry Agro Products, Food and Civil Supplies Corporation (Papsco) managed by chairman Danavelu will expose his corrupt practices.

Anantharaman pointed out that the Congress government allotted Rs 50 crore of a Rs 100-crore centrally sponsored project to the Bahour assembly segment represented by Danavelu to refute the charges levelled by the MLA that his constituency has been ignored by the government.

Moreover, the government has earmarked Rs 1.5 crore to construct an indoor stadium at Bahour constituency and the construction work has begun, he said.

Anantharaman while refuting MLA’s charges maintained that the health directorate has ensured adequate stock of life-saving drugs at the government hospitals and centres in the territory.

“The MLA does not have the political maturity. He is carried away by his emotions. It is high time that he changes his attitude and approach lest the party high command will take appropriate action against him,” Anantharaman said.

Hyderabad: Cases of credit card fraud are fast rising in the city. This is evident from the fact that there have been over 60 such cases across the city recently, where the fraudsters lured the victims in the guise of a bank employee asking them to clear dues or increase the limit. Victims have lost Rs 50,000 to Rs 2 lakh.

In a recent incident of credit card fraud, a 28-year-old private employee from Borabanda lost Rs 87,000. “The accused asked for one-time-password (OTP) and said that the transaction could not be completed due to a problem,” said the victim. The victim provided his OTP seven times and in the process, lost Rs 87,000. The accused had lured him by asking him to clear his credit card dues.

In another incident, A 32-year-old businessman from Nizampet lost over Rs 50,000. According to the victim, the offenders, pretending to be from the credit card department of Axis Bank, offered to increase the card limit and sought the details. The victim provided the details and lost the money, after which the accused switched off his mobile phone.

According to the police, there have been instances where the victims have lost money without receiving the OTP. “The credit card details are sold on the dark web, the fraudsters who are based abroad get the details or buy them online and then use the details to carry out transactions. The victims in Hyderabad or Mumbai would then get a message that someone bought something with their resources in London,” said a police officer.

The last date for registration of application for Neet was January 6. Among the 510 Class 12 students, 120 have applied for the exam. The applicants include 45 for Tamil medium and 83 for English medium.

The coaching centres in Madurai are all government or aided higher secondary schools at Sokkalingapuram, Karungalakudi, Othakadai, Melur, Thiruparankundram, Kallikudi, Peraiyur, Usilampatti, Sedapatty, Alanganallur, Chekkanoorani, and Solavandhan.

“The classes are completely organized by the government and there is no tie-up with any NGO for faculty or study material,” said one of the officials responsible for co-ordinating the programme.

Officials also said they are yet to plan on conducting special camps for Neet coaching in March and April. “Last year, we had handpicked students from across the state including Madurai to attend special intensive Neet coaching camps in Theni, Chennai etc. We might organize such camps this year too,” added the official.

Panaji: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday said that compulsory military training would instill patriotism among citizens.

“I am not saying that military training should be made compulsory, but if it is done so, it will inculcate patriotism in all Indians— and today, that is required in the country”, Sawant said.

Without directly referring to the anti-CAA protests in the country, Sawant said, “I feel that there is less patriotism in the civilians in the country”, emphasising that such training would do the nation good. Sawant was speaking at ‘know your Army mela’, organised as a part of the 72nd Army Day celebration, at Campal , Panaji.

He further said when Prime Minister Narendra Modi makes any law in Parliament, it is binding on the people of this country and “our responsibility to follow the law”. Applauding the Armed forces for their role in liberating Goa from Portuguese rule, Sawant said that it is unfortunate that Goa had to wait for 14 years after India’s independence to gain freedom.

“Then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was responsible for the delay in liberating Goa,” said Sawant. “If he had political will and had really cared about Goans, then Goa would have been liberated in 1947,” he added.

MADURAI: Doctors at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in Madurai have removed a tumour weighing 150g from the heart of an 11-year-old girl.

Seethalakshmi G, a Class VI student from Tirunelveli district, had been complaining of palpitations and chest pain.

Admitted to GRH, an echo cardiogram and a CT scan revealed she has cardiac fibroma, a benign tumour in the right ventricular chamber of her heart.

Doctors performed an open-heart surgery on her on January 13 and removed the tumour sized 9cm x 6cm x 4cm and weighing 150g.

“It is a rare surgical procedure,” said Dr Rathnavel A, former head of the cardio thoracic department at GRH.

Dr Rathnavel led the team of doctors who treated Seethalakshmi.

The Glenn shunt procedure was done after the surgery to re-join the right pulmonary artery and superior vena cava to ensure proper blood flow with the right ventricle.

Alerted by neighbours and the domestic help of the doctor, Joy Basu, cops broke into the house, to find him lying on his bed. He had no pulse and was frothing at the mouth.

There was no injury and a blanket was wrapped around the body, indicating that he had probably died in sleep. “Basu had been living alone for several years. We sent his body to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital where an autopsy confirmed that he had died of cardiac arrest,” said a senior officer of the Bidhannagar commissionerate.

Basu, who was a doctor of medicine (MD), was a general physician. Cops said he suffered from schizophrenia and was under medication. “Of late, he had stopped seeing patients. A relative confirmed his condition,” the officer said.

On Monday, Basu didn’t open the door despite repeated knocks by the domestic help. She then alerted the neighbours, who called the police. “Basu’s sister said she would need three to four days to fly to Kolkata. We have informed his aunt who helped us with the legal procedures, but we can hand over the body only after his sister approves. Till she arrives, his body will be kept in a morgue,” said another officer.

An elderly neighbour said that he was a popular doctor in the area.

Jaipur: The iconic Albert Hall of Jaipur is turning out to be Jaipur’s Shaheen Bagh. From the last 11 days, over 200-500 people — mostly women in large numbers — protesting against CAA , NPR and NRC, gathering from 5pm to 7pm, are drawing attention not only from the locals but foreign visitors too.

Taking a cue from Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, everyday protest begins by a group of women raising slogans ‘Aawaz do, hum ek hai (Call, we are one). CAA ka kala kanoon wapas lo (Take back draconian CAA).’ The protest culminates at sharp 7pm, by taking a pledge over the preamble of the Constitution.

Three siblings — Saba, Huda and Mehnaz Ahmed — holding a copy of the Constitution and portrait of Baba Bhimrao Ambedkar started the protest on Tuesday, by reading the poem of Faiz Ahmed Faiz ‘Hum Dekhenge’ (We will see) and for the next two hours, the trio anchored, coordinated and managed the crowd at the venue.

“It is crystal clear that CAA is just one side of the coin and the real intention of the government is to strip the citizenship of Muslims. I am coming every day as it is about the future of my family,” said a medical student Saba, who is also joined by her father Tariq Ahmed and Gazal Parveen.

These women come from the middle class families, mostly housewives, who also bring children every day braving the chilly cold winds. The protesters chose to celebrate Makar Sankranti or the kite festival at the venue by distributing kites with a message saying ‘No to CAA, NRC and NPR’. Most of the men are young and have never participated in any protest. Sharzil Ali of Sawai Madhopur has joined as a protester and has become the most visible face among men in the protest. Building momentum every day is difficult but not impossible, says Mujahid Naqvi, one of the coordinators of the event, who every day seeks ideas from the people to make the protest attractive and creative. “By now, everybody is aware of dangers of CAA added with NRC to vulnerable communities, especially Muslims. Our protests aims at evoking the sense of activism among the last man standing and seeking support from others,” said Naqvi. Several Dalit groups have also extended their support to the daily protest.

Apart from politicians, many realtors willl test their luck in the Medchal civic body poll race.

After the completion of withdrawal of nominations, a total of 118 candidates are in the fray in 23 civic wards of Medchal municipality and over 60% of the candidates are realtors.

Explaining his reason for contesting the poll, a realtor opined, “The civic polls are being conducted for the first time after Medchal Nagarapanchayat become as municipality. There is nothing wrong in contesting the polls. We have enough money and decided to contest in the elections to serve the people. Of course, we are new for voters but as realtors, we have contacts with them.”

Another realtor said, “One need not have political experience to serve the people of Medchal. My agenda is to resolve the civic issues on top priority and being available round-the-clock for the voters.”

“The large amounts of money earned through real estate has encouraged the realtors to contest in the polls. The money may play a key role in these elections to impress the voters,” according to a political analyst.

Moreover, Medchal is among the top real estate hubs after Kompally, Gundlapochampally, Manikonda, Gachibowli and Madhapur. “All the realtors have become ‘crorepatis’ after selling out hundreds of acres due to the real estate boom for the past decade,” he said.

While major political parties including TRS, Congress and BJP have fielded their candidates in civic polls, the realtors in fray will make their political debut without parties’ support.

The fate of 118 candidates will be decided by 35,899 voters in the polls to be held on January 22.

AGRA: A delegation of Congress and National Students Union of India (NSUI) leaders met senior superintendent of police (SSP) Babloo Kumar on Tuesday and demanded action against Hariparwat station house officer Ajay Kaushal for allegedly abusing and ordering lathi-charge on protesters on Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University’s Paliwal Park campus on Saturday.

According to NSUI leaders, they complained to the SSP that Kaushal was “biased” in his action as the protesters had their allegiance to the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) were not even touched by policemen.

Congress’ district president Manoj Dixit and city president Devendra Singh said they demanded a fair investigation into the matter and immediate suspension of the SHO.

Dixit said, “The SHO should be suspended immediately for brutally beating and abusing students. NSUI state secretary Satish Sikarwar and coordinator Ankush Gautam got their hands fractured in the lathi-charge ordered by the SHO. Several other NSUI workers sustained injuries. We have video clips as evidence of his brutality.”

NSUI spokesperson Apoorv Sharma said, “Taking cognisance of the matter, the SSP assured us of a fair investigation and suitable action. We will move court if denied justice”.

On Saturday afternoon, ABVP activists had also assembled on the Paliwal Park campus and protested against recent violence on the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi and demanded that left-wing organisations should be banned on the JNU campus.

Later, NSUI and SCS members also gathered on the Paliwal Park campus and high-pitch sloganeering ensued between them that lasted for around 40 minutes. During the protest, a minor scuffle took place between members of ABVP and NSUI and police resorted to lathi-charge to disperse protesters.

Agra: Police’s claim justifying their December 15 action on AMU campus on grounds that they were summoned by the university authorities there and they did not make an unwarranted entry have proved to be inconsistent with the registrar’s letter and subsequent orders they have produced in the court, according to the lawyer for the students’ coordination committee, Asad Hayat.

The lawyer said though the affidavit filed by police states that the university registrar had requested for appropriate police force on the campus to control public order on December 15, the compliance order by the SSP was signed on December 16, a day after the police had entered the campus.

Claiming this to be a major discrepancy, which exposes both police and AMU authorities, Hayat said the students had presented these discrepancies to the National Human Rights Commission team, which is probing the alleged police aggression on the campus. Hayat said the SP (city) concerned and SSP had signed on the registrar’s letter on December 16, thus ruling out the possibility of any typographical error.

Hayat told TOI that this is an important fact, which indicates that the police entered the campus on the night of December 15 on their own and made an attempt to justify their actions by using the “hand written” letter of the AMU registrar of December 15. He alleged that this is a “post-facto” justification made by the police for their presence on university campus on the night of the violence.

When contacted, DIG Akash Kulhary said action was required on the spot and they could not have waited for the signatures during the prevailing situation on the campus then.

In the affidavit filed by the district authorities, it was stated that when the situation went beyond control, the university administration had sent a hand written letter (December 15) requesting the district administration to use appropriate force to control public order on the campus. There was no option for the district administration and police force but to enter the campus to disperse the gathering, prevent the property from being damaged and to avoid any further violence.

An injured Grey Lag Goose being treated at a rescue centre in J L N Marg on Tuesday

JAIPUR: Kite festival again turns out to be horrific day for birds. A bright sunny day with ideal kite flying conditions on Tuesday turned out to be problematic for the winged creatures in the city.

Despite a ban on the deadly glass-coated manjha (string) and mass awareness campaigns by the admin, scores of birds were grievously injured. The volunteers rescuing injured birds were ferrying them in show boxes to temporary med camps but the baskets fall short as the number of injured birds increased when the day progressed. The kite strings caused mass death of birds, both indigenous and foreign species.

A Grey Lag Geese rescued from Benar Road was diagnosed with the joint capsule rupture of wing with severe laceration of wing. “The bird underwent cross pinning to stabilize the joint. It is likely to survive,” said veterinarians Dr Ushma Patel and Dr Rina Dev who treated the bird at the makeshift bird hospital at Ramniwas Garden.

Rohit Gangwal of RAKSHA NGO holding a medical camp informed that the day saw one of the highest injured birds. “Our team of doctors have handled over 200 injured birds with many of them will never able to fly again,” said Gangwal.

Similar is the situation at a bird rescue camp at EWCS at Jain temple in Raja Park. Dr Vikas Sharma told that the rescue calls have come from even far-off areas like Bhakrota, Tail end of Sitapura and Kalawar. “I believe that more number of rescue centres must come up to handle the rising rescue calls. The far-off calls means that chances of bird survival is very low as the caller rarely guard the injured bird for an hour or two,” said Sharma.

274,['15/01/2020'],Mauvin: Won’t be able to reduce Motor Vehicles Act fines,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Representative image

PANAJI: Months after transport minister Mauvin Godinho said that he would reduce the fines imposed under the amended Motor Vehicles Act because the government didn’t “want to trouble our people”, the minister on Tuesday hinted that he may not be able to do so.

“Because of the bad conditions of the roads, I had said I will not implement the act immediately. Goa is one of the few states that has not implemented it. At the next cabinet I want them to deliberate and decide whether we will go by what the Centre says and impose the fines or whether we should relax the fines,” Godinho said, speaking at the 31st National Road Safety Week event. “But the bad news as far as relaxation is concerned is that the attorney general of India has opined that you have to go as per the central Motor Vehicles Act. ”

He urged citizens to accept the act in “good spirit” and not to engage in a campaign of negativity on social media.

He also said that a “citizens versus the government” situation should not arise when the new fines are implemented.”

The state cabinet is expected to take up discussions on the act soon and its implementation could begin in Goa this month itself.

Godinho said that he does not want a situation to arise where the Centre issues directives to Goa asking it to follow the act in toto.

“What you should do is promote positivity about road safety. Tomorrow it should not be government versus the citizen. I am sure this will happen to an extent when the new Motor Vehicles Act is implemented. Because imagine a fine going from Rs 100 to Rs 1,000 for not wearing an helmet. Who will want to shell our Rs 1,000 for not wearing a helmet? They will feel it is better to wear a helmet,” Godinho said, endorsing the need to implement the amended act.

“It is not because of a (economic) slowdown due to mining not taking place that we intend to collect more money through fines. It is a pittance what we will be collecting through fines, if you look at the shortfall. The intention is to make the road safe for citizens of Goa. Therefore, when we enforce the new law please do not feel offended that is my humble request,” Godinho said.

He said that the number of vehicles are increasing by the day and there is urgent need for road discipline.

“Government is not found wanting as far as engineering goes. We have the new Zuari bridge being build, we have the new Mandovi bridge, we have the highways being widened. But people drive so rashly that they bang into the crash barrier and go down the hill with the crash barrier, then which national highway and which government can protect you. One has to realise this and we have to ponder what is right for us. I have seen when the traffic policeman waves his hand, people avoid his hand and ride past him. What kind of society are we building? Therefore, do not feel bad when the law is enforced. You all have to follow it,” Godinho said.

Hyderabad: Four former employees of a pharma firm were arrested on Tuesday for stealing data from the company and manufacturing drugs illegally at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh.

The accused were identified as Gunturu Srikanth Reddy from Medchal, Mekala Krishna Reddy from Medipally, Mekala Venkat Reddy from Miriyala and S Yogeeswara Rao from Visakhapatnam.

Acting on a recent complaint from the company’s senior executive M.Koteshwara Rao, police registered a case against the accused.

Investigations revealed that Srikanth Reddy, who was earlier business development manager at the company, had allegedly resorted to malpractices resulting in loss and damage to the company, after which he was fired from the company in 2017.

Police said that Srikanth, who was harbouring a grudge against the management ever since his exit, instigated the company’s manager (production) Krishna and a chemist, Venkat, and lured them with a lucrative job offer at his company Hubert Healthcare Pvt Ltd in Jeedimetla.

The employees stole the company’s confidential information pertaining to batch production control records, certificate of analysis, standard testing procedure, raw data of the drugs etc. Police said that after the data was collected, Yogeeswara Rao would save the data electronically.

Panaji: Taxi operators in Goa could still tie-up with an app-based aggregator service or launch their own taxi app, said transport minister Mauvin Godinho while discussing the need to make the state more tourist-friendly. He said that if the transport sector was not regulated, Goa may stand to lose on the tourism front, as many Southeast Asian destinations were providing better options in terms of transport, cleanliness and affordable hotel rates.

“When the app-based taxi service, GoaMiles, came in, we had to face much opposition. The government had to go through hell,” he said. “Even today, I give taxi operators the option to tie up with somebody or to come up with their own app. The government has no business getting into the taxi business. We are only regulators because we have to look after the interests of the tourists who visit and the locals who need to commute,” Godinho said.

The minister said he has already stopped issuing new licences for rent-a-bike and rent-a-car services and was not renewing as many licences, keeping traffic discipline in mind.

“We are a tourist state. We have a 15 lakh population, and sometimes, 75 lakh tourists coming in, but we do not have a very happy situation where transportation is concerned. We cannot allow our tourist footfalls to reduce especially when there are cheaper destinations, especially in Southeast Asia, where traffic is regulated, people are friendlier and hotels are cheaper,” Godinho said.

AGRA: An alcoholic man and his aide were arrested by Jasrana police of Firozabad district for allegedly murdering his septuagenarian father, after the latter refused to bail out his son, who is facing huge debt.

Identified as Harprasad , the father was murdered in the intervening night of January 6 and 7 in a farm in Nagla Padman village. His son, Udayveer Singh , had then lodged an FIR of murder under IPC Section (302) against unknown men.

Rajesh Kumar, superintendent of police (rural) Firozabad said, “Udayveer, who has outstanding debt of Rs 4.5 lakh taken from 6-7 people, was infuriated with his father after the latter refused to bail him out. So he hatched a plan to eliminate his father and sell his property to repay his loans.

Panaji: Power minister Nilesh Cabral on Tuesday refuted reports about a hike in domestic power tariffs. “We have not hiked tariffs for domestic consumers, but only revised slabs under which power bills are being charged,” he said.

Cabral also said that the proposed 10 paisa tariff hike, from April onwards, is restricted to industries. Speaking on the power woes affecting residents of the coastal belt in Bardez, Cabral assured that 95 % of these problems will be resolved by May, that too without the need for constructing new a substation there. The measures undertaken, he said, will also bring relief to residents to Assagao, Candolim, Baga, Calangute and Anjuna.

Cabral also elaborated on the government’s plan to come up with a long-term solution for providing uninterrupted power supply to the state. He said he is working towards organising funding worth Rs 2,000 crore that is required to complete the works in a time-bound manner. This, he said, will ensure uninterrupted and reliable power supply to consumers for the next 30 to 50 years at least.

On the government’s proposed plan to build three extra-high voltage substations at Verna, Saligao and Tuem, Cabral said that plans for the Verna and Tuem substations have be dropped. “Work of setting up the Saligao substation will be tendered within a month.”

Meanwhile, work on the Verla-Canca power line, which was in limbo since almost one-and-half-year has been completed and the line charged, the minister said, and added that in order to resolve the problem of power shortage during the month of May, the electricity department plans on buying 20 MVA transformers. “These will help provide uninterrupted supply.”

Out of 47 persons brought to the hospital, 17 have been admitted. Among those injured are 13 children and 34 adults. The doctors remained busy all day treating the patients.

Dr Virendra Singh, who treated many at the SMS Hospital, said many persons suffered cuts in their necks by manjha. Neck bones were exposed due to injury in many cases. However, their neck vessels remained intact, he said.

Many bikes suffered serious injuries when snapped kite strings cut their nose and neck. One of the injured is 28-year-old Ravi Soni, who was riding a bike from Kishanpole to Bagru Walon Ka Rasta. He suffered deep cuts on his neck.

“I do not know from where the kite string came. I was riding the bike and I tried to grab it to protect myself. It cut my fingers and it came onto my neck. It severed my neck badly. I would have been died had I not stopped the kite string with my hand,” said Soni, who was returning to his home after purchasing kite string from Kisan Pole market.

Children also suffered serious injuries. A seven-year-old Chetan fell from rooftop, while 15-year-old Zainab’s throat suffered injury on her neck. A 17-year-old Mahtuba’s nose suffered injury, while 31-year-old Vikki, 41-year-old Lokesh, 30-year-old Gajendra and 16-year-old Aslam fell from the rooftop.

Sardinha (C) came out strongly against the Citizenship Amendment Act

MARGAO: South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha on Tuesday lent his support to the demand of locals for construction of the Benaulim stretch of the Western Bypass on stilts .

Sardinha told reporters that building the bypass on stilts was the “only solution” to prevent flooding of the area. Stating that he has spoken to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials over the issue, Sardinha said, “They say that the cost of construction of the bypass on stilts will be too high. I have told them whatever the cost, think of the posterity, because you construct only once. After the bypass is complete, the flow of traffic shouldn’t be stopped by people.”

While slamming the government for the delay in resumption of mining which he said was once the biggest employment generating sector, Sardinha spoke about the decline in tourism. Referring to the recent three deaths at an electronic music dance (EDM) event which he attributed to drug overdose, Sardinha urged the chief minister to “open your eyes and stop this before tourists stop coming to Goa”.

Speaking on the demand of the faithful to allow public access to the Anjediva island for the annual feast on February 2, Sardinha said he has already spoken to minister of state for defence Shripad Naik who, he said, has assured him to look into the matter.

Pointing out that the financial condition of the state is bad, Sardinha said, “The government is taking loans because I have heard they have no money to take the ongoing projects further. I would urge the government, please increase your resources and try to stand on your own feet.”

Sardinha also came out strongly against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). “Congressmen who died for the independence of the country have given us a secular government and a secular country. Today after so many years we can’t destroy the secularism of the country,” he said. He also decried police “brutality” on students at JNU and lamented “the sorry state of affairs of the country”.

“Religion should not be the criteria for anything in this country,” he said.

VELLORE: The Umarabad police in Tirupattur district arrested two people and launched a search for the prime accused after a warehouse of a shoe manufacturing company was set ablaze by them at Bangishop village near Ambur in the wee hours of Tuesday.

Akbar Basha, 50, of Bangishop used to supply insoles to shoe manufacturing firms in the vicinity of Ambur and Vaniyambadi and had a warehouse to stock the insoles, said a senior police officer.

Around 12 am, some road users, who spotted thick smoke emanating from the warehouse, alerted the Umarabad police. As the blaze was intense, more than 15 fire tenders from three nearby fire service stations rushed to the spot but struggled for eight hours before bringing the blaze under control. Police initially suspected an electrical short circuit may have cause the fire.

However, a police officer said, “Warehouse owner Akbar, considering its safety, did not even fix any switches inside the facility to prevent electrical accidents. Preliminary investigation revealed Mujahideen, who had enmity with Akbar, had set fire to the warehouse with the help of his associates Suresh and Aarif Khan. Prime accused Mujahideen absconded. His associates have been booked under Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. We launched a hunt to apprehend Mujahideen.”

Though the value of the property damaged was yet to be ascertained, Akbar lodged a complaint stating that more than Rs 50 lakh worth shoe manufacturing materials in the warehouse were gutted in the blaze.

287,['15/01/2020'],"U’khand lost 148 tigers in 19 years, 11 in 2019","This story is from January 15, 2020

Dehradun: Uttarakhand, which is home to over 442 tigers and hold the third position nationwide for its tiger population, lost 148 tigers in the past 19 years. In 2019, the state lost 11 tiger whereas only eight big cats died in Uttarakhand in 2018.

According to TOI sources, in 2019, nine tigers died in Corbett Tiger Reserve, followed by two in Western Circle. Data of the forest department, exclusively accessed by TOI, reveals that of the 11 deaths in 2019, five are due to infighting, followed by four due to natural causes and two due to “unknown” reasons.

So far, 72 tigers died due to natural causes, followed by 28 due to mutual fights, 19 due to unknown reasons, 15 in accidents, six in poaching, four killed after being declared man-eaters, two died in fire accidents and one each due to snake bite injury and snare traps.

Forest officials claimed that most tigers died due to ageing or in territorial fights. A senior IFS officer said, “We should not forget that Corbett landscape can handle a specific number of tigers. However, with each passing year, big cat population is increasing and this is triggering infighting for territory among tigers.”

However, Corbett director Rahul said that the landscape of the reserve has got nothing to do with the big cat deaths. “There is no specific reason behind big cat deaths. While, sometimes it is due to aging, on most occasion infighting is the main reason. It is not at all due to the landscape as tiger sustainability depends on the quality of its habitat, including prey base, water availability and security.

Meanwhile, a trans-border tiger corridor between India and Nepal is being developed, which will focus on tiger monitoring for their conservation and for conflict mitigation. The initiative is being planned with assistance from Wildlife Institute of India, Zoological Society of London and the forest department of both the countries.

288,['15/01/2020'],Uttarayani Mela starts in Bageshwar,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Bageshwar: Kumaon’s biggest cultural festival —the Uttarayani Mela — started in Bageshwar on Tuesday. The Uttarayani Mela this year also marks the 99th anniversary of the Kumaoni Satyagraha inspired by Gandhiji’s non-cooperation movement.

The annual fair which is organised on the day of Makar Sankranti at the banks of Sarayu and Gomti rivers has been the hub of trade between India and Tibet for years.

The festival started with a series of tableaux being carried out by school students of Bageshwar district depicting the local culture. “I study at a private school in the district and the Mela is the time of the year when we prepare for weeks to showcase the traditional dance forms as well as many other aspects of the Kumaoni culture,” said Neha Rawat, a student of class VIII, who took part in the tableaux.

Bageshwar district magistrate Ranjana Rajguru, meanwhile, said that the fair marks the beginning of the 100th year of the Satyagrah and therefore it has a special significance for the people of the town. “We have made all the arrangements and tourists are coming here from across the state to witness the fair,” she said.

On January 14, 1921 a group of people led by BD Pandey, also known as Kumaon Kesari, had torn the papers of the British Registers and threw them in the Sarayu river as a mark of protest against the unjust laws made by the British. This was the first non-violent protest against the British Raj on the lines of the non-cooperation movement started by Mahatma Gandhi.

The highlight of the fair, however, has been the dog market where dogs — especially the Bhotia breed — are sold by local residents.

Bhopal Arya, who owns three dogs, said that he has come from a village near Munsyari and has already sold two dogs for over Rs 40,000 to buyers from Moradabad. “I bought three dogs from locals and the breed can be used to control herds. Two of my dogs have already been bought and now I will go back to Munsyari to get more,” he said.

Meanwhile, Aslam who has bought Arya’s dogs said that he has been coming to the fair for years now and owns eight such canines. “These dogs are famous for holding together a herd of 300-400 sheep. A group of them can even fight off leopards. I now own eight of them and will make special arrangements for them since they cannot survive in the heat of the plains,” Aslam said.

Representative image

MARGAO: The Cuncolim police on Tuesday arrested two persons and are on the lookout for at least five more after a group of drunken revellers assaulted policemen and damaged their vehicles at Demani in Cuncolim in the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday.

South Goa superintendent of police Arvind Gawas told reporters that the culprits attacked police personnel after they were warned against creating nuisance on the streets.

“Police received a complaint that some persons were drinking liquor in the open and creating public nuisance. The highway patrol vehicle reached the place followed by the police patrol van. When police told the miscreants to stop drinking and go home, an altercation ensued between the group and the police,” Gawas said.

When police tried to nab one of them and put him inside the police vehicle, the rest of the group got angry and attacked them. They damaged both the police vehicles and injured four policemenbefore fleeing.

The police managed to nab two — Mayur Dessai and Shaikh Abdul Razak — and hunt is on for Sandeep Dessai, Santosh Naik, Shubham Borkar, Saish Dessai and Swapnesh Dessai, police sources said.

Police have booked the case under charges of forming unlawful assembly, rioting with deadly weapons, assaulting public servants on duty and damaging public property. Gawas said police teams have fanned out to arrest the accused who are on the run. “We will not allow people to drink on public roads, and we will not tolerate assault on police,” he said.

This is the second such incident in a little over two months of police being assaulted by persons in a drunken stupor.

Dehradun: A 37-year-old woman, identified as Parvati Devi, was attacked by tiger in Kaladhungi area on Tuesday. The victim was rescued by her friends who accompanied her to the forest for collecting fodder in the morning.

Parvati is currently undergoing treatment at Susheela Tiwari Medical College after being administered primary treatment at Kaladunngi community health centre (CHC). The victim says that she had climbed up a tree to cut its branches but she fell from the tree right in front of the big cat.

“It was a huge animal with stripes on its body and I simply fell from the tree directly in front of him. Thereafter, all I could hear was loud sounds of my children trying to shoo away the big cat,” said Parvati, while speaking to media persons at Kaladunngi CHC.

However, the forest department officials claim that the victim was attacked by a leopard and not a tiger. “Tiger stays only inside dense forest but leopards have been spotted by locals in other areas as well on several occasions. As these women had not gone deep into forests, it is likely that the victim was attacked by a leopard and not a tiger,” said BP Singh, DFO, Ramnagar.

Meanwhile, the doctors who treated Parvati at Kaladunngi CHC also couldn’t confirm whether Parvati was attacked by leopard or tiger. “She has been attacked by an animal. There are marks of nails and paws just above her neck and below her ear. But it cannot be ascertained if she was attacked by a leopard or a tiger. After providing her with primary treatment, we referred her to a to higher centre where any internal injury like brain haemorrhage can be diagnosed,” said the medical officer treating her.

The forest department would give a compensation amount to the victim in the range of Rs 15,000-Rs 50,000. The amount would depend on the medical certificate provided by the doctor. “We are yet to get accurate details from the health department. Once we get that, we will be able to divulge more information about the attack,” added Singh.

Last week, a Van Gujjar was attacked in the terai west forest division by a tiger but the forest dweller bravely fought the big cat and saved his life.

Bicholim: BJP functionaries from Sakhali, Bicholim and Mayem constituencies have condemned opposition party leaders for making ‘false allegations’ against chief minister Pramod Sawant , with regards to the Mhadei water diversion issue.

Sakhali BJP block chief Gopal Surlakar said that Sawant has been “very active” in the Mhadei agitation since 2012. “I request the Congress and other party leaders not to make false allegations against him, as far as the Mhadei issue is concerned, said Surlakar.He recollected that Sawant had also held talks with the three-member Mhadei water dispute tribunal that had came to Kankumbi in 2013, to inspect the Kalsa-Bhandura project construction and Virdi dam construction work.

Bicholim BJP block president Vishwas Gaonkar added that Sawant had organised meetings of different village panchayats and municipal councils from Bicholim, and took different resolutions pertaining to development. “One such resolution stressed that the diversion of Mhadei’s waters would affect Goa adversely, and it was passed unanimously,” he said.

Sawant told journalists that it was “ridiculous” that people who do not know about the origin, length and breadth of Mhadei were bent upon making false allegations against him. “ No Congress leader made any attempts to solve the Mhadei issue, when they held the post of chief minister,” Sawant further said.

Davangere: Just hours after he more or else admitted that the party’s central leadership had refused to lend him an ear on his plans to expand the cabinet, chief minister BS Yediyurappa was involved in a very public confrontation with a Panchamsali Lingayat seer — a prominent sub-sect of the community — who openly lobbied for a ministerial berth for an MLA.

In the presence of Yediyurappa at a function on Tuesday, Veerashaiva Lingayat Panchamasali Samaj Gurupeetha seer Vachanananda Swamiji said the community will revolt against the BJP if Yediyurappa does not induct at least three Lingayat MLAs in his cabinet. Lingayats are generally seen to favour the BJP.

""Of these, Murugesh Nirani must get a ministerial berth... He has stood like a rock behind you and this peetha. If you fail to do so, then the entire Panchamasali community will desert you,"" the seer said.

The seer had barely finished saying this when Yediyurappa jumped up from his seat and confronted the seer. ""If you talk like this, I will not stand for it. I did not expect such words from you. I cannot function as per your whims and fancies. If you continue to speak like this, I will walk out of this event,"" Yediyurappa said

The seer attempted to justify his stand and asked Yediyurappa to take his seat. But the CM continued to fume: ""You can give suggestions, but you cannot threaten me..."" he said.

Then, realising television cameras were on him, Yediyurappa sat down. He, however, rebuked Nirani on stage and was seen angrily pointing fingers at the former minister.

The seer clarified the community was only asking for its rightful share of cabinet berths considering five Lingayat legislators, including two from the Panchamasali sect — Ashok Poojar and Mahesh Kummatalli — were elected in the recent byelections.

When Yediyurappa spoke at the event, he expressed his haplessness over accommodating any of the BJP’s own. ""I would like to remind the swamiji and the people, it was because of the 17 disqualified legislators that I became the CM,"" he told the audience. ""If not for their sacrifice, I would not be sitting in this chair. Understand my position too. If the swamiji does not understand this, then I am prepared to resign from my post tomorrow itself. I am not dying to be on the CM’s chair.""

Yediyurappa urged the seer to speak to him privately on any concerns he had. ""I am ready to listen to you in private. Name the date and place and I shall sit and discuss any issue with you,"" he said.

AGRA: A fortnight after Aligarh Muslim University vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor regretted the police action on the campus on December 15 in an open letter to students and their parents, the varsity gave a complaint to local police to lodge an FIR against security personnel for “unauthorised entry into the students’ hostel on the ill-fated night”.

The local police, however, refused to lodge a case, saying the matter is sub-judice in the high court, said varsity registrar Abdul Hamid.

The varsity administration has been under pressure from protesting students who want the VC and registrar to resign “for their failure to take action against security forces for the brutality against the students”.

The VC clarified on Tuesday that the university administration had given the permission to the police “only to bring the situation to normalcy and restore public order and to clear the main road” and that they were “not supposed to enter any residential hostel”. He further said that the evidence brought to the knowledge of the university administration suggests that the “police personnel might have crossed the mandate by entering the Morrison Court hostel premises”.

Talking to TOI, vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor said, “I had allowed security forces inside the campus in order to maintain law and order situation in the university. We did not give them permission to enter the hostels.”

Adding that their entry into the hostel was illegal, Mansoor said, “I was not aware of the damage that the security forces did in the hostel.”

He said he took the decision of approaching cops for an FIR against the security forces after seeing the situation inside the Morrison Court hostel, which was sealed after the mishap to prevent the tampering of evidence. It was opened on Monday for investigating team of NHRC.

Meanwhile, the NHRC team members met the chemistry research scholar, Mohammad Tariq, who lost his hand in the violence and the doctors in AMU medical college, who treated scores of students injured in the December 15 violence. They also recorded statements of guards and other university staff, confirmed AMU proctor Afifullah Khan.

Earlier, inmates of the hostel had alleged that police not only entered the Morrison Court hostel forcefully on December 15 night, but also thrashed some of them. One of the rooms of the Morison Court hall also caught fire after RAF personnel lobbed a tear gas shell from the window, claimed students.

The university, which has to be opened in phases, started functioning on Monday, but students boycotted classes, demanding resignation of VC and registrar.

Earlier in an open letter written to students and their families on December 31, the VC had said, “I want to tell you and your families that I regret what happened (on December 15).”

Referring to the decision to call in the police on the night of December 15, he said it was taken in “good faith and a clear conscience”.He sought to assure them that he has “no intention whatsoever” of trying in any way “to subvert the right of students to protest peacefully against any legislation”which they find objectionable.

296,['15/01/2020'],"Maharashtra cotton farmers defy govt, plant ‘seeds of hope’ in fields, and hearts","This story is from January 15, 2020

YAVATMAL (Maharashtra): The evidence is on the ground. The next generation of genetically modified (GM) technology in cotton changed the life of 29-year-old Rajendra Madghane in the tribal village Ghorkhindi, 15 km from Yavatmal in eastern Maharashtra , once he got hold of unapproved variety herbicide-tolerant transgenic seeds, known as HTBt.

He procured the seeds from a fellow villager in June last year and planted it in two acres of rocky and hitherto infertile land which had never supported a crop. “It gave me 15 quintals of cotton and income of Rs 54,000 after deducting my cost. I had never seen that much of money. It’ll now help me lead a better life in our village where most of us are daily wage labourers and depend on odd jobs,” said Madghane.

Most of Ghorkhindi is infertile with patches producing Jowar (Sorghum) - a single crop in this non-irrigated area. Madghane and others are changing the area’s profile, some 23 km from centre of resistance Hiwari, which has defied the law by planting what it calls “seeds of hope” when incomes from the legally available option (Bt cotton) began to taper off.

Bt cotton is still the preferred cotton seed in Maharashtra where over 87% of cotton farms are under GM seeds, but the “revolt” of Hiwari is spreading with villages in Yavatmal, Wardha, Akola, Ahmadnagar and other districts opting for next generation GM seeds, HTBt, in the current crop year.

Over five lakh hectares of 42 lakh hectares of total land under cotton in Maharashtra is in Yavatmal.

Regulation and the law are playing catch up. “Had I continued with Bt variety, it would have been impossible for me to repay my loan to the moneylender. Use of HTBt had reduced labour cost, resulting in better returns during the ongoing picking season,” said Rupesh Thakre, a 28-year-old farmer who planted cotton in eight acres of land in Hiwari.

Many others explained how Bt variety needs use of labourers multiple times to clear weeds and how it developed a vulnerability to pink bollworm (pest) over the years, forcing indiscriminate and unscientific use of pesticides and higher costs.

Doesn’t HTBt need weedicide Glyphosate , considered hazardous for human health? “We need to spray it twice or thrice. Had this been hazardous, the government would have banned it,” said Akshaya Ramesh Mahajan of village Bori in Yavatmal district . There are many like Thakre and Mahajan in Yavatmal, Wardha and Akola who have adopted unapproved HTBt. A round of several villages reveals that three-four of 10 farmers use HTBt.

Hiwari itself has nearly 90% of its nearly 800 farmers banking on HTBt. “Farmers know they would get assured return with less cost of production. No one can do farming if there is no hope of return,” said Vijay Niwal, pointing at a signboard ‘HTBT Gram’ - the name given by farmer organisation Shetkari Sanghatana that has been leading the demand for approval of the new variety of transgenic seeds.

But, how could so many farmers get seeds not sold legally? “There are reports that the HTBt seeds are produced illegally in Gujarat and Telangana . I don’t have any authentic information about it. It, however, needs to be investigated. We have sent our reports to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR),” said V N Waghmare, director of the Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR) in Nagpur. He warns there would be no redressal of complaints if someone cheats farmers by supplying wrong seeds.

Many are sticking to legally sold GM variety - Bt cotton seeds but temptations are growing. “I would like to use HTBt once the government approves it. I am not using it at this juncture. Since use of unapproved variety is illegal, no one would assure guarantee of seeds’ quality,” said Ramkrishna Patil, a big farmer of Pandharkawda in Yavatmal district.

India allowed commercial cultivation of Bt cotton, developed by the then US-based multinational seed company Monsanto, in 2002. Its next generation of GM cotton seed (HTBt) is, however, not approved by the central biotech regulator Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC). Monsanto had submitted the application seeking approval of HTBt long ago. The company, which was formally merged with the German agro-chemical and seed company Bayer AG last year, had, however, in 2016 withdrawn its application over pricing for existing GM cotton seeds.

In the face of opposition from organisations, including RSS-linked Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), over concerns regarding health hazards due to use of Glyphosate and impacts of transgenic seeds on overall biodiversity , the government isn’t keen to push a politically sensitive case. But many stakeholders, including agriculture scientists, want government to rethink and approve seeds that passed trials on bio-safety parameters.

Though there is no application before it, the government can consider certain options. “Considering benefits of the HTBt cotton seeds, the government should invite the seed company to renew trials and application. The government must negotiate with the company and buy its technology by paying lump sum amount. The technology can then be transferred to ICAR or agricultural universities for adoption of genes in suitable varieties for commercial cultivation,” said C D Mayee, agriculture scientist and former director of the CICR.

He argued that such a move by the government will make new generation of seeds available to farmers without any additional burden to them on its cost.

Calangute: The water shortage along the Calangute-Candolim beach-belt is expected to ease up once the new water pipeline is laid from Guirim to Calangute, said ports minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo .

Lobo told reporters that the work, expected to cost nearly Rs 6 crore, is currently awaiting approval from the finance department.

Once approved and tendered, the new pipeline will be ready in about a year, he said. Two new water tanks are also currently under construction near the Calangute bus stand.

Once the pipeline is functional, these tanks will be used to store water from where it will be distributed to consumers.

A first-of-its-kind water storage facility in the state, both tanks are being constructed on the same spot, one above the other. This was necessitated due to paucity of land on the coastal stretch.

The already existing PWD overhead water tank in Calangute, also in the same vicinity, has a capacity of just 150 cubic metres of water. The new tanks will have a combined capacity of 1,850 cubic metres, a Calangute pancha specified.

“Once the tanks are ready, the water storage capacity will increase by nearly 18 times,” a panch said.

Hyderabad: In order to efficiently utilise water to produce two crops rather than one and to share nutrient resources between fish and plants, National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB), Hyderabad is aiming at promoting aquaponics (a mixture of aquaculture and hydroponics) this year across the country.

Experts see the move positively due to a shortage of water and rising prices of fish, considering the fact that the fish and plants grown in aquaponics system are organic in nature. “This farming system is commonly used in resource-limited areas to raise both fish and vegetables in an integrated system but the only issue is that it is costly and not possible for one to install it on their own. And we are helping the beneficiaries set these up,” said a senior executive, NFDB.

According to officials, the initial investment of the system is high, but the recurring cost is less and gives reasonable returns like the advantage of using less water, lesser area of land and waste renewal. “Green leafy vegetables with low to medium nutrient requirements are well adapted to aquaponics systems. The fishes are fed with quality floating pellet feed and waste generated from the fish is pumped into the troughs having horticulture plants,” he added.

Agra: The Indian Metrological Department (IMD) has predicted a phase of intermittent rainfall over the next four days in Agra. Light rainfall is expected on Wednesday and Thursday, with one or two spells of rain or thundershowers expected on Friday and Saturday, which is likely to push the mercury level down over the week.

Following light rainfall on Monday evening, cold wave intensified in the Agra region. Sky remained covered with clouds throughout the day. Air quality deteriorated to “very poor” category. Agra remained among the 10 most polluted cities in the country.

According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) was 314, which falls in the “very poor” category, with particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) the main pollutant. Upon prolonged exposure, “very poor” AQI can cause respiratory illnesses.

On Tuesday, maximum temperature in Agra was 17.5°C, 5°C below normal, while minimum temperature stood at 11.6°C.

Besides Agra, cold wave swept across Firozabad, Mathura, Etah, Aligarh and Mainpuri. Neighbouring Aligarh was colder than Agra, with maximum temperature at 16.6°C and minimum temperature at 10.6°C.

For the relief of street dwellers, Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) operated gas heaters at over a dozen places in the evening. Besides, people set up bonfires. On Sunday, over a dozen trains including Gatiman Express and Shatabdi Express ran behind schedule.

Businessmen of Sanjay Place on an indefinite strike against the Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) for charging ... Read More

AGRA: Scores of businessmen in city’s commercial hub Sanjay Place on Tuesday launched an indefinite strike against the Agra Municipal Corporation ’s (AMC) for charging parking fee at 44 places in the market.

They claimed that it violates norms as they had already paid a fee for parking space at the time of purchasing the property.

“The Sanjay Place market was developed by the Agra Development Authority (ADA). In 2005, the market was handed over to the municipal corporation. The municipal corporation was required to collect property tax, conduct maintenance work and look after street lighting and sewer system. There was no mention of collecting of parking fee in the handover document. We have already paid for the parking space. It is clearly written on the registry of the properties available with the property owners. The parking contracts raised by the AMC administration are completely illegal,” Hiren Agarwal, secretary of the Sanjay Place market association said.

Meanwhile, the leaders of Sanjay Palace market association have decided to give up their BJP membership if the AMC fails to withdraw the contract proposal.

“Almost all the businessmen of Sanjay Place have been supporting BJP in every possible way. It is very unfortunate that despite having BJP government at the Centre and state, we are being exploited. BJP Mayor Naveen Jain has failed to address our issues,” Association's treasurer Vinay Mittal said,

“We will end our several years old loyalty to the BJP if the parking contracts raised by the AMC are not cancelled,” he added.

Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Arun Prakash said, “The claims made by the market association leaders are misleading. Contracts have been issued for parking on public space, which is the right of the municipal corporation. We have brought all the facts to the notice of the court. No change will be made in the parking system in Sanjay Place.”

The dispute over parking began when a group of 10 businessman of Sanjay Place filed a case at the Agra sessions court in 2008 when the contract for parking space was first issued. The court later put a stay on the AMC order for five years. In October 2019, the municipal corporation again raised the parking contract for Sanjay Place after which the businessmen applied in the court to reopen the case.

301,['15/01/2020'],"Siddaramaiah meets Sonia, pitches for aide MB Patil for KPCC prez job","This story is from January 15, 2020

Bengaluru: The on-going process to select a new Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president is likely to drag on for few more days with former CM and opposition leader Siddaramaiah making a strong pitch for former minister MB Patil over DK Shivakumar for the post.

Siddaramaiah, who met AICC president Sonia Gandhi and other senior Congress leaders in New Delhi on Tuesday, reportedly argued in favour of Patil, saying his elevation would help the party win Lingayats to the fold.

“Yediyurappa, the undisputed leader of the Lingayat community, is almost at the end of his career and it is an opportunity for the Congress to gain the confidence of the community. Being a leader from North Karnataka, Patil fits the bill perfectly,” Siddaramaiah reportedly told Sonia.

Siddaramaiah is said to be backing Patil over Shivakumar as he is worried about losing his hold over the state unit, given Shivakumar’s popularity. While Sonia did give the former CM a patient hearing, she is said to have told him that he should obey and cooperate with whatever decision high command takes.

The high command is looking to evolve consensus on the new state president. “Sonia’s meeting with Siddaramaiah is part of this exercise. She wants to keep everybody in the loop,” said a functionary.

Siddaramaiah also met senior leaders Ahmed Patel and AK Anthony. He is expected to meet former AICC president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday.

However, some including Mallikarjun Kharge and Shamanur Shivashankarappa have expressed reservations against Patil’s elevation, pointing to his role in the controversial separate Lingayat religion issue which dented the Congress’ prospects in the 2018 assembly polls.

“He has a very bad name among Lingayats and making him president would prove counter-productive. Moreover, it is difficult to win back Lingayats as long as Yediyurappa is active in politics,” said a senior Congress leader.

Another functionary said a majority of state functionaries — and even some in the high command — favour Shivakumar as he is not only “resourceful”, but also has momentum. “With HD Deve Gowda and HD Kumaraswamy losing popularity among Vokkaligas, the possibility of the community backing Shivakumar is high. This may land him the top job,” the functionary said.

Vasco: Undercurrents brewing in Vasco’s political arena came to light on Tuesday after the port town’s police stopped the erection of a flag post in front of the railway station on Tuesday based on “an anonymous call” stating that the project did not have permission. Mormugao Municipal Council (MMC) councillor Krishna Salkar, who had proposed the idea of erecting the national flag told TOI, “It is a politician from Vasco, who is jealous as he will not get any mileage.”

Refusing to name the politician, he clarified that the ruling council had no role to play in this. The South Western Railway had undertaken the project. Krishna’s wife Shammi said that the MMC chairperson had given them the go ahead and even directed his staff to provide temporary power supply to facilitate the work.

“Around 12.30pm, police arrived and told us to stop the work stating that we had no permissions. Till 5.30pm we were at the police station asking them to show us the complaint. Later they told us to go ahead with the installation,” Shammi said.

Vasco PI Nilesh Rane said they received an anonymous call about an illegal construction in front of the station. “We told the person to settle it with the MMC, but as it was their lunch time, the complainant asked us to check out the work,” Rane said. “After checking the inwarded letter to the MMC chief officer, we told them to go ahead with the work,” he said. Station manager Ramdas Gudemane said, “On December 31, we had inwarded a letter before the MMC CO and got verbal permission. I have contacted the Vasco MLA. He has asked me to meet him on Wednesday.”

NEW DELHI: Jamia Millia Islamia vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar met Amit Khare, secretary for higher education, MHRD , on Tuesday and briefed him about the cancellation of the ongoing examinations. Akhtar again requested the ministry to set up an inquiry on the police action in the university on December 15.

The VC also met Delhi Police commissioner Amulya Patnaik and urged him to lodge an FIR in connection with the violence, university officials said.

An HRD official said that the VC was not invited but she paid a visit to brief them about the circumstances on why exams at the university were cancelled. “Akhtar also reiterated her earlier demand for a probe into the December 15 violence. The request has been forwarded to the ministry,” the official added.

On Monday, Akhtar had said the varsity administration will “explore the possibility” of moving court for registration of an FIR against “police brutality” on the campus after hundreds of angry students gheraoed her office demanding action against Delhi Police. Students on Monday had demanded that the VC file an FIR against the cops. Akhtar had then announced that the exams in the campus were cancelled and an Executive Council meeting on Tuesday would decide the plans to take up legal recourse.

The EC meeting, however, could not happen due to absence of several members as the meeting was called at a short notice.

On December 15, as violence over the Citizenship Amendment Act flared up, police personnel entered the campus and cracked down on students, leaving several injured. Since then the university has been witnessing constant protests.

Panaji: Two police complaints have been filed by residents of Old Goa and Carambolim, and by the Carambolim panchayat, over the Corporation of the City of Panaji’s “illegal” dumping of “unburnt/burnt/wet and stinking garbage” at Carambolim on Monday.

The Old Goa police seized six trucks that were transporting garbage from CCP’s wet waste facility at Patto that caught fire on Monday, to a private property in Carambolim, on the border of Old Goa.

Locals noticed the dumping only at 8 pm on Monday and protested against it, stating that it was taking place illegally, without the permission of the Carambolim panchayat and was posing a threat to the heritage fortress wall that runs through Old Goa and Carambolim. The locals in their complaint demanded an investigation into the 50-odd truck loads of waste dumped there.

Old Goa resident Glean Cabral said the waste hadn’t been cleared despite assurances from Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar, who was supervising work at the site Monday evening. No permissions were taken from the Carambolim panchayat in whose jurisdiction the waste was dumped, he said.

Former NIO senior principal scientist Arvind Kumar Saran said the waste was not completely dry, and was mixed with plastic, and emanating an unbearable stench.

“There is a strong feeling of distrust among the people. Waste from the municipal area is being dumped in panchayat jurisdiction. They thought it would go unnoticed,” he said.

The villagers from Carambolim and Old Goa were called for a meeting late Tuesday night, and were asked to be on the alert for dumping of garbage in their respective localities.

Mayor Madkaikar said that it was not garbage that was dumped, but “half-treated compost”.Compost was taken to the site last year and the owner granted permission to CCP to dump the compost there, he stated.

“ We told them we will remove it if they wish. We just have to screen it. It is all dried compost. It began to smell because water was used to douse the fire. We were instructed to remove it by fire service personnel,” Madkaikar told TOI. A massive fire was also reported at the proposed site of the garbage treatment plant at Bainguinim on Monday morning. It was doused in the afternoon.

Bhubaneswar: The East Coast Railway (ECoR) will set up a cyber cell to investigate cases related to e-ticketing frauds at its headquarters in Bhubaneswar.

Raja Ram, principal chief security commissioner of ECoR, said the cell was likely to be functional within the next three months. “We hope that the cyber cell will add teeth to our railway protection force (RPF) in dealing with cyber crimes, especially e-ticketing frauds,” he added.

Ram said, “The primary job of the cell will be to identify touts who hoard tickets by creating fake user IDs on IRCTC website and trace their networks. The cell will have modern gadgets to help RPF personnel gather digital evidence and retrieve lost/deleted data from a computer for investigation.”

In 2019, RPF personnel have arrested 164 persons on charges of committing e-ticketing frauds under the ECoR jurisdiction. Tickets worth more than Rs 1.2 lakh were seized from the accused, including travel agents. The Railway police said they blocked at least 1,006 fake online user IDs last year. The RPF had launched special drives under the banners of Prabal and Thunder for a wider crackdown on touts.

Ram said ECoR has taken a slew of measures to strengthen security at stations, including Bhubaneswar. Statistics showed that the incidents of stone pelting on running trains increased to 36 in 2019 from 10 in 2018. RPF personnel had arrested 19 persons, mostly juveniles, on charges of stone pelting in 2019 as against eight in 2018.

“We identified at least 13 vulnerable locations, mostly inhabited by slum dwellers, along the tracks under the ECoR jurisdiction. Reports showed that attackers, who were mostly children, were having fun by pelting stones on trains. We have been organising sensitization programmes in slums to dissuade people from doing so,” Ram said.

The ECoR said incidents of chain-pulling came down in 2019 as compared to 2018. At least 5,039 such incidents were reported from 5,860 trains. Altogether 2,579 people were arrested in 2018. The numbers came down to 3,801 in 3,666 trains in 2019. The total number of arrests stood at 2,841 in 2019.

Ram said crackdown on coal thieves in goods trains has been intensified. In 2019, at least 35 coal theft cases were registered and 71 persons held. “We appeal to the citizens to call us on our helpline number (182) or send photographs/videos of illegal activities in trains or on railway properties on our social media channels for prompt action,” he added.

The ECoR said incidents involving deaths of passengers on track due to negligence while on train witnessed a marginal drop in 2019. While 1,012 passengers had died after accidentally falling off from running trains in 2018, the number came down to 989 in 2019.

CHENNAI: Actor Rajinikanth has stirred a controversy with his one-liner that a person with a copy of “Murasoli” (DMK’s mouthpiece) can be identified as a DMK man , while one with a copy of “Tuglak” can be termed an “intellectual”.

Addressing a gathering at an event to release the 50th anniversary special magazine of the Tamil weekly Tuglak in the city on Tuesday in the presence of Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu, the actor heaped praise on the magazine’s late founder-editor Cho Ramaswamy.

Noting that present-day politics was “in a sorry state of affairs”, Rajinikanth underscored the role of the media and the need to have journalists like Cho. Indicating that media houses owned by political parties take a stand on issues, the actor said, “Media should be unbiased and bring out the truth for people. Do not portray lies as truth.”

Before beginning his address, the actor made it clear that his speech will be apolitical due to the presence of the Vice-President and the protocol in place. “I will speak at an appropriate time,” he added, amid applause. As a word of advice, he said, “If you look at a problem as being permanent, it will become a disease. Rather, consider it temporary like Cho did, and thus, he became a great man.”

Venkaiah Naidu said even as he exited politics, Rajinikanth was entering the fray.

Responding to a question raised by a reader on whether Rajinikanth would make an impact on politics in the future, Tuglak editor and RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy said the actor was “no ordinary man”. “He is aware of his responsibilities. We have to leave him to take the right decision at the right time,” he said, adding that it would be “a positive outcome” ahead of the 2021 assembly elections.

Recollecting his conversation with Cho on Rajinikanth, Gurumurthy said, “He (Cho) frequently told me that Rajinikanth wanted to do good for the people and he will enter politics.”

On the occasion, Prime Minister Narendran Modi’s recorded speech was screened. He praised Cho as a great journalist and emphasised the role of the media in highlighting the government’s welfare schemes. He lauded Tamil Nadu as home of the “world’s oldest language” and said the state was in the forefront in various sectors.

Aristes in a scene from the play staged at VNIT

Nagpur: Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) stood testimony to camaraderie between students of various departments during annual ‘Institute Gathering’, its biggest ever event, that saw their best in literary, artistic, athletic and other creative fields.

Students were emotionally charged as the extravaganza will conclude on Wednesday evening with the valedictory function. VNIT director PM Padole will be the chief guest while dean (student welfare) BS Umre will be in the chair.

The Times of India was the print partner of the event.

‘Institute Gathering’ (IG) is organized by the Student Council in which all departments get a platform to showcase their talent. More than 95 events held in the course of ten days were curated to encourage bonding between various departments.

While kabaddi, kho-kho, cricket and basketball matches, besides others, tested the physical strength of students, literary and creative events gave them food for thought.

Slam poetry, JAM, creative writing competitions and cultural events like street and stage plays, dance performances and competitions and stand-up comedy were outstanding.

The events included ‘Triathlon’ which had cycling, running, long jump and hurdles, besides others. Stage play was also an exciting and challenging event in which all the eight departments gave 20-minute performance each. The teams were given words based themes like ‘ink’, ‘table’, ‘chair’ etc to choose from, and write and present a play that centred around it.

Tug of war, collage and rangoli making were enjoyed by the students. There were informal events too like poker, NFS, FIFA, DOTA and Counterstrike. In fact, there was something for everyone at the IG.

The spectacular events were made memorable by the hard work put in by the team of Student Council consisting of general secretary Yogesh Patil, secretaries Aditya Kumar (academic affairs), Mohit Rathi (cultural affairs), Chaitya Chheda (sports), Gyan Pratik Singh (alumni affairs), Jidnyasa Badwaik (training and placement), Ayush Singh (technical), Sanket Joag (magazine and literary affairs), Shuvendu Ranabijuli (hostel affairs for boys), Prachi Janorkar (hostel affairs for girls), Mohsin Khan (PG sports and cultural), Saurabh Dharmare (PG social affairs), Saurabh Khairnar (PG academic affairs) and ladies’ representative Vaishnavi Shringi.

310,['15/01/2020'],Relief at Centre nod to transfer approvals to new bidders,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Bhubaneswar: The state government has welcomed the Centre’s recent decision to transfer the existing forest and environment clearances of mining blocks, lease period of which will end on March 31, to the new lease holders, who will be selected through the ongoing auction process.

The decision will help the new lease holders to start mining production immediately. It, generally, takes two years for new lease holders to start mining operation from a block by obtaining various approvals like forest and environment clearances.

The Centre’s decision is part of the mineral laws (amendment) ordinance approved by the Union cabinet on January 8. As per the decision, the name of the lease holder would only change after March 31 while production would continue as usual.

“Since the state government has approached the Centre to transfer the existing clearances in favour of the new lease holders, its a favourable decision for us. There would be no disruption in mining production and supply to the ore-based industries,” said mines director Deepak Mohanty.

As many as 20 mines, including 12 iron ore, lease period of which would end on March 31, have been put on auction by the state government. Immediate start of ore production from these blocks by the new lease holders after March 31 is crucial as these 12 iron ore blocks produce around 50 million tonne of ore annually against states total annual iron ore production of 120 MT. Delay in start of production from these blocks would also have a negative impact on state’s revenue collection as Odisha earns a major portion of its revenue from mining and metal sector.

The Centre’s decision also came as a big sigh of relief for the ore-based industries, who had earlier expressed concern over the situation and urged the state government to find out alternatives. A top executive of an Odisha-based steel plant termed the decision a big-relief for them as they would continue to get raw material.

It is this video that his counsel will use on Friday to try and keep him from getting jail time.Karnati stands charged with conspiracy to commit visa fraud in the US in the University of Farmington case. His counsel is arguing that he be allowed to leave the country without serving time owing to the hardships his family will face otherwise.A ‘downward variance’, as it is called, would allow Karnati to return to Hyderabad. He faces between 24-30 months of prison time as per the advisory guidelines of the probation department. The final sentencing could be above or below the range. Karnati and seven others are accused of recruiting students to enrol in the University of Farmington, a fake university, operated by Homeland Security agents.“Farmington University held itself out to be completely legitimate, and only the most cynical person would have imagined it was a trap by the government,” said Anjali Prasad, a Detroit-based criminal defence attorney and former federal prosecutor representing Karnati. “Genuine, hard-working, educated people don’t think that way. They trust and believe.”Speaking about the trauma Karnati has been through, Prasad said, “This has been an absolute gruelling experience for my client who believed the University was in its infant stages with online classes.”The sentencing memorandum, which seeks to provide a complete picture of Karnati, will be placed before the United States District Court Eastern District of Michigan on Friday.Karnati’s sentence will rest on how the hardship of the family will be viewed. The memorandum states: “Regardless of what sentence the court imposes, Karnati’s wife and two minor children must leave the United States. That is because Mrs Karnati and their nine-year-old son carry H-4 visas, which are issued to dependents of an H-1B visa holder.Karnati anticipates non-renewal of his H-1B visa in the next 60 days. Once Karnati’s visa expires or becomes revoked, so will his wife and eldest son’s.” Karnati’s three-year-old son is a US citizen.The memorandum will further highlight how the family is dependent on Karnati. “If Karnati receives a custodial sentence, his family will have no choice but to leave the country without him. In addition to lacking his physical and emotional support as they return to India, the family will be without means in India since Karnati is the sole provider for his family,” the memorandum states.In September 2019, Karnati pleaded guilty to a single count indictment charging ‘conspiracy to commit visa fraud and harbor aliens for profit’ in the now notorious University of Farmington fake university case.Over 250, Indians, including many Telugu students, were arrested or sent back over the issue. Karnati has already paid $11,700 obtained through 39 student enrolments made to the University of Farmington, for which he was paid $300 per student.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73265094,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-123585,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/family-of-farmington-accused-will-suffer-most-if-he-is-found-guilty/articleshow/73258586.cms

Bhubaneswar: The Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) and Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) have decided to demolish 175 illegal buildings that have come up on government land or has not compiled with building norms. The demolition will be carried out in a phased manner with the help of excavators.

The decision comes days after the Odisha Development Authority (ODA) court gave the go-ahead for demolition of the illegal structures. Altogether 6,000 disputed cases related to building rules violations are pending in BDA and BMC courts, which are being heard. Only in the case of 175 apartments the ODA court hearing has been final. BDA vice-chairman and BMC commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhury said the demolition will be carried out using excavators as they are small buildings. “The demolition will be carried out as per ODA court order. But those who have appealed before the higher authority or moved the Orissa high court seeking stay, their buildings will not be demolished till the disposal of their cases,” Chaudhury said.

Chaudhury said the nature of violations committed by the developers vary from building to building. “While many have constructed buildings illegally on government land, drains or natural nullahs, others have not complied with mandatory norms,” Chaudhury added.

Around 1200 families are likely to be affected if the 175 apartments are razed. As per Section 92(2) of ODA (Amendment) Act, 2015, the BDA and BMC can seal the illegal buildings before demolishing them.

Before carrying out the demolition, the BDA and BMC will make a joint appeal to the occupants to vacate the buildings will all their belongings.

After the ODA court’s order, people have the option to appeal to the appellate authority in the housing and urban development (H&UD) department. If the verdict by the appellate authority goes against them, they can move the high court.

The cases related to building rule violations are decided in the ODA courts in BMC and BDA. The 175 apartments against which the demolition has been ordered are the ones whose fate has been decided in both the courts. The apartments which fall under BMC jurisdiction will get demolition notice from BMC court and the ones coming under BDA jurisdiction will get notice from the BDA.

Kolkata: West Bengal is yet to get GST compensation for last three months despite repeated request to Centre. This was disclosed on Tuesday by state finance and industries minister Amit Mitra after a pre budget meeting with the chambers. Mitra pointed out that state has not received GST compensation for October, November and December. The total shortfall in collection for these months is around Rs 2,000 crore. GST compensation for August and September also was released late. Incidentally, as per GST regulation, if the GST collection falls below 14% growth of the last year in month to month basis then states will get a compensation. This would be valid for five years since the roll out of GST.

“GST we are not in good shape. There is below 14% growth but not getting compensation. This is our constituional right and CM has also communicated to PM about this dues,” he added. Mitra also cautioned about stagflation like situation prevailing in the economy where inflation is being coupled with unemployment. “It has never happened in India. In US there was stagflation once in mid seventies.” he added.

Commenting on the meeting with chambers, Mitra added that there was 60 representatives from 19 chambers that included national chambers like FICCI, CII, Assocham, other leading chambers like ICC, MCC, Bharat Chamber, BNCCI and district level chambers. “It was a very good meeting. They are asking to do something to support production,” he added. According to Mitra, there was discussion in issues like assessment of demand for training in different sector, skill development, entrepreneurship development along with others. “The banks will give Rs 70,000 crore credit to small businesses this year, we have already trained the officers in district industry centres (DIC) by IIM, Kolkata,” he added.

317,['15/01/2020'],First skin bank in twin states may come up in Hyderabad soon,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: With an average of 100 burn patients landing at the Osmania General Hospital (OGH) in a month for skin grafting and 7,000 patients a year, the hospital is planning to set up the first skin bank in the twin Telugu states soon.At present, both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh don’t have a skin bank, which hampers large grafts. While larger grafts are typically required by patients with severe burns, nearly half of them do not survive.“Skin burns leave open wounds. Without the protective layer of skin, dehydration and body temperature loss happens. In case of severe burns, multi-organ function is affected within three to five days. With all the electrolyte imbalances and impact of organs, patients do not survive easily. With skin grafting, once the protective layer of the skin is back, the wound starts healing and it improves the survival rate,” said a senior doctor associated with the project.In the absence of this protective layer, many severe burns patients succumb quickly. The OGH skin bank, which will be the first in the twin states, can meet the demand of nearby states, as only one skin bank in the private sector is currently operating in entire southern India, said doctors.“We have sent the proposal for setting up a skin bank to the government. It will be managed by the plastic surgery department,” said hospital superintendent, Dr B Nagender.Currently, plastic surgeons carry out grafting by taking skin from one part of the body and transplanting it to another. This does not allow large grafting and the alternative dressing of collagen sheet is a very expensive option. Meanwhile, skin banks use skin from cadavers (donated), which is then cleaned up in various solutions to wash off any antibodies and kept ready for grafting.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73264602,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-54527,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/first-skin-bank-in-twin-states-may-come-up-in-hyd-soon/articleshow/73258613.cms

Representative image

NEW DELHI: In the Rs 800 crore Foreign Exchange Management Act violation case against Amrapali group and J P Morgan, the Enforcement Directorate has made HDFC Bank and Bank of Baroda parties in the “unauthorised” repatriation of over Rs 187 crore, made without taking RBI’s approval.

HDFC Bank is likely to face a penalty over “unauthorised remittance” of Rs 140 crore to J P Morgan while Bank of Baroda is being held liable for repatriation of Rs 47.3 crore which the ED claims are illegal transactions in violation of FEMA rules and lacking RBI approval. The ED complaint claimed two shell companies of Amrapali promoters were used to move money out of India by hugely inflating share prices.

The ED issued summons to the banks seeking clarification on the “unauthorised remittances” but they failed to respond, sources said. When TOI sought comments from the two banks, a spokesperson for HDFC Bank said the bank was not aware of any such summons. No response was received from Bank of Baroda.

The investigating agency, likely to take Amrapali promoters in custody this week for questioning, named the two banks in its FEMA complaint filed on January 8. The FEMA complaint is equivalent to a chargesheet and further proceedings before the special director of ED, a quasi-judicial authority, will determine the amount of penalty that may be levied on the two banks.

The ED has also registered a separate case against Amrapali and J P Morgan under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) for attachment of properties. The agency has also questioned former nominee directors of J P Morgan, who were on the board of Amrapali Zodiac and Amrapali Silicon City, under PMLA. Amrapali has been accused of making dummy directors in “collusion” with J P Morgan to siphon off homebuyers’ money.

On Monday, the ED informed Supreme Court that a PMLA court in Lucknow had issued three production warrants against directors of Amrapali group to join investigation. The agency urged the apex court to issue directives for custodial interrogation of the accused Amrapali directors.

NEW DELHI: Amid reports of cultivation of unapproved variety of transgenic HTBt cotton seeds, the Union environment ministry has written to the chief secretary of Maharashtra for “taking necessary action” and requested the state to “provide lateral flow strip test kits for preliminary field level testing” to frontline staff who visit the fields for inspections.“A reply from the government of Maharashtra is awaited,” said the central regulator, Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), secretariat under the ministry while responding to TOI’s questions on cultivation of HTBt episode in several districts of the state.Since cultivation of unapproved variety of genetically modified (GM) seeds is illegal in India, it is the responsibility of chief secretary, being chairperson for the State Biotechnology Coordination Committee (SBCC), to take action against such practice.As per rules for the Manufacture, Use, Import, Export and Storage of Hazardous Micro-organisms or Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells, 1989, the SBCC serves as a nodal point at state level for coordinating activities related to GMOs in the state. There is also a provision of District Level Committees (DLC) which serves as a nodal point at district level.Farmers, however told TOI during farm visits to different villages in Yavatmal and Wardha districts on last Saturday and Sunday that they did not find any difficulty in procuring HTBt seeds. “Though such seeds are not sold by licensed seed retailers, we could get it easily through network of farmers,” said Madhusudan Harne at village Shegaon (Kund) of Hinganghat taluk in Wardha district. Harne planted both approved (Bt cotton) and unapproved (HTBt cotton) varieties of seeds in his separate farms.The issue was earlier flagged by the environment ministry to the Maharashtra government in 2019 when it came to know about suspected illegal cultivation of HTBt cotton in villages of Akola district .“In reply, the government of Maharashtra has confirmed presence of HT positive cotton seeds in Akola district and has filed two FIRs against responsible persons,” the GEAC secretariat told TOI.In the backdrop of Maharashtra episode and detection of illegal cultivation of GM brinjal in Fatehabad district of Haryana last year, the ministry had then written to chief secretaries of all states/UTs to constitute and strengthen SBCC and DLCs and take penal action under Section 15, 16 and 17 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, in case cultivation of illegal GM crops are detected.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73262336,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-559207,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/htbt-seeds-illegal-but-its-easy-to-procure-them-say-farmers/articleshow/73260756.cms

Colva: As many as 13 coconut trees with a height of 8-10m have been cut down by the Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) in the children’s park at Colva beach to make space for the construction of a toilet block for beach development and beautification works.

The Union government has sanctioned Rs 11.7 crore for the works to turn it into an iconic beach under the Tourists Sites Development project. The cluster of coconut trees in an area admeasuring 2,000 sqm with its front to the beach would provide shade to visitors.

Colva panch member Pio Furtado said that GTDC personnel showed them permission from the deputy conservator of forests to cut 13 trees. Furtado said that he requested them not to cut all 13 but to chop only four to make enough space to build the toilets but the official told him that it would be difficult for them to cut the remaining trees individually at a later stage.

Director of tourism Menino D’Souza said he is aware of trees being chopped down for toilet blocks. He added that the property has been handed over to GTDC for the development and they have permission to cut the trees.

The tourism department also allowed the children’s park to be used as a transfer point for garbage collected from shacks and beach stretch from Cavelossim to Arrosim.

GTDC executive engineer Kiran Kumar said that the earlier plan was to construct the toilet block at the far end of the children’s park but the public objected because of the presence of a chapel. He added that the block consists of washrooms for ladies, gents and handicapped and they also have CRZ clearance. Kumar says that in place of the 13 trees they will plant 39 coconut palms as per the conditions of the forest department.

The works undertaken by GTDC under the project include road beautification at Colva beach, beautification of existing islands, pathways, drainage, construction of toilet blocks with changing rooms, four-wheeler parking for 80 vehicles and two-wheeler parking for 327 vehicles, bus parking for 54 vehicles, play equipment for children’s play area, landscaping and illumination.

New Delhi: Hundreds of lawyers under the banner of ‘Lawyers for Democracy’ on Tuesday marched from the Supreme Court to Jantar Mantar opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Lawyers raised slogans against the government and stated that the educational institutions should not speak the language of the government. The march also led to traffic disruptions in and around Central Delhi.

The protest march began around 3.30pm outside the apex court with Sanjay Hedge, senior advocate at Supreme Court, reading out the Preamble. Somdutt Sharma, convener of Lawyers for Democracy, then led the protest. He repeatedly requested the participants to ensure that no miscreants entered their protest.

“Both CAA and NRC strike at the core of the constitutional values and are against the idea of a secular democracy. Religion should be no basis of giving citizenship to people. The six communities, which have been mentioned in the act, are already living in India and can apply for citizenship even through the citizenship act. Then what was the need to amend it,” said Somdutt.

Women lawyers, who were a part of the protest, also included Surya Rajapan. She had to shift her house after she protested against CAA and NRC during Union home minister Amit Shah’s visit to Lajpat Nagar. “The new Act is against the constitutional values where religion has been made a base for citizenship. The government is an elected representative of the people of this country. If there is a dissent, why can’t they have a dialogue,” asked Rajapan.

NEW DELHI: A day after it stayed away from the joint opposition meeting, DMK said it skipped the gathering in protest against Tamil Nadu Congress’s accusation that M K Stalin had violated the coalition dharma, its gripe again highlighting that state-level pinpricks were impacting coordination in the anti-BJP axis at the national level.

Senior DMK leader T R Baalu said, “We did not take part in the meeting since our chief was accused of violating coalition dharma (over local body elections).” He said only time would tell if the relations between DMK and Congress would come back to normal.

At the same time, TN Congress chief K S Alagiri met party president Sonia Gandhi and told reporters that there was no bitterness among the TN allies. Downplaying the discord, he said, “The coalition is going on good, I have told our party chief.”

DMK along with Trinamool Congress, BSP, SP and Shiv Sena skipped the joint meeting called to discuss the CAA-NRC-NPR controversy as also economic downturn.

DMK was not alone to complain against Congress. Earlier, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee accused the Congress-Left compact of violence during the national strike in Bengal last week and accused it of conspiring against the state government.

Left and Congress are rivals to ruling TMC in Bengal while they are together in the national opposition camp against BJP.

Interestingly, BSP chief Mayawati said her party was skipping the meeting since Congress had poached upon BSP MLAs in Rajasthan.

The fact is that BSP has been targeting Congress since AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra stepped up organisational and agitational activities on its turf of Uttar Pradesh.

With the national opposition umbrella comprising both partners and rivals in states, the abstentions at the Monday meeting brought to the fore the complications that competitive politics was creating in coordinating a joint stance against BJP.

While the brainstorming issued a strong statement against BJP and drew up an agitation plan, the anti-Modi offensive was diluted by the news of cracks in opposition unity.

There appeared a regret in Congress about the turn of events even though managers pointed out that 20 parties had come together at the meeting. Also, it was pointed out that DMK and TMC, despite staying away, were vociferously opposing CAA-NRC-NPR, and stay bitterly against BJP. Also, Shiv Sena on Monday declared for the first time that the Maharashtra government would not implement CAA in its present form.

It was felt that problems like in Bengal cannot be avoided since the Congress-Left have to fight against a vehemently “dictatorial” ruling TMC. But party office-bearers added that care would have to be taken to ensure that minor issues don’t impede the relationship over bigger projects.

324,['15/01/2020'],"NU’s reval applications jumped by nearly 25,000 in 3 years","This story is from January 15, 2020

Nagpur: Even as Nagpur University (NU) claims to have significantly reduced the number of revaluation applications, which once used to cross one lakh mark a few years ago, its own reply under the RTI Act bellies its own claims.

In its reply to a slew of queries by RTI activist Abhay Kolarkar, the university’s assistant registrar Manoj Joshi mentioned about the number of students applying for the revaluation, which proves that the figures are increasing with each exam.

In 2016 summer examination, about 20,858 students applied for revaluation which jumped to over 45,500 in 2019. Even the funds collected from the students towards revaluation applications have witnessed a surge. From Rs47.66 lakh in 2016-17, fee collection increased to Rs1.66 crore in 2018-19.

On refunding fees of those who cleared in revaluation, Joshi said their office didn’t’ have any instructions in this regard, despite VC SP Kane announcing it in 2016 while terming it as “one of his dreams”. It was reported by TOI on October 23, 2016, when the VC first declared about his intentions of refunding the students.

Pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande told TOI that he wasn’t aware of the RTI reply, but he would seek information from his subordinates in this regard. “We need to see the jump from the perspective of number of students appeared for summer and winter exams in all these years, along with those who applied for the revaluation. The university permits two papers in one semester for revaluation. Change may be due to the number of subjects applied for it,” he said.

Till 2016-17, revaluation was a major headache both for NU authorities and students due to old system of photocopy. The results used to witness inordinate delay of at least three months to one year in some cases on account of old rules.

After introduction of semester system, a majority of applicants used to get revaluation results after the supplementary exams. Thousands lost their precious academic year due to this delay, as they used to clear the subjects after winter exams.

Subsequently, the NU used to face large-scale protests throughout the year and it was the biggest bone of contention between the students and authorities. TOI regularly exposed NU’s apathy on how hundreds of innocent students lost their precious academic year due to delay in revaluation results.

NU authorities claimed that things had changed drastically after the introduction of online system from Promarc company. They used to claim that the number of applicants had reduced significantly and even revaluation results were declared within a week. Though their claims were found to be correct to some extent, there is no denying the fact that those applying for revaluation have jumped drastically, as per the RTI reply, Kolarkar told TOI.

PUNE: The civic body has decided to assess how the increased Floor Space Index (FSI), to be allotted for the Metro rail project, will impact the city.The standing committee of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Tuesday approved the civic administration’s proposal to hire a private consultant at Rs1.19 crore to assess the real estate development and its cascading effect in the Metro’s transit oriented development (TOD) zone.The civic administration has declared up to 4 FSI along the TOD zone within a 500m radius of the Metro stations. Factors such as road width, plot size and distance of a plot from a station will be considered while allotting the FSI.“The allotment of the additional FSI will certainly put pressure on the civic infrastructure and municipal services. Amenities have to be improved for this. A study by the consultant will focus on all these factors,” standing committee chairperson Hemant Rasane said.“The current status of development along the TOD zone and the future prospects will be studied. The consultant will suggest ways of sustainable development along the TOD zone,” said Yuvraj Deshmukh, a senior official in the PMC’s building permission department.“The study will be carried out in accordance with the state and the Centre’s directives within nine months. The study will focus on all Metro corridors. The impact of development along the Bus Rapid Transit System and High Capacity Mass Transit Route areas will also be assessed,” he said.The state government had in March last year announced transit oriented development in a 500m radius around Metro stations in the city and fixed the maximum permissible FSI at 4. The government had then told the PMC to undertake an impact assessment study of the policy and prepare a comprehensive action plan.As per the PMC’s proposal, the consultant will base the study on factors such as the existing situation analysis, demography, transport, parking, street network, urban block and non-motorized transport.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73261859,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-692096,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-to-assess-impact-of-additional-fsi-for-metro/articleshow/73257526.cms

Meerut: Days after two sisters riding a scooter were crushed to death by a truck while on way to school, a magisterial probe has been set up in the matter.

The accident took place near Kankarkhera flyover on December 9 when the truck rammed their two-wheeler. The truck had allegedly entered a no-entry area in Meerut Cantt in order to avoid paying entry charge. Both sisters, who were not wearing a helmet, sustained head injuries and died on the spot.

Ajay Kumar Tiwari, Meerut additional district magistrate (city), said, “Meerut district magistrate has set up a magisterial probe into the death of two sisters who died in an accident after a truck allegedly entered a no-entry zone in Meerut Cantt to save on entry charge on December 9. If anybody has any written or verbal statement or evidence to give in the matter, he/she can approach us between January 14 and January 20 to help in a fair probe.”

The victims, Annu Kumari (16) and Anjali (12), were students of Army Public School and City Vocational Public School, respectively.

TOI had earlier reported that Annu Kumari was driving the scooter with Anjali on the pillion. A truck rammed into their two-wheeler and smashed their heads. Locals gathered at the spot and alerted police.

This comes at a time when a tiff is on between transporters and the Meerut Cantonment Board over entry charge at three new spots in the district. While the entry charge was stopped by the Cantt authorities, the contractor in question started levying a charge again starting January 8, citing a stay on Cantt order by Allahabad High Court.

On the day of the accident, the Cantt authorities had given a green signal for collecting entry charge to gather funds for maintenance activities. The instruction to levy a fee was given by the Cantt board on December 8. However, after protests, the board authorities withdrew its order on December 12 and cancelled the contract with the contractor. Later, the contractor approached the Allahabad High Court for relief and obtained a stay on the Cantt board order.

They alleged that Naik was abusing his power and using the police force to settle personal grudges.

President of the Mahila Morcha Congress, Pratima Coutinho said that police are paid from tax payers’ money and as such should work to safeguard the public and not the minister who will not permanently hold the position.

Bijnor: Preparations for Ganga Yatra, which will be flagged-off by UP CM Yogi Adityanath on January 27 from Bijnor’s Sabalgarh village, are on in full swing. The Yatra, whose aim is to sensitise villagers along the banks of the river about plastic pollution and cleanliness, was to be flagged-off on January 1, but got delayed by anti-CAA protests that rocked the state.

The CM will address a public meeting at Meerut ’s Hastinapur, spend a night here and set off for Garhmukteshwar on January 28.

According to officials, Ganga has been included in the list of the world’s top 10 most polluted rivers. The biggest sources of its pollution are sewage, plastic/polythene, garbage, defecation and industrial effluents. Lack of proper management of cremation and wharfs in rural areas, and lack of awareness among villagers, are considered other big causes of pollution.

UP has been declared “open defecation free”. A campaign to make the state polythene free is going on. In addition, several programmes, including management of solid and liquid waste, are being run under Swachh Bharat Mission.

Bijnor district magistrate Ramakant Pandey said, “Ganga Yatra will be held between January 27-31. It’s aimed at raising awareness about the importance of cleanliness and river Ganga in our lives. The river, which enters UP at Bijnor’s Sabalgarh village on the Uttrakhand border, passes through 26 districts in the state.”

Meerut’s administration is leaving no stone unturned to make the CM’s programme a success. District magistrate Anil Dhingra said, “CM Yogi Adityanath will inaugurate the Yatra on January 27 at Sabalgarh village. It will pass through 26 districts covering 21 civic bodies and 1,026 village panchayats, and end on January 31 at Kanpur, where PM Narendra Modi could join.”

“From Bijnor, the Yatra will reach Hastinapur where the CM will address the public at Government Inter College, spend the night here and depart for Brajghat,” Dhingra added.

Nagpur: A day after TOI report, the state industries, energy and labour department (Nagpur section) lifts inspector on Tuesday found brazen violations of norms at the Empress Mall where 15 people were stuck in a lift late on Saturday evening.

Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) fire and emergency services personnel too conducted a separate inspection of the mall lifts the same day. The lifts inspector found the mandatory annual maintenance contract (AMC) of eight lifts had not been renewed. The overload sensor was also not working in the lift involved in the incident. A show cause notice will be served on mall management on Wednesday.

Acting chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake said the report was yet to be finalized but his team too found problems in functioning of the lifts.

On January 14, TOI had reported how 13 moviegoers and two salespersons were stuck in the mall lift on fourth floor following a malfunction on January 11. The 13 occupants had gone for a movie at PVR Cinemas while the salesperson were returning home from third floor when the lift unexpectedly went to the upper floor and got stuck for over 30 minutes.

Speaking from his Mumbai office, assistant electrical inspector (lifts) Uday Dambhe said the inspection team confirmed the incident took place at 10.30pm. “I will be inspecting the mall lifts in the next couple of days. The AMC lapsed in February last year. After this, the mall owner signed up a local contractor who too left midway. I have informed the lift company and asked them to come during my visit,” he said.

Lawyer Ankita Shah said the electrical inspector needed to comply with the stringent provisions of Sections 17, 19, 22 and 24 of the Maharashtra Lifts, Escalator and Moving Walks Act 2017. “These powers need to be exercised to prevent tragedies,” she said.

Dambhe said as per Sec 22, decision to seal the lift can be taken only if owner failed to reply to show cause notice, the third party insurance as per Sec 23 is yet to be implemented while suspension of licence as per Sec 19 can’t be done until an inquiry is completed.

Pune: An evening stroll on Parvati hill on his day off turned horrific for Manoj Bahutule (35), a salesman with a garment shop, on Monday. An armed robber brutally assaulted him when he resisted him and fled with his cellphone as well as cash, collectively worth Rs7,200.

With the robber assaulting him with the butt of a knife, Bahutule suffered a cut on his chin and lost three teeth. The victim also suffered fractures to his left wrist and left leg in the sustained assault.

After preliminary treatment, Bahutule lodged an FIR against the robber. The police have registered an offence under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.

Sub-inspector K D Sankpal of the Dattawadi police station said Bahutule was a resident of Janata Vasahat and worked as the salesman in a garment shop. Since Monday was his weekly off, he had gone for stroll on the Parvati hill in the evening. “After reaching the top, Bahutule decided to sit on a wall located along the route towards Kartik Swami temple,” Sankpal said.

The officer said around 4pm an unidentified man appeared in front of Bahutule from the forest and threatened him with a sharp knife. When the man tried to snatch Bahutule’s mobile phone, the latter resisted. “The suspect all of a sudden assaulted Bahutule on his face. While attempting to dodge the blow, Bahutule received a cut on his chin,” Sankpal said.

The suspect then began hitting him on his mouth with the knife’s butt. Due to the sustained assault, Bahutule lost three teeth. As the assault continued, Bahutule raised an alarm. However, at the time, there was hardly anyone on Parvati hill. “Security guards of the Parvati temple heard the screams and ran towards the wall. Seeing the guards, the suspect snatched Bahutule’s cellphone and his wallet containing Rs200 before disappearing into the forest,” Sankpal said.

The guards immediately alerted the police. When the police team reached the spot, they found that Bahutule was in a bad condition. He was bleeding from his mouth and was also unable to move his hands and legs. “Our team brought him down the hill and sent him to the hospital. He is out of danger,” Sankpal said.

The officer stated that the police had launched a search for the suspect. “We have carried out searches in the slums located on the foothills. Our investigation is under way,” Sankpal said.

Nagpur: Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Tuesday issued contempt notices to three senior secretaries of the Maharashtra government over failure to upgrade Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital and Research Centre.

A division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Atul Chandurkar directed the respondents — Urban development secretary Manisha Mhaiskar, revenue secretary Manu Srivastava and medical education and research secretary Sanjay Deshmukh — to reply before March 11.

Petitioner Kunal, son of energy minister Nitin Raut, through counsel Rohan Chabra accused all three senior officials of wilfully disobeying the court’s orders while hearing a PIL No 96/2016 on December 31, 2018. The HC had ordered to upgrade the hospital within four months, but nothing progressed for over a year.

According to Chabra, North Nagpur is underdeveloped and backward area and there is need of better health care facilities for the residents there. He contended that the free land of 14,528 sq mtr is available for the upgradation and new construction, but the respondents were ignoring the HC’s orders.

During the Congress-NCP government, a cabinet note was released on February 25, 2014, in this regard and later a Government resolution (GR) was issued March 4 in same year for upgradation of the hospital.

The JNU administration claimed the classes for the new semester had started at many schools.

NEW DELHI: In a hardening of its stand, Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union ( JNUSU ) said on Tuesday that normal academic activities couldn’t resume on the campus till vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar was removed.

“We will ensure that the main culprit behind ‘JNU terror attack’ on January 5, Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar, is removed as the vice-chancellor at the earliest. JNUSU, along with JNUTA, reiterate the position that there cannot be normal academic activities until the VC is removed,” JNUSU said in a statement.

Despite Union human resource development (HRD) minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ having said on Monday that the agitation was no longer justified as the fee demand had been met, JNUSU claimed success in suspending academic activities and boycotting the registration process. It also reiterated its key demands — complete rollback of the Inter-Hall Administration (IHA) manual, no punitive action against protesting students and holding an IHA meeting in a democratic manner with JNUSU in attendance.

The union called Pokhriyal’s support for the VC shameful and condemnable. “It just goes to show the complete support of the BJP government in the VC’s agenda to destroy JNU. As MHRD has ended the dialogue with JNUSU, it is clear that the government has completely sided with the JNU administration” JNUSU alleged, adding that the administration has neither provided a buffer period for exams nor withdrawn the proctor inquiries but the government has turned a blind eye to this behaviour.

Meanwhile, the administration claimed the classes for the new semester had started in many schools and centres and the timetable for more classes had been notified. Similarly, the MPhil/PhD viva-voce examination of various research scholars have been conducted, it added. On Tuesday, general body meetings (GBMs) were held at different centres to decide their stand on the registration.

JNUSU has called a council meeting on Wednesday. According to the statement, it is exploring “constitutional avenues” to fight the IHA manual and “has been in dialogue with the student faculty committee, hostel presidents and various organisations. We want to inform the students’ community that our struggle against the illegal IHA manual has entered its decisive phase as even the brutal state-sponsored violence has not dampened the spirit of resistance”.

Representative image

PANAJI: The National Green Tribunal ( NGT ), New Delhi, has directed the governments of various state and Union territories to fill the gaps in information pertaining to solid waste management , sewage treatment and air pollution that has been submitted to it.

The bench issued the order recently after the matter was put up before it seeking that reports of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) be considered in pursuance of the NGT’s September 12, 2019 order on the status of compliance of waste management and other issues in different states and UTs.

The CPCB had filed its status report on December 27, 2019 and another one on January 6 this year on the three major issues of waste, sewage and air pollution.

Although states had furnished some information, the NGT said the nature and extent of the information did not match the requirement. It also noted that there were huge gaps in information about sewage generation and treatment.

The tribunal also found fault with the grading of states by the CPCB. “Grading made by the CPCB into ‘good’, ‘average’, ‘poor’ and ‘no information’ is not based on any qualitative analysis but on the extent of information furnished,” the order stated.

With regard to municipal solid waste, the NGT sought more information on the quantity generated, segregated and treated. Gaps in waste-processing in terms of generation and treatment, and enforcement of statutory timelines needed to be explained, it stated. It also sought an explanation over bridging the gap and number of sites, the quantity of legacy waste therein and timelines for remediation.

The NGT further sought clarity on the quantity of sewage generated and treated in each state, the gap in sewage treatment and timelines to bridge the gap, including strategy for the use of treated water for secondary purposes.

337,['15/01/2020'],Shinde wants April start to services on priority stretch,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Pune: State urban development minister Eknath Shinde on Tuesday told Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) to start Metro service for commuters by April.

At a meeting in Mumbai on Tuesday, Shinde told MahaMetro to complete trials on a 5km elevated portion by the end of March and start the service by April, officials said.

MahaMetro is conducted trials runs of two rakes on the “priority stretch” between the Sant Tukaramnagar and Phugewadi stations, which fall on Line 1 (PCMC-Swargate) of the Pune Metro project.

At the meeting, MahaMetro officials presented a progress report of the work in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. Shinde told them to give him timely updates.

Shinde also met officials from Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA), which has sought 4 TMC of water for the next 10 years. Shinde reportedly told PMRDA to furnish details of the various sources of water, which can supply the 7,000sqm region, considering that Khadakwasla dam supplies water to Pune. The minister told PMRDA commissioner Vikram Kumar and planner Vivek Kharwadkar to check the feasibility of sourcing water from the Mulshi Tata power dam.

Further, the minister told officials to speed up the land acquisition process for the first phase of the 128km ring road project.

On Friday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar will review the progress of all three Metro lines in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, while CM Uddhav Thackeray is expected to chair a PMRDA meeting this week, sources said.

Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will increase the remuneration of specialist doctors to encourage them to join the civic medical services.

As per the new package, these medical practitioners will get Rs 71,679 per month as against the earlier salary of Rs 52,000. Of the 124 posts for specialist doctors, only 22 have been filled so far.

“Finding medical practitioners for civic health services was difficult due to low financial returns offered to them. The civic administration will increase their remuneration now from Rs 52,000 per month to Rs 71,679. A proposal in this regard has been tabled and approved,” Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee of PMC, said.

The committee has also given green signal to appoint doctors on bond for the civic hospitals to tide over the vacancies. Once the approval for regular doctors comes from the state government, their services will be discontinued.

“Both these decisions will help in improving the civic medical services. The hospitals and medical facilities that remained unused due to manpower crunch can be utilised now,” Ramchandra Hankare, head of PMC’s health department, said.

PMC runs 49 out patient departments, 18 maternity hospitals, two mobile health centres each and one general hospital, among others.

A total of 216 health officers and resident doctors have been approved for these civic health facilities, of which 56 posts are still vacant. They will be filled with doctors who will sign the bonds. The civic administration will pay Rs 52,000 per month to these medical practitioners.

339,['15/01/2020'],"After dozen gold heists in 7 months, Meerut jewellers knock on ADG’s door, threaten to shut shop","This story is from January 15, 2020

Meerut: A day after major police reshuffle in the state which saw two police commissioners taking over Lucknow and Noida, a large number of bullion traders knocked on the doors of additional director general of police (law and order) Prashant Kumar on Tuesday. Unnerved by over a dozen cases of loot and theft in the city involving gold and silver worth crores in the past 7-8 months, the bullion traders threatened to down shutters if a special team was not formed to solve these cases.

Exactly a month ago, prominent city jeweller Akshay Jindal lost gold and diamond jewellery worth Rs 54 lakh to robbers who daringly looted his shop in broad daylight. In November, another jeweller Govind Agarwal was divested of gold worth Rs 10 lakh. In October, two daring loots of yellow metal worth Rs 22 lakh took place in the district while in July, Meerut-based National Institute of Jewellery Technology witnessed theft of costly gadgets worth Rs 23 lakh and the list goes on.

None of these cases of loot and thefts have been solved so far.

Unnerved by the never-ending crime scenario, a large number of bullion traders knocked the doors of ADG Police Meerut zone Prashant Kumar on Tuesday morning and threatened to close down their businesses if cases are not solved at the earliest after the constitution of a special crack team for the purpose.

With a daily earning of nearly Rs 10 crore, Meerut is the largest jewellery market in Uttar Pradesh and among the top ten in the country. Over 40,000 artisans and 2,000 jewellery shop owners in the city depend on the industry which, according to a conservative estimate, involves an annual turnover of Rs 2,000 crore.

According to Pradeep Kumar Agarwal, president, Meerut Bullion Traders’ Association, “The situation is alarming. Out of a dozen cases, seven cases are of thuggery, in which gang members came in police uniform and pressured the person carrying the jewellery consignment. We gave sketches of these men to the police several times. But the security agencies have failed to make a single arrest. We have demanded ADG Kumar to set up a five-member crack force to seriously look into the matter. Otherwise, we will be forced to shut our shops.”

ADG Prashant Kumar told TOI, “We are already on the trail of this gang. Once they are nabbed, half of the cases will be solved. Besides, we are quite close to cracking the latest robbery in a showroom that took place at Akshay Jindal’s shop. But I think jewellers should also take some precautions in not falling prey to these thugs, who are able to divert their attention easily.”

Nagpur: Protesters wound up their agitation against NRC-CAA at Samvidhan Chowk after four days as Leelatai Chitale, who took part in the Quit India movement, made a fiery speech on the last day.

“Not many would be knowing this but the colour green in the national flag represents Muslims of the country. This is because Muslims were in equal number in India those days. Hindus are represented by the saffron colour which also stands for the spirit of selflessness,” she said.

“Anyone who is son of the soil has an equal right to live in the country. Green also stands for nature and the government should not dare to go against nature,” she said.

Sounding loud and clear, the 89-year-old said she was 12 when she responded to Gandhi’s do or die call. “We were three girls who marched up to the Sitabai Arts College in Akola. The police detained us till the evening. On being released we got a rousing welcome. The courage instilled in the people by Gandhiji those days can be again seen now,” she said.

Chitale said her family faced tough times after her father, also a freedom fighter, lost his mental balance after coming out of jail. Later, her brother too was put under detention. “Those days it was difficult to make two ends meet. At that time, the Syed family of Borgaon Manju village in Akola came to our help. Even at that time there were people with a different mindset who objected to our taking help from them. But we could survive the crisis only because of the Syeds,” she said to a rousing applause.

Earlier, during the meet, Marathi writer Yeshwant Manohar hit out at RSS and the upper caste. “A Hindu rashtra means country of Brahmins and RSS where Manusmruti will be the law and women and lower caste will be slaves,” he said.

“You may be poor but Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar’s constitution gives you privilege of being the country’s citizens. I think it is beginning of the end of racism and I support you in the fight against it,” he said.

Social activist Rupa Kulkarni also toed the same line. “If they are accepting PAN cards for filing returns, why should they not treat it as a proof of citizenship too? If PAN is enough to pay your tax it should be so for citizenship also,” she said.

The four-day agitation was organized by an outfit — We the Citizens of India — formed during the anti-NRC-CAA protests. As the protests ended, calls were made to take part in another rally planned next week. On Wednesday, a group of students from Nagpur university are expected to hold protests at Samvidhan chowk.

342,['15/01/2020'],Seize WhatsApp group members’ phones: Delhi high court,"This story is from January 15, 2020

NEW DELHI: Members of two WhatsApp groups allegedly linked to the January 5 violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) must be summoned by police and their mobile phones seized “at the earliest,” Delhi high court said on Tuesday.

Justice Brijesh Sethi asked the police to act against members of the two suspected WhatsApp groups — Friends of RSS and Unity Against Left — after the social messaging service informed the court that messages and chats are end-to-end encrypted and not stored on its servers. It claimed that the chats would only be available on the recipient and sender’s phones. “It works on end-to-end encryption and the only way to access and preserve it is by preserving the phone of those persons,” the global giant’s counsel told the court after it sought to know steps taken to preserve the conversations in the two groups under scanner, as sought by the petitioners — three professors of JNU.

The court further told JNU administration to preserve and provide CCTV footage that may have captured incidents of the violence for which police have already sent a request.

The directions came as the court was hearing a plea filed by the academics seeking to preserve CCTV footage and other evidence relating to the WhatsApp groups allegedly used in coordinating the attack inside campus.

Senior advocate Rebecca John, appearing for the petitioners, told the court that mobile phones of the members of these two groups are a primary evidence. Once police seize any phone, they can get basic information from WhatsApp.

During the hearing, Google informed the court that if the police provided it with the user information, including email IDs, of the members of the two WhatsApp groups it could verify if any chat histories were backed up on Google Drive. That may be then shared. It told the court that the search engine will “protect whatever is there on our system as on date.”

On its part, Delhi Police told the court that it had identified 37 persons who were part of the two groups, and notices were sent to them to appear before it. But no phones have been confiscated or examined, it added.

After hearing all the parties, the high court issued various directions and disposed of the petition which had sought directions for preservation and retrieval of all materials and evidence available with WhatsApp, Google and Apple pertaining to relevant data of the two WhatsApp groups, including messages, pictures and videos and phone numbers of the members, related to JNU violence.

Pune: A 58-year-old architect from Andheri (West) in Mumbai was killed on Tuesday morning when an unidentified vehicle rammed his car from the rear after he stopped his four-wheeler in the shoulder lane of the Mumbai-bound corridor of expressway amid low visibility and came out of it.

The accident occurred near Devale bridge between Malavli and Lonavla, about 50km away from the city, around 7am. Police said the victim, Aziz Abbas Kachwalla, was proceeding towards Mumbai from Pune. He had stopped in the shoulder lane of the Pune-Mumbai expressway probably to relieve himself.

The Lonavla rural police’s investigating officer Ajit Nanaware said, “Kachwalla got down from his white Fiat Punto car and walked to the rear of the vehicle. He suddenly found himself stuck between his car and the speeding vehicle that came from the rear and crashed into his four-wheeler.”

He said, “The accident may have occurred because of low visibility caused by foggy morning conditions. The vehicle coming from the rear may not have spotted the white car in the shoulder lane in time. The unidentified vehicle’s driver did not stop at the site nor did he/she make any calls to the expressway emergency control room. Going by the circumstances at the site and the impact of the crash, we suspect that the offending vehicle might be a truck or a bus.”

The police said, “After hitting the car, the unidentified vehicle dragged it for almost 25 metres with the victim stuck in between. It then swept aside the car to the extreme right side of the eway lane near the median. The victim died on the spot.”

Nanaware said, “Kachwalla was in Pune on Monday for visiting his mother, who stays at Kalyaninagar. He also has a bungalow at Khandala. After spending a day with his mother, he had left for Mumbai early in the morning on Tuesday.”

The Lonavla rural police have filed a case of rash and negligent driving causing death, against the unidentified four-wheeler driver.

344,['15/01/2020'],Morning haze to continue as moisture incursion prevails,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Pune: Constant moisture in the air has pushed up occurrences of fog and haze in the city this winter.

As per India Meteorological Department (IMD), haze caused visibility in Shivajinagar to drop to 4km on Tuesday morning, which means that objects were not visible beyond the 4km radius due to the obscurity in the air. The visibility in Lohegaon was even less, plunging to 2km.

IMD officials said though there wasn’t data available on the frequency of haze and fog instances this winter, they seem to have gone up in Pune due to constant moisture presence in the air.

In meteorological glossary, fog is defined as ‘obscurity in the surface layers of the atmosphere, which is caused by a suspension of water droplets’. Haze is a suspension of extremely small, dry particles in the air, not only water droplets.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune, told TOI, “The interaction between the moist southwesterly/ westerly breeze from the Arabian Sea and southerly/ southeasterly winds, the upper air cyclonic circulation over north Madhya Maharashtra are causing moisture incursion. This will further increase haze formation chances over Pune from January 15,” he added.

345,['15/01/2020'],GREEN VICTORY: NO ROAD VIA BHARAT VAN,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Nagpur: With the Nagpur Municipal Corporation all set to refuse permission for cutting and transplantation of trees, the MahaMetro and Public Works Department has decided to drop the proposed road through Bharat Van as well as the alternative one through Ravi Nagar government quarters. This is a major victory for the greens who were fighting against the construction of the road through a thriving bio-diversity area.

In a letter to PWD on September 13, 2019, Metro has also stated that the plan for the tunnel road and viewing gallery at Futala Lake has been changed. “Now, there is no necessity for an alternative road from Amravati Road to Telangkhedi Hanuman Mandir via Bharat Nagar,” the letter stated.

TOI has also repeatedly written how Metro’s transplantation efforts have failed miserably even after using the services of experts and spending lakhs of money.

Originally, the viewing gallery was to occupy the entire Futala waterfront. It is now been reduced to half. A new permanent road is also being constructed in the area where the demolished eateries once stood.

NMC sources told TOI that municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar discussed reports submitted by all agencies in the meeting held on Tuesday and directed NMC, PWD and MahaMetro to keep on hold the proposed roads. “MahaMetro officials informed that road in front of Futala lake was to be blocked for traffic for construction due to which an alternate road was proposed through Bharat Van. Now that the plan has changed, there is no need for a new road,” sources said.

The road through Bharat Nagar will however continue to remain as part of the development plan (DP). West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre had assured residents that it will be deleted.

NMC sources added that the Tree Authority headed by municipal commissioner Bangar will now procedurally reject the application of MahaMetro seeking transplantation of the 558 trees in Bharat Van. “Tree Authority, NMC, PWD and MahaMetro will submit similar affidavits before the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court informing it about Tuesday’s decision. The next hearing of the suo motu PIL is slated for January 29,” sources said.

Sources also added that the decision to drop the road “is not a sudden one but an outcome of various deliberations”. “In the last meeting held with MP Nitin Gadkari at Vanamati, it was decided that alternate options would be explored. Simultaneously, a thought came forward that the gallery’s design should be modified to avoid road blockage. That’s how things started unfolding,” said sources.

TOI was the first to report on October 27, 2018, about the proposal to construct the road cutting down 588 trees, displacing different species of birds and also monkeys. Honorary wildlife warden Jaydeep Das wrote a letter to HC seeking its intervention in saving the mini forest. He wrote that road was being planned without any traffic and environmental assessment.

The HC treated Das’ letter as a suo motu PIL on December 3, 2018 and also imposed a stay on the cutting of trees.

After activists and residents of various parts of West Nagpur including Bharat Nagar protested, Gadkari, who had sanctioned funds for the proposed road, directed the NMC to find an alternative one.

This other choice was to cut through two playgrounds in Ravi Nagar government quarters. Residents of the area were opposed to this too.

Thakre also held a meeting with PWD engineers, talked to NMC officials and directed to drop all proposed roads. NMC sources said Thakre also took up this issue with PWD minister Ashok Chavan recently.

The state PWD conducted a Origin-Destination Traffic Survey and stressed on the need for a road through Bharat Van. MahaMetro inspected the alternative through Ravi Nagar and apprised NMC about the problems.

The MahaMetro had earlier denied that the road through Bharat Van was an alternate for closing the road in front of Futala lake. It had said that the proposed road was the main project and Futala lake works were ancillary.

A MahaMetro official told TOI on Tuesday that it “was an executing agency and will implement the project as per decisions of PWD”. “It is not our project but planned and sanctioned by PWD,” he said.

Thakre said no project can be executed unless it is beneficial for the people. “Everyone were opposed to the proposed roads. I will ensure that it is deleted from the DP. I will also take efforts to ensure that the Bharat Van is reserved as green zone,” he said.

346,['15/01/2020'],Kirloskar Brothers Limited celebrates Laxmanrao’s legacy,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Laxmanrao Kirloskar’s many innovations on display at KBL’s office in Baner.

PUNE: The foundation for the 100-year-old Pune-based Kirloskar Brothers Limited (KBL) was laid when Laxmanrao Kirloskar started a bicycle trading company with his brother in 1888. Years later, he moved to Belgaum to pursue his dream of manufacturing things that could find a market in India.

When he moved to the countryside, he became transfixed with the idea of making iron ploughs, as he thought they would find a market among the agrarian population, which then comprised 80% of the people in India. A voracious reader, Laxmanrao studied catalogues and American magazines — like the ‘Foundry’ — to learn to make good ploughs. In early 20th century, his efforts bore fruit and he brought out six ploughs, only to realize that there was no market for them.

“It took him two years to sell the first six ploughs — a progressive farmer from Karad bought them. The company hasn’t looked back since,” says Sanjay Kirloskar, Laxmanrao’s great grandson and KBL managing director.

As KBL marks the 100th year of the inception of its registered office in Kirloskarwadi, it also celebrates Laxmanrao’s liberal thinking which made it possible for the township to be built from scratch.

“What I found great about him was that when he had to leave Belgaum, he could bring 32 families with him to a place that had nothing. They constructed this township. He was neither particularly religious nor a believer in rituals or superstitions. It did not matter to him that people who came with him were from different backgrounds, castes and religions — that was how Kirloskarwadi grew,” says Sanjay.

Laxmanrao’s many innovations still find a place of pride in KBL’s ground floor headquarters in Baner, many dating back to Kirloskar Group ’s efforts to industrialize India, at a time when the Freedom Movement was gaining momentum.

Such is the goodwill that Laxmanrao had earned over the years that many erstwhile employees and acquaintances have offered to help the group for free to manage events that the company wishes to undertake in his name.

“All the time, Laxmanrao was thought about work — he hardly gave himself time for relaxing, entertainment, holiday tours or even family. He sacrificed everything for India’s industrial independence — he was working when his son got married, and was doing social work when his wife passed away,” says B V Chaukulkar, who was born in Kirloskarwadi and spent time with Laxmanrao from 1940-46.

The family has kept in touch with the families all those who had supported Laxmanrao’s enterprise at the time. In 2019, the newer generations of those families flew in from different parts of the world to celebrate Laxmanrao’s sesquicentenary.

Representative image

PATNA: A 13-year-old girl from Katihar , who was kidnapped while returning home from school more than a month ago, was rescued from Siliguri in West Bengal on Monday by her parents with the help of Bihar Police .

“The girl was kidnapped by Lakhman Paswan and his associates in the last week of November while she was returning from her school,” Katihar’s Sahayak police station SHO Rajesh Kumar said, adding, “Paswan took her to Siliguri where he works at a tea manufacturing company and raped her.”

In her police complaint, the girl alleged that she was raped by Paswan, a father of three, in his rented accommodation soon after they landed at Siliguri. When she complained to his wife Munni Devi, she allegedly threatened her and told her to follow her husband’s diktat.

According to the complaint, the minor overheard a conversation between Paswan and his wife about selling the minor to pimp in a red light area. Frightened, she narrated her tale to a sympathetic neighbour.

“The neighbour took pity on her and somehow contacted her parents in Katihar over phone and disclosed about the place where she was held captive,” said an investigating officer, quoting the victim.

Paswan (40) and his wife Muni Devi (35) have been booked under Section 366A of IPC and POCSO Act 2012. “Other sections will be added after receipt of the victim’s medical report,” the SHO added.

Katihar SP Vikas Kumar said, “The girl comes from a poor family and her neighbour took advantage of the family’s economic condition. The couple’s links with those involved in human trafficking in Siliguri are being verified. Our first priority was to get the victim released safe and sound.”

Since the police were made aware that Paswan was trying to sell her off, the Katihar police exerted pressure on his relatives in Katihar. “Going to Siliguri would have taken time so we exerted pressure on Lakshman’s relatives in Katihar to hand over the girl to her parents. And the girl was let off near the ‘hawai adda’ under the Katihar Sahayak police station on Monday evening from where she was brought to the police station,” said a police officer.

“We will now send a police team to Siliguri to trace the place where the girl was kept in illegal confinement and subjected to sexual abuse. A woman police officer has been entrusted with the task of counselling the victim on a regular basis,” the SP said.

The minor was produced at the Katihar civil court on Tuesday and sent to the local sadar hospital for medical examination. The medical report is awaited.

Though the Sahayak SHO denied that any missing complaint was lodged, the girl’s father claimed that he had filed a complaint petition to the local police but nobody cared. “Thane wale bole ki pata lagao (cops asked me to search her myself),” the girl’s father said.

349,['15/01/2020'],"To save money on rent, govt may shift some offices to IGC","This story is from January 15, 2020

Amaravati: In a move that could lighten the burden on the exchequer, the state government is mulling the shift of many government offices, such as commissionerates and directorates, that are operating from offices taken on rent in Vijayawada and Guntur cities to the Interim Government Complex (IGC) in Velagapudi.

The IGC, which houses the secretariat, is likely to be unoccupied once the government clears the decks for the relocation of the executive capital city in Visakhapatnam. In fact, shifting of head of the departments (HoDs) to Velagapudi will show the local residents that the government will not ignore Amaravati.

Sources said shifting the commissionerates and directorates to Velagapudi would also help counter the criticism that the buildings constructed with public money would go waste.

“The proposal is only in the initial discussions. It needs further fine-tuning,” said a senior official privy to the development.

IGC has six blocks with G+1 structure. While assembly and council are located in one block, another block is dedicated to the CMO. The chambers of cabinet ministers and about 33 departments are housed in the remaining four blocks. Since Amaravati is likely to continue as legislative capital, the government might keep the assembly and CMO blocks available for future requirements. In such a case, about four lakh square foot of space would be available in the remaining four blocks in IGC as each block measures one lakh sqft. Since many of the HoDs are housed in offices, which are about 20,000-30,000 sqft, and located in remote locations in different parts of Vijayawada and Guntur cities, shifting a few of the offices to Velagapudi would have dual benefit. First the staff will no longer have to work from insufficient space and the government can save money on the rent.

For instance, some of the senior officials have offices, which are about 1 lakh sqft, and they pay a monthly rent of Rs 30-Rs 40 lakh. Besides, the commissioners and directors have spent a large amount of money on doing up the interiors. The then managing director of APMDC had reportedly spent a fortune to make the install central air-conditioning in the office, despite knowing that it was a private property.

The state government is spending nearly Rs 80-Rs 90 crore on annual rent for the private space, which means the state government has already spent close to Rs 250-Rs 300 crore exclusively on rents. These offices were hurriedly shifted to Amaravati from Hyderabad without proper planning and facility. Private buildings located in Gollapudi to Gannavaram in Vijayawada and Tadepalle to Syamalanagar in Guntur city were taken on lease. There were allegations that many of the buildings were taken on lease in remote areas due to pressure from the then ministers and TDP functionaries. “We could have constructed permanent buildings with these amount had the previous government not moved all the offices from Hyderabad to Amaravati region without planning,” commented a senior official.

The seized handcarts in a Pune Cantonment Board-owned vehicle.

PUNE: A special squad of the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) removed over 200 hawkers on MG Road and its surrounding areas during anti-encroachment drives over the past 12 days.

The squad led by PCB’s deputy executive officer Rahul Gajbaye fined over 200 hawkers and confiscated around 150 handcarts during the drives. With the previous efforts of the PCB to curb illegal encroachments within the cantonment limits having come unstuck, the board officials said they would conduct regular and prolonged drives till the desired results were achieved. “We would continue our endeavour,” Gajbaye said.

The board had received several complaints from residents and Army officers regarding encroachments on public pavements, particularly on MG Road and East Street. “Either side of MG Road and East Street is reserved for parking. So, there is limited carriageway available for vehicular movement. With illegal vendors hijacking most of the pavement, commuters and pedestrians hardly get any space. We want to change this scenario,” Amit Kumar, chief executive officer of the PCB, told TOI.

Kumar said the PCB had carried out similar drives in the past, but they were not effective as hawkers would return in a few days. “This sort of prolonged campaign will send a stern message to the encroachers. The drives would be done on a regular basis in the future too,” he said.

The PCB has also decided to act against the traders encouraging encroachments by allowing hawkers to operate in front of their shops on the busy roads in the Cantonment area.

A section of the board officials said some of the hawkers had support from some of the board members. “Some members had approached the board authorities to return the seized materials. This needs to be stopped,” a senior official said.

351,['15/01/2020'],BBMP washes its hands of 4 multilevel car parking projects,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Representative image

BENGALURU: Almost 12 years after 10 multilevel car parking (MLCP) projects were proposed for the city and several reiterations of budgetary allocations were made for four, BBMP has washed its hands of them citing lack of space.

The four locations shortlisted for MLCP were opposite Sukh Sagar Hotel in Gandhinagar, Gandhi Bazaar , opposite Hosmat Hospital on Magrath Road and on the BBMP office premises near NR Square.

“Major exercises were conducted by the Palike to undertake the projects. Many working hours were spent to prepare detailed project reports, drawings and documents. Sadly, the projects have been found to be unviable. We have almost wasted a decade on them without getting any results,” a BBMP official said.

On record, though, BBMP says the projects have only been handed over to Bengaluru Smart City ( BenSCL ), which will take them up under central grants. “We have not given up on any MLCP. Some of them are being taken up under Smart City,” BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar asserted.

BenSCL too has not responded positively to the civic agency’s proposal. “Just like the Palike, even we have checked the project’s feasibility. There is no space. How can we go ahead with MLCP projects,” wondered a BenSCL official.

Besides, BenSCL’s resources are stretched. Of the Rs 1,000 crore funds in its kitty, it’s spending Rs 500 crore on road infrastructure and has several other projects in the pipeline. Sources said they want to take up the projects under public-private partnership but private parties are not showing any interest.

The urban land transport department in its parking policy prepared in 2008 had recommended MLCP projects at 10 locations — the existing flower market in Gandhi Bazaar; opposite Sukh Sagar Hotel in Gandhinagar; old Central Jail complex (Freedom Park); opposite Russell Market; SP Road behind LIC Building; opposite Surana College, Kengeri; opposite football stadium, Richmond Town; next to Ambedkar College, Outer Ring Road, Nagarbhavi; opposite RTO office, Yelahanka and Sant Maidan, Yelahanka to accommodate 3,055 cars and 1,400 two-wheelers. Barring the one at Freedom Park , not a single project has taken off.

352,['15/01/2020'],Shivaji Maharaj’s name used for pol gains: Udayanraje,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Former MP Udayanraje Bhosale

Pune: Udayanraje Bhosale, the 13th descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, on Tuesday condemned the publication of a book authored by BJP member Jay Bhagwan Goyal calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a modern day Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. He said political parties were using the Maratha king’s name for gains.

Senior Shiv Sena functionary Sanjay Raut on Monday had asked the warrior king's descendants to clarify their stand over the issue. Without taking any names, Raut had targeted BJP's Rajya Sabha member Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje and former Satara MP Udayanraje Bhosale who are from his lineage.

Udayanraje, without naming NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who is often referred to as “Janata Raja” (a wise and aware king) in political circles, said Shivaji Maharaj is the only one who can be called “Janata Raja”.

He challenged the Shiv Sena to rename itself as “Thackeray Sena” and remove Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s reference.

The former Satara MP, who had switched over to the BJP from the NCP ahead of the state assembly polls, said he felt dejected about the release of the controversial book.

“I have not read it. But what I have heard from the people and from the social media… Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj cannot be compared to like this. No one can reach his stature. He always thought of the people and followed “sarvadharma samabhav” (equality to all religions) secularism and social harmony. We can always follow his thoughts but we can never be Shivaji Maharaj,” he said.

He targeted the Shiv Sena for using Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s name. “How can a vada paav be named as Shiv vada? Why Maha-Shiv-Aghadi which was then renamed Maha-Vikas-Aghadi? Why is Shivaji Maharaj’s name being included in the party’s name? Instead, make it Thackeray Sena. If you want to use his name, then implement his thoughts. Citizens of the state are facing immense problems. Farmers are in distress. Those leading the state should work on these issues instead of taking mileage from Shivaji Maharaj’s name,” Bhosale said.

Bhosale wanted to understand why Shiv Jayanti was celebrated on three different days in the state. “A single date can be fixed to avoid politics over the days,” he added.

The Congress and NCP have demanded the book’s immediate withdrawal.

353,['15/01/2020'],"Lungs of Nagpur saved, say elated green activists","This story is from January 15, 2020

Nagpur: The collective decision of the authorities to make way for public demand by not making the road through Bharat Van is a big win for thousands of citizens, who stood hand-in-hand at Futala lake stretch on May 1 to save the urban jungle.

Since more than a year, citizens have been protesting to save one of the last biodiversity hotspots of the city — a lush green patch of land owned by Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PDKV), which was to be sacrificed for the proposed road.

Appreciative of the move taken by the civic agencies, greens welcome the development but with a word of caution. Honorary wildlife warden of Nagpur Jaydeep Das, whose letter highlighting the dangerous impact of the road was treated as a suo motu PIL by the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court, said, “The authorities realizing that transplantation of trees is a big failure is a very positive step. However, this road should be deleted permanently from the city’s development plan as in future, some other agency might want to build it.”

Adding that environment has come out to be the big winner in the Bharat Van case, Das demanded that environment impact assessment and structural audit should be done for the redevelopment of Futala case. “Rather than gaining commercial benefits at the cost of heritage and environment, authorities should now start being more considerate,” he said.

Celebrating the decision which saves the “lungs of Nagpur”, founder of Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee said, “It has been proved that public say matters. The final decision is in the hands of tree authority and we hope that the agencies stick to its decision.”

The authorities have accepted peoples’ verdict, stated Anasuya Chhabrani of NGO Swachh Association. “We are thankful to all the government agencies and politicians who supported citizens’ demand. To ensure sustainable development, this and other such roads threatening green cover should be immediately removed from the development plans. With changing times, the government needs to be receptive to alterations,” she added.

President of NGO Paryavaran Prerna Sharad Paliwal agreed. “It is good that the authorities realized the drastic consequences of constructing the road. Now, it should immediately inform the high court about its final decision so that the case can be disposed off,” he said.

In May last year, Paliwal had filed an intervention in the ongoing case highlighting that the proposed road construction cannot be looked in isolation while considering environmental impacts. “The area is home to around 140 bird species and other animals which will get adversely affected by the road,” his affidavit stated.

Kozhikode: City corporation will write a letter to the chairman of Railway board and police department to curb the transportation of rotten chicken meat via trains to be supplied to various food chain outlets in the corporation limits.

This was announced by mayor Thottathil Raveendran at the corporation council meeting held on Tuesday.

He said the letter will be submitted to avert similar incidents in the future. A reply in this regard was given when two councillors moved a joint adjournment motion in this regard. The adjournment motion was moved in the council following the seizure of 600kg of rotten chicken meat from Kozhikode railway station that arrived from Nizamuddin on Mangala Express train on January 9.

Inviting the attention of mayor, K M Rafeeq of CPM urged the mayor to put in place an effective mechanism to curb the supply of meat from outside the state via trains.

Councillor Sayed Mohammed Shameel said that formalin-laced fish and meat are being supplied to various hotels via train and buses. He urged the mayor to strengthen vigil and conduct inspections covering all types of food chain outlets comprising hotels, bakeries, makeshift eatery outlets making use of such meat items for the preparation of shawarma and snack items. Corporation health standing committee chairman K V Baburaj said that civic body has already taken steps to curb the supply of inconsumable meat to eatery outlets which are harmful to health. The council also decided to strictly enforce the ban on all types of single-use plastic items in the corporation limits from January 15 onwards. Councillor C Abdurahiman of IUML urged the mayor to provide time for the execution of a ban on the single-use plastic items. He said the traders need time for the disposal of bulk quantity of plastic carry bags purchased by them.

Mayor replied that enough time was given to the traders for the disposal of the remaining stock of single-use plastic items and they must comply with the government order. He also urged the traders and shop owners to switch over to cloth and paper carry bags. Corporation secretary Binu Francis said that that all types of single-use plastic items have been banned on January 1 and the ban will be strictly enforced in the corporation limits from January 15. He said the ban will be imposed by three enforcement authorities of local self-government bodies, district administration, and the pollution control board. The corporation secretary informed the council that the civic body will impose a fine of Rs 10,000 against the violators in the initial phase. The fine will be increased to Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000 in case the officials detect the violations for the second and third time.

Aurangabad: The proposed 150 tonne-a-day waste management plant at Harsul dominated the standing committee meeting held at the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Tuesday.

While Shiv Sena members wanted the project to be given to the agency proposed by the administration, the members of BJP marked a strong protest against finalising the previous tender and sought a new tender.

Last year, the AMC had called a tender for the appointment of an agency to run the waste management facility at Harsul. Pune’s PH Jadhav made the lowest bid followed by Waluj’s Mayo Vessels. In September 2019, the standing committee, chaired by BJP’s Jaishree Kulkarni, rejected the tender four months after it was submitted. The committee had raised questions on the shortlisted agency’s efficiency.

On January 9, in a meeting held in the city, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had asked the AMC to expedite the establishment of the Harsul facility.

On Tuesday, Sena brought the old tender before the standing committee as a last-minute proposal. Sena’s Rajendra Janjal, Sachin Khaire and other members sought approval for the same agency the committee had earlier rejected. Janjal, who is also the deputy mayor, alleged that BJP’s decision to scrap the old tender is based on vested interests. In response, BJP’s Raju Shinde said that they (BJP) too were aware of Sena’s truth. However, BJP group leader Pramod Rathod had a different stand from his party members. He said the Harsul waste management facility was crucial and he would seek information on why the tender was not approved.

Gajanan Barwal, of Shahar Vikas Aghadi, also objected to the old tender.

Notably, Nandkishore Bhombe, the head of the AMC’s solid waste management cell, had skipped the meeting. Executive engineer Hemant Kolhe attended the meeting on his behalf. When asked about the previous record of the agency, Kolhe said he had no idea about it.

Meanwhile, Sena members have asked mayor Nandkumar Ghodele to bring the project before the general body for its approval. Ghodele said he would get the legalities checked by the legal advisor to see if the GB can approve the agency.

Nashik: Toll plazas across Nashik from Wednesday would have only one lane for cash payment, while all other lanes will have electronic toll collection system through FASTags.

A senior National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) official said motorists who do not having FASTags but enter the electronic toll collection (ETC) lanes will have to pay double toll fees. “Even motorists who do not have sufficient balance in their account, will have to double toll fees,” he said.

“There was fear among people that double toll fee was being deducted from their bank account. Even if that was the case, the money would be transferred back into their account within two to three days,” he added.

Vehicle owners who are eligible for concession in toll fee like the ones staying within the 20-km radius of the toll plaza would have to visit the toll plaza and get their names and vehicles registered so that toll fee is not deducted from their account.

NHAI officials said that police bandobast will be maintained at all the toll plazas in the district to ensure that there is no law and order situation.

364,['15/01/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Tangedco may not get support of finance companies,"Representative image

CHENNAI: Even as Tangedco’s financial woes go from bad to worse, it has received a further shock with Union power minister R K Singh writing to chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and threatening to stop financial support to various thermal projects of the discom from Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) and Power Finance Corporation (PFC). The minister in a letter, a copy of which is available with TOI, has said that REC and PFC will be able to provide financial support only if Tangedco fulfills certain commitments.The letter was particularly critical about the delay by Tangedco in clearing payments to private power generators, besides not collecting its own dues from government departments. Following the letter, state power minister P Thangamani and TNEB chairman Vikram Kapur met Singh on Monday in New Delhi.“The distribution company, in the present circumstances, is not good credit risk and therefore the PFC and REC will find it difficult to extend further loans to it. The PFC and REC are financial institutions and they have to follow prudential norms,” Singh said in the letter. According to these norms, the distribution companies which have over-dues to generating companies and which are running losses do not qualify for lending. “This is a serious matter for the distribution company because PFC and REC are the major source for raising finances,” said the minister.The Tangedco website said a total of 5,700MW of thermal projects and 506.7MW of hydro power projects are dependent on finances from PFC and REC. As per the PRAAPTI (Payment Ratification and Analysis in Power procurement for bringing Transparency in invoicing of generators) website under the Union power ministry, Tangedco’s pending dues to various power generators, as on November 30, 2019, stood at Rs 11,728 crore.The minister attributed three factors for the discom’s troubles. “The non-payment of power dues by government departments is one major factor. The departments will need to pay every month for the electricity they consume. With power theft being another factor listed, the state government and discom will need to start taking stringent action to reduce theft and bring down the aggregate technical and commercial losses,” said Singh. He also referred to non-reimbursement or delayed reimbursement of subsidy provided to various category of consumers.Singh suggested a few areas to focus upon immediately to get REC and PFC to rethink on providing finance support to various power projects in the state. “The departments must clear their dues within three months and there must be a system wherein the departments pay their monthly power bill without any delay. One option is to install prepaid meters in all the departments as some states have done already,” said the minister.The minister also stressed on the need to have a strict system of energy accounting in place, as the core business of the discom is sale of electricity. “Power supplied to all categories of consumers must be strictly accounted for and the subsidy claims of the discom must be based on specific energy accounts with accurate metering. The subsidy must be paid to the discom every month,” said the minister.Efforts to get a reaction from Thangamani as well as Kapur proved futile. There was no response to calls, SMS and Whatsapp messages.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73261287,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-157876,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tangedco-may-not-get-support-of-finance-cos/articleshow/73258708.cms

JNU's gate on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has declared three suspects in the JNU violence case — Komal S, Rohit Shah and Akshat Awasthi — as absconders after they did not respond to the notices even on Tuesday. Police said they will now try to track down and arrest the three, all allegedly members of ABVP, and present them before the Special Investigation Team (SIT).

Police on Tuesday called Jawaharlal Nehru University students Sucheta Talukdar and Priya Ranjan Kumar, both from the Left-backed students’ groups, to appear before SIT. On Monday, notices were sent to Yogendra Bhadrwaj and Vikas Patel, both students belonging to ABVP.

At least two notices and a reminder were sent to the residences of the three suspects following a sting operation by a television channel, said a source. While Awasthi and Shah are students of JNU, Sharma is a DU student. A police team went to Awasthi’s home in Kanpur on Monday but he was not there.

Meanwhile, after SIT questioned four students, including JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh, about the violence on January 3 and 4, a forensic science laboratory (FSL) team spent the entire day on Tuesday in retrieving the CCTV footage from the server after the students claimed that it was functional even on January 5. Cops hope to retrieve some more CCTV footage. An FSL team will visit the university again on Wednesday to scan other areas, including ATMs.

A team from the cyber cell of Crime Branch also inspected the server room that was allegedly vandalised to prevent registration for the winter session.

It has been alleged that though the university authorities had restored the server temporarily, it was damaged again on January 4 by a group of students who entered the office through a rear door. The cyber cell team inspected the damage and will submit a report to the investigating team.

Some of the mobile phone footage submitted to police during the probe have also been sent for re-examination following the students’ stat0kements.

SIT has already opened a temporary office on the campus to record the statements of the 34 injured students.

366,['15/01/2020'],Won’t let stricter hospital rules be applied in Maharashtra: IMA,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Nagpur: Reasserting that stringent provisions and regulations in the new Clinical Establishment Act can shut down nearly 70% of small and medium clinics in state, the Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) state president Dr Avinash Bhondve said the doctors in Maharashtra won’t let the act to be implemented in its present draft form in the state.

“The entire draft has a series of rules which makes it impossible for single-doctor clinics and small nursing homes to follow. These establishments will lose their licence if this draft becomes an Act,” said Dr Bhondve.

Health is a state subject in the Constitution. As a result, the state is free to have its own Aact for medical establishments. Doctors are hopeful that the Maharashtra government would form its own law.

“The government under Devendra Fadnavis had agreed to amend the existing Bombay Nursing Home Establishment Act instead of implementing the new law. A drafting committee was also formed to suggest these amendments. We hope the present government also will follow the same path,” he said.

Dr Prakash Deo, who was one of the members of this drafting committee said they have drafted balanced regulations considering the needs of the state. “The draft of this Act presented by the central government is full of draconian laws. But at the state level, we considered views of all stakeholders and came up with a balanced document. As the draft is ready, it is for sure that central regulations will not be applied in Maharashtra,” he said.

State hospital board chairman Dr Mangesh Pate said the central draft has been made considering only corporate hospitals. “Doctors are not against regulations. But excessive and unnecessary regulations will hurt the entire health service scenario in Maharashtra. The central law has many provisions which may promote red tape and corruption,” he said.

For example, under the head of biomedical waste management, there is a one-line mention that doctors must follow Waste Management Rules, 2016. As per these rules, hospitals/clinics should have their own effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and sewage treatment plants (STPs). “Do you think a small ten-bedded hospital in a crowded localities can have its own STP?” Dr Pate asked.

IMA is also gearing up to start a nationwide agitation as the central government is yet to table the Doctors’ Protection Act, a central law to protect doctors from attacks.

367,['15/01/2020'],MERC withdraws compulsory gross metering for solar power,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Aurangabad: The Maharashtra Energy Regulatory Commission (MERC) has done away with the plan to have a compulsory gross metering for solar power generation.

The measure was one of the alleged provisions in the draft regulations that did not find any place in the final regulations declared by the regulatory body.

While the draft regulations had also envisaged an arrangement by which the power supplying companies were entitled to bill the power produced by solar users at allegedly higher rate, this too has been also made consumer-centric now.

TOI had reported the outrage on part of stakeholders about the draft rules. Maharashtra Solar Sanghthan, an umbrella organization of over 1,000 solar system manufacturers from Maharashtra, was up in arms against the MSEDCL over the draft regulations.

“It is a welcome move on part of MERC to do away the compulsory gross metering. The metering will be applicable to only those consumers who have captive generation of over 10 KW. By virtue of the new rules, around 85% small and medium solar power generators, including domestic users, will not fall in the purview of net metering,” Vipul Joisher, a senior functionary of Maharashtra Solar Sanghthan, said.

“We would like to see whether state power companies are ready to buy power from solar roof-top projects and pay for it in time,” he added.

Energy expert Hemant Kapadia of advocacy group Urja Manch said the final regulations in question are consumer-friendly as compared to what was proposed in the draft rules.

“We hope the new regulations will promote solar power generation, which is one of the objectives of the government. The regulator has more or less accepted all our demands, which will benefit the consumers,” he said.

Elaborating on some of the key changes in the policy governing the solar power generation, Kapadia said, “The MERC has increased the processing fees from Rs 1,000 to Rs 10,000. The expenditure on meters will be borne by the consumers and not by the state power utility. Also, consumers who are defaulters towards the payment of electricity bills, will be barred from net metering of solar power,” he said.

Notably, Maharashtra has a target of producing 11,926 MW of solar power by 2022 as part of renewable cumultative power target of 1,75,000 MW to be achieved the country.

Malappuram: Literature trains readers’ minds to be flexible , to understand different perspectives, to realize facts and to interact creatively while facing the complexities of life, said Omani writer and Man Booker International prize winner Jokha Alharthi.

She was delivering keynote address at an international academic conference on the topic ‘Applying Theory; Paradigms, Practices and Faultlines’ at Dr Gafoor Memorial MES college Mampad on Tuesday.

She said literature cannot be separated from thought, nor can it be separated from psychology, sociology, philosophy, history and other sciences. “Mark Twain notes that travel eliminates narrow-mindedness and intolerance, and this is applicable perfectly to the literature”, she said.

“In my last 20 years of studying and teaching literature, students have always confronted me with this question: What do we benefit from a poem or a novel? Does literature teach us? Yes of course. We may simply say that literature helps us understand the world. But, it is really more than that, it is the real field where various knowledge intersects and overlaps,” she said. She has pointed out that when Sigmund Freud wanted to name his psychological discoveries that were considered modern at that time, such as the complexity of the attachment of the son to the mother and the exclusion of the father, he did not find better than literature that draw from.

“If literature teaches us things related to the hidden aspects of the human soul, related to the complexity of human relationships, related to our deepest and most intuitive feelings, and things related to human life in times we have not witnessed, and places we have never trampled and teaches us the history that history’s official subjects do not teach and the history of human dreams, their torments and their desires, then why do we suspect for a moment that literature teaches us?” she said Literature must illuminate human existence. We want literature that doesn’t preach to us but rather teach us. One of the most important things it teaches us is to avoid superficiality and direct judgements, and to know that things are more complicated that they appear”, she said. TNN

Hyderabad: In as many as 84 wards in 35 municipalities, TRS candidates have won unanimously as no other nominations were received for the forthcoming municipal polls.

TRS secretary Gattu Ramachandra Rao and MLC Srinivas Reddy said at a press conference here on Tuesday that TRS had won in one division without any contest. Ramachandra Rao said as per their information, BJP did not get candidates to field in as many as 700 wards and Congress could not put up candidates in 400 wards.

“While Congress has no cadre, BJP has no support of voters,” he said. TRS alleged that in many places Congress and BJP were trying to work together clandestinely to hand their candidates the win.

Ramachandra Rao said this secret pact was evident in Karimnagar and Nizamabad. “At the national level, BJP and Congress are rivals but in Telangana they are friends,” he charged. The TRS leaders said the party would emerge victorious in the January 22 municipal elections.

Aurangabad: A workshop on violence against children and the first 1 ,000 days of child was organised by the Unicef through its implementing partner NGO Charkha in the city on Tuesday.

Pandurang Sudame, master trainer for infant and young child nutrition, Unicef, conducted a session on the first 1,000 days of child. Holding a doll in his hand, Sudame said, “This child cannot hold morchas or rasta rokos, neither does it have the right to vote. But it has four main demands — touch of mother and breastfeeding within five minutes of birth, only breast milk for the first six months, clean homemade food after six months and communication with the mother during feeding.”

Project leader at Charkha Alka Gadgil said that the brain of a child developed significantly in the first 1,000 days i.e. until it is two years old. If a child is given proper attention during this time, the country will have smarter children. “The care given to the child upto two years also impacts health indicators like infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate, besides determining the quality of athletes the country will have in future,” she said.

Gadgil also conducted a session on violence against children. She said that the violence could in an form—physical, psychological, sexual or economical. “Any kind of violence impacts the mindset of children, leading them to become insecure,” she said.

373,['15/01/2020'],Fadnavis’ assembly poll victory challenged in HC,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Nagpur: Advocate Satish Uke has again moved Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court against former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, this time challenging his victory in last year’s assembly polls from Nagpur Southwest constituency.

While praying to set aside the ex-CM’s candidature, the petitioner has also moved an application to delete names of other respondents by amending his petition.

A single-judge bench of justice Manish Pitale on Tuesday issued notice to Fadnavis, now leader of opposition in the assembly, asking him to reply before February 14. The judge also permitted petitioner to delete names in his plea.

Fadnavis had recently moved the Supreme Court to grant a stay on summons issued to him by the chief judicial magistrate here in the first case filed by Uke. The latter had accused Fadnavis of suppressing information about two police cases while filing his nomination forms in 2014 assembly polls.

Uke, who had earlier challenged Fadnavis’ last victory in 2014 from same constituency, claimed the latter allegedly indulged in corrupt practices, thereby vitiating the election. He informed that on October 6, 2019, he lodged a complaint with senior election officials against Fadnavis, his representative and mayor Sandip Joshi and collector-cum-returning officer, but nothing progressed.

Accusing the returning officer of improperly accepting Fadnavis’ nomination form, Uke claimed that he was present at the collectorate from 3pm to 5.45pm but the election officer didn’t allow him to access the ex-CM’s affidavit till 6pm. “Election officer and Joshi were trying to hide the CM’s affidavit for unknown reasons. On October 10, 2019, when all the candidates requested the returning officer to open sealed documents and access papers of all candidates, he again refused to do so on the directives of Fadnavis’ representatives. All of us were told to move the court if we wanted access to the papers,” he said.

The petitioner requested to cancel and recall the respondent’s certificate as an elected member of assembly from 52 South-West Nagpur Constituency with immediate effect. He appealed to declare that Fadnavis’ rival Ashish Deshmukh be declared elected from the constituency, as he had received a majority of the valid votes while those obtained by former CM were through corrupt practices.

Uke prayed for directives to call all original nomination records of Fadnavis from the returning officer, including affidavit Form 26 submitted by him while filing his papers for contesting last year’s polls, so that they couldn’t be tampered with. He demanded declaration of Fadnavis’ victory void due to non-compliance with provisions of Constitution of India, the Representation of People Act as well as the rules and orders framed under related laws.

Abdul Shameem and Thoufique

CHENNAI: The two men wanted for the murder of the TN special sub-inspector Y Wilson were picked up from Udupi railway station in Karnataka early on Tuesday.

Police said Abdul Shameem and Thoufique had shaved off their beards and were wearing coolers in a bid to disguise themselves but police acting on a tip-off that they were travelling in an unreserved compartment on the Thiruvananthapuram-Veraval Express intercepted them at Udupi station . The operation was carried out by a joint team of the TN and Kerala police with help from the Karnataka police. Two loaded guns were also seized from the two men.

The TN and Kerala police had formed 10 teams to trace the two after Wilson was gunned down on January 8. One of the teams tapped an informer at a hideout near Pune in Maharastra, who told them about their movement. The police were told the duo were on their way to meet a handler in Bengaluru on Tuesday.

The unarmed 57-year-old Wilson, who was just five months away from retirement, was shot dead while he was manning alone a checkpost near TN’s border with Kerala at Kaliyakkavila in Kanyakumari district. CCTV camera footage from a mosque showed Shameem and Thoufique running back from the checkpost and then nonchalantly walking along the nearby highway into Kerala. Investigators who asked not to be identified said they suspected the two had gunned down the cop after they got wind that their mentor Khaja Moideen had been picked up by the Delhi Police. Moideen and Navas, who was one of the two men picked up with him, had jumped bail along with Shameem in December while on trial for the July 2014 murder of Hindu Munnani functionary Suresh Kumar at Ambattur in Chennai.

The search for Wilson’s killers has unveiled a network of ISIS sympathisers from Tamil Nadu that police said was masterminded by Khaja Moideen, 52. Soon after the Delhi police announced his arrest, the Gujarat police announced the arrest of a man from Cuddalore, Zafar Ali, at Vadodara, who, investigators said, was a member of a sleeper cell Moideen had set up. Ali was to have been joined by Shameem and Thoufique in a bid to try and garner support among youth in Gujarat, investigators in TN said. Thoufique also has a case against him for attacking a BJP functionary at Nagercoil in 2016.

Shameem and Thoufique are being brought to Kanyakumari on a transit remand granted by an Udupi court, and will be produced before a magistrate court on Wednesday. On Sunday, five other men have been arrested by the Tamil Nadu police, four from a forest area near the tourist centre of Courtallam, known, for its waterfalls, and one from Bengaluru during their search for Shameem and Thoufique. All are suspected of being part of a network that Moideen set up under cover of Al Hind Trust.

Aurangabad: The state minorities development department has decided to follow the Marathwada pattern of solemnising marriages of Muslim couples across Maharashtra but the issue of appointment of qazis has stalled the move.

Sources in the minorities department said that the waqf board has set a condition that the candidate applying for the post of qazi should be ‘aalim’ (a graduate in in Islamic theology from a reputed madrassa), but a number of existing and aspiring qazis are not comfortable with the condition.

“State minorities minister Nawab Malik has decided to set up an expert committee to decide on the issue after stakeholders raised an objection to the waqf board condition.”

Mosques across the state issue couples ‘nikahnama’ or marriage certificate, which needs to be taken to the municipal council or corporation for registration. However, the nikahnama issued by a qazi in Marathwada is recognised by the waqf board and treated like a government document.

According to the government resolution (GR) issued on January 7, qazi, chief qazi and additional qazi are to be appointed in districts and towns across the state. In addition to this, the format of marriage form, marriage certificate for bride and groom has also been approved by the state government.

An official from the minorities department said that the GR will definitely come into force, but only after the expert committee decides on the new rule of the waqf board on appointment of qazi for solemnising marriages. If all goes well, the newly-appointed qazis will be affiliated with the Aurangabad headquartered waqf board and the marriage procedure for Muslims will be easier across the state.

Three days after the GR was issued on January 7, the state issued another GR announcing stalling of the appointment process until further orders, following objections raised by a number of stakeholders to the waqf board condition on qazis.Sources said that after the GR was issued, a delegation of Muslim scholars made a representation to the state minorities minister requesting him to reconsider the existing norms laid down by the waqf board for appointment of qazis.

When contacted, Malik said, “There are certain issues related to the conditions of appointment and they need to be addressed before we go ahead with the appointment of qazis and implementation of the Marathwada pattern of solemnising marriages.”

A waqf official said, “The GR is the result of several years of follow-up with the state minorities department requesting them to implement Marathwada pattern in the state and streamline the marriage record.”

Malappuram: Shoranur-Nilambur rail line would be opened for night traffic from January 20, Monday.

The office of the operational manager of Palakkad Division of Southern Railway has issued an order approving opening of the line for night traffic, on Tuesday.

It was a long-pending demand for the night train services to operate through the line. When the general manager of Southern Railway visited Angadippuram and Nilambur stations recently, different organizations had approached him with the same demand.

The order issued on Tuesday says that necessary arrangements would be made for dealing with the trains during night hours on the rail line from Monday.

The Southern Railway office in Chennai had granted technical permission for the night-traffic on the line in December. At present Nilambur-Shoranur line closes after Nilambur-Kochuveli Rajyarani Express leaves Nilambur station at 8.50pm and the section opens only at 6am for Kochuveli-Nilambur Rajyarani Express which arrives at 7.50am next day.

It is expected that the opening of the section during night hours will allow Kochuveli-Nilambur Rajyarani Express train to reach Nilambur around 5.30am.

Nilambur rail action council which was on warpath raising the demand for night-traffic on the line expressed their gratitude to the rail minister Piyush Goyal, local MP P V Abdul Wahab and Railway officials for their efforts to introduce night traffic on the line. Meanwhile, the electrification on the rail line will begin soon, as L&T gets contract for the electrification of the rail line. The electrification of the line is expected to increase the speed of the trains on the track and bring down the operation cost. The railway board had granted permission for the project last year and a detailed project report (DPR) regarding the electrification project was submitted to Central Organisation for Railway Electrification (Core), Allahabad.

Representtaive image

NASHIK: The Bhadrakali police have booked two vendors for selling nylon manja and have seized the banned product worth over Rs 16,500 from them.

The suspects have been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, said police.

After receiving a tip-off about nylon manja being sold in markets, police teams raided two shops, conducted inspections and seized the banned product. While the first raid was carried out on January 8, the second one was undertaken on January 13.

Deputy commissioner of police (zone II) Amol Tambe said that the police is keeping a tight vigil on those selling kites to ensure that the banned product is not being sold anywhere.

He appealed to revellers to refrain from buying or using the banned product. In addition, police have appealed to the citizens to come forward and inform them if they come across any sale or purchase of the banned product.

Moreover, the local NGOs have also been roped in to keep an eye on kite vendors. The members of Manav Uthan Manch have been displaying placards at traffic signals since a month informing people of the damage caused by nylon manja.

“We have created some animated videos and have forwarded them to maximum people explaining about the dangers of using nylon manja and the effect it has on humans as well as birds and animals,” Jagbir Singh , secretary of the NGO, said.

378,['15/01/2020'],Bengalis being hounded out of BJP-run states: Didi,"This story is from January 15, 2020

KOLKATA: Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday accused BJP of hounding Bengalis out of states where it is in power and plotting to “make Indians foreigners in their own country” while offering citizenship to outsiders funding the party.

“Even before the CAA rules have been framed, they are talking of 30,000 citizenship applications. Where have these come from? They (the applicants) are funding BJP,” she said while addressing an anti-citizenship law rally organised by TMC’s student wing on Rani Rashmoni Avenue. Mamata reminded BJP members that “in united India”, people had the right to move out of their state to another for work.

“But I am seeing that people from Bengal are being hounded out of states where BJP is in government. This should not be repeated. If this happens, or is repeated, then people of no state will be safe in another,” the chief minister said.

Claiming to have solved the “mystery of CAA”, Mamata said that BJP’s ploy was not only to grant citizenship to those funding it but also ensure that no case can be made out against “such foreign contributions”.

“These people are going to convert black money into white. BJP is now going from door to door to find out who is Hindu and who is Muslim, and they are going to provide some people with citizenship,” she said.

Mamata said contrary to BJP’s assertion, CAA-NRC-NPR were interlinked. “NRC is not for Hindus or Muslims. It is for all. It is being said it is only for Muslims, which is not true... baaje kotha (false talk). It will affect all Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Jews. In Assam , during the NRC process, 19 lakh Hindu names were left out. If a fire or flood takes place, then it will affect all, irrespective of religion.” Mamata said she met PM Narendra Modi at Raj Bhavan during his visit to Kolkata last Saturday only out of courtesy.

379,['15/01/2020'],"A week on, citizens still fight tooth and nail against implementation of CAA","This story is from January 15, 2020

Aurangabad: The round-the-clock sit-in agitation by people from different walks of life in the city against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register for Citizenship (NRC) on Tuesday entered its seventh day.

A forum, Aurangabad against CAA, NRC, NPR, has been formed by the citizens for providing a platform to all those protesting against the government’s move.

A pandal has been set up outside the revenue divisional commissioner’s office where a large number of people from different age groups are protesting by singing folk songs, reciting poems, shayari and raising slogans.

Ahmed Jalees, a civil contractor and one of the protesters, said, “Through this protest we are trying to bring it to fore that these new rules are not only discriminatory against Muslims, but also against all those belonging to the reserved categories.”

“The poor, downtrodden and those belonging from the reserved category who will fail to produce documents prior to 1971 will be excluded from the NRC list. Of those excluded everyone except Muslims will be given fresh citizenship through CAA,” he added.

“This granting of fresh citizenship through CAA will deprive them of their reservation category as they will be treated as people with fresh citizenship,” CPI office-bearer Abhay Taksal said.

“If the voter-id is not a proof of citizenship then why do politicians seek our votes. According to the government, even AADHAR card, PAN card and passport are not proof of citizenship, then why is AADHAR linked with bank accounts, or taxes are collected through PAN. Also, why Indians are allowed to fly abroad using these passports,” student activist Kunal Kharat asked.

Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel said the common citizens hit the street to reclaim their rights after it became unbearable for them.

“The government is pushing their agenda by portraying that Muslims are against CAA, NRC and NPR. In fact, whoever is pro-Constitution is against these draconian laws,” he said.

Sumit Pandit, an activist, said that the on-going protest is nothing but the fight to save the Constitution. To ensure that the protest remains politically neutral, the forum has invited members as well as officer-bearers of all political parties without any discrimination.

380,['15/01/2020'],Signal to control vehicular movement at Sadar flyover,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Nagpur: The Sadar flyover, inaugurated by city MP and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari on January 9, is causing a bottleneck on the side of its landing between Vidhan Bhavan Square and LIC Square on the busy Wardha-Kamptee Road.

To ease the congestion, the traffic police and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) have found a solution to the problem. They have installed a traffic signal at the landing of the flyover.

“Until the signals are installed, we have decided to restrict the vehicles coming towards LIC Square from Vidhan Bhavan Square to use the Kamptee-Wardha Road. We will divert the vehicles from beneath the Sadar flyover and they can either take the Shriram Towers road or use the Liberty Square road to move towards Kamptee Road,” deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Chinmay Pandit told TOI.

However, those who used the Y-shaped flyover towards Katol Road and Mankapur Squares had a smooth sailing.

Pandit along with senior traffic police inspectors Jayesh Bhandarkar and Atul Sabnis, NHAI project director Abhijit Jichkar, officials from the NMC’s traffic department carried out a spot inspection. During the construction of the flyover, TOI had highlighted the issue of the likely mess near the same spot.

To avoid collusion of vehicles coming from the flyover, the traffic police have diverted them towards LIC Square and provided a U-turn for them to go towards Vidhan Bhavan Square. Though it has eased congestion at the flyover’s landing but it is causing a bottleneck at two merger points on either side of the road, between LIC Square and Samvidhan Square.

During the two-hour spot check, TOI observed that traffic from the Sadar flyover heading towards Samvidhan Square was facing a tough time and it was causing a bottleneck at the traffic lights on the stretch.

Due to the faulty design, a stop-gap measure was put in place. Traffic coming from the Sadar flyover and going toward Wardha Road is being diverted with the help of a U-turn near LIC Square. There’s also a flip side to the move. It’s affecting the flow of traffic coming from either side of Wardha Road.

TOI also found many motorists (coming from the flyover and intending to go towards Liberty Talkies), especially two-wheelers, taking the wrong side as a shortcut, adding to the congestion at the landing spot.

After discussing the situation with NHAI officials, the DCP traffic said that installing a traffic signal at the landing area is a permanent solution to the problem.

“When the signal for vehicles coming from the Sadar flyover turns green, for those coming from both LIC and Samvidhan Square, it will be red. The distance between LIC Square and Samvidhan Square is around 200m. It is the only permanent solution the traffic police have found to regulate vehicular movement at the flyover landing spot,” the DCP said.

The traffic police will submit its recommendation to install a signal at the flyover landing spot.

“It’s unethical to complain about any project after its completion when the same is being constructed before your eyes. In 2017, the VTA delegation met the NHAI director to study the plan of the Sadar flyover so that suggestions, if needed, could be submitted before its completion,” said Tejinder Singh Renu, secretary of Vidarbha Taxpayers’ Association (VTA).

“The NHAI plan was good and hence, we appreciated it. Later, the plan was modified by the authorities at the landing area on the RBI side, probably due to the Metro project and we learnt about it recently,” pointed out Renu.

In the original plan, the divider on the Kamptee Road junction at the landing spot on RBI side was open and a separate loop for traffic towards Kamptee side and Kingsway was proposed. These two modifications have caused major traffic problems at the landing area on the RBI side.

“We need some modifications in the landing area to ease the traffic. Otherwise, traffic moving in the north-south direction will avoid using this flyover and the objective to provide time and traffic advantage will not serve its purpose,” Renu added.

He noticed another flaw in the project. “The RCC parapet wall on the flyover is quite low. It may be as per the NHAI norms, but for the traffic in the city, it could be dangerous, especially for two-wheelers. Some kind of an MS frame on the parapet is needed,” said Renu.

Endorsing Renu’s views, traffic activist Deepak Lalwani, who owns a shop on Residency Road, stressed the need to install delineators on the flyover to bifurcate traffic coming from either side of the flyover.

PROS AND CONS

THE CURRENT SCENARIO

* Sadar flyover causing a major traffic hurdle at landing area on RBI side

* U-turn near LIC Square for Sadar flyover causing jam at merger points on either side of road

* Impatient drivers and riders using wrong side as a short cut, making the situation more chaotic

TEMPORARY MEASURES

* Traffic moving towards LIC Square from Samvidhan Square will be blocked with barricades

* It will be diverted from the road beneath the new flyover

* Vehicles heading towards Kamptee can take right turn from NIT office via LIC Square or have other options like Sadar Coffee House Square

* Vehicles can also take the flyover and can take right turn from Mankapur Square for Kamptee

PERMANENT SOLUTION

* Traffic signal will be installed at the median to pave way for vehicles coming from Sadar flyover

* When signal for vehicles coming from Sadar flyover turns green, for those coming from both LIC Square and Samvidhan Square, it will be red

Kite effect: Sadar flyover closed today (10am to 10pm)

Due to the kite-flying festival of Makarsankranti, the Sadar flyover will be closed on Wednesday from 10am to 10pm. “The decision was taken as a preventive measure in view of two-wheeler riders getting injured due to kite strings,” said Atul Sabnis, senior PI (traffic) of Sadar Zone. A notification in this regard was issued to the media to inform citizens.

381,['15/01/2020'],Drones to survey gaothan areas for cluster devpt,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Nashik: The agency appointed by the Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) for conducting a survey of the old city (gaothan) areas for cluster development has begun its work with the help of drones.

This is for the first time that gadgets such as drones are being used by the civic body for carrying out development in the congested old city areas.

Once the survey is completed, the agency will prepare a report detailing the congested zones in the old city areas, following which the civic body will prepare a blueprint for its development under the cluster development programme.

The NMC has deployed private consultancy agency M/s Crisil Risk and Infrastructure to conduct impact assessment survey in core areas of the city.

Earlier, the municipal corporation had sought permission from the police administration for carrying out the drone survey. However, the administration had advised the NMC to seek permission from the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).

Thereafter, the civic administration had again urged the police administration to grant permission for the drone survey stating that it will follow all the guidelines set by the DGCA.

Accordingly, the police administration recently issued permission to the NMC for conducting survey of gaothan areas using drones.

The appointed agency will now carry out the survey and shortlist areas that require improvement, estimate number of buildings and the number of clusters. Also, providing facilities like open space, roads, parking, waste and sewage management will also have to be considered while conducting the survey and preparing the report.

“We have received permission from the police administration to conduct drone survey of gaothan areas. The agency has already started the survey from the Panchavati area of the city,” a civic official said.

The survey is to be conducted in gaothan areas including the old city, Satpur, Deolali gaon, Makhmalabad, Adgaon and other parts of the city.

The ready reckoner rates remained unchanged in 2018-19 and 2019-20. (File photo)

PUNE: Land use changes in the past two years, boundary modifications from rural to urban areas, sale transactions in all zones and alterations in the development control rules will be reflected in this year’s “rationalized” Ready Reckoner (RR) rates expected to be announced on April 1.

The RR rates are assessments of property value by the state government, on the basis of which stamp duty and registration charges are paid and properties valued. The government usually revises the rates every year.

“There are several instances of changes in land use. For instance, some agriculture zones have become residential in nature, leading to increased land transactions. Many areas been merged in the corporation limits as well. All this will be reflected in the RR rates this time,” a revenue department official said.

The state has been divided into four regions — rural, influential (peri-urban areas peripheral to urban areas), municipal council and municipal corporation areas — to compile the RR rates. “The valuation this time will be done rationally and at the micro level,” an official privy to the process said.

Last week, deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar held a meeting with the registration department and told its officials to ready the rates in a rationalized way for both the urban and rural zones through a zone-wise analysis.

A release issued after the meeting stated that the new government has sought streamlining of the RR rates without increasing stamp duty. The aim is to improve revenue from the registration of property sale. This year, the department’s revenue target is Rs 27,000 crore. With a deficit of Rs 43,000 crore, Pawar said a separate team would be set up to study the market rate of properties and prepare the RR rates.

Officials in the revenue department it would have to ready the entire chart by the end of February for the rates to be declared on April 1.

An official said it was too early to state if the new government would like to maintain a status quo on this year’s rates or announce any change.

The state had in 2017-18 increased the RR rates by 3.9% and kept it unchanged in 2018-19 and 2019-20.

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to appoint a new contractor for door-to-door garbage collection from its Panchavati and Cidco divisions.

The new contractor will also have to provide vans for the filth collection. The civic body had earlier terminated the services of the last contractor due to its shoddy services. “We have entrusted the works of lifting garbage in these two divisions through garbage van contractors, who are already working in the other four divisions of NMC. But we are in the process of floating a tender to rope in a new contractor in Panchavati and Cidco division,” said Sunil Bukane, director, NMC’s Solid Waste Management department.

Earlier, a lot of complaints were raised about the irregular garbage collections in both the divisions, which forced them to terminate the services. “We are expecting the tender process to be started and completed quickly,” he added.

Another major reason for terminating the services was not paying the salaries of garbage van workers on time, even though the NMC paying the bills on time. Even after over 30 show-cause notices in the past two years, things didn’t improve, which forced the NMC chief Radhakrishna Game to cut-short the services.

Apart from Panchavati and Cidco, other four divisions of the civic body include Nashik Road, Satpur, Nashik East and Nashik West.

Nagpur: Newly anointed home minister Anil Deshmukh displayed his other side on Monday when he visited the Late Ambadaspant Vaidya Matimand Mukbadhir Bewaris Balgruh in Amravati on Monday.

On the request of its owner Shankarbaba Papalkar, the Katol MLA himself prepared tea and served it to the orphans and senior citizens, much to their delight. A video showing the minister preparing tea on a chullah inside Papalkar’s hut went viral on social media and was appreciated for his noble gesture.

Deshmukh is a regular visitor to the Papalkar’s orphanage, which not only takes care of orphans and mentally challenged but also some senior citizens. Even before the assembly polls, he visited the orphanage sought Papalkar’s blessings, said the octogenarian. Papalkar looks after 123 inmates on the sprawling 25-acre premises located on Dharni Road.

“It was most the satisfying experience I ever had after serving those orphans and mentally challenged children. I stayed there for over an hour and interacted with them. The smiles on their faces made my day,” said an elated Deshmukh.

The minister also attended engagement ceremony of inmates Varsha and Sameer, both deaf and mute and hailing from Papalkar’s orphanage. “Since it was my first visit after becoming the minister, Papalkar asked me to witness their engagement and also perform the role of bridegroom’s father. After they exchanged garlands, I assured them that their marriage would be solemnized in Nagpur shortly where I will perform bride’s kanyadaan,” Deshmukh said.

Papalkar, who’s fighting for amendment in the Orphanages and other Charitable Homes (Supervision and Control) Act, 1960, said all inmates were extremely happy to see Deshmukh. “He freely mingled with the inmates who all are familiar with him. When he asked me whether I need any monetary help for running the centre, I told him that we don’t want money, but want to have tea made by you and he readily agreed,” he said.

Talking about the engagement ceremony between the orphans, the 80-year-old said it was a love marriage between Varsha and Sameer. “Police had found 22-year-old Varsha on railway tracks and handed over to us. Similarly, the boy, who’s now 24 years of age, was found at Shirdi. Varsha now cooks for 50 inmates and takes their care while Sameer was assured a job in Buldhana Cooperative Bank by Radheshyam Chandak after marriage,” he said.

“We’ve planned their marriage on a big stage at Reshimbagh Ground where we’re expecting a turnout of over one lakh people. Collector Ravindra Thakare has agreed to play maternal uncle’s role while police commissioner BK Upadhayay would be the bridegroom’s father. We’ve decided to name this ceremony as “Rashtriya Mohotsav’ to spread the message of amending the Act to allow orphans/mentally challenged to stay beyond 18 years with same shelter home,” he added.

Deshmukh assured Papalkar to raise his demand with social justice minister Dhananjay Munde to see if amendment could be made in the existing laws to take care of orphans, who find themselves in the lurch after becoming adults.

Hyderabad: The wait for Karvy Stock Broking Ltd investors to get their money back is getting longer. Swamped by investor complaints since the scam broke out in November 2019, Karvy group on Tuesday reached out to investors saying that their payouts will be cleared by the first week of February this year. However, the once-bitten-twice-shy investors are sceptical as Karvy has failed to stick to its payout deadlines over the past two months.

When the scam came into light in November last year, C Parthasarathy, chairman and managing director of the Hyderabad-based Karvy Group had said that the company will clear all payouts by the first week of December.

What is also pinching many seasoned investors is that they have missed cashing in on market highs on multiple occasions in the last two months as their money is stuck with Karvy.

“There are many brokers who offer discounted brokerage but I opened my account with Karvy as they were an established broking house. The scam has come as a bolt from the blue. My entire trading capital has been blocked due to this scam. Karvy has been coming up with new dates for payouts since the scam broke, but they have lost all credibility as they have still not honoured their promises. I don’t know when I will get my money back. In the meantime, the market has scaled new highs over the past two months. All the Karvy scam victims have lost out on opportunities,” said Deepesh Kumar, an investor from Mumbai, who is awaiting a payout of over Rs 5 lakh from the company.

Gautam Umaraliya, who hails from Bhavnagar in Gujarat, said his shares worth Rs 7 lakh are out of bounds for him due to the scam. “I planned to buy property here but had to postpone it because my resources are stuck with Karvy and I do not have enough money at hand now. I have reached out to them multiple times about my shares but have not got any satisfactory response. What shocks me is the inaction of SEBI and other authorities as many investors like me are scared of losing our hardearned money. The culprits should be arrested.”

An investor from Sivasagar in Assam, Ankit Garg said when the scam broke out and he checked the status of his shares, he was shocked to find that 30% of his shares valued at around Rs 2.5 lakh were lying in Karvy’s pool account. “I lodged a complaint with Sebi on December 3, which the market regulator forwarded to Karvy on December 18 asking it to reply within three days but they have not responded despite sending multiple reminders,” he rued.

When contacted, the company did not share the exact number of investors and the quantum of money they have to pay them but said they have been reaching out to investors individually and is hopeful of fulfilling commitment this time.

Nagpur: Two migrant hawkers were killed and another 10, all natives of Madhya Pradesh, were injured when a tipper laden with loose earth hit a Bolero pick up van on which the victims were travelling. They were all sellers of household plastic goods.

The accident had taken place on Ring Road at accident-prone Mhalgi Nagar chowk at 6.55 am on Tuesday. The signal had just turned green for the Bolero which tried to cross the square at high speed. The tipper entered the square despite its signal having turned red as per CCTV footage in possession of TOI and hit the rear side of Bolero.

It is learnt the victims were coming to city from a village in Mandsaur district of MP, covering around 800 km, to sell their ware. They are unable to cultivate any crops in their village in Chambal river basin. The river kept most of the lands around their village submerged this year. They had come earlier for a brief period and around three months ago had rented a place at Khapri. The community of hawkers brought household plastic goods from Hyderabad for selling in Nagpur and other places.

Rahul Vanjara and Baharulal Gaud, both aged 25 years old, were the ones killed. They were crushed under the plastic cargo loaded in the pick up in which 13 persons were travelling. After being hit on the left side, the jeep crashed into the divider and fell on it’s side. Gaud had married around two years ago.

Though Bolero’s driver Fakira Babukhan was among the injured, Tofan Vanjara seated beside him escaped unhurt. Tofan’s younger brother Jagdish is learnt to be in a critical condition. The injured are being treated at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH).

The tipper, owned by Javed Khan, was moving towards Hudkeshwar Road from Gajanan chowk. The Bolero was heading towards Dighori naka from Manewada side. The footage of a camera installed at the junction showed the truck trying to pass through the square in red signal. Despite its slow speed, the truck did not wait for the fast moving Bolero to cross the junction ending up hitting it.

Of the injured, Rahul Baghara said he was thrown out of the vehicle by the impact and landed some distance away. “People rushed to help us but the damage was already done. Onlookers rushed us to hospital. There was one person who helped us a lot,” he said.

Sakkardara police have arrested the driver of the tipper, Shamnath Tikapate, and booked him for causing death due to negligence. The truck has also been seized.

Trichy remains on top closely followed by Madurai which got 15,572 feedback and Salem with 5,130

TRICHY: Despite its plunge in ranking for the first two quarters of the cleanliness survey, Trichy corporation has managed to lead the rest of Tamil Nadu in recording feedback from residents for Swachh Survekshan 2020 (SS2020), the national cleanliness survey conducted by the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA).

Citizen feedback for the activities taken up by the local body is one of the key parameters for a city to score significant marks in the survey for being crowned the cleanest city. Of the total 6,000 marks, 25% is earmarked for the citizen feedback category. The feedback will be obtained by the designated agency through face-to-face interviews, outbound calls, Swachhata application, Swachh Survekshan 2020 portal and “vote for your city” application. The feedback includes negative responses to a questionnaire to evaluate the performance of the local body in waste collection, public toilet maintenance and public hygiene. The number of feedback received by a civic body also plays a role in grabbing adequate marks in the survey, officials added.

As on January 14, Trichy stood first among the cities in the state in the number of feedback received through the multiple platforms. With 15,897, Trichy remains on top closely followed by Madurai which got 15,572 feedback and Salem with 5,130.

“We have planned to reach out to the colleges, residents welfare associations and traders for their feedback on the work we have taken up in the past one year,” a sanitary official with the city corporation said.

Students of New English School, Ramanbaug, get into a kite formation on Tuesday to spread awareness about safe... Read More

PUNE: Kites are set to dot the sky on Makar Sankranti on Wednesday with Punekars ready to usher in the harvest festival.

Kothrud resident Shubhangi Barve said her two sons were excited to fly kites. “This time, one of my sons will be flying kites for the first time, so he is very excited,” she said. Barve added that they were using traditional string as manja. “We made sure to buy simple thread to use as the kite string. This time, my elder son Sachin found some videos online on how to make kites and he has made his own kites following the instructions,” she said.

She added that this was also a time all the neighbours got together. “Everyone heads to the terrace of our buildings to watch the children fly kites. Everyone meets and gets a chance to exchange sweets like Tilgul,” she said.

The Tamil community will also be celebrating the harvest festival Pongal from Tuesday. Both festivals centre around different kinds of sweetmeats and festive wear to signal the mark the Sun’s transition into Makara (Capricorn) and the start of longer days.

Explaining the significance of Pongal and Makar Sankranti, assistant professor at the department of English at Ferguson College Chitra Sridharan said, “Pongal literally means boiling over. As part of this, you cook the rice and add plenty of milk with sweet. This is supposed to spill over. It is a metaphor for abundance and bringing in the harvest.”

About Sankranti, she said, “While in South India, it is called Pongal, it is known as Makar Sankranti here and also signifies the harvest season. The Marathi community have a Haldi Kunku at the very start. They have a custom called ‘lootna’ where they give you something sweet. Generally, it means the spring equinox is starting.”

Protests at Shaheen Bagh against CAA and NRC on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Tuesday declined to pass any specific directions against restrictions in place on the Kalindi Kunj - Shaheen Bagh stretch due to CAA protests. But it asked police and the state government to look into the problems faced by commuters while keeping in mind the larger public interest.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar noted that whenever an agitation or protest erupts, the situation becomes “fluid” as it keeps changing with the temperament of the protesters. “Simultaneously, police have to maintain the law and order....they have all power, jurisdiction and authority to control the traffic, wherever protests or agitations are going on, in the larger public interest,” the bench noted, adding that “it all depends upon the ground reality and the wisdom of the police.”

It, however, asked the police and traffic authorities to examine the grievance raised in a petition against the continued blockade and disposed of a PIL filed by advocate Amit Sahni. It had sought a direction to the Delhi police commissioner to lift restrictions on Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch and Okhla underpass, which were closed on December 15, 2019 for ongoing protests against CAA and NRC.

The PIL argued that the clampdown was a temporary measure but had been extended from time to time. Closure of Kalindi Kunj stretch, which connects Delhi, Faridabad (Haryana) and Noida (Uttar Pradesh), has forced commuters to take the Delhi-Noida-Delhi (DND) Flyway and Ashram, triggering traffic jams and wastage of time and fuel.

According to the petitioner, the road closure is causing huge inconvenience to lakhs of commuters everyday as they are compelled to take different routes for last one month while students are forced to travel for hours to ensure they reach school in time. The petition claimed that the authorities have failed to take appropriate action to give relief to the residents of the locality and lakhs of commuters of Delhi, UP and Haryana despite representation to them.

Owing to the heavy traffic on alternative routes, it takes 15-20 minutes for people to cross just one traffic signal at Ashram, it claimed.

Pune: Vandals damaged a total of 20 vehicles on Monday night — eight in Sanjay Gandhinagar in Pimpri and 12 in Hadapsar.

Two persons — Akshay Bhosale (20) and Deepak Raut (19) of Pimpri — of a gang of six were arrested on Tuesday. The others are on the run, said sub-inspector AP Nimgire of the Pimpri police.

The Wanowrie police, on the other hand, detained six minors on Tuesday for their involvement in damaging the parked vehicles in Hadapsar.

Around 10.30pm on Monday, the gang of six, armed with sticks, entered the Sanjay Gandhinagar area on motorcycles. They created a ruckus and abused residents. “All of sudden, they started damaging the vehicles parked along the road,” Nimgire said.

He said the suspects damaged parked two-wheelers, an autorickshaw and a van. The terrified residents alerted the police. “When we reached the spot, the suspects had fled,” Nimgire said.

The Pimpri police took Bhosale and Raut into custody after launching a manhunt. Prima facie probe revealed that the suspects had damaged the vehicles under the influence of alcohol, police said.

Senior inspector Krantikumar Patil of the Wanowrie police said the minors broke the windscreens of the parked autorickshaws, four-wheelers and commercial vehicles.

391,['15/01/2020'],MADC awaits state order on Purandar airport project,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Pune: The Maharashtra Airport Development Company Limited (MADC) is banking on the outcome of its board meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and awaiting an order from the state government for the future of the proposed airport in Purandar.

A day after deputy CM Ajit Pawar stressed last-mile connectivity for Purandar, the stakeholders are expecting some movement in the project that was announced in October 2016 but has failed to gather much pace.

“The project has been delayed. We hoped that funds will flow once the the state got a new government after the elections. But the delay in government formation had a cascading effect on the Purandar project. Once the government directs us, we will issue a notification for land acquisition in Purandar,” an MADC official said on Tuesday.

Pawar on Monday discussed the connectivity issues related to the Purandar airport with the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), indicating that the project was still on track.

Purandar MLA Sanjay Jagtap on Tuesday said the government was “very positive” about the project and would soon make a formal announcement on it. “We have requested Pawar to shift the project to a different place in Purandar from the proposed site,” he told TOI.

Altogether 2,832 hectares of land in Purandar taluka are likely to be acquired for the project. Landowners of Pargaon, Khanauri, Munjwadi, Udachiwadi, Ekhatpur, Vanpuri and Kumbharvan villages have been opposing the project.

Aviation expert Dhairyashil Vandekar recently said the city needed a new airport, as the facility in Lohegaon was under pressure with the number of flights rising. Air Marshal Bhushan Gokhale (retired) said, “The government should take a concrete stand on the issue instead of urging Indian Air Force to provide more land for the expansion of the airport in Lohegaon.”

392,['15/01/2020'],NMC collects Rs 116 crore property tax,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Nashik: The property tax department of the Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) has garnered Rs 116 crore this fiscal, the highest so far.

The second highest property tax collection of Rs 113 crore was recorded during last financial year 2018-19. It was for the first time that the NMC’s property tax collection target had touched Rs 100 crore.

During the corresponding period last year (by Jan 13), the property tax collection ofstood at Rs 94 crore. There has been almost 25% rise in property tax collection by January 13 of the current financial year as compared to corresponding period last year.

Civic officials said that an increasing number of defaulters are coming forward to clear their dues as the municipal corporation has been prompt in serving notices to defaulters warning them of auctioning their properties if they failed to clear the dues.

“We had introduced amnesty scheme for property tax defaulters around three months back. We had collected property tax dues amounting to Rs 30 crore during just one month due to amnesty scheme,” civic officials said.

NMC officials said that they are optimistic about meeting the set target of Rs 218 crore from property tax this fiscal.

There are over 4.35 lakh property tax payers across six divisions of municipal corporation. Of which, 1.97 lakh property tax defaulters have total tax dues worth Rs 53.28 crore.

There are about 439 big property tax defaulters with dues of over Rs 50,000 each while around 1,240 tax defaulters have dues between Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000. There are 1.95 lakh defaulters who have dues below Rs 10,000.

393,['15/01/2020'],Litmus test for contestants in Medchal,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Voters of Medchal municipality — richest in terms of revenue — are bracing up to grill contesting candidates over unfulfilled assurances, especially those made by labour minister Ch Malla Reddy.

Failure to construct a 4-km flyover to ease traffic problems on NH-44, frequent traffic jams, narrow internal roads, lack of a permanent dumpyard and failure to provide an uninterrupted water supply are some of the immediate issues high on the agenda of voters. Though a detailed project report (DPR) for the underground drainage is ready, it has gathered dust due to inordinate delay in releasing funds.

Little wonder, the coming municipal polls are going to be a litmus test for the candidates in all 23 civic wards. The municipality makes nearly Rs 7 crore from property tax alone from various commercial godowns and industrial units, but basic amenities are still a far cry.

The major issue bothering the voters is the delay in executing the 4-km flyover between Athvelly village and Outer Ring Road on National Highway-44. Currently, the two-lane NH-44 passing through Medchal is narrow and unable to manage the heavy volumes of traffic. As a result, traffic jams during peak hours have become the order of the day.

“Every day, we experience traffic jams on NH-44. Malla Reddy had promised the flyover but it remained a distant dream. We bought a flat in Medchal so that we could lead a peaceful life. But, the burgeoning traffic mess here is worse than what commuters face in Hyderabad,” Mallikharjuna Reddy, a pharmacist, told TOI.

While the main roads in some of the residential colonies in Medchal town are in good condition, internal roads are too narrow with private properties’ owners not willing to part with their land. The civic body has also failed to improve the internal road network and connect it to newly-emerged residential colonies. “We will support only those candidates who will resolve our day-to-day problems,” Naresh Chary, a resident of RTC Colony, said.

The civic body’s hands are also tied with no government land in its possession to set up a permament dumping yard for garbage. Currently, the garbage is dumped in a private land. “Though the dumping yard is 3 km away from the town, it stinks during the rainy season. The civic authorities should shift the dumping yard to another place to avoid inconvenience to residents of various colonies,” said P Vaishali, a private school teacher.

Municipal commissioner B Satyanarayana Reddy said the DPR on the drainage network is ready. “We are waiting for the state government’s nod for financial assistance,” he added.

Sources said that the appointments in the board and a head office in Dehradun would be made in the next few months.The board will bring Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri, Yamunotri and 51 other temples in the hill state under the ambit of the state government and will also result in the dismantling of the existing temple managements such as the Badri-Kedar Temple Committee. The provisions and composition of the Bill will be like the Vaishno Devi shrine board and Tirupati Balaji shrine board.Meanwhile, local priests and Congress MLA from Kedarnath Manoj Rawat threatened to launch a protest against the Bill and said that it is against the interests of the priests’ community. Rawat said, “The state government is ruining the century-old Hindu traditions set up by Adi Shankaracharya for Char Dham. This government is doing something which even the British couldn’t do.”Rawat added that unlike Vaishno Devi, Char Dham has everything in place. “From rituals to appointments and tenure of priests, everything is in place in Char Dham. The takeover will mean dismantling a perfect system that is in place. Why does the government even want that?”Badrinath priest Ashutosh Semwal said, “Our community is opposed to the new board as it will undermine the existing system. We will soon hold a meeting of all priests to decide the next course of action.”However, state government spokesperson and Haridwar MLA Madan Kaushik said that the system of head priests, which was set up by Adi Shankaracharya, will continue as it is. “The new board will not interfere in the daily operational affairs.

The hike, in the range of 0-to-15%, has evoked mixed reactions from residents.Some residents claimed that revised circle rates will make buying property in the city more costly while others felt that it was needed to streamline property rates. “As Rajpur and other prime localities hardly have any plots left, people are buying land in other areas. But now, their circle rates have been increased. This will make it difficult for people to buy land in the city,” said Rajvir Pundhir, a Nehru Colony resident.On the other hand, some believe that the decision would prove beneficial. “The decision would reduce gap between the circle rate and actual market rate. However, it may increase burden on those looking to buy land,” said S Benjwal, a retired teacher who lives in Mothrowala area.The major areas where circle rate has been revised from Rs 14,000 to Rs 16,000 are Karanpur Chowk, Dehrakhas, Shimla bypass, Premnagar, Mata Mandir Road, Vasant Vihar, Mohit Vihar, and Ashirwad Enclave among others.Similarly, the main areas where circle rate has been increased from Rs 12,000 to Rs 14,000 are Indira Gandhi Marg, Brahmanwala, Doiwala, Transport Nagar, Bhandaribagh, Panditwadi, Shastrinagar, and Nehru Colony among others.The key areas where circle rate has been hiked from Rs 9,000 to Rs 10,500 are Mussoorie bypass, Mothrowala-Dhoodhli route, Banjarawala, Near Doon University, Kedarpur, Niranjanpur, Kargi Grant, and Indresh Nagar.Meanwhile, the cabinet didn’t revise circle rate of areas where it was already above Rs 14,000 square metre.

400,['15/01/2020'],Amnesty scheme: Rs10 cr collected in a month,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Nashik: Over 2,200 people have come forward and cleared their property tax dues ever since the Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) introduced amnesty scheme .

According to the scheme, the defaulters who pay their dues in one time were to be given a waiver in penalty, warrant and notice fees. The civic body has collected property tax dues of around Rs 10 crore from the defaulters.

The NMC has so far waived off around Rs 1.78 crore under this scheme. The amnesty scheme was introduced on December 16 last year and will be in effect till February 10, 2020.

The NMC recovers a 2% fine per month on tax dues from the last day of paying taxes. Moreover, it also recovers expenses of notices and warrants issued to the defaulters. Hence, the civic body had introduced the amnesty scheme.

The defaulters who paid their property tax dues between September 16 and September 30 were given 75% concession on penalty, warrants and notice fess. Those who paid their tax dues between October 1 and 10 were given 50% concession, while those who paid taxes between October 11 and 15 were given 25% concession in penalty and other fees.

“We received good response to the amnesty scheme introduced between September 15 and October 15 in 2019 wherein we collected property tax dues worth Rs 30 crore. This time around we aim to collect around Rs 50 crore,” a civic official said.

Nashik: Mayor Satish Kulkarni approved 18 proposals for naming chowks, elevated storage tanks (ESTs), gardens, roads, new colonies, gymnasium, auditorium and civic school among others, during a meeting of Namkaran Samiti ( naming committee ) on Tuesday.

The meeting of the committee, including officials from the town planning department, civic standing committee chairperson, group leaders and leader of the house was held after around two years.

The mayor had received 148 proposals by elected representatives for naming of roads, chowks and lanes in localities across the city and the same were tabled during the meeting. However, approvals were given to only 18 proposals.

“There is a four-member ward committee and approval to the proposal regarding naming of various chowks or areas will be given if there is consent by all the four corporators,” the mayor said.

“The proposal will be cancelled or adjourned even if one of the corporators does not give his/her consent. Approval will be given immediately if all four corporators unanimously give their approval,” Kulkarni added.

Now, the meeting of naming committee of NMC will be held once in two months. Around 130 proposals did not comply with the norm of having consent of all four corporators.

Of the 18 proposals approved, three each were about naming of chowks and gardens, two each were about naming of ESTs, roads and new colonies, one each for naming of NMC school, auditorium, gymnasium, sports ground, generic medical stores in hospitals and installation of portrait at the meeting hall of the NMC.

There was also controversy over naming of a water treatment plant in ward no 31. While Shiv Sena had demanded naming the plant after the late Balasaheb Thackeray, BJP wanted it to be named after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

Dinkar Patil and three other corportors had submitted a proposal for naming the plant after Vajpayee, but the mayor held back the proposal as it came from corporators from other wards.

PUNE: The crime branch on Monday claimed to have cracked the case of a woman student of FTII being robbed of her bag containing a cellphone and cash, collectively worth Rs9,600, near Nal Stop following the arrest of a person.

The arrested person, Ubed Salim Shaikh (25) of Kasba Peth, had purchased the robbed cellphone from the trio, including a minor, involved in the robbery. Barring the minor suspect, the other two — Rahul Sakat (19) and Kiran Galphade (21) — involved in robbing the FTII student were arrested in another case by the Khadki police and languishing in jail.

The FTII student, along with her friend, was on way to have a cup of tea at a popular joint near Nal Stop during the wee hours after completing a film shooting assignment when she was robbed by the trio on November 25 last year.

The Deccan Gymkhana police had taken the custody of the suspects Sakat and Galphade from the jail. “The duo admitted to their involvement in the robbery on Law College Road and revealed the name of their third accomplice, a minor. Sakat and Galphade has been sent back to jail,” said assistant inspector C M Suryavanshi of the Deccan Gymkhana police.

He said the crime branch had recovered the FTII student’s cellphone from Shaikh. “We have found her purse, which the suspects had thrown behind a public toilet. We have also recovered the motorcycle used while robbing her,” Suryavanshi said.

Sub-inspector Uttam Budgude of the crime branch said constables Sudhakar Waghawale and Sudhakar Mane received a tip-off on January 4 that a cellphone robbed on Law College Road in November last year was being used by Shaikh and he would be going to Mangalwar Peth. “We laid a trap and took Shaikh into custody. We recovered the cellphone from him and handed Shaikh over to the Deccan Gymkhana police,” Budgude said.

Suryavanshi said Shaikh revealed the names of Sakat and Galphade during the questioning.

“Both are criminals on the police records. Sakat has cases of body offences against him, while Galphade has cases of vehicle thefts,” Suryavanshi said.

He said the duo sold the robbed cellphones through their minor accomplice. “We have sent the minor to a correction home,” Suryavanshi said.

NEW DELHI: BJP criticised Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for his comment on the fallout of changes in the citizenship law, but warmed up to the tech czar after he issued a detailed statement where he acknowledged a country’s right to define its borders, ensure national security and determine its immigration policy.

After a comment of Nadella, attributed to him by US digital media platform Buzzfeed , which was seen as critical of the new changes in India’s citizenship law, generated excitement, the Microsoft CEO issued a detailed statement.

“Every country will and should define its borders, protect national security and set immigration policy accordingly. And in democracies, that is something that the people and their governments will debate and define within those bounds. I’m shaped by my Indian heritage, growing up in a multicultural India and my immigrant experience in the US. My hope is for an India where an immigrant can aspire to found a prosperous start-up or lead a multinational corporation benefitting Indian society and the economy at large,” Nadella said in a statement issued by Microsoft India.

Asked about the controversy over the Microsoft chief’s remarks, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra pointed to the latter’s second statement and said it marked an endorsement of what the government has sought to achieve through the new citizenship law. “That is what the government of this country has done. We are looking after national security and protecting borders. As far as immigrants are concerned, there is a process for citizenship. Anybody can apply for citizenship. Even the PM has said so. Once they apply for work permit, for citizenship, many have become citizens. Of course, anybody can then do whatever the Constitution has bestowed on them (sic).”

To a question on CAA, Nadella was quoted by Buzzfeed as saying, “I think what is happening in India is sad...just bad...I would love to see a Bangladeshi immigrant who comes to India and creates the next Unicorn in India or becomes the next CEO of Infosys .”

KOLKATA: A spinal patient travelling to Coimbatore for surgery on low-cost airline SpiceJet was refused a wheelchair by an airline executive at the Kolkata airport’s check-in counter on Tuesday.

All pleas and arguments by Mamta Agarwala — who was leaning heavily on a baggage trolley, wearing a broad orthopaedic belt, evidently in discomfort — and her husband fell on deaf ears. Even efforts by other passengers to make the airline staff see reason failed. It was only when the matter was brought to the notice of the airport director that action was taken, and Mamta issued a wheelchair. Later, a SpiceJet spokesperson issued a statement saying “any shortcoming is deeply regretted”.

Mamta’s airport trauma began around 10.15am, when she and her husband, Tolaram, arrived at departure gate 2A. When she inquired about a wheelchair, the CISF personnel at the gate told her she would have to make the request at the SpiceJet counter. When she made the request at the counter, the executive reportedly told Mamta, “Why did you not make the request at the time of booking the tickets? It is not possible to get a wheelchair now.” Even when Tolaram pointed out that she had problems in her spine, the airline staff allegedly refused to budge.

“Get in touch with the call centre and make your request. I will not be able to provide wheelchair assistance. Please step aside and don’t waste my time,” the Spicejet executive reportedly told Mamta.

Mamta told TOI, “Had I known that the wheelchair needed to be pre-booked, I would have surely done so. But refusing to provide it despite seeing my condition was unfortunate,” she said.

Visakhapatnam: This Sankranti has brought good news for the farmers of north-coastal Andhra pradesh. The three districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam have produced nearly 20 lakh tonnes of paddy .

Over 10 lakh farmers have harvested nearly 4.5 hectares, including 97,000 hectares in Visakhapatnam, 1.4 lakh hectares in Vizianagaram and 2.1 lakh hectares in Srikakulam in the Kharif season, which begins in June and ends by December. Nearly 3.5 lakh tonnes of paddy was grown in Visakhapatnam, 6.5 lakh tonnes Vizianagaram and 10 lakh tonnes in Srikakulam

Speaking to TOI, Visakhapatnam district agriculture department joint director GSNS Leelavathi said, “In Visakhapatnam district alone, an average of 3,300 kgs per hectare paddy has been produced.”

Whereas in Srikakulam district, an average of nearly 4,500 kgs of paddy was produced per hectare. Leelavathi said “This time the paddy crop has yielded good results due to several reasons, including sufficient rain.”

“This time there was no cyclone or bad weather reported in the Kharif season. This helped the farmers to get good returns from the agriculture sector. This Sankranti would be a happy one for the farmers,” said an agriculture scientist.

B Balaram, a farmer from Payakaraopeta in Visakhapatnam, said they got 3,500 kgs of paddy per hectare against last year’s yield of 2,500 kgs. This was because of the favourable weather, he said.

Officials in the agriculture department said the harvesting of paddy crop has been completed in almost all areas in the region, but the hulling and milling is yet to be completed in a few areas.

All the paddy crop of the Kharif season will be completed by the end of January or first week of February. Meanwhile, farmers have already started working on their second crop for the Rabi season, officials added.

SRINAGAR: Arrested DSP Davinder Singh , held for alleged corruption and links with terrorist organisations, was about to be elevated as superintendent of J&K police as per his seniority after having served as a deputy superintendent for 25 years in the police department.The promotion file of several deputy SPs is under process in the office of J&K home commissioner, and Davinder Singh would have made the grade if he had not been busted in the company of Hizb-ul-Mujahideen members while travelling in a Maruti car on January 11, police sources said .The controversial cop’s long run, who was not only involved in extortion cases, but was in league with terror outfits, continues to be animatedly discussed in official and political circles both in Srinagar and in Delhi even as the NIA took over the investigation regarding Singh’s ferrying Hizb terrorists.Singh was held with top Hizbul commander Syed Naveed Mushtaq at a checkpoint on Srinagar-Jammu highway. Mushtaq was reportedly travelling with associates, including a terrorist who recently moved to J&K. Singh has been accused of allegedly ferrying the militants out of the Valley.The DSP has three FIRs filed against him in extortion cases though his “utility” seems to have ensured he was never long in the dog house. His arrest has brought up his connections with Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru who was hanged for the terror attack. Guru’s wife Tabassum had blamed Davinder Singh of demanding Rs 1 lakh for releasing him, claiming she paid after selling of gold ornaments.Guru had alleged that he was asked by Singh to ferry Pakistani terrorist Mohammad to New Delhi and purchase a car for him and his accomplices. Guru said he was to arrange accommodation for the five Pakistani terrorists in an affidavit in Supreme Court through his lawyer Sushil Kumar in 2004.Though Afzal Guru had gone to PoK for arms training with JKLF, he had surrendered to BSF in early 1997 after he was disillusioned with Pakistan. He, however, remained a suspect in police’s eyes, and his wife claimed that among those who picked him up after an incident of terrorist violence included Davinder Singh.Singh had joined the police force as an SI in early 90’s and got out of turn promotions after the creation of an elite force called special operation group in 1994. In March, 2003, the then CM Mufti Sayeed disbanded the Special Operations Group, following the complaints of misuse of power. There were 49 cases of human right abuse cases against 53 SOG officials. The official figures reveal as many 25 officials were dismissed and this was disclosed in the state assembly by the junior home minister A R Veeri of the Mufti government in 2003.Singh was thereafter reinstated and posted in the traffic department and subsequently transferred to various places including Srinagar police control room, Before his arrest, the “delinquent” officer was at Srinagar international airport with anti-hijacking squad of the police, a highly sensitive assignment.He also escorted a 15-member delegation of foreign envoys when the group was on a two-day visit to J&K on January 9.Meanwhile on Tuesday, J&K police raided the house of a Hizb accomplice Irfan Shafi Mir, who was driving the car when Singh and others were held. The police party is said to have recovered Pakistani currency notes from the house of Mir, the sources said.Surprisingly, Irfan, a lawyer by profession, was over ground worker of Hizb and visited Pakistan five times on an Indian passport. Irfan’s father Mohammad Shafi Mir was district Hizb commander in Shopian in early 90’s and is believed to have gone to Pakistan in 1993 and his son Irfan Mir used to visit his father in Pakistan, the sources said.Jammu and Kashmir police on Tuesday said that a special investigating team (SIT) headed by some DIG rank police officer, has been constituted to conduct the probe in the criminal conduct and any such act in the past committed by arrested DSP Davinder Singh. In a series of tweets on its official twitter handle, the police said that a special investigation team is handling interrogation of the arrested accused officer and the militants which would probe his “criminal conduct in the instant case and his involvement in any such criminal acts in the past.” Another tweet by the police read that Jammu Kashmir Police is known for its professionalism and doesn’t spare anyone including its own cadres if found involved in any unlawful act or unbecoming conduct.The J&K Police also denied Singh was awarded a President’s medal. In fact, the police said he was not awarded any gallantry or meritorious medal by the Union ministry for home affairs. The only medal awarded to him was by the erstwhile J&K state on Independence Day in 2018.Read this story in Marathi",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73260891,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-259579,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delinquent-dsp-was-to-get-promotion-as-sp-soon-based-on-his-seniority/articleshow/73260892.cms

Visakhapatnam: At least two cases of financial fraud are reported every day in Vizag on average. Residents, especially unemployed youngsters are falling prey to various kinds of fraud on a regular basis.

Over 2,100 cases of cheating have been reported in the city between 2017 and 2019, informed police commissioner RK Meena.

Defrauding people with the promise of employment is the most common of the offences, closely followed by chit fund-based fraudulent activities.

City police chief RK Meena said that fraudsters are duping youngsters by promising them government jobs as well as jobs abroad. The fraudsters are also duping many through illegal chits, promising them huge returns on investments.

On an average, 1,200 cases of job fraud, chit fraud and online lottery fraud have been reported in Andhra Pradesh only in the last one year. The victims of such scams include not only intermediate and polytechnic diploma pass-outs but also engineering and business school graduates.

According to a senior police official, over 780 cheating cases were registered in 2019, of which nearly 690 cases remain under investigation.

“A majority of such crimes come to light one or two weeks after the fraud. By the time victims of fraud approach the police, fraudsters manage to flee,” said ADCP (crimes) V Suresh Babu.

V Gopinath, inspector of cybercrime police station in Vizag said that cybercriminals have been targeting unemployed youngsters by posting job advertisements in free online classified portals and are duping them by promising jobs in software firms in both India and abroad.

“It is very difficult to recover the money siphoned off from fraudsters in white collar fraud as the cyber crooks operate from metro cities,” he added.

412,['15/01/2020'],ATMs run out of cash ahead of Sankranti,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Several ATMs in the city downed their shutters on Tuesday as people ran from pillar to post in search of money. ‘No cash ’ and ‘out of service’ boards were hung outside several money dispensing machines as people withdrew money in bulk in the days ahead of Sankranti.

Not just the city, the situation is similar in some parts of the district as well as north Andhra. Bankers attribute this to the mad rush for cash before and during festivals. “People generally visit their home towns and go shopping during festivals. So withdrawals would be more than on normal days,” a bank official said.

The city has 400 ATMs of around 50 different banks, both public and private. Cash in around 70 per cent of the ATMs were exhausted in the last two days. North Andhra districts – Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam have around 2,000 ATMs of around 1,400 branches of 50 different banks.

“We visited around 12 to 15 ATMs in Madhurawada but could not find cash. The situation is more or less the same at PM Palem, Yendada, Venkojipalem and other areas. People living in the city’s outskirts are the most affected,” Y Swati, a homemaker, complained.

Both public and private banks failed to anticipate the want of cash. Cash has not been added to most ATMs since Monday morning, IOB customer SS Rao alleged. Serpentine queues could be seen in front of the few ATMs that did have some cash, he added.

“Except on holidays, we fill cash in ATMs every day,” Sai, a senior manager of a public sector bank told TOI.

413,['15/01/2020'],Financially independent family member of road accident victim also entitled to compensation : SC,"This story is from January 15, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has held that family members of a road accident victim cannot be denied compensation merely on the ground that they are not financially dependent on the deceased as his legal representatives have a right to compensation.

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari set aside the verdict of Punjab and Haryana High Court which had held that children of the deceased, who are earning themselves would not be entitled for compensation. The apex court held that liability to pay compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act does not cease because of absence of dependency of the legal representative.

“It is thus settled by now that the legal representatives of the deceased have a right to apply for compensation. Having said that, it must necessarily follow that even the major, married and earning sons of the deceased being legal representatives have a right to apply for compensation and it would be the bounden duty of the Tribunal to consider the application irrespective of the fact whether the legal representative was fully dependant on the deceased,” the bench said.

Quashing the HC order, the bench awarded a compensation of Rs 32 lakh to two sons of a woman who was killed in a road accident in 2014. It said the major married son who is also earning and not dependant on the deceased, would be still be considered ‘legal representative’ of the victim.

The court also clarified that the amount of compensation was to be decided on the consideration of gross salary of a victim and not on the basis of take-home salary. It said the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal had wrongly computed the compensation on the basis of take-home salary and enhanced the amount of compensation.

“It is noticed that the Tribunal proceeded to determine the compensation amount on the basis of net salary drawn by the deceased for the relevant period as Rs 16,918 per month, while taking note of the fact that her gross salary was Rs 23,123 per month (presumably below taxable income). Concededly, any deduction from the gross salary other than tax amount cannot be reckoned. In that, the actual salary minus tax amount ought to have been taken into consideration by the Tribunal for determining the compensation amount,” it said.

414,['15/01/2020'],LHMS gets lukewarm response this Sankranti,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The police department’s plan to curtail possible house break-in incidents through the Locked House Monitoring System ( LHMS ) mobile app during the Sankranti festival vacation has received a lukewarm response from the public.

The police said that only over 50 people in Vizag utilised the LHMS service before they left for Sankranti festival to their home towns. Even though the police have been requesting residents to use LHMS services by installing the CCTV cameras at locked houses before going on vacation, most people seem to have ignored the appeals.

A senior police officer said that Sankranti is one of the major festivals of Telugu people as most of the people visit their home towns to celebrate the three-day festival (Bhogi, Sankranti, and Kanuma). Sankranti vacation is also challenging to the police as burglars plan property offenses around this time as many houses remain locked.

If one choses to use the app, the police will install CCTV cameras at the house of the person free of cost and the cameras are linked to the police control room. If any burglar enters the house, the police will receive an alert.

ADCP (Crimes) V Suresh Babu hopes that the number of people using the app may increase in the coming days. “We are taking all measures to prevent the possible house break-in incidents during the festival,” he added.

Slug: Irrigation Scam

Nagpur: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, facing a barrage of charges in the multi-crore irrigation scam, broke his silence for the first time by filing an affidavit on Tuesday denying all charges by petitioner Atul Jagtap in his four PILs and an application last month.

Questioning the petitioner’s locus standi (credentials), Pawar said Jagtap was misusing PILs to settle personal business rivalry. “He is a contractor and filed tenders in various projects named in his PILs. His allegations are actuated by personal motives and mala fide intentions, which aren’t in nature of PIL. His only intention is to trouble me.”

Opposing the petitioner’s demand to institute an inquiry by either CBI or Enforcement Directorate (ED) into the scam, the deputy CM said no evidence was brought on record to show that exceptional case is made out and investigations require to be transferred to central agencies. “Decision to name the accused is solely discretion of the investigating agency or trial court. Its power can’t be usurped by any person or institution. Since no FIR is registered against me, it can’t be ground to transfer the probe to central agencies as demanded by the petitioner.”

Further clarifying that he wasn’t made an accused in any case, Pawar said accusing him simply on the basis of mala fide statements made in the PILs is violation of his fundamental rights. “If he has grievance that an FIR was not registered against me, or police investigations are not proper, he had alternate remedy under CrPC before the police. He could also have approached the magistrate under the same Act. Petitioner can’t use HC to settle personal scores, and even courts can’t supervise the investigations or direct that a particular person be made an accused.”

Endorsing the ACB director general Parambir Singh’s statement that there was no inconsistency between affidavits filed by him on September 11, 2019, and by his predecessor Sanjay Barve on November 26, 2018, Pawar asserted that all HC directives were scrupulously followed by the government. “The petitioner has decided to don the role of investigating agency by pointing out defects without any expertise. His allegations are totally imaginative and churlish. Singh’s affidavit clarified everything in detail while Barve didn't have the advantage of actual records collected by the investigating officers at later stages, while filing his affidavit.”

Stressing that he followed all rules as former WRD minister, the 59-year-old Pawar said all decisions were taken in accordance with law and with the help of concerned VIDC officials. “The petitioner shouldn’t have any doubt of investigating agencies favouring me as most of the probe was conducted, FIRs registered and charge-sheets were filed during the term of previous (BJP) government, when I was in the opposition,” said Pawar’s affidavit.

While demanding dismissal of Jagtap’s application, the Baramati MLA also denied granting undue favours to any contractor. “I’ve replied to all 68 queries in the questionnaire which proves that I’ve cooperated with the investigations. There are no prayers sought against me in the PILs. I haven’t indulged in any corrupt, motivated or mala fide acts while discharging duties. No wrongdoing can be attributed to me, as all tenders awarded were in accordance with the rules and didn’t have my interference,” he said.

Pawar’s affidavit was filed in response to Jagtap’s application in his four PILs praying for instituting an inquiry by CBI/ED to probe alleged massive embezzlement and corruption in four projects; Jigaon (Buldhana), Lower Pedhi (Amravati), Raigad Barrage (Chandur Railway), and Waghadi (Amravati).

Visakhapatnam: On Bhogi the air quality index in most parts of the city reached hazardous levels, with particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and particulate matter (PM) 10 levels going up. And the sudden dip in temperature only compounded the problem.

Bhogi is a ritual in which old household articles are burnt in a bonfire made of wood and cow-dung cakes. Although, GVMC officials had warned the public against celebrating Bhogi on the streets and burning wood, the ritual continued unabated in most of the parts of the city.

As per the real-time monitoring of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), PM 2.5 at GVMC station was at 275mg/m3 at 6 am on Tuesday while PM 10 was 256 mg/m3. The other pollutants, CO, NO2, SO2, also saw a drastic rise deviating from their normal values.

When the air quality index is poor it can cause breathing discomfort among people who are exposed to it for longer hours. The permissible concentration of PM 2.5 particles is 40 µg/m3 (annual average) and 60 µg/m3 (24-hour average) in industrial, residential, rural or other areas, as per Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), while the permissible limit for PM 10 particles is 60µg/m³ (annual average).

Speaking to TOI, a morning walker, Srinivas, at the RK beach road said, “When I went for my morning walk, I had difficulty breathing and seeing owing to the smog. The pollution was so high that it lead to irritation in my eyes.

NEW DELHI: Indicating its intent to step up agitational politics, Congress on Tuesday formed a high-level “informal” committee to draw up programmes to intensify demonstrations against the BJP government on CAA-NRC and economic issues.

Roughly named “Quick Response Committee”, the “informal” panel comprises senior functionary Ahmed Patel , AICC general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal, All India Congress Committee managers Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Shaktisinh Gohil , Rajeev Satav, Deepender Hooda, Jitin Prasada and Randeep Surjewala .

In the immediate context, the panel is expected to build on the agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, as decided by the joint opposition meeting and Congress Working Committee .

Sources said the party is looking to turn up the heat against Modi government in the Republic Day week by using “celebrations” as the tool. The three important days in the “nationalism calendar” – Netaji Bose’s birth anniversary on January 23, Republic Day on January 26 and Mahatma Gandhi ’s martyrdom day on January 30 – would see “reading of the preamble of the Constitution” and programmes on communal amity across the country.

The panel is expected to focus on how state and its local units can be nudged to organise activities to give sense of a widespread nationwide agitation. Since it decided to hit the streets in recent weeks, Congress managers are satisfied that they have succeeded in shedding the organisational sloth. Congress chief ministers took out rallies in the five states ruled by the party last month and then the party observed its Foundation Day on December 28 by holding rallies in all states.

Visakhapatnam: Conducting classes on school holidays is detrimental to the students ’ psychological health and overall academic development, said psychologists and child rights activists from the city while adding that conducting such classes violates the children’s right of leisure.

The discussion was taking place in the context of the state government having declared Makara Sankranti holidays in state-run schools from January 11 to 20.

G Sitharam, state president of the NGO Child Rights Protection Forum said, “During the 10-day Dusara holidays, certain schools held classes, which we had brought to the notice of the district education officer (DEO). Again, during the Pongal holidays, it has come to our notice that some municipal schools at Madhuranagar, Muralinagar and Madhavdhara are trying to conduct special classes for class 10 students.”

“If we find the managements of (these) schools not implementing the education department guidelines and covertly conducting classes during holidays, we will take this issue up with the higher authorities in the education department,” Sitharam added.

Neuro-psychiatrist Dr B Ramesh Kumar said, “With children growing up in nuclear family set ups, they hardly get the opportunity to spend time with their grandparents. Sankranti is one such festival where they get to travel to their hometown. But with schools deciding to conduct classes, children lose the opportunity to rejuvenate themselves.”

Visakhapatnam: Tribals in many parts of Visakhapatnam Agency observed Bhogi on the first day of the three-day Sankranti festival by burning copies of the reservation announced for ZPTC (zilla parishad territorial constituency) and MPTC (mandal parishad territorial constituency) elections .

The tribals staged demonstrations against the district administration and the state government for reserving seats for non-tribal categories in scheduled (tribal) areas.

Representatives of the joint action committee (JAC), K Surendra, G Surayya and K Suryanarayana maintained that all ZPTC posts and MPTC posts should be reserved for tribal candidates only.

The JAC representatives feel that the state government has done injustice to tribals by allocating 10 of the 11 ZPTC seats in Visakhapatnam Agency to non-tribals.

“Despite our protest, the state government is yet to make any change in reservations for ZPTC and MPTC elections. The government and the district administration seem to be encouraging non-tribals to grab tribal land in Araku Valley, Paderu and Chintapalli,” said one of the representatives.

The protestors further said that they are going to launch a series of protests in the next few days.

According to the AP Scheduled Area Lands Transfer (Amendment) Regulation of 1970, the transfer of tribal land to non-tribals is prohibited, said one protestor while adding that the protests will continue until the government changes its mind.

NEW DELHI: India will not be like a western liberal power but as the world’s greatest democracy, is a “self-defined power” which lives with its own traditions and values and also with global aspirations, former Canadian PM Stephen Harper said at the Raisina Dialogue on Tuesday.

At the inaugural session of the annual event, India’s flagship foreign policy and strategic conversation, foreign minister S Jaishankar said the characteristics of the Dialogue mirrored Indian foreign policy. “Indian foreign policy today seeks to achieve a focus on key challenges, a broad engagement with many parties, and managing, if not leveraging, global contradictions. Advancing our interests in a multipolar world and contributing to global good is what it is all about,” he said.

The inaugural session included seven former heads of government — Caril Bildt of Sweden , Tshering Tobgay of Bhutan, Han Seung-soo of South Korea , Helen Clark of New Zealand, Anders Fogh Rasmussen of Denmark , Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and Harper of Canada — to set the scene for debating the most important questions in the world today.

Harper bluntly said it was important to change the nature of the regime in Iran for West Asia to have durable peace. On Wednesday, this position will definitely be contested by Javad Zarif, foreign minister of Iran who will speak at the Dialogue.

Harper also referred to the burgeoning political protests that have broken out in different parts of the world over inequality, nationalism etc.

Clark and Tobgay stressed on the importance of dealing with climate change as a global imperative. Tobgay said, “We need global champions,” pointing to PM Narendra Modi who attended the session but did not speak.

422,['15/01/2020'],National BJP leaders to meet Pawan in Vijaywada tomorrow,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Kakinada: Fuelling speculation of a BJP-Jana Sena alliance in Andhra Pradesh ahead of local body and municipal polls, Jana Sena president and film actor Pawan Kalyan on Tuesday announced that a meeting of Jana Sena and BJP leaders will be held in Vijayawada on January 16.

BJP’s national leaders are likely to attend the crucial meeting, four days before AP assembly session on January 20 in which chief minister and YSRCP president Y S Jaganmohan Reddy is likely to announce shifting of state capital from Amaravati.

Incidentally, BJP and Jana Sena are opposed to the three capital cities plan of the Jagan government and have categorically said Amaravati should be continued as the capital city. Pawan said the state administration should be carried out from one place while development works should be spread across regions. He also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s aspirations are not reflected in Andhra Pradesh.

Pawan, who reached Kakinada on Tuesday after holding talks with senior BJP leaders including BJP working president JP Nadda in Delhi on Monday, told reporters the proposed BJP-Jana Sena meeting in Vijayawada will discuss important issues confronting the state including the proposal to shift the state capital.

He said he had briefed Nadda on the developments in Andhra Pradesh, agitation by farmers in Amaravati and foreign investors withdrawing from the state. He said he visited Delhi only after BJP leadership invited him.

Jana Sena sources said Pawan is likely to enter into an electoral alliance with BJP in the ensuing mandal and zilla parishad and municipal polls. Local body elections are due next month while the schedule for civic body polls is yet to be announced.

The party, however, ruled out merger of Jana Sena with BJP. Incidentally, Pawan’s brother Chiranjeevi, who had floated Praja Rajyam and won a few assembly seats, later merged his party with Congress.

Pawan joining hands with BJP is likely to throw a new political equation in Andhra Pradesh. The film actor launched the party after meeting Narendra Modi before the general elections in 2014.

Though he did not contest elections then, he supported BJP-TDP alliance, which won the assembly elections. He sailed with BJP till 2017 when he pulled out of NDA accusing BJP of cheating AP on the promise of special category status.

Jana Sena contested polls in April 2019 in alliance with the Communists. Pawan lost both assembly seats he contested including one in his native place, dominated by members of his social group. Jana Sena, however, managed to win a seat. All through the campaign Pawan did not criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi or BJP, though he was critical of YSRCP and TDP.

Pawan hails from numerically strong Kapu community. If Jana Sena and BJP combine could manage to consolidate the Kapu vote bank, the new alliance may pose a political and electoral challenge to YSRCP and TDP. The Kapu community is spread across the state but it is dominant in East and West Godavari districts. Historically, the political party that had won the maximum number of seats in these districts had always formed the government.

Earlier, Pawan’s visit to Kakinada was marred by high tension in view of prohibitory orders in the town. On Sunday Jana Sena and YSRCP activists fought a pitched battle forcing the police to resort to lathicharge. Several people were injured.

NEW DELHI: At a time when online marketplaces have come under the scanner for alleged exclusive agreements with smartphone makers, top apparel and footwear brands, including Under Armour , Nike, Marks & Spencer and Adidas are moving away from such agreements.The move by these brands is an effort to reach a wider consumer base, which is not possible by being available on a single e-commerce platform. For instance, German sportswear maker Adidas, which had an exclusive tie-up with Flipkart and Myntra, has started selling on Amazon India. British retailer Marks & Spencer, which went online in India through Flipkart Group, has now moved to Amazon and Ajio as well.“It’s a strategy by any brand launching in the market to side with one strong online player.

MUMBAI: Overwhelmed with emotion, Dilip Shah clasped his mother’s chain tightly in his palm on Tuesday. The last time he had seen it was 33 years ago. His mother had been robbed of the chain while she was on her way to a temple in 1986. The case remained unsolved for long and the family stopped inquiring with the police after Shah’s mother passed away.

Last week, Shah was informed the Railway police commissioner would soon hand over the chain to him.

On Tuesday, Shah was among 104 citizens who received ornaments, money and electronics, collectively worth Rs 1 crore that had been stolen from them over the years.

“I was in my late 20s when my mother’s chain was snatched. It was around 1986. She used to wear the chain every day,” said Shah (62), a garments trader. “During her last days, my mother’s health worsened and we moved homes so we could stay closer to a Jain temple that she frequented.” Meanwhile, the police closed the case. But it was reopened for investigation subsequently. “Two years ago, the police sent a letter to our previous address. The letter said they had recovered stolen property belonging to my mother. I made several rounds of the police station and court to get it back. But it was taking too long for the court to pass an order. I even had an argument with the magistrate in open court a few months ago,” Shah said. His 93-year-old father’s eyes welled up on seeing the chain on Tuesday. The family plans to donate it to the temple.

Bhayander-based housewife Bhavna Desai, who also got her stolen gold chain back after three decades, said it was among the few pieces of ornaments she has ever owned. “My family was not well off and I had slogged to buy myself a gold chain. I was 28 years old then and my parents had fixed my marriage. While walking back home on the railway tracks at Vidyavihar, a thief came up from behind and snatched the chain. I couldn’t stop crying on reaching home and my father accompanied me to lodge a complaint,” Desai, 58, said.

Earlier this month, two cops turned up at Desai’s maternal home in Vidyavihar. “My father is no more and my mother has moved to our native place. When the cops turned up for the second time, neighbours gave them my phone number. I was overjoyed when they mentioned they had got back my stolen chain ,” said Desai. When Desai purchased the chain in the 1980s, it cost around Rs 2,500, but its value today is Rs 41,000.

Being robbed of their jewellery on a long-distance train 18 years ago was an unpleasant memory for Byculla businessman Jitendra Jain and his family. But getting all 83 gm of it back on Tuesday was a “sweet surprise”, said Jain. The family was returning from a wedding in Rajasthan in 2001 when a robber got into the train between Santacruz and Bandra. Pretending to be a government officer, he asked to check their baggage. When Jain asked him to produce his identification, the man whipped out a knife and placed it on Jain’s neck, and stripped the family of all the jewellery they were wearing. “He was caught a couple of years later and I remember identifying him at the police station. But the trial took several years and we had given up all hope of getting our ornaments back,” Jain said.

GRP commissioner Ravindra Sengaokar said they planned to return more recovered jewellery to citizens on Gudi Padwa.

(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: Real estate lobby group NAREDCO has launched the country’s first e-commerce portal, www.housingforall.com, for ready-to-move in houses which its members will upload for home buyers. The organisation said the developers will be allowed to upload the details of projects that have got occupation certificates ( OCs ) for the next one month, and then it will be open for home buyers with a 45-day sale period.

For the initial 15 days, buyers will be able to view offers and shortlist their homes and will be able to start making purchases from March 1 till March 31.

While Union housing secretary Durga Shankar Mishra used the analogy of an ecommerce giant to say this could be like the “Amazon for real estate sector”, experts were of the view that people don’t buy houses online, though the portal will help them to get all the details and work as a facilitator.

National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) claimed that builders will make the best offer to buyers and they can book directly through the portal with a payment of Rs 25,000. The booking amount will be fully refundable. It said at least 1,000 projects would be listed on this portal to give maximum option to the buyers.

Launching the portal, Mishra said, “It is a huge step for prospective home buyers. While having a discussion with the stakeholders, I told them that credibility needs to be the most important factor in this portal. If a person is willing to buy a property then location, price should be exactly what is promised on the portal.”

MUMBAI: The D B Marg police recently busted a gang that used to con people using the threat of shutting down their Paytm accounts . In a recent case, they duped a 73-year-old man from Vile Parle of Rs 1.7 lakh.

The arrested accused were identified as Narshi Sutar (23), Nandkishore Sutar (26), and Arvind Singh (27), who acted as their mentor to run the scam.

The complainant, Anil Shah, told the police that he had received a text message from a mobile number, that asked him to contact them and update his information (KYC) for his Paytm account, or the account would be closed. When Shah called the number, he was told that those who did not submit their documents and update their accounts, had their accounts shut down. Shah then shared his details. After that, Rs 1.7 lakh was debited from his account.

Shah then approached the police to lodge a complaint. While probing the case, the police found that the fraudsters had purchased six mobile phones and some vouchers from malls in the city. Based on these details, the Sutars were taken into custody from Lower Parel. During their investigation, they told the police about their 'leader', Arvind Singh.The police then picked him up from Jharkhand.

The police have recovered property worth Rs 1.2 lakh in Shah's case. They also found 70 mobile phones that they suspect the three accused had used to run their scam. The trio would get the victim's account details, hack into the account and then transfer the money to themselves. The three were remanded in police custody till January 20.

NEW DELHI: Delhi police's Special Investigation Team (SIT) has arrested 100 people in the anti-CAA riots so far, the latest being Firoz, a resident of Jafrabad. Firoz was identified from CCTV footage recovered during the protests. A probe is on to establish whether the same men were involved in the riots at Jamia and Daryaganj. The SIT took up the probe of the Jamia Nagar and Daryaganj violence recently.

The SIT led by DCP (crime) Rajesh Deo had suspected the role of at least 15 people based on the footage and technical evidence recovered from the scene of riot, among whom Firoz was found to be leading a mob from the front.

In the Seelampur riots, the cops had arrested 16 people from the ground, while two others were caught during the investigation. The SIT took over the probe of the riots at Jamia Nagar last week and interrogated the six people who were arrested earlier, which led them to two more men who were seen pelting stones at the buses on Mathura Road.

429,['15/01/2020'],Boosting consumption a must to get investment moving: Reddy,"This story is from January 15, 2020

(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: The government needs to focus on spurring consumption through a stimulus to get companies to invest as the reduction in corporation tax alone is not enough to prompt industry to invest, the newly-elected president of industry lobby group Ficci said on Tuesday.

“Number one to pump prime the economy, we need to infuse capital, which is needed to spur consumption. Unless you spur consumption, you cannot catalyse investment. It’s becoming like chicken and egg. People are saying that we have lowered taxes but people are booking those taxes and not spending,” Sangita Reddy, who is also the joint managing director of Apollo Hospitals , told TOI in an interview. “Corporations will not spend it on growth unless they know there is consumption. It’s very critical to put money into the system,” said Reddy.

Presenting a comprehensive blueprint for boosting overall growth ahead of the February 1 Budget, Reddy said the focus must now shift to exports as well as the crucial agriculture sector, including large scale mechanisation and value addition.

Expressing confidence about achieving the $5 trillion target, Reddy said the government and industry must work together as partners to ensure that the target is achieved.

She said the government should not worry about the fiscal deficit target and instead focus on boosting consumption. This, she said, could be done by pumping around Rs 1.5 lakh crore to Rs 2 lakh crore in the economy, particularly in rural areas.

“We have recommended that the government should raise Rs 1.5-2 lakh crore, whether from RBI or bonds, and not worry about fiscal deficit. But use the money to put it directly into the hands of rural India or in areas,” she said.

“In the same breath, create a time-bound plan for disinvestment of around Rs 3 lakh crore so that if both happen in synchrony with each other, and this is well articulated, there will be no reduction in our rating and the fiscal deficit will bloat only for a temporary period,” Reddy said.

She said the government must turn its focus on shoring up growth, which is estimated to slow to an 11-year low of 5%.

“Let’s make 2020 the year of economic growth and economic focus. The potential is huge and industry and government intend to work together to fulfil this potential,” Reddy said.

430,['15/01/2020'],Merc eyes ‘sustainable luxury’ with 10 new EVs by 2022,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Pune: Mercedes-Benz is developing at least 10 new pure electric cars that will hit global markets by 2022. The German automaker’s R&D unit in Bengaluru is already active in contributing to the development of these new generation cars, at least some of which are expected to make it to the Indian market.

Speaking on the sidelines of the unveiling Mercedes-Benz EQC, its first pure electric global car in India, the automaker’s India MD & CEO Martin Schwenk said the electric SUV would test the market and gauge customer response before the company decided to introduce more electric cars in India.

“The sporty SUV is an entry into the electric space but it isn’t a car for everyone. We are still trying to understand what will work in the Indian market and what won’t. There is strong government focus towards introduction of electric cars. Customer and dealer interest is also picking up. But infrastructure hasn’t changed yet. So we are looking at electric cars that can do 470-500km to a charge,” said Schwenk.

The luxury carmaker is positioning its electric portfolio EQC as sustainable luxury. “Just as Mercedes-Benz stands for modern luxury, Mercedes-Maybach for ultimate luxury and Mercedes-AMG for driving performance, EQC is pointing the way to the future and part of Mercedes-Benz’s philosophy of sustainable luxury,” the CEO explained.

The EQC, to be launched in April 2020, will be among 10 cars that the company plans to introduce during the year. The new GLE will be launched on January 20, the new GLS in the second quarter of the year. The rapid introduction of products is aimed at keeping the excitement going in the market, a critical factor in driving sales when the market is depressed.

Though Mercedes-Benz recorded the highest ever fourth quarter sales in 2019, it was owing to six new launches and a bonanza offer to GLE and GLS customers that allowed free upgrades. Overall, sales dipped by 11% during the year but the carmaker managed to increase its marketshare in the luxury segment from 37.5% in 2018 to 41% in 2019.

Schwenk is cautiously optimistic about the year ahead and hopes the numbers will be close to 2018 when the company sold 15,538 cars (sales dipped to 13,786 units in 2019). He also sees that the industry make a turnaround.

“The uncertainty over BS IV to BS VI migration that has seen many companies cut production and take measures to reduce BS IV inventory will be over and companies can focus on growth. At Mercedes-Benz, there is actual customer movement is showrooms. I see positive signs,” he added.

431,['15/01/2020'],Bengal beats big states in curbing retail inflation,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Kolkata: West Bengal has done well in containing retail inflation in December compared to most other big states of the country. The state’s retail inflation in the last month stood at 7.53%, which is slightly more that the national average but lower than seven major states. Inflation figure in some states peaked as high as 9.61%.

Economists feel that the Bengal’s number is largely due to better vegetable production and distribution system with relatively lower mark up than the previous years. The other seven states where retail inflation as per the latest figure was higher are: Odisha (9.41%), Telengana (9.39%), UP (8.92%), Tamil Nadu (8.64%), Kerala (7.98%), MP (7.88%), Uttarakhand (7.82%).

Owing to higher food prices, India’s retail inflation rose sharply to 7.35% in December 2019 from 5.54% in November, according to the government data. The retail inflation in December was highest in six years. It was 2.11% in December 2018. Apart from Kerala and Uttarakhand, all the other states in this chart are bigger in terms of size though West Bengal population is higher than most of these states.

Vegetables inflation in December 2019 surged to 60.5% as against 36% in November. As per the government data, the food inflation rose to 14.12% in December as against (-) 2.65% in the same month of 2018. It was 10.01% in November 2019. The central government has mandated the Reserve Bank of India to keep inflation in the range of 4% with a margin of 2% on the either side. Citing inflation concerns, the RBI kept interest rates unchanged in December following five cuts totaling 135 basis points earlier in the year.

Leading economists had attributed this phenomenon to vegetable prices because as per the available data it was the single largest contributor to this high retail inflation. Professor of Economics in ISI, Abhirup Sarkar pointed out that West Bengal is known for its variety of vegetables and volume of vegetable production. “This distribution system too may be little better here so that price spiral is less compared to may be some other states,” he added. Sources close to NSSO pointed out that as per its later report (not yet public), the rural consumption has not gone down like what has happened nationally.

Former head of ISI, Dipankar Dasgupta feels that historically vegetable supply in Bengal is better and the number of organised market is also more. Sources in state government argued that in last 5-6 years, it has constructed Krishi Baazar (rural procurement centres) some of which are operational, might have helped.

Nagpur: Leaked CCTV footage of Angad Singh’s murder at Saoner on Sunday by his friend-turned-foe Narendra Singh, already under arrest, left the rural police red-faced, forcing them to arrest one more person in the case. On Tuesday, Saoner police of Nagpur rural arrested Vikas Bhagotiya after his presence at the crime scene became apparent in the CCTV footage.

Saoner police had earlier arrested only Narendra for repeatedly assaulting Angad with a sharp weapon, causing his death. The two apparently had an old business rivalry. The probe by Saoner police was slow paced after procuring Narendra’s custody remand for five days.

In the meantime, a 2.17 minute CCTV footage was leaked, and went viral, exposing the presence of several persons at the murder spot apart from Narendra. Though their complicity in the murder is not yet clear, police have arrested Bhagotiya, as he was seen helping Narendra free himself from the grip of some others apparently trying to stop him.

Bhagotiya, on another occasion in the footage, can be seen pushing away another person trying to dissuade Narendra as he was repeatedly assaulting Angad.

Saoner police, based on the footage, have also recorded the statement of two other persons, Sagar Saoji and Chandu Karadikar, who were also present at the murder spot. Karadikar was seen hurling a stone towards Narendra. During questioning, Karadikar claimed he hurled the stone to distract Narendra, who was assaulting Angad.

Unknown voices in the background of the clip can be heard repeatedly referring to Bhagotiya and Saoji.

Though Saoji too was seen running helter skelter at the murder spot, cops are not sure about his role. He was also seen escorting a profusely bleeding Angad away from the spot at the end of the clip. Sources said Saoji was the common friend between Angad and Narendra.

Senior PI Ashok Koli of Saoner police station said the investigation is underway and more developments are likely in the case. “We are thoroughly probing from all angles,” he said.

434,['15/01/2020'],South Bombay tops in cases of neglect by children,"Representative image

Most parents deserted or not paid maintenance

MUMBAI: A total of 592 senior citizens from Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai filed complaints of neglect against their children under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act ever since the legislation was enacted in 2007, statistics reveal. A majority of the cases (289) were from South Mumbai, while 195 were from suburban Mumbai and 108 from Thane district, of which Navi Mumbai is a part.South Mumbai has in recent years seen the highest migration to the suburbs and even abroad, “which primarily appears to be affecting the life of senior citizens as younger couples who migrate might be leaving elderly parents in SoBo homes without proper care,” said Prof Arokia Samy, head of department of development studies with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS).Most cases under the Act are about desertion of parents by children who live elsewhere, non-allocation of maintenance or neglect after having usurped their properties. Collector for South Mumbai Shivaji Jondhale said lack of maintenance was a major reason cited by elders, followed by absence of provision of paramedic staff or servants and misbehaviour.The Act states it is mandatory for children to spend 5% of their income on maintenance of their parents, besides employing servants (paramedics) to take care of them, suburban collector Milind Borikar, who has quasi-judicial powers to decide cases under the law, said.But cases of neglect are numerous. In one case, a widow was detected with cancer in 2018 and the same year, thrown out of her home by her only son. The woman, who sought justice under the Act by approaching the deputy collector, with whom complaints have to be lodged, used to stay in a flat owned by her in Koparkhairane, while her son, who worked in a Dubai firm, stayed with his family in Thane. The son was an alcoholic and later lost his money. He requested his mother to allow him and his family to stay in her flat and later got it transferred in his name through a gift deed on the sly. “He never paid rent or looked after me. Later, he evicted me from my home and tried to sell off the property,” the woman told the panel hearing her case. The authorities heard both sides and ruled in her favour. “She not only got her home back but her son was made to pay Rs 5,000 as maintenance,” said a home department official.The Bombay high court in 2018 ruled that elderly parents can take back a share in property given to a son/daughter as a gift if they fail to look after them or harass them.

Most parents deserted or not paid maintenance

MUMBAI: A total of 592 senior citizens from Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai filed complaints of neglect against their children under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act ever since the legislation was enacted in 2007, statistics reveal. A majority of the cases (289) were from South Mumbai, while 195 were from suburban Mumbai and 108 from Thane district, of which Navi Mumbai is a part.South Mumbai has in recent years seen the highest migration to the suburbs and even abroad, “which primarily appears to be affecting the life of senior citizens as younger couples who migrate might be leaving elderly parents in SoBo homes without proper care,” said Prof Arokia Samy, head of department of development studies with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS).Most cases under the Act are about desertion of parents by children who live elsewhere, non-allocation of maintenance or neglect after having usurped their properties. Collector for South Mumbai Shivaji Jondhale said lack of maintenance was a major reason cited by elders, followed by absence of provision of paramedic staff or servants and misbehaviour.The Act states it is mandatory for children to spend 5% of their income on maintenance of their parents, besides employing servants (paramedics) to take care of them, suburban collector Milind Borikar, who has quasi-judicial powers to decide cases under the law, said.But cases of neglect are numerous. In one case, a widow was detected with cancer in 2018 and the same year, thrown out of her home by her only son. The woman, who sought justice under the Act by approaching the deputy collector, with whom complaints have to be lodged, used to stay in a flat owned by her in Koparkhairane, while her son, who worked in a Dubai firm, stayed with his family in Thane. The son was an alcoholic and later lost his money. He requested his mother to allow him and his family to stay in her flat and later got it transferred in his name through a gift deed on the sly. “He never paid rent or looked after me. Later, he evicted me from my home and tried to sell off the property,” the woman told the panel hearing her case. The authorities heard both sides and ruled in her favour. “She not only got her home back but her son was made to pay Rs 5,000 as maintenance,” said a home department official.The Bombay high court in 2018 ruled that elderly parents can take back a share in property given to a son/daughter as a gift if they fail to look after them or harass them.

MUMBAI: An assistant manager employed with an international trading firm was duped of Rs 20,000 after she scanned a QR code provided to her to make a payment on an online payment platform.

Pradeep Sinha, CEO of Inditech International, asked Navita Telang to place an ad to sell five ACs for Rs 45,000 on an online marketplace around 12.30pm on Monday. Sinha said the fraud occurred between 12.30pm and 1pm on Monday. In her complaint, Telang said, “I got a call from a Anil Sharma, who wanted to buy the ACs. He said he would pay Rs 45,000 in two transactions of Rs 20,000 and Rs 25,000.”

Sinha said the fraudster gained Telang’s confidence by transferring Rs 5 to her account via an online payment platform. “He sent a QR code for Rs 19,999. As soon as she scanned it, the amount was debited from her bank account,” he said.

When Sinha sent a few employees to check Sharma’s reported address, at Radhakrishna Apartments in Andheri (east), they found that the address was fake. “When our people visited the address, the people in the society said that no one by that name resides there. It seems like he is a professional criminal,” said Sinha.

Telang said that when she approached the Amboli police to lodge a complaint, they took more than four hours to file an FIR — time that could have been spent looking for the fraudster. The Amboli police sought details from the payment platform and the bank to get to the money trail, to find the account the money was credited to. A case under the Indian Penal Code for cheating and impersonation has been registered.

A video grab of NCP corporator Kaptan Malik slapping a contract worker employed with a power company at Kurla ... Read More

MUMBAI: A video of NCP corporator Kaptan Malik, brother of cabinet minister Nawab Malik, hurling abuses and slapping contract workers repairing the network of a private power company at Kurla in December, has gone viral on social media. Police are yet to register a case.

While the opposition and netizens have demanded action against the corporator for 'abuse of power', Malik justified his act saying that he assaulted the workers ""in public interest"".

He claimed he had complained to BMC on several occasions about power supply and fibre optics companies carrying out work on roads dug up for repair and reconstruction without permission. ""These companies cause the BMC loss of thousands of crores as they have to pay a fee to dig up roads. In this case, I had warned the workers the previous day against carrying out the work. When I saw them back at the site the next day, I assaulted them.""

Civic officials confirmed that they had not issued any permission to the power supply company for the work at Kurla, but refused comment when asked why they did not take action against the power firm.

Demanding action against Mailk BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said: ""If the work was being carried out without permission, BMC should take action against the company's contractor; who is Kaptan Malik to assault the workers? He is trying to create terror among contractors for ulterior motives. The government should take criminal action.""

Advocate Gayatri Singh said, ""The company should file an FIR against corporator for assaulting workers. If the corporator felt that the work was being carried out illegally, he could have approached the authority concerned to stop the work. He cannot beat workers; what example is he setting?""

Jagdeep Dhankhar

KOLKATA: Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has followed in the footsteps of senior BJP leaders, claiming that Arjun’s arrows had “nuc-lear powers” and there were “udaan khatolas (flying machines)” in the Ramayana.

Dhankhar chose the inauguration of a science and engineering fair at the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum in south Kolkata to drop the N-bomb on an unsuspecting audience. “The plane was (invented) in 1910 or 1911. But ... if you delve into our old scriptures … in the Ramayana, we had this udaan khatola (flying machine). And, in the Mahabharata , we had a situation where Sanjay narrated everything and not from the (battle)field. We had those arrows of Arjun which had nuclear power,” Dhankhar said on Tuesday. He then stressed: “The world can no longer afford to ignore India. I cannot.”

Several BJP leaders have preceded Dhankhar in seeing science in the Indian epics and traditional beliefs. Tripura’s BJP CM, Biplab Deb, brought up the Sanjay parallel in April 2018, when he said the internet existed in the days of the Mahabharata as well. “Sanjay was blind but he narrated what was happening on the battlefield to Dhritarashtra anyway. This was due to internet and technology. Satellites also existed during that period,” Deb had said.

And Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh claimed in November 2019 that “research had showed” that cow’s milk contained gold.

Dhankhar has been repeatedly accused by the Bengal government and Trinamool Congress seniors of “acting on behalf of the BJP”. The Bengal governor is also the chancellor of the state’s universities (though a new law enacted by the state higher education department late last year has curbed much of those powers).

Educationists, however, expressed shock and dismay at the chancellor’s comments.

Eminent physicist and former Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP) director Bikash Sinha described Dhankhar’s remark as “irresponsible, senseless and irrelevant”. “He has lost his mind. The governor should first read a bit of history and try to find out about the development of nuclear weapons in India. Then he should realise that the people of Bengal cannot be fooled by such baseless remarks. The ordinary middle-class and even the lower-middle-class people of our state are educated enough to know that nuclear weapons did not exist then. They will never believe or pay heed to such unscientific observations,” Sinha said.

He went on to add that such irresponsible comments would cost the governor his credibility. “So far we have heard similar remarks from some union ministers. Now, Dhankhar has jumped on to the bandwagon, which is unfortunate. He risks becoming a butt of jokes by making such comments,” Sinha added.

A senior scientist with a leading (central government) science research organisation said he was shocked and surprised by the governor’s observations. “Did flying machines and nuclear weapons exist in the age of the puranas? I think it is both sad and funny that we are having to discuss this. If someone tells me that they really did, my reaction would be, ‘Oh, really?’,” he said.

Presidency University emeritus professor of sociology Prasanta Ray felt that the comments were consistent with the BJP’s agenda of glorifying India’s past as part of its Hindutva agenda. “There is no evidence that science and technology had progressed thus in ancient India. The question that needs to be asked is that, if they did, then why did we have to learn and adopt science from others. The BJP’s explanation would be that Muslim invasion destroyed it all. But historical or archaeological facts do not corroborate that either,” Ray said.

Kolkata: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh’s recent “beat them, shoot them” remark against Bangladeshi infiltrators may have ruffled feathers, but that seems to be the saffron party’s way on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens. According to BJP insiders, the 31 zilla presidents and another 31 Pradesh Pratinidhi Sadasyas of the total 49 organisational districts are likely to re-elect Ghosh for a second term on Thursday.

The Bengal BJP is preparing party ranks for a “do or die” mission on the new law, anticipating stiff resistance from Trinamool Congress and other forces at the ground level. BJP leaders have made it loud and clear that Bengali Hindus and Muslims who are Indian citizens have nothing to worry. They are after the infiltrators (Muslims) from Bangladesh, which explains Ghosh’s vitriolic speeches.

State BJP leaders have taken note of the long queues at voting centres for inclusion of fresh names and the rising number of affidavits. “Mark the queues in Murshidabad’s Domkal and the number of affidavits in Basirhat court. They speak for our cause,” a BJP state office-bearer said. BJP leaders are marking time for the Supreme Court to hear out the petitions against CAA-NRC on January 22.

Unlike in Assam, the Narendra Modi government has no ‘Plan B’ for Bengal to customise CAA with the ground reality in the state where most migrants have already obtained ration cards, Aadhaar cards and have their names enrolled in the voters’ list.

BJP organisers are set to reach out to mohallas from January-end on a 1-crore signature campaign in support of CAA. Bengal BJP is likely to take stock of its position in refugee-dominated areas of North 24 Parganas, Nadia and parts of Howrah where its organisational strength is still no match for TMC.

BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu didn’t want to go into the numbers game. Neither is the state BJP willing to take note of students’ protests against CAA. “We are confident that majority Bengali Hindus and particularly the refugees are with us even in places where we don’t have a strong network,” Basu said.

Malda/Kolkata: The CID brass remained tightlipped on whether investigators have zeroed in on at least five security personnel who need to be “further investigated” before ruling out their involvement in the violence at Sujapur in Malda during last Wednesday’s bandh.

Police said this includes one RAF personal, two from the battalion and two civic volunteers. The Malda DDI unit of CID has informed headquarters in Kolkata about their findings.

CID last Thursday took over the investigation. At least seven persons have been arrested and raids are on to identify more.

Hundreds of people had allegedly attacked police with bricks, ransacked buses and police vehicles to enforce the strike, a senior CID official said. CID sources claimed video footage analysis and statements recorded from various sources form the basis of their findings. A departmental inquiry has also been initiated against the policemen, who were purportedly seen vandalizing cars near Sujapur bus stand.

Another legend is about the third day of Pongal. On this day Mahadev sent his vahana, Nandi who was a bull to tell people to have oil bath daily and have food once a month. He told people the opposite, to eat daily and have an oil bath once a month. This enraged Lord Shiva and he ordered Nandi to stay on earth and help humans in harvesting the crops so that they could eat daily.The first day is celebrated in the honour of Indra. People burn useless household items in the bonfire. A special ritual is followed on the second day which is dedicated to the Sun God. The traditional sweet dish ‘pongal’ is made under the sun in an earthen pot. It has rice and lentils which are boiled in milk and jaggery. It is then offered to the Sun God. The third day is for the cattles. They are given a bath and then decorated with garlands, bells and are worshipped. As a part of the festival bull fights are also organized.

444,['15/01/2020'],"Ground executive at Kolkata airport refuses wheelchair, airline says sorry","Mamta and Tolaram being assured of help by a senior SpiceJet executive at the airport on Tuesday

KOLKATA: A spinal patient travelling to Coimbatore for surgery on low-cost carrier SpiceJet was refused a wheelchair by an airline executive at the Kolkata airport’s check-in counter on Tuesday. All pleas and arguments by Mamta Agarwala — who was plainly in discomfort — and her husband fell on deaf ears.Even efforts by other passengers to make the airline staff see reason failed. It was only when the matter was brought to the notice of the airport director that Mamta was issued a wheelchair. Later, a SpiceJet spokesperson issued a statement saying “any shortcoming is deeply regretted”.Mamta’s airport trauma began around 10.15am, when she and her husband, Tolaram, arrived at departure gate 2A. When she inquired about a wheelchair, the CISF personnel at the gate told her she would have to make the request at the SpiceJet counter. Leaning on a luggage trolley for support, she made her way to the portal that has SpiceJet counters. There, she was directed to counter No. 15.When she made the request at the counter, the executive said it wouldn’t be possible. “Why did you not make the request at the time of booking the tickets? It is not possible to get a wheelchair now,” the executive reportedly told Mamta.Even when Tolaram pointed out that she had problems in her spine and was travelling to Ganga Hospital in Coimbatore for an operation scheduled on Thursday, the airline staff allegedly refused to budge.At this point, a passenger who was in queue behind the couple stepped in and requested the airline staff to set aside formalities and provide a wheelchair as it was clear that the passenger was in distress and needed it. He also pointed to over a dozen wheelchairs stacked next to counter 16, barely 10 metres away. But the airline staff allegedly remained adamant and maintained the wheelchairs were for passengers who had pre-booked them.“Get in touch with the call centre and make your request. I will not be able to provide wheelchair assistance. Please step aside and don’t waste my time,” the Spicejet executive reportedly Mamta. Another passenger awaiting his turn to check called up the airport director’s office. Within a couple of minutes, a senior airline executive arrived at the spot and said she would immediately arrange for a wheelchair. She also profusely apologised to the Agarwalas for the problem they had to face.“We don’t want your apology. You have not done anything. We want staff at the check-in counters to display more empathy. It is she who should be told not to behave in this manner,” a pained Mamta Agarwala told the senior executive. But no apology was forthcoming from the staff member at the check-in counter.Mamta later told TOI that the gap between two of her vertebrae had reduced, affecting the nerve. “I cannot stand or walk for long. Had I known that the wheelchair needed to be pre-booked, I would have surely done so. But refusing to provide it despite seeing my condition was unfortunate,” she said.A SpiceJet spokesperson said the incident would be investigated and appropriate action taken: “As per Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) Section 3 — Air Transport Series M Part I ISSUE III dated February 28, 2014, a wheelchair has to be pre-booked 48 hours before a flight. It is provided free of cost by the airline. Pre-booking is encouraged to ensure there is no shortage of wheelchairs for passengers and prompt service by our ground staff. That said, every effort is made by the airline to provide a wheelchair to passengers who need one and ask for it at the check-in counter. The staff is always encouraged to go out of its way and serve passengers, especially senior citizens, and any shortcoming is deeply regretted.”Tuesday’s incident highlights a recurring problem at Kolkata airport. Though the airport operator has tried to facilitate ease of travel for passengers with reduced mobility, wheelchairs — the most basic facility for such passengers — is still a problem. Airlines are responsible for providing wheelchairs to passengers. While they do so at other airports, carriers have somehow been unable to put things in order in Kolkata.Though there is wheelchair assistance booths at the entrance, Mamta — like many others before her — have been asked to walk to the airline counter for one. The situation turns worse for those travelling late at night, as services are often neglected at those hours. With a large number of non-resident Indians — many of them senior citizens — travelling to and from Kolkata during winter, wheelchair availability, or the lack of it, is a major issue at Kolkata airport.Last October, disability rights advocate Jeeja Ghosh had faced a similar problem with GoAir while travelling to Delhi to attend an international conference. Following the incident, airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee had organized a sensitisation programme in partnership with the UK deputy high commission, led by Ghosh. Airports Authority of India employees, staff of various airlines as well as CISF personnel attended the two-day workshop.“We are trying to make the airport customer-friendly and improve access to those with mobility issues. While we have made several changes in the infrastructure, it is the mindset change that we are trying to address now. The incident goes to only show that we have to travel a distance yet,” Bhattacharjee admitted.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73261423,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-707388,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ground-exec-at-airport-refuses-wheelchair-airline-says-sorry/articleshow/73259788.cms

NEW DELHI: In a first for the country, employees of two essential services — Delhi Metro and Northern Railway Transportation services — as well as mediapersons covering poll day activities with authorisation from Election Commission will have the option of voting by postal ballot in the Delhi assembly poll.

The Election Commission, in a notification issued on January 10, said that it had, on due consideration of the matter and in consultation with the central government, decided that persons employed in Delhi Metro, Northern Railway Transportation (Passenger & Freight) Services and mediapersons covering the poll day activities, “who on account of being on duty on the day of polling....will not be able to be present in their respective polling station”, can vote by postal ballot in Delhi poll due on February 8.

The facility is being extended in accordance with an amendment effected in the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, by the Centre in October last year on EC’s recommendation. The amendment allowed senior citizens above 80 years of age, disabled persons and those employed in essential services, e.g. railways, state transport and aviation, etc, the option of voting from home using the postal ballot facility.

The commission has written to the Delhi chief electoral officer asking him to notify the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and Northern Railway and request them to appoint ‘nodal officers’ for the purpose of rolling out postal ballot facility. “The nodal officer may be briefed about the facility and responsibilities and duties to be carried out by him/her. Copies of 12D may be made available to the nodal officer. Nodal officer should inform electors concerned about the facility,” the poll panel said in a communication to Delhi CEO.

NAVI MUMBAI: Two days after more than 700 trees were cut on a Palm Beach Road plot , the City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra Ltd ( Cidco ) said they had not broken any law while giving approval to chop down the trees.However, city environmentalists are planning contempt of court proceedings against Cidco and a private builder as the largescale axing took place even though a case is pending in Supreme Court.The Cidco Public Relations Officer (PRO) stated, ""With regard to the cutting of trees, we are clarifying pockets D and E of Nerul, sector 60, were not subject matter of the Bombay high court litigation in writ petition number 218 of 2016. So there is no restraining order against Cidco. Cidco is a planning authority as well as the Tree Authority for the designated area. Tree officer of Cidco has given permission (to cut trees) following due procedure.""However, environmentalist Sunil Agarwal, claimed the entire integrated complex of the proposed golf course and 17 residential towers is divided into five pockets. ""Cidco and the private builder have been trying to break this integrated project into different pockets to exploit the real estate without first working on the golf course, which was the primary objective. In the past, too, they tried to mislead by claiming pockets D and E were a separate project, but environment clearance was withheld after our representation before a government committee.""Agarwal said the matter is in court because of the presence of wetlands, which are part of the National Wetlands inventory and protected by an SC order of October 2017.",navi-mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73261227,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-595624,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/700-trees-cut-cidco-says-no-rules-flouted-greens-cry-foul/articleshow/73261192.cms

NEW DELHI: Maintaining its momentum for the assembly elections, Aam Aadmi Party has been first off the blocks in declaring its candidates. On Tuesday, it named candidates for all 70 constituencies in Delhi, which will go to the polls on February 8.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will contest from New Delhi while deputy CM Manish Sisodia will be fielded from Patparganj with both having represented their constituencies since 2013.AAP released the list after a marathon meeting of the party's highest decision-making body, the political affairs committee. It has re-fielded 46 of the 61 sitting MLAs and included 20 new faces besides three in the ones held by BJP. For one BJP-held seat, Mustafabad, the old candidate has been repeated.The party has repeated all the sitting ministers in the Arvind Kejriwal cabinet. The outcome of the elections will be known on February 11.Senior AAP members Raghav Chadha, Atishi and Dilip Pandey, who had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, have been fielded from Rajinder Nagar, Kalkaji and Timarpur, respectively. ""Best wishes to all. Don't be complacent. Work very hard. People have lot of faith in AAP and you. God bless,"" Kejriwal tweeted in a message to his candidates.AAP had formed the government with outside support of Congress in 2013 but resigned after just 49 days. It stormed back to office in 2015 with 67 seats. It lost the Rajouri Garden seat to BJP in a 2017 bypoll, and towards the end of 2019, five MLAs – Kapil Mishra, Sandeep Kumar, Alka Lamba, Anil Bajpai and Devinder Sehrawat – were disqualified under the anti-defection law. BJP had four seats in the outgoing assembly.Party functionaries believe that the release of the list by AAP when other parties were still in the process of deciding their candidates shows the party’s confidence. The list contains several names that have recently switched over to AAP from Congress and BSP. Five-time MLA from Matia Mahal Shoaib Iqbal, former MLA from Badarpur Ram Singh Netaji, and former Congress leader Parlad Singh Sawhney, who had won from Chandni Chowk in 1998, 2003, 2008 and 2013 before losing in 2015, have been fielded from their strongholds. The AAP list also contains names of some businessmen.Labour minister Gopal Rai has been fielded from Babarpur, social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam from Seemapuri, transport minister Kailash Gahlot from Najafgarh, health minister Satyendar Jain from Shakur Basti and Imran Hussain from Ballimaran.The MLA from Dwarka, Adarsh Shastri — grandson of former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri — has been dropped along with 15 other MLAs. After working in different MNCs for years, Shastri had left his high-paying job to join AAP with a mission to change politics and espoused the values of transparency and probity. He won from Dwarka with a big margin in 2015.AAP has replaced Shastri with Vinay Kumar Mishra, the son of former Congress MP Mahabal Mishra, who joined AAP on Monday. Vinay Mishra had contested the 2013 assembly election from Palam but could get only around 19,500 votes and lost badly.Many among the dropped MLAs expressed disappointment with the decision of the party. Badarpur MLA Narayan Dutt Sharma has turned a rebel. Sharma launched a scathing attack on Kejriwal and senior leader Manish Sisodia who, he alleged, “have accepted Rs 20 crore in exchange for the induction of Ram Singh Netaji who has been fielded from Badarpur seat.” Neither AAP, nor Netaji reacted to the allegations.Sharma toldhe will contest as an independent while a couple of other MLAs who have been dropped said that they will seek the opinion of the people of their constituencies before taking a decision whether they should contest as independents or not. Some of the more bitter ones said that work had not been a criterion for dropping them.According to party sources, the tickets have been finalized in keeping with the outcome of multiple qualitative and quantitative surveys conducted in all assembly constituencies. AAP assessed performance, public connect and opinion, and winnability of each MLA through the surveys which were conducted by the party and private agencies.Seeking re-election in Delhi, AAP is pitching the performance of its government and its achievements to outmanoeuvre rivals BJP and Congress in a three-cornered contest. The elections are critical for AAP because it does not have a significant presence outside Delhi except in Punjab. It has devised a catchy slogan — ‘— and a report card to woo voters.The pivot to AAP’s carefully crafted approach is Kejriwal, who has undergone a significant image transition in the past seven months. Known as an agitationist, Kejriwal has supported the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens from a distance.

Work hasn't been carried out systematically.” Om Prakash will make his displeasure known on February 8, no doubt.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73261308,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-677349,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/voters-got-power-water-what-more-do-we-need/articleshow/73261337.cms

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party is betting big on three faces who had unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha poll. This is also an attempt by the party to capitalise on the popularity the trio got during the parliamentary elections.While Raghav Chadha has been fielded from Rajendra Nagar, where he was born, Atishi , who was born in a Punjabi family from Delhi, has been fielded from Kalkaji .

These include providing quality education, healthcare, safe and free drinking water, and ensuring a sustained development of the area.

492,['15/01/2020'],Onion Price in Kolkata: Onion price dips below government subsidy rate in West Bengal,"Representative image

Times View Prices going back to normal will come as a huge relief. But the factors that have led to the last few weeks’ problems need to be studied so that they can be preempted if possible.

KOLKATA: The onion retail price on Tuesday dropped to Rs 50 per kg — the price prevailed just before the festive season in September. The price, which ‘burnt a hole in pockets’ back then, is now thought to be a respite. The onion price is expected to plunge further with Bengal’s own production hitting the market shortly.The wholesale rate shows the trend of price plunge accurately. The onion price in wholesale market ranged between Rs 900 and Rs 1,400 per 40 kg bag, (Rs 22.5-Rs35 per kg). The supply from Nashik (Maharastra) and Bellary (Karnataka) has steadied and changed the game, said Kamal De, the president of the West Bengal Vegetables Vendors Association.On Tuesday, the bigger variety of onion was sold at Rs 55 per kg while the medium-size onion was priced at Rs 50 per kg. “With the supply stabilising, the price of onion is likely to dip in next two-three days. The demand-supply gap had widened and pushed up the price abnormally, with number of onion-laden trucks falling down to twothree from 45-50 on an average weekday. On Tuesday, 35 trucks reached Bengal's two major wholesale hubs — Posta and Sealdah.However, some retailers at some city markets refused to pass on the benefit to consumers. At Gariahat market, onion price hovered around Rs 60-70 per kg. The wholesalers said that selling onion at Rs 60 and beyond is unethical now and the government must intervene. In fact, the retail price should not exceed Rs 40 per kg, said market experts.On December 4 and 5, onion prices hit the Rs 150-Rs 160 mark. The prices remained unchanged over the next few days, forcing the government to sell onion at a highly subsidized rate (Rs 59 per kg) through its network of 932 ration shops in Kolkata.“I had stopped selling onion the moment it crossed Rs 110 per kg. Today, I resumed the sale of onion. We think onion prices will dip further in next two-three days,” said Sujit Ghosh, a retailer at Behala Purono Bazar.""I had cut down on consumption by one-tenth to strike a budgetary balance. Now, we can think of bringing back the appropriate proportion of onion in our daily dishes,"" said Rittika Guha, a Behala homemaker.But the rise and fall of onion prices seem to be the most dramatic since September 11, when it breached the Rs50 per kg mark. ""After a gap of four months, onion prices swung back to the pre-festive period. Today, I sold onion at Rs 50 per kg. Onions just flew off my basket. People had reduced onion consumption to strike a balance in the kitchen economics,"" said Bhola Saha, an onion seller at Lake Market.Times ViewPrices going back to normal will come as a huge relief.

Sri Gururaghavendra Sahakara Bank Niyamitha

BENGALURU: Anxious customers lined up before Sri Gururaghavendra Sahakara Bank Niyamitha in Basavanagudi on Tuesday as officials remained tightlipped about the future course of action following the Reserve Bank India cap on withdrawals at Rs 35,000.

Many senior citizens demanded that the management explain why things had come to such a pass. A meeting called by the bank on Monday was postponed to January 19 abruptly. The bank chief adviser did not respond to calls and messages from TOI. Bank president K Ramakrishna told media they have spoken to RBI officials and will sort out the problem soon. Every customer will get his/her money back and the cap will be removed, he added.

Usha Devi NV, 62, said she desperately needs a job as her savings were locked in the bank. “I worked as a private firm secretary. Four years ago, I deposited Rs 8 lakh in the bank and depended on the interest of around Rs 8,000. My husband has a back injury and been advised not to ride. We don’t have children or anyone to help us,” she said.

494,['15/01/2020'],Kolkata: KMDA to float tenders for new Circular Canal bridge,"Circular Canal, over which the new bridge has been proposed

KOLKATA: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority ( KMDA ) has planned to set up a new bridge over Circular Canal , moving parallel to the RG Kar bridge that would have a ramp to lead vehicles towards Chitpore or Kolkata station. The authorities have prepared the design of the proposed bridge and plan to float tenders soon.Last year, KMDA came up with the plan to have a new canal bridge that would connect Canal West Road and Kolkata Station Road to reduce traffic load on RG Kar bridge, also known as Gaznavi Bridge that connects Shyambazar with Belgachhia.KMDA sources said that topographical and soil surveys have been conducted in the proposed area. “The proposed bridge will help divert vehicles across the canal to Shyambazar or Belgachhia. It would also help decongest RG Kar Road and reduce load on RG Kar bridge,” an official said.There will also be a 300-metre grade-separating ramp from the bridge that would come down towards Kolkata station.The structural health audit of RG Kar bridge revealed that its condition was stable, but its load-bearing capacity had reduced. Additional bitumen layers from the bridge’s surface will be removed to reduce the extra load. “This will be done before PWD starts dismantling the Tallah bridge, as RG Kar bridge will then have to take immense vehicular pressure,” an official said.The authorities recently conducted repairs on the Chitpore circular canal bridge , but the Chitpore rail yard bridge is in poor shape. Experts said that the bridge is beyond long-term repairs and could be dismantled soon. Both the bridges will start taking additional vehicular pressure once Tallah bridge demolition starts.The authorities are also working on plans to set up three bridges over the canal that flows at Julpia on the southern fringes of the city this year.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73261419,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-838181,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-kmda-to-float-tenders-for-new-circular-canal-bridge/articleshow/73261416.cms

CHANDIGARH: As many as 87% of pedestrians fear for their lives while crossing the roads in the city, according to a survey conducted by an NGO.

ArriveSafe, the NGO on road safety, conducted ‘Pedestrian Perception Survey’ on 520 pedestrians — 376 males and 144 females — using six prominent locations, Aroma light point; ISBT, Sector 43, Vikas Marg; PGI, Madhya Marg; sectors 34 and 35 market/commercial/residential areas and sectors 45-46 road on Sukhna Path. The study said 452 of the respondents felt unsafe while crossing the roads and called the facilities for pedestrians poor. “As many as 89% of the pedestrians said they were forced to leave footpaths because of obstructions caused by parked vehicles, vendors or their bad condition,” they study said. “As many as 78% of females felt unsafe to walk in the dark. On the cleanliness index, only 13% considered footpaths good, 26% found them fair and 61% poor,” the study said.

According to an analysis by road safety cell of the traffic police, 35 of 98 people killed in road accidents in 2018 were pedestrians.

Harman Singh Sidhu, president, ArriveSAFE, said, “The outcome of the survey leaves a lot to be desired on part of the authorities and citizens. Pedestrians have to fend for themselves while using footpaths or crossing the roads. Their fear further increases vehicular dependability, even for travelling short distances, prompting expansion of roads and considering flyovers, which is not a citizen-friendly approach. The National Urban Transport Policy should be implemented in letter and spirit.”

The National Urban Transport Policy formulated in April 2006 recommended equitable allocation of space on people, not vehicles. Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations also talks of making cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.

The NGO said walkability is a measure of how friendly an area is for walking. According to the theory of walkability by Jeff Speck, “A walk has to satisfy four main conditions: it must be useful, safe, comfortable, and interesting.”

496,['15/01/2020'],Sood tipped to be next BJP chief,"This story is from January 15, 2020

Chandigarh: The city unit of the BJP will get a new president on Friday after a gap of 10 years. The central leadership of the party has approved the name of former mayor and councillor Arun Sood for the post after bringing unanimity among members of the electoral collegium of the BJP.

The party would initiate the election process on Thursday. Interested members could file nominations for the post. However, since the party has made its choice clear, it appears no one will offer a challenge.

The electoral collegium of BJP has 41 members, including city MP, 20 elected councillors and members from the district wings of the party.

“There is unanimity on the name of Sood and a formal announcement will be made on Friday. All local party leaders, office bearers and councillors have discussed the matter. Since we are a disciplined party and like the mayoral elections, the choice will be acceptable to all,” said a senior BJP leader.

Sources said the party’s senior leadership had been holding discussions in the matter for past few months. Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and BJP national vice-president Shivraj Singh Chauhan was made the in-charge to select the new party president. Chauhan had forwarded a few names to the senior leadership and after discussions with BJP officiating national president J P Nadda and others, the name of Sood was finalised.

Sood has political experience of almost 20 years and has been associated with the party since his days in ABVP. He was elected as a councillor for the second time in 2016.

As Sood has a few opponents in the Chandigarh BJP, it will be interesting to see how he will manage the party, especially when MC elections are scheduled to be held next year.
