Though he ignored it initially as something minor, by evening, his left hand had swollen and he had to be admitted to a hospital in Andheri. Shivin was later diagnosed with a hairline fracture.The actor told us, “The scene involved my on-screen younger brother and me chasing each other in the bedroom. That’s when I fell on my hand. Since it’s a fracture, I have had to cancel my New Year plans with family; I had planned a trip to Mahabaleshwar. I will also not be able to shoot for a couple of days. I am thankful to God that I was discharged and was able to spend time with my parents. During my earlier two shows, too, I had suffered many injuries. This is a part and parcel of our job. Hopefully, 2020 will be a good year without any injuries.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73045294,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-54777/73045294.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/shivin-narang-injures-his-hand-on-the-set-of-his-show/articleshow/73045308.cms
1,['1/01/2020'],Allergy cases on the rise in Bengaluru,"Have you been suffering from cough, throat congestion, nasal discharge or itchy nose? If you’ve been complaining of any of these symptoms, chances are that you’ve fallen prey to allergens around you. Bengaluru has been witnessing a rise in allergy cases and the problem has affected many residents in the city. BT talks to experts to find out the reasons for the spike in such cases and how to keep them at bay...Apart from the city’s erratic weather, experts point to the depleting air quality — indoor and outdoor — as the reason for the spike in such cases, especially around this time of the year. On average, city clinics and hospitals record approximately 20 allergic rhinitis, allergic rashes and eczema cases every day. Dr Vivek Anand Padegal, a city-based lung specialist, says, “At least 50% of my outpatient cases comprise nasal allergies and most of the patients come when their condition is worse. This is a common problem, especially during winter.”“Seasonal allergies mostly occur because of dust mites, animal dander (such as fur or dead skin cells of animals) and cockroach droppings, etc. Mold, too, causes seasonal allergies. Symptoms include sneezing, wheezing and itching in the eyes. In Bengaluru, pollen from flowering trees add to the problem. It is suggested to avoid exposure to known triggers. One can use humidifiers to minimise allergies,” advises Dr S Manohar, an Internal Medicine specialist at a city hospital. Dr Gayathri Pandit, Consultant ENT surgeon and Allergy Specialist, explains, “House dust mites are often called asthamogenic allergen. It is a major cause of combined upper and lower respiratory allergy. It is also a common first allergen sensitivity to be seen in children. In the skin-prick allergy test that we conduct, nearly 75% to 80% comprise house dust mite allergy. It’s also the main respiratory allergen, contributing to nearly 75% of sensitivity. At least, 20% allergies are caused by pollens — Parthenium, Amaranthus Spinosus, Prosopis Juliflora, Ricinus Communis and castor oil plant. These may lead to respiratory illness.”The rising pollution levels in Bengaluru also aggravate the problem. “Apart from pollen, the drop in air quality, because of construction, dust, fume and emissions from vehicles, also trigger allergies. With clouds trapping all the allergens and pollutants, the condition can worsen for many people. Poor air quality can make asthma and allergies worse,” explains Dr Vivek.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73046139,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-770924/73046139.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/allergy-cases-on-the-rise-in-bengaluru/articleshow/73046139.cms

3,['1/01/2020'],"I respect my competitors, because they bring out the best in me: Yash","Every once in a while, there comes a star. The decade gone by has done the needful and given the film industry one. Today, Yash is not just a star in the Kannada film industry, but is one who is recognised beyond language and geographical boundaries. It is, incidentally, this very vision that this youngster set out with 10 years ago. For this artiste, who makes no bones about calling himself a businessman at the core, changing mindsets — of his audience, the people he works with and most importantly, his own, have been the most challenging aspect of his journey. “There are only a few things such as one’s health, accidents etc., that is beyond one’s control. For everything else, hard work and perseverance can make anything possible,” he states. Inspiring? Well, that is just the beginning. At the onset of a new decade today, here’s decoding the man who has become the kind of star that many often dream about…The decade has been wonderful. The first best thing that happened to me over the last decade was the fact that I met Radhika (Pandit), my wife. Our relationship started around 2011, I think I was shooting for my film Lucky at that time. So, on the personal front (with regards to love, marriage, and children), it has been wonderful. On the professional front, the commercial success that my films Kirataka and Lucky achieved sort of set the path ahead during the initial years of the decade. I have always believed that whatever you do will become a stepping stone in your career — whether it was good or bad. I do believe everything happens for the good. Every incident or action has a lot of points that help you chalk out your way forward. Even if there is something that you see as a bad episode, it does give you an opportunity to learn from it. One must always take everything in a very positive way. When I look back, I have had a positive mindset and a bit of aggression. I didn’t think of it in the form of a decade as such, but every year I focused on being better and bigger. I knew there was a lot within me, to explore, to understand.I do believe everything happens for the good. I believe that the whole world is on this journey with you and is looking at you. When you want to achieve something, you have to first convince yourself that it is possible, and you need to be crazy about it. You have to believe that it is going to happen, and it will happen eventually.God has a plan, that is there. But you don’t change your field when you are looking for that path or destiny. One decade is a very long time for one to be able to create something out of your life in your profession. If you spend 10 years working passionately, in any profession, eventually you will end up being something. To be able to stay on and survive there itself is a big thing.To sustain, in spite of all the difficulties and problems that come with the job and still stick on — not doing the same old thing, but keep on improving and bettering yourself while at it — eventually, you will end up being something you would be proud of. Personally speaking, I can say that yes, today — whatever I am today is because of the work that I have put in over the last decade.Kannada films have always been there. But there was an issue with the mind set of our people about our industry. I used to feel really bad, especially when you see other industry being respected in the state. When it comes to IT, they say Bengaluru is the IT city. When it is about fashion, they say Bengaluru is one of the best in the field. We excel in English and Kannada theatre, we win so many awards for literature. Kannadigas were proud about so many of these things, except Kannada films. They would say, Kannada is a small industry, it has its limitations. At that point, I felt, I am here and people have given me the chance or an opportunity to make a difference. And when I have that kind of power where I can bring in a change, if I don’t do anything about it, or if I don’t even try, I will be a failure.As far as KGF is concerned, I have always brought in this comparison. Look at our soldiers, they go to war. Irrespective of whether he wins or he dies, a soldier will always be respected. So, like that, I always felt, we are soldiers. We had to do this to fight for our respect. In this process, I figured that perception and mindsets were the main issue. To tackle that, I started talking positive. I started building an atmosphere around me where I told everybody that it is changing. When you start thinking about good things, or when you start imagining good things, when you say that something good is going to happen, you are excited about something, you will then start focusing only on those good things and you will somehow get there. I started putting that thought into the minds of people around me. Soon, my producers started thinking, ‘yes, we can change.’ If one person believes in something, and others around this person see that there is a positive change and that it is working, then will follow you. There was a point when after I had said something positive, a day or two later, someone else would come to me and tell me the same thing. That’s how I knew it was working. So, first you have to convince yourself and then you need to bring in change. There is the whole idea of law of attraction — yes, it does work. In my life, it has happened. During this process, I tried stretching the market, brought in new quality, and eventually brought in competition. If there is no competition, the market is not good. Why do we compete? We compete because there is potential. I wanted this kind of competition, because where there is competition, the quality goes high. When the quality goes up, people start noticing.There was a time when people, including friends of mine, were not willing to say ‘we watch Kannada films’. It was not cool to say so. It was important to address that mindset. If my own friends are telling me that they do not watch Kannada films, but were keen on watching other regional films, we had to relook at what was lacking. From the technicalities involved, to the budgets for a film, or even the styling, there are a lot of elements involved. We started identifying and recognising talents. I worked with the younger crop in various departments. I did not work with seniors in the field, because what happens is they already have their way around their work that has brought them success. They would not want to change that equation that has been working for them. With youngsters, there is a sense of open-mindedness where was keen on exploring. I also had Jayanna as a producer who believed in me. He produced five of my films back-to-back. Each time, the budget went higher than the previous one. We were constantly exploring and experimenting with new things.In the market too, in the borders of the south states, they were not playing Kannada films. That changed too, coincidentally though. It was the time when there was a brief ban on Telugu film screenings during the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana issue. At that time, screens in these areas started approaching us for our films. As luck would have it, two or three films of mine were out around that time. I gave them Googly and Raja Huli on the condition that if the ban is off soon, they cannot remove my film if there is a demand for it. These were well-maintained theatres that usually only played films of other languages. And our films being screened there worked for us. Once they got familiar with our work, my next film also was received in a big way in that area. That is how I stretched my market. There was extra revenue coming in from all these areas, we directed that towards our next films to raise the bar yet again in terms of bringing in quality. All of this was the process where we started building and restructuring the way we work on our films while addressing all the issues that were identified. We started working with talent, some of our writers turned directors — be it Santosh Anandram or Manju Mandavya. Honestly, I cannot claim to be the only person who brought about a change here, but these are some of the issues that I personally noticed and started addressing.I had been to a couple of award ceremonies before where I had noticed a sort of discrimination towards Kannada films and actors here. I believe that there is nothing called big industry or small industry. People who work there make it big or small. Karnataka is rich in everything, we have the resources, we have our people who love our culture. I felt that attitude towards us was not right. If you start competing with your neighbouring states, you will end up making films that are just about up to that standard. Our aim should be to compete with world cinema. Luckily, my director Prashant Neel had the vision and talent to see it through, my producer Vijay Kiran, has the kind of passion and resource to facilitate the same. Incidentally, KGF was not made for pan India. It was a film for Karnataka. While filming it, I realised it had the potential to be a pan-India film. Prashant was sceptical. To be honest, he is not happy with what he has done with KGF Chapter 1. What he is doing in KGF 2, you will see a pan-India film.Today, I am happy with the way people talk about our industry. I think I have helped push towards that change at least partially. It was about changing mindset. For instance, you see people jumping signals. That happens, not because there is a lack of policing, but because people believe they can get away with it. We need to break that mindset. Today, when it comes to Kannada cinema, people are stretching their limits, aiming to produce quality work. The audience is expanding too, and people who do not even know the language here now ask about Kannada films they can check out.There was a point when we would think so much about when we could release our films. There was always an attempt to release films when no other big releases from other industries were posing a threat to our market. If you go back and check history, I have released my films on the same day as some of the bigger and promising Bollywood films. I was confident about my product, I tried. At the end the day, if both the films are good, people with watch both. If our film is good, it will never be deprived. People will come and watch it and they did. Now, nobody is worried about which other language film is releasing in Karnataka. Now, the other industries have to think about when they release their films in our state. That itself is a change in the mindset. Instead, we are looking at pan India releases for so many of our films today. Just like how our people have supported other language films here before, their people are now supporting our films in their states. It is no more regional, it is global.I respect my competitors because they bring out the best in me. When they say that they are the best, a person like me will say — okay, hold on, you don’t know what’s in store, what’s coming. I respect them they do a good job and I enjoy it when they are successful. I enjoy their success. But I also say, watch out. If I start feeling that they should fail, then I will fail. Imagine there is a race, where everybody falls and you win. Can you call yourself a winner? No. I want everyone to run fast. But I want to win that race. Competition is always good, and it is there in our industry now. There are many people and I want many more to come. For our industry to grow and become bigger, we need more heroes. We need more stars, more films that assure you of definite guarantee of success. People say you should be doing at least two movies a year. If a subject demands a shorter period to work on, I will look at it. But as of now, I do not see myself doing that.People do get influenced by the success of one film, and they go overboard, and they may end up losing money. But today, there are enough platforms where a bit of strategy and planning will ensure your investment on a movie is safe. The truth is that in film industries worldwide, only a few films make money, not all films make that mark. Still, you cannot discourage people from making that film. So, many people, like me, run away from home to be an actor. Very few survive. But that does not mean you can question or discourage another aspiring actor from pursuing his dreams. As for quality of a film, it is debatable topic. My mother might think I am the most handsome guy on earth. Someone else’s mother may think her son is the most handsome one around. A film is one’s baby. You do get carried away, but that’s how the trade is. What works today may not work tomorrow. One should be updated. If I am not updated, I shouldn’t be here. The people who want to come into this industry should do proper research. Nowadays, every Friday every film says they broke all records. That is bullshit. They should project the right figures. Today, things are becoming more transparent, because of GST etc. People are forced to present the correct picture. Because for a layman, or for a newcomer, or a new producer — claims of broken records are misleading and they will not be able to make informed decisions as far as their projects are concerned. I want them to be more careful.I am a very optimistic person. When the whole world says things are going bad, I do read the news. I have read about how the world was, we have seen barbaric times. We are a lot more polished now. We have the exposure to news today. We get to know of what is happening anywhere in the world at the click of a button. What you see is what it is. You build your opinions about what you see around you. There are a lot of people who lead their lives happily with even a `5,000 in their pocket, and there are other with crores in their bank accounts are and still unhappy. We live in a world of false perceptions too, where we portray our lives to the world in a way we think we should be seen. When you don’t enjoy the small little pleasures that life offers you, you will say the world is not good. When you do the opposite, everything will start becoming good. Enjoy the process, don’t ponder about the outcome. Happiness is a state of mind.Yes, there are crimes. We have to stand for the right and fight against what is not right. And the government needs to bring in change as well. There are issues that we as individuals need to correct as well. For instance, in an organisation, the attitude of the organisation trickles down to the attitude of the employees and vice versa. If something is wrong with the system, it will affect everyone in the system. We create this system, and we are in a position to make that change. One should have that sense of pride for one’s own country and be the change you want to see. India needs to come out of all the inhibitions and issues. Every country has gone through different crises and have overcome them. I read about this shoe company in Japan , wherein the workers of this company decided to go on a protest. They did not stop production, instead, they manufactured only one shoe out of a pair, till their demands were met. So, while they were protesting, they did not waste time with no production, but still conveyed their message and made the required impact. We should look at protests that will bring in results rather than waste time and energy.KGF2 is coming out really well, we are trying to raise the bar. When people give you that kind of success, it does not mean you can sit back and relax. It means that they are expecting more out of you. People have given us that kind of strength and responsibility. While KGF2 is going to be massive, my next work after that has to be something beyond that or something entirely different. I have a few stories I want to work on. But I will wait for another two months before zeroing in on one.I honestly don’t know about that. I do take up responsibilities, by nature I do have leadership qualities. I do not point fingers. I always say what can I do to make things better. Maybe that quality has made people assume or think that I might pursue a career in politics. As an artiste, people have given me a certain amount of power through which I can bring about change. Today, I am able to reach out to more people than a politician would be able to – at least regarding certain issues. So, what I can do now, I will do it. I am not someone who says I don’t like politics, it’s a dirty game. But at the same time, I am not excited about it, at least for now. I don’t mind doing it, but only if it is required. If someone else is doing it, I am happy to cheer for them and support them. Right now, I am very happy to be staying away and letting someone else do it.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73046298,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-265917/73046298.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/i-respect-my-competitors-because-they-bring-out-the-best-in-me-yash/articleshow/73046079.cms
4,['1/01/2020'],Strong New Year resolutions keep young minds motivated,"Fitness goals: Many students like to improve their health and fitness by planning their workout schedule for the entire year.

Becoming more organised: Students, who have a messy room, closet or a cluttered study table, often resolve to change their habits, says Nishat.

Quitting an addiction: From quitting bad habits like eating junk food to smoking, many students said this resolution is a popular one.

Traveling to new destinations: Nishat believes that apart from being a social media favourite, this resolution is also popular among groups of friends in colleges.

Academic goals: According to Hanisha, this is an important resolution for those who are graduating, as it helps them set a clear path for their career.

As 2020 begins, everyone, including Bengaluru’s college students, are making New Year resolutions in the hope to do better. Bangalore Times gets chatty with city students to know their take on New Year resolutions.Talking about New Year resolutions, Diwas Kaushik, a third-year student at New Horizon College, shares that he has already achieved a major career goal because of making a New Year resolution and sticking to it. “I had resolved to perform as an actor on a public platform and I managed to achieve that goal within a year. I made it to the finale of Times Fresh Face. So, I definitely believe in New Year resolutions. They motivate you to achieve the goals you’ve set for yourself. Now, my resolution for 2020 is to become fit and strong,” he adds.While some students are ambitious when it comes to setting goals, others think it’s easier to stick to resolutions if they’re practical. Hanisha Sanjay, a third-year student from Mount Carmel College, says, “A good rule of thumb is to start with small goals or changes that can be achieved easily. Those who set goals that are difficult to achieve, like losing an excessive amount of weight or travelling to several destinations, may end up feeling disappointed if they’re unable to achieve them. It can also divert their attention from other important tasks.”Milind Francis, a third year student of St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous), believes that a New Year or the first day of the year, shouldn’t be the only day for setting goals. “It doesn’t make sense to make resolutions on a particular day. It can be made at any time. It depends on how strong your resolve is to achieve your goal,” says Milind.Apart from achieving goals, what if your resolutions get you more social media content? Nishat Sheikh, a first year MBA student at Manipal University, believes that New Year resolutions matter the most to students who have a major chunk of their personal lives online. “I have seen many social media influencers and vloggers make resolutions and they even achieve their tasks by the end of the year. They are involved in tasks like fitness, travel to reading books or watching a film a day, and so on. Apart from actually completing their tasks, they get a lot of content for their social media handles too,” says Nishat.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73045444,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-163306/73045444.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/strong-new-year-resolutions-keep-young-minds-motivated/articleshow/73045444.cms

8,['1/01/2020'],"Music helped me find my purpose in life, says Bindhumalini","Award-winning artiste Bindhumalini ’s musical portfolio is quite a medley — she has been the music director for feature films, has worked on documentaries and has also collaborated on different projects with artistes from various genres such as musical poetry and dastangoi. In a candid chat with, Bindhu, who was honoured with a Filmfare trophy earlier this month, reflects on her musical journey in the past 10 years, her equation with her husband, musician Vasu Dixit , and more. Excerpts:This decade has been a huge milestone — from being a graphic designer, I became a full-time musician. Before finding my true calling, I had completed two bachelor’s degrees and two master’s degrees. But something seemed lacking. I wanted to find a purpose in life, and that’s why, I journeyed back to music. For me, music is magic. It’s more than just an inherent skill. It helped me heal. And there has been no looking back since. I am very proud of my body of work in the past 10 years and thankful for the acknowledgement and recognition that I have received so far, as well as the wonderful collaborations that have come my way.It has been an organic process. And I am glad that my work has shaped up like this. Perhaps, when filmmakers work on women-centric subjects, they believe that women can do justice in terms of the creative output as well. And, I guess, that is how the makers of Aruvi and Nathicharami chose me to direct music for both the films). Similarly, while working on her documentary, titled Survey Number Zero, director Priya Thuvassery shared a post on social media, expressing that she was looking to work with an all-women crew. Someone tagged me on that post, and that’s how I got to work with her.The works of all those who I have collaborated with — including Ananya Kasaravalli, MD Pallavi , Vedanth Bharadwaj and Ankit Chadha — engaged with life in different ways, and associating with them has enabled me to create interesting content. It helped me go back to the core of where all things begin, and has helped with my journey of self-discovery, too.When I hear people say that something in my music moves them or heals them, I realise that one cannot cheat on something like that. If we stay authentic to the process, others experience what we are trying to convey.Through my journey, Vasu has been a constant source of support, and his intense passion to constantly create music inspires me.

10,['1/01/2020'],Bengaluru students wish for peace and a greener planet,"2019 was mostly about the youth voicing their opinions. As we step into the new decade, students in Bengaluru are poised to make themselves heard not just on the campus but outside, too. They are determined to take bold initiatives and bring about a positive change in society. Here’s what they have to say…With several students leading protests across the country, those in Bengaluru feel that this generation will be the voice of reason in the next 10 years too. “Youngsters are more likely to actively participate in India’s socio-political campaigns. And the country’s current scenario testifies that,” says Anushka Madhukar, a student of St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous).When it comes to allowing them to speak their mind, students also expect educational institutions to be more liberal in the new year. “This will enable youngsters to become better leaders of tomorrow,” says Anagha TV, a student of Mount Carmel College. On the contrary, she also wants the protests to end soon. “It’s been going on for so long that I want it to end now,” she adds.Given the intensity with which climate change-related topics were discussed last year, students think that the new decade, too, will be dedicated to saving the environment. “I am, personally, very worried about our degrading environment. This new decade will determine how our future will unfold. It’s encouraging to see that more and more youngsters are coming together to voice their concern over the rising pollution levels and global warming. It’s a cause that needs to be backed both by the government and the people. And, I see that happening today among students,” says Ushua Prashant, a student from Mount Carmel College.According to Malini Pai N — a student of Christ (deemed-to-be) University — the environment will continue to be the focal point in the new decade. “We have witnessed devastating forest fires and other natural calamities, indicating that we’re on the brink of something irreversible. Little has been done so far to protect the planet, but I hope that things will take a better turn in the new decade,” she says.Another concern that the student community has been trying to attract everyone’s attention to is mental well-being. “I don’t want to see more hatred and anxiety in society. These only lead to depression among youngsters,” asserts Ushua. Aditya DN — a student of Jain (deemed-to-be) University, Centre for Management Studies — says that maintaining one’s physical and mental balance amid all the chaos around is difficult. “I want to work towards my goals, and for that I need to keep myself fit and have a positive approach in life,” he says adding, “I want to make the most of 2020 and do not want to waste my time on unnecessary things. If all of us put our collective energy into something good and productive, it will make us and everyone around us happy.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73045626,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-202999/73045626.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/bengaluru-students-wish-for-peace-and-a-greener-planet/articleshow/73045626.cms

There was angst in her voice when she was eliminated from the house for the first time. But this time around, she’s walked out of the house with peace of mind, and also claims to have made friends during her stay.“It wasn’t like I walked into the house again, after the two-week break, with an agenda. After being eliminated the first time, I got to see how the show is followed and where I was going wrong. Hence, this time, I told myself that I wouldn’t not keep to myself or stay quiet. This has, in a way, helped me know many people personally,” she says.But the second stint, Chaitra claims, has made her a happier person. “After the first elimination, I walked out of the house feeling wronged, and also had many things left to be expressed. This time around, though, I found peace and closure, and also made friends inside the house. And I hope that these friendships will continue even outside the house. I am fond of Shine Shetty, Vasuki Vaibhav, Bhoomi Shetty and Chandana, and I want to collaborate with each one on creative projects,” Chaitra explains, adding, “They might have nominated me this week, but that is the nature of the game and I do not hold it against them. I’m sure my name was taken because I didn’t stay in the house through the entire duration. And that’s fair enough.”While there was an urgency in her starting to work on projects before she went back into the house, Chaitra says that now she is in no hurry. “I want to do good films, and enact better characters.

15,['1/01/2020'],Are you suffering from that ‘January 1 morning-after’ heel pain?,"Okay, so you’re all partied out after a wild night yesterday. That revelry has probably left you with more than a bunch of fun memories. If you have woken up with feet that feel like a ton of bricks or are finding yourself nursing an inflammation or throbbing ache in your ankles, then there’s a name for it — it’s called a ‘high heel hangover’. This is termed as that after-partying foot pain that you suffer after a long night of being in your stilettos — walking around or dancing, and it’s what most people suffer especially on January 1. And guess what, it’s not to be taken lightly. Those who have been there, done that, share their foot woes and a few ways to help you return from high-heel hell…For Goregaon-based IT expert Harshita Shah, January 1 is spent at home on account of foot pain from the night before. “I always suffer from a high heel hangover after partying, with swollen ankles, foot soreness and immense pain. So much so, that since last year, as soon as I get home after the party, I apply balm on my feet and soak them, too. This ritual is as important to me as my make-up removing mantra. Nevertheless, I still wake up with painful feet. I love my heels — the higher the heels, the better the look, so since I am not going to give them up, I am finding new ways to deal with it,” she says.Adds advertising professional Ziana Wadia, “Although I love wearing high heels, I wear them only for parties or weddings because of the strain they cause on the feet and back. I try and wear silicone pads to give my feet some cushioning. I wore my fave stilettos on December 31 and the day after that, I soaked my feet in a tub of hot water and some aromatic bath salts, and massaged them as this practice this gives me a lot of relief. I also carry a pair of flats along on a night out, in case I need to remove my heels for some time; it helps.”Says orthopaedic foot and ankle reconstructive surgeon Dr Abhishek Kini, “High heel pain is not to be taken lightly. I tell people that any injury that arises out of it, such as ankle twisting, should not be ignored. Toes getting cramped is another common issue that women face. What happens is when you squeeze your foot into high heels, it places a load on one point rather than on the entire foot. This causes an overload, which can lead to a stress fracture. Prolonged high heel use can also cause behind the heel of the foot and calves.” He shares a tip so that the feet do not cramp the next morning. “One of the easiest home remedies is to stretch the calves well and flex the foot by opening out the toes. Do this before you sleep. Remember, this is marathon season with people already training for it. Any further strain such as wearing heels at a party for long duration adds to the risk of a stress fracture at this time.”Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Miten Sheth says cutting down on heel-wearing time may help. “There are a lot of complaints about foot pain after a long night of partying in heels. Our advice is to wear the heels for a short duration in case you can’t completely avoid them,” he advises.To relive foot and heel pain, place a tennis ball or a rubber ball under the foot and roll it gently. This loosens up the foot and gets rid of plantar fasciitis (inflammation of the fibrous tissue along the bottom of the foot). Roll each leg for one minute.Sit and cross one leg over the other. Using both thumbs, apply pressure along the length of your foot (underneath). Use gentle but steady pressure and work towards the toes. Repeat for the other leg.This simple trick can be done with a bottle that has been frozen in the refrigerator. Sit on a chair and place the frozen bottle underfoot. Do a back and forth rolling motion until you feel relaxed.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73046042,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-14445/73046042.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/are-you-suffering-from-that-january-1-morning-after-heel-pain/articleshow/73045956.cms
16,['1/01/2020'],Sarwar Ahuja: We spent the New Year’s eve with our son Sartaj in Lucknow: Aditi Sharma and Sarwar Ahuja,"Lucknow girl and actress Aditi Sharma and her hubby actor Sarwar Ahuja ushered in the New Year by spending the night with the new entrant in the family, their son Sartaj. The couple was recently blessed with a son who was delivered at a hospital in Lucknow. “This New Year Eve was really special for us since we got to spend it with out little Krishna, our Sartaj. We have always spent the New Year’s Eve with our friends in Mumbai, partying. But this time it was just the three of us and my parents, having a gala time watching this little angel in our life, who has completely changed our lives,” shared an elated Aditi, getting emotional. Adding, Sarwar said, “Sartaj is actually awake the whole night -- I mean he sleeps the whole day and he is awake the whole night till 6 am. So, we played with him the whole night.” Ask daddy Sarwar on how life has changed post fatherhood and he said, “Life has changed a lot but in a good way. Our whole life now revolves around Sartaj. Taking care of his needs, guessing why he is crying, timing the changing of diapers, every conversation now revolves around him. Another good change that I have observed personally in me over this month is that I have become more caring about my parents. I have realised that in old age, parents too become like kids and they need to be taken care of just like the babies.”Aditi and Sarwar with their son Sartaj (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)Although life has now become a routine for the couple looking after their son, but Aditi explains that things actually didn’t go as per the plan for the two of them as Sartaj was born three weeks before the due date. “I always used to tell Sarwar that I want you to be there by my side when the baby arrives and as per the plan he had got his tickets booked a day before the due date. But things changed at the last minute.”“The only regret I have is that I was not there with Aditi when all this happened. I really wanted to feel the first moment when Sartaj came into this world. But three weeks before the due date, I get a call from Aditi saying that the doctor has called her to the hospital,” said Sarwar, adding, “Every minute I was getting the updates and within an hour or so I got the news that we have had a baby boy. I took a flight the same night and as luck would have it, I missed my connecting flight as it got cancelled and it was after a lot of jaddo-jehad that I managed to reach the hospital,” said Sarwar.And while Aditi was hesitant to carry the baby in her arms, Sarwar has proved to be quite a pro. “Sarwar is actually quite good with kids though I am scared of carrying newborns. It is only when I started holding him for the mother’s feed that I became okay and a bit comfortable. The last newborn I carried in my lap was my own brother’s baby that too when I was seven years old. Woh bhi bed ke centre mein baitha ke I held him. But that was way back. Before Sartaj was born, I would ask everyone ki main itne chhote baby ko kaise pakdungi and then I would get that same reply ki sab kuchh apne aap aa jayega, don’t worry. And I used to be like ki achha...okay, let’s wait and watch,” said Aditi with a laugh.Sarwar with his son Sartaj (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)So did the two of them wish for a boy? “Well, to be frank we just prayed for a healthy baby and were really okay with both the genders. But yes, our friends in Mumbai were really excited to guess the gender. I remember how at Aditi’s baby shower, half of our friends who thought it will be a girl, wore pink and the ones who wanted it to be a boy, wore blue and there was a tug of war between them. It was really fun to see them being so excited for the baby’s arrival. More so, because in our group of friends, we are the first ones to have a baby,” said Sarwar.Ask them how life has changed post Sartaj’s arrival and Sarwar is quick to add, “Life has changed so much! Before we had a baby, both Aditi and I were living a nomadic life. Making plans in the night, travelling to different places, partying till the wee hours but all that will change now,” shared Sarwar, adding “We have been married for six years now and we took our time to transition into the next phase of our life – parenthood. I remember whenever Aditi used to say to me that we should plan a child, I always used to tell her that we will whenever she is ready to have one. In fact, the same reply used to be to everyone in our family who asked us about when we were planning to start a family. I was very clear on this that I wanted Aditi to be ready for motherhood as most of the changes will by default come in her life – personally and professionally. She was right now at the peak of her career.”So was Aditi prepared for motherhood, we asked. “Yes, I was very sure. I think this was the right time for us to become parents. I was mentally prepared for the new phase of our life. Motherhood is a really beautiful feeling but one has to be ready for it. I remember getting to know I have conceived while I was shooting for my Punjabi film which will release next year. I also thankfully fulfilled all my professional commitments and now I can peacefully enjoy motherhood. Also, during the process I realised that real-life motherhood is really different from a reel one. I have played a mother and a pregnant women several times on screen. For that, I used to observe a lot of pregnant ladies but real life mein experience was completely hatt ke.”So has she decided on how long the break from work is going to be? “Well, I haven’t planned anything as such. Let’s see since work commitment on television is really long. After a few months, I will be working towards making a comeback. But as of now, we are really excited for Sartaj’s first Lohri celebrations which will be in Hyderabad, in Sarwar’s hometown. It will be a big day for all of us,” said she.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73046978,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-323737/73046978.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/we-spent-the-new-years-eve-with-our-son-sartaj-in-lucknow-aditi-sharma-and-sarwar-ahuja/articleshow/73046967.cms
17,['1/01/2020'],Are you hungover today? Fix it with a heavy breakfast,"Welcome to the New Year, and if you are guilty of downing one too many shots the night before, chances of you waking up with a hangover are high. It can be a challenge to get through the day with a headache and not everyone is adept at battling through the nauseous state. However, it helps to pay heed to what experts have to say about it. Dietician Sheela Tanna advises you to take a dotshot the night before as that supposedly helps you wake up the next morning minus a hangover. She adds, “If you have overindulged, then you must be prepared to deal with the repercussions the morning after. A throbbing headache is just one of the fallouts, but a hearty breakfast can help you deal with some of the aftereffects. Waffles with butter and maple syrup, eggs, fruits and a combination of carbohydrates and fats are known to help combat the hangover the following morning. Also, liquids other than water should be avoided to keep that feeling of nausea at bay.” Make a note of your drinks and Don’t mix them to avoid a hangoverLimit the quantity of alcohol intake at one time. Consume it slowly instead of downing shots one after the other. Keep yourself hydrated and do not drink on an empty stomach. No matter what the temptation, avoid mixing your alcohol. Stick with beer and wine as they are the safest bets to avoid any kind of hangover provided they are consumed in moderation. Don’t mix vodka with whiskey as you will end up with a bad headache. Fruit and vegetable juices are better mixes for your drinks instead of soda because of the extra vitamins in the former. Avoid fried foods with booze, and do not mix alcohol with medication. Opt for protein and fiber rich foods with your drinks.Alcohol such as tequila and whiskey has high level of methanol and hence, high congener present in it causes a bad hangover. So, if you are looking to consume alcohol that doesn’t give a hangover, opt for vodka, gin or rum. According to mixologist Latesh Kotian a vodka/rum-based cocktail without sugar and with antioxidants, vitamin C and potassium gives a hangover-free morning after.Drinking alcohol induces oxidative stress, whose effect can be reduced by using antioxidants. The use of natural antioxidant ingredients like saffron, turmeric, beetroot reduction and mulled cucumber can help fight this oxidative stress.Use fresh orange juice, lemon, pineapple, etc, which provides flavour and vitamin C, that your body needs.Use of potassium rich ingredients like banana, orange, cucumber, grapefruit, coconut water, etc helps in retaining water content in the body, when alcohol dehydrates the body.Using natural or simple sugar will help reduce the hangover.Gin – 60 mlFresh cucumber slice 2-3piecesIn-house rose syrup – 20 mlFresh lemon juice -10 mlTonic water- Top upGlassware - Burgundy glassGarnish - fresh cucumber peel and rose petalsMix all of the ingredients with fresh lemon juice and enjoy!Mixologist Latesh Kotian shares, “This cocktail is made with rose syrup with contains Vitamins C, cucumber is rich in potassium, fiber and vitamin C which is great for you overall.

19,['1/01/2020'],2020: What the numbers predict for India,"Here are astro-numerologist Anupam V Kapil’s predictions for the countryBorn on August 15, 1947, India is ruled by number 8 (Saturn). In its 73rd year, it will be ruled by number 9 (Mars). The country’s fate number is 6, which is ruled by Venus and its destiny number is 8. Number 6 is a peace-loving number and Number 8 is the tough karmic task master of destiny.At the moment, India is ruled by Narendra Modi, born on 17 September 1950, with fate number 8.As India enters its 73rd year, a solar eclipse in India’s 8th house will involve Sun, Moon and Jupiter (planet of economy) being caught between Rahu and Ketu. This brings enhanced fears and uncertainty. India will go through personal year number 9 in 2020, which indicates closing of a nine-year cycle. Many methods/laws/customs might be abrogated. Though Number 9 is a painful vibration, the Universal vibration of 2020 is 4, which will force the governments across the world to create a new roadmap, foundation and structure to work in a disciplined way. Number 4 brings substantial progress in educational and commercial affairs. But all these good things will start happening only after September, when the engineering and auto sector shall start reviving slowly. The future will be of hydrogen, not of electric sector.The commercial truck segment shall take about two years to revive. New-age technologies discovered in 2020 and evolution of artificial intelligence will change the way businesses will be done in future.For the purpose of numerology, life is divided in to three periods: The digit corresponding with the month controls the first 27 years. For India, this month is August or Number 8. Saturn ruled from 1947 to 1974, during which we saw wars with Pakistan, China and Bangladesh.The second phase is governed by the birthday digit. For India, born on 15th, this digit is 6. So we had Venus ruling India for the next 27 years, from 1975 to 2002. This phase saw an increase in comforts but also wars and political assassinations due to an afflicted Venus in the 3rd house.From 2002 onwards, we are again being run by Number 8. Also, Jupiter will move temporarily in India’s ninth house in Capricorn and retrograde between May and September this year. It will act as an exalted planet, and by aspecting the 3rd house, it will increase the expenditure on army, railways and religious institutions. Major changes in judicial framework will be seen.A repeat of the dangerous Saturn-Pluto conjunctionA dangerous affliction of Pluto, the 10th lord of India’s Independence chart, is happening right now in India’s eighth house and will continue till mid-January 2020. Last time this happened was when there was civil unrest in Punjab. But slow planet conjunctions don’t give immediate results. Accidents and conspiracies are also foreseen when Mars crosses natal Ketu in the 7th house and meets transit Ketu and Jupiter in the 8th house in February.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73045947,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-165155/73045947.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/2020-what-the-numbers-predict-for-india/articleshow/73045569.cms

Lucknow girl and actress Aditi Sharma and her hubby actor Sarwar Ahuja ushered in the New Year by spending the night with the new entrant in the family, their son Sartaj. The couple was recently blessed with a son who was delivered at a hospital in Lucknow. “This New Year Eve was really special for us since we got to spend it with out little Krishna, our Sartaj. We have always spent the New Year’s Eve with our friends in Mumbai, partying. But this time it was just the three of us and my parents, having a gala time watching this little angel in our life, who has completely changed our lives,” shared an elated Aditi, getting emotional. Adding, Sarwar said, “Sartaj is actually awake the whole night -- I mean he sleeps the whole day and he is awake the whole night till 6 am. So, we played with him the whole night.”Ask daddy Sarwar on how life has changed post fatherhood and he said, “Life has changed a lot but in a good way. Our whole life now revolves around Sartaj. Taking care of his needs, guessing why he is crying, timing the changing of diapers, every conversation now revolves around him. Another good change that I have observed personally in me over this month is that I have become more caring about my parents. I have realised that in old age, parents too become like kids and they need to be taken care of just like the babies.”Aditi and Sarwar with their son Sartaj (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)Although life has now become a routine for the couple looking after their son, but Aditi explains that things actually didn’t go as per the plan for the two of them as Sartaj was born three weeks before the due date. “I always used to tell Sarwar that I want you to be there by my side when the baby arrives and as per the plan he had got his tickets booked a day before the due date. But things changed at the last minute.”“The only regret I have is that I was not there with Aditi when all this happened. I really wanted to feel the first moment when Sartaj came into this world. But three weeks before the due date, I get a call from Aditi saying that the doctor has called her to the hospital,” said Sarwar, adding, “Every minute I was getting the updates and within an hour or so I got the news that we have had a baby boy. I took a flight the same night and as luck would have it, I missed my connecting flight as it got cancelled and it was after a lot of jaddo-jehad that I managed to reach the hospital,” said Sarwar.And while Aditi was hesitant to carry the baby in her arms, Sarwar has proved to be quite a pro. “Sarwar is actually quite good with kids though I am scared of carrying newborns. It is only when I started holding him for the mother’s feed that I became okay and a bit comfortable. The last newborn I carried in my lap was my own brother’s baby that too when I was seven years old. Woh bhi bed ke centre mein baitha ke I held him. But that was way back. Before Sartaj was born, I would ask everyone ki main itne chhote baby ko kaise pakdungi and then I would get that same reply ki sab kuchh apne aap aa jayega, don’t worry. And I used to be like ki achha...okay, let’s wait and watch,” said Aditi with a laugh.Sarwar with his son Sartaj (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)So did the two of them wish for a boy? “Well, to be frank we just prayed for a healthy baby and were really okay with both the genders. But yes, our friends in Mumbai were really excited to guess the gender. I remember how at Aditi’s baby shower, half of our friends who thought it will be a girl, wore pink and the ones who wanted it to be a boy, wore blue and there was a tug of war between them. It was really fun to see them being so excited for the baby’s arrival. More so, because in our group of friends, we are the first ones to have a baby,” said Sarwar.Ask them how life has changed post Sartaj’s arrival and Sarwar is quick to add, “Life has changed so much! Before we had a baby, both Aditi and I were living a nomadic life. Making plans in the night, travelling to different places, partying till the wee hours but all that will change now,” shared Sarwar, adding “We have been married for six years now and we took our time to transition into the next phase of our life – parenthood. I remember whenever Aditi used to say to me that we should plan a child, I always used to tell her that we will whenever she is ready to have one. In fact, the same reply used to be to everyone in our family who asked us about when we were planning to start a family. I was very clear on this that I wanted Aditi to be ready for motherhood as most of the changes will by default come in her life – personally and professionally. She was right now at the peak of her career.”So was Aditi prepared for motherhood, we asked. “Yes, I was very sure. I think this was the right time for us to become parents. I was mentally prepared for the new phase of our life. Motherhood is a really beautiful feeling but one has to be ready for it. I remember getting to know I have conceived while I was shooting for my Punjabi film which will release next year. I also thankfully fulfilled all my professional commitments and now I can peacefully enjoy motherhood. Also, during the process I realised that real-life motherhood is really different from a reel one. I have played a mother and a pregnant women several times on screen. For that, I used to observe a lot of pregnant ladies but real life mein experience was completely hatt ke.”So has she decided on how long the break from work is going to be? “Well, I haven’t planned anything as such. Let’s see since work commitment on television is really long. After a few months, I will be working towards making a comeback. But as of now, we are really excited for Sartaj’s first Lohri celebrations which will be in Hyderabad, in Sarwar’s hometown. It will be a big day for all of us,” said she.In Video: Aditi Sharma & Sarwar Ahuja's special New Year wishes",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73046978,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-323737,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/we-spent-the-new-years-eve-with-our-son-sartaj-in-lucknow-aditi-sharma-and-sarwar-ahuja/articleshow/73046998.cms

The actress, who has featured in shows like ' May I Come In Madam? ?' and ' Comedy Dangal ', will tie the knot with her businessman beau Shardul Singh Bayas on January 5, 2020. While the sangeet will take place on January 3, the mehendi and engagement ceremonies will be held the following day. On Monday, the actress’ family performed a grahmukh puja.Talking about the marriage, she tells BT, “Though Shardul is a Rajput from Rajasthan, his family moved to Pune long ago. Today, he is as much a Maharashtrian as me. So, we are going to have a Maharashtrian wedding .”Ask her how she met her Mr Right and Nehha replies, “We met a little more than a year ago, at a common friend’s party. He first connected with me for professional reasons and that’s how we got talking. However, he was quite inquisitive about my personal life and soon asked me out on a date. But, I was apprehensive, as we were not even friends then. I told him that we should get to know each other first. My apprehension also stemmed from the fact that I just had an ugly break-up, and had not got over it. What drew me towards Shardul was his caring nature. He understood my fragile state of mind and soothed my broken heart. He, too, has been through a lot in life. He is also very well-read, intelligent, understanding and good at reading people’s minds. He cracked me on the first meeting (laughs!).”She adds, “Shardul proposed marriage three months after we started dating, in April. Both of us were looking at something more concrete and stable on the relationship front. We didn’t have the dekhte hain, chalta hai attitude. Shardul told me that he was ready to marry me that very day, but he wanted me to get over my past. At that point, I was seeking more than just love... I was looking for commitment and marriage as well. Both of us had burnt our fingers in love once and didn’t want to get into that space again. Also, we were serious about the institution of marriage. In fact, we hardly had mushy, romantic talks initially, we would instead have intelligent conversations. And that drew me closer to him. There is never a moment of boredom with Shardul. He is exactly what I wanted in my man. I guess this (marriage) was meant to happen.”While the wedding is round the corner, their honeymoon will have to wait. Nehha reveals, “We will get busy with our work immediately after the wedding. So, it will be a delayed honeymoon for us. We will mostly be going to Japan in April.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73050125,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-76696/73050125.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/nehha-pendse-i-was-seeking-more-than-love-i-wanted-commitment-and-marriage/articleshow/73050139.cms

25,['1/01/2020'],Nirmala Sitharaman: Rs 102 lakh crore investment plan for mega infrastructure push,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday unveiled a Rs 102 lakh crore infrastructure investment plan for the next five years, with less than a fifth consisting of new projects to begin with.It hopes to expand the pipeline, which was part of BJP’s election manifesto, in the coming months with Rs 3 lakh crore of state projects to be added in the next few weeks. The announcement came at a time when the Centre is keen to step up investment and the pipeline is seen to be signalling a step in that direction. Infrastructure gaps are seen to be a major reason for hobbling faster expansion of economic activity in the country and faster construction of new roads, power facilities and ports along with irrigation facilities are expected to also result in demand for cement and steel, which have been hit by the current economic slowdown.These projects are on top of Rs 51 lakh crore spent by the Centre and states during the last six years, the finance minister said at a press conference. Nearly 43% of the projects are under implementation, while another 33% are at conceptualisation stage.While the Centre and the states will equally split 78% of the proposed investments, the remaining 22% will come from the private sector with non-government participation expected to increase in the coming years. The mega investment plan will see the Centre’s capital outlay for infrastructure almost treble from an estimated Rs 3.5 lakh crore in 2018-19 to close to Rs 10 lakh crore by 2024-25. Similarly, budgetary allocation is projected to increase from Rs 1.4 lakh crore to over Rs 4 lakh crore during the same period.The largest chunk of the funds are proposed to be spent on creating power sector infrastructure.The investment pipeline came with policy prescriptions — ranging from tapping overseas investors more aggressively and monetisation of existing railway, power and highway projects to raise money, which can then be redeployed for creating fresh infrastructure.“We are looking at various steps to reform the PPP-based contracts, which have to be implemented. Dispute resolution, enforcement of contracts which are very critical components are being looked at when we're talking about reforming the entire process as per the suggestions given by various sub-groups under the task force,” Sitharaman said.The document on the infrastructure pipeline released by the minister also underlined the need for maintaining the sanctity of contracts. “In order to boost private sector interest, it is critical that the sanctity of contracts is upheld by the central, state and local governments. Repudiation of contracts must be restricted only to situations to be clearly defined in the contract. Provisions of contracts therein should be legally enforceable, which makes the parties involved legally abide by these contracts. In case of inability, there should be adequate safeguards built in in the form of clearly quantified termination payments under various possible scenarios,” it said at a time when investors are seen to be risk averse after states such as Andhra Pradesh decided to terminate contracts after the change of government in the state,Sitharaman also announced that the first edition of Annual Global Investors’ meet will be held in the second half of the coming year to meet investors on a single platform.“Creation of the national infrastructure pipeline in a short span of time is a positive step... The front-loading of capex is also positive for construction sector,” ICRA's Senior Vice-President and Group-Head, Corporate Ratings Shubham Jain said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73052574,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1363519,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rs-102-lakh-crore-investment-plan-for-mega-infrastructure-push/articleshow/73052571.cms

NAGPUR: The country lost 110 tigers in 2019, a third of them to poaching. The year also saw the death of 491 leopards, according to figures compiled by NGO Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI). As many as 38 tigers were lost to poaching, up from 34 in 2018.While there was a slight dip in leopard deaths from 500 in 2018, what remained a big cause of concern was the high number of leopard fatalities in road and rail accidents, which could be as high as a third of all deaths, said WPSI, which has been compiling data on big cat deaths for years.In case of tigers, there was a marginal rise in the number of deaths compared to 2018, when 104 tiger deaths were recorded.“No general inference can be drawn from these figures. Every landscape has its own set of pressures and problems, but leopards are getting killed in road and rail accidents, which is worrisome. It is the result of not just increasing traffic volumes but also increased speed due to widening of roads,” said Nitin Desai , WPSI’s Central India director.Madhya Pradesh continued to top the list of highest tiger deaths with 29 in 2019, followed by Maharashtra with 22. In 2018, MP had reported 23 tiger deaths followed by 19 in Maharashtra.Of the 110 deaths in 2019, 38 were attributed to body parts seizures and poaching, 26 were found dead, 36 died in fight with other tigers, three due to road/rail accidents and six during rescue.“On the one hand, it shows good detection rate and higher enforcement activity but on the other it also shows increasing demand for tiger body parts. Improving intelligence-led enforcement, addressing impact of linear intrusions and conflict management can help keep viable populations of tigers,” Joseph said.However, the official database of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), the country’s apex tiger conservation body, differed with the figures. NTCA recorded 92 tiger deaths in 2019 and 102 in 2018.Tito Joseph, programme coordinator of WPSI, said poaching and seizure of body parts of tigers had slightly increased in 2019. He said the difference in number in NTCA’s data may be due to non-inclusion of tiger deaths inferred from seizure of body parts. “We calculated the number of tigers depending on seizures, which may not necessarily belong to one tiger only,” Joseph said.For example, in Maharashtra the official figures record deaths of 18 tigers but it doesn’t include three tigers poached in Tumsar range in July 2019. The arrested accused have confessed that they killed three tigers there. This may be the case elsewhere as well.“Some mortalities were not communicated by the states to us… As far as the Tumsar tigers are concerned, the number has been split in MP and Maharashtra as some body parts were seized in MP,” an NTCA official said.As per the latest tiger estimation by NTCA-Wildlife Institute of India, there are 2,967 tigers in India. In Maharashtra, the number increased from 190 in 2014 to 312 in 2018. With 526 tigers, MP is at the top but deaths due to poaching remain a cause of concern in both states.There was a marginal drop in number of leopard deaths in 2019. Though NTCA doesn’t have a database on leopard deaths, WPSI data shows that 500 leopards had died across the country in 2018, which included 169 due to poaching. There was no let-up in poaching of leopards in 2019, as 127 of the 491 deaths were attributed to poaching.In 2019, Maharashtra accounted for 97 leopard deaths, with as many as 31 in road and rail accidents.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73052616,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1855020,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-lost-110-tigers-491-leopards-in-19-poaching-up-report/articleshow/73052610.cms
27,['1/01/2020'],Railway fare hike: Financial woes force Railways to hike fares for 1st time in 5 years,"File photo

NEW DELHI: In its first fare hike in five years, the railways on Tuesday announced increase in passenger charges that will see ticket prices rise by Rs 55-60 if you travel between Delhi and Mumbai or Kolkata on a Rajdhani from Wednesday onwards but did not touch suburban train fares .Though the fare increase is modest, in the range of 1-4 paise per km for different classes of travellers, the railways expects to generate an additional about Rs 2,300 crore annual revenue at a time when its finances are under acute stress.A hike had become pressing considering revenue shortfall during this fiscal (up to November-end) was close to Rs 20,000 crore. The operating ratio has increased to 121% till November-end during the current financial year as compared to 113% in the same period in 2018-19. Operating ratio is the amount spent to earn Rs 100, a higher ratio indicating poor financial health.While opting for an increase on long-distance travel, the railways has not burdened passengers travelling in suburban trains and season tickets have also been excluded from the hike. With nearly two-thirds of the passenger traffic accounted for by suburban rail, the segment accounts for a large share of losses for the state transporter. Those who have already pre-booked the tickets won’t have to pay extra.Officials said the government decided not to touch commuters in suburban trains since they often board trains multiple times a day and a hike would have escalated their costs. “Long- distance passengers travel more occasionally and since the hike is minimal, it won’t pinch them in a big way,” said a railway ministry official. The railways claimed suburban passengers have been left out, keeping the “affordability concerns of daily commuters”.According to an official statement, the increase in fare per km is 1 paisa for ordinary non-suburban classes (second class ordinary, sleeper class ordinary, first class ordinary) and 2 paise for mail/ express trains in non-AC class (second class mail/ express, sleeper class mail/ express, first class mail/ express). The hike for all AC tickets across trains will be 4 paise per km applicable for Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto, Vande Bharat, Tejas, Garib Rath, Antodaya and Jan Shatabdi trains.“There will be no change in charges for superfast charge, reservation fee. GST, as applicable will be levied,” said the official statement. Going by the norm, if a passenger is taking Delhi-Kolkata Rajdhani, the total fare (AC-2) would be dearer by around Rs 61.Last week, Railway Board chairman V K Yadav hinted at a hike in passenger fares, saying the railways would soon “rationalise” fare and freight charges. He added freight charges were already high. TOI on November 27 had first reported how the PMO asked the railways to increase passenger fare and asked it to “raise public awareness about the need for rationalisation”. Subsequently last month, it had asked the ministry to “explore possibilities of scheduled increase in passenger fare”.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73052626,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-468746,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/financial-woes-force-railways-to-hike-fares-for-1st-time-in-5-years/articleshow/73052621.cms
28,['1/01/2020'],Manoj Mukund Naravane: India reserves right to strike at terror sources: New Army chief,"This story is from January 1, 2020

NEW DELHI: Warning Pakistan that India reserves the right to pre-emptively strike at cross-border sources of terror if it does not stop state-sponsored terrorism, the country’s new military brass on Tuesday said the armed forces are in a high state of operational readiness and better prepared to tackle the challenges on the western and eastern fronts now.

“Yes, we are better prepared,” said the country’s first chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat . New Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane , in turn, said his force is “fully prepared to meet any eventuality” along the volatile Line of Control with Pakistan, which has witnessed as many as 3,200 ceasefire violations this year to beat all annual records since 2003.

A graded strategy of “resolute punitive responses” is in place to punish cross-border terrorism, said Gen Naravane, who took over as the 28th Army chief from Gen Rawat on Tuesday. “We are aware there are terrorists on the other side in various launchpads waiting to cross over but we are fully prepared to meet this threat. We have strong counter-infiltration and counter-terrorism grids, which we keep modifying as per the inputs that we receive,” he said, talking to news agencies.

“Our neighbour uses terrorism as tool of state policy, as a way of carrying out proxy war against us, while maintaining deniability. However, this state can’t last long. As they say, you can't fool all the people, all the time,” he added.

The Army chief also said the Pakistan Army-ISI combine’s relentless efforts to deflect attention from its state-sponsored terrorism had “totally failed”. There has been “a definite improvement” in the internal security situation in J&K after the abrogation of Article 370 , with the “proxy war” being waged from across the border suffering a major setback due to elimination of terrorists and terror networks. “The incidents of violence in J&K have seen a marked decline, this augurs very well for population of J&K. It’s a step forward towards bringing peace and prosperity to the region,” he said.

The military brass said border tensions with China along the Line of Actual Control had decreased substantially, with the two armies now actively working to reduce and manage troop confrontations after receiving “strategic guidance” from their leaders following the Wuhan summit in April 2018.

While India will continue to build its capabilities and infrastructure along the “northern borders” with China, the post-Wuhan guidelines had been disseminated right down the chain of command to the battalion-level to maintain peace and tranquility on the LAC, said Gen Naravane.

CAA protest in Muzaffarnagar (file photo)

MUZAFFARNAGAR: After spending 11 days in jail, a government clerk and three other men who were “mistakenly” picked up by Muzaffarnagar police after December 20 clashes walked free on Tuesday. Over 73 people are in jail for their alleged role in clashes and arson in Muzaffarnagar. Local police are in the process to identify more “innocent” people it has put behind bars.

Senior clerk in employment office, Mohammad Farukh, was picked up by police and sent to jail on that evening. His family members approached police with proof of his presence in the office after which Farukh was set free.

Three other men — Ateeq Ahmed, Shoib and Khalid — were also set free after it was found that they were taking their ill relative to a Meerut hospital when the clashes erupted.

Superintendent of police (SP) Satpal Antil said, “After an investigation, it was found that all the four men were not part of the mob. So, by using section 169 of the CrPC (Release of accused when evidence is deficient), all the four men were brought out from the jail.” The SP said a probe into all the cases was on, and no innocent man will be punished. “After the violence, we had detained a large number of people. We are looking into the matter very carefully and all the innocent people will be set free,” SP Antil said, adding, “Family members of accused can approach us if they feel someone was sent to jail mistakenly.”

Recently, Ladakh MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal has sent a text message to his Muzaffarnagar counterpart Sanjeev Baliyan requesting him to intervene and ensure the release of a youth from Kargil, Mohammed Ali, who was also put behind bars in the district. “I am told that he (Mohammed Ali) was not part of the protest but was picked up by police while he was entering the gate of his hostel. I sincerely request you to please examine personally and may kindly release him urgently,” Ladakh MP Namgyal said in his message to Baliyan.

Confirming it, Baliyan told TOI, “I have received a text message from the Ladakh MP, and I have discussed the matter with the police. Hopefully, the Kargil youth will walk free soon. I have asked the police to ensure that youths who were not involved in the violence do not suffer.”

Mohammed Ali, who is studying in Muzaffarnagar, was captured by police when he was entering the Sadat hostel, where police and protesters clashed. Several students from the hostel were arrested after the violence.

People protects themselves from cold near a bonfire on roadside in Patna on Tuesday

PATNA: After witnessing biting cold conditions over the past few days, Patna and most parts of the state are set to welcome the New Year amid rainy conditions as India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday issued forecast for rainfall in parts of state from January 1 to 4. Forecast for lightning has also been issued for January 2 and 3.

A Patna Meteorological Centre official said rainfall would occur mainly in southern parts of the state. “Cloud cover is expected to be observed in most parts of the state from the second half on Wednesday, but the showers are likely to remain confined in the southern districts. The intensity of showers will be comparatively higher on January 2 and 3 and it will start subsiding by January 4,” the official added.

The expected showers have been attributed to western disturbances – the weather systems originating from Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea and Caspian Sea – which cause snow and winter rainfalls in northwestern Indian subcontinent.

The official at local Met office said the western disturbance would form a cyclonic circulation over Haryana and trough line over Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. “This system will lead to rain primarily in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and comparatively lower in intensity over Bihar between January 1 and January 3,” he said.

Rains apart, IMD issued forecast for cold wave in Bihar on January 1.

Meanwhile, sub-10 temperatures continued to prevail in the state on Tuesday with minimum temperature in Patna plunging to 5 degrees C. Sabour in Bhagalpur remained the coldest place in Bihar for the second consecutive day with a minimum temperature of 2.6 degrees C.

In its daily weather bulletin issued on Tuesday, Patna Meteorological Centre stated that cold wave condition was observed at a few places and severe cold wave at many places in the state.

The local meteorological centre has issued a forecast for cold day condition in Patna and severe cold day condition in Purnia on Wednesday. Besides, forecast for cold wave condition has been issued for Gaya and Bhagalpur for Wednesday.

Cold day condition is declared when the minimum temperature touches 10 degrees C or low and there is a departure of 4.5-6.4 degrees C in maximum temperature on two consecutive days. Severe cold day, on the other hand, is declared when the minimum temperature touches 10 degrees C or low and there is a departure of more than 6.4 degrees C in maximum temperature.

Cold wave condition, on the other hand, is declared at a place when the normal minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or above but the actual temperature is recorded at seven degrees C or lower.

Tejashwi Prasad Yadav

PATNA: Leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Tuesday asked chief minister Nitish Kumar not to allow National Population Register (NPR) in the state till Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was repealed.

The Union cabinet had on January 24 approved funds for updating NPR and the exercise in this regard is to commence from April this year. Tejashwi tweeted, “Assuming turncoat, rudderless, fickle Nitish has an ounce of intent to not to implement NRC in Bihar , he must order suspension of preparation of national population register (NPR) with immediate effect until this unconstitutional law of #CAA is repealed! Walk the talk Mr CM! (sic).”

Even a day before, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, while addressing a rally against CAA and NPR in Kishanganj, had asked Nitish to pass an order against NPR and severe his ties with BJP.

When asked to comment, JD(U) national spokesperson KC Tyagi told TOI on Tuesday that the central government should clear the confusion of each and every person regarding NPR. “There are various talks going on about NPR and some are saying it is linked with NRC. This has also been said in Parliament earlier that NPR is the first step towards NRC. Now it is the government’s (central) job to clear these doubts. They must come very categorically to denounce all such statements,” Tyagi said. He also said his party will study NPR in detail and find out its probable impact on society.

But Tyagi rapped Tejashwi and said the RJD leader had little knowledge about Parliament functioning. “Once CAA has become a law, how can it be repealed? Also, can JD(U) do it single-handedly. It is very much clear that CAA is irrelevant without NRC and our chief minister Nitish Kumar has made it clear that there was no question of implementing NRC in Bihar. Tejashwi is uselessly raising this issue. If he (Tejashwi) gets the mandate and comes to power, let him repeal it,” Tyagi added.

PATNA: The sleuths of the Vigilance Investigation Bureau (VIB) arrested the BDO of Rajapakar block in Vaishali district Rajiv Ranjan on Tuesday on charges of accepting Rs1 lakh as bribe from a local resident for providing him documents pertaining to PACS election.

A team of bureau officials from the headquarters led by DSP Sarvesh Kumar Singh raided the office premises of the BDO at Rajapakar following a complaint lodged by Purushottam Kumar, a resident of Birnalakhan village under Mahua sub-division in Vaishali district.

The BDO was caught red handed while accepting Rs1 lakh as bribe from the complainant in the office. Rajiv Kumar, stated to be the husband of the mukhiya of Bakarpur panchayat, who was present in the BDO’s office at the time of the operation, was taken into custody by the bureau team for interrogation.

Both the BDO and the mukhiya’s husband were subsequently taken to Muzaffarpur. Earlier, Purushottam had lodged a complaint with the bureau office alleging that the BDO was demanding Rs 2 lakh as bribe for providing him documents related to PACS election.

The allegations against the BDO were found to be true during preliminary investigation. On Tuesday, a trap team led by DSP Singh carried out the raid at the BDO office and nabbed him soon after he accepted the bribe.

The money was seized from the BDO’s possession. Sources said that the mukhiya’s husband, Rajiv, had played an important role in finalizing the deal between the BDO and the complainant of the case. “Both the BDO and the mukhiya’s husband were being questioned by a team of officials in Muzaffarpur,” a senior bureau officer said in Patna.

He said the accused would be produced in the special vigilance court in Muzaffarpur after interrogation.

(File photo)

MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank on India ( RBI ) on Tuesday asked all urban co-operative banks (UCBs) with deposits of over Rs 100 crore to constitute a board of management (BoM) comprising experts to oversee their functioning which in turn will report to its board of directors (BoD).

The RBI also said that these banks should have a BoM for seeking approval to expand their area of operation and also open new branches. It also said that large UCBs should obtain prior approval of the RBI for appointment of their CEOs.

The change in rules came against the backdrop of a scam at the city-based PMC Bank that had over nine lakh depositors. The establishment of a BoM in addition to a BoD is aimed at separating the executive and supervisory roles in an UCB. Earlier, all these roles were vested with the BoD. “Since UCBs are accepting public deposits, it is imperative that a separate mechanism be put in place to protect the interests of depositors,” the RBI said in a circular.

The RBI asked all UCBs to constitute a BoM under the directions of its BoD within a year. A BoM should have a minimum of five members, excluding the CEO, and a maximum of 12 members. The CEO would be a non-voting member in the BoM. “The BoM shall exercise oversight over the banking related functions of the UCBs, assist the BoD on formulation of the policy and any other related matters specifically delegated to it by the BoD for proper functioning of the bank,” the circular said.

The guidelines also stipulate that the central bank will have powers to remove any member of BoM, including the CEO if the person is found to be not meeting the criteria prescribed by it or acting in a manner detrimental to the interests of the bank or its depositors or both.

MUMBAI: Bank credit to industry shrunk by 3.9%, or Rs 1.13 lakh crore, during the first eight months of the current financial year, according to data released by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ). Despite this, overall bank credit continues to be up 1% largely due to home loans and other personal loans.According to bankers, there is no fresh demand for bank credit for investment. At the same time, several corporates are trying to improve their financial position by deleveraging. This has partly been facilitated by reduction in corporate taxes and stake sales by some companies. As a result, bank credit to industry, which was Rs 28.85 lakh crore as of end March 2019, has fallen to Rs 27.7 lakh crore as on November 22, 2019.The biggest accretion to the bank’s loan books came from mortgages that grew by Rs 1.14 lakh crore to Rs 12.7 lakh crore. While overall loans in the personal segment (including home loans) grew 8.3% to Rs 24 lakh crore, contraction was seen in consumer loans, loans against FDs and shares.According to Soumya Kanti Ghosh , group chief economic adviser at SBI , there is indication that consumers are also reducing their borrowing. “During April-November 2019, the consumer leverage increased only marginally to Rs 65,337 crore as against Rs 62,886 crore during the corresponding period in previous fiscal. This means that consumer demand will continue to remain depressed till the time consumer leverage declines to comfortable levels,” he said.He added that a rate cut will, therefore, be unlikely to help arrest the current downturn and only a proactive fiscal policy could facilitate growth.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73055769,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-70922,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bank-credit-to-industry-slips-3-9-in-8-months/articleshow/73052140.cms

Representative image

MADURAI: The number of counting tables has been increased to 1,182 for counting of votes in the 13 unions where the local body polls were held on December 27 and 30. Election officials said that there were around 1,050 tables for the counting in these unions during the previous local body polls in 2011. The increase is to expedite declaration of results despite the tedious process of manual counting on Thursday (January 2).

It is learnt that in 2011, results for Thiruparankundram union were declared only the next day at 11.30 am after counting commenced. This is because of high number of electors in the union. There was similar delay in Melur union too. The 1,182 tables will be spread across 13 locations where ballot papers will be opened for counting. It includes the primary segregation tables and counting tables.

“A total of 3,965 officials will be involved in the counting process,” additional director (panchayat) A Chelladurai said. Votes will be first segregated for the panchayat ward member, panchayat president, union ward member and district ward member and will be tallied against the total votes polled. These ballot papers will then be taken to the respective tables for counting.

On the instructions of district collector and electoral officer T G Vinay, as many as 476 CCTV cameras have been installed at the counting halls for uninterrupted monitoring of the entire counting process and to avert confusions or clashes.

Fire tenders have been stationed at all the 13 counting centre. Heavy duty generators have also been kept ready at the counting centres for uninterrupted power supply. Barricades and metal meshes have been installed at counting centres to separate the counting officials from candidates and their agents. Police have stepped up security arrangements at the strong rooms and counting centres.

Kanyakumari district electoral officer Prashant M Wadnere expressed confidence that counting in Melpuram Union – the only union where EVMs were used for the local body polls in the state as a pilot project – will be completed way ahead of the other counting centres in the state. He said the votes polled in the 114 booths will be conducted in nine tables in 13 rounds.

“Counting in the EVMs will be done in three halls at three tables. Officials will first count and display votes polled for the panchayat ward member, followed by panchayat president, union ward member and district ward member. Once the counting is completed for the panchayat ward member and president in each table they will leave the room to give way for the candidates from other localities,” he said.

40,['1/01/2020'],A 5-year low: Fewer individual investors backed startups in 2019,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Chennai: As investible cash dried up due to economic slowdown, fewer number of new individual investors backed startups in 2019.

This comes at a time when PE/VC investments in startups were at record highs of $14.5 billion through 1,185 funding rounds as per data from research firm Tracxn.

2019 saw only 372 investors, hitting a 5-year-low since 2015 which saw 385 new investors. Last year, the percentage of first time investors dropped by 8% and the numbers have been seeing a downtrend after the initial jump in 2016, data shows.

Global angel network Keiretsu Forum’s Chennai and Singapore division saw 6 new investors join in 2019, while only 3 wrote cheques. In 2018, five new joined the network, but all had cut cheques for investments.

The forum’s co-president Rajan Srikanth said, “This clearly was a rough year with election uncertainty in the first part, and market volatility in the second. New angels may have been unsure of their own ability to evaluate deals, and probably were spooked a little by the hesitation they saw even from other more seasoned angels.”

Sanjay Swamy, managing partner, Prime Venture Partners said that the ecosystem was seeing fewer members for late stage investments.

“For series B and above, we need more investors coming on board even as the system continues to see new names among angel and early stage investors,” he said.

Market observers add that after the peak in 2018 — which saw an influx of foreign investors and new additions to the Indian funds — potential investors are taking a step back. “Besides, a lot of PE/VC funds raised capital in 2018 and are deploying them this year. It could be another reason to see a drop in the number of first time investors this year. And since the fundraising cycle happens roughly every 3 years, we would see fewer first time investors next year as well,” said Arun Natarajan, managing director, Venture Intelligence. The research firm also saw a similar drop in the number of first-time investors.

41,['1/01/2020'],Sterling Solar promoters repay Rs 1k cr,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Reeba Zachariah | TNN

Mumbai: Sterling and Wilson Solar said on Tuesday that its promoters — Shapoorji Pallonji and Company (SPCL) and Khurshed Daruvala — have repaid Rs 1,000 crore they owed to the firm. December 31 was the deadline for the promoters to repay part of their dues to Sterling Solar , the world’s largest engineering contractor of solar farms. The promoters now have to clear a balance of Rs 1,644 crore, which they intend to settle in a staggered manner by September 30, 2020.

The Rs 1,000-crore was used to retire the company’s debt, Daruvala, chairman of Sterling and Wilson Solar told TOI.

Another Rs 408-crore cash, which was generated by the company in the last five months, was used for the same purpose, he added. Sterling Solar now has a debt of Rs 1,440 crore, Daruvala said. SPCL’s financial challenges came to the fore in November when it sought time to repay dues it owed to Sterling Solar. It then raised Rs 742 crore by selling 37 lakh shares of TCS in two tranches in the open market. The company now holds 19.7 lakh TCS shares, representing 0.05% of the software giant’s equity.

SPCL had sought time to meet its financial obligations as it, like other real estate and infrastructure players, has been impacted by the liquidity crisis triggered by the collapse of IL&FS. This coupled with low realisation from Sterling Solar’s offer for sale (OFS) issue left the promoters in a spot.

Though Sterling Solar has low working capital requirements, the payment delay by promoters impacted the company’s share price. On Tuesday, Sterling Solar closed at Rs 324 on the NSE, up by 3%.

43,['1/01/2020'],"Fear of failure can freeze innovative ideas, progress","This story is from January 1, 2020

By Paul Dupuis

He was fired from the Kansas City Star with an editor’s scathing remark that he “lacked imagination and had no good ideas” as an animator. Unfazed, this young man bought an animation studio Laugh-O-Gram, but that had to fold up too.

Another young man faced the disappointment of being the only one of 24 applicants who failed to get a job at KFC. Neither could he get into Harvard in all the 10 times he applied. And his first two ventures met with failure. Do these stories spell failure? Seemingly so. But they were precursors to game-changing success — and both the young men went on to become iconic business leaders in their respective industries. The first was none other than Walt Disney, whose animation films and studios created and defined a genre. The second is Jack Ma, whose blockbuster e-commerce company Alibaba’s $150-billion IPO was the largest offering for a US-listed company in the history of the New York Stock Exchange.

There are many examples of leaders who experienced failure as a positive element in their saga of success. Their stories stand as testimonials to the fine line that waits to be stepped over between failure and success — the tipping point, you could call it.

Failing matters, if it creates value

Successful leaders know this profound truth only too well. The greatest failure lies not in the errors we make, but in fearing and assiduously avoiding the path of risk and possible errors. Here is an immense opportunity and potential to path-breaking success — do not limit yourself by a blinding apprehension of challenges in breaking the mould. Michael Jordan knew what he was saying when he asserted, “I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”

Assuredly, errors are integral to taking calculated risks. They are the result of out-of-the-box thinking to achieve unprecedented outcomes. They throw amazing insights into how to forge ahead as leaders. Because, success is not measured by how rarely you make mistakes — it is measured by how high you dare to set the bar and persevere to vault it.

Break free of a culture that only rewards perfectionism and penalises intelligent risk-taking when it fails. For this deters us from innovative thinking, looking ahead and moving forward. The value of failing is that it positively focuses on the upbeat excitement of trying and creating game-changing outcomes, and weans us away from the fear of failure that paralyses progress.

But beware: Failure is not always an honourable excuse

It is a paradox one cannot deny. Understanding success needs you to know failure. However, it is a trap too — the idealising failure as a ‘must have’ for success. It is one thing to take the stigma out of failure, and present it as an opportunity to transcend and transform. But it is quite another to treat it as a thoughtless badge of honour.

Of course, there are valuable lessons to be learnt from failure when we encounter them. But glorifying them makes us impervious to learning the more important lessons from the successes we achieve. For success is the reward for the meticulous diligence we demonstrate, and we need to define, plan and intelligently chip away at obstacles to achieve it. Hone your plans, skills, capabilities and execution for success, and build in how you will manage the odd failures to reach your goal.

And here is the true tipping point. Resilience in handling failure is a great attribute. But let us not fall into the comfort zone of exploiting it as an ultimate shield of emotional wallow. Let us aim to be gritty in handling failure, but let us primarily be smarter in planning for success with innovative and well-reasoned risks. Have a razor-sharp focus on success, but without the fear of failure.

In achieving our vision and goal, we have a choice. One is to wade through mistakes, and re-invent the wheel by trial and error. But here is a better option. Pursue your thirst for exploration and discovery. Tap into success factors of people who have cleared the thickets before us.

Imagine the great opportunity to smartly accelerate our journey into the exciting realms of the unknown. And this is what Sir Isaac Newton sums up beautifully in his classic quote, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”

PATNA: A police constable was crushed to death by a liquor-laden SUV on national highway-28 near Salona under the Barauli police station area in Gopalganj district early on Tuesday morning. The driver of the SUV, who hailed from Haryana , also died as the vehicle hit a speeding container while he was trying to flee from the spot.

Police seized a motorcycle of deceased constable Manoranjan Kumar and the SUV from the spot and sent the bodies for postmortem. A liquor smuggler, who was also travelling in the SUV, suffered serious injuries in the incident. He is undergoing treatment at the Gopalganj sadar hospital where his condition is stated to be critical.

The incident occurred around 5.30am when the SUV moving towards Muzaffarpur from Gopalganj hit the constable’s motorcycle having official logo of the police department on suspicion that he was following the car. The constable, who received multiple injuries, died on the spot.

The driver of the SUV, Sahil, then hit a container coming from opposition direction in a bid to flee from the site of occurrence and received serious injuries in the process. He also died on the spot.

SHO of Barauli police station Ritesh Mishra said the constable was on way to Masarakh in Chhapra from Gopalganj on his motorbike after delivering official letters. A native of Barharia village under the Masarakh police station in Saran district, the deceased constable was posted in Nawada .

The driver of the SUV was a resident of Khanpur Kala in Haryana’s Sonipat district. The identity of the injured is yet to be ascertained. “Locals, who had gathered in large number after the accident, took away the bottles of liquor from the SUV,” the SHO said.

The body of the constable was handed over to the family after guard of honour at the police lines. Gopalganj SP Manoj Kumar Tiwari said the police have lodged an FIR against the driver of the SUV. “The consignment of liquor booked from Haryana was to be delivered to a bootlegger in Muzaffarpur district,” the SP added.

GAYA: Gaya district administration has waived off the Rs 15 service charge for availing ‘ rainbasera ’ or night shelter services for the poor and other shelter seekers in view of the extreme cold conditions prevailing in the district.

There are seven night shelters in the Gaya Municipal Corporation area with a capacity of 250 beds, which can be doubled in times of emergency by arranging beds on the floor also. District magistrate Abhishek Singh said that apart from waiving off the service charge, the district administration has also distributed around 1600 blankets among the needy. “The distribution has been made randomly to those found shivering in the streets,” Singh said.

He added, “Circle officers have been directed to arrange bonfire in their respective blocks. Altogether 64 bonfires have been arranged in the Gaya Municipal Corporation area. Bonfires have also been arranged at some important places like Gaya railway station and Rai Kashinath More. Bonfires have also been arranged at 15 points in Bodh Gaya Nagar Panchayat and Tekari Nagar Panchayat areas and 10 points under the Sherghati Nagar Panchayat area.”

The DM also said that all schools in the district upto Class XII have been closed till January 5, 2020, even though no report of any cold-related death has been received from any part of the district so far.

Meanwhile, marginal increase in mercury in the night and sunshine in the day brought the much-needed relief to the people. According to India Metereological Department (IMD), as against the minimum temperature of 2.4 degrees Celsius recorded on Monday morning, the minimum temperature recorded on Tuesday was 3.9 degrees Celsius.

R-Block-Digha road construction in progress at Patna (File Photo)

PATNA: The state cabinet on Tuesday approved Rs 69.55 crore for the extension of R Block-Digha Road. The extended road will be 1.3km long and connect R Block-Digha road to the Ganga Pathway. The R Block-Digha Road was earlier supposed to be constructed up to Bankipore-Danapur road only.

Briefing media after the cabinet meeting, state road construction department principal secretary Amrit Lal Meena said the extended road will be connected through an elevated flyover. This will be the fourth flyover on this road. He also said construction work on this part of the road will be completed by August 15 this year.

In another proposal of the road construction department, the cabinet gave administrative approval of Rs236.65 crore for strengthening, widening and constructing the road between Noorsarai and Silao as per the revised estimate. Meena said this road was supposed to be seven metres wide, but now its width will be 10 metres. Two bypass roads will also be constructed for better and faster connectivity between Patna and Rajgir.

The cabinet also gave its approval for taking advance of Rs19.40 crore from Bihar contingency fund for the upcoming human chain event scheduled for January 19. The human chain will be formed across the state from 11:30am to 12 noon in support of the Jal-Jivan-Hariyali campaign of the Nitish Kumar government, and to sensitize people against child marriage and dowry. It was an education department’s proposal.

The cabinet approved the dismissal of 16 doctors who were found missing from their duty at public health centres for a long time. Altogether 21 agendas got the cabinet nod on the last day of the year.

Meanwhile, the state government has decided to celebrate the birth anniversary of former Union finance minister Arun Jaitley as state function on December 28 every year. Though this was announced by chief minister Nitish Kumar a few days after Jaitley’s death in August this year, the cabinet approved it on Tuesday. On December 28, Nitish unveiled life-size statue of Jaitley at a park in Kankarbagh area of the state capital. Jaitley’s wife Sangeeta Jaitley and their children were present during the event.

47,['1/01/2020'],Loan default: CBI raid on Rayapati,"This story is from January 1, 2020

VIJAYAWADA: The CBI on Tuesday conducted simultaneous searches on the offices and properties of former MP and TDP leader Rayapati Sambasiva Rao in Guntur and other places. The searches were conducted in connection with alleged disproportionate assets (DA) and also for defaulting on loans from various banks.

According to sources, the raids follow a complaint lodged by a consortium of banks led by Union Bank of India to CBI Banking Securities and Fraud Cell. In its complaint, the consortium alleged that construction firm Transstroy (India) Limited in which Sambasiva Rao allegedly had stakes, had defaulted in repayment of loans of Rs 300 crore. The raids began at around 6.30 am in Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, Guntur and Vijayawada .

During the raids, sleuths reportedly found details of huge transactions which were diverted to Transstroy Singapore PTE Limited, which is a subsidiary of the company.

“A case has been registered against Transstroy for cheating and criminal misappropriation. Executive members involved in the company had siphoned off around Rs 260 crore which came as a bank loan,” a senior official said.

Sources said that investigation by a six-member team was going on till Tuesday night. The team is looking into all transactional details.

Officials also reportedly found that money was spent in giving costly gifts worth Rs 5 crore which includes a diamond-studded gold saree to the presiding deity of Tiruchanoor temple in Tirupati .

However, officials are yet to confirm if the bank loan which was meant for Transstroy’s business was misused in purchasing them. Other transactions worth Rs 5.28 crore were made from the company’s accounts in purchasing gold and silver articles which once again allegedly strays from the loan’s purpose.

Apart from Sambasiva Rao, company managing director Cherukuri Sridhar and independent non-executive additional director Suryadevara Srinivasa Babji among others were named as the accused. The company was classified as a non-performing asset by the consortium way back in 2013 after Canara Bank audited the firm.

Sambasiva Rao contested the Lok Sabha polls in April this year on a TDP ticket but lost to his YSRCP rival. He was a member of the Lok Sabha four times. He was also a member of the Rajya Sabha for a term. Sambasiva Rao began his political career as a Congress worker and later became an MP on a Congress ticket from Guntur. He left Congress and joined the TDP in protest against bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014.

MUMBAI: The year 2019 will be remembered as a period when, although the two benchmark indices sensex and Nifty performed well and showed a low double-digit gain, not many retail investors made money. It will also be remembered as the year when both the sensex and Nifty rallied even as the country’s GDP growth rate went southward.Consider this: During 2019, sensex gained 14.4%, while the Nifty gained 12%, the broader BSE100 index was up 9.6% and BSE500 was up 7.8%. The gains in the sensex and the Nifty came despite a severe slide in the country’s economic growth rate, from 6.6% during July-September 2018 to 4.5% in July-September 2019.Data show that other than the promoters, institutions — foreign as well as domestic — hold large chunks of blue chips, while retail investors have large holdings in companies that are outside of the 50 companies that comprise the Nifty index. Since the sensex and the Nifty have outperformed the broader indices, it could be inferred that while institutional investors made money in 2019, the same can’t be said about retail investors, according to a dealer with a domestic brokerage.Data relating to market capitalisation also strengthens this argument. BSE’s market capitalisation rose from Rs 144.4 lakh crore to Rs 155.2 lakh crore — a jump of Rs 10.8 lakh crore. But in percentage terms, the rise was just 7.5% — almost half the rise in the sensex during the year. Mutual fund data also showed that largecap funds outperformed the mid and smallcap funds by a wide margin.However, interestingly, long-term debt funds outperformed even the largecap funds. Data also showed that during the year, returns from liquid funds were below their long-term average return.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73054960,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-83199,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/blue-chips-rally-but-smaller-cos-lag/articleshow/73052131.cms

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Only 14% of startups in India hire 10 employees or more in the first six months of their operations. Even after the business matured, as many as 60% still hired 10 employees or less.

According to a survey of 1,246 startups conducted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), only 3% of the startups hired more than 100 employees. Over 63% of the respondents also reported plans to hire at least 20 new employees in the next two to three years. These startups were mainly from software development, IT consulting/solution and health sectors, and were less than three years old.

The pilot survey on the startup sector was conducted by the RBI between November 2018 and April 2019. It was aimed at collecting information on select important characteristics of the startup sector. One of the key findings was that 75% of startups were concentrated in five states — Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Delhi and Tamil Nadu.

The annual turnover for more than a fourth of the respondents was up to Rs 10 lakh, whereas around 20% startups did not report any revenue generation. Less than a fifth of the respondents reported that their turnover exceeded Rs 1 crore. A third of the founders had an academic background in engineering. Most of the founders had professional experience and 7.3% of the founders were still students.

Startups in six sectors — agriculture, data & analytics, education, health, IT consulting/solution and manufacturing — accounted for nearly 50% of the survey respondents. Most of the startups had at least two co-founders.

Nearly 45% cent of the participating startups had at least one female founder. In all, 5.9% cent of the participating startups were founded by only females in comparison to 55.5% by only male founders. The remaining 38.6% of the participating startups had both male and female as co-founders.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Justice Hema commission , constituted to study the issues faced by women in film industry, has asked the state government to introduce a separate law to deal with issues in Malayalam film industry .

Confirming pervasiveness of ‘ casting couch ’ in the industry, commission has submitted a 300-page report to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday. The commission also attached a set of 1,500-page documents, including screenshots, voice clips and pen drives, as evidences along with the report.

The committee, headed by retired judge of high court Justice K Hema and actor Sharada and former bureaucrat K B Valsala Kumari as members, was constituted in June 2017 based on the petition filed by Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) to the chief minister to study the problems faced by women in Malayalam film industry. WCC met the chief minister following the actor assault case in 2017.

Justice Hema told TOI that the commission has suggested enactment of law to deal with several unique problems faced by the industry. “A separate tribunal should be constituted to hear a wide range of human rights violations in the industry. We came across serious issues such as soliciting sexual favours from aspiring actors for work. Commission has examined various witnesses, both men and women, and taken their statements and evidences. However, we have not mentioned any names in the report in order to ensure that the participants won’t face any harm from the industry,” she said.

A statement from the office of the chief minister said that the report has confirmed the issue of casting couch in cinema. “Several persons had to endure sexual harassment to get work. Most of the victims do not file police complaints,” it said.

(File photo)

MUMBAI: The country’s current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 0.9% of the gross domestic product (GDP) at $6.3 billion in the quarter ended September 2019 as imports slowed down due to lower demand. In the previous fiscal FY19, the CAD was 2.9% of GDP , or $19 billion, in the comparable quarter.

In the current fiscal’s preceding quarter ended June 2019, CAD was 2% of GDP or $14.2 billion. “The contraction in the CAD was primarily on account of a lower trade deficit at $38.1 billion as compared with $50 billion a year ago,” the RBI said in a statement.

India’s current account position is largely on a deficit because of the country’s dependence on oil imports. According to data released by the central bank, the net deficit due to oil imports shrunk to $19.3 billion from $23.5 billion.

The CAD is the difference between foreign exchange inflows and outflows. Private transfer receipts, mainly representing remittances by Indians employed overseas, rose to $21.9 billion, increasing by 5.2% from their level a year ago.

In the financial account, net foreign direct investment was $7.4 billion, almost the same level as in Q2 of 2018-19. Foreign portfolio investment recorded net inflows of $2.5 billion — as against an outflow of $1.6 billion in Q2 of FY19 — because of net purchases in the debt market. Net inflows on account of external commercial borrowings to India was $3.2 billion as compared with $2.0 billion in Q2 of 2018-19.

The balance of payment stood at $5.12 billion in the second quarter and $19.1 billion during the first half of this fiscal. The net inflow on account of external commercial borrowings to the country was $3.2 billion in the second quarter as compared with $2 billion in corresponding period of the previous financial year.

MUMBAI: Businesses with turnover of Rs 50 crore and above that do not provide digital payment facilities to their customers will be fined Rs 5,000 per day from February 2019, according to a government notification.

In a circular issued on Tuesday, the Central Board of Direct Taxes ( CBDT ) said that with effect from January 1, 2020, businesses must provide the facilities for accepting payment through the prescribed electronic modes. The government and the RBI have already directed banks to waive charges for electronic payments online. The proposal requiring businesses with turnover of Rs 50 crore to provide digital payment platform was mooted by the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Budget in July 2019.

Subsequently, the Finance Act was amended to include section 271 DB in the Act, which provides for levy of penalty of Rs 5,000 per day in case of failure by the specified person to comply with the provisions of section 269SU.

“In order to allow sufficient time to the specified person to install and operationalise the facility for accepting payment through the prescribed electronic modes, the penalty under section 271 DB of the Act shall not be levied if the specified person installs and operationalises the facilities on or before January 31, 2020,” the circular said.

The government also notified its proposal to waive MDR on payments made through RuPay and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and UPI QR code from January 1, 2020. Meanwhile the ministry of electronics and information technology said that it was discontinuing a scheme where it reimbursed MDR charges of value up to Rs 2,000 fro transactions made through debit cards, Bhim and Aadhaar pay and on payments up to Rs 1 lakh made to the government.

The department said that as the finance ministry circular has barred MDR charges on RuPay and UPI the MDR reimbursement schemes are being closed from December 31’ 2019.

From gates bedecked with flowers to pandals illuminated with lights and sounds of hymns and prayers at every nook and corner, the tent city has set a different atmosphere for the devotees.

Spread in an area of 30 acres, the tent city has ‘langar’ halls, bedrooms, VIP lounges, stages and all necessary facilities for the convenience of the devotees.

More than 10,000 pilgrims from across the country and abroad have reached the city for the celebrations. “At least 5,000 devotees have been accommodated at Kangan Ghat tent city and the others at various gurdwaras here. Around 13 government schools are also being used for the stay of pilgrims,” said a member of Takhat Sri Harmandir Sahib Prabhandhak Committee.

Divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on Tuesday visited Kangan Ghat tent city and inspected the arrangements there. “More than 1,000 police officers from Patna and Vaishali have been deployed in and around the tent city for the safety of pilgrims. Besides, constant monitoring is being done through surveillance cameras,” Agarwal said, adding 27 ambulances have also been arranged for the pilgrims.

All gurdwaras in the city, including Takhat Sri Harmandir Patna Sahib Gurdwara, Gurdwara Sri Gai Ghat Sahib, Guru Ka Bagh Gurdwara and Bal Leela Gurdwara have been decked up with flowers and illuminated with lights.

The Takhat Sri Harmandir Patna Sahib Gurdwara, which is the birthplace of Guru Gobind Singh, witnessed large crowd of devotees throughout the day on Tuesday. “Guru Gobind Singh, the founder of the warrior Sikh community, Khalsa, had hugely contributed to Sikhism,” said M S Dhillon, secretary of Takhat Sri Harmandir Patna Sahib Gurdwara Prabhandhak Committee.

He added that thousands of devotees visited the gurdwara at 4am on Tuesday to participate in ‘badi prabhat pheri’. “More than 10,000 devotees participated in the procession. Apart from devotees, five gatkas performed martial arts. Horses, camels and elephants were the major attractions. The procession originated from Takhat Sri Harimandir Ji Patna Sahib Gurdwara at 4am and culminated there after passing through different areas of the city,” Dhillon said.

55,['1/01/2020'],House of Mrinal Sen to be sold,"It is said one dies twice in life. First, when the heartbeat stops. Then, sometime later, when one’s name is uttered for the last time. On his first death anniversary, when one entered the Padmapukur flat of Mrinal Sen that has been home to 15 years of intellectual brainstorming, it was amply clear that the master-director had well and truly cheated death the second time around even though he had long stopped breathing.This game of hide-and-seek with death actually started some time back when his Chicago-based son and daughter-in-law, Kunal and Nisha, took a unique decision to distribute his belongings and awards among anyone who cared to look after them. The couple does not have children and back in Chicago, they have already made a pact with a group of friends and signed on a living will that allows the “plug to be pulled” if they are in a vegetative state. Living light with a sense of detached attachment is perhaps a conscious choice on their part. “Both Nisha and I know that we are at a die-able age. We might live for another 20 years or so but it’s also a fact that anything can happen any time. Since we live abroad, we are aware that when we die, no one knows how our house will be cleared,” he said.It isn’t difficult to understand the choice when one listens to the couple speak. Sometime back, Left Front chairperson Biman Basu came over and took Sen’s hospital bed that he used at home. It was then given over to the People’s Relief Committee. Berhampore Film Society has taken his telephone and specs for preservation. Some 422 books were picked up by Uttarpara-based archivist Arindam Saha Sardar. A cupboard full of mementos was left ajar for anyone to pick them up while old family acquaintances and young cine-lovers queued up to collect what they will show their grandchildren as their most precious collection. Even the two cots in the master bedroom that were once used by Mrinal and wife Gita awaited a kind soul to pick them up. Three prospective buyers have already had talks about buying the flat but nothing has yet been signed on the dotted line.On Monday evening, Kunal and Nisha sat in the centre of the room where Sen would once sit to watch television while the latter’s acquaintances dropped by to pay their respect to the legend. According to Kunal, maintaining the house in his father’s absence had become a challenge. Once, they returned to find a broken window pane. On another occasion, leakage started from a portion of the damaged ceiling. The third occasion was the most irritating. The couple had just arrived in Kolkata and had quite a lot of soiled clothes. After putting them inside the washing machine, they went out to have food. Shock of their lives awaited them on their return when they found water from the washing machine had flooded the flat and was dripping down the staircase to the third floor! “Though terribly jetlagged, we sat till well past midnight cleaning up the mess by soaking towels in the water!” they recalled.Though the original home was never ostentatious, it wasn’t this minimal either. Only a few chairs remain in the sitting area. Few photographs hang on the wall. The book shelves in the study lie empty. His books have more or less been packed to be sent off to Uttarpara. A grey refrigerator stands tall in the dining area but the wooden table in the centre where the legendary director would occasionally sit in the mornings to glance through the newspaper is missing. The television, which in the last days of his life even screened Bollywood films (earlier on, it was a strict no-no), was still there. And beside it hung a huge sepia-toned photograph of Mrinal — something that Kunal was a little undecided about whom to gift.It was not an overnight decision to dispose off the flat that had been the director’s address for the last 15 years. “I always knew this would happen,” Kunal said. Of course, the flat could have been turned into a museum of sorts. But returning to a half-functional house-turned-museum is not a terribly exciting idea. Since Kunal and Nisha live abroad and chances of their personal supervision on a regular basis are rather slim, there was always the fear of returning to a flat with cobwebs and layers of dust accumulating on precious belongings. “We didn’t want that to happen,” he added, as old-time family acquaintances like Ina Puri and Samik Bandopadhyay dropped by.What made things a little simpler was that the icon had not really left behind too many precious belongings. Years back, while moving apartments, he had disposed most of his papers. Fortunately, the important awards were kept in the locker. “He never kept things in order. Letters would pile up on his desk and the day Ma would start screaming at him, he would just bind all of them with a rope and stack the lot under the bed. This process continued for years. When we had to move apartments, it was impossible for anyone to sort important ones,” Kunal recalled.So, a call went to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and the then mayor, Subrata Mukherjee, had sent across a truck with two people. “They threw away almost everything, including the scripts. So, this house practically doesn’t have any of those old letters. While throwing away the stuff, someone told him to check a rather big packet that had stuff which made a ‘dhong-dhong’ sound. That packet contained some of his minor awards!”On his last visit to Kolkata, the couple had taken his Padmabhushan, the Silver Bear from Berlin, the French award (Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres) and an award bestowed on Gita Sen. This time around, they intend to take some others back. “For Chorus, the Russians had given an award shaped as a solid sphere. It was so heavy that when he was given that award, he had literally dropped it. This time, I want to carry that along with a few others,” Kunal said.On his earlier visit, film archivist Shivendra Singh Dungarpur had collected Mrinal’s kurta, pen and chair for his foundation. “On this recent visit, he took film stills and major awards. That includes the Dadasaheb Phalke , Filmfare and many National Awards. Initially, I am taking all the international awards and keeping them with myself. I plan to donate 80% of them right away to University of Chicago and Stanford University. I will keep the rest at home for sometime and subsequently give them away. Four hundred years later, even if someone wants to see them, I am certain that they will be preserved well by these two universities,” Kunal said.Some personal things still remain in the bedroom. His handwritten letters haven’t survived but other communications from the digital age have. “When I thought a communication could be important, I kept a printout of the email,” Kunal said. The exchanges are important but like all printouts, they lack the personal touch. Two “treatments” of films that he never made have survived. Besides, there is a diary of sorts that has details like laundry bills and travel dates. Nisha, meanwhile, has collected his passports and checked the stamps to keep record of where he went when. “I also took some of his books from his collection of 3,000 works. Apart from Arindam, there are others who have taken some 50 more,” he added. What about his starch-white kurtas and shawls? “Some had specifically asked for his shawls and we gave them away. The rest, which could be used, were given away to common people. Nandita (Das) had wanted a shawl and we have kept one for her,” he said. Anything for Shabana Azmi ? “She never asked for anything. It is hard for me to presume who will want anything and I do not want to burden anyone,” he pointed out.There are some letter exchanges that Kunal is personally annotating. “May be, something he had written on a chit of paper. I am currently annotating these. One third of it is done already. Once complete, I will distribute them too.”When dusk settled down, one of Mrinal’s favourite actors — Mamata Shankar — walked in. Nisha ushered her inside and gave her a beautiful white idol of Shiv and Parvati. “Ma used to worship this at home. I have kept it for you. Ma’s puja resulted out of a feeling somewhere in between fear and faith. But Bondhu (Kunal addresses his father that way) would always tease her about it. I am 65 and have always seen this at home,” Kunal said. A visibly moved Shankar added, “This is a huge thing for me. For me, it symbolises Mrinalda and boudi. Amar thakurer ashonei rakhbo…” Later in the evening, actor Dhritiman Chaterji dropped by as well to share memories.Giving away personal belongings isn’t easy. More so, if one has to relinquish the rights of inheritance and willingly turn personal possessions into public property. “These are personal threads. I know now my connection with my parents will be at a conceptual level. I tried to take a long perspective and see if some of the materials will be available hundreds of years from now for scholarly research. I don’t know if there will be any interest in him in even 50 years, but I’d rather the future decide that. I think what we are doing is probably what my parents would have liked us to do. Neither of them liked pomp and show nor any fuss around them,” said Kunal. But by donating these to one and all, Kunal has given strangers a chance to create personal memories of the master. The hospital bed that might be used by a patient who perhaps had no connection whatsoever with Mrinal and his movies, the Shiv Parvati idol that will get a pride of position in Shankar’s puja room, the mementos that will now sit pretty on some cine-lover’s drawing room will ensure that his name continues to resonate, cheating death forever.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73046635,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-97585/73046635.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/bengali/movies/news/house-of-mrinal-sen-to-be-sold/articleshow/73046635.cms

58,['1/01/2020'],All is well between JD(U) and BJP: CM Nitish Kumar,"This story is from January 1, 2020

CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Tuesday tried to ward off speculations about a growing conflict with ally BJP and said, “Sab theek hai ( all is well ).”

Nitish’s remark came just an hour after his party’s senior leader and poll strategist Prashant Kishor made a frontal attack on senior BJP leader and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi . “Modi became deputy CM by virtue of circumstances despite his party’s defeat in 2015 elections,” Kishor tweeted.

Journalists sought Nitish’s reaction on the growing differences between his party and BJP over Kishor’s recent assertion that JD(U) must be given larger number of seats in the coming state assembly election due this year because it is a bigger party (than the BJP) in Bihar and the state election would be contested on the face value of Nitish.

Trouble between the two NDA allies began on Sunday after Kishor told media persons that since the assembly election will be contested on the face of Nitish, hence the ratio of seat sharing between BJP and JD(U) cannot be 1:1. “The basis of seat-sharing talks between BJP and JD(U) should be 1:1.4 or may be 1:1.3,” he said.

Kishor has raised his voice against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act despite JD(U) backing the bill in Parliament and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Though Nitish claims all is fine in the NDA, political pundits have started analysing the sudden developments, especially after Jharkhand election results. “The way PK is attacking the Centre on every consecutive day indicates that he is doing it out of some well-planned strategy,” said N K Choudhary, social scientist and former head of economics department at Patna University. “I believe PK is speaking Nitish’s words as the latter is trying to extract the outcome of possible political churning and finalize the seat- sharing with the BJP much to his interest as early as possible, as he did it before the 2019 general elections,” he said.

Nevertheless, reacting over Kishor’s argument on seat-sharing, Sushil Modi on Monday made a stinging remark while reminding him of “his business of collating political data and coining slogans”. Modi tweeted on Monday: “There is no problem in seat sharing. But those who have entered politics not driven by ideology but while engaged in the ‘business of collating political data and coining slogans’ are making utterances in violation of ‘gathbandhan dharma’ and benefiting the opposition’s alliance in the bargain. --- A person engaged in a profitmaking business first prepares his market for his service, he thinks about the interest of country in later stage (sic).”

Kishor’s statement has also been criticized within his party. “Two things are clear about the 2020 polls. First, election will be fought under the leadership of Nitish Babu. Second, seat sharing is not something that will be decided in full media glare,” JD(U) general secretary (Organisation) RCP Singh said on Monday at Manpur in Gaya district, while voicing disapproval of Kishor’s statement.

BJP state president Sanjay Jaiswal has also questioned Kishor. “The seat-sharing issue will be decided by the top leadership of both the parties. Is Kishor the party president of JD(U)? Who is he?” Jaiswal told reporters on Monday.

MUMBAI: Only 14% of startups in India hire 10 employees or more in the first six months of their operations. Even after the business matured, as many as 60% still hired 10 employees or less.According to a survey of 1,246 startups conducted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), only 3% of the startups hired more than 100 employees. Over 63% of the respondents also reported plans to hire at least 20 new employees in the next two to three years. These startups were mainly from software development, IT consulting/solution and health sectors, and were less than three years old.The pilot survey on the startup sector was conducted by the RBI between November 2018 and April 2019. It was aimed at collecting information on select important characteristics of the startup sector. One of the key findings was that 75% of startups were concentrated in five states — Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Delhi and Tamil Nadu.The annual turnover for more than a fourth of the respondents was up to Rs 10 lakh, whereas around 20% startups did not report any revenue generation. Less than a fifth of the respondents reported that their turnover exceeded Rs 1 crore. A third of the founders had an academic background in engineering. Most of the founders had professional experience and 7.3% of the founders were still students.Startups in six sectors — agriculture, data & analytics, education, health, IT consulting/solution and manufacturing — accounted for nearly 50% of the survey respondents. Most of the startups had at least two co-founders.Nearly 45% cent of the participating startups had at least one female founder. In all, 5.9% cent of the participating startups were founded by only females in comparison to 55.5% by only male founders.

60,['1/01/2020'],Man with ‘towel gun’ loots Rs 9 lakh from Patna bank,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: In a daring, daylight heist, bang in the middle of the state capital, a masked man walked into a public sector bank branch on the bustling Station Road near Patna junction, pointed a gun wrapped in a towel at the cashier, and coolly walked away with Rs 9.12 lakh in cash on Tuesday afternoon.

It took him just two minutes to loot the bank. And, as it turned out, he was perhaps not even carrying a gun. The robber had wrapped a thick towel around his right arm, which the shaken cashier assumed, to be a firearm.

City SP (central) Vinay Tiwary said, “The robber entered the bank at 3.04pm and exited at 3.06pm. Police reached the spot at 3.11pm.”

Patna SSP Garima Malik said that the investigators suspect the masked robber was pretending to carry a gun. “He was spotted putting cash in a bag with both his hands. But there is no evidence of him keeping aside any firearm anywhere in the CCTV footage before stuffing the money in the bag,” said Malik, adding, it appears the robber knew the branch well as he was moving around with familiarity.

Jitendra Kumar, an eye witness, told TOI that the criminal had wrapped a thick towel around his palm and wrist making it difficult to make out if he had a pistol hidden or not.

“Pointing it, he threatened all of us to move inside. His face was covered. There was a power cut when he entered the branch,” Kumar said.

There were at least 25 people, including 15 bank employees, inside the branch when the loot took place. No alarm was activated even after the loot. In addition, the branch has been functioning without any security personnel. With this loot on the last day of the year, the tally of bank loots across the state reached 14, which is the second highest since 2014 and 2015. Maximum 21 bank robbery incidents were reported in 2011.

SSP Malik said the role employees would be investigated as the cashier himself was spotted holding the bag in which the robber was putting in the cash.

Despite bone-chilling cold, revellers gather at Manali to celebrate New Year’s Eve

CHANDIGARH/SHIMLA: Intense cold continued in Punjab and Haryana on New Year’s Eve, with Narnaul recording the lowest temperature of 2.3 degrees Celsius — three degrees below the normal temperature. Union Territory Chandigarh, the joint capital of two states, recorded a minimum of 4.8 degree C, one notch below normal on Tuesday.

The cold was so severe that in Jalandhar, a man is suspected to have died because of it. He was found dead outside a shutdown factory in Sodhal Nagar area of Jalandhar on Monday. Police have kept his body in the mortuary as the man could not be identified.

According to the meteorological department, parts of Himachal Pradesh recorded freezing temperatures, with the state’s lowest temperature recorded in Keylong at minus 8.2 degrees Celsius. The met office has predicted snowfall and rain in the middle and higher hills of the state from December 31 to January 4. Snowfall is most likely to occur in higher hills of Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur districts on December 31 and January 1 whereas in the middle hills of Shimla, Kufri and Manali on January 2 and 3, the director of IMD’s Shimla meteorological centre, the met office said.

But irrespective of the cold, visitors thronged Himchali towns, particularly Manali and Shimla, to usher in their new year. This brought cheer among hoteliers but also traffic jams to the state.

The vehicles from other states, especially from Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh and Uttar Pradesh, made a beeline to Manali that choked roads of not just Kullu-Manali but the whole Kiratpur-Manali highway. The main problem that tourists faced was inadequate parking. Tourists had to drive many kilometers in search of a parking space. Himachal Pradesh police have tightened security arrangements to ensure smooth flow of vehicular traffic and to maintain law and order.

Weather was mainly dry over the state in the last 24 hours with minimum temperatures 1 to 2 degrees below normal.

The MeT office has predicted snowfall and rain in the middle and higher hills of the state from December 31 to January 4.

Shimla recorded 1.2 degrees Celsius and Kalpa in Kinnaur district registered a low of minus 3 degrees Celsius, Kufri, Manali, Solan and Dalhousie shivered at minus 1.8, minus 1.4, minus 0.6 and minus 0.4 degrees Celsius respectively.

Hisar shivered at 4.5 degrees Celsius, Ambala 4.6 degrees Celsius, Rohtak 4.8 degrees Celsius, Sirsa 4.9 degrees Celsius and Karnal at 5 degrees Celsius.

In Punjab, Amritsar, Ludhiana and Patiala braved chill at a low of 3.4, 4.1 and 4.6 degrees Celsius, respectively. Pathankot, Adampur, Bathinda and Halwara recorded their minimums at 3.5, 3.6, 4.2 and 4.6 degrees Celsius, respectively. Dense fog descended at several places, including Patiala, Pathankot and Gurdaspur, reducing visibility.

Dharamshala: The Union government has authorised the Regional Forensic Science Laboratory (RFSL), Northern Range, Dharamshala, to examine electronic devices, particularly mobiles and hard disks — making it the first in the region to do so. Now, reports of this lab will be admissible for trials across the country. The lab has also qualified the Korean quality parameters of document examinations.

A communication to this effect was sent by the South Korea national forensic institute to the forensic directorate of Himachal Pradesh on December 17. Korean forensic authorities had sent samples for examination to Dharamshala lab on September 9, for which reports were sent on September 30.

Forensics deputy director Dr Meenakshi Mahajan, when contacted, confirmed that the lab has matched the Korean quality parameters and added that the Union ministry of electronics and information technology has also notified it (lab) as an examiner of electronic evidence under Section 79A of the IT Act 2000.

“The lab is the first in the northern part of the country to get notified from the Union government. A notification regarding this has also been issued,” she said.

This lab, which became functional in 2008, caters to Kangra, Chamba and Una districts of Himachal Pradesh.

Tribesmen carry the body of Soman wrapped in a mat through the forest in Kunjippara.

KOCHI: Kerala State Human Rights Commission ( KSHRC ) has sought a report from the state government over the incident where the tribal people in eastern part of Ernakulam were forced to carry a man’s body around 3km on foot for postmortem in hospital due to the lack of proper roads to their settlement.

The commission registered a suo moto case based on the news reports about the incident. KSHRC chairman Justice Antony Dominic directed the state chief secretary and Ernakulam collector to file a report within three weeks. After receiving the report, the case will be considered during the sitting in Aluva.

The body of the tribesman, Soman (37), who allegedly committed suicide at his house in Kunjippara tribal hamlet in Kuttampuzha in Ernakulam last week, had to be carried on foot by his fellow tribesmen after the inquest by police. The tribesmen had to carry the body on their shoulders after wrapping it in a mat and tying it to a bamboo pole to take it to the nearest road.

District police chief (Ernakulam Rural) K Karthick said that the police reached the hamlet on foot after walking through the forests for kilometres.

“I have enquired about the incident. Electricity supply and road connectivity is yet to reach Kunjippara tribal settlement which is located deep in the forests in Kuttampuzha. Though the inquest was completed, there was no way to bring the body by jeep. Later it was carried on shoulders and taken across a river and shifted to a jeep which took it to the main road where the ambulance was waiting. The body was then taken in the ambulance to the Kothamangalam taluk hospital for autopsy,” he said.

The district collector was not available for the comment.

CHANDIGARH/SHIMLA: Intense cold continued in Punjab and Haryana on New Year’s Eve, with Narnaul recording the lowest temperature of 2.3 degrees Celsius — three degrees below the normal temperature. Union Territory Chandigarh, the joint capital of two states, recorded a minimum of 4.8 degree C, one notch below normal on Tuesday.

The cold was so severe that in Jalandhar, a man is suspected to have died because of it. He was found dead outside a shutdown factory in Sodhal Nagar area of Jalandhar on Monday. Police have kept his body in the mortuary as the man could not be identified.

According to the meteorological department, parts of Himachal Pradesh recorded freezing temperatures, with the state’s lowest temperature recorded in Keylong at minus 8.2 degrees Celsius. The met office has predicted snowfall and rain in the middle and higher hills of the state from December 31 to January 4. Snowfall is most likely to occur in higher hills of Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur districts on December 31 and January 1 whereas in the middle hills of Shimla, Kufri and Manali on January 2 and 3, the director of IMD’s Shimla meteorological centre, the met office said.

But irrespective of the cold, visitors thronged Himchali towns, particularly Manali and Shimla, to usher in their new year. This brought cheer among hoteliers but also traffic jams to the state.

The vehicles from other states, especially from Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh and Uttar Pradesh, made a beeline to Manali that choked roads of not just Kullu-Manali but the whole Kiratpur-Manali highway. The main problem that tourists faced was inadequate parking. Tourists had to drive many kilometers in search of a parking space. Himachal Pradesh police have tightened security arrangements to ensure smooth flow of vehicular traffic and to maintain law and order.

Weather was mainly dry over the state in the last 24 hours with minimum temperatures 1 to 2 degrees below normal.

The MeT office has predicted snowfall and rain in the middle and higher hills of the state from December 31 to January 4.

Shimla recorded 1.2 degrees Celsius and Kalpa in Kinnaur district registered a low of minus 3 degrees Celsius, Kufri, Manali, Solan and Dalhousie shivered at minus 1.8, minus 1.4, minus 0.6 and minus 0.4 degrees Celsius respectively.

65,['1/01/2020'],Second rhino death due to infighting in Dudhwa this year,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Shahjahanpur: The carcass of a 6-year-old male Indian single-horned rhinoceros was recovered from South Sonaripur range of Dudhwa National Park on Tuesday morning. According to forest officials, there were multiple injuries on its body, probably caused by another male rhinoceros. This is the second rhino death in Dudhwa.

A panel of five veterinarians, including Dr Utkarsh Shukla from Lucknow Zoo, conducted the autopsy and confirmed that the rhino died due to infighting. They ruled out poaching as its horn was intact. Forest department officials who inspected the carcass said they saw foot marks of an adult rhino nearby. In February, a 15-year-old rhino was killed by a relatively younger bull in the national park due to infighting.

The Indian single-horned rhino is listed as ‘vulnerable’ in the IUCN Red List. Today, its population has dwindled to about 2,700 across India and Nepal. Indian rhino is also included in schedule-I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972

With the death of the rhino, Dudhwa now has 38 left in two enclosures – 34 in Kakraha compartment of Sonaripur range and four in Belraya range of DTR. Of these, 29 are cows and just five bulls are left. Besides, there are four calves in Sonaripur.

Field director Sanjay Pathak told TOI, “We used to call the deceased rhino the fourth son of Narayani and it was possibly killed by an adult rhino. We are yet to identify the pachyderm that killed it. It may be injured and in need of treatment.”

Rhinos were translocated from Assam to Dudhwa in 1984 and kept in a 27-sq km enclosure in Kakraha in Sonaripur range. In 2018, Dudhwa successfully launched it second rhino rehabilitation programme by shifting three females and one male rhino from Sonaripur to a 20-km enclosure in DTR’s Belraya range.

Most of the rhinos in Dudhwa are offsprings of Bankey, its oldest rhino who died at the age of 50 of natural causes in December 2016. A year later, three-year-old Sehdev was killed by three tigers. Earlier this year, 15-year-old Bhimsen died during infighting.

70,['1/01/2020'],Our generation is less judgemental and more tolerant,"This story is from January 1, 2020

As a person born in the new millennium, I feel that what set us apart from the generation of our parents is we are less judgemental, more tolerant and better networked.

The perception that millennials are socially disconnected and aloof has been proved wrong multiple times, but still the society clings to the stereotyped image of us as being loners, who are always glued to mobile phones and social media.

Kerala had seen young millennials in action when they brought people together for relief operations during the floods. Now, they are hitting the streets to protest against Citizenship Amendment Act. We, as a generation, can unite people because we are more open minded.

While most of us are politically conscious, the issue is that there is no proper platform in national institutions like NIT to voice our opinion or raise objections against the decisions of authorities, if need arises. Even the government is trying to suppress student voices in institutions like JNU. I think that more people from the campuses should enter national politics as the age-gap between the current crop of national leaders and our generation is massive.

On career front, I think our generation is not driven by salary prospects alone while making career choices. Some of my colleagues have even left NIT after realizing that their interests lie elsewhere, like arts and literature. At the end of the day, we need to be happy and satisfied. We are ready to take risks to follow our passion.

I think that our lot are more goal-oriented and would like to align our family lives to our goals. The girls of my generation would take decisions about marriage only if they like it. Also, I think that traditional gender roles are changing rapidly in our generation as it is increasingly becoming normal for men to do household chores along with women.

I think 90% of the girls in our group don’t know cooking, but I know many boys who are good at it. Also, if two people get along well and share the same interests, then other factors like caste of religion are becoming less of a hindrance now, at least for dating.

BAREILLY: A group of five dacoits stormed into a house and decamped with cash and jewellery after locking the family up in a room at gunpoint. The incident occurred on the outskirts of Bareilly city early on Tuesday.

The dacoits targeted the house of Ram Naresh situated in Shivganga colony of Izzatnagar area at 1 am when the family was sleeping.

Police said an FIR has been lodged against five unidentified accused and anti-dacoity and surveillance teams of crime branch have been deployed along with local police to resolve the case at the earliest.

The house owner, Ram Naresh, who works as an insurance company agent, said he and his family members were sleeping when five armed dacoits forcefully entered his house through roof and woke them up. They were asked to give up their cash and jewellery at gunpoint.

After sweeping all the expensive items, dacoits tied their hands and locked them in a room. They also took away their mobile phones to ensure that they couldn’t contact anyone. On Tuesday morning, neighbours rescued the family and police were informed.

Izzatnagar station house officer AK Verma said, “An FIR has been registered against unidentified robbers under IPC section 395 (dacoity) and we are trying to identify the gang involved in the crime. There must be someone who would have done reconnaissance for the dacoits and he could be the connecting link. Forensic team has collected the samples of finger prints and we will try to match them with our list of robbers active in Bareilly.”

Arvind Kejriwal

NEW DELHI: As the assembly election draws near , Aam Aadmi Party MLAs have intensified their micro-level canvassing . Organised at different places within the assembly constituencies, the ‘mohalla sabhas’ are being used by MLAs to closely connect with voters.

The AAP government’s report card, which lists major achievements of the government in the last five years, is distributed among the public during the meetings and discussions are held.

AAP came to power in 2015 winning 67 out of 70 assembly seats. It currently has 61 MLAs as the party lost the Rajouri Garden seat in a by-election to BJP and five MLAs were disqualified under anti-defection laws.

The MLAs of the party have been asked to focus on small meetings. Each MLA has to conduct 10 ‘mohalla sabhas’ before January 6 so that they are able to clearly explain to the public the major achievements of the government.

CM Arvind Kejriwal had recently launched the report card of his government describing its top 10 achievements. The report card is a major part of the party’s campaign for the upcoming assembly elections and is being taken to 35 lakh households in the city.

Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh on Tuesday welcomed a group of local functionaries from BJP, Congress and Lok Janshakti Party into the party fold and said that AAP will repeat the historic victory of 2015 in the upcoming polls. “People from across the political parties are joining AAP influenced by the government’s achievements. In the report card, we have shown how the honest governance of AAP has resulted in people of Delhi getting free electricity, water, education, health facilities and all the other basic amenities to live a life of dignity. Many are overwhelmed with such a governance model,” said Singh.

“He (the chief priest) was disappointed with the Pilibhit police for booking Sikh devotees. We took out the Sankirtan (religious procession) in Delhi, on the same occasion, that was joined by over 3 lakh devotees and lasted for 16 hours, but there was no hindrance from the administration,” Sirsa said.

However, Dixit said he clearly stated to Sirsa that the booked devotees would not be harassed, but they would be subject to go through legal procedures.

“The matter should not be viewed by the Sikh leaders from the religious angle, but from the viewpoint of law, which is equally applicable to everyone without any discrimination”, the SP said.

KANNUR: The aerial survey to identify the alignment of the Thiruvananthapuram-Kasaragod semi high-speed railway ( SHSR ) project got under way on Tuesday, covering the northernmost 80km stretch from Kannur in the initial phase.

The aerial survey will be completed in seven days for the entire 532-km stretch up to Thiruvananthapuram, marking the first vital step before commencing the work of the project, named Silver Line, said an official release. This line will reduce the end-to-end travel time to four hours.

LiDAR (light detection and ranging) aerial remote sensing method is being used for the survey, conducted on a Partenavia P68 series aircraft that took off from Kannur International Airport (Kial).

A joint venture of the Kerala government and ministry of railways, the project had obtained the in-principle approval of the Centre on December 17, said the release.

The survey is being carried out by Hyderabad-based GeoKno India Pvt Ltd, which had also conducted LiDAR survey for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project.

According to V Ajith Kumar, managing director, Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd, the implementing agency of the project, also called K-Rail, the survey will help identify the alignment very fast and start the construction. K-Rail is a joint venture by the state government and the railway ministry.

From Kasaragod to Tirur, the Silver Line will run parallel to the existing railway track. From Tirur to Thiruvananthapuram, the line will pass separately from the existing railway line since that stretch has a large number of curves that hamper speed.

It will have 10 stations and a proposal to build short-distance feeder links to connect to other stations too is also on the cards. Trains will have a maximum speed of 200 km/h. tnn

NEW DELHI: The city’s monumental waste management problem was recognised by both Supreme Court and parliamentary panels this year. There were few pluses and many missed goals for garbage management in 2019.

Among the gains was the initiation of dismantling Delhi’s three mountains of shame. A deadline of two years has been fixed for flattening the three landfills and setting up biodiversity parks in their place.

After decades of neglect and policy paralysis — which ended in Delhi’s landfill sites at Ghazipur, Bhalswa and Okhla approaching the height of Qutub Minar — trommelling and bio-remediation started to deconstruct the legacy garbage mix.

Taking suo motu cognisance of a TOI report in May, National Green Tribunal (NGT) dismissed the plans of the municipal corporations of capping the landfill sites and, instead, directed them to follow the “Indore model” in biomining for clearing up legacy waste. The report had mentioned how landfills were polluting underground aquifers and people living nearby were being forced to use water contaminated by leachate.

On NGT’s orders, the civic bodies pushed ahead with a Rs 250-crore biomining plan for 265 lakh tonnes of legacy waste to reduce the heights of the three landfills. About 20,000 metric tonnes of waste was segregated and neatly piled in rows at Bhalswa landfill near GT Karnal Road in the first two months. There is still the pressing question of where to dispose of the inert material, such as sand and mud.

A senior north corporation official overseeing the implementation of the plan said, “We will soon have 15 trommelling machines to sieve the garbage, but we are running out of space for storing inert soil. The abandoned pits in Bhatti Mines are the best option for it.”

The civic bodies have still failed to crack the source of Delhi’s waste problem — segregation of garbage at source. Despite issuing several notices in multiple colonies and giving a six-month deadline for developing nine model wards in the city, the plan has failed to catch up.

Experts from Centre for Science and Environment and NGOs have repeatedly underlined that with over 50% biodegradable waste there is a high potential to compost or generate biogas out of the segregated wet waste. An South Delhi Municipal Corporation official said a great amount of “political will” is required to enforce segregation of garbage at source. “We can’t issue challans due to backlash from councillors,” he added.

I work as an assistant at LIC, which means that I am not at home at all times. The garbage collector does not visit my locality at a fixed time too, so it makes a lot of sense for me to treat household waste myself.

I segregate tea leaves, green leafy vegetables, egg shells etc and put them all in a compost bin . I add waste decomposing agents and cocopit to the mix. Within a month, the wet waste transforms into great quality manure, usable for my garden at my home in Vishwakarma Nagar.

The dry waste generated from my household, like plastics, bottles, medicine bottles etc is given to the recycler.

I started this practice a year ago, when I realized that we are unnecessarily burdening our planet with so much waste generation . On top of that, I find the activity fun to do. When the nutrient-rich manure is ready, the proud feeling is indescribable. I have a beautiful tej patta (bay leaf) plant blooming in my garden, because of that manure.

We don’t put leftover food in the compost mix, as it is necessary to maintain its pH balance. Our house help is also instructed to dispose of waste properly. I tell her what to throw and where to throw it on a daily basis, and she willingly complies.

Waste segregation also helps the garbage collectors. They are humans too; if we do our bit, their work is significantly reduced as well.

I wish that everyone starts doing this at their household level. It is our responsibility to reduce waste generated from our homes, so that it helps in reducing the burden on our planet. The pollution levels are skyrocketing and climate change is real. It is high time that we realize our responsibility towards our planet, and encourage others to be responsible too.

82,['1/01/2020'],"TTD to offer one laddu free, save Rs 250 crore annually","This story is from January 1, 2020

Representative image

TIRUPATI: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), in what could be called a New Year gift, has decided to offer a free ‘ laddu ’ to all devotees who visit the sacred abode of Lord Venkateswara. The scheme is likely to be rolled out on the auspicious occasion of Vaikuntha Ekadashi, which falls on January 6.

Given religious sentiments attached by the devotees to the laddu prasadam, TTD produces and distributes three different kinds of laddus — big laddu, small laddu and prasadam laddu. Around 3,000 big laddus, weighing 700 grams each, are produced everyday, of which some are offered free to ticket-holders of certain Arjitha sevas, while the rest are sold for Rs 200 each to VIPs or those with recommendation letters. TTD incurs an expenditure of Rs 170 per big laddu.

The small laddu, weighing 175 grams each, is the most sought-after prasadam. About 3 lakh to 3.75 lakh such laddus are produced everyday, for which TTD incurs an expenditure of Rs 39 per laddu. TTD has been selling the small laddus, which is also known ‘Tirupati laddu’, under different categories and at different prices. Under the divya darshan system, it offers one free laddu, two laddus priced at Rs 10 each and any additional laddu (maximum two additional laddus per person) at Rs 25 each.

Sarva darshan devotees get two laddus at Rs 10 each and the additional ones at Rs 25 each. Similarly, special entry and VIP darshan ticket-holders get two laddus free and two additional ones at Rs 25 each. The small laddu is also sold for Rs 50 in the open counters.

The temple administration also prepares approximately 75,000 prasadam laddus weighing about 25 grams each which are offered free of cost inside the temple after devotees complete darshan.

Given the subsidies involved in the laddu sale process, TTD has been incurring an annual loss of around Rs 250 crore. The multiple categories in the sale process have also led to widespread black-marketing of the laddus. Taking these complexities into account and to reduce the losses due to subsidised sale of laddus, the temple administration has now decided to simplify the whole process and stop the multiple category system of laddu sale at differential prices.

So from January 6, one small laddu would be offered free of cost to every devotee who visits the temple. In addition, devotees can purchase any quantity of laddus they desire at Rs 50 each.

Of this, 248 were booked for helmetless riding and 312 for honking.The revelry on Park Street, which was abuzz with visitors at restaurants since afternoon, peaked after sunset. As the lights came on, thousands descended upon the party hub amid unprecedented security. At least 41 pickets were set up under 13 DCPs.The city, however, saw a few stray incidents. At Avishikta crossing, a young man allegedly assaulted a traffic sergeant from the Purba Jadavpur traffic guard on Monday evening when he was asked to stop his car for checking. Cops said that the man was under medication and appeared disoriented. He was admitted to MR Bangur Hospital and the Survey Park police registered a case against him. Patuli police arrested a man for snatching a woman’s bag that contained valuable documents.Traffic cops, too, were on their toes to stop extortion bids.

Allahabad: An elaborate surveillance and security system — involving 185 closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, seven night vision devices, three digitised lost-and-found camps, six wireless grids, 13 hi-tech fire stations and 12 fire watchtowers, among other things — promises to keep more than five crore devotees safe during Magh Mela 2020.

The 43-day annual fair will begin with Paush Purnima bathing ritual on January 10 and end with Mahashivratri dip on February 24.

Deputy IG (Allahabad range) KP Singh told TOI that the security blueprint also included deployment of over 3,500 police personnel, including 243 lady cops. “Compared to Magh Mela 2018, we are increasing police presence by 25% this time,” Singh said.

The fair will sprawl over 2,000 bigha and has been divided into three zones — Sangam, Jhunsi and Arail — and six sectors. Apart from 13 police stations and 38 outposts, a 5km-long deep-water barricading and 3km-long river line have been created for the safety and convenience of devotees who would be flocking from different parts of the country during the mega religious affair.

“For the first time in Magh Mela, we will be using night vision devices. As many as 185 CCTV cameras, including 14 pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) and 52 fixed ones, have already been installed on the premises for strict vigi,” the DIG said.

Apart from the police force, four bomb disposal squads, 10 anti-sabotage teams, 20 companies of paramilitary personnel and a team from the Integrated Command & Control Centre will help the Magh Mela authorities man the sea of pilgrims.

Police deployment will include three additional SPs, 15 deputy SPs, 30 inspectors, two teams of ATS commandos, two companies of RAF, 50 jal police personnel, 16 mounted cops and one company each of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF).

While deep-water barricading has been done along ghats to stop devotees from venturing into deeper waters, the river lines will allow deployment of boats. The DIG said jal police will press 20 motor boats into service.

An estimated 45 lakh devotees are expected to take the holy dip on Paush Purnima and another 15 lakh on Mahashivratri. Around 2.5 crore devotees are also expected to bathe in the river on Mauni Amavasya on January 24.

Charitha Reddy

HYDERABAD: When a young woman IT professional from Hyderabad, Charitha Reddy, was killed in a road accident in Michigan, US, on December 27, her family appealed for online donations of $ 50,000 to help transport her body back and support her family. Charitha’s family members have left for the US to bring her body back. Her parents live in Neredmet in Secunderabad .

The appeal touched a chord with many. Within a couple of days, as much as $ 1,07,779 (approx. Rs 77 lakh) was raised with 3,400 people making contributions. Such was the outpouring of generosity that Charitha’s cousin Jayanthi Reddy, who was organising online donations on a GoFundMe page, decided to stop accepting donations.

On the page, Jayanthi gave details of the accident and asked everyone to donate generously so that the money could help support the family.

Charitha (25), who had been in the US for over four years working for a multinational company, died on December 27 when an intoxicated man drove his vehicle into her parked car.

When the accident took place, Charitha was sitting in the rear and was badly injured. She later died. Her parents said another girl, who was in the car, was operated for an injury on her jaw, but is believed to be out of danger.

In her appeal, Jayanthi had said, “The Muskegon Heights man who hit our car was intoxicated and it was the sole reason for this incident and we request you to be sober while driving.”

Every year, thousands of people gather at India Gate on the last day of the year to mark a new beginning.

NEW DELHI: Every year, thousands of people gather at India Gate on the last day of the year to mark a new beginning. They reach the iconic heritage site from all directions. This year, however, the same will not be possible, since designated entry points have “compromised” its openness.

The barricading around India Gate is testimony to the shrinking of public places, which defined Delhi in 2019. With boundary walls around the National War Memorial , tourists no longer get the uninhibited view of the heritage buildings associated with the capital — the Parliament and Secretariat . Experts have also raised concerns regarding the redevelopment of the area around Central Vista.

“India Gate’s open aspect allowed those arriving or passing by to connect to the larger city, and symbolically, to the country and all its people,” said Sujata Kohli, honorary president of Indian Society of Landscape Architects (ISOLA).

The year also opened up new spaces for public gatherings, with Sunder Nursery and Central Park proving major crowd pullers for people planning to spend their day outside. Central Park in Connaught Place has seen several public gatherings over the last few months, with recent one being when hundreds of people turning up at the site to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

Sunder Nursery, which is flanked by Humayun’s Tomb in the south and Purana Qila in the north, also became a viable “alternative” for family gatherings. The entry, however, unlike India Gate, is ticketed.

Visitors can now also opt for a “heritage walk” through the lush garden between 10am and 4pm, according to the management at Sunder Nursery.

Another site that reappeared in the public imagination late in 2019 was Jantar Mantar, which had been “restricted” for public gatherings early in the year. But the monument made a comeback, becoming the centre for rallies and protests.

Thiruvananthapuram: As many as 225 tourism accommodation units in the state will become ‘ plastic free ’ from Wednesday as part of the ‘ Clean Kerala Initiative ’ project of Responsible Tourism Mission under the state tourism department. It is being implemented in association with Kerala Travel Mart (KTM) Society.

These accommodation units, including resorts, hotels, homestays and house boats have decided to exclude 19 plastic items like carry bags, tray, disposable cups, bottles, straw, plates, cups, cling film, thermocol, bowls, flags, sheets used for food parcelling, spoons, fruit and vegetable punnets, juice packets, PVC flex materials and food parcelling plastic containers, said an offical release issued here on Tuesday.

These accommodation units, including 30 resorts, 35 homestays, 30 house boats and 130 hotels across the state, have already handed over the self-declaration form to RT Mission.

All hotels, resorts and homestays and 20 house boats in Kumarakom have joined hands with RT Mission in this venture. Joining the initiative are 40 units in Kottayam, 15 in Ernakulam, 20 in Kasaragod, 32 in Idukki, 38 in Wayanad, 32 in Kozhikode, 15 in Alappuzha, five in Thrissur, 10 in Kollam, 12 in Thiruvananthapuram and six in Malappuram.

As part of the ‘Clean Kerala Initiative’ the RT Mission had organized a two-day workshop for tourism industry partners. The decision to make the tourism destinations of state as plastic-free and green certified was taken in the workshop.

Tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran said the aim was to make nine select destinations 100% plastic-free through the project. Kumarakom could be declared as the first plastic free destination of Kerala in 2020 itself, said tourism secretary Rani George.

According to tourism director P Bala Kiran, Kerala Tourism has already started RT classification for tourism enterprises for achieving the plastic-free goal.

Rupeshkumar K, the state RT Mission coordinator, said that to promote the alternative products for plastic bags, the mission was distributing 70,000 cloth bags to various tourism enterprises as a token and that many tourism enterprises have signed agreement with different units of RT Mission which produces various eco-friendly products.

“Altogether, 3,000 rooms in 225 accommodation units became plastic-free as part of this initiative. The project aims to make nine major tourism destinations in Kerala plastic-free by 2021,” he added.

88,['1/01/2020'],"Dubious distinction: MP, Maha top the country in tiger deaths","This story is from January 1, 2020

Nagpur: The country lost 110 tigers in the year just gone by. The year also saw death of 491 leopards, according to figures compiled by Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI). While poaching was big reason behind tiger mortality, road and rail accidents accounted for a big chunk of leopard deaths.

In case of tigers, there is a marginal rise in numbers compared to 2018 when 104 tiger deaths were recorded including 34 due to poaching. In 2019 too, 38 of the 110 deaths have been attributed to poaching. Like last year, Madhya Pradesh continues to lead the tally with 29 tiger deaths followed by Maharashtra with 22. In 2018 MP saw deaths of 23 tigers followed by 19 in Maharashtra.

However, the official database of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) differs with the figures. NTCA has recorded 92 tiger deaths in 2019 while it was 102 in 2018. Tito Joseph, programme coordinator of WPSI, which works for wildlife crime enforcement, says poaching and seizure of body parts of tigers had slightly increased since last year.

The difference in NTCA data may be due non-inclusion of figures derived from seizure of body parts. “We calculated the number of tigers depending on seizures, which may not necessarily belong to one individual only,” Joseph said.

For example, in Maharashtra the official figures record deaths of 18 tigers but it doesn’t include three tigers poached in Tumsar range under Bhandara division in July this year. The arrested accused have confessed they killed three tigers there. This may be the case elsewhere.

“There are certain corrections which will be communicated to the headquarters after verification from divisions concerned. Some mortalities were not communicated by the states to the NTCA,” NTCA officials said. “As far as Tumsar tigers were concerned, the number has been split in MP and Maharashtra as some body parts were seized in MP,” they said.

As per the latest tiger estimation by NTCA-WII, there are 2,967 tigers in India. In Maharashtra, the number increased from 190 in 2014 to 312 in 2018. With 526 tigers, MP is at the top. Deaths due to poaching remain a cause of concern in both states.

Of the 110 deaths in 2019, 38 were attributed to body parts seizure and poaching, 26 were found dead, 36 died in fight with other individuals, three due to road/rail accidents and six during rescue.

“On the one hand, it shows good detection rate and higher enforcement activity but on the other also shows increasing demand for tiger body parts. Improving intelligence-led enforcement, addressing impact of linear intrusions and conflict management can help keep viable populations of tigers,” Joseph said.

This year saw a marginal drop in number of leopard deaths. Though NTCA doesn’t have a database on leopard deaths, WPSI data shows in 2018, 500 leopards had died country-wide which included 169 due to poaching. There was no let-up in poaching of leopards in 2019 too as 127 of 491 deaths were attributed to this reason.

Maharashtra this year accounted for 97 leopard deaths. As many as 31 of these were in road and rail accidents. Last year, state saw 93 leopards dying including 22 in road and rail accidents.

“No general inference can be drawn from these figures. Every landscape has its own set of pressures and problems, but leopards are really getting hammered in road/rail accidents, which is worrisome. It is the result of not just increasing traffic volume but also increased speed due to four-laning and widening of roads,” said Nitin Desai, WPSI’s Central India director.

Park Street restaurants stayed packed throughout the day, while visitors had to wait for at least 45 minutes t... Read More

KOLKATA: Crooning bars in central Kolkata will remain open beyond January 1 midnight. Following a rise in footfalls in the last week of 2019, most bars with live band have taken permission to stay open till 1am, while a few have taken the licence to serve drinks and play music till 2am.

Bands at these bars usually start wrapping up by 10.30pm. But enthused by the sudden rise in patrons since Christmas Eve, the bars applied for permission to remain open till 1am and 2am on December 31 and January 1. Bars, like Rocks on Waterloo Street and Bower on Mission Row, stuck notices outside their establishments, informing their guests about the new hours.

The late deadline also meant police would have to be more vigilant in the Esplanade-Chandni Chowk-Mission Row stretch, where most of the singing bars were located, given the history of skirmishes from there. “After a good run from December 24 and 31, we are expecting decent business on January 1 as well,” said a bar owner in Chandni Chowk. “ Getting permission for an extra hour or more involves a fee of Rs 15,000, and we also have to make budget for other overheads. So, only if a bar owner is kind of sure of getting good business will he apply for the permission to operate till late.”

Business at many of these bars in central Kolkata, located within a few meters of each other, witnessed a dip in earnings for most part of 2019 after police barred patrons from showering money on singers and conducted raids on some of the establishments for violating norms, which stipulated that the crooners could only sing and sway to the music but not break into a dance. Many bars with multiple floors were forced to shut owing to low footfalls as band leaders, who took the place on lease from owners and arrange singers and musicians, could no longer afford to pay.

A little away on Park Street, the party street of the city, revellers started visiting since 31st morning. All the restaurants had long queues outside and the average time of waiting touched 45 minutes during lunch hours. As the day progressed, the crowd swelled, turning the street into a sea of people. For restaurants, the crowds meant the till would not stop ringing. Mocambo and Peter Cat, which have seen a 20% surge in footfalls since Christmas Eve, decided to stay open till 1am on January 1 and 4. The original plan was to have a late deadline only on December 31. “The huge crowds encouraged us to seek a late closure on New Year’s Day and the first Saturday of the year. Going by the trend since Christmas, there will be a spill over of crowds to the New Year. Kolkatans have gone into celebratory mood,” said Siddharth Kothari of Mocambo and Peter Cat.

92,['1/01/2020'],Will unsolved cases return to haunt pol parties this year?,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Vijayawada: From YS Vivekananda Reddy’s murder to data theft scandal, Andhra Pradesh witnessed at least three cases, which resulted in huge political battles, in 2019. With these cases remaining unsolved , political analysts feel that the issues could come back to haunt political parties later.

The first major political battle ensued after YS Vivekananda Reddy, a former MP and paternal uncle of the then opposition leader YS Jaganmohan Reddy was found murdered on April 15. The incident turned into one of the main election issues a special investigative team (SIT) was formed to probe the case.

Eventually, three persons, including Vivekananda’s personal assistant MV Krishna Reddy and two other associates — Yerram Gangi Reddy and Prakash, were arrested for allegedly tampering with the evidence. Not long after Srinivasa Reddy, a close relative of one of the prime suspects Parameshwara Reddy, was found dead. He had purportedly committed suicide.

The incident triggered a huge uproar in the state, which was witnessing intense political battles. While Jagan demanded that the case be transferred to CBI when he was in the opposition, he decided to continue with the SIT after becoming the chief minister. Recently on December 4, former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu sought CBI intervention.

The second major political battle broke out, also during the election campaigning, when a whistle-blower claimed that the Andhra Pradesh government had allegedly leaked public data to a private firm called IT Grids. The Telangana state police raided the company as it was based in Hyderabad and found that the company had illegal access to voters’ Aadhaar, phone numbers, ration cards and other sensitive data. A tripartite political slugfest ensued as both ruling governments of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh blamed each other while Jagan criticised Naidu for the security breach. Till date, the case remains unsolved.

A controversy over deletion of voters’ names happened during the same time that was the third unsolved mystery. Several online applications were made for deletion of voters’ names through Form 7 that led to a war of words between the YSRC and TDP. Around eight lakh forms were examined and the EC found a little over 5,000 of them to be genuine. However, YSRC claimed to have helped people file around 7 lakh forms themselves.

Nagpur: Prevalence of kidney disorders has increased number of patients on dialysis in recent years. Those who undergo dialysis must forsake many delicacies that used to be a part of their diet earlier. But, a new concept of low-salt or no-salt snacks can bring this taste back in their lives.

Senior nephrologist and patron of Central India Nephrology Society, Dr Dhananjay Ookalkar, and his team have modified the recipes of some popular snacks like dhokla, fried rice, and appam and made them suitable for patients of kidney disorders and hypertension. They have used substitutes for salt and added protein-rich ingredients into these dishes.

“Dialysis has increased a lifespan of kidney patients but they face several issues regarding quality of life. Low salt or no salt food is rarely available in markets. Packaged foods also have hidden sodium contents. So, we decided to make our own low-salt options,” said Dr Ookalkar.

Those under dialysis or who have a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are strongly advised to avoid any food that contains over 250 mg of salt. All four dishes made in this project have only 100 mg of salt. Dialysis patients require more proteins than normal people. For this, protein-rich ingredients are added in the recipes.

Dr Ookalkar said that he wishes to popularize these snacks so that patients having kidney and hypertension can prepare them at homes. In the next phase, they will be adding many other breakfast items, especially for hypertension patients.

The dishes include rava appam, in which traditional appams are made using of rava, curd, crushed paneer and 1gm of salt with fresh vegetables. Dhokla made of crushed poha is another dish. Raw poha is grinded with curd to make dhokla plum. To make fried rice, 100gm raw rice is fried with different vegetables. The use of salt substitutes such as lemon juice, tomatoes, onions ensure taste even if salt content is low.

Dietitian Shraddha Rahate, who makes these food items, said that patients are loving them. “We have started serving these snacks to patients who are on dialysis. They find it refreshing,” she said. “Those who are on dialysis from more than three years start finding it difficult to follow strict diet restrictions. These tasty but healthy options are like boon for them. Apart from them, patients of hypertension can also have these to avoid further complications,” she added.

94,['1/01/2020'],11 booked for forging document of Pondy grove where Bharathiyar had stayed,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Representative image

PUDUCHERRY: The CB-CID registered a case against 11 people, including the chairperson of Puducherry women’s commission and a tahsildar from Tamil Nadu, on charges of forging the document of a grove in Puducherry, where Tamil poet Bharathiyar stayed for about 10 years. They also received Rs 2.73 crore from the government when it acquired a portion of the land.

The grove, known as ‘ Kuyil Thoppu ’, is where the poet penned most of his poems during his stay in Puducherry. A case has been registered against retired public servant V C Gobinath, Puducherry women’s commission chairperson Rani Rajan Babu, her sons Ashok Thuyavan and Balaji Raja, TN tahsildar R Banumathy, P Gayathri Devi, R Prabath, S Rajalaskmi, S Rajasekaran, S Saraswathy and S Magudeswaran. All the accused, who had received shares of the compensation given by the government, are related to each other, police said.

The agency booked them under sections 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy), 193 (punishment for giving false evidence in a judicial proceeding), 209 (dishonestly making false claim in court), 210 (fraudulently obtaining decree for sum not due) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian penal code.

The agency’s action came after a directive from Puducherry chief judicial magistrate on Monday. As per the complaint, the 11 people forged the documents of 4.34-hectare of land belonging to P Aravamudhu and two others represented by their power agent V Seenuvasamoorthy Reddiar and received a compensation of Rs 2.73 crore from the government after the government acquired 2.5 hectares of land.

The government acquired 1.46 hectare for constructing a memorial for late Congress stalwart Kamaraj, 0.61 hectare for expansion of the East Coast Road and 0.43 hectare for construction of interstate police wireless quarters.

The accused made a fake certificate dated January 30, 1935, claiming that the land was sold to them. They made a false claim for compensation based on the forged sale certificate before the court and received the compensation without the knowledge of the complainants.

The complainants, who came to know about the settlement, claimed there was no record with the government on the sale of the property. They lodged a complaint with the SP (CBCID), urging the agency to initiate action against the accused in September 2019. However, the agency, which initially began the investigation, did not proceed further and register a case.

The complainants then filed a petition before the Puducherry chief judicial magistrate, pleading for a direction to the agency to file a case, investigate into the matter and file a final report following which the agency filed a case against the accused on Monday.

Bharathiyar penned most of his poems including Kuyil Pattu at ‘Kuyil Thoppu’ in Puducherry after he sought asylum in the French territory to evade arrest from the British between 1908 and 1918. The Puducherry government, which earlier proposed to establish a memorial for Bharathiyar in the site, has failed to initiate any concrete efforts to implement the project.

Vijayawada: The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation ( VMC ) made significant progress on the solid-waste management front in 2019 by harnessing technological advancements.

The civic body introduced online waste management system allowing sanitation workers to use QR code scanners while collecting garbage bins from houses that could be, in turn, monitored in real time through the commissioner’s dashboard. Following the change, as many as 32 wards out of 59 have been declared as bin free. VMC also installed 45 smart bins at various locations that sends alerts to authorities as soon as they are full.

Besides, the VMC also established a composting plant with a capacity of 150 metric tonnes to process solid waste. The Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste plant has also become functional in 2019 that can process 200 metric tonnes of construction rubble every day.

The VMC has identified 43 locations for the construction of additional toilets under the Street Furniture Project to address the problem of open defecation and urination. The civic body won an award from Swacch Andhra Corporation for best toilet maintenance.

Apart from domestic garbage collection, the VMC has taken up another initiative to address the problem of bulk waste. The civic body empanelled an agency to collect and process bulk waste from hotels, restaurants and other commercial establishments. As many as 285 bulk waste generators have been identified in the city, said VMC commissioner Prasanna Vekatesh.

Meanwhile, the plastic-free drive taken up by the VMC gained momentum in the year. Apart from single-use plastic being banned, the civic body also initiated various measures to promote alternatives to plastic. Prasanna Venkatesh said the distribution of cloth, jute and paper bags have been yielding positive results. He observed that earlier three tonnes of plastic used to be generated in the city every day that has now come down to less than two tonnes. The VMC also signed an MoU with UltraTech cement to recycle the plastic.

On the administrative front, the VMC set up a social media complaint cell to address any civic issue within 24 hours. The commissioner said the initiative has got a huge response from citizens and it has redressed more than 90% of the complaints within stipulated time.

“For employees of VMC, the year 2019 will remain a memorable one as they started getting salaries through the 010 account on the first day of every month. Although there are issues that are yet to be resolved we are constantly working to resolve them,” said Prasanna Vekatesh.

Bareilly: Damaged city roads and reduced visibility due to dense fog have been exposing commuters’ lives to danger, whereas fund-starved Public Works Department (PWD) officials say they feel helpless as repeated demands for funds for the repairing of the roads went unheard.

Commuting on damaged Choupla road, Pilibhit road, Police Lines road, Quila overbridge, Bisalpur road, among others, has become life-threatening. Besides, the condition of several roads connecting prominent city areas such as Mini Bypass-Quila road, Choupla, city station, Police Lines, Pilibhit road, etc, has deteriorated further in the absence of proper maintenance.

According to PWD officials, the department is fund-starved and does not have money to repair the roads on its own. “We have been waiting for the government to release the fund sought by us for the repair and the maintenance of the roads.”

Speaking to TOI, PWD, Bareilly division, executive engineer Harbansh Singh said, “We have been sending detailed reports on the condition of city roads that need repairing repeatedly. Besides the reports, videos and photos of the damaged city roads, including Sitapur road, Bisalpur road, Pilibhit road, Mini Bypass-Quila overbridge, etc, were also sent to the state government for the approval of funds to the tunes of Rs120 crore for their re[air and maintenance. Since we have not received the money yet, the condition of the roads remains unchanged.”

Daily commuter Saurabh Singh, a resident of Green Park locality, said, “Commuting is risky with flyover constructions underway at Choupla, Satellite and near Lal Phatak. The roads have been damaged due to the installation of heavy machines for the construction work. Since motorists have been using service lanes, the authorities must repair them for their convenience and ease off traffic congestions. It is very unsafe to travel in the evening as potholes become invisible due to heavy fog.”

PWD officials said they would repair the roads as soon as they receive the fund.

Meanwhile, traffic inspector JN Asthana told TOI, “With flyover construction underway in three prominent areas, it has become difficult to maintain smooth traffic movement, especially during peak hours. It is the duty of the department taking up the construction/repair work install signage boards cautioning commuters of the apparent danger at the construction sites. Besides, barricading should be done and field workers in reflective uniforms should be deputed to alert commuters near the construction sites.”

Panaji: The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) has opposed the auctioning of mining leases and demanded that the government form a state-owned Goa Minerals Development Corporation.

“All the mining workers who have lost jobs due to mining closure should be re-employed in the corporation with continuity of service. Pending formation of this corporation, all thosewho lost jobs must be paid a sum of Rs 25,000 per month as ‘retention allowance’,” general secretary Christopher Fonseca told reporters.

All trucks, barges, earth moving machineries, mining equipment and infrastructure must be systematically pooled and used to operate the mining leases under the corporation, Fonseca said, adding that it should be managed by a board of directors.

“The second complete closure of mining operations has devastated Goa’s economy. Tens of thousands of workers and mining dependants have lost their jobs and without any tangible source of income, are presently facing extreme hardships,” he said.

AITUC has also demanded 7th pay benefits to panchayat employees, KTC transportation to and from all the industrial estates, settling of overtime wages of river navigation department employees for the last 24 months, issues of KTC badli drivers and conductors, pending issues of panchayat employees, lifeguards and BSNL contract workers.

AITUC also demanded that unskilled workers be paid a minimum of Rs 700 per day, semi-skilled Rs 770 per day, skilled Rs 847 and highly skilled Rs 932.

99,['1/01/2020'],CCP to finalise contractor for pay-parking soon,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Panaji: The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) is in the process of finalising the pay-parking contractor for the city. The highest of the two bidders has quoted Rs 57 lakhs per annum.

“The bids are currently under scrutiny,” an official from the civic body said.

The pay-parking scheme is being implemented on nine stretches in Panaji around-the-clock. CCP decided to have pay-parking for 24 hours, including Sundays and public holidays, instead of 12 hours as was earlier decided. This is because of the high volume of offshore casino vehicles that occupy and block parking spaces. Parking fee on two-wheelers will be also be imposed by CCP.

“The contractor will be responsible for marking the -parking slots and affixing boards. They will also use hand-held electronic ticketing machines to issue tickets,” the CCP official said.

“CCP will insist on a 50% bank guarantee so that the corporation is not at a loss should the contractor default on payments,” the official added.

Till now, a number of meetings have been convened between offshore casinos, the tourism department and traffic police to sort out traffic congestion and haphazard parking of casino vehicles. When asked about the assurance of vehicles being parked at the multi-storied parking complex at Patto, mayor Uday Madkaikar said the issue will be taken up right after pay-parking is implemented.

He also said that there are around 300 two-wheelers belonging to casino employees that are parked in the vicinity each day.

The bid for the tender had to be kept open for an additional 10 days after CCP received just one bidder.

In 2017, the corporation burnt its fingers when the company chosen for the pay-parking system failed to pay CCP Rs 24 crore, this even while it continued to collect parking fees from motorists. The system’s attempt to bring about traffic-discipline also ran aground.

According to the last contract, the contractor was required to pay CCP Rs 63 lakh per year and in turn, collect parking fees for two-wheelers and four-wheelers in the city’s core zone. The contractor was required to depute 60 workers to collect parking fees but it failed to do that, as well.

100,['1/01/2020'],Gorewada daily wagers oppose contract system,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Nagpur: Over 50-60 temporary forest labourers working at Gorewada Rescue Centre in the city have expressed dissent over bringing them under the authority of a private contractor who will take over from Wednesday.

Last month, leading service provider BVG India Limited bagged the contract to manage the workers who operate as daily wagers for works like chowkidars, firefighting, cleaning, animal care and feeding among host of other outdoor services.

Till now, these daily wagers were recruited by Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) for three months and after a break of one month were taken back again. The same process is being followed for the last 5-6 years.

Through tendering process recently, the FDCM handed over their services to BVG group. Being experienced, all the labourers have been recruited on contract by the BVG.

The labourers were told by RS Kanojia, secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Kamgar Mahasangh (BJKM), not to join the contractor “as their services can be terminated any time for non-performance”.

Kanojia, in a press release, said, “The union is opposed to a private party as it will deprive workers of their basic rights, seniority, government benefits, health scheme, and leaves etc.”

FDCM officials argued that the new contract system is in interest of the workers. “They will be paid Rs9,200 instead of Rs8,200 earlier. As it is being daily wagers, they had no government benefits. Now they will be paid continuously for 11 months, the period of contract,” they said.

The officials said most of the workers have agreed to go on contract and have also submitted their documents to BVG. “However, a section of them are being misguided by the union leaders,” the FDCM officials said.

On Tuesday, the FDCM officials held talks with the workers to resolve the issue. However, the labourers said Kanojia would meet FDCM officials on Wednesday after which a final decision will be taken.

They said importance must be given to making students understand the subject.“In these special classes, schools are only concentrating on teaching how to score pass marks.

HYDERABAD: Starting January 2, 2020, class 10 students preparing for the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination in the city will be served biscuits or bananas as snacks instead of sprouts and tamarind rice.

The education department officials are planning to provide these items along with mid-day meals as the students have to be in schools from 8.30am to 5.30pm. “They will either get banana or biscuits. If more funds are allocated, chikki will also be provided,” said B Venkata Narasamma, district education officer, Hyderabad. She said that the money for providing snacks will come from the collector’s fund and donors. “If any donor approaches a school and wants to fund snacks for children, we will allow it as students will get more food,” she added, and said that they have been providing snacks for class 10 students for the past two years.

The officials said that they have decided to do away with sprouts and tamarind rice as many schools in the district have no kitchen facility. They said that it was becoming difficult to cook these items and serve to students on time.

The said items will reach the schools in the morning so that teachers and principals can choose a time and distribute it to students as per convenience.

Parents and activists welcomed the move.

Thiruvananthapuram: The special session of the assembly, which was convened to pass a resolution against CAA, did not take up the obituary reference of Thomas Chandy who died on December 20.

The usual practice in the assembly is that when the session is convened obituary references of the MLAs or former MLAs who have died after the last session are taken up on the first day and the house adjourns for the day as a mark of respect. But, on Tuesday, when the special session was convened there was no obituary reference for Thomas Chandy who was a three-time MLA of the House and a former minister.

On Tuesday, Congress MLA K S Sabarinadhan registered his protest for not paying tributes to the senior MLA through a letter to the speaker. However, P Sreeramakrishnan told the House that the obituary reference was not taken up since it was a special one-day session convened for passing a crucial resolution, and would be taken up in the next session.

“It was most unfortunate that the House went into the official proceedings without any reference to the death of Thomas Chandy. This has not been the practice of the House,” Sabarinadhan said.

During the 14th state assembly, the House has lost four MLAs including Thomas Chandy. K K Ramachandran Nair who represented Chengannur constituency died in January 2018. P B Abdul Razaak who represented Manjeswaram constituency died in October 2018 and former finance minister K M Mani died in April 2019.

Jhansi: A video that went viral in Mahoba on Monday shows the ARTO and his associates badly thrashing an elderly auto-rickshaw driver. The video also shows a cop intervening and trying to save the driver. By late night, both the parties lodged cases against each other.

As per reports, auto driver Rakesh Yadav was waiting near Bajariya police station in search of passengers when ARTO Mahoba, Ajay Yadav, along with his team arrived there and challaned Rakesh to which he objected. The discussion turned into a heated argument and some men in khaki accompanying the ARTO started thrashing the driver, who was also seen hurling abuses.

The entire scenario was filmed by some passerby on mobile who later made it viral. Hearing the news, a number of auto drivers reached the police station and started agitating against the ARTO, alleging him of extorting money and demanded action.

Late night both sides lodged cases against each other. An FIR was lodged against the ARTO, his driver and two constables under sections 323, 504, 427 of IPC and against the auto driver under sections 323, 504 IPC.

HYDERABAD: The Telangana Congress has decided to approach the high court against the state election commission and TRS government for announcing the municipal poll schedule without finalising the reservation of wards for SCs, STs, BCs and women.

While making it clear that the party is not against the municipal polls, the Congress alleged that the delay in finalising quota for urban local body polls was a conspiracy by the TRS.

“Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao does not want to give time to the opposition parties to finalise candidates to contest municipal elections. If reservation of 120 municipal chairpersons and 10 municipal corporation mayors is announced on January 4 or 5, followed by the reservation of 50% of the total 4,000 wards that go to the polls in urban local bodies, we would have to finalise the candidates and complete other formalities of issuing the B-forms in 24 to 48 hours as the nomination process begins on January 8,” Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president and Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy told TOI.

On the other hand, the Congress has adopted ‘select and elect’ policy for finalisation of candidates.

The party leadership has decided to leave it to the local cadre to select candidates and take responsibility to ensure that they are elected by working for their victory in the urban local bodies which goes to polls on January 22 as per the schedule announced by the state election commission.

Amitabh Chaturvedi (File photo)

HYDERABAD: Scam-hit Karvy Group on Tuesday said it has kicked off a restructuring exercise and has also initiated a major management reshuffle as part of efforts to improve overall governance and functioning.

The Hyderabad headquartered group said it is in the process of restructuring its overall business into two verticals — financial services and non-financial services — and has brought on board Amitabh Chaturvedi as Group CEO of its financial services business.

The rejig comes a little over a month after stock market regulator Sebi banned Karvy Group flagship Karvy Stock Broking Ltd (KSBL) for pledging securities of its clients, without their knowledge, to raise funds from banks and financial institutions in violation of the new Sebi rules that kicked in on October 1, 2019.

KSBL had pledged securities of around 95,000 clients to raise over Rs 2300 crore from various banks and financial institutions including ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Aditya Birla Finance, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, among others.

Sebi had, vide its circular dated June 20, 2019, asked all brokers to segregate clients’ funds and securities by September 30 in compliance with its order but KSBL failed to comply with the new norms.

Karvy Group chairman C Parthasarathy said in a statement on Tuesday that Chaturvedi has been appointed Group CEO of financial services with a mandate to completely overhaul the governance processes, ensure best practices and bring in greater fiduciary discipline to these businesses.

Chaturvedi, who has over 30 years of experience in the financial services space, has earlier been associated with organisations such as Dhanalakshmi Bank, Reliance AMC, ICICI and Essel Group.

The restructuring will see stock broking, wealth management, commodities trading and investment banking, among others, come under the ambit of financial services. On the other hand, non-financial services will comprise of data management services, data analytics, market research and allied businesses.

Karvy Group, which was set up in 1982, said changes in senior management are also being initiated and an experienced team would assist Chaturvedi in implementing the group's vision of having a strong presence in the financial services space.

113,['1/01/2020'],Net metering to continue for solar rooftop consumers,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Nagpur: In a major jolt to state discom MSEDCL, Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has rejected its demand of making net billing compulsory for solar rooftop consumers.

According to the MERC (Grid Interactive Rooftop Renewable Energy Generating Systems Regulations) 2019, it is up to the consumer to decide whether he wants net metering or net billing.

The net billing system proposed by MSEDCL would have made solar rooftop unviable and had been opposed by all consumers including Maharashtra Solar Manufacturers Association (MASMA).

Some aspects of the new regulations are in favour of MSEDCL. The cost of net meter and renewable energy meter used to be borne by the discom so far. Now, it will be borne by the consumer. However, the reality is that MSEDCL had not supplied even a single net meter to consumers so far. The consumers had purchased the meter on their own and MSEDCL had not refunded the cost to any consumer. Therefore, this change won’t affect the consumers much in real terms.

Secondly, MERC has decided to levy a grid support charge on consumers having load of more than 10 KW. While the formula for calculating this charge is mentioned in the notification, MSEDCL will have to seek its levy in the next tariff petition. The charge will be known after MERC gives a ruling on MSEDCL’s petition.

There are many clauses that are in favour of the consumers. The maximum solar load permissible on a MSEDCL distribution transformer was up to 40% of the transformer capacity. Now it has been increased to 70% with a deviation of 5% on either side. MSEDCL can permit 100% after conducting a load study.

MSEDCL has been given a timeline for processing the applications of solar consumers. It will have to issue a letter of sanction within 15 days of receiving the application. The testing of net meter and its installation has to be done within next 10 days. Grid synchronization and signing of agreement will have to be accomplished in another ten days. The registration fee has been reduced for smaller consumers. Earlier, it was Rs500 up to 5kW and Rs1,000 thereafter. Now, it is Rs500 up to 20kW and Rs100 for every 20kW or part of. High tension (HT) consumers will have to pay Rs5,000 flat.

Other clauses of the regulations are: All meters to have advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) facility with RS485 for higher communication port and check meter for solar generation is compulsory above 20kW and it is to be installed by MSEDCL.

Hyderabad: ICICI Bank on Tuesday said it is in the process of challenging the Telangana High Court order staying the Debt Recovery Tribunal-II Hyderabad order of December 9, 2019, in a plea that it had filed against Karvy Stock Broking Ltd (KSBL) and others.

ICICI Bank, which lent over Rs 625 crore to Karvy, said the tribunal had ordered Karvy to deposit sufficient security for its dues within 15 days, failing which its properties would be attached and had restrained Karvy from transferring, encumbering or creating any third party interest on the pledged properties. The bank also said the tribunal had ordered the appointment of Advocate Commissioner to take possession of all the properties and served notices on the defendants with regard to the travel restraint and asset disclosure that it had sought against Karvy and all the defendants.

The high court had, in its order dated December 24, 2019, said: “Prima facie the order dated 9-12-2019 in IA No 5811 of 2019 in OA No 833 of 2019 of the 1st respondent being an ex parte order is prejudicial to the petitioner. Therefore, there shall be interim suspension as prayed for.”

ICICI Bank, however, said the high court has neither stayed the DRT proceedings as a whole, nor stayed the tribunal’s orders in entirety and has only stayed the operation of the Advocate Commissioner. “The DRT orders requiring the defendants to deposit sufficient security and imposing a non-disposal injunction on the properties have been upheld by the high court and continue to be binding on the defendants. ICICI Bank is in the process of challenging the high court’s order in relation to the appointment of the Advocate Commissioner,” ICICI Bank said in a release. TNN

116,['1/01/2020'],President Ram Nath Kovind's wish to visit Sabarimala sends officials in a tizzy,"This story is from January 1, 2020

President Ram Nath Kovind

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: President Ram Nath Kovind has expressed interest for a darshan at Sabarimala when he reaches Kochi on Sunday. The office of the Rashtrapathi Bhavan has enquired about the facilities including chopper services available to reach Sabarimala.

“The government has asked the Travancore Devaswom Board whether it can arrange a helipad at Sannidhanam. There is no possibility for setting up a new helipad now. But we have communicated that there is a huge water tank which can be converted into a helipad at Pandithavalam,” said N Vasu, president of Travancore Devaswom Board.

However, he was not sure whether the Rashtrapathi Bhavan will be satisfied with this proposal. “The President’s security team will have to give the clearance first. It is not possible to set up an alternative helipad. We will have to first get the forest department’s clearance for it and that has many formalities,” said Vasu.

A senior police official said that the President is visiting Kochi on Sunday en route to Lakshadweep. “It will not be possible for the President to trek the hill shrine due to security reasons. Hence we have not received any confirmation whether he will be visiting the Sabarimala,” said the police official.

The state government has communicated about the facilities it can provide at Sabarimala to the Rashtrapathi Bhavan. “We are yet to get an official confirmation of his darshan at Sabarimala,” said an official from the devaswom minister’s office.

117,['1/01/2020'],Ambil Odha restoration work likely to start in a month,"This story is from January 1, 2020

TIMES VIEW

The restoration of Ambil Odha should not be confined to removal of silt, garbage and debris, installing iron mesh and building a retaining wall. The main reason for its flooding last year was numerous encroachments along it. Slums, shops and even cowsheds have come up along its banks. They obstructed and shrunk the waterway, causing the flooding. A firm stand about removing these encroachments is an absolute must if we want to prevent a repeat of September 25, 2019.

====

Pune: The civic body is likely to start the Ambil Odha redevelopment project in a month from four locations near Pune-Satara road.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has issued 16 tenders for different works, including removal of silt and debris from the nullah. Each tender involves works amounting to about Rs22 lakh.

Susmita Shirke, the head of the PMC’s drainage department, said, “The tender process will be completed in a month, after which the ground work will start. This is the beginning of the restoration project in the flood-affected areas.”

The PMC decided to repair and restore Ambil Odha after the September 25 deluge that claimed many lives. The restoration and repair works aim to improve its water carrying capacity and enhance the safety of residents living along the nullah. The project cost is estimated to be Rs300 crore. According to the PMC officials, different works would be carried out across the city with the help of local ward offices.

Shirke said iron mesh would be fitted on the borders of the bridges across the nullah to prevent citizens from throwing garbage in it.

According to the PMC’s plan, the project includes construction of a 5km retaining wall along the nullah. Residential areas adjacent to the nullah would be protected by it.

Heavy showers had inundated Tangewala society near Aranyeshwar during the September 25 deluge. The parking areas of Treasure Park society were flooded, damaging over 600 vehicles. The residents of Gururaj society, too, had suffered damage. Areas dotting Sinhagad and Satara Road, Sahakarnagar, Bibvewadi, Ambegaon, Katraj and Kondhwa were also affected by the deluge. A cleanliness drive would be carried out in all these areas.

A group of citizens had inspected the areas affected by the deluge and had given their suggestions for the nullah restoration work.

Thiruvananthapuram: The assembly on Tuesday passed a resolution requesting the central government to take immediate action to ensure a continued nominated representation of Anglo-Indians in the Lok Sabha and the state assemblies, which expires on January 26.

After unanimously ratifying the amendment bill for extending reservation for SC/ST communities in Parliament and state assemblies for another 10 years through a statutory resolution, the government resolution moved by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan urged the Centre to initiate measures to introduce a similar amendment bill to protect the rights of Anglo-Indian community.

Taking part in the discussion, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said this amounted to an open attack against minorities and asked the Centre to rectify its mistake. “The Union law minister said in Parliament that there were only 296 Anglo-Indians in the country, while their actual population is around 3.47 lakh,” he pointed out.

Meanwhile, presenting the resolution to ratify the amendment bill for extending SC/ST representation till January 26, 2030, the CM said the reservation was crucial for eradicating the centuries-old caste system and discriminations.

“The SC/ST reservation in government jobs besides in the Indian legislature is vital for ensuring socio-economic justice for the community,” he said.

Workers called it quits on Tuesday. They filled up the pits dug up for planting saplings and left

HYDERABAD: Renovation and beautification works of the historic Badshahi Ashurkhana in Old City was stopped abruptly on Tuesday due to political interference. Badshahi Ashurkhana is the second oldest building in Hyderabad and officials took up conservation works on the instructions of the high court.

While the department of heritage is looking after renovation works, the GHMC has taken up beautification of the area outside the Ashurkhana entrance. Civic body workers had dug up pits to plant saplings and create two landscaped gardens on either side of the main gate.

But suddenly on Tuesday, the workers filled up the pits and left, said Mir Abbas Ali Moosvi, Mutavalli (custodian) of the Badshahi Ashurkhana. He alleged that a local politician had prevailed upon civic officials to stop the beautification work so that the area could be re-allotted to hawkers, who were evicted during an anti-encroachment drive. The encroachments around the structure were removed following intervention of the HC about a decade ago.

“Since then, the area on either side of the main gate has been lying idle, and there are efforts to encroach upon them. We requested the GHMC to take up beautification works to prevent encroachments. But even as the work was half way through, it was abandoned. A local politician had ensured that the work is stopped,” Moosvi told TOI.

Badshahi Ashurkhana is the second oldest structure in Hyderabad south of Musi river. It was constructed in 1594AD, three years after Charminar by Qutub Shahi king Mohammad Quli Qutub Shah. It is a protected monument but due to centuries of neglect it fell on bad days. While the main building was waterproofed to prevent soaking of rain water, Naqqar Khana, Aabdana, and ancillary structures lay in ruins. There have been no efforts to restore them.

According to INTACH city convener, P Anuradha Reddy, soon after the shifting of the capital from Golconda to Hyderabad, the Qutub Shahis built Charminar. It was followed by Badshahi Ashurkhana and Darul Shifa, the first multi-storied government hospital in these parts of the world. The Ashurkhana was the centre of attraction and prime structure during the Qutub Shahi period. The rulers would lit it up during Moharram.

Abbas Ali Moosvi said the enamel work inside the building is still fresh. It is a masterpiece of Persian enamel work. “Unfortunately, there is none to look after the building, though Agha Khan trust takes care of certain things. It needs regular flow of funds for upkeep. Though the Ashurkhana was built in 1594AD, the enamel work was carried out in 1611AD.

Ali Asgar Bilgrami, who served as director of Hyderabad archaeology department in 1920s, had named Ashurkhana as older than Imam Baras of Hooghly and Lucknow. While ancillary units are in ruins, the main building is in secondary stage of dilapidation. It houses 14 diamond-studded alams.

New Delhi: The city’s perennial air pollution problem showed no signs of going away, with another grim reminder coming just after Diwali.

While Delhi witnessed its cleanest September in nine years, pollution levels started spiking at the end of October and the Air Quality Index touched 494 on November 3, the highest since November 2016. The spike occurred post-Diwali, with stubble burning and firecracker emissions creating a deadly cocktail of toxins in the air.

A blame game began soon after with Delhi government saying stubble burning in neighbouring states was the main problem. Though Punjab and Haryana distributed Happy Seeders and fined farmers, little changed. Punjab actually showed an increase in the number of farm fires.

Till November 25, Punjab recorded 52,942 stubble burning cases compared with 51,751 in 2018. Haryana and Uttar Pradesh both showed a sharp decline in farm fires. Indian Council of Agricultural Research data showed a decline of 52% in the total farm fires in the three states in October-November this year compared with 2016. In 2016, the states had reported 1.27 lakh incidents of stubble burning. It declined to 88,948 in 2017, 75,532 in 2018 and 61,332 in 2019 with Punjab being the biggest culprit all these years.

Like every year, government bodies, corporations and agencies were most active in October and November. Delhi, Punjab and Haryana facing the wrath of Supreme Court, which said it was better to kill people in one go than to let them live and suffer in gas chambers. SC also rapped Delhi government over delay in tackling pollution and said that the odd-even scheme, which was implemented from November 4-15, seemed to have little impact. The apex court also suggested new solutions and technologies. Asked to try out hydrogen-based fuels, commonly used in Japan, to experimenting with smog towers and anti-smog guns, Delhi government has started working on an anti-smog tower pilot project, which could be ready in three months.

Long-term data showed the situation was gradually improving. Delhi government cited CPCB’s data saying there had been a reduction in the average annual PM2.5 this year. The average PM concentration came down from 154 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) in 2012-2014 to 115 µg/m3 in 2016-2018, CPCB data showed. CSE said another 65% reduction was required for Delhi to meet the standards.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After the state assembly passed a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Union law and telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Tuesday that only Parliament has exclusive powers to pass any laws in this regard.

“It is only the Parliament, which has got the powers to make any law with regard to citizenship; not any other assembly, including the Kerala assembly,” he said, quoting Article 246 from the Constitution. “I would urge the chief minister to kindly seek better legal advice,” he said. Prasad was in the state as part of the campaign to clear the air on CAA. Condemning the unruly incidents that took place in the History Congress at Kannur University, he said it has become clear that those who talk of curbing dissent were themselves slipping into repressive mode.

“I condemn what happened with the governor of the state,” he said, adding that so-called eminent people were seen pushing the governor. “These are the people who are not willing to hear the counterview even from the governor…Irfan Habib is a Leftist, and is entitled to his views, but he must listen to the counterviews also,” Prasad said.

On the CAA, Prasad said it was perfectly constitutional and legal. “I am saying this as a party worker as well as the law minister of India. The CAA is not related to any Indian, Muslim included. It is only related to persecuted communities in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh who are being singled out for persecution because of their faith. All these three countries are declared Islamic republics,” Prasad said.

He said it was not the first time that the country is giving citizenship to people from other countries. “When President Idi Amin of Uganda turned out thousands of Hindus from Uganda, Indira Gandhi gave them refuge. When the Sri Lankan Tamil crisis was going on, lakhs of Tamil Sri Lankans were given citizenship in India. Former PM Manmohan Singh has publicly demanded that they be given citizenship. So did Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot and former Assam CM Tarun Gogoi,” he said.

He said the population register was the register of usual Indian residents and the data were used for development and for framing policy for both the Centre as well as state governments. With regards to the National Register of Citizens, he said PM Modi has clearly stated that no decision has been taken regarding it.

HYDERABAD: Soon, the 108 ambulance services might be handled by Aurobindo Pharma Foundation, said highly placed sources from within the Telangana health department. It is learnt that the foundation’s proposal, floated after the department called for tenders from corporate companies to take over 108, has been tabled before the chief minister, and is the final stages of being cleared.

The ambulances are currently taken care of by GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute (EMRI). The plan to outsource the operations is aimed at increasing coverage of districts and villages by 108 ambulances. At present, there are 358 ambulances of which around 25 are kept in reserve, while the remaining are plying on roads. With the upgrade, the number of ambulances is also expected to be increased so as to cover over 500 zones across the state, each with an ambulance at its disposal.

Further, sources said, the foundation has proposed to bring about automation in dispatch of ambulances, automatic call distribution, GPS integration and computer-telephone interface among other measures. Aurobindo’s proposal also talks about cutting short the time taken to reach an accident spot by introducing GPS identification of the accident scene, which is currently missing. While first responder teams will be set up in all villages in the future, satellite trauma centres will be set up along national highways, as per the plan. “An integrated emergency management application will GIS functionality that can meet current and future requirements of emergency management. The application can be integrated with other disaster management facilities available in the state, like police and fires services. Also all vehicles will be fitted with customised GPS/ automatic vehicle location tracking equipment for tracking the exact location and movement of vehicles in real time,” read the proposal.

It has assured high level of employee satisfaction and ensure that no protests and strikes happen, said insiders.

Pune: A 35-year-old businessman was booked on Monday on the charges of submitting forged birth certificate of his step-son during the passport verification process at the Sahakarnagar police station.

The man, his wife and their minor son had applied for passports, following which they were asked to submit relevant documents for police verification. Their interview was scheduled for September 19, 2019.

“They duo had submitted all the relevant documents, including their son’s birth certificate. However, when asked about the minor’s date and place of birth during the interview round at the police station, the couple gave separate answers. This made the verifying officer suspicious and the man was booked,” assistant inspector of Sahakarnagar police Suhas Patil told TOI.

He said, “We suspect their son’s birth certificate — issued by the medical authorities of Rajasthan government — to be forged. Our team would soon visit Rajasthan to verify the authenticity of the document.”

Patil said the man and his wife has been staying in the city for over six years. The 35-year-old runs a glass business on Satara Road.

“Prima facie probe revealed that the man is the step-father of the minor boy. It is suspected that the woman forged her son’s birth certificate in Rajasthan. We are yet to figure out the reason for the forgery,” another police officer said.

129,['1/01/2020'],"Seeking important ministeries, Thorat &amp; Chavan to meet CM","This story is from January 1, 2020

Nagpur: Even as portfolios are yet to be allocated to the newly sworn-in group of 36 ministers, reports are emerging that the Congress high command in Delhi is sour over getting ‘lower-rung’ ministries as compared to its Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners Shiv Sena and NCP. It’s learnt that this is the reason why portfolios have not been announced a day after the swearing-in ceremony.

According to senior functionaries, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Balasaheb Thorat and former chief minister Ashok Chavan would be meeting CM Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday to convey and discuss the high command’s message.

“Since our party feels that it was provided with ministries of less importance, Thorat and Chavan would request Thackeray to exchange a few. Even party MLAs felt that they have not been given proper representation in the cabinet expansion,” a senior leader from Vidarbha told TOI.

The Congress legislators were also disappointed that former CM Prithviraj Chavan was not a minister. “Allotment of ministries with lesser significance may be a reason to drop Chavan’s name, as no major portfolio was left after revenue and PWD was shared by Thorat and Raut, respectively. There were indications that NCP had opposed Chavan’s name as investigations into the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC) and multi-crore irrigation scams where the Pawars are named were initiated by him,” they said.

As per the common minimum programme (CMP) fixed by the three coalition partners before government’s formation, the Sena with 56 seats would get 16 ministries, NCP with 54 seats would have 14, while Congress which was relegated to fourth place after assembly polls with 44 seats, was allotted 12 portfolios.

Thiruvananthapuram: The opposition, while taking part in the discussions in the assembly for passing a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on Tuesday, urged the state government to implead in the case before the Supreme Court against the implementation of the Act.

Asserting that the CAA cannot be ignored as an isolated move but only in connection with the NPR (National Population Register) and NRC (National Register of Citizens), opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said he has already filed a case in the apex court against the Act and asked the state to join as a plaintiff in the case.

“The state also should stay away from initiating any procedures to facilitate the census, in which the newly added questions have made people apprehensive,” he said, reiterating his earlier demand for sending an all-party delegation to meet the President and ask for a repeal of the legislation.

He also said that the nation was facing the biggest challenge post-Independence. “The BJP government is trying to divide the nation on communal lines. The Centre did not follow international conventions while making amendment to the Citizenship Act, and now several countries have cancelled their diplomatic visits. It has also affected the foreign tourists’ inflow,” he said.

Joining the discussions, IUML legislative party leader M K Muneer said no one can question the patriotism of people who have fought for India’s freedom and contributed immensely in its progress, and that people like him will not produce any documents to prove their lineage.

“It’s not an issue of Muslims. Tomorrow, they will target dalits, Christians, the third gender, and even several castes and communities in Hindu religion. The RSS agenda is to implement the fascist theories of its ideologue M S Golwalkar,” he said. Muneer also called upon the state government to show restraint while handling protesters ‘as this is a second freedom struggle’.

Among those from the UDF who raised their concerns against the CAA were V D Satheesan, Mons Joseph, Shafi Parambil and Anoop Jacob, while participants from the LDF in the discussions included James Mathew, C Divakaran, K V Abdul Khader, Mathew T Thomas and M Swaraj, among others.

131,['1/01/2020'],Drive to clear footpaths to kick off from today,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Nagpur: Unfazed by attack and threats, mayor Sandip Joshi on Tuesday announced commencement of three-month long intensive drive to free footpaths and roads from encroachments. Hefty penalty will also be levied on the encroachers with the commencement of new calender year.

Joshi also announced stringent action against various types of nuisances by increasing the strength of the nuisance detection squad (NDS) which will also work in second shift from 4pm to 12 midnight. The NDS will seize and levy fines on those selling plastic kite, nylon manja and those using plastic in preparing bouquets.

Considering suggestions and complaints received from people related to facility of public toilets, Joshi said public toilets at 87 petrol pumps will be opened for public from January 1. A total of 75 new public toilets will be constructed before December 31 and two abandoned city buses will be converted into T-mobile cafeteria and women special toilet. The NDS will also expedite action on urination and defecation in open,” he said.

Joshi said the action against encroachments on footpaths and roads will be taken as per the new policy submitted by a committee-headed by Dayashankar Tiwari. “Standing committee, followed by general body, will approve the policy soon. Municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar has already implemented it using his powers. The policy aims to make footpaths and roads walkable and induce fear among encroachers, hawkers. Works of Rs7 crore are planned to ensure hassle-free footpaths,” he said.

“Till now, the NMC used to recover less fine and return back materials seized during the drive. Now onwards, hefty penalty will be levied for the first time which will be doubled in the second instance. Shopkeepers will not be given their materials back. The hawkers will be given materials back for the first two times but not from the third time onwards,” sources said.

Bangar said the demolition of encroachments done by shopkeepers on footpath will start from January 1. “Earlier, a team from the NMC headquarters with the help of a few staffers from zone used to remove encroachments only in a particular area in a day. Now, we have prepared zone-wise enforcement teams which will ensure action across the city. We will select some pockets where the drive will be conducted in a repeated manner. During this drive, the process to appoint enforcement team in all the ten zones will be appointed on a permanent basis. Apart from police, five personnel of NDS will accompany the enforcement team in ten zones,” he said.

Joshi added the policy to seize open plots comprising garbage and filth will be approved soon. “Till now, the NMC used to levy fine on such open plots. We found some provisions to seize such plots. The NMC will erect a board on open plot giving a warning after which the plot will be seized. We will begin the action from a plot situated on Inner Ring Road near Khamla Square,” he said.

Joshi also said the strength of NDS has been increased to 203. “Till now, NDS was functioning with 87 personnel. It has levied a penalty of Rs2.75 crore for various types of nuisances in one year. The NDS was working only during day time. Now, 153 personnel will work in morning shift and remaining 50 in second shift from 4pm to 12 midnight. NDS will also take action under Single Use Plastic Eradication Scheme,” he said.

On Tuesday, NDS seized 25 plastic kites and recovered fine of Rs500 in Mangalwari zone. Joshi and Bangar have proposed to develop Smart Kiosks which are basically dedicated food zones. Action on hawkers will be taken after developing these zones. The first zone will be developed along VIP road behind Children Traffic Park.

Pinarayi Vijayan

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The second session of the Loka Kerala Sabha is being convened with the satisfaction that it has been transformed to a forum which discusses and finds a solution to all issues of expats and utilises their potential in the best possible way, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said.

In his article on the eve of the second edition of the Loka Kerala Sabha to be held in the capital from Wednesday, the chief minister said that the state government does not view it as a formal or a decorative forum, but a practical forum that will implement what has been said.

“The best example is the decision to form a secretariat in the first edition. Also, seven standing committees were formed and all their recommendations were compiled and implemented. This shows the commitment of the state government towards non-resident Keralites,” he said.

The chief minister said that the investment company Overseas Keralites Investment and Holding Ltd was formed to ensure that the remittances from NRKs which is almost equivalent to 30% of the GDP of the state does not get scattered. The company was formed by collecting 74% of the investment capital from NRKs and the rest being invested by the state government. He also said that government could also set up a special cell for NRK women, an NRK facilitation centre, a pre-departure orientation centre, high-power committee for skill development, etc, within this timeframe.

The chief minister said that with Loka Kerala Sabha, all issues commonly faced by NRKs can be addressed, whereas earlier, individual cases were being dealt with separately. He said that one of the main issues faced by NRKs is the uncontrolled airfare to Gulf countries. The state government could ensure more services in the Gulf sector through the intervention of the ministry of civil aviation. He said that a forum like Loka Kerala Sabha is inevitable in ensuring that the contributions and potential of the NRK community is utilsied for the development of the state.

Pune: Flight services from the city airport were slightly better on Tuesday than a day before with the weather condition in the national capital showing signs of improvement.

Around 10 flights reaching and leaving the city were delayed between 6am and 6pm on Tuesday. In contrast, over 20 flights were delayed on Monday. No flight was cancelled on Tuesday as against Monday’s six cancellations.

“Flight movements remained largely normal (on Tuesday). The number of delays was less and the durations were moderate. The Delhi airport authorities tweeted in the morning that all their flight operations were normal,” an official at the Lohegaon airport said.

“Flights to destinations such as Hyderabad, Ozar, Bengaluru, Goa and Ahmedabad were delayed. But the situation was not as chaotic as Monday’s,” the official said.

The situation improved following a change in the condition in the North. “Clear weather, no fog. All flight operations are normal at the Delhi airport,” the Twitter handle of the Delhi airport posted on Tuesday.

Advisories for the flyers, however, poured in from many airlines about destinations other than Delhi. SpiceJet stated, “Due to bad weather at Kanpur and Varanasi, all departures/arrivals and their consequential flights might get affected.” Vistara mentioned that flights to and from Varanasi could be affected because of the bad weather.

Flyers had a harrowing time at the Pune airport on Monday evening. An Pune-New Delhi Air Asia flight (I5732) was supposed to take off at 6:30pm, but finally left the city after 11:30pm. A Vistara flight for Delhi took off from Pune after 1.30am on Tuesday as against its scheduled departure at 8:20pm.

Pune: The state government has fixed the age criteria for admission during 2020-2021 academic year in all schools. The cut-off date has been set as September 30, 2020. Students completing three years on this date will be admitted to nursery and those completing six years on or before the cut-off date can take admission to standard I.

The education department released the guidelines as many private schools have already started conducting admissions using different cut-off dates. Cut-off dates vary from school-to-school.

As per the Right to Education (RTE) Act, a child should have attained six years to be admitted in standard I and three years for nursery. Many schools have begun their admissions, especially, the CBSE affiliated schools, as their academic sessions begins in April.

Education department director Dattatray Jagtap has notified that the schools should follow a uniform cut-off date of September 30.

Jagtap said, “This is an annual practice and the state government based on the RTE Act has always been setting up the cut-off date usually announced in December and set for September 30.”

According to the education department, the age criteria for junior and senior kindergarten will also vary. A school principal said, “The education department should issue such guidelines much in advance. We have almost finished with the admissions and the notification cannot come so late and we cannot conduct the entire process all over again.”

The cut-off date is usually tricky for principals as there is pressure from the management to consider some exceptions for admission because the child may lose out by few days, another principal said.

Applicable To All Boards

* Age six is the minimum for admission to standard I in the state

* The cut-off date for calculating age be September 30, 2020

* The minimum age for admission to nursery or playgroup will be three years

* By the time these children reach standard I, they were at least six years old, as is required under the Right to Education Act

* Schools with nursery or playgroup as the entry level will have to admit students who have completed three years as on September 30, 2020

Age -- Class

3 years -- Nursery

4 years -- L Kg

5 years -- Sr Kg

6 years -- Standard I

Pune: Two almost back-to-back elections in 2019 — one for the Lok Sabha and the other for the state Assembly — have delayed uploading of land grant orders under rehabilitation projects on the website of the district collectorate.

Over 25,800 beneficiaries in the district were supposed to be granted land of nearly 2,300 hectares for over 25 projects. The process was made online for maintaining transparency, tracking the orders and the individuals’ details and eliminating any confusion between department officials.

However, Only 60 land grant orders have been uploaded on the collectorate’s website (on pune.nic.in/documents/other) as part of the pilot project implemented in Pune district.

The orders issued from January 2019 were supposed to be uploaded under the pilot project, for which Rs5 lakh was sanctioned from the district development funds for special projects.

Pune district rehabilitation officer (DRO) B Waghmare said the pending documents would be uploaded on the website soon. “The task is difficult, but not impossible. We can commence it this year. The pending orders can be scanned and subsequently uploaded,” he said.

Senior officials in the rehabilitation department conceded about the delay in uploading the orders online in the election year. “The alleged Shirur land scam should be the trigger for the state government to go for this project,” an official said.

Arun M Kumar, currently the chairman and CEO of KPMG-India , had served as assistant secretary of commerce for global markets and the director general of the US and foreign commercial service under Obama administration. In an interview with TOI, Kumar shared his view that the Indian economy will be benefited by various reforms like GST and bankruptcy code . He also said that India could benefit from the ongoing US-China trade war . Excerpts from the interview:

How do you see 2020 and the decade ahead?

Progress is rarely a straight line. 2019 was a year in which many upward trends took a pause. Uncertainties around the world, including the US-China trade situation and Brexit made economic headwinds, and India was affected as well. Even so, India continued to attract investment and the growth of entrepreneurship remained unabated. Such interregnums can have their benefits, if companies and countries use them to become more competitive. India’s GDP grew by a factor of 2.2 over the last decade. Looking out over the next decade, especially given the aspiration and energy of India’s young people, India should emerge as one of the top three economic powers in the world.

Will India be benefited by the ongoing US-China trade war?

There is an opportunity for trade diversion. In some areas, it is already happening with mobile phones being made here. There is definitely a big opportunity to take on some of the manufacturing happening in China – one in the context of the US-China trade war, and the other is based on the changing economics of China. There is an opportunity for India and other countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh to take on the manufacturing of various products. India has to prepare carefully in multiple ways and the government has identified several areas. We ourselves have prepared some studies like which are the kind of products and companies that will be interested in reconfiguring their supply chain to go through India.

Modi government had been bringing in many reforms that have serious effects on businesses and industries. How do you see their impact?

There are two important reforms. One is GST. It is very important that goods can move across the country faster. It was a Constitutional innovation to get the states and the Centre to work together to agree on standard rates across the country. Yes, there were some hiccups and some will continue. The second one is the bankruptcy code. It is important and timely because right now, you are dealing with a lot of non-performing assets.

Is the Indian economy really strong enough for all these reforms?

In the long-term, you have to have these changes. Otherwise, you can’t have a dynamic and competitive economy. GST is a good example. One of the areas where India lags behind China is logistics costs. Your labour costs might be low, but if your logistics costs are high, you can’t be competitive. So, GST is one and the infrastructure spending is the other one. Better roads and bridges increase competitiveness. We need more productivity and exports, and all the benefits of high competitiveness lead to high income.

Which are the sectors that are going to have two-digit growth?

In Kerala, it is tourism. Kerala is a good example, but the whole country has got so many (tourist) attractions. It is like infrastructure becomes important and the good progress made regarding airports. I think transportation and infrastructure really boost tourism. And, tourism is job-creating. Nationwide, there are many service sectors (that should have a high growth rate), and although we have a slump in automotive, it will come back up again. The country is going to have more cars, as the energy and aspiration of the middle class and those entering the middle class are quite incredible.

The resolution was moved by CPM leader and former deputy mayor Varghese Kanamkulathi and the leader of opposition Mukundan of the Congress supported it.

However, the BJP councillors started shouting slogans alleging that the resolution was against the Constitution. According to them, the corporation council had no right to pass a resolution against an Act which has come into force after both the houses of Parliament approved it and the President gave assent.

The LDF and UDF councillors however said the corporation council was well within its rights to express the opinions of the councillors on an Act which went against the basic secular ethos of the Indian Constitution.

The resolution was unanimously approved by the council after the BJP members staged a boycott. Mayor Ajitha Vijayan presided over the function.

Notices had been issued to 42 leases holders to file their final reply in the matter

PANAJI: The directorate of mines and geology (DGM) has said that orders for recovery of money from illegal mining , based on the audit report submitted by the team of chartered accounts, will be passed in the new year.

Mines director Ashutosh Apte told TOI that the department is studying the data in order to pass recovery orders. “The orders will be issued in the new year,” Apte said.

Notices had been issued to 42 leases holders to file their final reply in the matter. In October, the department had started the final hearing, based on the audit report, to recover money lost to illegal mining.

Earlier, the department had evaluated the replies filed by holders of 118 mining leases to the audit report submitted by the team of chartered accountants.

In 2015, the state government had appointed 15 chartered accountants to undertake a comprehensive audit of lease holders and traders of mineral ore in Goa during the last five years, when exports touched peak figures.

The accountants had submitted an audit report of 118 mining leases to the mines department . Subsequently, the department analysed the report to ascertain the exact loss to the state owing to illegal mining.

Based on the analysis, showcause notices were issued to the mining companies. Later, the mining companies submitted their replies and hearings were conducted.

However, the charter accountants are yet to begin the audit of 260 iron ore traders. Around 464 traders are registered with the mines department, out of which over 260 traders were involved in the mining business from 2007 till September 2012, the officer said.

The chartered accountants were asked to examine the exact quantity of ore extracted, exported, amount of royalty paid, export duty, ore (if any) sourced from other state, etc.

The Shah Commission report on illegal mining, which had exposed a series of irregularities in the state’s mining activities, had pegged the loss of revenue to the government from the mining scam at Rs 35,000 crore.

Former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had assured the Goa assembly in July 2012 that a team of chartered accountants would be engaged to conduct an audit of all ore export-related activities during the past five years.

So, we are planning to switch to cloth bag manufacturing,” said Mahila Mandir superintendent Beena F R. Many firms, including Kerala Khadi and Village Industries, have placed orders for paper bags. “We are unable to manufacture such a huge quantity of paper bags. So, we are giving training to Kudumbashree workers on manufacturing of paper bags and cloth bags,” she said.

They supply paper bags to the firms like Beverages Corporation. “It is from textile firms that we get maximum orders. We expect that we will be able to outsource the excess work to Kudumbashree workers,” an employee with Mahila Mandir said.

It was almost three years ago that a paper bag manufacturing unit was started at the Mahila Mandir, functioning under social justice department. “The initial cost was Rs 7 lakh. Later on, the unit started getting orders. But, there was slump post flood. But, it was soon overcome. With the ban on single-use plastic coming into effect on Wednesday, the prospects of the firm are getting brighter,” said V P Chandran, councillor representing Chambakkara division. “Such endeavours can be helpful in ushering positive changes in the society,” he said.

Most of the residents are destitute while some of them come to the Mandir for a short stay. “It is those like the victims of domestic violence who avail short stay. Moreover, there are some residents who are sent by the courts as they are unable to go back to their homes due to peculiar circumstances,” said a source.

144,['1/01/2020'],"Citizens’ groups oppose IBC amendment ordinance, claim their voices went unheard","This story is from January 1, 2020

Pune: Citizens’ groups across the country expressed their displeasure over the ordinance for the amendment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, recently approved by the Union cabinet, claiming that their say was not taken into consideration.

Calling it a largely pro-builder amendment, they claimed that the clause stating that homebuyers willing to take the developer to an insolvency court would have to ensure that a minimum of 100 homebuyers or 10% of the total homebuyers filed for bankruptcy against the developer seemed practically impossible at a given time.

“The specific number seems highly impossible for a citizen wanting to raise a complaint against the developer. A citizen should have had the right to file his/her complaint at individual-level,” said Abhay Upadhayay, the president of Forum for People’s Collective Efforts.

The forum had written to the Prime Minister to stop any proposed amendments in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), diluting the rights of flat owners. It received mass support on social media but its say was not considered, claimed the members of the group.

The ordinance was passed without taking the view of the consumers or homebuyers, they stated.

“The government should have at least called us for a discussion so that we could put forth the practical difficulties,” stressed the consumers across India.

Under the IBC, a single creditor (operational/financial) having a due of Rs1 lakh or more could drag a corporate entity to the NCLT. Against this backdrop, how a single homebuyer could be barred whose financial stake would be many times more than this amount, questioned consumers.

“It is absurd to demand that the accused should not be dragged to a court of law till his victims find others and joins hands to become eligible to approach a court of law. It is akin to saying that no one should approach a police station against a person guilty of murder till kin of other victims of the murderer joined hands,” said a consumer peeved with the move.

The proposed amendment was to provide protection to buyers from criminal proceedings against previous promoters of a bankrupt firm. But there were several loopholes in it, the buyers pointed out.

Under the amendments, the liability of a corporate debtor for an offence committed prior to the commencement of the corporate insolvency resolution would cease and it would be the same if there was a change in the management of the corporate debtor.

The government in the ordinance stated that the amendment was expected to remove ambiguities in the IBC and ensure smooth implementation of the code. The amendment paved the way for the initiation of insolvency proceedings against the real estate entity only if a group of creditors approved it.

RAJKOT: A young police constable posted in Thorala police station committed suicide by hanging at his house in the official government quarters in Marutinagar after Monday midnight.

Ashish Dave, 25, who was also a promising hockey player, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his house. Dave, who is posted in Thorala’s detection staff, had used a dupatta and chair to hang himself. At around 1:30pm, his wife Anjali, who was sleeping in their bedroom woke up hearing the noise of falling chair. She saw that Dave was not there and went to the other room to check. Much to her horror, she saw him hanging and started screaming for help.

Neighbours rushed there and called the 108 emergency ambulance, but Dave was already dead by then.

Senior police officials said Dave had not left any suicide note and they are trying to find out the reason behind the drastic step.

Sources said that Dave had taken leave for two days saying that his wife was unwell. On Monday evening too, some of his colleagues had casually called him up and asked him his New Year plans. He denied having any plans and told them also that Anjali was unwell. People close to him also said that Dave was behaving normally till he went on leave and did not show any signs of being disturbed. He did not face any financial problems or serious illness too, police department sources said.

Thorala police station sources said that Anjali had two miscarriages in the couple’s six years of marriage. Anjali was also a hockey player and the two had met during some match six years ago. After a brief courtship, they got married.

Till recently, Dave stayed with his elder brother Hiren and mother at the latter’s house in Railnagar. He shifted to Marutinagar police quarters recently with Anjali.

Panaji: Goa’s water requirement is steadily increasing and Bardez taluka is one area where demand is rapidly rising. This had put stress on the Assonora water treatment plant, which treats 105MLD to 110MLD water daily for the taluka and parts of Bicholim, leading to it developing leaks in many places.

However, carrying out repairs is difficult as it would mean giving the plant prolonged rest for the duration of the maintenance work which would in turn mean Bardez and parts of Bicholim will have to go without drinking water supply.

The PWD has identified some major areas of leakages which will be repaired on priority to resolve at least part of the problem for now. For this restricted water will be supplied to Bardez and parts of Bicholim on January 4 and 5 to facilitate repair works.

“There are some leakages in the plant and water is getting wasted. There are some places which need urgent repairs. Such points have been identified and the material has already been arranged so that no time is wasted in carrying out the repair works. The plant will be shut down for a day and work can be completed within this short time,” an official said.

The Assonora plant currently receives water from the Amthane reservoir where water is pumped in from the Sal for treatment.

HYDERABAD: The polluted waters of Hussainsagar may not support marine life any more but they are surely giving wings to the dreams of many young, underprivileged sailors and infusing new life into their dreams of achieving ‘Dignity Through Sports’. The Yacht Club of Hyderabad (YCH) has taken under its wings many boys and girls from low-income groups. These kids virtually didn’t have much of a life as their parents couldn’t even think of giving them a decent education. YCH has put the wind under their sails and some of these kids are now sailing on in life. Preethi Kongari, Majji Lalitha, Mehboobie Tungara, Jaikiran Bolli, Vijay Kumar, Gowtham Kankatla and Durga Prasad are among a host of them who have found a new purpose in life.

The success stories of these kids bring a smile to Suheim Sheikh, who had the courage to dream of a day when Hussainsagar would be teeming with sailors of all classes. The YCH sailors have won dozens of national and international medals. Ten YCH boys have also been absorbed into the sailing schools of the armed forces.

“If you look at all sportspersons who have made it big, it’s because they had access to the sport. Desire, drive and determination are needed but the most important factor for success is access. That was lacking for sailors in the city,” Suheim said. He considers himself lucky to have access to sailing. “My father was a member of the sailing club and so I had the privilege to sail. I loved the sport and was involved in it for nearly 20 years before dropping it to earn a living,” said Suheim, who is an IIT Madras graduate and ran a software company.

He, however, couldn’t remain in that world as his calling was different. He quit and got back to sailing. “When I came back, I saw that many couldn’t have access to the waters and hence the pool of sailors was very less in the city,” said Suheim, who got inspired to help children from poor backgrounds to take up sailing.

It took him nearly three years to get going. The main problem was the lack of access to the lake. “I approached the municipal commissioner and presented the idea to him. He liked it and said I could start the club at Sanjeevaiah Park .”

The YCH was founded on June 5, 2019 – World Environment Day . It began with three little boats and four sailors. Now, they have a fleet of 140 boats and over 100 sailors.

YCH is a not-for-profit body and apart from coaching sailors they have also been able to cater to the educational and nutritional needs of these kids. “As they come from families that cannot afford three meals a day, we took it upon ourselves to cater to their diet too,” Suheim said.

Over the last few years, Suheim has shifted his focus to girl sailors. “A couple of years ago when I had taken some of our boys for an event in Pune, one of my friends asked me why there were no girl sailors. Since then I have realised that empowering the girl child is very important.”

YCH and Nandi Foundation started Project Naavika and the results have been astounding. Preethi became the first girl ever to win the Monsoon Regatta this year. Seven of these girls go to the same training facility that PV Sindhu goes to. Thanks to Praveen Raju, the YCH girls have access to the gym at Suchitra Academy.

Suheim has had to fund the YCH from his own resources but doesn’t regret. “A man doesn’t need much to live. I am lucky to have the resources to take care of my needs. My wife, too, has been very supportive,” he said.

After investing his life into the project for the last 10 years, what has he gained? “Satisfaction. Seeing changes in the lives of these kids gives me immense satisfaction,” said Suheim, who has been awarded the Admiral Kohli Trophy by the Yachting Association of India in October this year for promoting the sport.

Thiruvananthapuram: The crime branch team probing the tax evasion case against actor and BJP MP Suresh Gopi , who allegedly registered his two luxury cars in the Union Territory of Puducherry , has completed the probe and filed a chargesheet before the Thiruvananthapuram chief judicial magistrate court.

The CB stated in its chargesheet that Gopi had registered his two Audi cars priced at Rs 60 lakh and Rs 80 lakh each in Puducherry by producing fake documents. He showed his residency as Karthika Apartment at Ellaippillai Chavady in Puducherry. He claimed to be a tenant in the apartment and managed to get a notary attest his rental agreement. He also secured an LIC policy in his name in this address. Though the actor tried to influence the apartment owner after the case was registered, the owner gave his statement against the MP when the investigation team questioned him.

He told the investigators that he did not know the actor. The notary too told the investigation team that his signature and rubber stamp on the agreement were forged. Through this fraud, the actor-turned politician evaded paying tax of Rs 3.60 lakh and Rs 16 lakh for each car, the probe team said.

The CB had registered the case against Gopi while probing the backgrounds of 272 luxury cars that were plying on Kerala roads with PY registration. They registered 16 cases in this regard. Besides Suresh Gopi, actor Fahadh Fazil was also found to be using vehicles with Puducherry registration. Fazil later paid the actual tax.

RAJKOT: A suspended head constable , who was arrested in a graft case last month , was on Tuesday booked for having disproportionate assets against his known sources of income by the Rajkot division of anti-corruption bureau (ACB).

Investigation officer, M M Sarvaiya of Devbhoomi Dwarka ACB, said that Zala was arrested for taking Rs 7,000 bribe as hush-up money not to harass an accused in lock-up when he was posted with the B Division police station in Jamnagar.

TRICHY: Utilising the vacant space adjacent to Mambalasalai road near the Cauvery bridge in Srirangam , the corporation has launched civil work on an open-air gymnasium to encourage residents indulge in physical activity.

The corporation said that the vacant space adjacent to Mambalasalai road, sandwiched between the abandoned and new Cauvery bridge was encroached by hawkers. As the land with native trees belong to the state highways department, Trichy Corporation recently obtained permission to clear the space and utilise the area for developing an open-air gym.

The civil work on the 4,000 square feet space was launched last week. “The vacant space was encroached and littered with waste. Though the proposal was mooted in the middle of 2019, there was a delay in obtaining permission from the highways department,” an official with Trichy Corporation said.

Preliminary work such as filling and levelling the ground besides erecting compound wall is being carried out.

At an estimated cost of Rs 22 lakh, six simple gym equipment including tai chi wheels and double-cross walker that can be operated with little effort even by senior citizens shall be placed in the gym space.

“We will completely fence the area adjacent to Mambalasalai with steel bars to ensure the safety of gym users. Entrance for the open-air gym will be positioned on the old Cauvery bridge side,” the civic body official added. Utilising the existing green cover, 10 granite stone benches will be installed. The gym is likely to be made available for public use by the end of this month.

161,['1/01/2020'],When art has politics at heart,"This story is from January 1, 2020

By Gowri Ramanarayan

CHENNAI: The 92-year-old violin maestro T N Krishnan performing a glorious concert on Christmas morning at the packed Madras Music Academy was by itself perhaps the most memorable moment of this music season. But just as you marvelled at the sweep of imagination and sighed over ""Sankarabharanam"", his strings broke into ""Jingle Bells"", wishing everyone a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. That is how, in these times of strife, a master musician reminded us of the values guaranteed by our Constitution.

The Christmas spirit pervaded the intimate ‘arangam’ space as well, where Bharatanatyam artist Geeta Chandran celebrated the birth of Christ with a lullaby to baby Krishna, and a Kabir poem about finding the garden of beauty within each of us. Not merely poignant ‘abhinaya’, but a message of peace.

Tradition, heritage, marabu, parampara — we know they are inextricable from the classical music and dance flooding Chennai sabhas in December. But it would be good to remember that this tradition, unmistakably identified with the Hindu faith, is not with blind hatred toward other beliefs. Nor does it remain static.

In the past, classicism did not mean imperviousness to socio-political currents. Several Old Madras musicians had risked imprisonment for sedition with ""nationalist"" songs against the British Raj, wore khadi, supported social reform, promoted Gandhian values and chanted ""Ishwar Allah tero naam"". M S Subbulakshmi continued to maintain this spirit as she intoned ""Bismillah ir-rahman ir-raheem"" with the same devotion she expressed in her ""Vishnu Sahasranamam"". D K Pattammal’s signature anthem spoke of peace and unity as Gandhi’s vision.

Though music and dance in free India have been more about structure and presentational methods to accommodate changing audience tastes, shifts in politics and society do affect performance. Certain age-old songs have been dropped or edited to match the mood of the times. A few performers have started avoiding compositions now seen as degrading women. Composer Gopalakrishna Bharati’s poignant songs extol the nobility of the outcaste Nandan, but a young Ashwath Narayanan or a Ramakrishnan Murthy follows the more recent practice of substituting neutral, universal terms like deenan (helpless) or ezhai (destitute) for the original words. A rare example was the replacing of ""andanar"" (brahmin) with ""maanudar"" (human being) in a Tamil hymn.

In dance recitals and dance dramas based on mythological grids, many old approaches seem ideologically out of date. The Surpanakha episode in the Ramayana can no longer be treated as a comic interlude as was done in the past. However, audiences can sometimes create new meanings with their ironic re-interpretations, as seen when ‘Kurmavartaram’ was staged at the Bharata Kalakshetra auditorium. Choreographed by Rukmini Devi, this classic depicts the story of how the gods lure the demons to join them in the struggle to extract the elixir which guarantees immortality. Disguised as a bewitching woman, Lord Vishnu tricks the demons out of their promised share.

The viewers were certainly moved by the devotional elements in this story of Vishnu’s avatar, and applauded the dynamic artists with gusto. But, paradoxically, they also saw the performance as a contemporary political allegory of exploitation, empathising with the demon victims than with the gods. In the same theatre, a spectacular ""Panchali Sapatham"" centre-staged the game of dice where the Pandavas lose everything to the Kauravas, including their queen. To the poet Subramania Bharati this was a chilling parable of India enslaved by the British. But to the viewers of today the episode became a gut-wrenching metaphor of their nation, and indeed the world, preyed by greed, megalomania and hatred.

The classical arts deploy metaphors and images, not slogans. Chennai’s Margazhi Utsavam indicates how some artists strive to employ those subtle tools to trigger an awareness of contemporary social problems and ethical dilemmas, to turn performance into a process of healing. They know that audiences are looking for art that lives and breathes in its time, not museumised spectacles. Aptly, Srinidhi Chidambaram’s Bharatanatyam recital ended with a ‘mangalam’ finale asking why faiths abandon love for oppression, and why hearts cannot co-exist in harmony as flowers do.

KANNUR: An inmate died and 22 others have been hospitalized following food poisoning at a destitute home near Oduvally in the interiors of Thaliparamba in the district on Tuesday.

According to officials, the deceased has been identified as Gundu Rao from Andhra, who had been staying at Divya Karunya Ashram , Chundakkunnu, near Oduvally. This is a rehabilitation centre for psychiatric patients, wandering beggars and disabled people.

The inmates suffered food poisoning apparently after they consumed ghee rice, chicken curry and salad, supplied for lunch as part of an old students’ meet of higher secondary school in Naduvil on December 29. Though the food was part of the noon meal, they showed symptoms when they consumed it in the evening too. There are 24 inmates, and one inmate who did not consume this food had nosymptoms.

All the 22 infected people have been admitted to Govt Medical College, Pariyaram, while the body of the deceased has been kept in mortuary, as the family could not be traced.

A joint team from the health and food safety departments visited the place and collected samples for examination.

DMO K Narayana Nayak said they would send the samples for testing to know the cause of poisoning. “In the preliminary enquiry, we found that when they consumed the food in the afternoon they did not have any problem but when they consumed it in the night as well, they suffered the symptoms,” he said.

Police said a case of unnatural death has been registered.

AGRA: Days after a senior police official of Agra range claimed that no bullet was fired during the anti-CAA protest in Firozabad on December 20, at least four videos have emerged in which police are not only shown purportedly firing at the protesting mob, but also helped by unidentified civilians, who are seen throwing stones from their side. In another video, a mob is seen setting to fire a shop in the presence of police force.The authenticity of the videos could be not confirmed.Six people were killed with bullet injuries in the anti-CAA protest on December 20. Inspector General (Agra range) Satish Ganesh, however, had claimed that that not a single bullet was fired by police during the violence. On Tuesday, when TOI shared the four videos with the IG for his reaction, he said: “I will ask Firozabad SP to look into them.”In the first video accessed by TOI, a group of 15-20 civilians along with cops are seen barging inside a wooden shop (Raja ki Lakdi ki Taal) owned by one Raja Khan. The men throw stones, vandalised shop and later set ablaze woods kept inside the shop. It's located on Shikohabad Adda Road at Vakeelpura Mandi, close to Nalband Chouraha under Rasoolpur police jurisdiction. Firozabad police claims that this is the place where violence started on December 20.In the second video, the same group of civilians are found throwing stones towards Phoolwali gully dominated by Muslims while police stand behind civilians. Moments later, cops are seen firing from their assault rifles.Speaking with TOI, Azad Khan (42), the elder brother of Raja Khan, said, “I along with my nephew Faraz Khan (19) alias Deepu, and other employees Gulshan Sharma (19) and Mohammad Israr were selling woods, when we saw heavy police force and group of civilians running towards Nalband Chouraha from Rasoolpur thana. Sensing something unusual and threatful, I immediately asked all my customers to return home.” Azad suffered multiple injuries after been assaulted by civilians and cops inside his wooden shop.“We immediately shut our shop's door. My staff and a few other customers hid themselves behind stack of woods, while my nephew and I were in our office watching the group of civilians and policemen through our seven CCTVs cameras. We saw civilians vandalising two-wheelers and other vehicles parked outside the shop while policemen remained unmoved. Later, two policemen came toward our shop and broke our shop's door, helping unruly civilians to barge inside. Both police and group of civilians threw stones at our shop, destroyed our CCTV cameras, took away CCTV DVR from our office which had footage of vandalism,"" claimed Azad.The mob set our woods on fire while police kept looking at them. They dragged me, my nephew and staff out of the shop and brutally assaulted us. I begged police to let me douse the fire, but they didn’t allow. I somehow escaped and jumped off the shop’s rear wall to save myself, while my nephew Faraz, employee Gulshan Sharma and a customer identified as Adil were taken to police station,” he added.While Gulshan has been released, Adil is in jail and has been issued property seizure notice by Firozabad district administration. His father, Saeed, told TOI: “Adil was returning after offering Friday’s prayers when he had to take refuge in a wooden shop along with some other men since there was violence on streets. He was on the phone with me when some people dragged him out. I heard him shout for help. His phone has been switched off since.""Azad told TOI that Gulshan was released by police on December 21 morning after his parents showed his identification card to police. ""We had nothing to do with violence and were engaged in our usual business. My nephew Faraz was born on Diwali day, therefore we kept Deepu as his nickname and is now known by his Hindu name instead of Faraz.”Talking to TOI, Gulshan Sharma said, “We were selling woods to customers, when police and violent mob barged inside the shop and brutally attacked us. They took me and others to police station and only after confirming my identity, police released me.

TRICHY: The state might have declared holiday for colleges until Wednesday, but students in colleges affiliated to Bharathidasan University had to appear for their semester examination on Tuesday after their test dates unusually clashed with that of holidays.

Students had to attend examinations on December 23, 24, and 26 even though higher education secretary Mangat Ram Sharma issuing direction to university/colleges to remain closed on these days. He made the announcement on December 20, asking institutions to compensate the holidays by opening on Saturdays and other holidays.

The university had scheduled examination on these days much earlier to the announcement made by the higher education secretary and university chose to go ahead with semester examinations on these days. A faculty from city college said that the university should have postponed semester examinations considering hardship to students. “Especially for outstation students as hostels were closed in many colleges and students had to come only to write examinations,” said the faculty.

Higher education secretary, in his letter, had not mentioned anywhere that examinations should not be conducted on these dates. Instruction was to declare holiday on these four days,” said controller of examination (COE) BDU K Duraiarasan.“We had rescheduled semester examinations originally scheduled for December 27 and 30 as local body polls were to happen on these days and outstation students had to go to their hometowns. Postponing examination on these days would have affected working days on the upcoming semester especially when the working days are less, he said.

166,['1/01/2020'],Cheetah squads to hit roads today,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The all new Cheetah Patrol Squad of the city traffic police and the new traffic sector system introduced to ease the traffic regulation duties of the police and thereby reduce the traffic woes of the city motorists will officially start functioning from Wednesday, the New Year day.

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan will flag off the new systems during the occasion of the inauguration of the new building of Thampanoor police station in the city.

The city police first initiated works to revise the traffic sectors in the city in a way ensuring presence of more police personnel on roads for traffic regulation.

A traffic sector is like an area under a local police station with an officer in the rank of a sub-inspector in charge of it. Earlier, the city had 11 sectors, five under north traffic subdivision and six under south traffic subdivision. Under the new system, the number of sectors was raised to 30, with 14 under north sub-division and 16 under south sub-division. This was done by reducing the size of the sectors that existed before.

A month ago, the idea of Cheetah Patrol Squad was also mooted in a meeting convened by state police chief Loknath Behera in which the city residents had the opportunity to submit their complaints and suggestions regarding city traffic directly to the DGP.

There will be 10 Cheetah patrolling teams in the city and each team will be provided with a four-wheeler for patrolling purposes. Each Cheetah Patrol Squad will consist of a sub-inspector, a driver and a civil police officer.

The sub-inspector of the Cheetah Patrolling Squad will act as a ‘station house officer on wheels’, who will have the authority to receive complaints, register cases, regulate traffic, attend to accident victims and even initiate steps to recover vehicles that are parked in an obstructive way.

There will be 10 Cheetah Patrol Squads in total, five each under the north and south traffic sub-divisions. These squads will be attached to various local police stations in the city. However, with the stations as the base of their operations, each Cheetah Patrol Squad will be led by a sub-inspector who will also have three or four traffic sectors under their control, based on proximity.

Cheetah patrolling units will be always be vigilant and responsive to perform any operations given to them either through wireless set or mobile phone. They will immediately reach the spot where any traffic-related issue happens and will take necessary actions accordingly.

They will hand over the offender (accused) to the concerned police station under the jurisdictional limit, with a written report of the offence committed by the accused and will also take immediate steps to transfer the victims to the nearby hospital.

168,['1/01/2020'],G’chiroli cops moot amnesty plan for youths who joined Maoist camps,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Nagpur: Gadchiroli police have decided to initiate no legal proceedings against the youths for joining the Maoists as their recruits despite their names being mentioned as supporters in records.

The decision has been taken based on the assumption that the youths may have joined the camps fearing consequences of refusing the rebels.

Around 12 youths from Nelgonda and its adjoining hamlets had joined the Maoists’ training camp at Abhujamadh, a stronghold of the rebels stretching across the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh borders, which was subsequently stormed by C-60 commandos on November 30, 2019. Two persons, who police claimed were rebels, were neutralized at the camp site where arrangements of physical exercises and arms training were found.

It’s learnt that around eight supporters out of 12 have returned home after the camp site was busted by the elite commando group of the Gadchiroli police. Despite knowing their names and the fact about their presence at the camp, police have decided not to invoke any penal provisions against them.

Sources said the decision to show leniency will continue for supporters and members of the militia unless their active involvement in the sabotage comes to fore.

SP Shailesh Balkawade said no action would be initiated against the 12 youths who had gone to participate in the training camp. “Eight have come back but we will write to the families of the rest of the four youths. No action would be initiated against them provided they return promptly without being involved more in the movement,” he said.

“We have dealt humanely with the persons who have returned so far and waiting for the others to come back. In fact, we will go a step ahead and try to find out whether they can be helped with some employment,” said the SP.

Balkawade said the district police have decided to overlook help offered to the Maoists by the villagers, like giving food and other supplies. “We can understand that the villagers deliver food and ration supplies to the Maoists fearing consequences of refusal. Police will not spare those supplying logistical support to the Maoists to trigger blasts and other such activities,” he said.

Citing an example, Balkawade said police had not initiated any action on bulk of the residents of Lavheri village of Kurkheda taluka, who knew about the Jambhulkheda blast or supported in executing the act leading to death of 15 jawans of Quick Response Team (QRT) and one civilian driver on May 1, 2019.

“Police had arrested only six persons who then had actively helped the Maoists to carry out the blast,” he said.

Balkawade claimed that police are now fast gaining grounds among the masses of the Gadchiroli replacing Maoist influence at most of the places in the district where the rebels earlier enjoyed deeper support.

Jaipur: Rajasthan, which ranks 15 in terms of recorded forest area (RFA) in the country, is a forest deficient state according to India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2019.

Although the state’s forest cover has seen marginal increase of 57.51 sq-km as compared to 2017, the moderate forest cover area and open forest cover area have declined in the last two years.

Acccording to the report, while very dense forest (VDF) area remained unchanged from 2017 with 78sq-km, the moderately dense forest (MDF) reduced from 4340 sq-km in 2017 to 4309 in 2019. Also, the open forest area which was 12,154 sq-km two years ago, now stands at 11,708 sq-km.

IFSR mentioned that reasons for this increase were plantation and conservation activities as well as improvement in interpretation. The report reads, “In the last two years, the state raised a total of 42,633 ha of plantation. Also, the state has examples of some of the best afforestation practices along the Indira Gandhi Canal. Under the Joint Forest Management, there are 6,377 village forest management committees and eco-development committees operational in the state.”

In Rajasthan, RFA is 32,737 sq-km out of which 12,475 sq-km is reserved forest, 18,217 sq-km is protected forest and 2,045 sq-km is unclassed forests. The state has five national parks, 25 wildlife sanctuaries and 11 conservation reserves which constitute the Protected Area network of the state covering 2.92% of its geographical area. There are three Project Tiger (Ranthambhore, Sariska and Mukundra Hills) and two Ramsar (Keoladeo Ghana sanctuary and Sambhar lake) sites.

The report also highlighted an alarming fact that despite increase in forest cover, tree cover of the state had decreased by 154 sq-km as compared to the previous assessment reported in ISFR 2017. Tree cover in Rajasthan is estimated as 8112 sq-km as mentioned in the report. The report also pointed out in Rajasthan, between January 1, 2015 to February 5, 2019, a total of 2,834 hectares of forest land was diverted for non-forestry purposes under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 (MoEF & CC, 2019).

DEHRADUN: A fire broke out in the room of the personal secretary of Additional Secretary (Law) at the secretariat building here on Tuesday. According to the fire department officials, the fire was presumably caused due to a short circuit which destroyed the stabiliser and central processing unit of the computer, some papers, and curtains in the room.

The fire brigade reached the spot in around half-an-hour after the secretariat staff found smoke coming out of Sanjay Kumar’s room. Kumar is the personal secretary of Sayan Singh Negi, Additional Secretary (Law). Fortunately, no human injury was reported in the incident.

“The flame was quickly doused by fire extinguishers. The staff also managed to save important files but the blaze caught the computer’s CPU,” said Diwakar Kumar, who works in fire brigade control room. He added that the exact cause of fire would be ascertained following proper investigation.

Earlier in February, 2019, a fire had broken out on the fourth floor of the state secretariat building where the chief minister’s office is situated.

PANAJI: The implementation of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, which was scheduled for January, will be discussed at the upcoming cabinet meet, following which the legislation will be enforced.

“The state government has decided that the matter will go to the cabinet. The law department wanted it to be discussed as it is a major policy decision. The matter will go for discussion and a decision will be taken at the cabinet meet scheduled to be held in January,” transport director Rajan Satardekar, said.

He added that the act is likely to be implemented by the end of the month.

The new legislation came into force across the country from September 1 onwards. However, after some state governments raised concerns regarding some of the hiked fines, they were permitted to impose lower penalties for certain traffic violations. Taking a cue, the Goa government also decided to reduce the penalties for some offences and the enforcement of the new MV (Amendment) Act was consequently postponed to January.

“There is no scope for us to reduce fines for violations like drunk driving or driving without a licence. Fines for other offences like helmetless riding, wrong parking etc can be reduced,” transport minister Mauvin Godinho has said.

He had earlier also announced that the government would first repair pothole-ridden roads in Goa before implementing the act and charging steep fines.

Satardekar said the issue of reduction of fines for certain traffic violations will be decided by the cabinet this month, too.

TRICHY: Warning passengers of offenders in trains, Trichy division railway police superintendent T Senthilkumar urged the people to use helpline 1,512 in the event of emergencies, here on Tuesday.

“Though the helpline is functioning for the past two years, it is the time to remind the people of using it fully for their safety on board the trains. This helpline can be used to report on teasing of women, movement of suspicious people. The response will be quick that the government railway police will be on spot for their help,” Senthilkumar said here on Tuesday.

As many as 700 police personnel have been deployed across the 28 stations in division covering 18 districts from Villpuram to Kanyakumari to ensure the safety of the passengers on the eve of New Year. “With 120 trains crossing Trichy every day ferrying over two lakh passengers, government railway police, railway protection force and other staff carry out open line patrol, platform patrol and onboard train patrol,” he said.

The intensified security has been put in place in the railway stations in pilgrim centres such as Rameswaram, Palani, Velankanni, Vellore , Thanjavur , Kumbakonam and few other places.

SP Senthilkumar listed out the cases cracked in 2019. GRP arrested 53 bag-lifters and recovered 150 sovereigns of gold ornaments stolen from the railway passengers. In the cell phone theft case, GRP arrested 94 accused and seized 254 out of 335 mobile phones this year.

GRP rescued 827 children from railway stations in Trichy railway division. “The rescued children included missing children and runaway children. Of the rescued children, 809 children were handed over to their parents. The parents of the rest of them are yet to be traced. So, they are kept in the care and protection home,” he said.

On the deaths on the track, SP blamed the careless trespassing of people on the railway track several times. “While suicide on the railway tracks are also a cause of concern, many cases of deaths on the track occurred as the passengers trespass the track listening songs on the headphone and also for relieving themselves. It should be avoided,” he said.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may soon announce its chief minister’s candidate for the upcoming assembly election in Delhi. Sources said the party had initially decided to name its chief minister candidate in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally but delayed the announcement .

The internal surveys conducted by the saffron party have suggested that the electorate may like to know who the chief minister of Delhi would be if BJP is elected to power.

A senior BJP functionary said that top leadership appeared positive to the suggestion and the possible announcement may be made by BJP national president Amit Shah during the booth-level workers’ meet on Sunday. “The elections, however, will be fought under the leadership of Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari.”

“The office-bearers of the local party unit and the members of the core group for the assembly polls have been indicated in recent meetings that a decision on CM candidate may be taken soon,” said a core committee member of Delhi BJP.

BJP has fought all previous assembly polls in the national capital with a CM face. The ruling AAP has been regularly challenging the saffron party to name the candidate who would be taking on chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in the upcoming assembly election.

A section of BJP functionaries had earlier suggested the central leadership that the elections may be fought in the name of PM Modi to prevent any dissent, said sources. “We have seen in previous elections how naming a chief ministerial candidate did not go down too well with some Delhi leaders. A section believed that any such decision may have an adverse impact on the party’s prospects,” said a senior party functionary.

Another party functionary said the decision to name the chief ministerial candidate was strengthened following the recent defeat in Jharkhand.

DEHRADUN: The divisional forest officer (DFO) of Terai (East) suspended a forest inspector (FI) on Tuesday after a purported audio clip of the forester allegedly seeking bribe from a man believed to be from the sand mining mafia went viral on social media. Both the forest department and Haldwani police have initiated an inquiry into the matter.

Terai (East) DFO Nitishmani Tripathi said that the action against the forester, Kailash Chandra Kapil was taken based on a purported audio clip in which he is allegedly seeking money for allowing sand mining in Kumaon. “We contacted the forest inspector who told us that someone is conspiring against him and it’s not his voice. He also told us that he had lodged a police complaint in the matter. However, prima facie, it’s his voice and I have suspended him with immediate effect,” Tripathi added.

According to sources in the forest department, the accused, in the initial investigation, maintained that he received an extortion call from an unknown number and the caller threatened to circulate a fake audio if he failed to pay money. However, during preliminary inquiry, several colleagues of the accused confirmed that the voice was that of Kapil.

Tripathi said, “We have started an inquiry in the matter and a separate investigation is also being done by district police. Suitable action will be taken against him if he is found guilty. His suspension has been done to send out a message that corruption will cost officials their job.”

Nagpur: Biding adieu to 2019, city police commissioner BK Upadhyay on Tuesday said women’s security will be one of the top two priorities in the New Year. The other key focus area would be police welfare.

After seeing off the hotly contested general and state elections in 2019 without any hiccups, Upadhyay ended the year with a popular decision of starting home-drop scheme for women in the backdrop of the Hyderabad rape and murder case.

As per the scheme, women would get help to reach home in police vehicles in case they are stranded without any transportation at any place between 9pm and 5am.

Upadhyay is set to be felicitated along with Jt CP Ravindra Kadam and Nagpur police by an NGO on January 3 for successfully commencing the plan and his other women-oriented policing measures.

Statistically, Upadhyay and his team had a better 2019 than the year before. In 2018, there were 166 cases of rape, while the number came marginally down to 161 till December end. There number of molestation cases in 2019 (338) was also less as compared to the previous year (378) till December 30. All the offences have been detected.

Apart from the home-drop scheme, Upadhyay is contemplating to strengthen the existing ‘Damini squad’ which helps women in distress, especially in public places. The top cop nurtured a liberal policy towards registering complaints lodged by women by issuing instructions to the police stations that such cases should not be soft-peddled.

“(In 2020) We will open a school for police families at the headquarters. Initially, the school would be for students between Std I and IV. Later, we have an expansion plan in the pipeline,” he said.

In the past, for CP Satya Pal Singh, now an MP, had started a school but it had to be rolled back due to want of permission.

In 2019, Upadhyay said his focus area was ‘organized crime’. Around 13 gangs were slapped with charges under the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA) while 44 goons were put behind bars charged with Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) Act.

Though murder cases have gone up by six in 2019 in comparison to 2018, police records showed that 39 of them were due to domestic dispute and not involving goons. Robbery cases have come down by 40 while burglaries were 54 less in 2019 than the year before. There were lesser cases of dacoities in 2019 (15) than in 2018 (25). Also, motor vehicle thefts cases have come down by 54.

After arresting gangster Santosh Ambekar , Upadhyay and Kadam’s collaborative efforts witnessed registration of 12 offences against him including invoking the fifth MCOCA against him within two months.

The firing on city’s first citizen, mayor Sandip Joshi, during the winter assembly session might have been a setback for Upadhyay, but the top cop sounded confident about cracking the case soon. “Whatever is the motive and whoever may be behind the incident, we will place the facts before the citizens soon. We have not taken the question on police’s ability lightly,” he added.

MP chief minister Kamal Nath , while extending ‘New Year' to the citizens of Madhya Pradesh, urged them to learn from failures of the past and respect time. In his latest blog, Nath said failures were nothing but the outcome of efforts made half-heartedly and people who cultivated friendship with time, reached their desired destinations and comfortably achieved their targeted goals.

""Let us welcome the dawn of 2020 with countless hopes, enthusiasm and positive energies . The year 2019 has gone down the memory lanes. Always be ready to learn from failures and note that failures are nothing but the outcome of efforts made halfheartedly. Always think that success is relative. Despite sincere efforts, it may be elusive. So, always be in pursuit of excellence. I just recall a couplet from classical Urdu poetry in which great poet Hali says- ""Hai Justaju Ki Khoob Se Hai Khoobtar Kahan? Ab Thaharti Hai Dekhiye Jaa Kar Nazar Kahan?"" said Nath.

Emphasising on learning from the failures, he said, “Don't be scared of failures and never be charmed by successes as they are not permanent. We fail only when we fail to keep pace with the changing Time, which is merciless. It never stops for anyone regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical identities. This is the only precious thing, which everybody has but a few have the requisite wisdom to utilise it."" ""I recall the title of a famous painting of extremely talented Russian Jewish painter Marc Chagall which reads that ‘Time Is A River Without Bank'. So, if we want Time to flow in the desired direction, we have to embank the River of Time and this is the challenge all of us have to take up. No one can help us in this pursuit,"" said Nath.

Nath also suggested to respect time and said, ""There are certain things, which we can't purchase despite all our wealth like love, affection, knowledge, trust, sleep, smile, health, friendship and of course the powerful time.

We perish every moment if we waste it. In the New Year, take a resolve to be sensitive about the use of time. Respect every moment and keep learning to manage the time.""

AGRA: The India State of Forest Report 2019 has revealed that over the last two years, forest cover has shrunk in the eco-sensitive Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ).The TTZ is a 10,400 sq km trapezium-shaped area covering five districts of Agra, Firozabad, Mathura, Hathras and Etah in UP and Bharatpur district of Rajasthan. The zone comprises over 40 protected monuments, including three World Heritage sites -- Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri.As compared to the 2017 Forest Survey of India (FSI) report, the forest cover in the six districts has reduced from 3.47% to 3.43% of geographical area in 2019. In 2017, the forest cover in TTZ was 664 km which has shrunk to 657.71 in 2019.In Agra district , the forest cover has reduced by 9.38 sq km over the last two years.The report comes four years after the Supreme Court had rapped the UP government for making false claims on planting planting of saplings in the TTZ to protect the Taj Mahal from pollution after a two-member panel had submitted a report, saying that the state government’s claim of having planted 15,000 saplings around the World Heritage site was false.The apex court had ordered the state government to plant over 2.58 lakh saplings in 790 hectares.Reacting to the report, divisional commissioner Anil Kumar, who is also the chairman of TTZ, said, “We are working on increasing the green cover in the TTZ area. Lakhs of saplings have been planted in each of the districts over the past two years. They will develop into trees in next few years, significantly increasing the forest cover. After studying the FSI report, suitable action will be taken in a time-bound manner.”According to the FSI report, in Mathura district, forest cover has shrunk to 1.71 km and by 4.82 km in Etah district. In Hathras, no change has been recorded in the forest cover. However, the forest cover has increased by 9.60 km in Firozabad district and by 1.27 km in Bharatpur district.District forest officer Manish Mittal said, “We are studying the report. There seems to be some change in the methodology in evaluating the forest cover. The reasons behind the decline in forest cover will be identified soon. This year, 28 lakh saplings have been planted in the district. Last year, around 18 lakh trees were planted. Agra district is going to see a major increase in forest cover over the next 4-5 years.”Senior lawyer and secretary of city-based social organization, Agra Development Foundation (ADF), KC Jain said, “It is upsetting that forest cover has reduced in the area declared as eco-sensitive zone by the apex court. A special committee of experts from the FSI, Dehradun, National Botanical Research Institute in Lucknow and Dayalbagh Educational Institute in Agra should be constituted to suggest ways to increase the forest cover in the TTZ.”",agra,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73054871,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-468438,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/forest-cover-shrinks-in-eco-sensitive-taj-trapezium-zone/articleshow/73050763.cms

Foreign tourists enjoy their day in Jaipur city (File photo)

JAIPUR: The ongoing unrest over CAA and NRC has taken a hit on number of foreign tourists visiting Rajasthan in winter.

Tourist destinations like Pushkar, Udaipur , Jodhpur and Jaipur have seen fewer foreigners than previous years in the last two week of December. The hospitality sector started receiving cancellations and seen a dip in bookings by foreign nationals after advisories issued by some countries in the wake of rape cases and abrogation of Article 370.

It further aggravated after the CAA protest started. Jaisalmer, however, seemed to be an exception which has seen a good turnout of foreigners.

Piyush Sharma, a marketing manager at a four-star hotel in Jaipur, said Rajasthan may have not seen any major violent protests or demonstration, but was still facing the brunt. “Arrival of foreign tourists depends on political and social stability along with law and order situation of host country,” said Sharma. The latest entrant in world tourist map Sawai Madhopur is also feeling the heat due to dwindling number of foreign tourists.

Thiruvananthapuram: Museum-Zoo department has bagged the first prize in the flower show competition held at the Kanakakkunnu Palace as a part of Vasantholsavam 2019.

The team led by G R Rajagopal exhibited 1,700 plant species in the nine-day flower exhibition, which in turn brought the first prize back to the Museum-Zoo team after 17 long years.

“We exhibited 1,700 different plant species, which is a new record. All teams which participated in this competition faced adverse climatic conditions. We found it hard to ensure that the flowers bloomed as we received very less amount of sunlight. But it was the determination, perseverance and hard-work of our employees, including the daily-wage staff, which helped us win this competition,” said S Abu, director of department of museums and zoos.

The Museum-Zoo team contested in 57 categories out of 70 and bagged 23 first prizes, 13 second prizes and 9 third prizes. They edged ahead of the Kerala secretariat team by four points, thereby winning the overall category with 421 points.

“The meticulous planning and professional approach of our team members made this victory possible. Last year, when we finished second, we honoured our team members by presenting them with plaques at a special celebratory function. This year we will be conducting a bigger celebratory function to honour each and every member of our team for making this possible,” said Abu. He also added that the Museum- Zoo team will be participating in next year’s competition by exhibiting more than two thousand plants.

189,['1/01/2020'],Activists send fresh set of proposals to remove encroachments on NH-16,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Visakhapatnam: A section of social activists in the city have sent a fresh set of proposals to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) to remove illegal encroachments on both sides of the stretch of National Highway (NH)-16 passing through the city.

Activists claim that if the government’s proposal to make Vizag city the executive capital of the state materialises, the number of vehicles on city roads will increase manifold, worsening the commute on the NH-16 .

“Even the present condition of the NH16 is very bad. Traffic hardly moves during peak hours. At some of the crossings, the wait at traffic signals seems to be timeless,” said Tenneti Narasimham, a social activist who has long advocated to remove encroachments on the stretch.

In June 2019, TOI had reported that the average speed of vehicles on the NH-16 was around 25 km/hour to 30 km/hour.

“The only way to sort out this issue is to increase the breadth of the highway and build service roads all along the stretch that passes through the city. We are now planning to take up the issue with the chief minister,” added Narasimham.

In June NHAI, Visakhapatnam prepared a report that stated there were no less than 227 encroachments on a mere 6-km-stretch from Zoo Park to Maddilapalem crossing.

The report stated that around 208 encroachments are permanent in nature and include popular bars, restaurants, bakeries, automobiles and garment shops.

“In our reports we have included the names of the owners of the stores, whether these stores are permanent or temporary in nature and in what capacity they have encroached upon the highway. The GVMC is the authority to take legal steps against these encroachers,” said an NHAI official.

GVMC officials claimed that driving away encroachers overnight is difficult given the permanent nature of the encroachments. Several encroachers have been operating business for years.

“It is very difficult to drive them away. We have to wait for the government’s position on this and will act if Visakhapatnam is announced the executive capital,” said a senior GVMC official.

192,['1/01/2020'],Payment of gratuity is a matter of right: Gujarat HC,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Representative image

RAJKOT: The Gujarat high court upholding the order of single judge ordering Upleta municipality in Rajkot district to pay gratuity amount to the petitioner who retired in 2012 when he was under suspension. A division bench led by Justice S R Brahmbhatt ruled that any curtailment in his gratuity has to be done on the basis of applicable law.

Arjan Vadhia joined as a store keeper and retired as a tax inspector in Upleta municipal. He had to fight an eight-year-long legal battle after his retirement on March 31, 2012 after he was placed under suspension during retirement and the municipality had withheld his gratuity amount of Rs 4.24 lakh citing municipality recruitment rules as well as conditions of service of employees rules-1989.

Arjan approached the controlling authority in Rajkot in October 2013 which ordered the municipality to pay the full amount with 10 percent interest. The municipality then approached the appellate authority challenging the order which reduced the amount of gratuity to Rs 2.97 lakh on the grounds that the petitioner was under suspension in the last few months of his service and that he was paid subsistence allowance.

Vadhiya challenged this order before the HC where single judge bench ordered in his favor and quashed the order of appellate authority. The municipality challenged the single judge before a division bench of high court.

Upholding the order, HC noted that “The payment of gratuity , as said by the Supreme court, is a matter of right and any curtailment thereof needs to be on the basis of applicable law.”

Petitioner’s advocate Mehul Mehta said, “The division bench also ruled that the subsistence allowance can’t be said as wage and rejected considering the allowance amount to calculate Arjan’s gratuity.”

NEW DELHI: Getting a power connection in the city’s non-electrified areas will be cheaper with Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) notifying uniform service line development charges throughout Delhi.

DERC has made the service line development (SLD) charges same in both non-electrified and electrified areas, a Delhi government release stated on Tuesday. The difference of SLD charges collected between September 1, 2017 and December 30, 2019 will be adjusted in the ensuing electricity bills, the release added.

According to a power department official, the charges for a new connection at the non-electrified areas was higher compared to the electrified areas. “Now it’s Rs 3,000 for up to a 5kW connection everywhere,” he said, adding that only a few areas in Delhi, especially in the outer areas, might be without power.

As per the government release, DERC has got two new members. They are Ashok Kumar Singhal, a former additional chief adviser cost, and head of Indian Cost Account Service in the Union finance ministry’s expenditure department, and Akhilesh Kumar Ambasht, a former Indian Forest Services officer.

NFIW general secretary Annie Raja in the city on Tuesday

JAIPUR: The National Federation of India Women (NFIW) has urged all civil society groups to stand together against CAA and NRC protests.

Reacting on the split between Yogendra Yadav, who is leading 100 civil society groups, and the CPI affiliated bodies, NFIW general secretary Annie Raja said those who were against the draconian laws must stand united. “It’s time for all those individuals and groups who are taking a stand against the NRC and CAA to unitedly fight against the evil designs of the government. We should bury our differences and stand together,” said Raja in Jaipur on Tuesday. The bodies affiliated with the CPI has raised objections over Yadav’s statement for including some groups they consider as non-liberals.

The women activists had gathered in Jaipur for the 21st NIWF national meet ‘Asserting Constitutional Values Towards Gender Equality, Communal Harmony and Non-Violence.”

Raje termed the non-stop women protest at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi a watershed moment which will script a new movement in India.

“Hundreds of women braving chilly conditions are protesting 24/7 from the past 10-12 days against the CAA,” said Raja. Nisha Siddu of NIWF talked about the anti-women stand of the Modi government since 2014. “Our women have suffered the most during the demonetisation. It has rendered them without work or taken away all the limited opportunities they had. Even in the new education policy, the strict exam system will obstruct women from taking up higher education,” said Siddu.

A 17th century stone inscription and a sculpture has been discovered near Trichy

TRICHY: A sculpture and stone inscription dating back to CE 17th century have been discovered near Trichy, shedding light on construction of a weir during the rule of a local feudatory.

P Loganathan, an enthusiast in history, spotted the inscription near a dried-up pond at Velur in the Kilthottiyappatti - Thennalur road near Viralimalai . Terming it a significant discovery, R Kalaikkovan, director, Dr M Rajamanikkanar Centre for Historical Research, Trichy, said that a sculpture for first time is found with a notification of the construction of a weir in Trichy district along with a sculpture depicting a male announcing the same.

The 16-line record is in Tamil script and gives the date as Tamil month Ani 22, 1698 CE. It registers the construction of the weir during the rule of the local feudatory Chinnakar Mada Srinayakkarayyan when Manisarayappillai of Thiruvanaikkavan was the head man of the village (Maniyam).

A pond with well-raised bunds has stone and stucco mixed walls of 2.40 metres height on its south embracing the weir with three projecting stones on each side to denote the water level. R Akila, assistant professor, department of history, Arignar Anna Government Arts College, Musiri, and M Nalini, head, department of history, Seethalakshimi Ramasamy College, Trichy, visited the site on receiving information and examined the inscription. “The granite sculpture that stands on the platform is inserted in such a way that the wall be in the centre with a caved edge to facilitate surplus water to flow through,” said Akila.

TIRUPUR: Parveen Fatima of Kargil in Ladakh had no idea that she had spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi when she got a call on her mobile enquiring about her career progress after she was trained and placed in a job under Himayat, a scheme implemented by the Union rural development ministry.

Fatima, who works as a supervisor-cum-coordinator in a private apparel manufacturing unit at Nochipalayam in Tirupur, said she came to know it was the PM who called only when Modi mentioned the conversation in the Mann Ki Baat programme on All India Radio.

“I was in my native place when I received a call on my mobile phone. The person at the other end queried about my job and encouraged me to continue it. The call lasted only under a minute. Later, the authorities at the Kargil Himayat Center, where I took the training on apparel tailoring and basics, informed me that the PM was pleased with my progress,” the 24-year-old woman told TOI.

“I was overwhelmed and my family and relatives were very happy. Even the local press poured in and interviewed me.”

Fatima was among 90 women from Kargil - aged between 18 and 28 - who were placed in one of the apparel units of SCM Garments Private Limited under the Himayat scheme, an exclusive scheme for the then unified Jammu and Kashmir launched eight years ago.

The private company has allocated a section of tailoring machines exclusively for the Ladakhi women. The company has provided them accommodation, and brought a cook from Ladakh to prepare food for them in the hostel as the women had requested it. Even transportation is separate for the women, to travel between their hostel and the unit.

“Usually, our families are reluctant to allow women to go out of Ladakh. Even though the women completed the training for tailoring under the Himayat programme, our parents were hesitating to allow us to work outside Ladakh. They allowed us to come to Tirupur only after the Himayat Center authorities arranged a meeting and convinced them about our safety,” Fatima said.

In a short stint of six months, SCM Garments promoted Fatima as supervisor-cum-coordinator for the stitching section of those Ladakh women. “It feels great that I grabbed the skills quickly from trainers in the company, and I was selected to lead our women,” she added.

She had wanted to choose a career in fashion designing as she had grown watching traditional embroidery in Jammu and Kashmir. “When I revealed my dream, a well-wisher advised me to take training under the Himayat scheme to know about the basics of apparel making. Moreover, I wanted to travel to other places in the country and to get good exposure. So, I chose to work in Tirupur,” Fatima said.

Fatima has three siblings. Her father Sabeer Hussain, a daily wager, struggled to get work, especially during the winter season. “My income is the major source for running our family,” she said.

A manager of the apparel unit said, “The stitching section run by the Ladakh women is having almost 50% lesser efficiency in production than the section handled by local people. But our aim is to motivate them to compete with the skilled employees.”

M Arul Saravanan, chief marketing officer of SCM garments, told TOI, “We were the first company in Tirupur to recruit people trained under the Himayat scheme in Ladakh. We have been actively recruiting trained tailors under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) scheme, under which the Himayat comes, across the country. We plan to recruit 500 more trained people from Ladakh and J&K.”

Ahmad Nabi

AGRA: Even after 12 days, Firozabad jail administration has not been able to take stage-2 cancer patient Ahmad Nabi, who suffered multiple fractures in alleged police action during the December 20 anti-CAA stir violence, to district hospital due to lack of personnel for police escort.

On December 24, a special court judge had ordered the district administration to provide all possible medical assistance to Nabi who suffered multiple fractures during the alleged police action.

Firozabad jailor Lal Pratap Singh said, “We had written to Firozabad Police Line reserve inspector (RI) for personnel to escort Nabi, but he failed to provide any. Nabi had to undergo surgery for his fractures, though our jail medical staff had provided him temporary plaster. He is currently in medical ward of jail.”

Speaking with TOI, RI Ram Singh of Firozabad Police Line said, “On Wednesday, we will provide escort for Nabi.”

Meanwhile, a district hospital doctor said, “Nabi was supposed to be admitted here on Tuesday for a medical check-up before the operation for his fractures, which was scheduled for Wednesday, but police failed to bring him here. Earlier on Saturday, he was brought to the hospital but was not admitted by the cops.”

Dr R K Pandey, chief medical superintendent of district hospital, had told TOI, that “due to dispute between jail staff and police escort, Nabi was not admitted in hospital”.

Sources claimed that police were ordered to take Nabi to the out-patient department (OPD) but they were not briefed about his admission for surgery.

“The jail staff asked police escort to admit Nabi in the hospital, but they said no,” said Vakeel Nabi, younger brother of Ahmad Nabi who was present at the district hospital when Ahmad Nabi was being taken into the doctor’s chamber.

“My brother’s both legs are fractured and he has also suffered severe injury in his left arm during police action on December 20. Ahmad was returning home when he was picked by police and assaulted,” alleged Vakeel Nabi.

Ahmad Nabi runs a crockery store in Hajipura area of Rasoolpur police jurisdiction where violence had occurred on December 20.

Thiruvananthapuram: This New Year, the city zoo has got a slithery, colourful exhibit. Banded krait , a slow moving, long, venomous snake, which is not found in Kerala was brought to city zoo on Tuesday.

The snake was captured by Vava Suresh at Malayinkeezhu, which was later handed over to department of forests. On Tuesday the zoo authorities housed the krait in a special enclosure.

“The zoo had housed kraits before. It is a very beautiful snake and adults can attain length up to 59 inches. What we have here is an adult. As soon as we got the snake into the enclosure, it coiled inside the bamboo tree sweeping the dry leaves in the shape of a nest,” said S Abu, director, museum and zoo.

Banded krait is usually found in states like Bengal, Odisha, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. Rescue of the snake in the district has puzzled authorities as it is not migratory by nature. The officials said that it may have been reared or been smuggled furtively. The zoo already has a rich display of reptiles like reticulated python , green anaconda and king cobra.

Banded krait has a high contrast yellow and black colour and it feeds on rats and smaller snakes.

CHENNAI: Hundreds of people who get off trains at MGR Central railway station daily find it difficult to access metro trains as the station does not have signage to guide people to the subways leading to the underground Central metro station.

Though Central metro is the city’s largest intermodal hub linking long distance, suburban trains and buses, Southern Railway and Chennai metro rail are yet to arrive at a consensus on setting up signage on the railway premises though discussions have been on for six months.

The metro rail station has five entry/exit points with more than eight elevators linking the platform and street levels, escalators and staircases at all access points.

But since its inauguration, there have been complaints from commuters that they have been not able to find or reach the station from the surrounding areas, including MGR Central, as there are no signages to guide them. Those arriving in the city for the first time experience it more intensely as they are not even aware of the metro facility despite the entry points to the station built at walking distance from the railway station.

Though Southern Railway and CMRL signed an agreement to install signage on railway premises, differing views on board size, number of boards and logo display have stalled the move. Railways say metro rail didn’t consult it on the number of boards, location in the station and size of the boards before giving contract. A metro rail official said southern railway authorities are demanding advertising charges to install signage. “We put up a kiosk in central station paying railways 1,000 a day to direct passengers to the metro facility. But it did not work out, as central has many entry/exit points which passengers use,” the official said. A senior railway official said, “Metro rail wants to put up 4ftX2ft boards on all platforms only with their logo. The boards will be big and may hinder the view of passengers. The design and size of the boards were decided suo motu though they are to be installed on our premises. We are ready to offer 4-5 vantage points to install the boards or we can install the boards as per their specifications. Steps will be taken to resolve the issue soon.”

S Ranganathan, who recently reached MGR Central around 4.30am from Coimbatore, was fleeced by auto drivers, as he was not aware of metro timings. “I was told there is a metro station nearby to reach Shenoy Nagar. I had to ask the auto drivers for directions, as there were no signages or information boards anywhere near the MGR Central. I ended up paying 250 to reach my destination,” he said.

Residents of Sree Vignesh Nagar say it has been a decade since the road was laid. “While the road has not been relaid even once, the corporation dug it up recently to lay drinking water pipelines,” said V Balasubramaniam, secretary of the Sri Vignesh Nagar Welfare Association.

“After that, it has become unmotorable,” said D Rajeshwari, a resident. “When it rains, I take every step cautiously, because I have seen children and women slip and fall while walking and while using two-wheelers.”

Most of the interior roads in Vilankurichi, which is surrounded by residential areas like Cheranma Nagar, Gandhima Nagar, Murugan Nagar and Sree Vignesh Nagar, are in urgent need of repair.

Gandhi Road, which connects Vilankurichi and Saravanampatti is also riddled with potholes. “I don’t even allow my children, aged three and six, ride tricycles on the road. Pits in front of our house is so deep that even two-wheelers get stuck in it,” said M Selvi.

A 40 feet wide road has narrowed down to 20 feet due to dense overgrowth extending from two vacant plots on to the road.

The residents wrote to the chief minister’s cell and the corporation commissioner, requesting them to relay the roads. They event got a traffic sub-inspector, former ward councilor and corporation engineers to inspect the area recently.

The ward assistant engineer said that the roads were not relaid as drinking water pipelines were yet to be laid and connected to the houses. “The situation is the same at the neighbouring areas, including Cheranma Nagar. We are laying the road at Kumudham Nagar as the pipeline work is over there. Once this area is handed back to us after the work, we will relay the road here also,” he said.

Visakhapatnam: The district administration, led by sub-collector of Paderu Dr S Venkateswar has taken up a drive against illegal constructions encroaching upon the Agency area.

A total of 45 illegal constructions in Chintapalli have reportedly been demolished. The process of identifying other illegal structures is going on.

The drive has been taken upon in response to petitions from locals and tribal leaders. Tribal leaders have been complaining that people from the plains have been coming and settling down in Agency areas for business since the space became a tourist hotspot.

Speaking to TOI, tribal activist G Rama Gopal said, “This has been a problem for long. Many people from the plains have come and settled down in the Agency area and in the process have built a number of illegal structures.” According to Gopal, such structures exist in Araku, Paderu, Tajangi, Peddabayalu, Hukumpeta, Lotugeddajunction, Borra Junction and Chintapalli.

DK Balaji, project officer of ITDA, Paderu confirmed that the drive is on. He said that structures are being identified at the moment. “Many of these structures violate the 1of 70 Act which stipulates that transfer of land from tribals to non-tribals cannot happen without the prior permission of the state government.”

Balaji further said that tribal leaders have been complaining that many non-tribals are setting up shops here illegally owing to the burgeoning business opportunities. Sources in the revenue department said that all buildings that have come up in violation of Agency laws are being identified.

Surat: About 170 to 200 passenger car units (PCU) per km per hour per lane density during peak morning and evening hours have made the Ring Road one of the high-density traffic areas of Surat. Built 40 years ago, this 6km long six-lane city’s main arterial road provides majority of commuters coming from the walled city an alternative route for speedy travel to Surat railway station.

However, growth of new residential areas in Athwa and beyond and rise in vehicular population from three lakh vehicles in 1980s to 31 lakhs by 2019 have led to maximum usage of the Ring Road.

Dr Shriniwas Arkatkar, associate professor in transport department of Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT), told TOI, “There are three major problems with Ring Road. It witnesses different types of vehicular activities during different periods of the day. Symbolizing corridor centric development, people have no avenue to turn towards, which leads to heavy traffic density during specific time during the day.”

He said the Ring Road has become the most preferred route for people driving 10 lakh vehicles on daily basis. A team of professors from SVNIT has suggested a few solutions which include use of the road by distinct categories of people during different times.

Dr Arkatkar said, “Surat will have to make use of intelligent traffic management system. City must have Wi-Fi sensors across the space and should start levying congestion charges to deter people from using the road when not required. Most important thing is to find an alternative route.”

Ring Road users

About 10 lakh people use the Ring Road at least once a day. Among its users are four lakh textile traders living in Athwa, two lakh people engaged in different professions and another lakh who have to travel to railway station, GSRTC station and beyond for some casual work in other parts of the city. In Surat, of these 10 lakh people hardly 70,000 use public transport. Most like to travel in their own vehicles.

JAIPUR: Not only medicines, the health department is distributing milk free in the state. On the eve of New Year, stalls were set up by health department officials across the state with glasses filled with hot milk.

It is for the first time that the health department has taken the initiative to set up stalls to offer free milk on New Year eve.

The orders were issued by the National Health Mission (NHM) mission director Naresh Kumar Thakral to all chief medical health officers on December 30. “Nav varsh ki karein shuruat—daru nahin doodh ke saath (begin new year not with liquor but with milk) was the slogan of the health department.

The programmes were organised with the help of donors and NGOs and at many places health department set up stalls on their own.

Health authorities looked busy arranging milk for the event. In Pali district, the health department failed to get support of donors due to paucity of time. Despite that, health officials managed to gather people at Suraj Pole where they took pledge to step into the New Year with milk and not with liquor.

However in Churu, health department provided milk at an event organised at Indramani Park. In Jodhpur , the event was organised on Old University campus in which hundreds of youths were served hot milk.

“The state government is taking measures to make the state addiction free. In this regard, the state government recently imposed a ban on the sale of e-cigarettes and hookah bars,” said health minister Raghu Sharma.

In Jaipur, the event was organised in front of Rajasthan University’s main gate and at Sawai Man Singh Hospital.

“We need support of the people to make the state addiction free, which is why, we asked people to step into new year with milk not liquor,” said Sharma.

Chief medical health officer (Jodhpur) Dr Balwant Manda said, “The milk stall we set up at Old University campus evoked good response. People in large numbers were served hot milk. We started at around 6.30pm and it continued till late night.”

215,['1/01/2020'],NRC: Faked DOB now a big worry for Saudi returnees,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Many people from Hyderabad had migrated to Saudi Arabia in search of work by forging their age on documents. It was a popular trend in the 1980s-90s. But, those who have returned to India now could land themselves in trouble.

They might be in possession of documents reflecting different ages, different names and different dates of birth and may have to knock the doors of courts to get them corrected in the wake of the implementation of CAA, NRC and NPR hanging over their heads.

The required age to migrate to Saudi Arabia is 22 years. The problem is largely prevalent among the city’s minority community, many of whom are now approaching lawyers for a ‘honourable’ way-out. “Not just age, their worries are compounded by the mismatch in the dates of birth and their names,” a lawyer revealed.

Legal experts pointed out that it becomes difficult for those having too many contradictions in date of birth certificates. “If they fail to produce relevant documents, they could be in for a long haul to get the certificates rectified. Approaching courts can be a tedious process,” a legal expert said.

The then Vajpayee government had allowed people from India to migrate to Saudi Arabia if they are going there in search of work. Many youngsters, who were not 22 but were desperate to land a job for themselves, managed to procure passports with help of agents and by mentioning their age as 22.

“Those days, enforcement of rules was not that strict. Taking advantage of this, agents would manufacture fake certificates, submit them at the passport office and get their clients passports,” MA Shakeel, an advocate, explained.

Another problem the Gulf-returnees could face is change in their wives’ names. “At the time of marriage, the bride name could have been entered differently in the passport, while the name in her school certificate could be something else. This lacuna will create problems for them,” another said.

PANAJI: Congress on Tuesday demanded that an FIR be registered against the organisers of EDM festival Sunburn Klassique for the “murder of three men at the event”.

In a letter submitted to the inspector general of police Japsal Singh on Tuesday, Congress said the FIR will send a positive signal to all.

""A delay in investigation may give the culprits time to conceal and suppress crucial evidence. The law must be allowed to take the right course,"" the party stated.

The party has blamed the government's lethargy for the deaths of these youth, and demanded that EDM festivals be banned in the state on the grounds of the death of the tourists. ""Such incidents ruin Goa’s image before the world, and ultimately deter quality tourists from visiting our state. All such things will lead our tourism industry towards doom ,"" said state general secretary of NSUI and youth congress, Janardhan Bhandari, and youth president Varad Mardolkar, in their letter.

They also said the festival should be banned on the grounds that organisers don't follow the rules and regulations that govern such events— like beginning construction and erection work before final permissions are granted, and for inconveniencing local people by causing traffic congestion on the Calangute- Assagao-Anjuna-Baga Siolim stretch.

The EDM events held during the festive season where there is already a heavy inflow of domestic and foreign tourists, creates major traffic snarls along the narrow village roads.

Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan at a protest at Krishnayapalem in Guntur district on Tuesday

VIJAYAWADA: Protests in capital region entered the 14th day on Tuesday with Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan touring the villages and extending his support to agitating farmers. Tensions prevailed at Krishnayapalem after cops stopped him from going towards Mandadam. Defying police restrictions Kalyan moved past wire fences and walked through fields to reach Mandadam as Jana Sena workers along with farmers pushed through the police security ring.

Earlier, Kalyan kicked off his tour at Yerrabalem where he met women on relay hunger strike. Speaking at the protest venue, he took on the state government over the three capital proposal. He accused the chief minister of going back on his words after accepting Amaravati as capital when he was in opposition.

He also took on the ministers for mocking the farmers as ‘paid artists’ and terming Amaravati a desert. He said had Jaganmohan Reddy opposed the proposal of making Amaravati the capital, farmers would not have given their lands.

He urged the farmers not to stop their fight for Amaravati and assured them of support. The Jana Sena chief also said he would take up the issue with the Union government.

He criticised the police for trying to obstruct his tour. He said police bosses who have given orders to their subordinates must remember that political parties are not permanent but the govenrment and people are, and they should abide by the rules.

Meanwhile, dharnas, hunger strikes and rasta rokos continued in other parts of Amaravati. Former irrigation minister and TDP functionary Devineni Umamaheswara Rao sat on a day-long hunger strike in support of the farmers. TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu has given a call to party workers to stay away from New Year celebrations in support of the protests. Naidu announced that he would visit the capital region on January 1 to spend the day with agitating farmers.

218,['1/01/2020'],Introspection must for intersections,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Surat: Huge and ill-conceived traffic islands on city roads are one of the factors behind traffic congestion. Surat whose estimated population is around 50 lakhs, boasts of 4,000km road network with 31 lakh vehicles jostling for space. Officials of transport department of Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT), who are conducting a survey of more than 70 intersections to identify traffic issues, have identified Sahara Darwaja, Hira Baug, Athwagate and Anuvrat Dwar among 11 top junctions with traffic density of around one lakh PCUs per day.

“We have places where there is a blind approach at intersection like the one at Anuvrat Dwar. Six roads cross each other here and minor accidents are a daily occurrence,” said Rajesh Patel, a resident of Vesu.

Dr Gaurang Joshi, a member of faculty of transport department, SVNIT, said, “The purpose of an intersection is that it is a transfer point for one to move to another road. The approach should be easily accessible to any vehicle rider. It should not be more than 10 per cent of passenger car unit (PCU) density of approaching roads.”

“In Surat city, majority of intersections have been built without any futuristic angle. Now an exercise is being carried out with future population projections keeping geometric, traffic and architectural designs in mind,” said Rajesh Pandya, deputy commissioner, Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC).

“We have an urgent need to convert uncontrolled intersections into signalized intersections. We are making required arrangements for this in our project. We will also have to get real-time traffic management system data and use it regularly to exercise control over our intersections,” said Dr Shriniwas Arkatkar, associate professor, SVNIT.

219,['1/01/2020'],Age of ‘child’ should be increased from 16 to 18 yrs: Child rights body,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Panaji: The Commission for Protection of Child Rights has proposed that the age of a child, under the Goa Children’s Act 2003, which is up to 16 years, be raised to 18 to bring it on par with the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and other acts.

The commission’s chairperson, Sushma Chodankar, has stated that this will help fast-track cases where children are victims.

“Cases where the victim is up to 16 years go to the Goa children’s court while those in the age group of 16-18 years are sent to the sessions courts designated at POCSO courts. This sometimes creates confusion and delays in cases,” Chodankar said.

In its final draft amendment of the Goa Children’s Act 2003, submitted to the government on Thursday, the commission also highlighted a host of other changes. These include the need for a second children’s court in South Goa to handle the large number of cases and bring speedy justice to victims as well as save them the inconvenience from travelling from one end of the state to the other.

Instead of the secretary of the department of women and child, the commission has proposed that, depending on the type of offence, secretaries of the respective departments — education, health, labour and others — be held accountable under the act.

The commission also wants all private lodging and boarding homes and orphanages to be mandatorily registered with the directorate of women and child development, while childcare institutions specifically for children in need of care and protection be required to register themselves, under the Juvenile Justice Act, with the directorate.

Much confusion arose recently about private boarding homes housing children on the request of their parents, registering themselves, and ultimately, the court had to intervene.

After going through the suggestions, comments and rationale from various stakeholders, the commission observed that it is important to mainly focus on the implementation of the act, rather than just carrying out the amendment, as despite the act coming into force in 2003, and rules in 2004, it hasn’t been fully implemented yet.

“At present there are several central acts which cover the issues of children and they should be considered while carrying out amendments to the Goa Children’s Act 2003 & Rules, 2004 as the central act prevails over state legislations,”said Chodankar said.

Citizens queue up at Trimulgherry head post office to enrol for new Aadhar cards on Tuesday

SECUNDERABAD: With people rushing to get their documentation in order, in light of the controversy surrounding Citizenship Amendment Act, tempers flared at Trimulgherry head post office in Lal Bazaar on Tuesday. About 50 people were seen waiting in a queue to enrol themselves for new Aadhaar cards. Some had been waiting from 6.30am. With staff at the post office giving out only 20 tokens, many of them became furious after being denied the chance to submit their application.

“People were waiting in line for hours. When they were told to come back later, many got desperate,” said Robin Zaccheus, an activist who witnessed the scene. Tweeting about it, he said, “Look at the pain people are going through standing in rain.”

“They wrote my name on a piece of paper around 6.30am. When I returned at 10am, the chit with my name was missing,” said one woman, not wanting to be named. She said that she would return another day to complete the process.

A notice near the post office states that timings for weekdays are from 9am to 3pm for non-financial issues.

However, people said there was no point of the timings being set considering that they had placed an arbitrary token system. “I was standing in line since 8am, but could not get a token. The chits were over before time,” said Sneha Lahmu , a resident of Yapral.

Post office officials simply said they were short-staffed. Replying, from their official handle @IndiaPostOffice asked for the name of the post office name and pincode to address the issue.

TimesView At a time when the country is reeling under unemployment and the youth searching for jobs, the demand by a section of candidates to postpone the RPSC exam for teachers is not just a betrayal of lakhs of other candidates who are preparing for the same but downright arbitrary. Many come from economically weaker sections and will suffer financially from the disruption of exams. Politicians who have come in support of protesting candidates too should have thought about the future of those who are preparing for the test. If the exams are postponed, it will result in financial loss to the government which has completed preparations. Any change in the schedule will disrupt RPSC’s calendar of exams and the government should resist all pressure and desist from any such move.

JAIPUR: Two girl students, who had climbed up an overhead water tank near the Aravali hostel on Rajasthan University campus on Monday demanding postponement of first grade teachers’ exam, have refused to come down despite efforts by the administration. The issue has been going on for the last one month. Exam is scheduled for January 3, 2020, and government has made it clear that it will be held on time.Both the girls spent the coldest night of the winter on the water tank in an attempt to force the government accept their demand.Mahendra Meena, a candidate who is supporting the agitation, said the government was not looking at the plight of aspirants. “In October, the RPSC declared that the exam will be held in the summer of 2020, but after a week, forms were published and on November 4, 2019, date of the exam was announced,” said Mahendra.CM Ashok Gehlot announced that for protesting candidates, another exam for the first grade will be conducted in September 2020 for 3,000 posts.

SURAT: The world’s fastest growing city has slipped 18 places in the the latest Swachhata Sarvekshan results of which were announced by the union ministry for housing and urban affairs for the first and second quarter of the current financial year on Tuesday.

Touted to be one of the cleanest cities of Gujarat , Surat had secured a second all-India rank in the survey for the previous quarter.

Banchhanidhi Pani, municipal commissioner, however said that the first two quarters carried only 22% weightage of the total marks. “In the first quarter, we had excellent citizens feedback which was not so good in the next quarter. A team of IPSOS agency will visit the city in the second week of January for inspection, when we expect that the ranking will improve.”

Dr Ashish Naik, deputy commissioner of health added, ““In the third quarter, the official team will make personal visit to the city and take citizen feedback for validation. We expect to reach the top again like the first quarter in the next survey.”

Meanwhile, three cities- Rajkot, Vadodara and Ahmedabad - have been ranked in the top 10 cities in the survey. Rajkot has surprised many by bagging the second position while Ahmedabad was ranked sixth.

Ahmedabad improved its position by one notch as compared to first quarter. However, Vadodara which was not in the top 20 list of the cities with over 10 lakh population suddenly jumped to the fourth position overtaking Ahmedabad and Surat city which was ranked third in first quarter fell to the 20th position.

Porbandar town, which was so far included in the list of cities does not find place in the top 20 with over one lakh population.

Kolhapur: Meat shop operators stopped selling mutton for a brief while on December 31 morning.

The operators were upset as several Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) and Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) officials came to their shops and asked them to get the animal slaughtered at the KMC’s slaughterhouse in Bapat Camp.

The shop operators claimed that they were made to wait for hours to get their animals — sheep and goat — slaughtered. Therefore, they decided to slaughter the animals at the back of their own shops. However, according to rules, it is mandatory to get the animals’ health checked by a KMC veterinary officer and animals must be slaughtered only at the KMC’s slaughterhouse.

The meat operators kept the shops closed for some times and this caused immense inconvenience to citizens looking to buy mutton.

Local citizens said the KMC and FDA should not impose strict rules on any day of celebration. They said since the demand for meat goes up on such days, the restrictions should be eased so that everyone gets to buy mutton.

Vijay Patil, the chief veterinary officer of KMC, said, “Around 280 goats and sheep were cut since morning at our slaughterhouse. We have appealed to the citizens to get the meat only from animals certified by us. The meat operators oppose this rule, but we have to follow it. Over the past few days, the slaughterhouse has remained open. Upon FDA action, the meat shop operators got their animals verified. Though there is a demand to ease the restrictions, we cannot compromise on citizens’ health.”

Mutton-lovers in the city also complained that due to the increase in demand, the mutton shop operators were selling mutton at higher prices. They claimed that mutton was sold in the city for Rs 560 (or more) per kg. The district administration-appointed panel of 25 members had fixed the mutton price at Rs 480 per kg. The meat shop operators’ association claimed that none of its member had sold the mutton above the fixed price.

Coimbatore: The district administration has identified about 20 acres at Sulur here to set up the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) technology centre in the district. The centre is expected to help the entrepreneurs in and around the district to help improve their standards to meet international competition.

The union ministry of MSME had sanctioned Rs 200 crore to set up the centre in the district under the scheme ‘establishment of new technology centres’.

“The selected land is fulfilling the specifications, including a non-residential area and with adequate transportation facilities, that are required to set up the centre. A team of MSME officials from New Delhi is expected to inspect the land within a week or two. Once they approve the site, the project would move to the next stage, which is floating tenders to construct the centre,” said R Vijayakumar, assistant director in-charge of MSME Development Institute, Coimbatore.

Vijayakumar said they have been planning to procure latest equipment in all sections including textile and automobiles after holding talks with the representatives of each association.

Pointing out that several MSMEs could not afford to purchase high-cost equipment, Vijayakumar said such equipment would be procured and made available for the industries to use. This will help entrepreneurs to meet international competition and infuse confidence to budding MSMEs.

Besides aiding about 50,000 MSMEs in the district, the centre would be useful for MSMEs functioning in nearby districts too. We are also planning to train students, and the district being an educational hub, it would be useful to a lot of students, he said.

A similar centre was sanctioned in Kochi about one-and-half years before and construction is underway. Last year, Chennai was sanctioned such a centre.

CHENNAI: The Madras high court has ordered notice to the state government on a PIL seeking direction to initiate stringent measures to curtail the illegal practice of receiving and giving gifts by government employees .

Admitting the plea moved by A Sampath, a retired state government employee, a vacation bench of Justice S Vaidyanathan and Justice P T Asha directed the authorities to respond to the plea in two weeks.

According to the petitioner, the state government had to strictly comply with Rule 3 of Tamil Nadu Government Service and Conduct Rules, which relate to avoidance of gifts and rewards in expectation of favour or anything in return.

Referring to a HC division bench order, the petitioner submitted that the DGP issued a circular dated July 12 to ensure strict implementation of the rule in compliance with the court order.

However, despite such a circular, gifts have been illegally accepted by the government employees, particularly during festival seasons, he said.

Therefore, the petitioner said, he made a representation to the authorities on October 3 requesting them to issue circulars to all the departments and to take appropriate action against those who indulge in such activities.

The authorities replied to the communication stating that the rule has been strictly implemented and that there is no need for issuing a separate government order for the same, he said.

Vijayawada: 2019 has proved to be a year of reverse tenders for the government in engineering works. It also proved to be the year of reversing the decisions of the previous government that is causing tremors in the state.

While the government claims that it had saved close to Rs 2,000 crore in reverse tendering in 15 works, including the prestigious Polavaram Project, the reverse decision on the capital has turned politics in the state too hot in this year-ending winter season.

The government started the reverse tendering process alleging that the previous TDP government indulged in huge corruption in irrigation projects and other contracts. It started with the Polavaram Project where the government claimed to have saved Rs 782.80 crore in head works and power plant work of the project.

Starting from the irrigation projects, the government went for reverse tendering in every work starting from housing for the poor and weaker sections in the state to the purchase of stationery in government offices.

The YSRC government claimed that it had saved Rs 65.47 crore in purchase of computers and printers. Even in the purchase of mobiles for the secretariat staff and the mobile SIM cards for the village secretariat staff, the government had saved Rs 33.77 crore and Rs 83.80 crore respectively.

While there is a sort of positive feeling among people on saving money from the contracts, there is some disturbance and discontentment on the move to have three capitals for the state, which is seen as a reverse of the previous government’s decision.

Farmers in Amaravati are holding protests and the political parties are taking advantage of the situation. However, people in Rayalaseema are celebrating the government’s plan to locate the high court in Kurnool and those in Uttarandhra are celebrating the proposal for an executive capital.

The year thus ends with a note of protest in Amaravati and celebrations in the rest of the state.

Police and the child’s relatives at the hospital in Alwar on Tuesday

ALWAR/JAIPUR: A 15-day-old baby girl suffered serious burns on her face after a paediatric ward in a hospital caught fire because of a short circuit.

The girl was in an incubator and following the short circuit there was leakage in the oxygen supply pipe connected to the mask which was on her mouth due to which her face suffered 80% burns. A committee has been formed to look into the negligence on the part of the hospital.

The infant was admitted to Geetanand Children Hospital in Alwar a ago back and was said to be recovering when the incident happened on Tuesday morning. She was referred to Jaipur for further treatment. She is currently battling for life.

Her father Rahul Gaur told TOI, “We got my daughter admitted a week back as she was suffering from breathing problems. However, after treatment she recovering and we saw her on Monday at 10pm when she was absolutely fine. Around 5am on Tuesday, we got a call from the hospital asking us to rush there as there had been some kind of emergency. This is sheer negligence on the part of the hospital staff who slept off during the night when they should have been taking care of my baby. They would not let us enter the ward and were responsible for taking care of all the children admitted there but they failed in their duty.”

Apart from the infant, there were 14 other children in the ward at the time of the incident though they all were rescued on time.

Meanwhile, the hospital officials claimed that they were taking necessary measures to ensure that such accidents don’t happen in future. Hospital’s chief medical health officer Sunil Chauhan said, “The child’s face was burnt and she will need plastic surgery. We have called electricians to inspect the ward and make the necessary changes so that this kind of incident is not repeated in future.”

A team of state’s health department also reached Alwar and will conduct an inquiry into the matter, the report for which is to be submitted in 24 hours.

File picture of police carrying out investigation in the matter

JAIPUR: Police detained two juveniles for the murder of an 11-year-old boy whose body was found buried at Lohagarh Stadium in Bharatpur on December 28, three days after he went missing.

According to police, the two accused played at the same stadium with the victim and killed him with the intention to demand Rs 2 lakh ransom from the parents.

The deceased, identified as Prayanshu Jatav, was reported missing on December 25 when he did not come back after playing at the stadium.

Police teams started a search and finally his body was found.

He was strangulated and buried near a toilet inside the stadium. The child’s family claimed that Prayanshu would go to the stadium daily to play.

On December 25, when he did not come back, his family started looking for him. When they could not find him, they lodged a missing person complaint.

Bharatpur SP Haider Ali Zaidi said, “Two minor boys, who also played at the stadium, were the ones who murdered him. They strangulated him and buried his body at the stadium itself. We questioned the other children who were also present at the stadium on the day of the incident. A few of them told us that they had left for home before Prayanshu, who stayed back with the accused minors. We started looking at their activities closely from the recovered CCTV footage and detained them. They confessed to killing the boy with the intention to take Rs 2 lakh ransom from his parents.”

The victim’s cricket bat and ball were also recovered from the accused and police are investigating the case.

Few hours after the body was found near a hospital, the police detained the boy’s former tuition teacher. Police claimed that the accused called the child’s parents for a ransom of Rs 3 crore, but murdered him before that.

Kolhapur: Observing ‘ no vehicle day ,’ mayor Surmanjiri Latkar travelled to the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) building in a Kolhapur Municipal Transport (KMT) bus on Tuesday while civic chief Mallinath Kalshetti rode a bicycle from his residence to office.

Besides Latkar and Kalshetti, several corporators shunned their private and officials vehicles and opted for public transport. Some officials who reside close to their offices chose to walk.

Latkar, along with some local corporators, boarded a KMT bus to Shivaji Chowk in the morning. She was greeted by passengers who lauded her initiative. After alighting from the bus, Latkar walked to the municipal corporation building where the mayor’s office is located.

Among others who travelled by bus were standing committee chairman Sharangdhar Deshmukh and transport committee chairman Abhijit Chavan. They boarded a bus from Saneguruji Vasahat to Shivaji Chowk.

“We have unanimously decided to observe ‘no-vehicle day’ on the last day of every month. This was our first no-vehicle day. On this day, we will avoid using our official and private vehicles. I, along with some of the corporators, travelled in a bus. With so much traffic and pollution, it is important for everyone to undertake and support such initiatives. Our initiative serves both the purposes — reduces private vehicles on roads and reduces air pollution. We had appealed to the citizens to take part in this initiative. Respecting our appeal, many citizens shunned their private vehicles and travelled either by the buses or rickshaws,” said Latkar.

With more people using public transport such as KMT buses, they have contributed their bit to the revenue generation of the ailing public transport.

It took around 30 minutes for the civic chief to reach the municipal corporation building from his residence in Tarabai Park. “My fellow officers travelled by KMT buses. Some of them joined me with their bicycles. The intended purpose will be addressed by this initiative and will also help improve our health, especially of those who travel by bicycle as it is a good exercise,” said Kalshetti.

The visible effect of the initiative was seen in the Vitthal Ramji Shinde Chowk which is usually overcrowded with the vehicles of corporators, officials and visitors. The said area looked deserted even on a working day.

The accused in police custody

SURAT: Police busted a racket with the arrest of two persons who were using fake details and documents along with thumb impressions of unsuspecting people to issue Aadhaar Card in Umargam of Valsad district on Tuesday. The accused persons were making use of an authorized computer and kit together with the thumb impressions of people taken on a rubber like material to issue dubious Aadhaar Card to them.

Vinesh alias Bunty Dhansukh Bhandari, a resident of Umargam, and Karanjeet Singh, a resident of Vapi but native of Patna in Bihar, were produced by the police in a court at Nargol. The court remanded them in police custody till January 6.

Police have recovered two laptops, a fingerprint scanner, GPS devices and cash worth Rs2.64 lakh from the accused. Acting on a specific information, the police raided Bhandari’s office in Hari Residency on Umargam Gandhiwadi GIDC Road and nabbed him. Singh was nabbed from there when he came to deliver a laptop to Bhandari. A laptop was later recovered by the police from Singh’s office in Daman where he was involved in a similar activity, police said.

Police declared Sarthak Borad, Guddu Rai and Viral Pansuriya, who live in different parts of the state, along with Anantram Patel, a resident of Indore in Madhya Pradesh, as wanted.

The accused first made fake PAN card and election identity card using the photo of their customer with fake details. “They made these identity cards by simply taking the colour prints on plastic cards. These fake cards were submitted to get Aadhaar Card,” Valsad superintendent of police Sunil Joshi told TOI.

Police found that the accused used rubber thumb impression stamps. They developed thumb impressions using an adhesive on the stamp, police said, adding that they have recovered two such stamps.

The seized kit includes laptops, a fingerprint scanner and a GPS device which used to be frequently replaced. The laptops had Aadhaar Card application installed in it. In a month, the kit was replaced at least four times, the accused have informed police.

NASHIK: The average wholesale onion price has dropped by 34%, from Rs 6,900 per quintal on Friday to Rs 4,500 per quintal on Tuesday, due to a rise in supply at the Lasalgaon APMC.

The market saw huge fluctuations in the onion prices throughout the month of December. The average wholesale price was around Rs 7,000 per quintal in the first week of December, but dropped to Rs 4,700 per quintal on December 9.

The average wholesale price shot up again in following days and recorded an all-time high of Rs 8,625 per quintal on December 16 due to shortage of supply against demand. The average price then dropped by around 40% to Rs 5,200 per quintal on December 23. However, the average wholesale onion price again shot up to Rs 6,901 per quintal on December 27.

“The supply of onions was around 10-12,000 per quintals a day around a fortnight back, but fresh kharif onion arrival crossed the 20,000-quintal mark a day at Lasalgaon for the past two-three days. This led to a drop in the wholesale prices,” said APMC officials.

“Incessant rain between July and October damaged around 75% of the kharif onion plantation in major onion pockets of Maharashtra , including Nashik , which is one of the major onion growing area.

The harvest of onions on the remaining 25% of the acreage has begun now, but the yield has reduced a lot. Moreover, there has been adequate plantation of kharif onions, the harvest of which has now begin but in a low quantity.

The harvest of late kharif onions will pick up in a week or two, which result in higher supply and lower prices. The average wholesale onion price is expected to drop again by another Rs 1,000 per quintal to Rs 3,500 per quintal in the period.

Bijnor: With a killer leopardess on the loose in Bijnor and as many as 800 primary and upper primary schools in the district without boundary walls, lives of 24,000 children studying in these institutions are at risk. Several teachers approached the basic shiksha adhikari’s office on Tuesday expressing apprehension that they could be sitting ducks for the big cat that has killed five persons in the district in a month.

While the schools are closed for the students until January 2, the teachers continue to come to complete paperwork.

The leopardess has left forest officials flummoxed by refusing to enter cages and traps set by them in the past few weeks.

Five persons, including a woman and a kid, were killed in leopard attacks in the district last month while several sustained injuries.

The big cat had first killed a woman in Nawada village under Nagina Dehat police station on November 27. Since then, four other deaths have occurred.

It is yet to be ascertained if a single leopardess killed all these persons or there are others too.

According to forest officials, the leopardess has not attacked villagers in the past few days. It seems it is getting enough prey here along the Malan river.

Meanwhile, district coordinator of Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan, Salim Beg, said insecurity and fear have grown among teachers in the district. Education department has issued advisory to all teachers, kids and their parents.

“We has urged parents to pick and drop their children. In addition, teachers have been asked not to allow kids to venture out the school building while studying. Teachers should also be alert while travelling to the schools. The construction project of boundary walls around schools is in pile line. We have submitted proposal to the district panchayat raj dept,” Beg said.

There are 2,556 primary and upper primary schools in Bijnor district. Out of these, 400 schools are located in remote areas in Kotwali Dehat, Najibabad and Afzalgarh blocks. According to the the basic education department data, 450 schools do not have boundary walls around institutions. Besides, construction work of boundaries around 350 schools is incomplete posing threat not only to kids but teachers also. Many of these schools are close to sugarcane fields which is often an ideal hideout for leopards looking for preys in human habitation.

Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran said the forest officials are studying the big cat’s pugmarks to locate it. “We have set up cages and installed camera traps to trace its location. It is still camping in Mohandiya village area. I hope it will be caught soon,” he said.

When the plea came up for hearing on Monday, a vacation bench of Justices S Vaidyanathan and P T Asha directed the government counsel to get instructions from the authorities concerned and adjourned the plea to January 6.

According to U Kasipandiyan, the petitioner, the state government had on January 13 issued a notification to fill 31 district judge posts. The upper age limit for candidates from other backward communities was fixed as 48 years. For unreserved categories, the age limit was fixed as 45.

However, as not even a single candidate, who appeared for the written exam, managed to clear it, the recruitment process was deferred. Subsequently, on December 12 the state issued a fresh notification for direct recruitment for 32 posts of entry-level district judges. In the fresh notification, no upper age limit was fixed for candidates from other backward communities. As no upper age limit was fixed, 45 years fixed for unreserved categories will apply to other backward communities too.

He was speaking on ‘India 2020- Dr BR Ambedkar’s vision of liberty, equality and fraternity’, organized by Manthan at Chitnavis Centre.

Talking about the lessons one can draw from Ambedkar’s life and his works, Ranganathan said, “As a nation, we choose to follow the road traversed by Gandhi and Nehru when we should be following Ambedkar’s footsteps. It’s not that we don’t understand Ambedkar and his ideologies, we just fear him as he was a man with authoritative stance on various subjects.”

Ranganathan, a recipient of prestigious Nehru Centenary Scholarship, stated that to understand the phenomenon that is Ambedkar, one needs to understand the man himself which includes his childhood. He then took the audience on a journey of Ambedkar’s childhood and his experience with untouchability.

He said “Ambedkar was the first untouchable to receive a scholarship at Columbia university. ‘First untouchable’ — an epithet used without knowing what evil lay within it, an epithet laced with unfathomable shame. The year was 1913 and he was liberated from the shackles put on him by his motherland, of caste prejudice and untouchability.”

He said Ambedkar later expressed how those years wiped the concept of untouchability from his consciousness.

“Being neutral is different from being objective. Being neutral is actually to take sides. When talking of human cruelty, one cannot, at the same time, talk of human genius, one cannot let anger subside, and the veins must not lose their bulge,” he said.

“Crimes against Dalits will not stop just because we have laws to punish the perpetrators. The solution is to seek inspiration from a man of black and white, Ambedkar himself and his works,” said Ranganathan.

People in Sikar witnessed bone-chilling cold in this season so far as a minimum temperature below 0°C was recorded in Sikar a few times in this season. Attributing the climatic change to the active western disturbances and upper air cyclonic circulation, the Jaipur Met office said that mild showers, lightning and hailstorm will occur at many places in the northern and eastern parts of the state in the next 24 hours.

After a continued dip in mercury, people in Jaipur experienced minor respite as a minimum temperature of 2.7°C was recorded in the city.

Representative image

CHENNAI: The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has directed the Tamil Nadu government to pay Rs 60,000 to a farmer who was abused and assaulted by the Tirunelveli district police personnel, for not producing original vehicle documents during a check.

According to the petition by Paulson, he had produced photocopies of the registration certificate (RC), which police didn’t accept and abused and assaulted him. The commission has also recommended disciplinary action against the police personnel.

Paulson was returning home after work on his two-wheeler in June 2013, when he was intercepted by special sub-inspector Samuthiram.

The special sub-inspector had asked for the RC and driving licence, following which Paulson provided the photocopy of the RC and said the licence was at home and he could fetch it from there. At this, sub-inspector Manojkumar began abusing and slapped him, while two other police personnel too assaulted him, Paulson said.

In response, the police personnel said Paulson was riding without a number plate and when asked to produce the documents, he used unparliamentary language against police and pulled the clothes of one of them. The complainant was arrested for this and produced before the magistrate.

After examining the submissions, the commission noted that there was human rights violation on the part of police and held that the complainant was eligible for compensation .

In another petition before the commission, S Raj Padmanabhan of Old Pallavaram in Chennai alleged threats and biased action by the Madipakkam police against him and his aides while settling a family dispute.

In July 2017, the complainant’s father-in-law had gone to a relative’s house to discuss the partition of a property and was assaulted.

Raj Padmanabhan said in his petition that the Madipakkam police registered a criminal case against him, by allegedly siding with the opposite party.

Police denied the allegations and stated the complainant and his aides had issued death threats to another person after which the case was registered. Police also denied demanding bribe to settle the case.

After examining the submissions, the rights commission held there was human rights violation and directed the state government to pay Rs 25,000 to the complainant.

JAIPUR: The Congress on Tuesday sought an apology from Rajasthan BJP president Satish Poonia for dubbing chief minister Ashok Gehlot as a person suffering from “short-term memory loss” and “depression”.

Pradesh Congress Committee’s vice-president Archana Sharma said Poonia's remarks were condemnable and “reflected the negative mindset of his party”. “There can be ideological differences in parties and criticism can be based on that but making such personal comments cannot be tolerated. It appears that Poonia himself is insecure about his position. Therefore, he stooped so low in making the statement,” Sharma said. Sharma also hailed the performance of the state government in the past one year and claimed that the BJP was finding it difficult to digest that.

Representational Image

MEERUT: As 2019 comes to an end, a quick glance at the crime statistics of Meerut zone – one of the most restive areas of West UP – shows that there has been a dip in crimes.

The data has been compiled by the police authorities. The maximum dip has been reported in crime against women -- kidnapping of women registered a 36.22% decrease while cases of harassment declined by 30.84%.

Meerut zone constitutes nine districts -- Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Shamli, Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Hapur and Meerut.

Prashant Kumar, ADG, Meerut zone, said, “The reason behind a dip in crime rate in Meerut zone is that the police have been given a free hand to deal with criminals. There is no political interference of any kind by the current government. There is no recommendation of any sort to let off anyone and hence, the accused have to face consequences. Apart from this, team work of the police have given positive results.”

In women-related crimes, cases have registered a dip in kidnapping (36.22%), harassment (30.84%), murder (16.11%), sexual assault (10.76%), rape (10.28%), dowry death (2.07%) and chain snatching (0.5%). The other crimes which registered a dip include arson (14.33%), robbery (13.04%), murder (6.50%), loot (4.03%), kidnapping (3.78%), vehicle theft (3.36%) and thefts (1.59%), according to statistics provided by UP Police.

Meanwhile, 945 police encounters took place in which 20 people died and 1,624 were arrested – out of whom 674 were injured. As many as 156 police personnel were also injured in the encounters.

Asked about the criticism that UP police often faces due to the “free hand” given to them – be it police encounters or anti-CAA protests, Kumar, said, “In cases where police see unruly crowd or arson, we cannot stand there as mere spectators. We are legally authorized to resort to a lathicharge or take action as is necessary at that time. So many encounters have taken place and they have been cleared by the NHRC. These steps are necessary to maintain law and order situation here.”

NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has snapped 425 connections of water tax defaulters in the last week of December.

The authority has decided on stern action against the pending tax dues, which has now totalled to Rs 5 crore in the past fortnight.

The civic body has set a water tax collection target of Rs 64 crore for the current fiscal year. So far, they have collected tax amounting to Rs 38 crore which is 26 crore short of the target. “We have intensified our drive against water tax defaulters. We have already started snapping connections of tax defaulters,” said an NMC official.

The municipal commissioner Mallinath Kalshetti has directed all the six divisional offices to snap at least 10 water connections of defaulters on a daily basis in each division, added an official. “Around a fortnight back, we had also conducted a drive and snapped 208 water connections of the defaulters. Of which, 70 defaulters have cleared their dues and we have re-connected their water connections,” said an official.

Out of total 425 water connections snapped, 102 were from Satpur division, 95 from Cidco, 82 from Nashik West, 59 in Panchavati, 47 in Nashik Road and 40 in Nashik East division.

In the month of August and September, a total of 2,700 water connections were snapped and their water was resumed after the dues were paid.

Due to the state assembly elections in October, the NMC could not take any action as most of the staff was busy in elections. They have now focused their attention on the recovery of taxes.

The city has 1.96 lakh water connections which include 1.88 lakh residential, 4,000 commercial and remaining 4,000 non-commercial water connections.

To further achieve their target the NMC has introduced an amnesty scheme for property tax defaulters, which has a February 10 deadline. Citizens can take advantage of the scheme and pay the taxes with minimal interest.

Earlier, NMC had put a condition to tax defaulters of clearing water tax dues first to take benefits of an amnesty scheme for property taxes. But due to cold response in the first 15 days, the civic body decided to withdraw this condition.

GURUGRAM: A 30-year-old woman was found dead under mysterious circumstances in a Sector 47 guesthouse on Monday, a day after she had checked into the facility with two youths. While the cause of her death hasn’t been ascertained yet, an FIR has been filed for murder and the youths have been detained for questioning.

Sunaina, a resident of Bhiwani, had booked two rooms — one for herself and the other for the men. The youths left the guesthouse in the early hours of Monday. A few hours later, she was found dead in her room.

Police said Sunaina got married to Ram Charan (41), also a Bhiwani resident, around 10 years ago. They have a nine-year-old son. Ram Charan works at a shop in Bhiwani, while Sunaina was working at a car showroom in Bhiwani. Six months ago, she moved to the Gurugram branch of the same agency and started living in a paying guest accommodation, leaving her son behind with her husband in Bhiwani.

Preliminary investigation revealed that Sunaina booked two rooms in the guesthouse through a mobile app on Sunday. They checked into the facility at 11.30pm. Around 4am the next day, the two youths checked out.

Police said they received a call from the guesthouse staff around 8am informing them that Sunaina wasn’t opening the door despite repeated knocks. A team soon reached the spot. The door of the room was unlocked and Sunaina was found dead. Police said the body was found facedown on the floor with the legs on the bed. Sunaina was identified with the help of the identity proof she had submitted at the time of check-in.

Police informed her mother of the death, who in turn informed Ram Charan. “I got a call from my mother-in-law saying that my wife was dead. We reached Gurugram late on Monday night. I suspect that Sunaina was murdered by the two men,” Ram Charan said.

The two youths were detained on Tuesday morning and are being interrogated on their alleged involvement in the murder, police said. On the basis of a complaint filed by Ram Charan, an FIR was filed under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC at Sadar police station later in the day. Her body was handed over to the family after an autopsy.

According to the autopsy report, the cause of death isn’t clear, SHO Basant Kumar said. “There was no injury on the body. Viscera samples have been sent to a forensic lab for further tests. We will be able to know the cause of death after the lab sends its report. Meanwhile, we’ve lodged a case and are interrogating the two youths,” the SHO added.

Former SCB ward member J Pratap interacts with residents of Ward-I

SECUNDERABAD: While the Union ministry of defence (MoD) is yet to issue the official notification for elections in civilian wards of cantonments across the country, campaigning for the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) is already underway. Aspirants and former board members have begun their ‘padyatras’ to interact with and woo voters across wards in the country’s largest cantonment. Resolving issues pertaining to water, sanitation and roads are the key points in the campaign agendas of aspirants.

On December 19, officials of the cantonment board had completed the process of reservation of wards for women candidates. As per the official announcement, ward numbers II, V and VI have been reserved for women. Wards I, III, IV and VII have been reserved for general category while ward VII is reserved for candidates of scheduled caste (SC).

Aspirants began their campaigning as soon as the board had announced the reservations for the respective wards. Those hoping to win seats on the board include former SCB ward members, representatives of civic groups, founders of NGOs, local youth leaders and family members of current ward members. For instance, in Ward-I, former SCB vice-president Jampana Pratap has decided to contest and has started his campaign with Jakkula Maheshwar Reddy, who is currently representing the ward, also keen to contest for a second time.

“I have kept in touch with voters of the ward even before the reservation process. I am confident of my chances of winning the ward this time,” J Pratap told TOI. Meanwhile, current ward member Maheswhar Reddy is also confident of his chances. According to him, development work under his tenure should secure him another term.

“The election notification is expected by third week of January,” said an SCB official on condition of anonymity. There is still no clarity from the MoD on whether the SCP polls will be conducted through ballot papers or electronic voting machines. “We are ready for whatever the MoD decides,” the official said.

HYDERABAD: Students ’ union of English and Foreign Languages University ( EFLU ), on Tuesday, staged a dharna on campus against the university’s decision to shut down hostels till January 17.

Students said that shutting down hostels and rescheduling the academic calendar citing renovation as a reason was unacceptable. They also went on to describe the move by the authorities as “incompetent”. They claimed that students have already started reaching the campus and were being stopped from getting into the premises citing a circular that was released on Monday. “The university was supposed to reopen on January 6. However, now it will reopen only on January 20. University officials should rethink their decision, as this will completely disturb the academic schedule,” said a student of the varsity. “Looks like the varsity has extended the vacation only to stop anti-CAA protests on campus.”

In a press statement issued late on Tuesday evening, EFLU authorities stated that renovation works undertaken by the university were not an abrupt issue. “The UGC granted approval to utilise the XII Plan funds and had set a date of March 31, 2020, to utilise the funds. Several civil works have been identified under 26 heads related to sanitation, plumbing, renovation, arresting seepages, and erecting new structures on campus,” stated the statement.

It further added that as the work has to be undertaken in the hostels with heavy machinery and tools, which may cause inconvenience and disturbance to the students, the decision to extend the winter vacation was taken. “These civil works also include renovation of water-supplying facilities, toilets and other basic amenities. So, occupying the hostels will lead to discomfort and inconvenience for the students,” read the statement.

HYDERABAD: Congress MLAs — D Sridhar Babu and D Anasuya alias Sitakka — on Tuesday said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao should stop telling lies to people in the New Year and come out with a white paper on the finance, irrigation, agriculture and other sectors.

Addressing a press conference here, the MLAs said there is no word from the government on the implementation of Rs 1 lakh crop loan waiver though it had completed a year in office. They alleged that KCR ’s flagship Rythu Bandhu scheme has become a sop confined to election-bound areas.

“Except in Huzurnagar which went to bypolls, Rythu Bandhu has not been extended to farmers in several parts of the state. Farmers are also not getting remunerative price for their produce,” Sitakka and Sridhar said.

Sitakka said that KCR should have spoken truth at least after offering prayers in Rajarajeshwara temple in Vemulawada. “Welfare schemes are being implemented only in poll-bound constituencies. The government shold procure every grain of paddy produced by the farmers,” she said.

Meanwhile, senior Congress MLC T Jeevan Reddy slammed the police lathicharge on the oustees of Mid Manair project. The project-affected people were protesting during KCR’s inspection of Mid Manair on Monday. “Did we achieve statehood for the welfare of the people or for KCR’s benefit,” Jeevan Reddy said and added KCR misled the people on water availability from mid-manair for irrigation purposes.

SECUNDERABAD: Plans are afoot to turn Kapra lake in the city into a haven for birds. The development comes as a part of the Centre ’s plan to revive 100 wetlands across the country. A source working with the ministry of environment and climate change said that among the water bodies identified in the state for revival are Kapra in the city and Pakhal in Warangal. “Stakeholders in every state have been informed to send proposals regarding their plan to revive these wetlands,” he said.

In Telangana, the state forest department will work with other agencies as part of the revival effort. “We submitted our proposal and were asked to make some modifications,” said Medchal district forest officer, Ashok Kumar. Kumar has called for a meeting of all stakeholders including residents.

“We will be coordinating with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and irrigation department which have been working on the lake,” Kumar said. Once the discussions take place, Kumar said the process to restore the lake and protect avian species will begin. The project will take at least four years, said sources with knowledge of the project both at the Centre and state level.

Residents for their part welcomed the news. “Among the issues to be discussed are the plantation drive that will take place as well as how to maintain the water quality,” said Jason Wilson, a resident of Sainikpuri. Another local, Deepa Shailendra said: “The lake’s ecosystem supports a variety of birds. Not just this, many people living around the lake are proactive and will be vigilant enough to help any conservation effort.”

The plan for Kapra’s revival comes a few months after NGO Wetlands International created a health map for lakes across the country and gave Kapra a grade ‘D’, one notch above the worst grade on the scorecard. The wetlands were judged on criteria including water quality, inlet and outlet choking, presence of invasive species, water birds, as well as on whether there is an approved map, notification, management plan in place and wetland conversion.

TimesView The recent deaths of 91 infants at the J K Lon Hospital in Kota allegedly due to lack of basic medical facilities is a pointer to the deteriorating healthcare system in the state. After TOI broke the story, the state government had constituted a team of doctors from the SMS Medical College to look into the reasons for such high child mortality. TOI had also written about many basic medical equipment lying unused and the absence of maintenance. Though the team has now submitted its report to the secretary, medical education, for reasons best known to authorities, it has not been made public. The government, which swears by transparency, should make it public and take effective steps to prevent such incidents in the future.

KOTA: BJP’s parliamentary panel comprising Jaskaur Meena, Locket Chatterjee and Kanta Kardam on Tuesday visited Kota ’s J K Lon Hospital where at least 91 kids died in December.The panel expressed displeasure at the alleged mismanagement in the hospital and slammed chief minister Ashok Gehlot for going to Ranchi to take part in the swearing-in ceremony of Hemant Soren in Ranchi but not visiting the Kota hospital .The Congress workers lodged protest against the visit of the panel by forming a human chain outside the hospital and accused the BJP of politicising the sensitive issue of kids’ deaths.The three-member team interacted with the parents and attendants of kids undergoing treatment in the hospital. Chatterjee claimed that the kids died due to infection and added that heaps of filth were lying in the hospital while pigs strayed on the premises.Expressing concern over the lack of infrastructure, the panel said two to three kids were lying in a single bed and the nursing staff was also insufficient. The behavior of the guard with the attendants at the hospital was not good, Chatterjee claimed.Later speaking to reporters, the members of the panel slammed the Gehlot government and accused the CM of insensitivity at the kids’ death.“While the kids are dying in the hospital. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot went to Jharkhand to celebrate formation of Congress government there. The mothers of deceased kids are still shedding tears but the CM is not here to wipe their tears,” Chatterjee said.‘If such an incident had occurred in the Gandhi family, there would have been a national grief across the country,” Chatterjee said.None of the Congress workers reached in the hospital so far, but BJP MLAs in Kota have extended monetary assistance of Rs 50 lakh, she further said.“Gehlotji and Rahulji must come here instead of going to Ranchi, Lucknow and Delhi delivering speeches,” Chatterjee said.On asking about higher number of kids’ death during BJP’s rule in the state in the last five years , Chatterjee said, “It is not a competition between the Congress and the BJP.

COIMBATORE: The residents of Devi Nagar in Vadavalli have petitioned corporation commissioner, requesting him to install a borewell pipeline in the area before the summer season.

They will be forced to depend on local borewells or buy water sold by tankers as drinking water will be supplied only once in 12 days, they said.

During peak summer, when the corporation reduces the frequency of drinking water supply across the city, residents end up using borewell water for all purposes. “Last year, frequency of drinking water supply was reduced to once every 12 days,” said activist N Chandran. “That time, people without borewells struggled to get water for daily uses like cleaning,” he said.

Women in the area said they had a difficult time due to lack of borewell pipeline. “Last year, for an entire month, we received water hardly thrice and in small quantities. We were forced to buy drinking water. We used it for washing and cooking. For the rest, we had to buy water,” said Kavitha, a resident. “We had to carry water collected from the borewell water pipe at the end of Radhe Avenue in plastic pots every day.”

“The corporation had recently dug up the road to lay drainage pipelines. They could have laid a borewell pipeline alongside,” said T Gopi, another resident.

257,['1/01/2020'],What should authorities do to control the population of strays?,"This story is from January 1, 2020

As residents of Yapral complained about a rise in the number of stray dog population, TOI asked readers how the civic body could help solve the issue What should authorities do to control the population of strays ?

Containing the population of strays is a tedious task that cannot be easily handled by authorities alone. First and foremost, dogs should be sterilised periodically round the year in every area. The government should display numbers as helplines so that people can register complaints and act upon them swiftly. A few of the stray dogs who may be aggressive due to a variety of reasons could prove to be harmful to humans. Such dogs should be shifted to an isolated place out of the city where they can be taken care of in an appropriate manner. Dogs in every area are loyal to the people who feed them regularly and who caresses them often. Such people should help the authorities to get them sterilised and inform the authorities of the same - Deepesh Surana

The issue of stray dogs has been there in twin cities for over 40 years now. But improper handling of this issue has made it a serious problem. In any street or locality, the presence stray dogs will do more good than harm. They attack only strangers or when provoked by children and youth. However, if there are incidents of unprovoked attacks, then authorities can tackle the issue in by ascertaining of all the strays in city and classifying them locality wise and colony wise. Authorities must seek the help of animal husbandry officials, dog trainers, veterinary doctors. Pick the dogs up and move them to a far flung places on the outskirts of the city. Let professional folk train them and help these dogs lead a healthy life. These good dogs can be used by the police, CBI and other investigative agencies, and also for watch and ward in various VIP houses and quarters. All other dogs should be sterilized to start with and expert opinions should be sought on how to proceed further. Involve experts and trainers to come out with an apt solution to ensure they do not become a menace. All dogs which are not healthy need treatment. The authorities have to take it up and do it on priority - Ramesh Vemuganti

As the number of stray dogs in the city is multiplying by the day it is important that authorities do something to keep the number in check before it becomes a serious issue. In several areas aggressive dogs have attacked pedestrians, vehicles, and children. Dogs are often caught, and immunised and left in the same place from where they have brought. Instead of this, the government and the GHMC should employ a separate team that ensures that each street has a maximum of two healthy dogs - Nandikanti Sai Kumar

Stray dogs have become a menace to the citizens of the twin cities. This issue is not just limited to Secunderabad . There are specific locations where these stray dogs are posing a problem to residents and commuters and these areas need to be worked on first. Many complaints have been lodged about this menace but GHMC has not been able to take any action in this regard. GHMC is aware of the vulnerable points where these stray dogs are creating a problem. As a veterinarian, I suggest that these stray dogs should be sterilized on war footing to control their population.Secondly, vaccinating these dogs should be taken up immediately and these dogs need to be tagged so as to identify the vaccinated ones. Thirdly, pet lovers can adopt these stray dogs as they are very much immune to certain diseases and can survive small illnesses. Violent and rabid dogs if found, should be put to sleep by the veterinary hospitals after proper inspection ,in the interest of the health of locals - Dr GV Kumar

Authorities need to take a hard stance on the issue. We need to educate people because stray dogs bite children, spread garbage all over the place and create nuisance at night by fighting among themselves. Those feeding stray dogs must be discouraged from doing so. This leads to a large number of dogs moving to one particular street in the hope of finding food. Authorities need to take stringent action to avoid irreversible damage to citizens - Ravi Kumar

Authorities should take the following measures to contain the population of stray dogs in Secunderabad. Sterilisation should be taken up on war footing. Relocation of stray dogs should be done in the outskirts. The dogs must be treated for any health issues that they may have. Residents must be discouraged from feeding these dogs unnecessarily as they tend to crowd the lanes at night looking for food - Nagarjuna Srinivasa Rao

Rajya Sabha member Sudhanshu Trivedi

MEERUT: Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) Rajya Sabha member Sudhanshu Trivedi on Tuesday said Pakistan ’s intelligence agency, ISI , and other “foreign powers” were responsible for the violent anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests across the country.

Addressing a press conference as part of ‘jan jagran abhiyaan’ (public awareness drive) for the CAA at a hotel here in Meerut, Trivedi said, “The violence in the name of anti-CAA protests is a well-thought and strategic move by the ISI and other foreign powers. Otherwise, how is it possible that around 30,000 people participated in the protest at Jamia, which has only 4,000 students? When no Maulana or Ulema protested against the Act, then how did the violence spread so far and wide? The people who are trying to flare up the matter are those who have no political existence.”

He added, “The protesters who are covering their faces and throwing stones at police officers are not students, but professional criminals. Why would students of Jamia Milia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University protest for Assam’s culture? The word ‘Muslim’ is not even there in the CAA, even then why is the Muslim community being incited?”

Claiming that the idea of CAA is the brainchild of the Congress, Trivedi, said, “Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Rajya Sabha had advocated for giving citizenship to non-Muslims of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. On November 25, 1947, the Congress Working Committee had talked about giving refuge to those persecuted in Pakistan on the basis of religion. On September 20, 1947, even Mahatma Gandhi had mentioned this. Then why is the Congress protesting against it?”

Talking about the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), Trivedi said, “No final draft of NRC has been prepared. Work is being done. Presently, the focus is on those people who did not find their name in the NRC in Assam.”

Commenting on the viral video where Meerut SP (City) Akhilesh Narayan Singh was heard shouting at the protesters to go to Pakistan, Trivedi, said, “A clarification has been sought from the administration. However, the same Congress members who go to Pakistan and talk about destabilising Modi government are not worthy of any answer. In the UN, Pakistan had given reference of Rahul Gandhi’s comment.”

However, Union minister Satyapal Singh, who was also in Meerut to spread awareness about the CAA, said the Meerut police should have desisted from making such remarks.

“I saw the video of Meerut SP (city), and I believe it is the best if police ensures maintaining law and order instead of giving any remarks.”

Velsee and Dishit Jariwala in happier times

SURAT: In a huge setback to the police in the sensational Dishit Jariwala murder case, all three accused including his wife were acquitted by a local court on Tuesday, over three-and-a-half-years after the brutal crime.

The court gave them benefit of doubt in absence of strong evidence to prove the murder charges. Moreover, majority of the witnesses turned hostile during the trial.

Dishit’s wife Velsee(25), her friend Suketu alias Sunny Modi (32) and Suketu’s driver Dhirendra Chauhan (37) are set to walk free after acquittal.

“Prosecution could not prove the charges. There were no corroborative evidences,” Bhadresh Dalal, public prosecutor, told TOI. “Witnesses like police personnel and doctors who did the postmortem stayed firm on their statement, but most of the other witnesses turned hostile which affected the case,” Dalal added.

The court had examined 73 witnesses, but there was no eyewitness in the murder. The main witness, an auto rickshaw driver who brought Suketu and Dhirendra to the spot of crime had also turned hostile. Police could not even prove that it was not a murder for loot, said Kirit Panwala, defence lawyer.

“The sequence of chain of events in the court. CCTV footages of Suketu and Dhirendra approaching the house were of no help and the motive of the crime could not also not be proved in court,”

It was alleged in the FIR that Suketu and Velsee were in love and they plotted and executed Dishit’s murder so that they could live together.

Initially, Velsee was the complainant in the case, but after her role was found from the CCTV footages and spot investigation, police became the complainant.

“We will plan future course of action after examining the judgement. We are yet to receive the written order,” said Vidhi Chaudhary, deputy commissioner of police, zone III.

VIJAYAWADA: Minister of agriculture Kurasala Kanna Babu termed the year 2019 as the year of farmers’ welfare. Speaking to media persons in Kakinada , the minister said that chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy had set an example to others by implementing over 80 per cent of the election promises in mere six months.

He referred to the YSR Rythu Bharosa scheme and said it was a blessing in disguise to the farmers in terms of financial assistance. The government also started interest-free loans, free insurance for farmers, free bore well, quality seeds, agriculture laboratories and free power supply to farmlands. The 2020 would start with the government paying the last instalment of the Rythu Bharosa to the farmers on January 2, he said.

The government is also planning to start agriculture workshops in three phases across the state from February 2020. The first phase would have 3,330 centers in February, he said and the number would go up to 11,500 by the end of April, the minister said.

The minister also referred to the Agriculture Mission established under the chairmanship of the chief minister creating Rs 330 crore market intervention fund to support the farmers.

The minister said that the government was gearing up to constitute market yard committees across the state giving due representation to all sections. These committees would help the farmers in finding remunerative price to their produce in the market, the minister said.

The agriculture assistants appointed in the village secretariats would closely help farmers in all spheres in the coming years, the minister said. The officials in the agriculture ministry were asked to work in the field with farmers guiding in the crop management, soil management and other market intervention.

He took a dig at the TDP government for not fulfilling even a single promise made to the farmers in the 2014 Assembly elections. He discounted the allegations of injustice by the government to Amaravati farmers and advised farmers not to fall in the trap of the politically-motivated leaders.

Jaipur: The state agriculture department has announced 100% subsidy on chemicals used to kill locusts in western Rajasthan districts.

The move comes after CM Ashok Gehlot held a review meeting last week. The department has now initiated a survey of agricultural areas to assess crop loss due to locust menace.

“The chemicals are free for farmers to counter the spread of locust from their fields and region. Earlier, the subsidy was 50%. Considering the prolonged period of locust menace, the decision has been taken to provide relief to farmers,” said Om Prakash, commissioner, agriculture department. The subsidy will be given to farmers in western districts like Barmer, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Western Jodhpur, Sirohi and Pali.

The first attack by locust was recorded on May 23 and threat continues till date. This is for the first time that threat of locust, which generally remains from May to October, has extended till date.

Vellore: A male elephant was electrocuted after stepping on an electric fence allegedly erected by poachers to hunt wild animals on revenue land at DB Palayam near Gudiyatham . The spot was near the Paradarami reserve forest on the Tamil Nadu-Andhra Pradesh border on Tuesday.

Forest department officials said the 30-year-old wild tusker was electrocuted while returning to the forest after barging into private land located between the reserve forest and the government revenue land in DB Palayam.

C Mahendran, Gudiyatham forest range officer, said, “To hunt animals like wild boars and deer, poachers in the area fix electric traps. They sell the meat illegally.”

On Tuesday, farmers who were taking their livestock for grazing, were surprised to notice the carcass of the elephant on the revenue land and alerted the Paradarami police station. Following information by police, forest officials from both Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh reached DB Palayam and conducted postmortem examination of the pachyderm in the presence of Vellore collector A Shanmuga Sundaram and district forest officer Bhargav Teja. Speaking to TOI, Shanmuga Sundaram said that following recent incidents of wild elephants from the reserve forest in Andhra Pradesh straying into villages in Vellore district, the administration had stepped up measures to construct elephant trenches.

Stringent action will be taken against the poachers involved in hunting of wild animals, the collector said.

Michael Lobo

PANAJI: Science and technology minister Michael Lobo has said the drug menace in the state seems to be “going out of hand” and chief minister Pramod Sawant must immediately set up a dedicated team to check its spread.

“This is a serious issue and steps need to be taken to contain it. The chief minister should take stock of the situation,” Lobo, who is a BJP MLA from the tourist beach belt of Calangute , told TOI.

He said though the coastal belt was always known for its drug problems, “currently, it looks like the situation is going out of hand”.

Lobo said though the situation was grave, it was not uncontrollable. “To control it, we will need to have a dedicated team with the chief minister monitoring its progress on a regular basis,” he said.

Pointing to the 2017 decision of Manohar Parrikar , after he became the chief minister, of setting up a special squad of senior police officials reporting directly to him, Lobo said he would be meeting Sawant soon to discuss this issue.

“I will request the chief minister to revive this special team which Parrikar had set up to control drug trade. Or else, even local people will meet the same fate as that of the three tourists,” he warned.

During the three-day electronic dance music (EDM) festival that ended on Sunday, two tourists from Andhra Pradesh and one from Telengana died under suspicious circumstances.

Though police have said the cause of their deaths are “reserved”, senior BJP functionaries and opposition have attacked the Sawant-led government for its inability to control drug menace.

The cause of death of three young men, Lobo said, could have been due to consumption of “spurious drugs”.

Police have said all three deaths have one thing in common — “cerebral and pulmonary edema”.

Doctors said those who overdose on drugs run a higher risk of cerebral and pulmonary edema.

“Mostly, persons who abuse substances or suffer a head injury on being hit by a heavy object suffer from cerebral edema,” a government doctor had said. But he said there were “absolutely no injuries” on the bodies of the three youths.

In August, TOI in a series of reports had exposed the dark alleys of Goa’s drug trade and Sawant, who had initially shrugged it off, was finally forced to admit the menace after his own MLAs agreed with the reports about easy availability of drugs in the state.

Lobo also slammed Goa police for failing to check drug menace in the state and said the anti-narcotics cell (ANC) was “not doing the job properly”.

“They aren’t going after the drug dealers. Mostly, it is the peddlers who are arrested,” he said.

“Tell me, how many big raids have been conducted by ANC... we have a narcotics control bureau (NCB) office here. How many raids has it conducted?” Lobo said.

“People should remain aware about health of their infants. They need to take immediate decision for getting clinical support, if the infant is unwell to save his life,” he said, adding that it is painful if an infant dies.

Sharma said if anyone was found guilty of negligence in the report of investigating team in the deaths of children in JK Lon Hospital in Kota, strict action would be taken against him.

Sharma criticised the previous BJP government for not installing centralised oxygen system in every hospital, including Kota’s JK Lon.

He, however, claimed that infant mortality rate (IMR) in the state had taken a significant dip. It was 7.62 per cent during BJP’s tenure in 2014, which has now been reduced to 5.55 per cent in 2019.

“They (BJP) themselves did not do anything. The IMR during their term was much higher, whereas we have reduced IMR and Maternal Mortality Ratio. We are bringing in more facilities in hospitals across the state. The government has focused majorly on the health sector,” he said.

Sharma said the state government's aim was to open medical colleges in all the 33 districts and the government was working very systematically in this sector.

Vellore: A team of medical experts at Christian Medical College ( CMC ) in Vellore has performed a life-saving surgery ( thoracic aortic aneurysm ) on a 58-year-old impoverished daily wager free of cost .

The surgery, which costs up to Rs 6 lakh, was performed at the CMC through funds raised by the hospital development department.

Thoracic aortic aneurysm is an abnormal bulge in the wall of a major blood vessel (aorta) that carries blood from the heart.

Addressing a press meet at the hospital, Prabhu Premkumar, professor of vascular surgery, said, “Singh, a daily wage labourer from Walajapet in Ranipet district was on December 20 admitted to the CMC emergency ward with complaints of vomiting blood. Singh, who was at once shifted to the department of gastroenterology for a CT scan, was diagnosed with the thoracic aortic aneursym and was immediately referred to the vascular surgery department.”

“As Singh was the sole breadwinner from a poor background and could not afford the treatment expenses and given the urgency of the condition, the hospital administration arranged a stent free of cost and successfully performed the operation on December 21.”

Singh is undergoing treatment free of cost and is on the road to recovery, Premkumar said.

Speaking to TOI, Durai Jasper, public relations officer of CMC, said, “The development department of the hospital facilitates treatment for poor patients from the local community who are in need of emergency life-saving treatment using funds raised through the department.”

The court directed the authorities concerned to promote the petitioner, D Jeyaseelan Koilraj Mathew, who is working as SI at the CID security branch in Chennai, to inspector of police within eight weeks.

Justice M S Ramesh observed that in 2016 the court had quashed disciplinary proceedings against one of the co-delinquent, V S Illangovan.

The judge noted that the order has also been confirmed in the appeal by this court in 2019.

“It is not in dispute that the charges levelled against Illangovan is similar to that of the petitioner arises out of the same occurrence. While the court had concluded the disciplinary proceeding against a co-delinquent on the ground of inordinate delay, this court is unable to take a different view in the case of the petitioner,” observed the judge. The judge cited that although the disciplinary proceeding initiated against the petitioner in 2007 is yet to conclude, it would not be appropriate to subject the petitioner to departmental proceedings after all these years.

Disciplinary proceeding was initiated against the petitioner as he had misused his official capacity and brutally attacked three people.

Disciplinary proceeding was initiated against four other co-delinquents in connection with the incident and a criminal case was also registered in 2014. Although the petitioner was entitled to be included in the promotion panel in 2012, the same was rejected on the ground that criminal proceeding was pending against him.

The criminal case against the petitioner was quashed in 2018. After the criminal case was quashed, the petitioner sought for promotion and the same was turned down though proceedings dated February 25, stating that he was not eligible for promotion as departmental proceeding is pending against him.

The judge observed that it was the submission of the additional government pleader that they have filed a review petition challenging the order passed in the appeal in 2019.

The judge noted that it is needless to point out that if the authorities concerned obtain a favourable order in the review petition, it is open to them to workout their remedies in accordance with law. Hence, the judge set aside the order dated February 25.

272,['1/01/2020'],Kasba residents on high alert a day after liquor shop robbery,"The Shantipally area where residents have started increasing security at their houses

KOLKATA: The robbery at a liquor shop located on the EM Bypass Rashbehari Connector at Shantipally’s Sarat Park in Kasba has not only surprised the cops for the sheer audacity of the accused, it has also left locals panicked. Witness to several petty crimes when the area came in to prominence almost a decade ago (one of the first areas of Kasba to get developed), residents of Shantipally said the past half-decade had mostly been incident-free. The fresh incident, coming a couple of days before the New Year, has left many wondering if they need to increase security at their shops and flats.“We have been staying here for two decades. We could not even hear a sound on Monday morning. But when I woke up in the morning, there were police all around. I stay with my wife alone. Though I own nothing that can attract a criminal , every crime reported right next to my home makes me nervous. I am planning to increase security of my house by installing CCTV cameras,” said 71-year-old Amitabha Chowdhury who stays on the flat located right next to the shop.Mitali Sarkar, a resident of the same flat where the shop is located, said: “The whole night, they keep unloading liquor crates. Around 4am, I heard a loud noise and got up thinking they were stocking up for the New Year. I came to the balcony to check. But the noise then stopped and I decided to go back to bed. I woke up when cops rang my calling bell and wanted to know about the owner.”“I cannot believe that someone can break the shutter, one inch of glass and a burglar alarm to commit the robbery. Barely metres away, a restaurant operates late in to the night and there is 24-hour security at the hotel located right opposite the road. This incident thus raises question on our prevalent security system. But then this has been a peaceful neighbourhood and the cops had almost managed to nab them before they fled. I am certain this will remain an one-off incident,” said Sarkar.Sanjay Varma, a local businessman staying at the BA block located right behind the shop, said that the narrow alley that opens up to the Bypass (right beside the shop) often gets unwanted visitors at night. “On occasions, rogue bikers come and drink here and throw away the bottles. But this happens only on festive occasions. Otherwise, the area is peaceful. Being a businessman residing here, I am a bit worried. I have already ensured that the CCTV outside my residence is working,” said Varma.Police said they were investigating the case with the belief that the gang had at least one local resident who acted as their eyes and ears. “The detective department and Kasba police have leads on the Rs 2.7 lakh robbery. We will crack this case soon,” said an investigating officer at Lalbazar. The owner of the shop has refused to comment.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73053953,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-726708,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kasba-residents-on-high-alert-a-day-after-liquor-shop-robbery/articleshow/73052248.cms

277,['1/01/2020'],"Researcher scripts Chaudhari proverbs, riddles in a book","This story is from January 1, 2020

Vadodara: ‘Khede tiyaay fuy’ is the commonly used proverb to explain land reforms in the tribal Chaudhari community in Surat and Tapi districts. The proverb that roughly translates as ‘land to the tiller’ got popularized when land reforms were introduced by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

Some 395 proverbs like this, which would have otherwise become extinct, have, for the first time been compiled and published as a book. A professor of Gujarati literature Vikram Chaudhari has come out with the book having not only list of proverbs but also 174 riddles of the Chaudhari language.

“There is a population of five to six lakh people in Chaudhari community but the language is among those Indian languages that may get extinct. This book will help in not only protecting but also conserving the language,” said Chaudhari. He is a professor of Gujarati at an arts and commerce college in Bardoli in Surat district.

Chaudhari said that proverbs and riddles that have travelled over generations within the community highlight the history and culture. “The proverbs and riddles are about the culture, struggle, lifestyle, celebrations, nature, agricultural methods of the community,” he added.

The language’s prominence among the younger generation is slowly decreasing as other languages like Hindi and English are being widely used. Giving an example of it, Chaudhari said that after the book was unveiled, it was shared to youth of the community. “But many of them were unaware about these proverbs. I saw them asking their grandparents what the proverbs and riddles meant,” Chaudhari said.

He believes that the book will act as a bridge between the younger generation and the language.

PANAJI: The 2,400 tonnes of naphtha stored at Ganesh Benzoplast left Mormugao Port at 11.36pm on Tuesday, said South Goa collector Ajit Roy. The chemical is being shifted out of India by MT Global Peak to the Gulf at not cost to the state. It was initially aboard the grounded vessel Nu-Shi Nalini, off Dona Paula.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the vessel and naphtha has been cleared “without spending a single paise from the state treasury within one and a half month”. The chief minister had initially said the state government was searching for a new vessel to transport the naphtha that it would not be transported by road.

“I reiterate that the safety and well-being of Goans is our top priority and our government remains committed to protecting the interest of Goa,” Sawant said.

The high court of Bombay at Goa made it clear in its order that the entire responsibility of ensuring safety at the tanks storing naphtha from the ill-fated Nu Shi Nalini will be that of Ganesh Benzoplast in the first instance and MPT in the second instance.

After it came on record that Ganesh Benzoplast is storing naphtha at Vasco without consent to operate from the Goa Pollution Control Board, the high court had observed that it is “virtually holding a gun to the entire state”.

Congress had submitted a memorandum demanding a high-level inquiry on the grounded vessel Nu-Shi Nalini carrying highly explosive naphtha from Pakistan at Mormugao Port Trust. Congress had also demanded that naphtha not be transported through tankers.

On October 24, due to strong winds and cyclone Kyarr, chemical tanker Nu-Shi Nalini drifted from outer anchorage and ran aground near Dona Paula.

Nearly a month later, on November 21, Marine Masters B V was given the job of salvaging the vessel. The naphtha aboard the vessel has already been sold to a Baroda-based firm that emerged as the highest bidder in the auction process.

MSTC (a government of India’s public-sector unit, earlier known as Metal Scrap Trade Corporation Ltd) conducted the auction through online bidding.

280,['1/01/2020'],Education minister meets West Bengal governor at Raj Bhavan,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Jagdeep Dhankhar (Photo: ANI)

KOLKATA: The state education minister has finally called on the West Bengal governor on the last day of the year, throwing up signs of a let up in the continuing battle of nerves between the government and the constitutional head of the state.

Education minister Partha Chatterjee is the first minister in the Mamata Banerjee cabinet to have paid a visit to Raj Bhavan on Tuesday, five months after Jagdeep Dhankhar took office as governor of West Bengal in July 2019. Chatterjee did it after the chief minister forwarded a letter from the governor on education matters to the minister with a direction “to discuss all the issues at a convenient time”.

The minister’s visit came nearly a fortnight after chief secretary and director general of police called on the governor at Raj Bhavan.

The governor was probably waiting for the meeting to build bridges with the government.

“Had extremely involved pleasant and cordial meeting with Partha Chatterjee, the honourable education minister. Best wishes for 2020 for the honourable chief minister and all the members,” Dhankhar tweeted after the meeting. The governor also told the minister that he wanted to visit the cyclone-hit districts in 2020. The governor also put his signature on the West Bengal Municipal (Amendment) Bill, lying with him after being passed in the Assembly.

Neither the governor nor the education minister did divulge the details of the discussion and how the governor’s concern over the running of the state universities was addressed by the minister.

Chatterjee only indicated after the meeting that the state government didn’t like the way the governor has been using his twitter handle on various issues and has recently uploaded the CM’s letter addressed to him. “I requested the governor against making comments in the social media too often,” Chatterjee said.

This apart, the governor “embarrassed” the government by making tweets on each and every occasion he met with hurdles. The governor also told the media that he has to use the ‘ Didi ke Bolo ’ platform to call attention of the chief minister to sit with him and carve out the development path for the state.

The governor wants to make a “fresh start” from New Year though the flashpoints in the “walking together” remain. The governor in his New Year message has made certain points such as “abrogation of Article 370 is epochal”, “Lok Sabha elections signalled political stability in a row” that the chief minister may not agree to.

The governor, who is the chancellor of state universities, was peeved with “the temples of education in political cage”. The governor’s remarks fueled similar reactions in Trinamool ranks while ministers kept blaming the governor for his taking a partisan stand.

The state education minister told the governor’s not being able to attend the Jadavpur University convocation programme was “unfortunate” but didn’t give indications of taking back the new university rules that plugs any direct communication between the governor and the vice-chancellor.

Political observers would rather wait till January 13 and see the outcome of the governor’s calling a meeting of the vice-chancellors in presence of the education before they conclude that things have started looking up.

Nashik: A four-year-old male leopard was killed in an accident after being knocked down by a speeding vehicle on the Nashik-Pune highway in Sangamner taluka of Ahmednagar district.

The incident took place at around 6.45 pm on Monday at the Saraldhavawadi village, near Chandanapuri ghat in the Sangamner taluka.

On receiving the information, forest department officials immediately rushed to the spot. They then sent the animal’s body for post-mortem. The body was subsequently cremated on Tuesday.

Nashik: House break-ins continued to be the thorn in the city police’s side 2019. The number of house break-ins in 2019 almost matched the number in 2018, showing that the police were unable to bring this category of offence under control.

However, controlling street robberies proved to be even harder, as the number of chain-snatchings and robberies, in general, went up in 2019 in comparison to the previous year. On a brighter note, there were fewer murders and road deaths in 2019.

Over the past year, the city has seen some grievous crimes, including the murder of a trader in Indiranagar and the murder of an IT engineer during an armed dacoity attempt at Muthoot among others. The police were praised by all quarters for their swift action in nabbing the culprits involved.

However, offences like robberies, house break-ins, vehicle thefts, thefts etc continued unabated despite strict policing planned with the aim to increase police visibility on the city streets.

In 2018, there were 254 house break-in cases registered in the city. In 2019, the police had registered 255 cases till December 29.

Further, as against 71 chain-snatchings registered in 2018, in 2019, there were 87 chain-snatching cases. Other robberies too increased to 147 in 2019, up from 139 in 2018.

Police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil said, “Thefts and robberies are a menace and the police personnel are doing everything in their capacity to control them. Since the beginning of the year, we have been appealing to the people to deploy security guards and set up surveillance cameras on their respective premises to prevent robberies and thefts. Now we have also decided to come out with a notification to make it compulsory for all private entities to take security measures at their own level that would safeguard life and property.”

The police commissioner also said that soon, under the Smart City project, Nashik would get as many as 800 CCTV cameras. After the camera network is installed, the menace of thefts and robberies would come under control, he said.

Meanwhile, there were fewer murders in 2019 when compared to the crime data of 2018. According to the police data in 2019, there were a total 23 murder cases registered in the city. A year prior to that, the total figure of murders in the city stood at 35.

Senior police officials attributed this drop in number of murder cases to the large-scale externment of criminals that were effected in 2019. Police officers said that 2019 saw externment of 136 criminals. Further, Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) Act was invoked upon 12 criminals.

Fatal accidents too dropped by almost 24%. Police officials said that from the beginning of the year, they have been insisting on people wearing helmets. By the end of the year, 90% of the bikers are seen wearing helmets. The police presence on the city streets — to take action against erring motorists and bikers not wearing helmets — has resulted in cases of causing death due to negligence to 176 from 2018’s 230 cases, said the police data.

Vadodara: It was the usual festivities on New Year’s Eve where Barodians welcomed the new decade amid music and fireworks on Tuesday midnight.

With many party plots and hotels hosting disco and musical nights on the occasion, revellers had multiple options to shake a leg even amid the biting cold.

All the roads led to the farmhouses on the outskirts of the city where the private parties were organized. But the cops were ready to nab anybody flouting prohibition laws and had deployed stringent security across the city. It also conducted checking of party revellers for drunk driving.

285,['1/01/2020'],Madras HC sets aside dismissal of co-operative society employee,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Representative image

MADURAI: Setting aside the dismissal order of a saleswoman at a co-operative society, the Madras high court directed the authorities concerned to reinstate the petitioner, who was dismissed on charges of misappropriation, citing that the co-delinquent in the case was reinstated back in service based on the earlier order of this court.

The petitioner, Jeyachitra, and another woman Sheela Devi were working as sales women at the Pullampadi primary agricultural cooperative credit society (PACCS) limited in Trichy. They were placed under suspension for misappropriation from the cooperative society and a criminal case was also registered against them in 2016.

Following these charges, the president of the society imposed a punishment of stoppage of increment for one year on the duo. After remitting back the amount which was misappropriated, the petitioner submitted a representation to the authorities concerned seeking to revoke her suspension. However, an order dated June 16, 2017, dismissed her from service. In the meantime, both were acquitted from the criminal case by a lower court.

On perusal of submissions made by either side, Justice M S Ramesh observed that since Sheela was reinstated by a court order in 2018, the same would squarely apply for the petitioner.

“Originally the petitioner was imposed with the punishment of stoppage of increment for the period of one year and subsequently the order of dismissal was passed. A perusal of the dismissal order does not reveal the fact that the earlier punishment of stoppage of increment for a period of one year was recalled or set aside. Without doing so, the petitioner cannot be subjected to two punishments and the same is illegal,” observed the judge.

Hence, the judge set aside the dismissal order and directed the authorities concerned to reinstate the petitioner to service with all consequential and monetary benefits.

Hyderabad: Telangana lost 155 sq km of tree cover, as per the data presented in the Indian State of Forest Report 2019 compared to the last assessment in 2017. This figure represents trees occurring in patches of less than one hectare, including scattered trees. The report however stated that the state has gained forest cover to the tune of 163.31 sq km.

The report presented on Monday comes in the backdrop of repeated protests by city-based activists and environmentalists against the felling of trees across the state for various projects. The report says the state’s tree cover stands at 2,514 sq km.

The forest cover for the state stands at 20,582.31 sq km, which is 18.36 per cent of the state’s geographical area, said the report. Forest cover represents trees spread over more than one hectare with a tree canopy density of more than 10 per cent. The report said that the main reasons for this are “plantation and conservation activities as well as improvement in interpretation”.

Among the districts, Adilabad has 35.53 per cent forest cover in proportion to its geographical area, the report said. Followed by Khammam with 33.76 per cent, and Warangal with 22.99 per cent. The worst performing districts were Nalgonda with 2.91 per cent, Medak with 7.62 per cent and Hyderabad with 8.61 per cent. Medak was the only district to see a loss of forest cover from the previous assessment to the tune of 6.69 sq km.

The figures are based on the interpretation of IRS Resourcesat-2 LISS III satellite data of the period November 2017 to January 2018.

Among trees outside forests in urban spaces, Neem had maximum presence with 18.94 per cent, followed by Mango trees at 8.84 per cent and Leucaena leucocephala 7.04 per cent. Mango trees had the most presence in rural areas (41.63 per cent). Among invasive species, Lantana camara had the maximum spread of 259 sq km.

Madurai: Madurai Municipal Corporation is planning to conduct fairs and exhibitions at a vacant land between MGR bus terminal and the flower market at Mattuthavani as an alternative to Thamukkam ground where a convention centre spending Rs 46 crore is coming up.

Officials said that there is a land measuring more than five acres lying vacant next to the truck parking space at Mattuthavani.

The convention centre, which was recently proposed by the corporation, has obtained all clearances from the required agencies. Preliminary works on preparing tender documents are on. Officials expressed confidence that the tender process can be finalized in a couple of months, and start the work in March or April. “However, it may get delayed if election to the urban local bodies is announced in between,” a corporation official said.

It will take 18 to 24 months to finish the construction work. Once the work is started, the rest of the space on the ground will not be available to conduct exhibitions and fairs including the annual Chithirai festival, which used to be conducted in April, he added.

Another official said that the vacant space is sufficient and is a viable option to conduct fairs and exhibitions. It is easy to access from the main road and is well connected by public transportation system with the rest of the city. Its only flip side is its location. Compared to the Thamukkam, which is located in the heart of the city, Mattuthavani is located in one corner of the city, he said.

Officials have promised that the convention centre is planned in less than four acres and a part of land measuring 5.6 acres will be left untouched, where Chithirai festival and other fairs can be organized normally.

VADODARA: A resident of Manjalpur was booked for cheating a bakery owner by subletting his mini bus and not paying him rent for five months.

The complainant Mahendra Vaishnav had rented out his minibus to the Ashwin Patel in July 2017 for a monthly rent of Rs 23,000 through a friend. Vaishnav had bought the used mini bus from a man in Anand in January. According to the agreement between Vaishnav and Patel, the latter was to pay him the rent before 10th day of each month.

In July, Patel paid him Rs 10,000 as advance and later gave Rs 22,000 as July’s rent. After that, he then stopped paying rent to Vaishnav. “Whenever the Vaishnav asked for rent money, he would make some or the other excuse and kept dilly-dallying,” said a police official.

Around a fortnight back, when Vaishnav again contacted him for rent, Patel flatly refused to pay and told him that he had let out the mini bus to some other person in Godhra . Vaishnav stated in his complaint that Patel even told him to go ahead and lodge a police complaint as he is not afraid of the law.

Even then when Vaishnav did not get his money, he lodged a complaint based on which an FIR was registered against Patel at Makarpura police station on Monday.

A signboard displaying the new speed limit imposed on vehicles plying on the bridge

KOLKATA: The state public works department ( PWD ) is gearing up to start dismantling the Tallah Bridge from January 5. They have planned to close the bridge from January 3 night. Around Rs 2 crore will be spent to demolish the bridge.

It has been decided at the meeting, held by PWD director and several transport operators , on Monday that the autos plying on Tallah Bridge will be asked to follow original routes. They will not be able to take the new routes decided for the buses.

Light and small vehicles have the options of three different routes like Belgachhia bridge , Chitpore Lock Gate and Khagen Chatterjee Road-Cossipore Road.

The buses of 15 different routes, which used to ply on the Tallah Bridge, will follow a simpler diversion pattern now. Most of these buses, except for the ones on four routes, will use Belgachhia bridge to move towards the south. They will be diverted through Chitpore Lock Gate while returning.

However, the present bus services via Belgachhia bridge will remain unaffected. A few buses that have already been diverted towards EM Bypass will continue to follow the diversion.

After the Tallah Bridge’s structure was found to be in a dangerous state, the government had announced on September 28 the ban on vehicles having gross weight of over 3 tonnes to move on the bridge. Heavy vehicles stopped plying on the bridge from the next day.

VADODARA: An 11-year-old girl in Tarsali area died from dengue at the state-run SSG Hospital (SSGH) on December 11, confirmed the results of the dengue tests conducted on her which were furnished to the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) on Tuesday. This is the first death due from the vector-borne disease this year after dengue kept the city in its grip in 2019.

Ruchita Bariya’s blood sample report which came posthumously confirmed her death as due to dengue virus . VMC officials said that Ruchita died from dengue shock syndrome with multiorgan failure.

The city registered 6,153 suspected dengue cases in 2019, of which 1,269 were confirmed as dengue. The total number of cases reported in 2016 was 1,514.

VMC officials, however, said that the number of deaths could be considered on the lower side. “In 2016, 14 persons had died due to dengue. This year, the symptoms of the disease were much milder. Physicians managed to treat some patients even without admitting them in hospitals,” said an official.

A concern, however, is that several private hospitals treated dengue patients after performing the rapid card test for dengue.

The civic body is considering such private treatment as well as indicative tests not confirmatory. Officials confirm a dengue case only if the ELISA test is positive for the NS1 antigen and IgM antibodies. This had led to around 10 unconfirmed dengue deaths in the city during the year.

300,['1/01/2020'],‘Scrapping quota from Parliament &amp; House is discriminatory’,"This story is from January 1, 2020

LUCKNOW: Members of Anglo-Indian community in the city on Tuesday termed the government’s move to scrap provision of nomination to the community in Lok Sabha and state assemblies as “discriminatory” and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath to reconsider the decision.

They said the Constitution (126th) Amendment Bill, ratified by the UP Assembly, provides extension of reservation for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes for 10 years but scraps special provision of nominating Anglo-Indian members to Lok Sabha and state legislatures.

This means the community will not get benefit of the provision in legislature bodies formed after January 25, 2020.

The term Anglo-Indian can be referred to at least two groups of people – those with mixed Indian and British ancestry and people of British/English descent born or living in India.

Many Anglo-Indian families are living in India for four-five generations and decided to live in the country of their birth after Independence. Seats were reserved for the community in legislatures so that they can get a platform to air their grievances.

Errol Serpis, a 68-year-old retired professional, told TOI: “India is our motherland. We have been loyal to the country and contributed in its development. Abolishing seats will be an injustice to the community.”

“We also contributed in the freedom struggle. The government should acknowledge our needs as it is doing in case of SC/ST category,” he said.

Former president of All India Anglo-Indian Association, Lucknow chapter, Clifford Bond said the government should not scrap the provision. “The community has left an indelible mark in the annals of history of our country as officers in the Indian Air Force, Navy, Army and education. A lot remains to be done for those who are still fighting odds and need assistance and opportunity. We don’t belong to a particular caste, we have been true Indians,” said Bond.

Denzil Godin, nominated member from the community in the state assembly, had on Saturday said: “We are over 50,000 in number across the state and around 300 in Lucknow. As we have no specific provision in the Census form since 1951, the numbers quoted by the government to justify its decision to scrap the special provision for Anglo-Indians is wrong.”

Gordin, who has also written to UP CM and the Governor, to reconsider the decision, said opposition parties were not informed about this move when the Bill was tabled in the Assembly for ratification.

VADODARA: Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) medical officer, Dr Devesh Patel , has landed in a major controversy after he was named as an accused in a US visa cheating case registered at the Kamrej police station in Surat district .

The top official has been accused of accepting money on behalf of the mastermind in the case.

The offence was registered by a resident of Patel Faliya in Kamrej, Nayna Patel who said she was seeking for a visa for her daughter Henal either to the USA or Canada. Patel was then directed to one Manish Patel by a friend.

Henal held a master’s degree in pharmacy and Manish Patel promised the complainant that her daughter would get a job in the US and should therefore migrate to the country. He also claimed that he had a placement agency in Delhi and allegedly told the complainant that she would have to pay Rs 25 lakh as fees. The woman agreed to pay the amount but said that she would pay it in instalments only.

Patel later asked her to consider sending her son Priyank too to the US as someone he knew there was looking to employ youths. The complainant agreed to this offer and between May 25, 2018, to February 17, 2019, she paid Rs 45lakh for the two visas. However, it never got through. The money was not transferred through banks but using ‘angadiyas’ and even as cash payments.

The SMC official got entangled in the issue after he allegedly received Rs 5 lakh through ‘angadiya’ which was meant for Manish. Two others, Krunal Pravinbhai and Urmit Patel, had also received money in a similar fashion and were named in the FIR along with Manish and Dr Devesh Patel.

According to the doctor, he knew Manish since childhood as they belonged to the same village. “I have nothing to do with the case and do not know the complainant either. I came to know about the offence only on Monday. It seems that my relationship with him along with he reputation I have is being used to blackmail me,” he added.

HYDERABAD: A 37-year-old woman attempted suicide by setting herself ablaze at Punjagutta police station on Tuesday evening. The woman, who was from Chennai, suffered critical burns. Police said that she was dejected with the behaviour of a 51-year-old mining businessman from the city who she was in love with and, so, resorted to the extreme step.

“Lokeshwari had married a man named Srinivas in 2000. When their daughter was eight-months-old, Srinivas left her,” said Punjagutta ACP Tirupatanna. Her daughter is now 16-years-old.

In 2012, Lokeshwari, a resident of Chennai, met Praveen Kumar, from Bapanna Basti, in Warasiguda, while on a trip to Tirupati. “In 2013, Praveen Kumar had set up a jewellery store in Somajiguda and appointed Lokeshwari as its manager. They were living together in BS Maqta,” said the ACP.

In 2014, Praveen lodged a complaint against Lokeshwari alleging that she stole 23.5 tola gold from the shop. Lokeshwari was arrested and later acquitted.

Lokeshwari then moved back to Chennai. Recently, Lokeshwari tried to contact Praveen who avoided her.

On Friday, Lokeshwari and her landlord, Kannan came to Hyderabad in search of Praveen and checked into a lodge at Nampally.

“On Tuesday evening, Lokeshwari wrote a letter addressing ACP Punjagutta alleging that Praveen Kumar had duped her of Rs 1 crore. She asked Kannan to hold the letter and walked to the police station. She then doused herself with petrol and set herself ablaze,” West Zone DCP A R Srinivas said.

Engulfed in flames, Lokeshwari ran into the police station. Cops doused the flames and rushed her to NIMS hospital. As she had sustained severe burns she was moved to Osmania General Hospital. “Kannan said that Lokeshwari brought him to Hyderabad saying that she has to collect Rs 50 lakh from Praveen. She suffered 78 per cent burns. Her dying declaration is being recorded. We are trying to trace Praveen,” the ACP said.

Lokeshwari had purchased petrol from a filling station in Nampally saying that her scooter stopped in the middle of the road. She showed her Aadhar card to make the purchase, the ACP said.

Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar

HYDERABAD: Congress on Tuesday petitioned governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, urging her to order an inquiry against Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar for his high-handed behaviour and denial of permission to take out ‘Save India, save Constitution’ rally in protest against CAA, NPR and NRC on December 28.

“Police gave permission to lathi-wielding RSS members to march on the roads. Consent was given to MIM public meeting in Darussalam. But, police not only denied permission to our rally but also arrested hundreds of party workers. Is Congress a banned organisation or an illegal outfit?” Telangana Congress president and Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy said.

A delegation of Congress members comprising Uttam, working president A Revanth Reddy, former minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir, among others, submitted a memorandum to the governor. “There are allegations of corruption and misconduct against Anjani, which needs to be probes,” Uttam said.

Uttam added that all complaints received against Anjani would be forwarded to authorities once an enquiry is ordered. Congress leaders urged the governor to exercise special powers under section 8 of AP Bifurcation Act 2014 and take action against Anjani.

After bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, Anjani was allocated Andhra state cadre but he continues to serve in Telangana by obtaining a stay order from court. “Has KCR not found an IPS officer from Telangana cadre who is fit enough to head Hyderabad police force? Anjani is doing chamchagiri of the ruling TRS,” Uttam alleged.

304,['1/01/2020'],Invasive species increasing in Kerala’s core forest areas,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Kochi: More than 1,000 invasive species have been identified in the core rainforests of Kerala , according to the latest forest survey report 2019. The common species are chromolaena odorata (siam weed), lantana camara (lantana), ageratum conyzoides (goat weed), ageratina adenophora (sticky snakeroot) and mikania micrantha (Chinese creeper).

Scientists say that the first impact is the displacement of endemic species. “The invasive species can establish themselves faster than the local ones because they are sturdier,” said T V Sajeev, senior scientist, department of forest entomology, Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI).

He said that during landslides the top layer of soil slips, which helps the invasive species. “Immediately, the invasive species establish themselves. In canopies, even in a tree branch falls, the invaders occupy the space created,” he said.

Most of these species come into the core forests through what are called linear intrusions by way of roads, electric poles, wiring, etc. “Yet another form is wind pollination where the seeds disburse very fast and in large numbers. There is also a phenomenon of the giant trees being replaced in case they fall. The endemic species are slow to grow while the invasive ones just take over, occupying even the minute space available in the forest,” Sajeev said.

These would soon change the character of the tropical rainforests which are the source of intense rainfall in the state.

People protest against CAA near Alundur court in Chennai (File Photo)

CHENNAI: PMK, an ally of the ruling AIADMK and BJP, on Tuesday passed a resolution at its general council meeting in Tindivanam, urging the Centre and the state government not to undertake the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise in Tamil Nadu. By opposing the NRC , the PMK has joined the ranks of other BJP allies - JD(U) and SAD - who are also against this exercise.

PMK youth wing leader and Rajya Sabha member Anbumani Ramadoss hadsupported the Centre’s Citizenship Amendment Bill in Parliament. The PMK has also been demanding that Lankan Tamils too should come under the ambit of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act as they were a “persecuted minority” in the island nation. In its current form, CAA only provides for citizenship to “persecuted minorities” in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. “Our state does not share its borders with any country and details of Sri Lankan refugees are already available with the government. Hence, there is no need to undertake NRC in Tamil Nadu, since the exercise will create unwanted fear among people,” the PMK resolution said, hinting that the National Population Register ( NPR ) exercise is itself being seen by many as a prelude to NRC.

On a mission to strengthen the party, through the recently formed ‘Brothers’ and ‘Sisters’ wings, PMK hopes to finalize its strategy for the 2021 assembly election.

“The AIADMK government is surviving solely because of our support. We gave them 22 seats for the byelections and ensured the government’s survival. But, AIADMK is not reciprocating the gesture,” said Anbumani at the meeting.

Anbumani, however, sought to downplay his speech on NRC, while addressing the media later. “AIADMK leadership is aware of this. I have not accused the ruling party, but only made a friendly request. This will not create any issue in our alliance with AIADMK,” he said. While adding that CAA is not against anyone and people have not fully understood it, he said it was “wrong”, if people were arrested for drawing ‘kolam’ against CAA.

At the meeting, Anbumani also hit out at DMK president M K Stalin for blaming the PMK for everything. “DMK has employed an agency by spending huge money to malign us as well as other political parties in the social media,” he said.

“In the recently held rural local body polls, AIADMK allocated seats to us piecemeal and we were forced to plead. While we aligned with them, after giving up our avowed principle against aligning with anyone, it hurts when we do not get due recognition,” he leader said.

“At least in the next round of local body polls, including the nine districts where the polls were not held, AIADMK should recognize us properly,” he lamented, while adding that his party will draw up its strategy for the 2021 assembly election soon, a PMK source, privy to the meeting, told TOI.

HYDERABAD: More skeletons are tumbling out of the multi-crore Insurance Medical Services ( IMS ) scam cupboard. ACB officials, who booked a third case against Omni Medi proprietor K Srihari Babu and arrested him, said he had invested Rs 130 crore ill-gotten money in shares and bank deposits.

ACB officials found that Srihari was floating a shell company Legend Enterprises with his associate Krupasagar Reddy as director. IMS joint director K Padma prepared indents to purchase medical kits to count white blood cells from a Swedish firm through Legend Enterprises.

Indents prepared by Padma were approved by IMS director Ch Devika Rani and purchase orders would be issued. “The accused did not make any purchases from the Swedish company. The accused transferred money into the accounts of Legend Enterprises by creating fake documents, including supply bills. From the accounts of Legend, money was routed to Srihari’s account. A part of this was given to Devika and Padma by Srihari,” said an ACB official.

“Srihari invested Rs 99 crore in stock market and Rs 31 crore as fixed deposits,” said an ACB source. Presently, Srihari stands as an accused in three IMS scam cases. Officials said that Srihari would be produced before court on Wednesday for judicial remand.

KOLKATA: West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) on Tuesday served a show-cause notice on Visva-Bharati , Santiniketan , threatening to impose on them Rs 10 lakh environmental compensation for alleged violation of three key issues at Poush Mela — stalls using coal-fired ovens, insufficient public toilets and amenities and absence of fire-fighting arrangements in all stalls.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) formed a three-member observer committee comprising former advocate general Jayanta Mitra, pollution control board chairman Kalyan Rudra and environment crusader Subhas Datta , who had moved NGT in 2016 against gross environmental pollution during Poush Mela. The committee identified these problems on December 24 and 25. Issued by the member secretary of WBPCB, Rajesh Kumar, the notice asked the VB registrar to explain why the environmental compensation should not be imposed on the university.

“My recent case particularly focussed on VB’s failure in managing waste,” said Datta.

The VB public relations officer, Anirban Sarkar, said, “We are yet to receive the notice. We have done everything to comply with the NGT order. WBPCB did not give us any guideline. We will give a reply after receiving the notice.”

Dignitaries at the meet organized by Institute of Town Planners, India, on Sunday

Nagpur: Policy-makers should concentrate on growth of walkable urban centres that are transit-free and bicycle-friendly for which a proper transportation system should be put in place by earmarking different lanes on wider roads and make commuting easy, said Swati Meshram, senior planner at California, USA, on Sunday.

She was delivering the keynote address on ‘Environment-friendly multimodal mobility — an experience of orange country, California, USA’, organized by the Nagpur chapter of Institute of Town Planners, India (ITPI) at its Trimurti Nagar Ring Road facility.

Swati, who is active in community development planning in California, said people in India drive two, three and four-wheelers on the same roads which causes bottlenecks in the system. In US, a large number of people use four-wheelers for daily commuting that reduces burden on roads.

Americans, she said, are promoting bicycles and bikes. This should be emulated in India too. It will be an ideal situation if transportation system is open to automobiles, pedestrians and cyclists too. For this, different lanes should be earmarked so that road users will not face problems while driving. ‘Smart growth’ will be possible if these factors are taken into account, she added.

Swati’s father DS Meshram, president of Institute of Town Planners, New Delhi, said giving importance to disciplined driving can solve 50% of transportation problems in India. People are not disciplined and are often seen parking vehicles in the areas meant for travelling. This causes hindrances in smooth flow of traffic, he added.

While streets are open to all, and not vehicle-friendly, roads are meant for different types of vehicles. If people understood the difference between the two, conditions might change for better, he said.

Chairman of the institute Sujit Rodge and treasurer Jagdish Rajurkar were seated on the dais. Secretary Pankaj Bahadure proposed a vote of thanks.

Aurangabad: City BJP chief Kishanchand Tanwani hit out at Shiv Sena for not wearing the traditional saffron headgear during the deputy mayor’s election on Tuesday and added that the party has changed its Hindutva ideology.

“Sena’s ideology has changed. They used to wear saffron phetas (headgear) in every election. Now that they have received support from Congress and NCP, they have ditched their tradition,” Tanwani told reporters following the election.

The deputy mayor election had to be held after BJP’s Vijay Autade resigned from the post earlier this month. The BJP had stated that the resignation was against the state government’s stay on Rs 1,680-crore water supply scheme of the state government.

The BJP sought letter from the state government stating that the stay has been lifted from the crucial water supply project.

Earlier, mayor Nandkumar Ghodele, a Sena corporator, had stated that the BJP’s desire for power hasn’t exhausted and if the letter was not received from the state government, why did they support the nominee for deputy mayor.

Tanwani said they supported a candidate because they did not want the election to be without opposition. “We could have given a tough fight to Sena but we did not do that because we wanted people of the city to know the truth,” he said.

Between 2005 and 2018, the state witnessed 38 instances of collision between crocodiles and vehicle on roads a... Read More

VADODARA: Gujarat is known to be a home to healthy breeding population of muggers. But the otherwise fearsome crocodiles are falling prey to fast-paced development of roads and railway in the state.

Crocodiles enjoy highest protection under the Wildlife (Protection Act) 1972, but a research paper on ‘Mugger crocodile mortality due to roads and railways in Gujarat’ has revealed a disturbing trend.

Between 2005 and 2018, the state witnessed 38 instances of collision between crocodiles and vehicle on roads and railway tracks, which resulted in death of 33 reptiles. Only five were treated and released in the wild again. Of these accidents, 24 happened on the roads while 14 on railway tracks.

“The trend is disturbing considering that there is a rise in number of collisions in the last decade,” said Anirudh Vasava, research coordinator at the Voluntary Nature Conservancy and member of the IUCN-SSC crocodile specialist group.

Also, juvenile and sub-adults (small crocodiles less than seven foot in size) were the ones which met with more accidents – 24 in all - compared to adults (crocodiles more than seven foot long) that met 14 such accidents.

Most of the crocodiles collide with heavy vehicles or trains during the months of monsoon (July to October) while the frequency of such accidents decreases in winter and summer.

“It is during the months of monsoon that babies get hatched. The female crocodiles and the juveniles start dispersing in search of newer and safer areas. But when they try to cross over these areas to reach connecting habitats, they meet with accidents,” he said.

Raju Vyas, the regional joint vice-chair of the IUCN/ SSC crocodile specialist group (South Asia and Iran), said, “Crocodile movement is high during nights when visibility of drivers is less. “For the reptiles, they are just doing a seasonal or food migration. But when they cross the roads or railway tracks, they get victimised. At times, they also get crushed due to fear or just for the sake of fun of the drivers.”

“The road and railway network is expected to expand further due to other proposed transportation projects like dedicated freight corridor and Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project. It is emerging as a threat to otherwise growing mugger population within the state,” said Vyas, who has been researching mugger crocodile for more than three decades in Gujarat.

NEW DELHI: To strengthen its frontline in deployment, Delhi Police is procuring over 5,000 bulletproof jackets for its personnel. The vests will not only be worn by the cops going on raids to catch criminals, but also by the front layer during riots and agitations. The move is being seen as a boost to the force’s ability to fight terrorists and organised crime.The department was expected to complete the procurement in a month, sources said. The jackets being bought are of III+ level and will protect Delhi cops from bullets fired from a range of weapons, such as AK rifles, sten machine guns, MP-5, carbine, etc.The new vests are each likely to cost Rs 1 lakh or above. This is more than double the price of older vests, which cost Rs 40,000. Police commissioner Amulya Patnaik is closely following the procurements.Police sources say the jackets will comply with the American National Institute of Justice standard , taken into consideration by the world’s top forces. At present, the Delhi Police has roughly 2,500 bullet-resistant jackets across units in difference categories. There has been a long-standing demand from the personnel for additional jackets.According to sources, the level III+ armour also has the ability to resist bullets of .357 bore and soft armour piercing rounds, including 7.62x39mm steel-core bullets used in AK series rifles and 7.62x51mm battle rifle rounds used in sniper rifles.Delhi Police has been trying on these jackets for the past two years. Sources say before procurement, the jackets must clear the test parameters fixed by Bureau of Police Research and Development and the police modernisation division of home ministry.Apart from bullets, the jackets will also be able to stop stabs from Swiss knives or ice-picks. As per the specifications of the level-III armour, these jackets will be made of several layers of Kevlar sheets and metallic plates. It will protect the chest, back, ribs, groin and neck and weigh less than 2.5kg, a standard for all kinds of armour.Explaining the features of the new jackets, an officer said the vests would be abrasion-proof, water- and fireproof and treated for protection against ultraviolet ray exposure. The jackets will also be available in extra large sizes, apart from large and standard.Many of the jackets Delhi Police had till a few years ago were not just outdated but were also heavy, weighing around 11kg a piece, an officer recalled, adding that it was extremely difficult to keep them on for hours. In 2013, a Delhi court had expressed concerns at the city’s ill-equipped policemen after which the force began efforts to procure bulletproof jackets for its top-rank officers, those engaged in patrolling and on law and order duty, and commandos handling riots and terror attacks.The absence of bulletproof jackets, or their poor quality, has been the bane of Indian police forces for long.

LUCKNOW: Amid an intensifying cold wave, the minimum temperature in the city touched 0.7 degree Celsius, seven notches below normal, making Tuesday the second-most coldest December day in 67 years, precisely since 1952 when the UP Met office was set up in the state capital.Lucknow had recorded the same minimum temperature on December 29, 2012, which makes Tuesday’s reading a new seven-year low. An all-time December low of 0.5 degree Celsius was recorded on 30th of the month in 1973. The current minimum in the city is lower than Shimla (1.2°C), Jammu (2.4°C), Nainital (3°C) and Dehradun (3.1°C). Lucknow is also the third coldest place in the plains of the country after Kanpur (0°C) and Bahraich (0.2°C).A clear night sky allowed ground heat to escape, dragging the mercury down to almost freezing levels, which in Met parlance is a ‘severe cold wave’ condition. The chill led to formation of dense fog in the morning, taking visibility below 25 metre at 8.30am at the state Met headquarters.The fog cleared by 11am and the sun shone bright. As a result, in comparison to Monday’s 12.3 degrees Celsius, the maximum temperature on Tuesday rose to 16.4 degrees Celsius, but it was still five units below normal, which is termed a ‘cold day’. In contrast to temperatures recorded at Amausi on the outskirts, the maximum reading at Lucknow University in the heart of the city was 13.8.The weather is expected to change on the first day of 2020. A western disturbance (WD) that hit the Himalayas on Tuesday will cut off the flow of the North Wind from snow-clad mountains of Himachal Pradesh. The icy winds will be replaced with comparatively warm and moist easterlies from the Bay of Bengal. “Temperatures may also rise by a couple of degrees. However, the WD will cause snow fall in the hills and rain in UP from Wednesday till Sunday,” said state Met director JP Gupta.In Lucknow, Wednesday will be partly cloudy with little chances of rainfall.

UP CM Yogi Adityanath

LUCKNOW: With the BJP losing yet another Hindi heartland state, having ceded Jharkhand to JMM-Congress combine, the new year brings new challenges for UP CM Yogi Adityanath who has to now steer the state towards the 2022 Assembly elections.

With the state occupying nearly eight per cent of the geographical area and housing 17 per cent population of the country, and with the prime minister and defence minister apart from the highest number of party MPs – 63 – from here, the responsibility on Yogi’s shoulders to perform is heavier than perhaps any other state. As state polls inch closer, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has plans to increase his footprint in UP, having already attended two programmes — in Kanpur and Lucknow — and is likely to be here twice in January and then in February.

In January, PM is expected to lay the foundation for the Rs 15,000-crore Bundelkhand Expressway and then attend the Defence Expo in February. He is also expected to inaugurate a cancer hospital in January. Year 2020 is crucial for the Yogi government as it will be hurtling to complete the programmes and projects launched by it in the last three years.

To meet this challenge, the chief minister has put development agenda on fast track by approving 21 new medical colleges, three conventional universities, police and forensic law university, sports and Ayush University, the ambitious defence corridor and the Kanpur Metro . The state government has passed the second supplementary budget in its last assembly session and released over Rs 1,000 crore for expressways only reiterating its commitment to consolidating infrastructure projects.

As the government is aggressively pursuing its development agenda, it faces a political challenge from within with a number of MLAs protesting against their own government in the state assembly last week.

Opposition too, mainly SP and Congress, are upping the ante and gearing up against the BJP government for 2022 polls.

Police step up vigil in the area after the December 20 violence

VADODARA: The detection of crime branch (DCB) arrested four more persons on Tuesday in connection with the rioting that broke out in Hathikhana area on December 20.

The police said that all the four are prime accused and had planned violent protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The cops had been searching for the accused over last two weeks and had made different teams to track them down. They were arrested from Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar and Godhra. “The four were part of the plan hatched to create trouble in Hathikhana area. They were involved in rioting and instigating the mobs too,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime).

The police said that all the accused have offences registered against them. While 28-year-old Shahrukh Pathan, 36-year-old Sabir Sheikh and 34-year-old Waseem Sheikh were booked for assault by Panigate police in January this year, Javed Pathan was arrested for rioting by the city police in 2017.

The police said that the key accused had planned to create trouble during a rally to protest against CAA in the city. But since the cops didn’t give permission to the rally, they instigated the Hathikhana residents on December 20. The accused, who were arrested earlier, also include a man from West Bengal who settled in the city 20 years ago.

Three cops were injured and several vehicles damaged when rioting broke out in Hathikhana on December 20 over videography being done by the cops. The police had to fire two rounds and lob 30 teargas shells to disperse the rioters who pelted stones at them. The crime branch also seized weapons including swords and daggers from one of the accused in the riots.

The police later identified the accused from the CCTVs installed in the area and formed several teams to nab them. Some of the accused were arrested from a plush flat in Tandalja where they were hiding after the riots.

The varsity had issued a circular regarding the same on December 27.

An official from the SUK’s exam department said, “October and November witness a number of athletic competitions. The players who participate in these competition are often busy with preparations due to which they miss their semester examinations. Hence, the initiative will give such students a chance to appear for exams they missed. These exams have a different schedule than that of the regular students.”

The official further said that the respective exam centres from the division have been asked to conduct the exams of such students as per the examination department norms. The department has attached the schedule (in the circular) and examination centre for these students where they can appear for the exams. Students can use the hall tickets that they were given for October/November semester exams.

The exam centres for these students have been already finalised according to their courses. The centres have been decided with respect to the number of students appearing for the said exams.

“For Kolhapur district, city-based New College will host the said exam. For Sangli, Shrimati Kasturbai Walchand College will host the exam, followed by Lal Bahadur Shastri College in Satara,” the circular read.

The varsity’s winter semester examination commenced in October earlier this year and is in the final stage. In fact, the results of most exams are already out. SUK officials said that the admission process of most courses got delayed due to floods in August.

COIMBATORE: The rural police are on the lookout for a Vadavalli-based father-son duo, who cheated two businessmen of Rs 4.25 crore by promising to arrange loans.

Police identified them as Thangavel, a realtor and his son Praveen, a moneylender, of Thondamuthur Road at Vadavalli . “A Bengaluru-based businessman had approached them a few months ago seeking Rs 100 crore loan to expand his business. The duo promised to arrange the money and demanded Rs 1.25 crore as processing fee. The businessman gave them the money in several instalments. But they went missing two weeks ago,” a police officer said.

A Kerala-based businessman had also filed a complaint against the duo with the Vadavalli police last week. “He had also approached Thangavel and Praveen for Rs 100 crore loan and gave them Rs 3 crore as processing fee,” the officer added.

Thangavel and Praveen have filed petition before the Madras high court seeking anticipatory bail, a police officer said. “The Vadavalli police have filed a counter petition and requested the court not to grant them bail. Most of our personnel are deployed at the vote counting centres in the district. After the election result is announced, police teams will trace their whereabouts.”

The father-son duo had cheated several businessmen in Kerala and Bengaluru, the officer said. “Those who were cheated by them should approach the Vadavalli police.”

Kolhapur: The delay in receiving water tax bills has irked citizens who have complained that they have not received bills for the past two months. Some have complained that they have received a combined bill of previous two months along with the current ones.

, citizens are getting the water tax bills late owing to technical issues related to spot billing machines.

The water supply department of the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) said that there is delay in issuing bills is owing to some technical glitch.

A senior official of water supply department said, “Citizens said that the inflated water tax bills have been issued to them which may be right as the bi-monthly bills for some of them were not issued in time and the cumulative bill has been issued to them. Some are claiming that the fine amount has been included in the bills issued which were delayed earlier. In such cases, we will correct the bills at the time of payment. We have reported issues with over 20 spot billing machines. The printers of some machines are not working properly. We have to cover over 90,000 connections in two months and, with the shortage of machines, the delays may occur.”

The civic body has a total of 60 spot billing machines. A civic official said that the KMC is procuring 25 spot billing machines in addition to the existing 60 that will help cover the delays in issuing of water tax bills. Spot billing technique aims to speed up the process of issuing these bills, especially on a monthly basis. However, the purpose has not yet been served.

“We have now introduced spot collection in some localities so that the residents do not have to rush to the CFC’s every time for paying bills. They now can pay the bills digitally. The meter readers have to do both the tasks — note down the reading for issuing bills on the spot and collect the bill amount,” added the official.

Vadodara: The police is likely to seek compensation from the rioters who damaged their vehicles in Hathikhana area of the city on December 20. Dozens of rioters had resorted to stone pelting in Mahavat lane and even attacked the cops. Four police vehicles parked in the area were damages during the violence.

“The damages were to tune of Rs 40,000 as the vehicle’s windshields were broken due to stone pelting. The assessment of damages was done by our team. We will now take up the process to recover the compensation from the key persons accused in the rioting,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime). The cops are trying to ascertain the process of recovery and they will also write to the state government.

“We didn’t suffer much damages but the plan to seek compensation is to put pressure on the rioters and send them a message that they won’t get away if they damage public property,” said a police official. Though the police have booked dozens of men in the rioting case, compensation will be sought from eight to 10 key accused.

The cops seem to have taken a cue from the Uttar Pradesh government that has decided to seal the properties of those involved in damaging public property during riots against the CAA.

NEW DELHI: Over 300 policemen were injured in the violent protests against the new citizenship law in the capital some days ago. Most of them were not wearing anti-riot gear and those donning old body armour returned home with injuries. The paramilitary forces and the frontline of Delhi Police , protected by proper gear, saved the day on these occasions.The Indian capital, where around 15,000 protests and demonstrations take place every year, seems to have a police force that is ill equipped to handle violent mobs. Riot police in western countries are not only dressed in modern full-body protection, but also have advance equipment to disperse large crowd. Many forces use long range acoustic devices or sound cannons that produce a high-pitch sound causing excruciating pain in the ears, tasers that paralyse people with electricity for a few seconds and flash bangs that blind protesters for some time.While Delhi Police has discarded wooden sticks for polycarbonate canes and shields, it still makes do with outdated body protectors and helmets and basic knee and elbow pads. Delhi Police is estimated to have around 52,000 shields, 85,000 ballistic helmets with visors, 38,000 polycarbonate canes and 41,000 old body protectors.The cops have been contemplating the purchase of advanced riot control tools, but have been unable to experiment with modern equipment because almost all major protests have taken place in habited areas. Delhi Police was planning to buy five sound cannon guns in 2013, but the plan never took off. They got a few for trials, but have not used them, according to officers.“During the protests in Jamia Millia Islamia, there were occasions when some subordinates suggested the use of flash bangs, sound cannons or other devices when the situation seemed to be spinning out of control. However, we desisted from using them because it was a residential area and it was night time,” said a senior officer.Police say that most policemen are injured when protesters throw stones at them. Even though the cops are provided ballistic helmets, most of them are not designed to take the impact of heavy stones. They only protect the face and head from close range attacks with sticks or batons.According to policemen, a bulk of the body protectors used by Delhi Police is archaic and of little help when attacked on the sides. “Moreover they are bulky to wear and impedes chases after protesters,” said an officer who was injured in one of the riots last week. “In most cases, a policeman who gets attacked either falls back due to the weight of the jacket or loses his balance and falls down.”Officers feel the procurement of advanced full-body protectors should be expedited. Last year, Delhi Police procured 1,500 such protectors, all of the type worn by forces in the West. Alongside the old inventory of 960, the cops now have 2,460 protectors, which is roughly just around a quarter of the total requirement.The advanced kit, which has a strong shock-absorbing capacity, is divided into eight parts. While a specially designed vest guards the chest, other protection include elbow pads, guards for the shin, upper arm, groin and thigh and shoulder pads for all-round protection.Last year, Delhi Police also procured around 800 new, differently designed barricades. The side facing the protesters has a plain and slippery surface, while the other side has provisions for policemen to stand on it to interact with or watch the protesters. These barricades are designed to prevent anyone from scale it except from the side the policemen are standing on. To prevent any hand grip on the barriers, they are fitted with a thick wire mesh.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73053548,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-985183,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/heres-why-they-need-reinforcements/articleshow/73051767.cms

Patil said that there has been a dip in the number of serious offences in the last two months of 2019 as police arrested bag lifters, bike thieves, chain snatchers and highway robbers.

There was also a surge in chain snatching cases in 2019. While 13 of the 44 cases were detected till November, 10 of the 22 such cases were detected in 2018.

AHMEDABAD: Following a search-and-survey operation on Dishman Carbogen Amcis Ltd earlier this month, the state income tax (I-T) department has claimed to have found a trail of unaccounted for cash of more than Rs 160 crore. The total cash trail in the case is Rs 327 crore.

The I-T department had carried out a major search-and-survey operation on multiple premises held by the pharma company on December 19. The teams had found and seized valuables worth Rs 1.39 crore including Rs 64.47 lakh in cash and Rs 42 lakh in 16 foreign currencies. The investigators are yet to disclose the details of seizures from 24 lockers.

“The senior management and record keepers of the firm have admitted to dealing in accommodation entries for unaccounted for cash of the group,” said an official aware of the developments. He said that a chartered accountancy firm in Ahmedabad is also under the scanner. “The department has collected evidence of bogus loans and advances, purchase transactions, sales commissions, and capital expenditure,” he said.

Officials said that the investigation so far has revealed net receipts of Rs 600 crore, loan advances given at Rs 700 crore, bogus purchases and sales worth Rs 50 crore, and bogus income and sales commissions worth Rs 90 crore. “No evidence of rendering services could be found to justify the receipts,” said the official.

Sources added that forged transactions and property dealings could connect the company’s finances to a previous case in which two entry operators from the city were found to be providing their services to various city firms. “The concept of base erosion and profit shifting have also been found in the case,” said the official. “About 90% of sales by the city-based company is in the form of exports and of the total exports, 80% was to their own enterprises.” The official said that of the goodwill of Rs 1,326 crore that the company had shown at the time of the merger, it has claimed Rs 900 crore.

They hope that the cluster would equip them to compete with big players.

The total project cost will be Rs 15.3crore, Kamalhasan said. “Of this, the company has put in Rs 1.5crore for the land and Rs 1crore for the building. Through the scheme for setting up industrial clusters, the state government will contribute 10% of the project cost and the Centre will put in 80% of the total project budget and this would cover the machinery cost,” he said.

Of the 6,000 members in the company, 60 have made major investment in the cluster, Kamalhasan said. “The facility will come up on a seven-cent plot on Vysial Street in the city where there is a high concentration of micro gold smithies. The cluster will focus on jobwork for micro and small jewel manufacturers. They can use the machinery for production. Over the last decade, micro and small players were losing out to corporates. The facility will help them produce designs on par with the big players.”

Over the last five years, the number of small smithies in the city had reduced by half due to competition and now only 50,000 remain, the official added.

DEHRADUN: With cold conditions intensifying in Uttarakhand and the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting snowfall and rain spells from January 1, revellers flocked to popular tourist destinations across the state on Tuesday to welcome the New Year.

Majority of the hotels, resorts and guest houses in hill stations like Mussoorie, Mukteshwar, Auli, and Chakrata remained packed to capacity on Tuesday night.

Devendra Belwal, a hotelier from Dhanaulti, told TOI, “There is a heavy tourist rush in the town and hotels are reporting around 90% occupancy. Hotels in Kanatal (another hill resort located 16 km away from Dhanaulti) also witnessed around 80% occupancy.”

Similarly, the ski town of Auli, which had witnessed good snowfall in December, remained choc-a-bloc with tourists who wanted to usher in the New Year amidst a blanket of snow. According to an estimate, over 5000 tourists reached Auli to celebrate New Year and all the hotels and guest houses in the town remained full on New Year's Eve.

In Kumaon, Corbett Tiger Reserve and Ramnagar witnessed a similar tourist rush. “Most of the hotels in our area had around 90% occupancy. We hope to recover the losses we suffered due to anti-CAA protests,” said Hari Mann, president of Ramnagar hotel association.

Meanwhile, Nainital town remained an exception with tourist arrivals below expectations which hoteliers of the area attributed to the fallout of the CAA and NRC protests.

LUCKNOW: The UP government has identified plots of land outside the periphery of the “panchkosi parikrama” to be offered to the Sunni Waqf Board as an alternative site for a mosque as mandated by the Supreme Court in its verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case.

“Panchkosi parikrama” is the 15-km-long circular route taken by devotees within Ayodhya to pay obeisance.

Top government sources told TOI that as many as five potential sites close to highways passing by Ayodhya have been identified and sent to the Union home ministry for clearance.

Plots have been identified on the Ayodhya-Faizabad Road, Ayodhya- Basti Road, Ayodhya-Sultanpur Road, Ayodhya-Gorakhour Road, along with one more spot.

Sources said land has been identified beyond the “panchkosi parikrama” periphery so that devotees are not inconvenienced when Muslim and Hindu festivals are held simultaneously. Sources also said a mosque closer to highway will ensure easy access to Muslims.

Most part of the temple town, with a major portion of its population, is situated within the “panchkosi parikrama” route.

On November 9, the Supreme Court had asked for allocation of five acres of land to Muslims to build a mosque as a compensation for the Babri Masjid . While the Sunni Waqf Board is yet to decide on whether to accept the alternative land, other Muslim parties have openly rejected the offer.

331,['1/01/2020'],Three ministers to bring development to district,"This story is from January 1, 2020

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: The three ministers — one each from Congress and NCP and an independent — from Kolhapur district are expected to boost the chances of the Congress and NCP in the local elections in 2020. The three ministers from three different parts of the district will bring overall development, locals said.

Senior NCP minister Hasan Mushrif , a Sharad Pawar loyalist, has made it to the state cabinet once again and will most likely get to be the district guardian minister too. A prominent Muslim face of the party, he has significant clout in the district through the sugar mills and the cooperative bank.

Political observers said Mushrif’s unbending loyalty with the NCP chief and his ability to subvert anti-incumbency has made him a formidable force in the loal politics.

Congress MLC Satej Patil has returned to the cabinet as minister of state. He held the same position in the 2009 democratic front government and handled the key home department. Though he belongs to the dominant D Y Patil family, he faced defeat in 2014 assembly constituency.

Over the past five years, he worked hard and stitched some unique alliances to ensure Congress win in the recent assembly polls. In 2014, the Congress was totally wiped out from the district; however, in 2019, Congress won four seats. Considering his contribution to the party win, he was hoping to be appointed a cabinet minister this time around. However, the MVA has decided not to appoint two cabinet ministers from one district.

Inclusion of independent MLA from Shirol, Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar , came as a surprise to even the Shiv Sena activists. He has won from a constituency that is considered a Shiv Sena and Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana chief Raju Shetti’s home turf.

Yadravkar has sought a nomination from NCP but after the results, announced his support to Shiv Sena. He is known to be close to Sharad Pawar.

Political observers said his inclusion was a bid to tame Shetti, who was not even invited for the cabinet expansion ceremony despite being an ally of Congress-NCP. Locals said Yadravkar would help Shiv Sena build its base in Shirol and nearby constituencies.

AYODHYA : After terror intercepts by intelligence agencies and apprehension of violent protests against the citizenship law and NPR, the Ayodhya district administration extended prohibitory orders in Ayodhya for the third time this year on Tuesday.

Curbs were put in place before Diwali and extended before the Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya, when the temple town was turned into a fortress. Now, prohibitory orders have again been extended till February 25.

In a tweet, Ayodhya district magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha said prohibitory orders were being extended in view of intelligence input of a terror strike and protests against CAA and NRC. “Agami samay mein atankwadi gatividhiyon, vibhinn dharmik, rajnaitik karyakramon, pratiyogi/shaikshanik parikshaon tatha CAA-2019 va NRC evam NPR ke virodh ke drishtigat lok/shanti vyavastha evam jansuraksha banaye rakhne ki drishti se sampoorn janpad mein dhara 144 tatkal prabhavi, jo 25/02/20 tak prabhavi rahegi (In view of terrorist activities, various religious and political programmes, competitive/other examinations and protests against CAA, NRC and NPR, existing prohibitory orders in the district will remain effective till February 25 to maintain peace and order),” the DM tweeted.

Talking to TOI, Ayodhya SSP Ashish Tiwari said, “There is always a threat of a terrorist attack. There have been incidents in 1992 (Babri Masjid demolition) 2005 (terrorist attack on Ram Janambhoomi) and 2012 (communal riots in Faizabad ).”

The order warns people against collecting stones or empty bottles on rooftops or holding programmes or meetings that may breach communal harmony.

No person will be allowed to install idols of any god or goddess and electronic media will not be allowed to hold debates without permission. No person will be allowed to hold any programme on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue, the DM’s order stated.

AHMEDABAD: The Class X and XII board exams will be conducted from March 5 to March 21 by the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB).

The exam committee of the GSHSEB met on Tuesday to finalize the examination schedule, which has been posted on the board’s website. The main exams for Class X are to be held between March 5 and March 16.

The Class XII science stream main papers will be held from March 5 to March 14, while the exams will end on March 16. The Class XII general stream exams will be held from March 5 to March 21. Some 18 lakh students had taken the 2019 board exams which had begun on March 7.

About 17.4 lakh students are expected to participate this year, according to the figures available so far, a GSHSEB official said.

“This is 30,000-40,000 fewer than last year. The decline is due to the number of repeaters and external students, which has fallen,” the official said.

Of the 17.4 lakh students, 11 lakh are in Class X, 1.4 lakh are in Class XII science stream and 5.3 lakh are in Class XII general stream.

The board decided to bar as many as 25 centres where exams were held last year, due to malpractices, sources said.

“Some 41 new centres have been approved. For Class X, of 42 applications for new exam centres, 29 have been cleared. In the case of Class XII science, two new centres of seven have been approved. For Class XII general stream, 10 new centres of 25 applications have been given the green light,” a source said.

VADODARA: An office of an internet service providing company at Sampatrao Colony was gutted on Tuesday morning after a short-circuit in the air-conditioner in the office on second floor sparked a fire which soon engulfed the office.

According to fire department sources, the security guard of the building noticed the smoke coming out of the window of the office and alerted the fire brigade.

The office was located on the second floor of the building in which the ground and first floors had residential homes. As the residents learnt about the fire, they quickly evacuated the building. “With no human presence in the building our work had become easy, but thick smoke inside the office made us struggle initially,” said fire officer Digvijaysinh Parmar. He added that the fire was completely doused within 30 minutes.

However, the electronic equipment including computers, LED television and air-conditioners were gutted. “Other office equipment including furniture was destroyed,” Parmar said. “The air-conditioners were probably switched off, but overload in the wiring may have caused the short-circuit,” he added.

AURANGABAD: Residents of Satara and Deolai areas staged a rasta roko on Monday to press for their demand for the construction of an approach road to Satara Tanda.

The residents, led by activist group Banjara Brigade, demanded that the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) construct a 1km road from SRPF camp entrance to the Satara Tanda.

Ravikant Rathod of the Banjara Brigade said that the group had given a memorandum on December 23 to the municipal commissioner to take a decision on the road construction. “We had said that if the municipal commissioner did not take cognisance of our demand, an agitation will be launched on December 30. As the municipal corporation did not make any move, we had to hold the rasta roko stir on Monday,” said Rathod. Several residents including Rohidas Pawar, Sanjay Pawar and Raviraj Rathod of the Banjara Brigade had joined the agitation.

According to Sominath Shirane from the Satara-Deolai Sangharsh Samiti, currently, residents have to use the road which passes through the SRPF camp. “The SRPF has prohibited the entry of four-wheelers and allows only two-wheelers, which has to pass through many check-posts. Residents want an alternate road so that they do not have to go through this inconvenience everyday,” said Shirane.

When asked, AMC engineer Vasant Bhoye squarely put the responsibility of the road cosntruction on the district collector. “In order to make an alternate road, the agricultural lands of the farmers have to be acquired. This can be done through the district collector’s office. In addition, the road construction will have to be done with MLA fund or state government’s help,” said Bhoye.

Shirane said the AMC has imposed taxes on the residents of Satara and Deolai but was not providing any civic amenities. “We as residents are not responsible to follow up with different offices. It is the civic body’s responsibility,” he said.

AURANGABAD: City Chowk police arrested a 55-year-old man on Monday who allegedly posed as an assistant commissioner of police and duped scores of people. Cash, baton used by police, a dummy firearm, a police uniform and a few grams of gold have been recovered from the suspect.

The suspect, Khalil Ibrahim Khan, is a native of Kranti Nagar in Ambejogai tehsil, Beed district. He was produced before a court on Tuesday, which remanded him in police custody. Police have also seized four AADHAR cards, voter identity cards of different states and three passbooks of different banks. A car bearing police’s logo has also been seized. Police have slapped sections 170, 171, 464, 468, 471 and 511 of the IPC on Khan.

Sources said that Khan used to live in Naregaon area of the city. While posing as a policeman there, he had allegedly forced a woman to marry his kin. When clashes started breaking out frequently between the woman and Khan’s kin and the marriage was on the verge of collapse, the woman’s family learnt that Khan was not a cop and that he was allegedly cheating people by posing as a cop. After he was exposed, Khan fled Naregaon area.

On Monday night, a relative of the woman spotted Khan waiting outside the Government Cancer Hospital in a car and immediately alerted police. Following the tip-off, a police team led by assistant inspector Mohsin Sayyed reached the spot and found Khan sitting in his car. They checked his car and found his behaviour suspicious.

API Sayyed said, “We suspect that the accused has reportedly duped innumerable people by posing as a police officer. He had parked his car on the roadside and was probably waiting for a gullible target.”

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: 2020 is going to be a poll packed year for Kolhapur district as elections to several local bodies and cooperative institutes are slated one after the other. The changed political equations in the state are going to make these contests intriguing.

Most MPs and MLAs, who contested the elections this year, have deep rooted links to the cooperative sector. For the past five years, after BJP came to power, almost all of them struggled to retain their positions in the cooperative institutes. In 2020, the elections for Gokul cooperative dairy and Kolhapur district central cooperative bank are going to take place. Both these institutes are prominent establishments.

The first political fight is going to be the election for Gokul dairy in April. The dairy has a fortnightly turnover of Rs 15 crore and is among the largest cooperative dairies in the region. At present, Mahadevrao Mahadik and Congress MLA P N Patil have their majority members elected over the directorial body of the dairy.

Both are likely to contest the election together while on other hand the leaders of Congress, Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena are going to contest together. In Kolhapur, personal ties have more influence in deciding the political outcome.

The Mahadik family will have to face Congress MLC Satej Patil, who has repeatedly alleged corruption in the functioning of the dairy. Mahadik faced a setback after Patil opposed the proposal to turn Gokul into a multi-state entity. It even caused Mahadik politically. His nephew and sitting MP Dhananjay Mahadik was defeated. Now, Mahadik-P N Patil have got the support of newly elected MLA and former minister Vinay Kore.

According to the close aides of Mahadik, Kore’s entry into Gokul politics is deliberate. “Kore stays aloof from Gokul’s politics as he has his own dairy to look after. We are quite clear that owing to new combinations taking place, especially understanding of traditional rivals and new rivals in the form of Sena leaders, we have to compensate the loss. Kore will help fill the gap. We will get adequate votes to get our panel elected,” said a close of aide of Mahadik, on the request of anonymity.

At the start of the year, election for the post of president and deputy president of Zilla Parishad are going to take place. The new alliance of Cong-NCP and Sena are confident of toppling the dominance of BJP, which is in power with the support of Mahadik.

The results will show the extent of trust between the new alliance of the three parties and secondly if it comes in favour of the three-party alliance it will be a big blow to BJP-Mahadik front. The outcome will set the tenor for the Gokul and district co-operative bank elections.

At the tail end of the year 2020, all the political parties will try hard to gain power in Kolhapur Municipal Corporation. The dominance over the KMC is required especially to provide leadership opportunities to the supporters. At present, Congress and NCP are in power and they have always indirect support of Shiv Sena. The Mahadiks will contest the KMC election as part of BJP and Dhananjay will face direct confrontation from Satej Patil. The Congress has ruled KMC for last ten years.

A close of Patil said, “We have power in the state and we will be able to bring in funds to carry out development works in the city. The KMC is cash strapped. Politically, the KMC is important as it’s jurisdiction lies both Kolhapur North and Kolhapur South assembly segments.”

Panaji: The death of a third person at Sunburn Klassique evoked a sharp reaction from Congress and GFP , with both parties alleging that the three persons died after consuming drugs .

GFP and Congress demanded an inquiry into the three deaths after alleging that tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar and chief minister Pramod Sawant were “personally responsible for the deaths”.

Congress called for a special investigation team, headed by a retired high court judge, to be constituted to probe the deaths. “This is another case of suspected drug abuse. We asked the state government to take precautions, but the police did not,” said state Mahila Congress president Pratima Coutinho. Coutinho also criticised Ajgaonkar for dancing at Sunburn Klassique, despite three people dying at the event.

Congress media cell convener Trajano D’Mello said that drugs were flourishing in the state, with the drug trade emerging as the “funding machine of the BJP”.

“Goa’s decline as a prime tourist destination is not only because of the government’s pathetic gutlessness to stop nefarious activities, but also due to its paucity of ideas, incompetence, and its myopic vision of tourism as nothing more than tripping out at a rave party,” said GFP vice-president Durgadas Kamat.

Goa police has registered all three cases as unnatural death. “Considering there is a move to hush up the matter, the chief minister should set up an SIT headed by a retired high court judge within eight days. If he does not do this, then we have to take it that the chief minister has a hand in these deaths,” said D’Mello.

Aurangabad: Municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey has instructed officials to verify the bills produced by the civil contractors by visiting the spots where the civic works are being carried out.

While visiting zone-7 as part of his city-wide inspection on Tuesday, Pandey reminded officers, especially the city engineer and ward engineers, to verify whether the civil works, for which contractors were producing bills, were carried out properly.

Around 200 contractors had ended their 68-day agitation on December 19 after Pandey assured them that AMC would start clearing their dues from January 15th. These contractors have submitted bills ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 3 crore for civil works like water pipeline, drainage line and road construction.

Pandey has asked the civic officials to submit reports of tallying the bills with the civil works before January 15.

Pandey started the visit from Trimurti Colony and covered Vishwabharti Colony, Ulka Nagari, Shanti Niketan Colony and other areas in zone 7 over nearly two hours.

During his tour, Pandey asked all the officials accompanying him to ensure they have the Swachhata app installed on their phones and that they were using it to address complaints of citizens. Notably, the download and use of Swachhata app is a criterion for Swachh Survekshan 2020. Later in the day, Pandey held a meeting of all the staffers of the municipal corporation and asked them to use the app and ensure maximum participation from citizens.

He lauded an elderly couple in the Vishwabharti colony for giving segregated waste diligently to the waste collection vehicle.

AHMEDABAD: With vehicle demand taking a hit in the automobile sector, two-wheeler dealers are struggling to sell off their Bharat Stage (BS)-IV inventories. According to the Supreme Court order last year, the sales of BS-IV compliant vehicles will be completely stopped from April 1, 2020. Since the automobile demand, especially that for two-wheelers, has taken a massive hit, dealers are struggling with inventory pile-ups.According to data by Union ministry of road transport and highways, the number of two-wheelers registered from December 1 to December 30 this year has gone down by 44.5% against last year. “Two-wheeler dealers are offering massive discounts on all the BS-IV models and yet, the inventory continued to remain piled up. At present, most dealers have inventory worth two and a half months. After sales faring well in October during the Navratri-Diwali season, November and December saw a steep drop in sales,” said Pranav Shah, director, Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA) – Gujarat .Overall weakened consumer confidence added to slowing demand in the automobile sector. “With businesses in several sectors going slow, consumer confidence has weakened. While December sales are usually in slow gear, this time around the de-growth is phenomenally high as we hardly see customers walking into our showrooms. The situation does not look promising going forward because the BS-VI compliant models will be priced high by at least Rs 10,000 across all the models,” said Rajesh Patel, a city-based two-wheeler dealer.Several two-wheeler dealers are unable to stock up on BS-VI compliant vehicles because of financial crisis, as many of them have exhausted their borrowing capacity. “Most of the dealers have exhausted their financial limit with borrowings for BS-IV compliant vehicles. Thus, most of them are unable to borrow further for a BS-VI inventory. Moreover, several manufacturers are yet to release BS-VI compliant models, many of which will be available at dealerships by January first week,” Shah said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73054811,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-554488,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/slow-demand-leaves-dealers-with-bs-iv-inventory-pile-up/articleshow/73051836.cms

NEW DELHI: With the much awaited Phase IV, Delhi Metro will reach a new height. Haiderpur Badli Mor , where the construction work of Phase IV started on Monday, will be the tallest metro station with platforms at a height of 23.5 metres — as high as a seven-storey building . The station is expected to be completed by mid-2022.The station will be part of the 28.9km Janakpuri West-RK Ashram Marg corridor, an extension of Magenta Line (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri West). On Monday, the piling work started for the station as part of Phase IV’s first civil contract, which was awarded in November for the construction of a portion of the corridor. The entire corridor will have 22 stations.Currently, Mayur Vihar Phase I station on Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) holds the title of Delhi Metro’s tallest station with platforms located at a height of 22 metres. The Pink Line viaduct is constructed above the older Blue Line (Dwarka-Noida Electronic City/Vaishali). Previously, it was another station on Pink Line — Karkardooma — that was the tallest station at a height of 20 metres. Pink Line also has the highest point on the Delhi Metro network — 23.6 metres — at Dhaula Kuan where it crosses above the Airport Express line.“The platforms of Haiderpur Badli Mor, which will come up above the Phase III Yellow Line (Samaypur Badli-HUDA City Centre) station, will have the highest ever platform in Delhi Metro,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). “At Haiderpur Badli Mor, the viaduct will also cross the existing Yellow Line viaduct at a considerable height,” he said.“During the construction, we will ensure that services on Yellow Line are not impacted at all. Elaborate monitoring equipment, including high-capacity cameras, will be installed to monitor the construction work above Yellow Line,” Dayal said. “The progress of this work will be centrally monitored by DMRC’s engineers,” he added.Partial work for Haiderpur Badli Mor, which is going to be an interchange station, was completed along with the construction of the Phase III Yellow Line station. “Provisions were kept for the Phase III station’s expansion as an interchange facility in Phase IV. This will help in substantially reducing construction time as well as costs in Phase IV,” Dayal said. The platforms of the upcoming station are ready and DMRC now needs to add a roof and a station building.As part of the first civil contract for Phase IV, three interchange stations — Peeragarhi (with Green Line), Madhuban Chowk (with Red Line) and Haiderpur Badli Mor (with Yellow Line) — will come up. Three corridors of Phase IV have been approved so far, under which 61.6km of new lines will be constructed. These corridors, with 45 stations, are 20.2km-long Aerocity-Tughlaqabad, 28.9km-long RK Ashram-Janakpuri West and 12.5km-long Maujpur-Majlis Park.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73052866,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-429672,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metro-station-as-tall-as-a-7-floor-building/articleshow/73051811.cms
344,['1/01/2020'],Two landslide-hit families to move into new houses on Jan 6,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Kozhikode: It is going to be a dream come true moment for the two landslide-hit families of Karinchola when they will be moving to a new house constructed by student volunteers of the National Service Scheme in Kozhikode on January 6, 2020.

The two landslides affected families at Karinchola, who have been staying in rented houses since the landslide in June, 2018, will shift to their own house at Chembrakunda, Kattippara on the day. Education minister C Raveendranath will hand over the keys of houses to K Sumathi and Ananya Anilkumar.

Thanks to the National Service Scheme (NSS) Higher secondary section’s housing project. Considered to be the first of its kind, an initiative taken by a district NSS unit in Malabar region, the decision to construct new houses to three beneficiaries was suggested by the NSS volunteers who visited the site of Karinchola landslide site. As many as 14 people lost their lives in a landslide which washed away an entire hillock at Karinchola situated in the limits of Kattippara grama panchayat.

A total of 13,900 NSS volunteers from 139 schools in the district raised a total of Rs 16 lakh through fundraising activity conducted over two months. Kanivu gramam donated five cents of land each to the beneficiaries to construct the house. Kattippara grama panchayat authorities have helped the district NSS to find the suitable land at Chembrakunda to construct houses. Work such as leveling the areas, loading and unloading of construction materials and supply of construction materials to the skilled labourers during the concreating and painting was carried out by NSS volunteers. The 500 square feet house has two bedrooms, attached common bathroom for the bedrooms, kitchen, living room and verandah.

K Sumathi (51), one of the beneficiaries of the project, said that the beautiful house was the result of enormous effort put by the NSS volunteers. “The children worked day and night without break and I don’t have words to express gratitude to them for the sincere efforts taken to complete the construction of houses,” said an emotional Sumathi adding that she and her two sons had a narrow escape when the landslide occurred on the morning of June, 2018. “We first ran upward and then downward seeing gushing water and after hearing a loud sound. It took only ten minutes to wash out the entire hillock. Our houses were damaged completely,” she said adding that she is overexcited to move to a new house after staying one and half years at the rented house.

Meanwhile, NSS district coordinator S Sreechith said that NSS took the decision to construct three houses on the basis of overwhelming response received from public for its fund raising initiative. “The NSS volunteers have proved the real meaning of empathy by taking up the construction work of houses. Kattippara grama panchayat and Kanivu Gramam members have also lent their helping hands for the materialization of the houses. The construction of the third house has just begun,” he said.

Civic body meticulously documented for better results this year

VADODARA/AHMEDABAD: From a very average 21 in the first quarter to the fourth place in the second quarter of this fiscal, Vadodara sprung a surprise in the Swachh Survekshan rankings for the first and second quarter declared on Tuesday.

Three cities from the state – Rajkot, Vadodara and Ahmedabad – have been ranked in the top ten cities in the second quarter of Swachh Survekshan. Rajkot has surprised many by bagging the second position while Ahmedabad was ranked sixth.

Vadodara which was not in the top 20 list of the cities with over 10 lakh population jumped to the fourth position overtaking Ahmedabad and Surat city that was ranked third in first quarter. Surat fell to the 20th position in the second quarter. Rajkot which was ranked fifth in the country in first quarter has been ranked second.

Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) in-charge additional city engineer Shailesh Naik said that the civic body had been meticulous with documentation in the second quarter leading to better results. “We had observed in the previous Swachh Survekshans too that this was a major area where we lacked. This time we were prepared and made necessary improvements,” Nayak who is also the heads the solid waste disposal function said.

What has brought smiles to many in the civic body is the fact that the results of the second quarter when the city was ranked fourth coincided with the floods in the city. A massive drive to clean the city was taken up after the floods on July 31.

VMC sources said that the improvement was significant as the city was ranked 21 in the first quarter and reached fourth rank in the second. They added that in the overall ranking at the end of two quarters, the city was ranked 20.

The VMC has now set its eyes on the last quarter of the year that will decide the overall Swachh Survekshan rankings. “The quarterly rankings are given on the basis of telephonic surveys as well as documentation provided by us. The annual rankings will also include a visit by experts who will see things for themselves,” said Naik.

In both the first and second quarter, Porbandar town which was so far included in the list of cities does not find place in the top 20 in the list of cities with over one lakh population. Even in the In this category only, Gandhinagar was ranked 12th in the country.

Bhubaneswar: The state government has approved a proposal by Dhamra Port Company Limited (DPCL) to acquire 274.41 acres of land to build a commercial airstrip in Bhadrak district.

Premananda Khuntia, additional secretary of the commerce and transport department, recently conveyed the state government’s decision to Bhadrak collector Gyana Das.

The Adani Group-owned DPCL has been asked to obtain necessary clearances from the Airports Authority of India, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change and other agencies before building the airstrip. Sources in DPCL said the company had already started the process of seeking approvals.

The airstrip, once built, will provide a big connectivity boost to northern Odisha, which currently does not have an airport serving it. “The DPCL airstrip will not only serve the company but ensure the development of tourism and enhance commercial activities in the region,” said a senior government official.

The state government had given its approval to the project in September 2018; on November 12, 2018, it had inked an MoU with DPCL for the construction of a commercial airport near Dhamra Port.

The airstrip will be developed over 500 acres and used for both passenger and cargo movement. Sources said it would come up 20 km before Dhamra. The DPCL will invest over Rs 500 crore in the project.

Official sources said the state government would take a call on the acquisition of the remaining 226 acres later.

Sources in the Bhadrak administration said it had already identified an area near the town for the airstrip.

The airstrip will also benefit the proposed five million-metric tonne per annum (MMTPA) LNG terminal at Dhamra, the foundation of which was laid in July 2017. The terminal is being jointly developed by the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, GAIL Ltd and Adani with an investment of Rs 6,000 crore.

A special economic zone and industrial park are also being planned near the Dhamra Port.

A committee headed by DGP, Gujarat, Shivanand Jha and Additional DGP Harikrishna Patel had proposed to the home department the use the same symbol ‘GP’ (Gujarat police) on the belts and epaulettes of all police personnel below the rank of PSI. The committee had found that the identification of parent force through badges and symbols in Gujarat police personnel below the rank of PSI differed according to the district or city they were deployed in. This caused especial confusion when police teams went outside Gujarat for investigation or other official purposes.“The proposal has been approved and now the from constables to head constables, all will wear the symbol of Gujarat police, that is ‘GP’ on their shoulders instead of the symbol of the district or city police force where they are deployed. The symbol on belts will also be ‘GP’,” DGP Jha said.Lauding the move, a senior police official said, “If constables to head constables wear the same symbol, ‘GP’, it will enhance their feelings of belonging to the same force. The designation of each constable or head constable will be worn on the nameplate on the chest, so that their parent unit can be easily identified.”Confusion in proving identity outside state: Jha“Whenever our police went on duty outside the state, we noticed they faced problems in establishing their identities. If there is ‘GP’ on shoulder badges and belts they can be easily recognized as Gujarat police. The force is also happy with the step, because there will be uniformity with all members of the police force wearing the same logo on their shoulders and belts,” said DGP, Gujarat, Shivanand Jha.First change in police uniform accessories since state was formedThis is the first time since the formation of Gujarat state in 1960 that shoulder badges, chest nameplates and belt symbols of all police personnel below PSI will be changed.

File photo used for representational purpose

LUCKNOW: BJP in Uttar Pradesh has decided to widen the ambit of its month-long mass contact drive in favour of the amended citizenship law by planning to directly meet protesters and their family to remove apprehensions about CAA, notwithstanding a parallel crackdown and slapping of notices to confiscate property of those involved in violence and destruction of public property.

The party has decided to hit the grassroots and asked booth and sector-level functionaries to identify those engaged in protests and meet them.

Confirming the move, UP BJP general secretary and in charge of west UP, Vijay Bahadur Pathak, said the party’s campaign till January 25 will reach out to those driven by the political agenda of the opposition. “We need to tell them the law is about giving citizenship and not taking it away. There is nothing in it that would harm a particular community,” he said.

BJP sources said the party has decided to reach out to 50,000 villages across the state. “We have a booth and sector list of people. The cadre will speak to these people and explain the finer points of the citizenship law,” said a senior BJP functionary closely associated with the campaign.

BJP’s overdrive is seen as a damage-control exercise and attempt to counter the Opposition’s narrative on the citizenship law being anti-Muslim and against tenets of the Constitution. The Congress leadership, in fact, has been vociferous in its stand, saying the law is in conflict with Article 21 of the constitution that guarantees equality.

The protests have been violent in Uttar Pradesh, claiming 23 lives. The state authorities had taken precautionary measures, including making over 5,500 preventive arrests and snapping Internet in 18 districts and raising security and patrolling. At least 288 policemen were injured and another 61 received bullet injuries.

The city improved its position by one rank from the first quarter. Rajkot which was ranked fifth in the country in the first quarter is now second. However, Vadodara which was not among the Top 20 cities with populations bigger than 10 lakh suddenly jumped to the fourth position, overtaking Ahmedabad. Surat, which was ranked third in first quarter, fell to 20th position.

In both the first and second quarter, Porbandar, which was so far included on the list of cities did not find a place in the Top 20 cities with more than one lakh residents. Only Gandhinagar figured in this category, ranking 12th in the country

The ministry for housing and urban affairs on Tuesday, announced the results of Swachh Survekshan League 2020 (Quarter 1 and Quarter 2). In the 2018 Swacch Survekshan, Ahmedabad city had leaped into the Top 10, as the sixth cleanest city in the country.

In the first quarter, the city ranked high as it began taking measures to tackle its garbage mound issue. Officials said that in the first quarter, the city took measures to prevent people spitting on the roads and peeing by the roads or in the open.

Municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra said, “It is good that the city has been able to maintain its position in the Top 10. Ahmedabad is the only metro city to find a place in the Top 10 in the country. Mega cities like Ahmedabad have a major problem of a floating population, which the city is trying to address.” According to Nehra, the city consistently ranked among the Top 10 cleanest cities in the country.

Nehra said that the city had recently undertaken a major drive to clean the Sabarmati river. He said waste land where garbage was being dumped was cleaned and converted into green spots under the Mission Million Trees campaign.

Gandhinagar: The Gujarat Congress has alleged that the BJP-led Gujarat government and insurance companies have carried out a scam worth about Rs 30,000 crore in crop insurance schemes in the state.

Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda, Gujarat Congress Kisan Morcha leaders Rutvij Makwana and Pal Ambaliya and party spokesman Jayrajsinh Parmar organized a press conference and presented data claimed as official data of crop cutting reports for two villages, where 91% crop failure was reported but only 1.48% insurance payouts were made.

“The BJP government was not sharing crop cutting and crop damage survey data, claiming that making such information public would create a national security risk. We don’t understand how details of farmer’s crop damage can be a national security issue,” said Chavda. “We have got details of two villages in Mendarada taluka, where crop damage of 91% and 81% was reported in the survey by the state government officer, gram sevak, insurance company official and these details was approved by the government. However, against the reported damage, farmers received just 1.48% of their reported loss,” said Chavda. State agriculture minister R C Faldu termed allegations made by Gujarat Congress as baseless. “The crop damage survey is being done under the government of India’s technical advisory committee guidelines. The Congress is making these allegations out of frustration from losing badly in the panchayat byelections. I challenge the Congress to prove their allegations.”

355,['1/01/2020'],VC Kane rolls back move after ABVP’s ill-informed protest,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Nagpur: Nagpur University (NU) vice chancellor SP Kane on Monday rolled back his permission to hold a lecture series on ‘C for Citizenhood’ by former professor of social work Arun Kumar Sinha after the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) objected, mistaking it as an event against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

On Tuesday, the ABVP started distancing itself from Kane’s move after it became clear to it that the two issues were different. In its memorandum to the VC, the BJP’s students wing had labelled Sinha ‘anti-CAA’ while terming the lecture series an ‘anti-national activity’ which will create ‘doubts’ in the minds of students.

Sinha had approached the National Service Scheme (NSS) director Keshav Walke seeking an awareness campaign on citizenhood, which he says pertains to ethical, existential and behavioural issues.

On December 27, the NSS director had written to all affiliated colleges to hold a lecture for students by Sinha on ‘C for Citizenhood’ after nod from the VC, who was informed about the subject.

Yet, when ABVP opposed it, Kane withdrew the permission without explaining the difference to the delegation of the students’ wing on Monday. This is the third lecture Kane has cancelled after giving permission. In March 2017, Kane had cancelled the lecture by CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury while a discussion by students on author Nayantara Sahgal was called off in January this year.

With the ABVP changing its stance now, the NU, too, seemed to be in damage control mode.

A day after issuing the cancellation notice, NSS director Walke said the lecture series was not cancelled but put on hold in view of aspersions cast by some students.

ABVP city secretary Amit Patle blamed the VC for rushing with the decision. “Our stand is very clear. We didn’t demand cancellation but only made a request to the university to look into the issue. Later, we came to know that citizenhood is different from CAA. We do not want any anti-Constitution activity to take place. We did not know the content of the lecture. They should have explained the matter to us instead of scrapping the event,” he said.

Professor Sinha, who retired in 2013, has been working on citizenhood since last five years. “Citizenship is primarily a politico-legal idea whereas citizenhood covers the ethical, existential and behavioural aspects. The two ideas are not at loggerheads but they are different. Citizenship is a status granted by the state, while citizenhood is a role that a citizen ascribes to him/herself and tries to live like a citizen. While educating the youth or raising kids, we must lay emphasis on the role of a citizen. The society has been unable to address this issue,” he said.

Through lectures, the social work professor wants to motivate the youth and elders to try to be responsible citizens. “I do not want to talk in context of the formal citizenship concept,” he said.

Pune: Thermax Limited has bagged a Rs431-crore order from a public-private joint venture power company to set up two flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) systems at their thermal power plant in Jharkhand, hinting that industrial pollution norms in the country are getting streamlined.

By the close of trading, the shares of the company ended about 2.5% higher compared to the previous day Bombay Stock Exchange.

This was the second such order for the Pune-based company within six months, after it bagged a Rs471 crore order from a state-owned power company in July 2019.

“The environment business has had a good run in terms of order intake, and I am happy that we have concluded the year on a high note with this inclusion. It also shows that the implementation of industrial pollution norms has gained momentum in the country, considering that we bagged two large FGD orders within the short span of six months,” M S Unnikrishnan, MD & CEO, Thermax Limited, said.

The company said that the scope of supply includes design, engineering, manufacturing, civil work, construction and commissioning of the FGD systems. The commissioning of the project is scheduled over 30 months.

Bhubaneswar: The city has been decked up to celebrate the New Year in high spirit with people of almost all age groups thronging hotels, shopping malls, clubs and pubs where special arrangements were made for the Zero Night parties.

While hotels of all ranges were lit up and put up special dance and music shows for the Zero Night parties, malls and other institutions dazzled with special decorations to give party like feel to the citizens. The youngsters were seen gathering at several hangout zones to spend quality time with each other.

Nityananda Maharana, manager of a city-based hotel, said they have made arrangements for unlimited food and drink. “We have made some special arrangements for the children. Security has also been tightened for the Zero Night party,” he said.

Hotels, pubs and clubs in the city fixed fees for Zero Night parties. While some of them have made couple and stag entry free, some others have fixed charges ranging between Rs 2,000 to Rs 20,000. Special zones were also created for the elderly at several places.

“We always visit hotels and malls to hang out and celebrate the new year, but this time we thought of doing it in a different way. We called all our friends and first visited our respective homes to get the blessings of our elders and from there we stayed at one place and spent time with each other,” Samiksha Mishra, a resident of Nayapalli, said.

Religious institutions also made special arrangements for the rush. “It is the first day of the year and we need to get the blessings of the almighty. We are partying at home to welcome the New Year and have planned to visit temples tomorrow,” Shanti Lata Rath, a resident of Bomikhal, said.

Several tourist places, including Konark, Jagannath Temple in Puri and several places in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, saw the rush on New Year’s eve. “We want to see the sunrise at Konark on the very first day of the New Year,” said Sukanya Jena, a city-based college student.

358,['1/01/2020'],Kalahandi tribals to sensitise people against liquor consumption,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Bhawanipatna: Tribals in Kalahandi’s Pahadpadar panchayat under the Lanjigarh block have vowed to sensitise people of 16 villages to the health hazards and ill effects of consuming alcohol.

It has often been the reason behind early deaths, murders and family fights.

“The government will never agree to shut down liquor business because of the revenue generated from it. We are trying to sensitise people by telling them about the repercussion of liquor consumption,” said British Kumar, who is leading the movement under the banner of Khandualmali Mahila Samiti.

Banalata Majhi, a resident of Bengaon village, who is part of the movement said the country-made liquor units need to be shut down as many unemployed youths and aged are getting addicted to liquor.

She alleged that tribals in hilly areas prepare liquor at home and use it both for personal consumption as well as sell it. They collect mahua, banana, jaggery and sugar and soak it in water for three to four days and then boil this liquid inside the deep forests to make liquor. The steam of this liquid is collected and it is called “dhara mada” or alcohol, she added. “Tribals use traditional methods to prepare liquor and for that reason the alcohol is highly concentrated,” said Sushil Kumar of Lanjigarh.

Former vice-chairman of Lanjigarh block Jagdish Benia said the number of men is dwindling as they consume this highly concentrated forms of liquor over long periods of time and die. “Many women become widows at an early age,” said Benia.

Satya Mahar, the convenor of Niyamigiri Surakhya Samiti, alleged that government is not bothered about the deaths and is only eyeing the revenue generated from liquor. “The government has no record of how many people died due to consumption of alcohol in the last five years,” he said.

Former sarpanch of Pahadpadar Krushna Majhi said alcohol needs to be banned in tribal pockets. “,Tribals who are illiterate start consuming liquor since morning and suffer from liver and kidney-related diseases,” he added.

In these areas, women work as daily labourers to keep the hearth burning at home. They are also beaten up if they do not hand over the money to their drunkard husbands. “The men beat their wives and children after consuming alcohol. Incidents of murders by alcoholics have also taken place,” Lalita Majhi, a tribal, told the media.

Excise superintendent of Kalahandi Dambrudhar Khanda said raids are conducted on illegal liquor sale in the interior pockets and accordingly cases are registered and arrests have been made. But locals continue with their business after being released from jail, he said.

359,['1/01/2020'],Kolkata: Car owners complain of ‘fake cases’ on police Facebook page,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Representative image

In an SMS received from Kolkata Police , Nirupama Banerjee was told that her car had violated traffic rules at Shyambazar five-point crossing in November. “It is interesting to note that I have been residing in Ahmedabad since February 2019. This particular car has not been in use and it is in a garage in my residential complex under 24-hour CCTV surveillance which will corroborate the fact,” she claimed.

Ashok Kumar Modi faced the same problem. “I am away on a vacation since October 6 in Gujarat. My car has been parked in my garage since then. It is impossible that my car was on the AJC Bose flyover around 4am on October 8. Please look into it and withdraw the case against my car.”

“I had sold and transferred my car in 2015. The registration has changed to the new owner and a smart card has been issued in her name. The car has been fined for illegal parking a few days ago. I am getting SMS alerts to pay the fine. Not sure why your app has my name as the owner when Motor Vehicles has issued the smart card in the name of the new owner,” said Anirvanjyoti Sen after facing similar problems.

As Kolkata switches to the most modern techniques of traffic management — from using speed cams and traffic light violation cams to swiping cards at spot to pay fines — complaints of fake cases still haunt motorists. The police brass is now taking steps to ensure that grievances get addressed in the least possible time — say as early as within two hours.

Cops say most of the cases are fake in nature. “We have come across several such cases where people have received fake SMS that look similar to e-challans the traffic police department sends to motorists to alert them about their pending fines,” an officer said. In most other cases, the owners forget to upload details after a car’s ownership changes leading to SMS reaching the first owner.

But there is indeed a bigger worry. In at least a couple of recent cases, duplicate registration numbers emerged, an issue cops are likely to take up with the RTOs in 2020. “The fact that the challans are generated against one mobile number is an indication that this registration number is enrolled with his name in the motor vehicles department records. It can also mean that one registration number is fake. But this needs to be probed,” said a senior officer of the traffic department.

Earlier, Lalbazar had launched a probe after repeated complaints by owners of buses and minibuses that a few sergeants were issuing minor challans (worth Rs 100) to drivers without making any valid entry in the Kolkata traffic police records. In a memo issued on Tuesday, the traffic headquarters asked three traffic guard OCs to explain how sergeants were making entries in the time log of the bus concerned and merely collecting the fine.

“At times, the app refuses to work and the process remains incomplete. It is then that we write out the traffic guard’s name, code number and note down the mobile numbers of drivers. Later, each entry is logged into the system,” an officer explained. Whatever be the issue, police now want to ensure that these issues are looked at compassionately.

AHMEDABAD: Stretches of CG Road and SG Road turned into party zones as thousands descended on them to ring in 2020 at the stroke of midnight. Sindhu Bhavan Road and Vastrapur also drew huge crowds at restaurants and open plots. Revellers swirled to the tunes dished out by DJs and partied hard, braving the 11.6°C chill.

Mindful of the recent spate of crimes against women, the city police took no chances and deployed extra resources, including women personnel, at key locations across the city. P L Mal, DCP zone I, said that 250 police personnel along with five companies of the State Reserve Police had been deployed on CG Road. “Police also mingled with the crowds in plain clothes and kept an eye on the crowd with the CCTV network,” he said.

On SG Road, K N Damor, DCP zone VII, was at hand to ensure that no untoward incident occured. “The city has about 50 SHE teams who kept patrolling major stretches, scanning them for eve-teasers and speed demons,” said a senior city police official.

Smita Patel, who had come to CG Road with her group of friends, said that the New Year outing has been an annual ritual since her college days. “We generally dine at a restaurant and then take a stroll along the length of the road just to feel the energy, which is so contagious!” she said. “Fortunately, I have not faced any unpleasant incident.”

Till 11pm, the city police recorded 20-odd cases of drunken driving. Sources said that police had 600 breath analyzers with them. While parties went on till late, major venues wrapped up after 1.30am, said sources.

361,['1/01/2020'],"2,222 trees to face the axe to facilitate Metro’s smooth run","This story is from January 1, 2020

The felling of trees for the Metro project began near AIIMS in Saket Nagar

BHOPAL: The upcoming Metro project seems to be playing havoc with the city’s green cover as the civic body has given its nod to the construction company to chop 2,222 trees in the city, which is already losing its greenery at a fast pace in the recent times. The felling of trees for the rail project began on Monday near AIIMS, Saket Nagar. The magnitude of the problem can be well gauged from the research undertaken by a noted environmentalist Subhash Pandey that clearly states that 5 lakh trees have been chopped in the state capital in the last decade, leading to massive deterioration in quality of air.

Though Pandey refused to reveal the number of trees that are likely to be felled for the Metro project, engineer-in-chief of the project Jitendra Dubey said, “We have been granted permission to chop trees by the municipal corporation. The forest department of the Capital Project Administration (CPA) will plant four saplings for every tree that is cut, so the greenery of the city will not be affected. As the pillars for the Metro rail need to be constructed, felling of trees is unavoidable.”

According to sources, the BMC has given the construction company permission to cut down 2,222 trees in the city -- 1,199 from Karond square to AIIMS and 993 from Bhadbhada to Ratnagiri . With the CPA planting four trees for each tree that is cut, a total of 8,828 trees are to be planted in different areas of the city.

The construction company has paid Rs 1.28 crore to CPA for plantation and the forest wing of the CPA has already started the work. “So far, the construction company has chopped 1,555 trees in the city. This is the figure that they provided to us during the ground verification. In place of these trees, we are planting 4,796 saplings in different areas. The plantation work has already begun at Alia Polytechnic College, Ratibad, Tarasewania crematorium and near DAV college. We have already planted 5000 saplings,” said Sanjay Shrivastav, CPA chief conservator of forests.

Subhash Pandey, however, pointed out a major flaw in the plan saying that saplings will not compensate for the amount of oxygen a 10-year old tree gives and the carbon dioxide it absorbs, besides being home to a number of birds and insects. “We all know how the plantation is done. Big trees are cut and small saplings are planted, but no one bothers to take care of them to see them grow into trees. Even if the saplings grow, they will still take 10 to 50 years to compensate for the loss of the one big tree that was mercilessly chopped down”, said Pandey.

Commenting on the present state of the city, Pandey said, “I think scientists will have to make some new invention that will allow people to survive without oxygen. In the last decade, 5 lakh trees have been cut down and there is nothing that the departments concerned are doing about it. The pollution control board should take cognizance of the saplings planted in the last few years by various organizations, CPA and politicians. No one bothers to actually do anything and people also just become happy reading the news that saplings have been planted, without even bothering to see the real condition.”

CCF Shrivastav, however, said that the survival rate of saplings planted by them is nearly 90 to 100 percent and the chopping down of trees will be compensated in a few years. “We have planted local species like karanj, saptaparni, gulmohor and sissoo saplings that will easily grow in the climate of Bhopal. We have made fences around the saplings so that they may be protected and are also watering them regularly. The saplings will survive and increase the green belt of Madhya Pradesh”, Shrivastav said.

Representative image

CHENNAI: The nip in the air and the holiday season is making it the best playtime for children, but it is also landing many children in bed for respiratory and viral infections. Many adults, too, are opting to work from home with hot soups, rasam and power naps as viruses spread in winter.

Doctors see long queues outside their clinics and high occupancy of beds in their children’s wards. The chill in December months harbours viruses, unlike the warmth during the rest of the year. “Almost every patient walking into the hospital complains of cough, cold, or wheezing triggered by viruses,” said paediatrician Dr S Balasubramanian, medical director, Kanchi Kamakoti Childs Trust Hospital. “It not only lasts long, but also sends some children to ICUs following complications of pneumonia,” he said.

Doctor don’t often verify the strain unless patients develop complications. Many children moved into ICUs tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which causes infections of the lungs and the respiratory tract. “It is more common in children, particularly premature babies, infants and those with a weak immune system,” he said. While most of the children recover in a few days with medication, a few need ventilator support.

Signs and symptoms of RSV appear about four to six days after exposure to the virus. In adults and older children, the symptoms mimic common cold — congested or runny nose, dry cough, low-grade fever, sore throat and mild headache. “I was feeling tired and just wanted to stay in bed,” said S Kavya, a law student, infected by the virus.

Kavya was lucky. In some people, the infection spreads to lower respiratory tract, causing pneumonia or bronchiolitis — inflammation of the small airway passages entering the lungs. “It leaves them with fever, severe cough, wheezing with other secondary infections that may require antibiotics,” said Dr P Kuganandam of SIMS Hospital.

While there are no vaccines in the market against most viruses, public health experts say washing hands frequently, limiting contact with people who have fevers or cold and properly discarding used tissues can help prevent spread of infections. Smoking can aggravate symptoms.

NEW DELHI: A day after recording the coldest winter day in 118 years, Delhi had some respite from the biting cold on Tuesday. Both the minimum and the maximum temperature went up by a few degrees, owing to strong easterly winds .India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said that with wind speeds increasing to around 15 km/hr, dense fog formation was prevented on Tuesday, allowing sunlight to come through in the afternoon.Easterly winds will continue to influence Delhi in the next 24 hours due to an active western disturbance, which will lead to a further increase in temperature on January 1. However, chances of rain and hailstorm impacting the capital have gone down, they added.“While we had initially forecast a spell of light rain on January 1, this now appears unlikely. On January 2, while Uttar Pradesh may see some hail activity, only isolated parts in Delhi will now record hail,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at the regional meteorological centre.Delhi’s minimum temperature, which had fallen down to 2.9 degrees Celsius on Monday, increased to 4.8 degrees due to the easterly winds. The maximum which was the lowest in 118 years at 9.4 degrees also increased to 14.7 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. This made it the 18th consecutive ‘cold-day’ Delhi has been recording since December 14, Met officials said.“Severe cold day or cold day conditions prevailing over Delhi-NCR since December 14 left behind a record of 13 consecutive days which were recorded in December of 1997,” said Srivastava.IMD classifies it as a “cold day” when the maximum temperature is four or more degrees below normal.Srivastava said the mean maximum temperature (MMT) for December 2019 has been 18.8 degrees Celsius, making it the second coldest December since 1901.Lodhi Road recorded Delhi’s lowest minimum temperature on Tuesday at 3.7 degrees Celsius, while Mungeshpur recorded the lowest maximum at 11.6 degrees Celsius. Forecast for Wednesday shows Delhi’s maximum and minimum could rise even further, touching 17 and 6 degrees Celsius respectively.On Monday, Delhi’s maximum temperature which stood at 9.4 degrees Celsius was the lowest ever winter temperature recorded since IMD started keeping records in 1901.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73052876,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-578818,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chances-of-rain-on-day-1-of-2020-recede-relief-from-biting-cold/articleshow/73051822.cms

Nirmala Sitharaman

GANDHINAGAR: The report of the task force on the National Infrastructure Pipeline (2019-2025), released by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, for the projected $1.4 trillion (Rs.102 lakh crore) spending on infrastructure does not have projections of investment in infrastructure in Gujarat , as the state government did not care to provide inputs to the task force.

The report states, “Large states yet to provide adequate data (on investment in infrastructure) are Gujarat, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Bihar. Projected peak in annual phasing of investment spend in FY20-21, however, could spill over to FY23-25. Conceptual stage projects include expressways, freight corridors, river inter-linking and renewable energy .”

The report also projected that by 2030, Gujarat’s urbanization level will cross the 50% mark. “By 2030, it is estimated that 5 states – Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Punjab – will have >50% urbanisation. Also, the number of metropolitan cities in India is estimated to increase from 46 according to the 2011 census to 68 in 2030. Plugging the deficiency in infrastructure will smoothen the process of urbanization by promoting ease of living and facilitating economic activity. It will thus help in realizing the full potential of the growing urban economy and raise its contribution to GDP,” the report noted.

To achieve this objective, a task force was constituted to draw up the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) for each years from FY 2019-20 to FY 2024-25, with the approval of the finance minister.

Nitin Patel, deputy chief minister and the state government spokesperson, was contacted several times to ask why Gujarat stayed away from sharing data with the government of India on investment in infrastructure in the state, but he did not respond.

Bhubaneswar: Renowned publisher, chairman and editor-in-chief of Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group Sonny Mehta died in New York on Monday. Mehta, brother-in-law of chief minister Naveen Patnaik and husband of well-known author Gita Mehta, was 77.

The news broke after Naveen took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to express his condolences. “I am deeply grieved by the passing away of my brother in law Sonny Mehta (Husband of my sister Gita Mehta). He was one of the world’s best editors and an extremely civilized person. May his soul rest in peace,” he tweeted. The bereaved chief minister also asked his supporters and well-wishers not to visit his residence to greet him on New Year on Wednesday, said an official communication from the chief minister’s office.

Son of a diplomat, Mehta headed the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group for more than three decades after joining in 1987. The publishing giant completed its 100 years in 2015.

After completing his schooling at Sanawar School and partially in England, Mehta had graduated from the prestigious Cambridge University. Known as one of the finest editors of the world, Mehta had won many accolades in India, UK and USA. He was named the 2015 Publishers Weekly Person of the Year, said a source in the CMO.

Both Sonny and Gita visited Naveen Niwas, the residence of the chief minister here, in March.

Writers, publishers and leaders mourned Mehta’s death. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also mourned the death of the well-known publisher.

“Sonny Mehta would be fondly remembered by countless avid readers across the world. He endeared himself to many, thanks to his erudite and knowledgable personality. Saddened by his demise. Condolences to Gita Ji, you, your family and his admirers. Om Shanti,” Modi tweeted. In the evening, the Prime Minister also spoke to Naveen over telephone to express his condolence, said CMO sources.

BJP national vice-president Baijayant Panda also took to Twitter to express his condolences over Mehta’s demise. “Deeply saddened at the passing of Ajay Singh Sonny Mehta, world famous publisher & wonderful human being. Condolences to his son, wife Gita, herself an accomplished author, brothers-in-law Prem & @Naveen_Odisha Patnaik, & families. May his soul rest in peace, Om Shanti,” Baijayant wrote on the micro-blogging site.

In his condolence message on Twitter, renowned historian Ramachandra Guha said, “Deeply distressed to hear of the passing of Sonny Mehta. A truly great editor and a wonderfully warm and compassionate human being.”

Special squad of the commissionerate police here on Tuesday arrested Chinmay Sahu, 30, and Gopal Mohanty, 34, for allegedly cheating Sanjay Kumar Sandha, the sub-inspector of Khandagiri police station, while trying to sell him the stolen SUV at a lower price. During investigation, the special squad recovered eight stolen luxury vehicles.

This was perhaps the first time the commissionerate police seized eight stolen luxury vehicles on a single day. Police sources said accused Chinmay Sahu was an MCA degree holder whereas Gopal Mohanty had completed his MBA from a private college in Bhubaneswar. Sahu was staying in a rented house near Sainik School and Mohanty in Nayapalli.

Deputy commissioner of police Anup Kumar Sahoo said seven of the seized vehicles carried West Bengal registration plates while one had an Assam number plate. “We have come to know about another associate of the two accused in Kolkata. They seem to be part of a big gang that has illegal operations (vehicle thefts) in different states. We are in touch with West Bengal police to know details of the gang members in Kolkata,” Sahoo said.

Sandha, the sub-inspector, had lodged a complaint with Laxmisagar police here on December 29 alleging that Sahu approached and urged him to buy an used SUV bearing an Assam registration number at Rs 14 lakh.

In his complaint, Sandha said he paid Rs 8 lakh advance to Sahu and assured to pay the rest only after getting the requisite documents of the vehicles, including NOC from Assam transport authorities. Sandha alleged that Sahu cheated him.

He neither gave the car nor refunded the money, Sandha added.

“Our investigation led to unearthing of a vehicle theft racket. All stolen vehicles carried genuine number plates of other vehicles. We strongly suspect the vehicles were stolen from West Bengal. The chassis numbers of the vehicles were tampered with. We are trying to locate the original owners of the vehicles,” Sahoo said.

Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa

AMRITSAR/LUDHIANA: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) members and Shiromani Akali Dal have sought action against Punjab cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa for his alleged objectionable remarks against the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak Dev.

An SGPC delegation has urged acting jathedar of Akal Takht Giani Harpreet Singh, urging him to take action as per Panthic tradition against Punjab cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. The SGPC delegation also lodged a complaint against the cabinet minister with Amritsar police seeking a case against him under Section 295-A (hurting the sentiments of a community) of the IPC.

SGPC senior vice-president Rajinder Singh Mehta on Tuesday said the delegation handed over a memorandum addressed to the jathedar, seeking action against Randhawa as per Panthic traditions. Mehta said Randhawa had allegedly committed a sacrilege against Guru Nanak Dev. “Everything he spoke is well clear in the viral video,” he said. The SGPC delegation also demanded immediate removal of Randhawa from the cabinet.

SAD senior vice-president Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal said, “A case under Section 295 of the IPC should be registered against Randhawa and the state government should immediately dismiss him from the cabinet. The Congress should apologise to the Sikh sangant for the act.”

Grewal said, “A case was registered within no time when the Christian community complained of sacrilege in Ajnala. And here a senior minister in the Congress government is being protected even though there is enough evidence to register a case. The statement of Randhawa that it is a “ doctored video” can be and should be verified.”

He said, “It’s most unfortunate that the Congress government has miserably failed in protecting the sentiments of the Sikh faith.”

368,['1/01/2020'],How music can unite us this year,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Ahmedabad will begin the New Year with inaugural hymns rendered by the stalwarts of India’s classical music. Saptak, the country’s longest music conference — spanning 13 days — begins on January 1. TOI speaks to three musicians who will perform at the event.

The themes for their recitals read like programme notes for a cultural phenomenon unique to India: harmony of not only notes but of spiritual energies and of everyday lives of the common people.

“Like flowers, air, water, fire, fragrance, and colours, music doesn’t belong to any religion,” sarod god Ustad Amjad Ali Khan told TOI. “Music and sound connect the world. Language creates barriers. Even today, in the 21st century, we are killing each other because of religion. But swar hi ishwar hai, har raga mein ek atma hai (the musical note is God, every raga contains soul).”

The ustad, who performs at the final baithak on January 3, went on to say: “My family and I feel we belong to all religions of India and the world.”

The Mohan Veena divinity, Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, presented the same flourish of hope. “The seven musical notes are common across the world,” Pandit Bhatt told TOI. “Otherwise, there are so many differences — of religions, cultures, and languages. But music can bring peace and love to the world.” Pandit Bhatt’s recital is scheduled on January 12.

“Music knows no religion, language, or boundaries,” Viraj Amar told TOI. She is an Ahmedabad vocalist and a disciple of Banaras Gharana titans Pandits Rajan and Sajan Mishra. “Music knows only love and peace; and the intrinsic need of all living beings is ultimately love,” she said. Her recital is on January 3 at the first baithak.

KOLKATA: A woman allegedly hit her mother on her head with a hammer after a disagreement between the two on Tuesday morning. The mother-daughter duo had returned to their Salt Lake home from Bengaluru last week. Her father, a former engineer, was not at home when the incident took place.

Officers of Bidhanagar South police station went to the spot after neighbours informed them and shifted the injured woman, in her mid-60s, to a hospital and detained the daughter. According to the cops, the accused was grappling with a few psychological issues. “The family had shifted to Bengaluru a few years ago where the daughter works. They returned to their home last week,” said an officer.

Security guards and neighbours informed the cops that they heard the mother and daughter quarrelling on Monday night as well as on Tuesday morning. “When we reached the spot we found the mother lying in a pool of blood and the daughter sitting beside her with a hammer. She admitted that she had attacked her mother,” said the officer, adding that the father had left home a couple of days ago after a quarrel with the daughter. “Her mother had suffered injury on her head. Her condition is critical,” said the officer.

AHMEDABAD: In connection with the Rs 900-crore fake billing scam , the enforcement wing of the state goods and services tax ( SGST ) department arrested Paresh Nathalal Chauhan on Monday evening. Chauhan, an Ahmedabad businessman, was found to be operating 72 shell companies, 36 of which were registered under the value added tax (VAT) regime and the remaining were registered under the goods and services tax (GST) regime.Chauhan was produced before a local court in Ahmedabad on Tuesday and the department sought his remand for 14 days. According to SGST department officials, Chauhan had created bogus bills worth Rs 900 crore which were used to evade taxes to the tune of Rs 100 crore. Bogus bills worth Rs 427.28 crore were made under the GST regime with which Rs 60.73 crore in taxes were evaded.The department had been probing the case since October 2019 and Chauhan had been absconding till then.“Since one person can’t be operating 72 companies, we expect the involvement of more people. The investigation is still under way,” said C M Trivedi, additional commissioner, SGST department. “When the firms operated by Chauhan were investigated, several incriminating documents, pen drives, and hard disks were found.”Trivedi said that investigating officers suspect that the fake bills were circulated to companies within and outside Gujarat.After the new tax regime was rolled out, fake billing scams have been on the rise.

372,['1/01/2020'],Punjab: Brace for another rise in power tariff in April,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Representative image

PATIALA: After a 30 paise per unit hike in power tariff, the electricity consumers in Punjab are staring at another rise in electricity rates within next three months. The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has filed a petition with the state power regulator seeking a 14% increase in tariff for the next fiscal to balance the revenue and expenditure. The recent rise in the price was on the account of PSPCL shelling out Rs 1,490 crore to pay private power companies as coal washing charges.

In the annual revenue requirement (ARR) petition before the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC), the discom has submitted that there was a need to generate Rs 37,250 crore in the next financial year. It would leave a gap of Rs 4,545 crore in its balance sheet and as the power corporation has no other means gather funds, it wants the cost of power to go up by 14%.

PSERC has asked the power corporation to furnish some additional details after which it would be holding a public hearing before announcing the next hike in April. There is also a carry forward of Rs 7,728 crore from the previous years and the accumulated deficit as on March 31, 2020, would be around Rs 11,179.66 crore. The corporation has bifurcated this amount over the next two years to avoid a massive hike in power tariffs.

Last year, PSPCL had sought an 8% to 14% hike on various categories of consumers. However, the regulator had allowed only 2.14% hike, after which the energy charges for various categories of domestic consumers increased by 8 paise a unit and now stands between Rs 4.99 and Rs 7.11 per unit (depending on usages and load). For non-residential power supply, the cost had increased by 5 paise per unit, and the cost of power for the industries was increased by 8-10 paise per unit.

As the regulator has allowed a 30 paise hike for domestic connections and 29 p a unit for industrial connections, which would be charged during the next 12 months beginning January 1, the next hike could swell the power cost by more than half a rupee per unit. As per the AAR, the average cost of power now is Rs 6.62 per unit and PSPCL has sought to raise it this figure Rs 7.26 per unit for next fiscal.

PSPCL has tried to balance out the increase by proposing a 15% reduction in the energy charges for the domestic category for the first 100 units, besides requesting the regulator not to cross-subsidise the agricultural power supply.

To improve its financial health, the power corporation has also requested the regulator to issue 75% amount of the power subsidies in the first half of the year, and the remaining 25% in the last six months. At present, the government is supposed to pay the power subsidies in 12 equal instalments to the PSPCL.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has decided to go for dedicated highway patrol teams at night with armoured mini-trucks to crack down on robbers . The northwest district police is the first to start with five patrolling teams.

Tata 407 vans, which were earlier used by Delhi Police mainly to transport barricades and move personnel, have been modified with a hatch-mounted firing port and a specially designed armour to protect personnel from bullets or stones thrown by criminals during a chase. Nine personnel, who are part of each unit, are equipped with long-range weapons such as AK-47s, INSAS rifles and MP5 guns.

“We realised that the vehicles were underutilised and decided to give them a makeover. The vehicles were painted and fitted with reflective strips and a siren. The roof has been cut open on two sides to allow officers to stand for a bird’s-eye view of the area they are patrolling. Each of our five subdivisions has one such vehicle now,” said Vijayanta Arya, DCP (northwest).

The vans, which have been patrolling the areas for the past two weeks, can be spotted from a distance around GT Karnal Road, Madhuban Chowk, Britannia Chowk, Mukarba Chowk and other roads leading to the highways even during fog because of their luminous paint. The officers, who wear reflective jackets, are also equipped with riot gears and ropes to handle any law and order situation.

A drop in the number of calls regarding heinous crimes during the night has been visible since the patrolling has started, an officer claimed.

Delhi Police also has a fleet of motorcycles patrolling the roads. But the decision to go for the armoured vans was taken after it was noticed that because of the fast moving carriageways in northwest Delhi, robbers, such as those from Mewat, were having an easy escape. The low visibility during the fog season is also used by robbers as a cover. Now the vans, on the road from the midnight to the wee hours, are increasing the police presence on the highways.

In his resignation letter, Kotli said the party workers who were not behaving like sycophants were being insulted and party leadership was not sincere to the Dalit movement. He has said that he would continue working as an ordinary worker of the party as he had been doing for the last 34 years. Kotli was BSP Phagwara nominee in 2012 assembly elections and Jalandhar candidate in the 2014 parliamentary polls.

Two days ago, state general secretary Makhan Singh and over a dozen other office-bearers of various districts resigned from their offices. They had hosted former Delhi MLA Sandeep Valmiki, who had been expelled from party. Meanwhile, Valmiki also attended a programme at Phillaur on Tuesday where Kotli was also present.

When asked, Punjab BSP unit president Jasbir Singh Garhi rubbished Kotli’s allegations. Garhi also said he got Kotli appointed as the state secretary and then also included him in the panel which would represent the party at important platforms to take up different issues.

AHMEDABAD: Only one person working 24x7 at a closed hospital in Surat, resulted in the rejection of insurance claims made for repeated hospitalizations.

Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission quashed orders passed by the Surat consumer forum ordering Apollo Munich Health Insurance Co Ltd to pay consumers for hospitalizations in 2010-11 at one particular hospital.

The consumer commission quashed an order for payment of Rs 30,000 and Rs 24,000 to Shailesh Italiya for his two stints at Panchratna Hospital in the Udhna area. The commission upheld the insurance company’s claim that the hospital had been locked for nearly six months when Italiya claimed repeated hospitalizations for malaria.

The commission said that just one person is shown monitoring the patient for more than a week every time. The monitoring sheet reflected that it was filled in by the treating person. He was the only one who attended to the patient for 24 hours every day. This continuous monitoring by one person is not possible for 11 days. This showed that this was a fraudulent claim.

The commission observed this while reversing the forum’s order on claims made by a couple of other persons as well. Suresh Koshia’s wife was hospitalized at the same hospital, for which he claimed Rs 24,000, and later Rs 16,000 for his daughter’s hospitalization.

Similarly, Arvind Lukhi’s wife was admitted to the hospital in May 2011 for malaria. The forum ordered the insurer to pay the expenses, but the commission quashed the order only on the grounds that it was not believable that only one person could continuously attend to the patient for days together.

Delhi’s air quality returned to the “very poor” category on Tuesday. (File photo)

NEW DELHI: After recording three consecutive days of “severe” pollution , Delhi’s air quality returned to the “very poor” category on Tuesday. The overall Air Quality Index ( AQI ) was 387 as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.

Delhi’s AQI had touched 446 on Monday – a day when Delhi recorded dense fog and its lowest maximum temperature in 118 years. Experts say an increase in wind speed has helped disperse pollutants and prevent dense fog formation, and pollution levels are likely to go down further in the next 48 hours.

Track the pollution level in your city

“Wind speeds have increased to around 15 km/hr, helping in the dispersal of fog and pollutants. Easterly winds are expected to continue influencing the region in the next couple of days, which will lead to a rise in temperature that will check pollution. Wind speeds could pick up to 20-25 km/hr on January 2, so further improvement is expected,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional centre.

The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) says “very calm” wind conditions, which had been prevailing over the last three days, have finished and wind speed is expected to increase further. “The AQI is forecast to improve to the middle-end of the very poor category by the New Year day. Further significant improvement in AQI towards the lower-end of very poor to poor category is expected by January 2,” said SAFAR.

The top three pollution hotspots for Wednesday are likely to be Badarpur, AIIMS/Adarsh Nagar and Rohini.

Data according to the CPCB’s central control room showed a significant dip in Delhi-NCR’s average PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: The universities in the capital had a particularly eventful year in 2019. While protests overwhelmed Jawaharlal Nehru University at frequent intervals, Delhi University and Jamia Millia Islamia too saw a lot of ferment. The ripple effect was felt in several other institutes of higher education . Academic activities, even exams, made way for heated arguments about both institutional administration and national policies.JNU was the theatre of the most strident protests. If the fight against the ban on entry to the Parthasarathy Rocks and the legal drama surrounding the students’ union polls were raucous enough, the real furore began on October 28, when the students stood up against the hike in hostel fees. It was a stand-off that caught attention across India and caused a headache for the Union human resource ministry.The hostel fees issue took on the dimension of “commercialisation of education” and “anti-student government policies” and students across the country lent support to the fight. After the talks between the JNU administration and the rebels reached a deadlock, the HRD ministry stepped in, but it too failed to resolve the issues as December rolled into 2020. The confrontation at the university reached a high point with the students boycotting the semester examinations, forcing the administration to scramble for alternative means such as conducting exams on WhatsApp and email. Such ideas only earned the scorn of the teachers, who by and large also wrangled with the authorities through the year.In Delhi University, teachers gave protest a new meaning on December 4 by storming the vice-chancellor’s office, housed in what was once the abode of ultimate authority, the Vice Regal Lodge. The cause of war was the termination of ad hoc teachers. DU ’s letter of August 28 mandated only the appointment of guest teachers against vacancies arising for the first time in the current academic session, leading to halting of salaries of a few. Though the HRD ministry offered relief to the university’s ad hoc teachers last week, the issue of their absorption may perhaps find resolution only in 2020.In between, there was a hubbub in October over the alleged whitewashing of the Azadi Wall at Ambedkar University Delhi, proudly painted till then in the rainbow colours of the LGBTQIA community.As the year came to an end, the focus turned to Jamia Millia University, where a series of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens led to violence on December 15 and alleged illegal presence of police on the campus. Initially called by Jamia teachers, the protest rode on student power to gain mass following across the country. Several institutions, including IIT-Delhi, and eminent individuals rose up in solidarity. Among them, alumnus Rahul Roy said, “I am proud that Jamia is where the movement against CAA began.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73055927,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-535467,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/action-replay-2019-from-new-laws-to-new-lows-campuses-burn/articleshow/73051858.cms

Lekhi argued that the

protesters

were being misguided by Opposition.

NEW DELHI: Meenakshi Lekhi , the BJP MP from New Delhi, on Tuesday started her election campaign in Delhi Cantonment assembly constituency by advocating the Citizenship Amendment Act .More than a thousand people had gathered at Kranti Chowk , in Sadar Bazar to hear the arguments of Lekhi and several senior ex-servicemen, including lieutenant general JBS Yadav, regarding CAA, which has caused controversy and led to agitations across the country.Lekhi argued that the protesters were being misguided by opposition parties and CAA only favoured persecuted minorities from neighbouring Islamic countries. She pointed out that no new refugees were covered by CAA, while also alleging that the protests had a foreign hand behind them. She compared the problems faced by minorities in these countries with“ISIS-like brutalities”.“CAA is for the oppressed minorities facing atrocities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Twitter trends show that foreign powers are involved in the protests. Two Twitter trends were running last night. While #IsupportCAA was being run by users from within India, another trend saying India doesn’t support CAA was being run by users in Pakistan and parts of America and Africa,” Lekhi said.The MP said, “Anti-social elements had instigated riots and set afire public property. Opposition parties have been saying that your citizenship is being threatened, but CAA is not going to affect any Indian citizen. There have been instances of forced conversions, religious violence and destruction of places of worship in the neighbouring countries. These persecuted people are being helped by giving some relaxations through this law.”Lekhi urged each person in the gathering to make at least 10 people understand the provisions of CAA. “Rumours are being spread regarding National Register of Citizens, which is going to be implemented to prevent intruders from entering India and carrying out acts of terror,” she added.Citing the example of persecuted Jews to support her argument, Lekhi said, “There has been significant fall in the number of minorities in the neighbouring countries. When Jews faced such persecution, a large number of countries gave them citizenship. Nobody at that time argued that Christians should also be given citizenship by these countries. If there is no equal persecution, there cannot be equal rules for relaxation in citizenship norms.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73055989,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-539101,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lekhi-makes-poll-pitch-by-rooting-for-new-law/articleshow/73051866.cms

AHMEDABAD: Did you know how your past smelt or what sounds are attached to it? Do only old dilapidated intricately carved wooden havelis qualify as heritage? How do odours, sights or sounds stir collective memories and help a community engage with its own culture and history?To find answers to these questions, a joint team of students from Cept University and University of New South Wales, Australia, explored Zaveriwad , one of the oldest areas in Ahmedabad’s Walled City, and asked local residents to recall their memories of smells, sounds and voices from their past. Recordings were kept of the responses.The researchers found that traffic sounds were increasingly drowning all ambient noises at Sambhavnath ni Pol, Ambli Pol, Waghan Pol and Chaumukhji ni Pol covered under the study – making them indistinguishable from other parts of the city. In earlier times one usually heard the chirping of birds from the bird feeders (chabutara) sounds of women making meals and the usual chatter at the crossroads in the pols. A few also remembered the jeweller workshops and the sounds of the ‘derasar’ (Jain temple) where locals prayed and performed rituals.“Memory is a powerful tool that stays with people even when the tangible heritage is gone. We learned that many citizens, now settled elsewhere in Ahmedabad, still identify themselves with their respective pols. It distinguishes Ahmedabad, making it a living and breathing heritage city,” said Gauri Bharat, associate professor and head of the architectural history programme at Faculty of Architecture, Cept University.The students were exploring processes for identification, protection and conservation of these sensory experiences.Bharat said the area was selected for its rich history and Jain traditions. “The students talked to locals about their memory in terms of sound and sights. One of the responses recorded that a man had associated his pol with sounds of a next-door derasar and the trains at Kalupur which could be heard distinctly during quieter night hours,” she said.A group of students also mapped the distribution of activities in the area and studied the local culture and ethos. An exhibition based on the project was organized recently at Chaumukhji ni Pol.A pictorial representation of various pols by the Australian students mapped day-to-day activities, oft-spoken phrases and distinctive features such as subterranean derasar offering visitors a view of only the face of the Tirthankar. Participants said that Jain sadhvis explained the socio-religious nature of the area.Prof Ramji Savaliya, the former director of the BJ Institute of Learning and Research, said that the area is distinct in the history of Walled City of Ahmedabad due to its association with prominent citizens such as Shantidas Zaveri and affluent jewellers. “Even during the Mughal era, one finds records mentioning guards outside the pols for the security of the ‘wealth of the city.’ The area has retained some of its features even today,” he said.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73054728,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-455493,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/delving-into-sounds-smells-of-heritage/articleshow/73051876.cms

Arignar Anna Zoological park in Vandalur

CHENNAI: With vacations for schools and colleges and ahead of the new year holiday, Vandalur zoo, among the favourite leisure destinations for many in the city, has been registering high footfalls over the past couple of days. On Sunday , the zoo received 28,000-plus visitors — the highest in the last three years.

Zoo managers attribute the spike in the number of visitors to the holidays of educational institutions and to the opening of the Otteri lake on the zoo premises. The lake has turned into a major attraction, said an official.

Talking about the number of visitors, the official said during the same day last year, 16,212 people visited the zoo. In 2017, the number of visitors was only 10,463. This year, the zoo received 28,262 visitors on December 29, a 77% rise, compared to 2018. Compared to the 2017 number, the rise is 174%, said the official.

In the last 10 days, the zoo received 1.32 lakh visitors. It was 1.06 lakh last year and the year before last, it was only 96,000. This clearly showed that the zoo has turned into a major attraction for visitors, said an official.

To provide better facilities to visitors, the zoo has hired two more battery-operated carts, another official said. It already has a dozen of them. These include eight battery carts with a seating capacity of 14, three with a capacity of eight seats and a six-seat cart. Except for the six-seat vehicle, the rest are used for public transportation. The six-seater is for visits by the director and deputy director with range officers to inspect various works.

NEW DELHI: Thieves broke into a post office and got less than what they bargained for. They broke a safe and fled with a cash bag from Mansarovar , only to find that the bag contained a measly Rs 487 in coins that was left by the cashier the previous day.

Police said the men drilled a hole in the wall behind the safe, and suspect that they might have been helped by a child who worked at the office gate. The place had no security guards at the time of the incident, they added.

The officials discovered the theft on Monday morning when the deputy post master reached the locker room and found it ransacked. During inspection, he spotted the hole dug on the wall. The thieves used an iron rod to open the locker. However, the accountant had emptied it last Friday and had left coins in a bag behind.

In the complaint, the deputy post master told the cops that the office was shut around 5.30pm on Saturday. The cops suspect that the thieves would have scaled the boundary wall behind the building to gain entry. They added that hole in the wall was more than 15 inches thick, which would have taken the accused at least an hour to drill.

A case of trespassing and burglary has been registered and a probe initiated. Police said there were no CCTV cameras focused on the area through which the thieves gained entry into the office.

NEW DELHI: Traffic diversions at Kalindi Kunj in the wake of the protests against Citizenship Amendment Act have made travelling between Delhi and Noida a nightmare.

DND Flyway and the Chilla route in Noida have witnessed a sudden rise in the volume of traffic given that over three lakh vehicles use them via the Mahamaya-Kalindi Kunj road on a weekday. Commuters get regularly stuck in snarls on the DND-Maharani Bagh stretch. A pileup on DND has become a regular feature, even during non-peak hours.

Delhi Police is now trying to explore the option of opening one carriageway of Kalindi Kunj road. Residents of Shaheen Bagh, who have been blocking the road for the past two weeks with the help of grilles uprooted from the central median, have refused to vacate the stretch and shift their protest to another location.

Last week, police had roped in local religious leaders to reach a settlement with the protesters. Senior officers said a forceful removal would spark tension in the area that has already been volatile since the violence at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 15. Most protesters TOI spoke to were adamant about not shifting to another location since they felt that moving away from Kalindi Kunj road would dilute their cause.

Vehicles going towards Noida are being diverted through Mathura Road to reach Ashram and take DND Flyway. To avoid the mess at Ashram, many drivers have been taking a detour via Noida Link Road from Akshardham. However, even this route gets choked during peak hours since it caters to most of the traffic from east Delhi.

Apart from cars, more than 5,000 trucks heading to Okhla Industrial Area pass through Kalindi Kunj. They are now being diverted through Ashram leading to a mess at the crossing due to the construction of an underpass going towards Nizamuddin.

Traffic police said the jams on DND Flyway are being caused by a 50% increase in the volume of vehicles travelling between Noida and Delhi. “Opening one carriageway will partially reduce this snarl,” said a police officer.

Commuters complained that their travelling time has more than doubled. Sanjay Sinha, a mechanical engineer from Noida working with a private firm in Jasola Vihar, would usually leave home around 9am to reach office 30 minutes later. However, these days he’s been leaving by around 7am. He manages to make it to work just in time.

The resultant delay has had a cascading effect on working hours. A few private firms have asked employees who come late to work to make up for the lost time by staying back in the evening. Those travelling to Jasola, Okhla, Sarita Vihar, Mithapur and Jaitpur are the most troubled as they have to take long detours.

RK Shahi, who has been taking an 18-km detour to reach his office in Faridabad Sector 24, said, “I have to travel from Greater Noida to Eastern Peripheral Expressway and reach my office through several rural areas. The distance from my home to office is 57km via Kalindi Kunj. After the diversion, it is now 75km.”

Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will provide sanitary pads to all needy students free of cost and disposal units at its schools.

The decision was taken after a survey conducted by NGO Amhi Amchya Arogyasathi.

Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI sanitary pads will be provided to around 3,500 students and disposal units to around 28 schools. “The NGO, after interacting with girl students in all NMC schools, had noticed that many girls skip school during menstruation cycle. To curb absenteeism due to this, Amhi Amchya Arogyasathi suggested providing sanitary pads to girl students free of cost. NMC will start providing sanitary pads as much as possible from now onwards. Schools will be allotted stock by making budgetary provisions from next fiscal,” he said.

Joshi said the NGO has also suggested improvements in the condition of toilets, which too will be done as early as possible.

Chairperson of women and child welfare consultative committee Sangita Girhe said she would explore possibilities to provide funds for free sanitary pads and disposal units from available the allocation for the committee.

Meanwhile, the civic body, in association with the NGO, organized an interactive session at Sane Guruji High School on Friday. Team leaders from all schools, education officer Priti Mishrikotkar, headmasters/headmistress, teachers etc were present. All presented their demands before the NMC officials and office-bearers.

Amhi Amchya Arogyasathi has already started to conduct workshops in NMC schools to spread awareness about various issues concerning girl students under its drive — ‘Nai Disha’. The NGO is working in various parts of Gadchiroli district for the same cause for the last few years.

Pune: The city streets saw a surge of all things bright and flashy as thousands of Punekars stepped out of their homes, dressed in their best, to ring in the New Year with friends and family.

Twinning the spirit of the people, establishments across the city were also steeped in glittering lights to woo patrons.

Some arterial roads, including MG Road, JM Road and FC Road, were also bedecked, with fairy lights twinkling on street furniture and trees. Balloons could be seen bobbing over a sea of people as numerous vendors positioned themselves by the streets. LED balloons, LED hairbands, glow headbands, halos and many items found space on the pavements as the street hawkers reached the spot sensing good business.

While a number of people opted to enjoy parties away from the city or at various hotels and restaurants, many preferred to celebrate at home to avoid chaos. IT professional Snehal Ghate (25), who hails from Amravati, will be ringing in the New Year away from home for the first time. She plans to celebrate with her three flatmates in Baner. “My roommates and I have organized a small celebration just among the four of us. Since this is my first New Year away from my family, I thought I would be miserable but I am thankful, that they are around and we will celebrate it together, by cutting cake and wine. It will be like welcoming the New Year with my new family,” she said.

Clubs across the city saw patrons waiting to get into the party mood as loud music boomed in the surrounding areas. Local resident Prashant Pawar said, “My friends have come to Pune from various cities this year. Instead of having a house party, we are going clubbing to ring in the New Year. We have booked a car and driver so that we don’t have to drive in an intoxicated condition.”

NEW DELHI: Crowd management by Delhi Police, which included handling violent confrontations, had to be intensified this year as the number of major protests rose to 94 compared with around 70 in the previous years. Social media and rumours fuelled flare-ups, the intensity of which police failed to anticipate, leading to loss of public property.“We adopted laid-down procedures and a graded approach in dealing with protests. However, managing rumours and social media was a major challenge,” accepted Delhi Police PRO Mandeep Singh Randhawa. With Jantar Mantar off-limit, protesters gathered in other parts of the city and the demonstrations escalated after police stopped them from marching to the high-security zones in Lutyens’ Delhi.The biggest challenge to police came in December when the Citizenship Amendment Act evoked intense passions. At Jamia Millia Islamia, half a dozen buses were burnt or damaged and police clashed with students. There were similar confrontations in Seelampur and Daryaganj.The first violent protest occurred in August when police tried to disperse a group of doctors protesting against the National Medical Commission Bill on Aurobindo Marg in south Delhi. In the ensuing clash, several doctors and policemen were injured.Later that month, there was violence when the cops failed to anticipate the magnitude of resentment after a Guru Ravidas temple built on government land was demolished. Protesters not only blocked central Delhi for hours, but slipped past security to reach the proscribed temple site. Several passers-by, policemen and protesters were injured in the stone pelting.Retired additional commissioner SBS Tyagi, a veteran of violent protests during his tenure as DCP (New Delhi), said that dealing with demonstrators required patience and a strong approach. “No matter what, the protesters must be made aware of the limit they shouldn’t cross. Anyone trying to break the law should be dealt with accordingly,” he added.Delhi Police faced the test in a clash with lawyers at Tis Hazari Courts in November. The furious melee led to several police officers being suspended. There were videos going viral on social media showing lawyers thrashing policemen. This was followed by an unprecedented protest by the outraged policemen from the lower ranks, who gathered in strength to demand their senior officers back them instead of taking disciplinary action against them.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73056153,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-482586,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/action-replay-2019-police-force-stretched-found-wanting/articleshow/73051877.cms

Pune: One does not usually associate men in khaki with light-hearted banter. But, the Pune police on Tuesday proved otherwise with a volley of funny tweets and responses.

The police had tweeted, “Charas, Ganja, Meow Meow. #NewYearResolution 2020 madhe he sarva nako bhau! #SayNoToDrugs” (Charas, Ganja, Meow Meow. Don’t include all this in your #NewYearResolution 2020 brother! #SayNoToDrugs).

It was followed by a bone tickling exchange between numerous citizens and the police which earned the latter brownie points from across the country.

A Twitter user responded, “Guys LSD is allowed”, to which the Pune police’s Twitter handle replied, “Tell us where to find it?”

Another Twitter user jumped into the conversation stating, “Agar maine aap logo ko adda bataya toh 10 pudiya meri? Chalega na sir?” (If I tell you where it is sold, I’ll take 10 packets? Is that okay sir?). The police continued with their witty comebacks. It said, “Aap saare rakh lena. Hum bas aapko rakh lenge. Chalega na sir?” (You keep everything. We will keep you. Is that okay sir?)

In another conversation that stemmed from the tweet, a user said, “Mujhe bhi chahiye” (Even I want it) and the response stated, “Your place or ours?” The user replied, “Your place is just like one-way ticket like God’s place”, to which the department said, “We promise to be great hosts.”

Another user joined in on the conversation saying, “I love and prefer GSD (German Shephard Dog)”. The police replied, “Paw’sibly the best choice indeed.”

The original tweet and responses garnered hundreds of likes and retweets from across the country. A Twitter user said, “This thread is simply outstanding. It is a lesson for all police departments of our country how to engage with the youth.” Another user said, “You’ve won the internet today.”

The thread left citizens wondering who was engaging in the conversation from the police.

The Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham said, “There is no one person behind these tweets. The Pune police must be credited for this. Sometimes they run the tweets and responses by me. I, too, was following the conversation on Twitter on Tuesday, alongside my work.”

Pune: Fourteen employees of Noble Hospital, including nurses, were trapped in a lift at a commercial complex located at Hadapsar on Tuesday morning. The fire brigade personnel rescued them around 10am, after a two-hour ordeal.

The four-storied commercial complex, located near Noble Hospital, consists of hospital units, a nursing hostel and shops.

The maximum carrying capacity of the lift is eight persons. However, 14 people residing in the hostel had entered the lift together. The lift was on its way to the ground floor when it was trapped between the first and second floors around 8am.

The alarm raised by the people trapped in the lift created a panic situation in the complex. The complex authorities responsible for maintaining the lift pressed technicians into service to bring the elevator to the ground floor but the effort was unsuccessful.

A medical officer from the hospital called the fire brigade around 9am. Since the Hadapsar fire brigade was on emergency duty at Shewalwadi, a fire tender from Kondhwa substation and an ambulance rushed to the spot to handle the emergency situation around 9.22am.

The firemen ensured that there was no ventilation issue in the lift. They also provided water to the people and consoled them, telling them they would be rescued soon.

Fire officer Shivaji Chavan said, “We rushed to the fourth floor and found that the rope of the lift had come out from the pulley. We then sought assistance from the technicians and got the rope fixed to the pulley. Then the lift was slowly brought down and stopped at a distance of 2ft above the ground floor so as to prevent it from crashing to the floor. Finally, all 14 people were able to come out of the lift safely with the help of a stool. No one was injured. ”

Chavan added, “The lift has a capacity of six persons. It can sustain up to 500kg at a time. As many as 14 people, weighing around 1,500kg, had squeezed into the lift disregarding safety instructions. The lift was trapped because the people ignored the safety norms. If they had exercised precaution, the incident could have been averted.”

The hospital shared information of the incident with the fire brigade after an hour, Chavan pointed out. “Had they alerted us immediately, we would have rescued them in the shortest possible time,” he said.

The hospital’s medical director, Dilip Mane, told TOI, “The lift is maintained by the commercial complex, not by Noble Hospital. The lift is also used by private persons. The incident happened because of overloading as the nurses were in a hurry to report to work. The technicians also played a key role in rescuing the nurses from the lift.”

Chennai: A sub-registrar at Tiruttani , about 90 km from the city, has been suspended from service for registering 50 acres in three settlement deeds at an inflated rate of Rs 11 ,191 crore an acre , against the guideline value of Rs 24 lakh an acre.

The property, located in far flung villages in Tiruvallur district, was transferred from one private medical and educational trust to another named slightly differently for a total registered value of Rs 5,61,500 crore for 50 acres. The three settlement deeds were executed on November 29, though the property was attached by the Enforcement Directorate, which means no registration can be done.

Registration department sources on Monday said the inspector general of registration had suspended Tiruttani sub-registrar Selva Kumaran for his role in the transaction, pointing out that even T Nagar would not see land registered for Rs 11,191 crore an acre. A source said those behind the trusts could have sought to inflate the land value to get bank loans. TNN

Amarinder Singh

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab government would not stop students from protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and “other controversial actions of the central government”, but it would also not allow peace in the state to be disturbed , Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has said.

Referring to the proposed January 1 state-wide protest by the Left-aligned student unions against CAA-NRC, Capt Amarinder said on Tuesday that protest was the democratic right of every citizen of India and people, including students, as long as such protests were conducted peacefully.

He said his government was totally opposed to CAA-NRC in view of the “fundamentally divisive and discriminatory” nature of the legislation initiated by the BJP-led government at the Centre.

During an anti-CAA sit-in organised by the Punjab Congress in Ludhiana on Monday, he had reiterated his government’s decision not to allow CAA to be implemented in the state.

Amarinder also urged the student leaders to keep a check for possible infiltration of ‘goonda’ elements among the protesters.

397,['1/01/2020'],Calicut University move to appoint 116 teachers raises eyebrows,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Representative image

KOZHIKODE: The decision of Calicut University to conduct one of the biggest mass appointment of teachers in the state at a time when there is no full-time vice-chancellor at the varsity has raised many eyebrows.

The Left-aligned syndicate is fast tracking the appointment of 116 teachers (24 professors, 29 associtate professors and 63 assistant professors) even as the selection process for appointment of a vice-chancellor is underway. The notification inviting applications for the posts is ready and is expected to be published on Wednesday.

But many academics say that it is not proper to conduct the appointments to such large number of posts when the appointment of the vice-chancellor, who is the chairman of the selection committee, is pending. The new VC appointment is expected to take another three months.

Currently, the vice-chancellor of Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University V Anil Kumar has been given the charge of CU too.

“It is not proper to carry out mass appoitmentsof teachers which have been pending for over 10 years when there is no full-time vice-chancellor. It is morally not correct to carry out the biggest teacher appointment in the history of the varsity without waiting for a full-time vice-chancellor,” UDF-affiliated syndicate member Rasheed Ahammed said. All activities on teacher appointments are being carried out sidelining the recruitment cell, he added.

Pro-UDF Calicut University Teachers Association (CUTA) has written to the governor and chancellor Arif Mohammed Khan urging him to issue a direction to the VC in- charge to stop all proceedings regarding appointment of teachers until a new, permanent VC is appointed by the chancellor.

“We fear that there will be political interference in the appointment of teachers,” Prof T M Vasudevan, president of CUTA, said.

Meanwhile, syndicate member K K Haneefa said that the fears of political interference in teacher appointments were totally unfounded. “As per varsity rules, there is no distinction between a full-time VC and in-charge VC. Around half the teaching posts in the varsity are vacant. This is the reason the varsity has slipped in rankings,” he added.

Representative image

MADURAI: Hotels in Madurai are yet to get enrolled in the ‘ hygiene rating ’ scheme introduced by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) in February 2019. The rating is aimed at allowing consumers to make choices while eating out. Under the scheme, hotels and food production units will be audited by an external agency and their hygiene standards are rated.

It will encourage food businesses to improve their hygiene standards. Hotels are rated between one and five stars, with five being the maximum.

While hotels in some of the districts have already started getting the ratings, hotels in Madurai are yet to make a mark. As many as ten hotels in Chennai have got ratings of four-star and five-star. Four hotels in Tirunelveli, three in Salem, two each in Coimbatore and Dindigul and one each in Tuticorin and Tiruvallur have got ratings so far.

“We conducted two separate sensitization programs for hotels in Dindigul and Kodaikanal. In all, 85 food business operators took part in the meetings. Two hotels from Dindigul applied for it and got five-star rating. We have learnt the rating system and can get ratings for more hotels. Hotel owners will be encouraged to get involved in the process,” said the designated officer for food safety, Dindigul district, Dr K Natarajan.

He said various parametres are taken into consideration during the assessment by a specialized team. They include medical fitness certificate of employees, cleanliness of hotel premises and surroundings, infrastructure and safety gears used by workers. Food will also be tested in a laboratory to ensure quality, he said.

The process starts with self-assessment from the food business operator (FBO), which is verified through physical inspections and validation. FBOs, which get four and five ratings, will be declared as ‘responsible place to eat’ in addition to hygiene rating. Five-star rating is given for scores between 81 and 100 marks. Similarly, four star (61-80 marks), three star (41-60), two-star (21-40) and one-start (20 and below) will be given.

President of Madurai District Hoteliers Association K L Kumar said that they are not aware of the scheme and would get in touch with the food safety officials to get it done, he said.

When contacted, an official from the food safety department said that it is being rolled out in many districts in a phased manner. Those, who have not taken it up so far, will start popularizing it, the official said.

400,['1/01/2020'],Illegal colonies: DDA modifies FAQ answer,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Representative image

NEW DELHI: A single-line answer to a “Frequently Asked Question” regarding conferment of ownership rights to residents of unauthorised colonies on the DDA website , which resulted in a war of words between AAP and the Centre, has now been modified .

Earlier, question number two in the FAQs on PM-UDAY (Prime Minister – Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana) was, “Is this regularisation of unauthorised colonies?” The pithy answer was, “No. This is neither regularisation of unauthorised colonies nor the structures therein.”

AAP had said that while BJP was putting up hoardings near unauthorised colonies saying they were being regularised, the DDA website clearly said PM-UDAY was not about regularisation. On Tuesday, Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri tweeted the modified answer saying that things had now been simplified on the DDA website to make AAP understand the issue.

The modified reply is now much more comprehensive. It says that PM-UDAY is for conferment of property rights to residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies. “The regularisation entails approval of layout plans of the colony, which in turn requires fire clearances of the colony and the properties therein from Delhi Fire Service,” the reply now states.

DDA added that conferment of property rights would allow residents to sell or purchase properties without any hindrance, take loans, get building plans approved, if they want to change anything in the current structure, or construct a house on a vacant plot.

The conferment of ownership rights would also open the possibility of redevelopment. “DDA will come out with relaxed development control norms and incentives in terms of higher FAR so that new development can take place,” DDA added.

Deputy CM Manish Sisodia reiterated that the Centre should make it clear whether it really wants to regularise the unauthorised colonies. “The new 20-sentence explanation on the DDA website is not different in substance from the earlier statement. People will not be happy with empty promises, meetings and hoardings. They should get the registration papers in their hands. The misleading claims amount to deceiving the people,” Sisodia said.

Sisodia also locked horns with Puri on Twitter. “Thank you for such a long answer. Sir, I want to know in brief whether PM-UDAY Yojana is for regularisation of unauthorised colonies or not? Earlier your website made it clear that it is not regularisation of colonies or houses. Now you are also not responding,” he tweeted.

The last time it settled above Rs 40,000 was on August 28, 2019. Analysts said gold prices have risen due to the weakened US dollar. “The US dollar has weakened and usually gold prices remain on the higher side at this time as it is the financial year-end in other countries.

A policeman keeps vigil outside Congress Bhavan on Tuesday night (top) after a mob threw out chairs and broke ... Read More

PUNE: The historical Congress Bhavan in Pune was vandalised by a mob of 20 men, all supporters of Congress MLA Sangram Thopte, on Tuesday.

They were angry that he was not given a ministerial berth in chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s cabinet expansion on Monday.

The building has a deep connect with the freedom movement. Its construction started on October 2, 1938 and the structure was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi on January 26, 1940. It has remained the hub of Congress activity in Pune since then.

Sangram, and his father Anantrao Thopte, have been among the most loyal supporters of the Congress, representing Bhor constituency, some 40km from Pune, for 40 years.

His supporters said Thopte deserved a ministerial berth as his performance in the election had helped the party retain the seat against all odds.

Assistant commissioner of police Sudhakar Yadav, senior inspector Balasaheb Kopnar and other police officials rushed to the spot after a call was made to the police control room.

A police team rounded up 19 men involved in the violence at the spot. The Shivajinagar police were in the process of registering a case of rioting and mischief against all 19.

“They came to Congress Bhavan in cars and SUVs. They had stones and small rocks which they used to damage the doors, window panes, and furniture. We have detained them for questioning,” the police added.

A group of women Congress workers was present in one of the rooms when stones hit the door and landed on the floor of the room.

Popat Patole, a clerk in Congress Bhavan, told TOI that he was at his desk when a stone landed on his table.”It came through the window’s glass pane. It missed my head by a couple of inches,” he added.

The workers pulled out chairs from the rooms on the ground and first floor of the building and threw them on the open ground in front of the large building. All the detained men are from Nasrapur, Bhor, Velhe, Mulshi and other adjoining villages and affiliated to the Congress Party, the police said. A group of local elected members of the Congress, who represent Zilla Parishad and local self-governing bodies, had resigned on Monday. They protested in Bhor city and put up posters condemning the Congress leadership. They also burned Congress banners.

“Action against those who damaged the party’s office will be taken. There can be no violence. The party’s culture does not permit it. The supporters could have approached the high command to resolve the matter,” Ramesh Bagwe, Congress’s city unit chief, said.

Congress functionary Gopal Tiwari said a communication gap between the senior leadership and the local party workers should be filled. “The anger of loyalists should have a mature approach. They have toiled for the party. Communication channels between different levels of party functionaries should be opened so that such reaction from the workers can be better controlled,” he said.

404,['1/01/2020'],"Petroleum ministry allows Vedanta to explore hydrocarbon in Shahjahanpur, Kheri districts","This story is from January 1, 2020

Bareilly: Ministry of petroleum and natural gas has granted permission to Vedanta Limited to explore hydrocarbon in 14 villages of Shahjahanpur and Lakhimpur Kheri districts. ONGC had done a survey in the said villages nearly 30 years ago and a recently concluded lab test in Russia has suggested that there is 95% chance of the presence of hydrocarbon there. If this turns out to be a commercial discovery, it will be the first time for the land-locked state.

A team of experts from Vedanta recently met the villagers in Nahil village of Shahjahanpur district after which they have agreed to give their land on lease for exploration.

The villagers have agreed to give their land for exploration and sign a contract. The villagers have been promised payment for their losses. If the crop of any villager is damaged because of exploration process then he would also be entitled for compensation, officials said.

Vedanta has spotted 10 villages in Kheri while four villages in Shahjahanpur district where they would be exploring the possibility of the presence of natural oil or gas. Nahil, Hardua, Bilsi and Billauri village fall in Shahjahanpur where Vedanta would dig oil wells.

The officials camped in Nahil village on Sunday and shared the details about the project. Jitendra Lal, project officer from Vedanta who camped in Nahil with administrative officials, said, “ONGC had earlier attempted to explore the presence of hydrocarbons but the project was dropped after drilling for nearly 15 days in a few villages, including Nahil of Powayan tehsil, in 1988-89. The samples collected during that time were sent for lab tests. Now after recent test reports from Russia, Vedanta has decided to take up this project and we will do our research work after completing all the formalities. The selected piece of land will be taken on rent from the farmers and they will be compensated for their losses till the time hydrocarbon exploration is done. In case hydrocarbons are not discovered then the land will be returned to farmers in the same condition as it was acquired. The exploration will start after seeking all the necessary permissions from all the departments.”

Ashok Trivedi, a 56-year-old resident of Nahil village who had given his land to ONGC earlier, told TOI, “We are ready to give our land for exploration but we need more clarity on what will happen if oil is discovered from our land. We are definitely very happy that this could be life- changing for each and every individual of the village. We have been promised better life if hydrocarbons are discovered here after digging oil wells.”

ADM (finance) Amar pal Singh said, “The company will select sites within the village where they would start digging wells in the next few months. They have agreed to compensate for losses during the exploration process.”

In 2013, Oil India Ltd (OIL) had found presence of hydrocarbons in the first exploratory well drilled by it in UP under its Ganga Valley Project. The well was being dug near Bilaspur in close-by Rampur district. However, nothing much was heard about it after that and OIL officials were tight-lipped about the results from the well.

MADURAI: Orator and writer Nellai Kannan was booked by the Tirunelveli city police under three IPC sections for hate speech against Prime Minister Narendra Modi , home minister Amit Shah , Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam at an SDPI meeting held at Melapalayam in Tirunelveli city on Sunday.

Melapalayam police booked him under IPC sections 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 505(i)(b) (intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the state or against public tranquillity), and 505 (ii) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes).

As this failed to appease BJP cadres, they protested in front of his house on the Gandhimathi Ammal Sannathi Street and the private hospital where he was admitted on Tuesday afternoon as he complained of chest pain. They demanded to book him under The National Security Act (NSA). The protests were so strong at the hospital that he had to be discharged in an hour. His relatives said he would be taken to a private hospital in Madurai. Tension mounted as DMK, Congress and SDPI cadres gathered in support of Kannan. The police pacified the protesters and also conducted preliminary inquiry with Kannan prior to his hospitalisation.

AIADMK cadres petitioned police commissioner Deepak M Damoor and also beat Kannan’s portrait with slippers and brooms for defaming the CM and deputy CM. A senior police officer said that Kannan was in the hospital last month too and he would be quizzed after he is discharged. “We will take the next step (arrest) if needed,” he added. BJP’s senior leaders in Tamil Nadu will stage a sit-in protest in front of Gandhi Statue on Marina Beach on Wednesday demanding his arrest for instigating Muslims to “finish off” Modi and Amit Shah.

RTR flyover has cut travel time by up to 20 minutes for commuters coming from south Delhi and heading towards ... Read More

NEW DELHI: After a decade-long wait, the Rao Tula Ram ( RTR ) flyover was finally thrown open, bringing relief to lakhs of commuters from snarls that were made worse by the construction work that was under way since 2009.

On July 16, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated the flyover, which cut travel time by up to 20 minutes for commuters coming from south Delhi and heading towards Gurgaon and the airport. Apart from this, the LED streetlights installed on the flyover have also been saving up to 35% electricity.

The new flyover, emerging as an arm of the existing Munirka Flyover and extending up to Central Base Post Office, not only decongested the Poorvi Marg junction, Vasant Marg junction, RTR junction and Benito Juarez Marg junction, but also facilitated the to-and-fro traffic movement from Munirka to the airport. The old RTR flyover reverted to being one-way for traffic coming from the airport and going towards IIT.

The flyover was the first part of the project and the second half of the project includes an underpass at Benito Juarez Marg and the longest skywalk of the city, running alongside the underpass. Officials claim that they would complete the construction work of these two structures by mid-2020.

Construction work of a few projects could not be finished in the year gone by, and they are now estimated to be completed in different months of 2020. One of such projects is the Pragati Maidan Redevelopment Plan, which was hit hard by construction ban.

On the underground parking at Pragati Maidan, a lot of work still needs to be done. The tunnel and the underpasses could not be constructed by December 2019, as officials concerned had claimed earlier. Construction ban also proved to be a hurdle in the smooth implementation of Chandni Chowk pedestrianisation.

Another project that could not take off in 2019 was the streetscaping project. Kejriwal has already announced the names of nine stretches that PWD would be redesigning as per international standards. However, in view of the construction ban and developments so far, it seems unlikely that work on all these stretches will be over even by 2020.

NEW DELHI: A 25-year-old man who was trying to impress his girlfriend by brandishing a pistol, sustained a bullet injury after he accidentally fired at his leg. The man then cooked up a story and told police officers that two people had fired at him when he was in the park.

Police said that Sonu Sharma alias Gandhi was released from jail around a month ago, after three and a half years in a rape case. On December 27, at 11.45pm he was with his girlfriend Priya (name changed) at a park in Tilak Nagar. Sharma was trying to show off his pistol and was waving it when it fired and a bullet hit his leg. The two then rushed to DDU hospital for treatment but did not inform police. Hospital authorities then informed police.

Later, cops questioned Priya and Sharma separately. Priya then told officers that Sharma was drunk and carrying a pistol. On the basis of her statement a case was registered and Sharma was arrested. The weapon was recovered from his friend Manoj (26) who was earlier arrested in an Arms Act case.

The park in Shivpuri will have 500 trees, 15,000 plants, two open gyms and a playing area.

NEW DELHI: For 55 ,000 voters of west Sagarpur ward , this new year awaits a green surprise — a newly-developed park in the middle of a congested Shivpuri . The park with 500 trees, 15,000 plants, two open gyms, a walkway, playing area and gazebos will be inaugurated by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Tuesday.

South Delhi Municipal Corporation has converted a 2.2-acre vacant DDA plot used for dumping C&D waste and garbage into a multi-purpose recreational activity zone. “We have provided around 51 acres of gram sabha land to the three corporations and they have developed 33 beautiful, lush-green parks in their areas,” Baijal said.

Mukesh Suryaan, area councillor, said the gram sabha land in west Sagarpur was taken over by DDA in 2003. “Over time, it was encroached from all sides. Since 2017, we have been pursuing DDA to at least transfer a portion of the land before it gets totally encroached upon,” he said.

After several rounds of correspondence, in February, the authority agreed to give 2.2 acres of 11 acres for developing the park.

“We started the process of reviving the place after removing at least 55 trucks of malba. Later, we levelled the place, planted grass, shrubs and trees,” said Gyanesh Bharti, SDMC commissioner.

“There was a long-pending demand for a park in the area. Earlier, there was no provision for a space for recreation activities. Most people were using open grounds in the neighbouring areas,” said a senior SDMC official.

The park has something for all age groups, claimed the official. “For kids, we have developed a playing area and installed swings. We have also made tracks for joggers, two open gyms and gazebos where senior citizens can sit,” said the official.

This is not the first time that a civic agency has developed vacant land into a park. In the past three years, civic agencies have taken over gram sabha land at 14 places, including Jaunapur, Najafgarh, Dwarka and Govindpuri, and developed parks .

Next in the pipeline is Khel Parisar at Aya Nagar, where the development work is almost complete. It will be thrown open to the public in the first week of January.

Representative image

CHANDIGARH: The average time of an ambulance to reach an accident spot is seven minutes in Haryana. The state government was working to bring this down to three minutes by mapping all ambulances, Haryana transport minister Mool Chand Sharma said on Tuesday. He has directed the health department to compile a data of private ambulances and make it available to the lead agency. He said every ambulance should have a standard format and data bank and exhaustive mapping of ambulances should be done.

Addressing officials during the ‘State Road Safety Council’ meeting here, the minister said level-I services should be provided by the trauma centre, hence the services provided by them should be periodically examined and mapping of private hospitals should also be done.

At the meeting, an action taken report of all the stakeholder departments regarding the decisions taken in the last meeting of the council held on July 9, 2019, was also presented. The minister said that in many places, due to non visibility of the road safety signage, many vehicles are driven on the wrong lane due to which many accidents happen.

Ensuring road safety was the responsibility of everyone and for this it was important to ensure that the necessary signage and boards related to speed limit and nearby trauma centers should be installed in such a way that they were visible from a distance, he added. He said that several signages should be installed on the roads, so that the commuters could be made aware as to where they had to take an accident victim for the treatment. The minister also directed the officers to stop illegal road cuts.

He said in 2020, the government had set a target of reducing the graph of road accidents and casualties. He directed the officials of Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation to put signage and reflectors on the KMP expressway to reduce accidents .

411,['1/01/2020'],Smart City PAPs to receive house rent till they get new flats,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Nagpur: In first-of-its-kind initiative in Vidarbha, the board of directors of Smart City special purpose vehicle — Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) — on Tuesday decided to pay monthly house rent to project affected persons (PAPs) of the scheme till they are given new flats.

The move is likely to expedite works being carried out under the Smart City project.

The NSSCDCL board headed by BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi approved monthly house rent of Rs5,000 for PAPs whose residential structure is below 700 sq ft. PAPs owning residential structure above 700 sq ft will be given an additional amount of Rs7.5 per sq ft along with Rs5,000.

In case of commercial structures, monthly house rent will be Rs10,000 for below 700 sq ft and an additional Rs7.5 per sq ft.

Under the project which covers Pardi, Punapur, Bharatwada and Bhandewadi in East Nagpur, NSSCDCL has started to develop road along with all types of basic amenities like footpath, streetlights, storm & sewage water network, and duct for laying cable under tenderSURE concept at a cost of Rs650 crore. As many as 476 structures need to be acquited for the works.

NSSCDCL has offered compensation to PAPs or new flats with all types of facilities in its housing scheme. Most of the PAPs rejected the compensation offer and demanded new flats. It will take over a year for completion of the housing scheme.

To resolve the issue, Pardeshi directed NSSCDCL officials to interact with PAPs and offer them monthly house rent till completion of housing scheme. PAPs have reportedly accepted the offer.

Accordingly, the NSSCDCL board amended its Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) policy and made provisions of monthly house rent in the meeting.

The NSSCDCL board also approved development of city’s first solar power-based electric vehicles charging station inside Mor Bhavan bus stand at a cost of Rs4.07 crore. It will have the capacity to generate solar power of 120 Kwp. NMC has seven platforms inside Mor Bhavan. Under the new project, 10 more platforms will be constructed. Solar panels will be installed on 17 platforms.

The proposal is part of central government’s plan to run 30% of total vehicles on electric power by 2030. In city, there are 200 electric cabs followed by 1,200 e-rickshaws and five electric-run buses. NMC is planning to procure 40 more electric-run buses.

NSSCDCL will develop the station at Mor Bhavan as a pilot project. Later, NMC will operate and maintain it and develop more stations on the same lines.

The NSSCDCL board approved development of one garbage transfer station in Dharampeth zone on pilot basis. NMC had proposed to develop 10 such stations, one in every zone. NSSDCL took the task to develop one which will be replicated by NMC in remaining nine zones.

The station will be free from garbage and also comprise a material recovery facility (MRF) for transfer of dry waste to recyclers. Garbage collected from households will be brought to the station in a segregated manner and will be transferred into heavy vehicles directly for transport up to Bhandewadi dumping yard.

Board’s other decisions

Funds approved for executing compensatory afforestation scheme under the Forest Act, 1980, for diversion of 2.22 acres forest land for other usage in Smart City area

NMC suggested to replicate tenderSURE in other underdeveloped localities to provide all types of basic amenities at a time and save regular digging of roads

Ahmedabad: Former deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Jetpur division of Rajkot, J M Bharwad, was suspended on December 23, officials of the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) said on Tuesday.

The ACB had on August 3 registered a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act against Bharwad, after a constable, Vishal Sonara, was caught accepting a bribe of Rs 8 lakh on his behalf. ACB officials said Bharwad’s suspension was due to technical reasons and had become final last week. Bharwad’s headquarters will now be the Chhota Udepur SP office.

After evading arrest for three months, Bharwad appeared before the Rajkot ACB on November 8. Earlier, a sessions court in Dhoraji taluka had declared hhim an absconder in connection with the bribery case. Bharwad allegedly demanded Rs 10 lakh to not torture a suspect.

MADURAI: DMK president M K Stalin on Tuesday demanded the state government pass a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CA) and the National Register for Citizens ( NRC ) when the assembly meets on January 6. In a Facebook post, Stalin welcomed the resolution passed by the Kerala assembly asking the Centre to withdraw CAA.

File photo

NEW DELHI: Indore was ranked India’s cleanest city for the fourth time in a row while Kolkata and Howrah came at the bottom of the heap among cities with population of more than 10 lakh in the quarterly Swachhta survey, announced on Tuesday.

In this category, Bhopal stood second in first quarter results (April-June) of Swachh Survekshan League 2020, while Rajkot grabbed the second spot in second quarter (July-September).

The report was released by urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri . The government has launched the Swachh Survekshan League with the aim to ensure that municipal authorities continue taking steps to improve sanitation round the year rather than focussing on only few months to improve their ranking in the Centre’s annual survey.

This time a total of 4,372 cities participated in the league, which included municipal areas with population in the range of less than 25,000 and over 10 lakh.

Interestingly, even in the overall ranking of all cities and towns, Indore emerged as the cleanest during both rounds of the survey. However, while in the first quarter Sursand (Sitamarhi) and Harnaut (Nalanda) in Bihar came last, during the second quarter Kurdemukh in Karnataka and Bedangpet in Telangana finished last in the list. Puri said as more and more cities and towns participate in the Swachhta rankings, now it’s clear that people have started accepting the rankings and every urban area is trying hard to make it to the list of cleanest cities and towns.

Talking to reporters, urban affairs secretary Durga Shankar Mishra said he was confident that all urban areas in West Bengal will be declared open defecation free (ODF) before the New Year (Wednesday) and the state administration has come on board to participate in the next round of Swachhta survey. Highlighting the importance of citizen participation in the survey, Mishra said survey will be conducted from January 4.

“A major thrust of Swachh Survekshan has been on citizen engagement, be it through citizen feedback or indicators involving citizen participation. This year, the citizen-centric focus has been enhanced substantially through verification of the progress made by cities on Swachhata through direct responses from citizens,” he said.

419,['1/01/2020'],GVMC hopes to reclaim top-10 spot in 2020 Swachh rankings,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) wants to leave no stone unturned to put the city back in the top-10 league in Swachh Survekshan 2020 after its disappointing performance in the 2019 survey when the city was at the 29th spot.

SS-2020 is going to be the first litmus test for the civic body in the New Year as survey teams will arrive between January 4 and 31 for observation and to collect feedback from the public on the city’s cleanliness and sanitation levels.

Contrary to the one-time annual survey in January which used to take place earlier, the league component was added to SS-2020. This time, it was conducted in three quarters, April-June, July-September and October-December 2019.

The performance of cities at the league level is crucial to their final ranking as it has 25% weightage in the annual final survey (the second stage of the survey) scheduled to commence from January 4.

The GVMC has lost most marks in the star-rating component as well as the source segregation of garbage in the 2019 survey. Now the GVMC has applied for a five-star rating under the garbage-free cities component of SS-2020.

The total maximum marks set for the star-rating are 1,000. The GVMC has focused more on segregation of garbage at source, which had affected GVMC’s rank in the 2019 survey.

The GVMC UCD wing took resolutions against open defecation and use of single-use plastic from thousands of women self-help groups in the city. The written resolutions covered segregation of waste and home compositing. The major objective of these resolutions is to start a discussion about best sanitation practices among women.

On the other hand, the GVMC will launch 10 selfie booths on Wednesday to create awareness on SS-2020 among the public. It will also set up 50 roll-up standees at shopping malls, restaurants and movie halls. The civic body has made noted personalities of the city and celebrities part of the SS campaign. The SS campaign also covered several educational institutions of the city apart from the campaigning in colonies.

Union minister Jitendra Singh (file photo)

NEW DELHI: To boost the commercial use of civil nuclear energy in the country, the Modi government has decided to commission a nuclear reactor every year.

A 700-MW pressurised heavy water reactor at the Kakrapar nuclear plant in Gujarat is likely to be commissioned by April, Shrikrishna Gupta, a senior official of the Jitendra Singh-led department of atomic energy announced in front of the Union minister here on Tuesday. “Kakrapar-3 is likely to be commissioned in mid-2020. Kakrapar-4 by mid-2021 and RAPP-7 by mid-2022 in Rajasthan ’s Rawatbhata,” he said. The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd’s (NPCIL’s) 22 reactors with an installed capacity of 6780 MW are operational, he said.

The DAE official said, “In nuclear energy programmes, Kaiga-1 (KGS-1) reactor has set 962 days of continuous and non-interrupted operation, which is a world record.” He said the Tarapur atomic power reactors — units 1 and 2 — completed 50 years of operation this year. The two boiling water reactors — the first in the country — were commissioned in October 1969.

“We have also facilitated the use of atomic energy in non-power sectors like agriculture, healthcare, water and environment. In the health sector, Gupta said, “Seven cancer hospitals are being set up across the country. Of the seven, two —in Varanasi and Guwahati — are already operational. We are also making use of spin-off technologies for tuberculosis and oral cancer detection,” Shrikrishna Gupta said. Around 46 varieties of seeds have also been developed and distributed among farmers, he said.

MUMBAI: A day after the headless body of a woman was found near the Naval Gate in Vidhyavihar, the Mumbai police crime branch on Tuesday recovered her legs from a public waste bin around 100 metres away.

In an eerie reminder to the recent murder of Vakola musician Bennet Rebello, the investigators found the chopped limbs packed in a blue colour plastic cover. Sources said the pair of legs below knee almost matched with the headless body. The legs have been sent to Sion hospital for tests to verify if they match with the body found on Monday. The torso, wrapped in a bedsheet, was spotted by passersby, who alerted police.

“We hope to soon find the head, which will help us identify the deceased. Once the deceased is identified then it would not be difficult for us to crack the case,” said a crime branch officer.

While Ghatkopar police have registered a case of murder and destruction of evidence against unknown killers, the crime branch unit 7 is conducting a parallel probe.

It appears the woman was killed at another place and the body was then brought to Vidyavihar. Ghatkopar police said they are scanning CCTV cameras to try to find who dumped the body there.

Police are also awaiting the postmortem report to know the cause of deathwhether she was poisoned or stabbed to death. “There are injuries all over her body as if she had struggle with the killers. The left middle finger is broken badly. The doctors have said she should be around 40 years. As the stomach was swollen, it was initially suspected that she could be pregnant, but doctors at Sion Hospital have ruled it out. We are taking the help of social media and are circulating the images in the nearby slum pockets as the woman appears to be from lower middle class,” the officer added.

Amarnath, Anakapalli MLA, said the Jana Sena leader has come into politics to earn more money than in movies.

Speaking to media , Amar alleged that Kalyan has been opposing setting up of the executive capital in Vizag because the people defeated him in Gajuwaka. With that grudge, he has been opposing the proposal, said the MLA. He termed Amaravati as TDP Private Limited Capital, but Vizag as Public Limited Capital. He said Kalyan was losing his respect by making unnecessary comments over the capital city. He asked why Kalyan has not raised any question when Chandrababu Naidu mooted proposals of capitals at Nuziveedu and Guntur.

He alleged that Naidu has been provoking Amaravati farmers unnecessarily. He should make his stand clear whether he is the leader for the entire AP or a region, Amarnath said.

As a pilot model, this tri-partnership project started functioning since a month, reaching out to 300 villages covering around 15,000 households in neglected areas of the district. The ‘bridging the last milestone’ project — taken up by ITDA, Azim Premji philanthropic initiative and Nature NGO — will focus on welfare and empowerment of tribal and rural community.

“Through this initiative, we are raising awareness among tribals residing in remote hilly areas and enabling them to access various government schemes, social security measures, rights and entitlements including the MGNREGS, Recognition of Forest Rights Act, Rhythu Bharosa, Amma Vadi, public distribution system (PDS), PM Matritva Vandana Yojna etc,” S Balaraju, founder-director of Nature, said.

“Since these areas do not have mobile networks, we are facilitating community mobilisation and business correspondence through banks. Grama sabhas are being strengthened and support extended to village secretaries or grama sachivalayas in the tribal areas,” Balaraju said.

He added, “The facilitation of linkages will enable the tribals to access central and state flagship entitlements including the Navaratnalu. A public sector bank will also help villagers living in no-network areas to avail government schemes through online seeding of demographic details, Aadhaar correction and other technical support.”

The face value of total seized notes stood at Rs 1,00,63,000 as against Rs 64,46,000 in 2018 and Rs 17,26,000 in 2017.The corresponding arrests have been phenomenal too. As many as 41 FICN racketeers were arrested in 2019. “This is almost double the number of people arrested in 2018 (22) and eight times that of 2017 (5 arrests),” said Subhankar Sinha Sarkar, joint CP (headquarters), who was earlier in charge of STF.But, there is one striking feature this year. Amongst the 41arrested this year, 13 are from outside Bengal. This is the highest number of people arrested from outside the state this decade. These include not only men from states like Bihar and Jharkhand, but also from FICN dens located in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The other states where FICN from Bengal made their way into were Maharashtra and Haryana.“Three years after demonetization, the city police have made so many FICN arrests, which indicates that the old networks working from across the border are rearing their heads again,” said a top STF official. “We have found watermarks of a neighbouring country on these notes. Besides the 2,000 notes, features of which have been heavily compromised, this year we found even fakes of Rs 500 notes in abundance,” said an STF officer.The STF is also worried of FICN dealers dealing in illegal firearms in a direct tradeoff. The cops believe that certain criminals from both sides of the border between Bengal and Bangladesh are contacting Munger-based workers to assemble parts of weapons made in the two Parganas and paying them with fake currency printed in Bangladesh.“This is a win-win situation for both. While the FICN dealers could escape the glare of security forces at the border, those operating here could release the FICN received in smaller lots. This minimizes their chances of getting caught,” said an STF official.The features replicated were the transparent area, watermark, Ashoka Pillar emblem, the letters “Rs 2000” on the left, the guarantee clause with the RBI governor’s signature and the denomination number in Devanagari on the front. The trend was noticed since 2018, said STF sources.Sources in Lalbazar claimed that the notes — all of them Rs 2000 ones — carry the security thread. “The security thread is still not that fine. But these are definitely much better than what was coming to the city since December 2017. Most of the earlier catches were mere photocopies. These are actual prints,” said a senior investigating officer. “However, it is up to experts to tell us the extent to which the various security features have been compromised,” said an investigating official.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73052855,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110726,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-fake-note-seizures-peaked-in-2019/articleshow/73052859.cms

438,['1/01/2020'],West Bengal governor removes New Year’s Eve tweet after ‘Partition’ backlash,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Jagdeep Dhankhar (Photo: ANI)

KOLKATA: The West Bengal governor’s tweet on New Year’s Eve drew sharp responses from writers and politicians, prompting Jagdeep Dhankhar to remove it along with a photograph from his Twitter handle.

On Tuesday, the governor, while recording his New Year message to the people, uploaded his photograph sitting at a table captioned: “Recording of New Year Message for the people of State of West Bengal in the historical Raj Bhawan Library while sitting on the iconic table from which Lord Curzon signed first Partition of Bengal in 1905.”

The tweet hurt the sentiments of noted Bengali citizens, reviving the pangs of the “first Partition” order against which Rabindranath Tagore had written the song ‘Banglar mati, Banglar jol’. Tagore didn’t stop at that . He proposed celebrating Rakhi-bandhan against the partition on September 27, 1905 in a meeting convened at Sabitri Library Swadharma Samiti on Akrur Dutta Lane.

Dhankhar’s tweet assumed political significance in the light of the amended citizenship law when the opposition and particularly, chief minister Mamata Banerjee has often been reciting Tagore’s songs against the perceived attempt to divide people in Bengal along religious lines.

Author Sirshendu Mukhopadhyay didn’t like the governor using the “iconic” adjective in his tweet. “I think he (Dhankhar) misunderstood the entire thing. The word ‘iconic’ should not have been used. The governor has wrongly used the word,” Mukhopadhyay said.

Writer Prafulla Roy, who suffered the Partition ordeal, said: “Partition was painful. The word wasn’t used in the right context.”

Senior Trinamool leader Subrata Mukherjee, also the Bengal panchayat minister, said the governor’s tweet was “unfortunate”. “We want to forget the episode of Partition of Bengal. The tweet is unfortunate,” he said.

Twitterati erupted in protest. One of them, Rama S, made a tacit reference to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in his tweet, saying: “Are you collecting General Dyer memorabilia as well?”

Another, Diptansu Chaudhury, tweeted: “Are you celebrating the Partition of Bengal, Mr Governor? Or are you the architect of one more? Only province to have faced Partition thrice and He, the governor is proudly celebrating our agony, our deep pain. Great!!!”

Dhankhar tried to defend himself in vain as tweets came pouring on the governor’s Twitter handle. “The person sitting on this table is humble servant of the people mandated to uphold and protect the Constitution and serve the people of West Bengal. How can we be missing the wood for the trees?” he tweeted.

After some time, the governor realised it was not worth pursuing this debate and removed the tweet along and the photograph. “Responding to the reaction of friends and well-wishers and the respect I have for Bengali pride I have deleted the tweet. I get pride in Rabindranath and the spirit of unity. As governor I appreciate the sensitivity of the people and am sure all will appreciate my bona fide response,” Dhankhar tweeted.

439,['1/01/2020'],"PMK seeks dual citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamils, caste-based census","This story is from January 1, 2020

S Ramadoss

CHENNAI: A special general council meeting of the PMK, held in Tindivanam on Tuesday, has urged the Centre to ensure ‘dual citizenship’ for Sri Lankan Tamils by entering into a bilateral agreement. It also sought caste-wise census to determine higher percentage of reservations for the weaker sections. “The Sri Lankan Tamils are keen to retain their citizenship in the Island nation. To enable them lead an honourable life here, until they feel safe to return to their country, the Centre has to ensure dual citizenship for them,” a resolution passed at the PMK meeting said.

Another resolution passed at the meeting, urged the need for undertaking a caste-wise census in Tamil Nadu to increase the reservation limits, in the wake of 10% reservation brought by the Centre for the economically weaker section. Yet another resolution sought the implementation of 27% reservation for OBCs in higher medical education, even while demanding reserving up to 80% of the jobs in private sector for locals.

The PMK meeting passed 18 resolutions in all. These include urging the Centre to abandon the hydro-carbon projects planned in the Cauvery delta districts, linking of Godavari and Cauvery rivers and undertaking a massive irrigation project at a cost of Rs 1 lakh crore, to be funded by the Centre and state - to double the acreage under irrigation in the state. The party also sought the release of the seven convicts undergoing imprisonment in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. If not, at least offer them long-term parole, a resolution said. PMK also sought statehood for Puducherry.

PMK also urged the Centre to do away with collections at toll plazas on highways. “There are 45 toll plazas that are collecting tolls from road users. The agencies operating several of these toll plazas have collected more than the cost of those road projects. Once this happens, the norm is to collect just 40% of the toll amount to maintain the roads,” it said

441,['1/01/2020'],"After Ayodhya &amp; Rafale verdicts in 2019, SC to decide on CAA &amp; J&amp;K this year","This story is from January 1, 2020

Supreme Court of India (file photo)

NEW DELHI: At a time when dissent gets traction among intellectuals and social media, the Supreme Court in 2019 achieved the unexpected by rendering a unanimous verdict on the 70-year-old Ayodhya land dispute and putting stamp of approval on the deal to purchase 36 fully-loaded Rafale jets from France.

In achieving unanimity in the contentious Ayodhya land dispute, which was argued belligerently for 40 days, the credit must go to each of the five judges, who hailed from different backgrounds and regions, and to the leadership of then CJI Ranjan Gogoi as those in forefront of the legal battle had predicted a split verdict. The decision was unique as it did not have the name of the author, a gesture by the leader of the bench to acknowledge the contribution of each judge - Justices S A Bobde (now CJI), D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer.

Controversy over purchase of Rafale jets from France, involvement of Anil Ambani ’s firm as Indian offshore partner of French manufacturer Dassault, coupled with incessant reports on select documents by a section of the media forced the SC to revisit its December 2018 verdict giving a clean chit to the NDA government. Petitioners - Prashant Bhushan, Arun Shourie and Yashwant Sinha - tried their best to fly Rafale into Bofors infamy. After a detailed examination, the court came up with the same finding - nothing wrong with the deal. Only one to face awkward situation was former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, who apologised to SC for having misquoted the court order in public. He was advised to be careful in future.

The SC also revisited its decision quashing the custom that barred entry of women in 10-50 years’ age group into Sabarimala Ayyappa temple in Kerala. If the earlier decision was 4-1, the five-judge bench by 3-2 majority decided to send the contentious issue to a seven-judge bench. The majority judgement said the 7-judge bench must chart out a guideline for the court to decide in future on issues where fundamental rights clashed with faith and custom. The larger bench in the new year could also look into discriminatory practices in other religions - entry of women into mosques, entry of Parsi women who are married outside the community into Agiyari and the practice of female genital mutilation in Bohra Muslim community.

Though it gave judgements on three contentious issues - Ayodhya, Rafale and Sabarimala, the SC would get no respite in 2020, with the first task in hand being adjudication on the constitutional validity of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which saw nation-wide protests.

Another Constitution bench headed by Justice N V Ramana will also decide on the constitutional validity of the Centre’s decision to end the 70-year-long special status conferred on Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution and divide the state into two Union Territories. Justice Ramana-headed bench will also deliver judgement on validity of restrictions imposed on use of mobile phones and internet after the August 5 decision.

The SC also redeemed people’s faith in it by upholding disqualification of 15 Congress-JD(S) MLAs in Karnataka, who played a key role in toppling the coalition government led by H D Kumaraswamy. However, the bench headed by Justice Ramana expressed anguish over Speakers increasingly forgetting their impartial role and dancing to the tune of the party in office.

If prolonged mobile phone shutdown post-August 5 caused hardship to residents of the Kashmir valley, the SC decision allowing government to recover Rs 92,000 crore from telecom service providers pushed the operators to a corner and the sector into a tailspin. It also judicially examined the CBI vs CBI fight erupting from personal differences between then director Alok Verma and the special director Rakesh Asthana and the powers of the Centre to divest the CBI chief of his powers and send the two top agency officials on leave. Though SC reinstated Verma, he was quickly replaced by a PM-led high-level panel.

After lulling the shadow boxing between Verma and Asthana, the SC penalised the West Bengal police for seeing a ghost in the movie ‘Bhobhisyoter Bhoot’ and unofficially pressuring theatre owners not to screen the film. It also granted bail to P Chidamabram, refusing to go by the contents of the sealed cover docket provided by ED about corruption by the former finance minister in the INX media foreign investment case.

BENGALURU: Traffic on Yeshwantpur flyover was disrupted after a sports utility vehicle (SUV), which is part of chief minister BS Yediyurappa's convoy , jumped the median and rammed an autorickshaw and a mini-truck coming in the opposite direction on Tuesday morning.

The SUV belonged to the chief minister's secretary Selvakumar. The officer, however, was not in his vehicle and was in Yediyurappa's car when the accident happened around 11am. Police said the CM's convoy was heading to Tumakuru and Selvakumar's SUV was in the rear of the convoy.

""Vinay Kumar, the driver of the SUV, lost control of the vehicle on entering the flyover and jumped the median. The car hit an autorickshaw and a mini-truck before coming to a halt,"" traffic police said.

Vinay Kumar and two others in the SUV sustained bruises. The auto driver was shifted to a private hospital with injuries on his hands and legs. The truck driver and his assistant escaped unhurt.

Traffic was disrupted for more than an hour as the accident caused a snarl up to Malleswaram 18th Cross on one side and Goreguntepalya junction on the other side.

File photo

NEW DELHI: It was a hyperactive year for Enforcement Directorate in 2019 when the agency had in its custody some of the most high profile persons like former finance minister P Chidambaram , former Karnataka minister D K Shivakumar, Fortis Healthcare promoter Malvinder Singh and Religare CMD Sunil Godhwani in various cases. It also succeeded in getting three fugitives deported from Dubai -- British national Christian Michel and Dubai resident Rajiv Saxena, wanted in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper payoffs deal, and corporate lobbyist Deepak Talwar, in the Air India money laundering case.

The agency also interrogated Bhushan Steel CMD Sanjay Singhal and Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath’s nephew Ratul Puri. The agency’s ongoing money laundering cases against Robert Vadra , son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi , also moved forward. The agency has approached courts seeking cancellation of his anticipatory bail, seeking custodial interrogation. The ED has accused Vadra of links to fugitive defence dealer Sanjay Bhandari and claimed the latter, along with Rajiv Saxena, received payoffs in three defence deals — Embraer, Pilatus and AgustaWetland.

In the Swiss Pilatus aircraft deal, ED alleged that kickbacks of 39,527,070 Swiss Franc (around Rs 254 crore) was transferred to Sanjay Bhandari in his Dubai accounts. The 75 aircraft Pilatus deal was signed by UPA government in 2009-10. After the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal, this was the second big defence contract under ED investigation.

The agency has in its investigation reports accused certain Dubai-based shell companies of having received money from Bhandari which was further used to acquire properties in London allegedly by Vadra and his front entities.

But the agency hogged headlines when it arrested Chidambaram in the INX-Media money laundering case in October, after he had already spent 55 days in CBI and judicial custody in the same case. The senior Congress leader got relief from courts after 106 days in custody. The agencies claimed that shell companies associated with his son Karti received kickbacks from INX-Media and Aircel-Maxis besides others in lieu of favours granted by Chidambaram when he was the FM.

Just before Chidambaram’s arrest, ED had in September acted against D K Shivakumar, former Karnataka minister and senior Congress leader, at the forefront of action to protect party MLAs from Gujarat from being poached by BJP. This was when senior party leader Ahmed Patel was contesting a crucial Rajya Sabha poll. The ED investigation in a case involving Sterling Biotech and alleged money laundering to the tune of Rs 10,000 crore was another important case.

Corporate lobbyist Deepak Talwar, deported from Dubai, and still in custody for almost an year, is considered an important catch for the agency which, along with the CBI, has been probing the involvement of former civil aviation minister Praful Patel and some top bureaucrats during the previous UPA regime for alleged kickbacks and money laundering.

The ED’s investigation over the last two years has revealed that Talwar had received alleged kickbacks of over Rs 370 crore disguised as consultancy fees and donation to his NGO from foreign airlines for illegally benefitting them by using his contacts with the then civil aviation minister and senior bureaucrats withdrawing Air India’s services from profitable routes.

BENGALURU: A 32-year-old software engineer who was trying to land a job in the US was cheated of Rs 4.5 lakh by a job portal. Kshama Senani (name changed) of Nanjappa Layout in Arakere, told Hulimavu police she uploaded her resume on job portal careerindiadice.com on November 24.

""Minutes later, a person identifying himself as Harsh Mishra from careerindiadice.com called me and promised me a job in the US. He told me to deposit Rs 8,106 for registration. The same day, another man, who identified himself as Shivanshu, called me and said I had to pay Rs 3.1 lakh for background verification and profile creation. He promised that I was free to seek withdrawal of services and would get a full refund. I paid them using my HDFC credit card,"" the complaint reads.

The same evening, Kshama decided not to pursue job opportunities in the US due to personal reasons and called up careerindiadice.com and sought a refund.

""The job portal claimed I needed to pay Rs 1.3 lakh to 'swap' my profile and I paid the same on December 10 with my HDFC debit card. When I checked, I found the money had been transferred to Relfeckt Incorporation and Premium Services. I was told it would be refunded between December 22 and 25. I called up Shivanshu again to check and he claimed the process was almost over and the money would be deposited on December 26. He also sent an email confirming this,"" Kshama said in her complaint on Sunday.

""When the money was not refunded on December 26, I called Shivanshu and others and none of them answered,"" she added. ""I also went to the address provided on the portal but no office existed at the place. I realised the information published was false,"" the complaint said. When TOI called the number mentioned on the website on Tuesday, it was temporarily disabled. Police are yet to initiate a probe in this regard.

476,['1/01/2020'],Kerala passes resolution seeking CAA withdrawal,"This story is from January 1, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a rare show of unity, the Kerala assembly on Tuesday passed a resolution demanding that the Centre withdraw the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 immediately, making the state the first to oppose the controversial law legislatively. Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan said by passing the resolution, the assembly has ‘raised its status’ and Kerala has led by example, though it is moot that the resolution will have any impact beyond its symbolism.

All members of the serving LDF and the opposition UDF supported the resolution moved by CM Pinarayi Vijayan in the special session, saying the amended law was damaging to the basic values of India’s Constitution and secularism. O Rajagopal, the lone BJP MLA in the 140-member House, opposed the resolution, terming it “illegal and unconstitutional”.

Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad , who is in Kerala as part of a campaign to clarify on CAA , dismissed the resolution, saying that the state should have sought proper legal advice before venturing beyond its brief. “It is only Parliament which has got the power to make law in this regard and no other assembly, including Kerala assembly (has the power),” he said.

The resolution said CAA is in violation of the Right to Equality stated in Part III of the Constitution. “Considering rising concerns among majority of people about possible discrimination based on religion under the CAA, which would also destroy the concept of secularism envisaged by the Indian Constitution, the Kerala legislative assembly requests the central government to initiate measures to cancel the Act,” it said. Though UDF suggested an amendment to the resolution asking the Centre to stop all procedures for implementing the CAA until further decision, Vijayan said the Union government could withdraw it immediately through an ordinance and any request for interim measures would weaken the resolution.

Presenting the resolution, he said the CAA has led to nationwide protests besides destroying the global image of the country.

Citizens enjoy a cuppa on a chilly Tuesday morning

KOLKATA: Expect warmer nights as the minimum temperature is expected to rise from Wednesday. For the past few days, the minimum temperature has been below 12°C. On Tuesday, it was 11.6°C, two notches below the normal mark. By Wednesday this could jump up 12°C mark or a little over it.

Met office, however, sounded good news for people heading to Darjeeling stating they might get snowfall on January 3 and January 4.

“Due to two weather systems, a western disturbance and a deep trough, there is a fair chance of snowfall in Darjeeling,” said GK Das, director (weather) at Regional Meteorological Centre Kolkata.

In Kolkata the minimum temperature is expected to shoot up to around 14°C by Thursday and further more the next day. But due to a cloud cover the maximum temperature could be pushed down as low as 20°C on the Jan 3. With the maximum temperature at 22.5°C on Tuesday, the mercury was three notches below the normal mark.

“The difference between the maximum and minimum temperature will be very narrow during this phase. Even though the chill could go missing, the cold feeling will persist,” added Das.

As predicted by the Met office, Kolkata is expected to lash by light to moderate rain on Friday and Saturday. An interaction between a western disturbance and lower level easterlies have already started causing moisture incursion into the land. Even though the early part of Friday could be dry, rains could strike any time towards the evening.

“The mercury will start slipping again after this phase. But how much it goes down will depend on the intensity of the rain and other weather systems prevailing around that time,” said Das.

HYDERABAD: After a delayed winter, January is expected to begin on a cold note. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad, predicted a gradual drop in minimum temperature after January 3.If the IMD figures are anything to go by then 2019 was perhaps the warmest New Year’s eve that the city has experienced in the last decade. The last year ended on a cold note as Hyderabad witnessed its coldest day of the season on December 31, 2018, registering a minimum temperature of 9.5 degree Celsius and maximum temperature of 27 degree Celsius. However, this year, the minimum temperature was double than what it was last year—at 18 degree Celsius and the maximum temperature stood at 27.5 degree Celsius— indicating a delay in setting of winter.Meteorologists claim that the north-easterly winds, which should have ideally hit Telangana by the first week of December, was delayed due to winds from Bay of Bengal.“This year, it has been relatively cloudy due to blowing of south-westerly winds, which have higher moisture levels instead of northerly winds,” said Raja Rao, meteorologist at IMD, Hyderabad. “Cloud formation restricts morning heat that is absorbed by the earth. Due to the clouds, heat is reflecting back to the earth resulting in rise in night-time temperature,” he added.While meteorologists predict that rains are likely to continue till January 3, there will be a drop in mercury level after that as clouds fade away. “From January 4, weather activities will start to clear up and minimums will once again fall in Telangana,” read a report issued by Skymet, an independent weather forecasting agency.According to IMD, the mercury levels are expected to drop two to three degree Celsius below normal by January 7.

AHMEDABAD: Around 8,000-10,000 cameras will be used to carry out the 2020 lion census in Gujarat , the last abode of the Asiatic lion . As against 15,000sqkm area surveyed in the last census, lions will be counted across 25,000sqkm area spanning seven districts.

For the first time, the expertise of Wildlife Institute of India (WII) will be perused in the census, scheduled to take place in May 2020. “The WII has sent a proposal to the Gujarat government and two rounds of meetings have been held for finalizing the modalities of the census,” WII scientist and lion expert YV Jhala said.

The 2015 lion census had counted 523 lions in the state. The number is expected to have risen phenomenally with internal assessments of the forest department indicating that the population may have crossed the 1,000-mark.

Sources said the government will adopt the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)’s technology for the lion census. “Forest department is in process of finalizing details for lion census. We are considering emulating tiger census methodology,” Shyamal Tikadar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) said.

As per this model, the census area will be divided into a three-km grid each. Field officers will first carry out human surveillance to recover hair, teeth, nails etc. of the animals in a scientific method as laid out by NTCA. Physical forms will also be filled out noting the description of the lions. Around 1,500-2,000 field personnel will be employed for the exercise.

“In the second phase, 8,000-10,000 cameras would be installed to capture the movement of lions,” said a senior official.

481,['1/01/2020'],Man arrested for attacking film-maker in Salt Lake,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Representative image

KOLKATA: A young photographer and film-maker from Salt Lake was allegedly assaulted by an acquaintance, who brandished a knife, following a difference in opinion over Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). The trigger was apprently something that the photographer had posted on his social media page.

The accused, Avijit Dasgupta (51), was arrested within 21 hours of a complaint being lodged. He will be produced in a Salt Lake court on Wednesday.

The incident took place at EA Block in Salt Lake, opposite Bidhannagar College on Monday night, when the filmmaker, Ronny Sen, along with a group of friends, allegedly went to confront Dasgupta outside his home.

Sen alleged that a scuffle started and Dasgupta made to attack him with a knife even before he could start a conversation. Sen, however, stepped back and escaped being stabbed. Later, he lodged a complaint at the Bidhannagar North police station.

Cops have accepted the complaint and said they had started a probe. “There were some discrepancies in the initial complaint but later, we changed the complaint and arrested the accused from his house,” said a senior officer at the Bidhannagar Commissionerate.

Sen, a resident of HA Block in Salt Lake, said Dasgupta had abused and threatened him several times earlier over his views on NRC, CAA and nationalism that he posted on the social media. That, sparked a difference between him and Dasgupta, whom he had known for years, Sen said.

“We had become so different in our views that I had blocked him on my social media profile a year ago. Still for the past few days, be began abusing me on WhatsApp and calls. On Monday, I decided to confront him and asked him to meet me. He first called me at Ultadanga but later, asked me to come near his home. When I went there, he attacked me,” said Sen.

On being asked, Dasgupta admitted before TOI that he had been carrying the knife but for “self defence”.

“When I saw five men approaching my house, I was scared and carried a kitchen knife for my own protection. But I didn’t attack him. I know Ronny for several years and I didn’t like his comments on social media. But I offer an unconditional apology for the things I said to him. I did not have any intention to hurt him,” said Dasgupta.

After the incident, Sen made a Facebook post on the incident, alleging he was attacked by a “right-wing lumpen” and that the attack was unprovoked. He even mentioned in his post that he was attacked because of his views and opinions against NRC, CAA and NPR. After he made the post, it was shared several times by hundreds of Facebook users.

482,['1/01/2020'],Hospitalisation is 6 times more expensive in private sector: Study,"This story is from January 1, 2020

Representative image

BENGALURU: Hospitalisation for any ailment in a private hospital costs six times more than the expense incurred in a government institution, a study by the Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation has revealed.

The report, ‘Key indicators of social consumption in India: Health’ compared the average expenditure incurred per person for a hospital stay in government and private institutions. It put the cost at Rs 4,452 in a government hospital and Rs 31,845 at a private facility.

The pan-India study looked into nine categories of ailments and found the cost went up eight times in case of musculoskeletal and cardiovascular conditions. It covered 1,13,823 households and the data were collected between July 2017 and June 2018.

With the study not specifying the duration of hospitalisation and type of treatment and stopping short of going into state-wise specifics, TOI did a random check of comparative costs of treatment in private and government hospitals in Bengaluru. It was found that hospitalisation in private establishments was 2-20 times costlier than in government institutions. For example, a one-day stay in ICU in a government hospital costs Rs 1,500, while private hospitals raise a Rs 30,000 bill for the same.

An uncomplicated open heart surgery in a private hospital costs Rs 2.8 lakh and around Rs 95,000 in a public hospital like Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Science and Research. The cost of a knee replacement in a government hospital is Rs 65,000 and four times more in a private facility.

“Treatment in a government setup is highly subsidised. A procedure like mastectomy (surgical removal of breast) costs Rs 4,500 in Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology for a general ward patient. It’s Rs 25,000 if the patient prefers a single room accommodation,” said Dr C Ramachandra, director. In a Bengaluru private hospital, the same surgery costs no less than Rs 3.2 lakh.

Hospitalisation for cancer treatment is the most expensive in private hospitals compared to any other category of ailments. It costs Rs 93,305 in private hospitals as against Rs 61,216 in trust/NGO/charitable hospitals and Rs 22,520 in public hospitals.

The medicines, package component, diagnostic tests, doctor’s fee and bed charges make up for most of the cost at private hospitals. The package component introduced by private hospitals in urban areas is more than that in rural areas.

Experts said the need of the hour is to strengthen government hospitals and increase dependability on public health services.

However, Dr Alexander Thomas, president, Association of Healthcare providers India (AHPI), said compared to the global scenario, treatment cost in India’s private hospitals is not steep but realistic. Ideally, treatment in public hospitals must be free. “In private hospitals, income over expense is just about 15-20% and it does not come from the lab and pharmacy,” he said, adding that technology and resources are major differentiators in the private healthcare sector.

According to Dr Devi Shetty, renowned cardiac surgeon and member of the vision health group, Government of Karnataka , major reasons for the present situation can be traced to mistakes the government committed 3-4 decades ago.

“The worst thing that the government did was that it surrendered public health and medical education to the private sector. There’s a lack of skilled manpower and huge vacancies of specialists in government hospitals, making citizens opt for private hospitals. Ideally, 60-70% of the population which is not in position to afford treatment in private hospitals should be taken care of by government hospitals, but that’s not happening,” said Dr Shetty.

484,['1/01/2020'],Bengaluru: Underpass flooded by lake breach still unmotorable,"This story is from January 1, 2020

The underpass is littered with mud and dotted with potholes.

BENGALURU: Nearly two months after Hosakerehalli Lake in southwest Bengaluru breached, an adjacent underpass that was flooded remains in a deplorable condition.

Spread over nearly 53 acres, the lake in Banashankari Stage III breached on November 10, inundating over five houses in its vicinity.

The 50-metre underpass had been closed to enable speedy execution of work to seal the lake breach. Nearly two months later, it resembles a dust bowl and is littered with clumps of mud and pockmarked with potholes. Lack of streelights only adds to residents’ worries at night. The stretch is a crucial link for people commuting between Hosakerehalli and Rajarajeshwari Nagar.

“When the lake breached, officials visited the spot and promised to fix the underpass. But no one has bothered to do so,” said S Sadashivaiah, who lives near the lake. “We are unable to keep our doors/windows open because of the dust kicked up by vehicles. We feel suffocated even within the confines of our homes,” he lamented.

Hosakerehalli Resident Welfare Association has raised several complaints but to no avail. “We have decided to hold a protest and block roads until BBMP fixes the underpass,” said a member of HRWA. “Even water cans are getting dusty and are impossible to use,” said Ravindra K, a resident.

Another resident, Shymala (name changed), blamed the civic agency for the mess. “When the lake breached, officials got JCBs to stop the water flow, but they ended up damaging the road by throwing debris on the sides,” she said.

A senior BBMP official said marshals and officials have been informed about the road condition but the problem hasn’t been resolved due to lack of funds. “At present, we don’t have funds to take up any development work. We will soon call for a tender to fix underpasses across the city,” said the official.

KARWAR: In an embarrassment to the defence forces, police arrested two navy personnel from Karwar base and rescued a woman after raiding a brothel in the outskirts of the city late Monday night.

The arrested personnel are sailors from INS Kadamba Naval base.

Police rescued a woman from West Bengal and arrested Prabhavati Naik, who allegedly runs the brothel. Her husband Pandurang Naik, 69, took to his heels seeing the police team.

Wracked by controversies like honeytrap incidents, the defence ministry had on Monday issued a circular, banning smartphones on warships, dockyard and other sensitive defence installations.

The defence ministry's note comes close on the heels of Andhra Pradesh police arresting three persons from INS Kadamba base on December 20 on charges of espionage. The arrested sailors had allegedly been honey-trapped by Pakistani intelligence agencies and had transferred sensitive information to Pakistan agencies.

According to police, Pandurang Naik and his wife had been arrested in the past for similar offences. The arrested persons have been produced in a court here and remanded in judicial custody till January 12.

NEW DELHI: Taking a dim view of the Congress’ criticism of the appointment of Gen Bipin Rawat as the country’s first Chief of Defence Staff ( CDS ), former Union minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said it was “ill-informed” and intended to create a divide between institutions critical to national security.

“Being an erudite lawyer and MP I thought @ManishTewari would argue on facts and logic but alas, that is not to be. I hope he had at least seen the press release before tweeting on an important issue like the institution of the CDS,” Singh tweeted referring to Congress MP Manish Tewari questioning Gen Rawat’s appointment.

“The roles of respective Chiefs, Defence Secretary and CDS are well defined... Please do not trivialise the issue or try to divide,” he said. He took dig at Tiwari saying if the “tweets of @ManishTewari are a CV for better role in Congress, they are excellent”. “But, if it is to add to discourse on national security, they are misleading and harmful,” Rathore said.

Tiwari had tweeted, “Why is appointment of a CDS is fraught with difficulties and ambiguities? What implications does nomenclature Principal Military Advisor to Defence Minister have in relation to the three service chief’s in terms of Military advice tendered to the government?” He added, “Will the CDS as Permanent Chairperson of Joint Chi- ef’s of Staff Committee outrank the three service Chief’s?...”

492,['1/01/2020'],"Greater Noida: Man pulled into car, robbed at Pari Chowk","This story is from January 1, 2020

Hemant Bhardwaj

GREATER NOIDA: A 35-year-old bank manager was allegedly robbed of his belongings at gunpoint by four armed men inside a moving car near Pari Chowk on Monday. The crime took place at 8.50 am when Hemant Bhardwaj from Khurja in Bulandshahr was on his way to his office. He works as a deputy manager in a Delhi-based bank.

“I got down from a bus for an interchange at Pari Chowk. I was walking on the service lane of the expressway when a man pushed me inside a Hyundai Verna car that had no number plate. There were three more men sitting inside the vehicle. The miscreants took me at gunpoint and asked me to part with my belongings,” the victim said.

Bharadwaj added that the accused pointed a pistol at him and asked him to surrender everything he had. “The man on the front seat snatched my bag and two others kept checking my pockets. They kept the gun pointed at me all along. They took all the cash that I had, along with a gold chain and a ring. They also took the battery of my mobile phone,” he said.

After about 15 minutes, the accused allegedly threw Bharadwaj out of the car. He then informed the police and an FIR was registered against the four men under sections 342 (wrongful confinement) and 392 (robbery) of the IPC.

The station house officer of Beta 2 police station, Sujeet Upadhyay, said they were checking CCTV footage. “CCTV clips are being checked to identify the criminals. The arrests will be made soon.”

493,['1/01/2020'],"Ban PFI for violence during anti-CAA stir, UP police tell govt","This story is from January 1, 2020

File photo

NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh police has written to the state home department seeking a ban on Popular Front of India (PFI), a “radical” Islamic outfit with notable pockets of influence in western UP and which is accused of being behind incidents of violence and vandalism during recent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

According to a senior police functionary, the UP police has, in its communication to the home department, pointed to PFI’s strong presence in select towns and districts of western UP — particularly Shamli, Meerut and Deoband — and its alleged role in fanning violent anti-CAA protests. Its purported UP chief Wasim and other activists have been arrested by the UP police in this regard.

In Shamli district alone, 28 people, including 14 members of PFI, were arrested for allegedly attempting to incite violence in the name of anti-CAA stir. Around 150 people were also taken into preventive custody recently, based on intelligence inputs received by UP Police about PFI “planning unrest” in Kairana and Kandhla towns of Shamli.

“We have submitted the various case files relating to PFI activities in UP to back our request for a ban on the outfit under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act,” a senior UP police official told TOI.

PFI on Tuesday, however, denied the state police’s allegations linking it to violent anti-CAA protests and alleged that the proposed ban is an effort to suppress “one of the largest popular agitations since Independence against the anti-Constitutional CAA.” Pointing out that only BJP-ruled states were suppressing protests, PFI accused the Yogi Adityanath government of bloodbath and destruction.

Condemning the move to ban it, PFI in a statement said: “It is nothing but a face-saving act. The move against PFI is yet another authoritarian step by the UP police against democratic activism.”

Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya too told newsmen that PFI was allegedly behind large-scale damage to public property and anarchy during anti-CAA protests. “Such organisations will not be allowed to flourish. PFI is an incarnation of the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI),” he said.

Additional director-general of police (Kanpur Zone) Prem Prakash had emphasised on an alleged Kerala plot in Babupurwa and Yateemkhana violence. On Tuesday, he told TOI, “Some PFI members have been detained for interrogation and incriminatory and anti-national literature was seized from their possession in Kanpur.”

A senior police official in the intelligence wing of police said all local intelligence units across districts have been asked to share information on recovery of material from PFI members.

The alleged Kerala link in the violence during anti-CAA protests across the state was first shared by UP deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma with arrests of PFI members on December 25.

An NIA dossier submitted to the Centre in 2017 — making a case for banning PFI under UAPA — had termed as “radical” the outfit’s policy of recruiting only committed Muslim youth “who assiduously follow Islamic tenets”.

NIA said PFI cadres are encouraged to act as guardians of “Islamic values” and cited four of terror cases involving the organisation cadres. These include chopping of a professor’s hand in Kerala’s Idukki district; holding of a training camp in Kannur from where NIA allegedly seized swords, country-made bombs and ingredients for making IEDs; murder of RSS leader Rudresh in Bengaluru on October 16, 2016 and the Islamic State Al-Hindi Module case in which IS-inspired youth from Kerala and Tamil Nadu were recruited to target prominent persons and places in south India.

NIA had claimed PFI pursues a strategy aimed at communalising Indian polity, enforcing Taliban brand of Islam, heightening existing social divisions and maintaining a trained bank of volunteers for physical actions. PFI, however, had strongly refuted the allegations made by the agency.

The dossier also pointed out that many of PFI’s founding leaders were associated with SIMI before it was banned in 2001. This includes former PFI chairman E M Abdurahiman, who was all-India general secretary of SIMI in 1980-81 and 1982-93, PFI national vice-chairman P Koya who was with SIMI in 1978-79 and SDPI president E Aboobacker who was Kerala state president of SIMI in 1982-84.

494,['1/01/2020'],"Noida bought more vehicles in 2019, but cheaper ones","This story is from January 1, 2020

The city is a green shoot in the slowdown smog that has shrouded the automobile industry in India.

NOIDA: The city is a green shoot in the slowdown smog that has shrouded the automobile industry in India. Despite the issues plaguing the sector, the number of vehicle registrations in the city continued to grow.

But the growth in percentage terms showed a downward trend in 2019. The number of luxury vehicles registered in Noida also reduced.

Even though the total tax collected from vehicle registrations by the transport department increased marginally, officials said the reduction in the number of new luxury vehicle registrations caused a tax loss of nearly Rs 15-20 crore last year. Registration of vehicles priced over Rs 50 lakh increased from 396 in 2017 to 431 in 2018 and then saw a decline to 399 again in 2019.

“Usually, the number of vehicles registered increases every consecutive year in Noida in all categories. However, last year saw the number of luxury vehicles dropping. Even in the four-wheeler category, there were more number of smaller vehicles registered than the bigger sedans and SUVs,” said A K Pandey, the ARTO.

He added that even if the number of vehicles registered is higher, the value of the vehicles is less. It reduced the tax collections and also showed people’s unwillingness to invest in costlier vehicles.

“If there are around 50 luxury vehicles less than the previous year, we have a revenue loss of Rs 15-20 crore. So, while there has been a 30% increase in revenue from 2017 to 2019, the rate of growth has reduced in 2019,” said Pandey.

The total number of vehicles registered in 2019 in the city was 89,625, which is marginally higher than 85,628 in 2018 and 66,582 in 2017.

The number of four-wheelers registered in Noida increased from 21,135 in 2017 to 23,761 in 2018 and grew further to 25,537 in 2019. Meanwhile, the number of two-wheelers increased from 39,811 in 2017 to 51,657 in 2018 and increased only marginally to 55,000 in 2019.

This means, the growth in the registration of two-wheelers was 29% in 2018, but came down to 6.5% in 2019. The officials say that the two-wheeler sales show the purchasing power of most of the middle-class population.

The number of commercial vehicles registered in Noida also increased from 4,966 in 2017 to 9,157 in 2018 but reduced to 7,999 last year. The tax revenue for commercial vehicles, however, continued to increase from Rs 13.4 crore in 2018 to Rs 13.6 crore in 2019.

The rebate will be on high-end buses of the UPSRTC, like Volvo and Scania.

“The new fare will come into effect from the first day of 2020. The rebate will be on the basis of telescopic fare structure, which means that the fare decreases proportionally with the increase in distance,” he said.

Fare will be decreased by 1.5% to 15% depending on the length of the journey.

According to the fare structure, for the first 100 km, the rates have remained unchanged, however, for up to 50 km, there will be a reduction of fare by 1.5% per kilometre.

“In absolute terms, the fare from Lucknow for a Delhi-bound passenger will come down from Rs 1, 260 to Rs 1, 071,” said Singh.

The official also said that after three months, the plan will be reviewed and it could be extended to other routes, like Bareilly, Varanasi and Gorakhpur .
