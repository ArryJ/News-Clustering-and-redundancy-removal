4,2020/02/14,Facebook to allow paid political messages that are not ads,"Policy change comes days after U.S. presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg exploited a loophole to run humorous messages promoting his campaign on the accounts of popular Instagram personalities.

Facebook decided on February 14 to allow a type of paid political message that had sidestepped many of the social network’s rules governing political ads.

Its policy change comes days after U.S. presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg exploited a loophole to run such humorous messages promoting his campaign on the accounts of popular Instagram personalities followed by millions of younger people.

Mr. Bloomberg’s use of the loophole and Facebook’s policy change in response underscore difficulties tech companies and regulators have in keeping up with the changing nature of paid political messages. It used to be clearer what’s an ad and what isn’t - and thus what’s subject to disclosures and other rules. With social media, a campaign can pay can pay celebrities and other influential users to spread a message on their behalf, without ever buying an ad and be subject to its rules.

“This is a new kind of activity that simply didn’t exist when the rules for internet political communications were last updated,” said Commissioner Ellen L. Weintraub of the Federal Election Commission.

Also Read Political ad spending rises, Facebook leads digital space

The change involves what Facebook calls “branded content” — sponsored items posted by ordinary users who are typically paid by companies or organisations. Advertisers pay the influential users directly to post about their brand.

Facebook makes no money from such posts and does not consider them advertising. As a result, branded content isn’t governed by Facebook’s advertising policies, which require candidates and campaigns to verify their identity with a U.S. ID or mailing address and disclose how much they spent running each ad.

Also read: Should online political advertising be regulated?

Until February 14, Facebook tried to deter campaigns from using such branded content by barring them from using a tool designed to help advertisers run such posts on Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. The February 14 rule change will now allow campaigns in the U.S. to use this tool, provided they’ve been authorised by Facebook to run political ads and disclose who paid for the sponsored posts.

The Bloomberg campaign took the unconventional step of paying social media influencers — individuals with huge followings — to post Bloomberg memes using their Instagram accounts. Different versions of the sponsored posts from the Bloomberg campaign ran on more than a dozen influential Instagram accounts, each of which have millions of followers.

Also Read Facebook won’t ban political advertisement

That effort skirted many of the rules that tech companies have imposed on political ads to safeguard U.S. elections from malicious foreign and domestic interference and misinformation. Online political ads have been controversial, especially after it was revealed Russia used them in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election. In response, Facebook has rolled out a number of rules to prevent a repeat of that, though it has declined to fact-check political ads and refuses to ban even blatantly false messages.

The Bloomberg campaign’s memes showed the 78-year-old candidate, in a tongue-in-cheek awkward fashion, chatting with popular social media influencers with names like “Tank Sinatra,” asking them to help him raise his profile among younger folk. “Can you post a meme that lets everyone know I’m the cool candidate?” Mr. Bloomberg wrote in one of the exchanges posted by an account called F*** Jerry, which has nearly 15 million followers on Instagram. The candidate then sent a photo of him wearing baggy chino shorts, an orange polo and a zip-up vest.

F*** Jerry’s account then replied, “Ooof that will cost like a billion dollars.” Bloomberg responded by asking where to send the money.

With the sponsored posts, Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign said it was reaching those who might not be normally interested in the day-to-day of politics. “You want to engage people at every platform and you want them to feel like they’re not just getting a canned generic statement,” campaign spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said of the campaign’s strategy.

The Bloomberg posts weren’t much more than self-deprecating humour used to sell a candidate’s old guy appeal, using a tactic that until now was largely used to sell skin care products or clothing-subscription services. But the lack of oversight and clear rules around influencer marketing, not to mention their effectiveness in reaching younger audiences, makes them ripe for misuse.

Also Read Facebook may have 275 million duplicate accounts globally

It’s not yet clear if Facebook’s sudden policy change will close all the loopholes, though the company says the issue represents a new territory and its approach could change over time. The same goes for regulation, too, which is even further behind than the tech companies.

The Bloomberg campaign declined to say how much it paid for the sponsored posts, or if it had more of them in the works. The posts did not appear in Facebook’s ad transparency library, which catalogs the political ads that campaigns buy directly from Facebook or Instagram, and tells users how much was spent on them. Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign told on February 13 that Instagram does not currently require the campaign to disclose that information on the sponsored posts it ran earlier this week.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/j70yvr/article30823445.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FACEBOOK-PAID-POLITICAL-MEMES,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-to-allow-paid-political-messages-that-are-not-ads/article30823446.ece
5,2020/02/14,Microsoft temporarily blocked from beginning Pentagon project,"AWS had earlier alleged that the contract was awarded to Microsoft last October after US President Donald Trump exercised his influence over the country’s Defence Department.

A federal judge in the U.S. has temporarily blocked Microsoft from beginning work on the $10 billion Pentagon Cloud computing project following a motion filed by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The contents of the court order passed on Thursday was not made public, CNBC reported.

Amazon had asked the judge to force a temporary stay of work on the Joint Enterprise Defence Infrastructure, or JEDI, project until the court can rule on Amazon’s protest over Pentagon awarding it to Microsoft.

AWS had earlier alleged that the contract was awarded to Microsoft last October after US President Donald Trump exercised his influence over the country’s Defence Department.

The Cloud computing giant said that it lost the lucrative project due to political influence.

The latest ruling to temporarily halt the work on the project came in response to a formal motion filed by AWS, asking the court to halt Microsoft’s work on the JEDI cloud contract.

AWS had claimed that the evaluation process that led to Microsoft winning the contract included “clear deficiencies, errors and unmistakable bias.”

“While we are disappointed with the additional delay we believe that we will ultimately be able to move forward with the work to make sure those who serve our country can access the new technology they urgently require,” Microsoft was quoted as saying in a statement:

“We have confidence in the Department of Defence, and we believe the facts will show they ran a detailed, thorough and fair process in determining the needs of the warfighter were best met by Microsoft,” the statement added.

The US Department of Defence also expressed its disappointment over the ruling.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/z6ad4g/article30740387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16NETMICROSOFT,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/microsoft-temporarily-blocked-from-beginning-pentagon-project/article30818966.ece

The Department of Telecom withdrew its order stating that no coercive action should be taken against telecom companies for failing to comply with the Supreme Court order to pay Adjusted Gross Revenue-related dues with immediate effect.

While withdrawing the order with immediate effect, the new order also directs that “immediate necessary action” is taken to comply with the October last order that had directed telcos to pay their dues within three months or by January 24.

We (I and two more journalists) are in transit from Jodhpur to Khimsar. A two-hour, 100-kilometre ride. The sky has changed from glimmering golden orange to purplish black. After crossing the centuries-old forts and temples, we are on a barren, almost empty highway. Just a few dhabas, fuel stations and dirty green thorny plants to look from the car window. The phone, to preserve charge, has been switched off. A prolonged period of inactivity, the lack of interesting sights, the near-constant speed and the full-blast AC of the vehicle causes torpor. Which is when we decide it’s the best time for a chai break.

The hot and spicy moong dal pakoras served with fried green chilli at the Nagori Cold Drinks tea stall mightn’t be world famous. But it’s now one of my favourite snacks. And, along with the magnificent forts and the spectacular sand dunes of Khimsar, I will equally cherish the small tea stall in Bawari during my two-day stay in Rajasthan. And, thanks to Kogo, I can locate this little known roadside stall and suggest its moong dal pakora.

The soapbar-sized, octagonal gadget (KogoBOT) — which you can carry or attach to your vehicle — has a dedicated GPS and multiple sensors to map the journey. And, the KogoApp takes the data captured by the device and uses Artificial Intelligence to create stories of your travels.

HOW KOGO WORKS Start a trip by entering the destination and choose your sharing preference.

Kogo will create a title for the trip (which you can edit) and start tracking the journey.

After the trip, you can view the details of your trip: route, time, temperature, stops and others.

You can upload pictures and videos of your journey even after the trip; Kogo will use the files’ timestamp to chronologically slot it in your story.

Origin story

Raj K Gopalakrishnan and Praveer Kochhar conceptualised Kogo during one of their many annual trips to Spiti Valley. “We were coming back from the Sangla Valley,” says Praveer, “And, we were arguing about the location of a place where we had some amazing Maggi with chicken on our previous trip. We spent about an hour and a half trying to zero in on the place but we couldn’t. That’s when we were like, ‘We travel so much. So, why can’t we log these things?’”

But what’s the need for a new device when your phone can do it?

Praveer answers, “I have used a dozen tracking apps. A lot of these apps use the phone’s GPS. For long duration trips, you need to have the app running all the time in the foreground for the GPS to function. But if you have to use say, WhatsApp or Facebook, then, the apps that aren’t being used go to the background.” In an effort to reduce power consumption, the latest versions of Android limits background apps to receive location updates only a few times every hour, which reduces the mapping accuracy.

Secondly, the KogoBOT is a powerhouse. It can last up to seven days on a single full charge, and save up to 10 days of data even when there is no network.

Praveer’s third reason is privacy. “We foresee that permanent taking of location from mobile phones is going to be completely absent. It might even happen within the next year. Because it is quite infringing on your privacy if your phone is constantly sending data, right? The beauty about Kogo is you can switch it off whenever you want.”

When does the tracking begin and end on Kogo? “The tracking happens only after you start a trip on the app and are moving. When you are stationary for 20 seconds, the device goes into sleep, so it can conserve battery. The device’s vibration sensor knows when you are moving, so, it wakes up and starts tracking again.” Once you end the trip, the device — if it’s on and moving — sends what Praveer calls “location pings” once in three minutes. And, it stops tracking when switched off.

The Kogo App is a work in progress. It, for instance, doesn’t have enough photo or video editing options. Video streaming is often slow. The destination can’t be changed after the trip starts.

What’s in store?

Praveer promises significant additons to the app in the next few months. “You will have the option to discuss a trip with other users. The second thing is: you will be able to book experiences on the app. For example, we have partnered with Homestays of India, which has over 100 properties across India.”

The KogoBOT, priced ₹7,749 (including a one-year subscription of the KogoApp as an introductory offer), caters mainly to regular road-trippers — occasional travellers might consider it an expensive option. Praveer, however, reckons this niche audience is sufficient for Kogo’s growth. “In India, we identified about 1.3 crore serious travellers. Our aim for the next three years is to reach 300,000 of them and 450,000 outside India.” Kogo’s targetting is to cover a million kilometers within a year for which the company has partnered with JAWA Motorcycle Company to cover 3,00,000 kilometers.

“This is just the start,” says Praveer.

9,2020/02/14,This Virtual Reality Lab in Kerala capital gives you a sneak-peek into the fast-emerging technology,"Keltron’s Virtual Reality Lab in Thiruvananthapuram opens doors for a hands-on experience in the fast-emerging technologies of virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality

As I soak in the breathtaking beauty of undersea life with its coral habitats and schools of multi-hued fishes, a gurgle of sorts seem to echo from afar. Soon, a sea of light-emitting jellyfishes swim into the picture and swarm around me as they make their way across the ethereal waters. But mistake not that I’m actually standing on the ocean floor, as instead of swimming goggles and scuba tank, what I have on is a Virtual Reality (VR) headset with a pair of earphones attached.

The Virtual Reality Lab, flagged off recently at Keltron House, Vellayambalam, opens doors for a hands-on experience in the fast-emerging technologies of virtual reality, augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality that simulate real-life impressions. With four consoles in operation now, the lab offers a peek into the immersive world of 360 degrees VR simulation through demo apps.

“The objective is to introduce the public to advancements in 3D design through the state-of-the-art technology of Virtual Reality, which holds a lot of promise for entertainment and infontainment. It shows how technology is advancing beyond the 3D. One highlight of the lab is the Mixed Reality experience, which blends VR and AR to make it more interactive,” says Ajayakumar CP, manager of Keltron’s Knowledge Services Group under which the facility has been set up.

The interface uses a VR headset and a pair of motion controllers with tracking sensors that enables the user to navigate through the display projected inside the headset. Immersive demo simulations on offer include undersea life, space adventure, anatomy and health, first-person games and more.

Those looking to go on a sortie on the edge of space get to “be an astronaut” aboard the International Space Station with a voice narration for accompaniment. But there’s a mission: manoeuvre your way outside the space shuttle and fix a faulty solar panel. The bonus is a stunning view of a haloed earth, as seen so far from the terrestrial world. Another simulation, a roller-coaster ride, is perhaps not for the faint-hearted.

If astronomy is your interest, get wired in for an interplanetary experience of the Solar System that lets you learn about the planets and the universe. Another demo features a dizzying, bird’s eye view of a futuristic city, resembling scenes right out of some sci-fi flick. The health module lets you zoom in on the human anatomy with brilliant microscopic, 360 degrees visualisations of various organs, inside and outside. Then there’s a simulation of the Italian capital city of Rome that virtually serves as a guided city tour. Those into video games can go on a do-or-die adventure through the first-person game Superhot VR.

Anandhu JS, a VR lab instructor, says the simulations are downloadable apps, which are then customised for the user’s convenience, even as the lab plans to add more simulations from various fields. The lab has been set up in partnership with real-time development platform Unity, with infrastructure support from HP, explains Ajayakumar, adding that the facility is open for those aged 13 and above.

The VR lab currently offers three packages spanning 15 minutes each for visitors to experience.

10,2020/02/14,Israeli strikes kill seven in Damascus,"Three were Syrian soldiers and the rest were members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard

Israeli strikes on Damascus airport killed seven fighters, a war monitor said on Friday, the latest in a string of attacks targeting Iran’s military presence in Syria.

Syrian State media said only that its air defences intercepted missiles over the capital overnight while Israel did not immediately comment on the strikes.

Israel routinely fires missiles at what it says are Iranian targets in Syria, where elite Iranian forces and allied militia play a key role.

According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the strikes launched late on Thursday hit military targets in the area of the international airport.

Rami Abdel Rahman, the director of the Britain-based Observatory, said the dead were three Syrian soldiers and four members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard.

“Our air defences intercepted hostile targets over the skies of Damascus,” SANA said. It said the “missiles were launched from over the occupied Golan Heights”.

Missiles intercepted

Several missiles were intercepted before they could reach their targets, said the agency, which rarely admits to casualties among Army or Iranian ranks.

The Observatory said the targets in the airport area, which has been repeatedly hit in similar strikes, included an arms depot.

The strikes on the airport came just after the arrival of a cargo plane, according to Abdel Rahman, who could not specify where the aircraft had flown in from.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israeli-strikes-kill-seven-in-damascus/article30824249.ece
11,2020/02/14,"Big setback if India and U.S. can’t agree on trade deal now, says top U.S. diplomat Alice Wells","Ms. Wells will not be accompanying Mr Trump to India and neither will Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

If India and the U.S. cannot achieve a modest trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump visiting India, it would be a “big setback”, the U.S.’s top diplomat for South and Central Asia, Alice Wells said. U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer cancelling his trip this week to India cast doubt on whether a mini trade deal could be completed before the February 24 visit of Mr Trump. Mr. Lighthizer will possibly visit along with Mr. Trump, The Hindu had reported, leaving open the possibility that a modest agreement could be finalised.

Ms. Wells said that if a “tiny phase 1 trade deal” with the U.S. President visiting India could not be achieved, it would be a “big setback”. She was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a United States India Business Council (USIBC) welcome reception for Indian Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu on February 13 evening.

“They continue to try and finalize an agreement,” Ms. Wells said, adding that she however said that she could not speak for the Office of USTR and is not privy to the details of the negotiation. She said the U.S. would like to have “a lot more ambitions” for making India part of the global supply chain but that the U.S. experience in negotiating trade was “very painful” and that the policy directions in India – including in the recent Union Budget as well as the e-commerce policy ( a draft was introduced in early 2019) were of concern.

Ms. Wells herself will not be accompanying Mr. Trump to India and neither will Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. They will stay behind in Washington for a Chief of Missions conference. US envoy to India Kenneth Juster will represent the State Department in India during the presidential visit.

Trump concerned about India-Pak tensions

In response to a question from The Hindu on whether Mr. Trump would offer to mediate between India and Pakistan regarding the Kashmir issue , Ms. Wells said the U.S. President is aware that India is not interested in mediation but that Mr. Trump is “genuinely interested” in how India and Pakistan are managing tensions and “concerned” about the tensions. Mr. Trump has , more than once, said that he has good relationships with both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. He has also repeatedly offered his mediation services.

“If we can help, we certainly will be helping,” Mr. Trump had said at the World Economic Forum in January, in the presence of Mr. Khan.

US thinks Australia should join Malabar naval exercise

“We think it’s time,” Ms. Wells said on the question of Australia participating in the U.S.-India-Japan naval wargames, the Malabar Exercise. Concerns about the message Australian participation would send China (Australia is part of the ‘Quad’ group with India, the U.S. and Japan) have, historically, made India reluctant to permit Australia’s participation in the exercises.

Ms. Wells said it would be a “good gesture” to even have Australia as an observer, adding that she was “very struck” by how positive the India Australia relationship is right now.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3oenf9/article30824224.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AliceWells-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/big-setback-if-india-and-us-cant-agree-on-trade-deal-now-says-top-us-diplomat-alice-wells/article30824248.ece
12,2020/02/14,Baby born on boat among 87 saved off Canary Islands,"They were all migrants from Africa

A baby born on a rickety boat bound for the Canary Islands was one of 87 migrants picked up by rescuers overnight, Spanish rescuers said on Friday.

The migrants, all of them from sub-Saharan Africa, were travelling on three boats which were picked up just south of the island of Gran Canaria, a spokeswoman for the Salvamento Maritimo rescue service said.

“A new-born baby was rescued and it seems that the mother gave birth in the boat just beforehand,” she said, without specifying the sex of the infant but saying both mother and baby were “doing well”.

There were 54 people in the first two boats which were picked up on Thursday evening about 60 nautical miles south of Gran Canaria, and rescuers came across another vessel carrying 33 people as they were just off the island, she said.

Among those rescued were 30 women, six babies and four other children, while the rest were men, with all taken to the southern port of Arguinerin, she said.

In early January, another baby born aboard a makeshift boat carrying 43 migrants did not survive the journey and was declared dead.

In January, the number of migrants reaching the Canaries soared to 708 – 18 times the level of a year ago when it stood at 40, government figures showed, raising fears of a resurgence of migrant traffic to the Atlantic islands, a route taken by tens of thousands of people a decade ago.

As Morocco has waged a crackdown on illegal immigration, there has been an increasing number of people trying to reach the Spanish islands by boat from Mauritania, whose coastline lies 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) to the south.

As well as the Canaries route, other migrants have sought to sail to mainland Spain from Algeria's northern coast.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/baby-born-on-boat-among-87-saved-off-canary-islands/article30824183.ece
13,2020/02/14,Donald Trump insists he can intervene in criminal cases,"Barr had said that Trump’s tweets made his job difficult

President Donald Trump dismissed rare criticism from his Attorney General Friday, tweeting that he has the “legal right” to intervene in criminal cases whenever he likes.

The Republican businessman has been accused by opponents in Congress of trying to strip away the Justice Department’s independence to benefit himself and his allies.

He denies this but on Thursday he came under fire from his own Attorney General William Barr, who complained that Mr. Trump’s frequent tweeting about ongoing criminal cases meant “I cannot do my job.” Mr. Barr told ABC News television that “it’s time to stop the tweeting.”

Mr. Trump’s said in a tweet on Friday, “This doesn’t mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!”

Mr. Barr’s unusual outburst followed controversy over former Mr. Trump adviser Roger Stone, who has been convicted of witness tampering and lying to Congress.

When prosecutors recommended a sentence of seven to nine years, Mr. Trump tweeted that this was a “miscarriage of justice.”

Shortly after, in a move that shocked many, the Justice Department announced it was seeking a less severe sentence. Four prosecutors quit the case in protest.

Mr. Barr, who has been frequently accused of being too cozy with the president, told ABC that Trump “has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cszzio/article30824093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-William-Barr,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-insists-he-can-intervene-in-criminal-cases/article30824094.ece

The former New York Mayor rallied supporters in Texas on Thursday, with his sights set on “Super Tuesday” on March 3, when voters in 16 States and territories will cast their ballots in the Democratic primary.

15,2020/02/14,U.S. blacklists Sri Lankan Army Chief citing killings and abuses,"The sanctions imposed by Washington bar Lt. gen. Silva and his family members from entering the U.S.

The United States has blacklisted Sri Lanka's Army Chief, Shavendra Silva, for human rights violations including extrajudicial killings during the last phase of the country's civil war in 2009, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on February 14.

“The allegations of gross human rights violations against Shavendra Silva, documented by the United Nations and other organisations, are serious and credible,” Mr. Pompeo said in a statement.

The sanctions imposed on February 14 by Washington bar Lt. gen. Silva and his family members from entering the United States.

Lt. Gen. Silva’s appointment as Army commander in August 2019 drew sharp criticism from the United States and the United Nations.

Lt. Gen. Silva is credited with leading an Army division against Tamil Tiger rebels in the final phases of the island nation’s 26-year-long brutal civil war, which ended in 2009.

His victory, however, was highly controversial. Thousands of civilians were killed in the last phases of the armed conflict, including in areas declared by the government to be a ‘no fire zone’, which came under sustained Army shelling, including hospitals.

16,2020/02/14,Coronavirus outbreak: Tibet’s Nyingchi discourages tourists from visiting the remote region,"Tibet has activated an emergency response and warned that the outbreak of the disease could be much worse.

Nyingchi, a popular tourist city in Tibet, has stopped thousands of tourists from visiting the remote region due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus epidemic that has hit China.

Tourism is one the main source of revenue for picturesque Himalayan region. The death toll in China’s novel coronavirus outbreak has spiked to nearly 1,500 with 121 new fatalities reported mostly from the worst-affected Hubei province while the confirmed cases of infection jumped to nearly 65,000, according to the health officials.

Tibet has activated an emergency response and warned that the outbreak of the disease could be much worse due to the plateau’s low oxygen concentration and limited medical resources, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

Also, under a new regulation of the city’s disease control headquarters, all the passengers arriving in Tibet must go through 14 days of medical observation and quarantine.

The city’s transportation sector has since dissuaded 41 tourist groups from entering and cancelled three tourist charter flights involving about 5,000 tourists, the report said.

“The Nyingchi airport also sent notices to 3,276 passengers on 59 flights and persuaded 771 to drop their travel plans and another 31 to return after landing,” the report said.

17,2020/02/14,"Vijay Mallya says ED, CBI been ‘totally unreasonable’","Lord Justice Stephen Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing, the two-member bench presiding over the High Court appeal, will hand down their verdict at a later date.

Embattled liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya has claimed that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) have treated him “unreasonably” over the past four years.

The 64-year-old former Kingfisher Airlines boss is appealing against his extradition order to India on charges of fraud and money laundering amounting to an alleged ₹9,000 crores in unpaid bank loans.

His lawyers told the British High Court this week that he had been the victim of the airline industry’s misfortunes and had no fraudulent intentions behind seeking loans for his now-defunct airline.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, countered the claims and stressed that there is a prima facie case for him to answer in the Indian courts.

The Enforcement Directorate attached the assets on the complaint by the banks that I was not paying them. I have not committed any offences under the PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) that the Enforcement Directorate should suo moto attach my assets,” he told reporters at the end of his three-day appeal hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London on Thursday.

“I am saying, please banks take your money. The ED is saying no, we have a claim over these assets. So, the ED on the one side and the banks on the other are fighting over the same assets What all they are doing to me for the last four years is totally unreasonable,” he said.

Representatives from the ED and CBI were present in court this week and took notes during the course of the appeal hearing, which began on Tuesday and concluded on Thursday.

Mr. Mallya also reiterated his message for the Indian banks to take back 100% of the principal amount owed to them, which he stressed had not been borrowed by him but by Kingfisher Airlines.

“ I request the banks with folded hands, take 100 per cent of your principal back, immediately I am willing to honour my guarantee and pay them in full. I do not want any discount on principal and the hangover of loss of public money,” he said.

“Under the bankruptcy code, so many companies are now changing hands with significant haircuts being taken by banks. I don’t want any haircut, I want them to take their money in full,” added Mr. Mallya, who has been based in the UK since March 2016.

Lord Justice Stephen Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing, the two-member bench presiding over the High Court appeal, will hand down their verdict at a later date after considering the oral as well as written submissions in the very dense case.

“We submit that he lied to get the loans, then did something with the money he wasn’t supposed to and then refused to give back the money. All this could be perceived by a jury as patently dishonest conduct,” CPS barrister Mark Summers told the court.

He referred to balance sheets and emails to counter Mr. Mallya’s lawyers’ claims that Westminster Magistrates Court Judge Emma Arbuthnot had fallen into error when she found a case to answer in the Indian courts against Mr. Mallya.

Mr. Mallya had received permission to appeal against his extradition order signed off by former UK home secretary Sajid Javid last February on the ground that the Indian government’s prima facie case against him of fraudulent intentions in acquiring bank loans had not been established.

At the end of a year-long extradition trial at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London in December 2018, Judge Arbuthnot concluded she found clear evidence of dispersal and misapplication of the loan funds .

Mr. Mallya remains on bail since his arrest on an extradition warrant in April 2017 while he contests that ruling.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9edvsf/article30821420.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIJAYMALLYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vijay-mallya-says-ed-cbi-been-totally-unreasonable/article30821421.ece
18,2020/02/14,Cruise industry avoids Asia as it seeks to limit coronavirus risks,"Many cruises in the region are being cancelled while others currently sailing are being re-routed, skipping originally scheduled stops in China, Hong Kong and Singapore

The plight of the cruise ship off Japan with more than 200 coronavirus infections and the shunning of another by five ports despite no known cases has led to a sharp change in tack for an industry in shock: avoid Asia.

To that end, many cruises in the region are being cancelled while others currently sailing are being re-routed, skipping originally scheduled stops in China, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Also read | China coronavirus COVID-19 | No major change in trajectory of outbreak, says WHO

Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd on Thursday cancelled 18 cruises in Southeast Asia after calling off eight trips to China last week. It joined industry leader Carnival Corp in warning that full-year earnings would be hit by the epidemic.

“It is important that every organization acts responsibly, and we have already taken aggressive steps to minimize risk through boarding restrictions and itinerary changes,” CEO Richard Fain said in a statement.

The flu-like virus has so far claimed 1,380 lives with the total number of infections at more than 63,000, most of them in China.

Asia accounts for just some 10% of the global cruise industry, according to the Cruise Lines International Association.

But the fear is that the negative headlines generated by the predicament of the Diamond Princess ship off Japan — the location of the most new coronavirus infections outside China — as well as by the two-week shunning of the MS Westerdam will spill over to the entire industry.

“While the early impact due to concerns about the coronavirus is mainly related to Asia, recent bookings for our broader business have also been softer,” Royal Caribbean said in its statement.

The Cruise Lines International Association said it was confident in its members’ “resilience and ability to overcome current challenges over the long-term.”

Rescheduled stops

Ships re-routing include the Cunard Line’s Queen Mary 2, owned by Carnival, which has cancelled a stop in Singapore scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, and is sailing straight to Fremantle, Australia.

Another Cunard ship, the Queen Elizabeth, called off stops in Hong Kong and Shanghai through April 4. Its revised itinerary has yet to be announced.

Both Royal Caribbean and Carnival have introduced enhanced safety measures, denying permission to board to planned guests who have been through mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau in the preceding two weeks and initiating mandatory health screenings of other guests who may be at risk due to their travel history.

The Norwegian Spirit liner will no longer conclude its March cruise in Singapore but will end in Greece, and its Asia itineraries from April through December 2020 have also been cancelled, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings said.

Similarly, P&O Cruises’ Arcadia liner has removed stops in Shanghai and Hong Kong in March, although it has yet to announce alternative ports.

Fears about the impact of the outbreak have driven sharp slides in the shares of the industry’s top three liners, which together had some $34 billion in revenue in 2018.

Both Carnival and Royal Caribbean have seen their shares lose about 15% for the year to date, while Norwegian Cruise Line has fallen 8.5%.

The MS Westerdam was finally allowed to dock in Cambodia on Thursday and passengers began disembarking on Friday.

The Diamond Princess cruise ship, also owned by Carnival and which has been quarantined since it arrived in Yokohama on February 3, now has 218 cases among its 3,500 passengers and crew.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/s7mb53/article30818929.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DIAMONDPRINCESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cruise-industry-avoids-asia-as-it-seeks-to-limit-coronavirus-risks/article30818930.ece
19,2020/02/14,"Inter-governmental negotiations meant to achieve UNSC reform, not endless debate: G4","The Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN) format has long outlived its sell-by date and must be made transparent to ensure progress on the reform discussions, they said.

The G4 nations of Brazil, Germany, Japan and India have asserted that the mandate of the United Nations’ Inter-Governmental Negotiations is to achieve the long-pending reforms of the UNSC and not endlessly debate it.

The Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN) format has long outlived its sell-by date and must be made transparent to ensure progress on the reform discussions, they said.

India has been calling for the reform of the UN Security Council (UNSC) along with Brazil, Germany and Japan for long, emphasising that it rightly deserves a place at the UN high table as a permanent member.

The G4 nations support each other’s bids for permanent seats on the UNSC.

Speaking on behalf of the G4 nations, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin called on the UN member states to strive for the progress in IGN negotiations.

“We see the discussion in the IGN as intrinsically linked to the outcome to be decided in the General Assembly. These are a continuum. Progress here will inevitably determine the outcome we adopt in the General Assembly,” Mr. Akbaruddin said Thursday at the informal meeting of the General Assembly on the IGN on Security Council Reform.

“Lack of progress not only endangers the legitimacy and credibility of this mechanism but the General Assembly itself. We seek credible progress. However, if this eludes us once more, we are ready to review how we engage on this very important issue,” he said.

Referring to the adage ‘If you want something new, you have to stop doing something old’, Akbaruddin underscored that the “mandate of the IGN is to achieve reform, not to endlessly debate it”.

The G4 also underscored the need for the format of the IGN to replicate processes that are followed in other mechanisms of the General Assembly (GA) with considerable success.

“The current format of the IGN has long outlived its sell-by date. As is the case with other GA negotiation formats, the IGN must be transparent and traceable to enhance the possibility of building on successive discussions and avoiding mere repetition of statements,” the Indian envoy said.

He voiced hope that co-chairs of the IGN process Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to the UN Lana Nusseibeh and Ambassador of Poland Joanna Wronecka will steer the UN membership in a manner that leads to the Security Council being fit for purpose, “in what is left of the 21st century“.

The G4 nations pointed out that there is a “rising sense of urgency and impatience” with a process that is increasingly seen as “impeding progress rather than enabling it,” underscoring the need to focus on specifics, rather than on general concepts.

The G4 countries said that the current session of the GA should result in a single, inclusive and holistic document as an outcome of the discussions, so that member states can engage in negotiations based on it from the start of the 75th session.

In this regard, Mr. Akbaruddin said that the G4 nations submit that a technical approach that builds on the past is adopted.

With the revised paper of June 2019 being the most recent outcome of discussions among the UN member states, Mr. Akbaruddin said an opportunity must be provided to every member to indicate what they want to be addressed as an issue listed for further consideration in this paper.

He noted that the vast majority of member states are in favour of expansion in both - permanent and non-permanent categories of membership of the Security Council.

“Our approach is that every stakeholder’s proposal should be listed; none should be left behind,” he said, adding that the G4 nations are seeking equal opportunities for everybody to present their proposals for inclusion in a single document.

“Such a document will provide clarity to where we stand, what are the options on the table, and who is proposing them,” the G4 statement said.

Mr. Akbaruddin also highlighted that the first iteration of the single, inclusive and holistic document must be produced ahead of the next meeting in this cycle of the IGN to allow maximum time for discussions to refine it.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/31e0ej/article29475333.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SYEDAKBARUDDIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/inter-governmental-negotiations-meant-to-achieve-unsc-reform-not-endless-debate-g4/article30818839.ece
20,2020/02/14,Novel coronavirus inflicts growing toll on Chinese health workers,"1,716 of them have been infected and six have died in China even as the total number of infections goes up to 63,851.

The new coronavirus has taken a growing toll of Chinese health workers on the front line of the fight to stop it, a top official said on Friday, as authorities reported more than 5,000 new cases, including more than 120 deaths.

China's National Health Commission said it had recorded 121 new deaths and 5,090 new coronavirus cases on the mainland on Thursday, taking the total number of infected to 63,851.

Some 55,748 people are being treated, while 1,380 people have died of the virus that emerged in December in Wuhan, capital of the central province of Hubei.

The latest toll takes account of some deaths that had been double counted in Hubei, the commission said.

The Chinese Health Commission Vice-Minister, Zeng Yixin, said 1,716 health workers had been infected and six had died as of Tuesday, with the number of infected staff rising.

“The duties of medical workers at the front are indeed extremely heavy; their working and resting circumstances are limited, the psychological pressures are great, and the risk of infection is high,” Mr. Zeng told a news conference.

Chinese officials and hospitals have repeatedly spoken of a shortage of protective equipment, including face masks.

The new figures for total infections gave no sign the outbreak was nearing a peak, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney.

Drastic measures

“While the Chinese authorities are doing their best to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the fairly drastic measures they have implemented to date would appear to have been too little, too late,” he said.

Chinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs and preliminary results are due in weeks, while the head of a Wuhan hospital said plasma infusions from recovered patients had shown some encouraging preliminary results.

While the vast majority of infections and deaths have been in China, in particular Hubei, there have been nearly 450 cases in some 24 countries and territories outside mainland China, and three deaths. Japan confirmed its first coronavirus death on Thursday. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines.

The biggest cluster of infections outside China has been on a cruise liner quarantined in a Japanese port, with 218 people on board confirmed as infected and taken off to hospital.

A series of avalanches struck a central province in Afghanistan the previous day, killing at least 21 people, authorities said on Friday.

According to Ahmad Tameem Azimi, spokesman of the ministry for disaster management, seven people remain missing following the avalanches in central Daykundi province on Thursday while 10 were injured.

The 21 killed were all from two families in the area, Mr. Azimi said. At least 50 houses were destroyed. Mr. Azimi added that search and rescue teams have been working since Thursday to find the missing and help the victims.

This winter in Afghanistan has been harsh, with heavy snowfall, avalanches and flash flooding. Thursday’s deaths bring the death toll from avalanches and flash floods in the country in the past two months to 72. Scores have also been injured and 2,400 houses have been swept away in flash floods since the start of winter.

Afghanistan has suffered through more than four decades of war and conflict since the Soviet invasion in 1979.

22,2020/02/14,Shelling wounds at least 19 children in Myanmars Rakhine: authorities,"The Arakan Army, which recruits from the mostly Buddhist majority, has been fighting for greater autonomy for the western region from the central government.

At least 19 children were wounded when a primary school was hit by shelling in Myanmar's Rakhine state, a lawmaker and a military spokesman said on Thursday.

Clashes between government troops and ethnic insurgents have intensified in Rakhine, from where tens of thousands of people have been displaced since clashes began in December 2018, bringing new chaos to the region from which more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled a military crackdown in 2017.

The Arakan Army, which recruits from the mostly Buddhist majority, has been fighting for greater autonomy for the western region from the central government.

Artillery fire hit the school in Khamwe Chaung village in Buthidaung township on Thursday morning, Tun Aung Thein, a local member of parliament, told Reuters by telephone. He said he did not know who was responsible.

“According to the health department, 19 students are injured and one is seriously injured,” the lawmaker said.

A military spokesman put the number of wounded at 20, and blamed the insurgents for the attack.

“We medically treated the students at the nearby military post and sent five to the hospital,” Brigadier-General Zaw Min Tun told Reuters by phone.

A spokesman for the Arakan Army, denied its fighters were responsible, saying they did not have such artillery, and blamed government troops.

The British embassy in Myanmar issued a statement urging an end to the violence, which follows the reinstatement last week of an internet shutdown in the region.

“The increased violence in Rakhine state over the past few days is causing misery for many of the people living there,” said Dan Chugg, British ambassador to Myanmar.

“Todays reported shelling of a school on Myanmars Childrens Day, following recent deaths of women and children, highlights the impact this is having on innocent people.”

The statement urged all sides to do their utmost to protect civilians and called on the government to lift the internet restrictions.

A months-long internet blackout in four Rakhine townships including Buthidaung - and one in neighboring Chin state had been lifted in September as peace talks sought to end clashes.

Officials cited “security requirements and public interest” for the reinstatement.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article23570566.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-PULITZER11,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/shelling-wounds-at-least-19-children-in-myanmars-rakhine-authorities/article30817558.ece
23,2020/02/14,U.S. says it’s ready to help North Korea combat virus,"The State Department statement comes as North Korea scrambles to strengthen quarantine and preventive measures following an explosion of infections in China that killed hundreds and sickened tens of thousands.

The United States has expressed deep concern about North Korea’s vulnerability to the outbreak of a new virus and says it’s ready to support efforts by U.S. and international aid organizations to contain the spread of the illness in the impoverished nation.

The State Department statement comes as North Korea scrambles to strengthen quarantine and preventive measures following an explosion of infections in China that killed hundreds and sickened tens of thousands.

North Korea has yet to report a case of the new virus, but state media reports have hinted that an uncertain number of people have been quarantined after showing symptoms. Experts say an epidemic in North Korea could be dire because of its chronic lack of medical supplies and poor health care infrastructure.

""We strongly support and encourage the work of U.S. and international aid and health organizations to counter and contain the spread of coronavirus in the DPRK,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement, referring to North Korea by its formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

""The United States is ready and prepared to expeditiously facilitate the approval of assistance from these organizations.”

North Korea has banned foreign tourists, intensified screening at airports, harbors and border areas, and mobilized some 30,000 health workers to monitor residents in a tough campaign to prevent the spread of the virus, which state media has described as a matter of “national existence.” The North also had rival South Korea withdraw dozens of officials from an inter-Korean liaison office in the North Korean border town of Kaesong, insisting on closing it until the epidemic is controlled.

The North this week also announced it will impose a monthlong quarantine for all foreign visitors and others suspected to have the virus. The report by state media didn’t confirm the country’s previous quarantine period, but the Russian Embassy in Pyongyang said in a Facebook post earlier this month that North Korea was putting foreign visitors under a 15-day quarantine.

""All the institutions and fields of the state and foreigners staying in the DPRK should obey it unconditionally,” the Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday. “The spread of the epidemic comes to be a serious problem with the possibility of international disaster.”

South Korea, which has reported 28 cases of the virus, said there’s a need for inter-Korean cooperation to contain the spread of the disease. Cho Hey-sil, spokeswoman of Seoul’s Unification Ministry, which deals with inter-Korean affairs, said Friday her government will consider public opinion before deciding whether to formally propose joint quarantine efforts with the North.

Police took a man into custody Friday after he fired multiple gunshots into the air in central Bangkok, injuring no one less than a week after a soldier killed 29 people in shooting rampage in northeastern Thailand.

The incident in the Thai capital was related to a personal conflict, Lt. Gen. Pakkapong Pongpetra, chief of the Metropolitan Police Bureau, told reporters.

The man was reported to have fired 20-40 shots during the incident lasting more than six hours in a residential neighborhood with small shops, many selling sporting goods, next to Chulalongkorn University.

Police had cleared the area around the building and Thai media reported a family member was brought in to try to convince him to surrender.

25,2020/02/14,"Japan vows to step up efforts on coronavirus testing, containment after first fatality","Japan's health ministry said on Thursday that a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture, just to the west of Tokyo, had died. She was transferred between hospitals as her condition worsened and was only confirmed to have the coronavirus after her death.

Japan on Friday vowed to step up testing and containment efforts for the coronavirus after suffering its first death and the confirmation of new cases, including a doctor and taxi driver.

Japan's health ministry said on Thursday that a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture, just to the west of Tokyo, had died. She was transferred between hospitals as her condition worsened and was only confirmed to have the coronavirus after her death.

A Tokyo taxi driver, who Japanese media said was the woman's son-in-law, as well as a man in his 20s just east of Tokyo and a doctor in Wakayama, western Japan, were also confirmed to have the virus.

“We will stay in touch with local governments and expand our testing procedures and treatment of patients in order to prevent the spread of the illness,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters, a day after a task force on the disease drew up new measures to deal with it, including spending 10.3 billion yen from budget reserves.

Planners will also keep in close contact with Japan's military, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference, without giving further details.

He said the number of people confirmed to have the virus in Japan had risen to 33, with another 218 on a cruise ship quarantined at a port in Yokohama.

Japanese media reported after Mr. Suga's remarks that a man in Wakayama, at the same hospital as the doctor, had also tested positive.

Both Mr. Suga and Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said there was no evidence the coronavirus, dubbed SARS-CoV-2, was spreading widely in Japan, although Kato said that it might and that the government needed prepare for that situation.

Separately, some passengers on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which has been moored Yokohama, just south of Tokyo, were set to start disembarking on Friday instead of waiting for the originally targeted date of Feb. 19.

Elderly passengers who have medical conditions or are in windowless rooms can complete their quarantine onshore, Kato said.

The ship was quarantined on arrival in Yokohama, near Tokyo, on Feb. 3 after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong before it travelled to Japan was diagnosed with the virus, which has now killed more than 1,350 people in mainland China.

About 80% of the ship's passengers are 60 or older, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in their 90s, according to Japanese media. The ship, managed by Princess Cruise Lines and owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp, typically has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/u4shgd/article30699279.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAPAN-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/japan-vows-to-step-up-efforts-on-coronavirus-testing-containment-after-first-fatality/article30817308.ece
26,2020/02/14,Final appeal over Pell sexual offence conviction set for March 11-12,"The former Vatican treasurer, who once helped elect popes, was found guilty by a jury in December 2018 of five charges of abusing the choirboys when he was the archbishop of Melbourne

The final appeal by Cardinal George Pell against his child sexual abuse convictions will be held by Australia’s High Court on March 11-12, the court announced Friday.

It is the final avenue for the 78-year-old— who is serving a six-year sentence for sexually assaulting two choirboys in a Melbourne cathedral in the 1990s— to get out of jail.

The former Vatican treasurer, who once helped elect popes, was found guilty by a jury in December 2018 of five charges of abusing the choirboys when he was the archbishop of Melbourne.

He was sentenced the following March and lost a first appeal in August in Victoria state’s Court of Appeal in a landmark decision that saw the judges split in a 2-1 verdict.

That division— which saw two judges back the jury’s verdict and the dissenting judge side with Pell— is at the forefront of his latest bid to overturn the convictions.

The case pitted the most senior convicted Catholic child molester against a former choirboy now in his 30s, who two of the judges found to be “very compelling” and someone who “was clearly not a liar, was not a fantasist and was a witness of truth“.

The third judge, however, found the victim’s account “contained discrepancies” and there was a “significant possibility” Pell did not commit the offences.

Court documents show his legal team are mounting two grounds of appeal, with the key argument being that the majority judges applied an “erroneous judicial method” in “upholding with the jury’s verdict“.

The second contends there was not enough time for Pell to have molested the boys in the priests’ sacristy during a five to six minute period after Sunday Mass ended and the area became a “hive of activity“.

The High Court receives about 500 appeal applications each year but only agrees to hear about 35.

A spokesman said the High Court justices could announce a ruling on Pell’s appeal at the end of the two-day hearing, or withhold judgement to a later date.

During Pell’s trial under a court-ordered veil of secrecy, the Vatican gradually removed him from top Church bodies with little explanation.

Shortly after his conviction, Pell was removed from the so-called C9 Council of Cardinals that are effectively the Pope’s cabinet and inner circle of advisers.

The Vatican later dropped him as the church’s finance chief but said it would avoid launching an investigation into his conduct until after all legal avenues are exhausted.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/3x6yvi/article26372382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AVDCARDINAL-01,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/final-appeal-over-pell-sexual-offence-conviction-set-for-march-11-12/article30817292.ece

Death toll in China’s coronavirus epidemic has gone up to 1,483 with Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, reporting 116 new fatalities, the country’s health officials said on Friday.

The hard-hit province reported 4,823 new confirmed cases on Thursday, the provincial health commission said.

The new cases included 3,095 clinically diagnosed ones which have been considered as confirmed, state run Xinhua news agency reported.

The latest report brought the total confirmed cases in the province to 51,986, the report said. The new cases have pushed the number of infections in the country to 64,627 in total.

The National Health Commission has not yet announced the nationwide figures.

On Thursday the commission had announced 254 fatalities as authorities adopted a new diagnosis method amid concerns. Of the total deaths, 242 were from Hubei province and 12 from other provinces.

The World Health Organization on Thursday had said that a sharp rise in reported COVID-19, (official name for coronavirus) cases in China was due to a change in counting methods and it did not represent a big shift in the epidemic.

“This does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,” Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme told a press conference in Geneva.

“We’re not dealing, from what we understand, with a spike in cases of 14,000 on one day,” he said.

“This increase that you’ve all seen in the last 24 hours is largely, in part, down to a change in how the cases are being reported,” he said.

Ryan also said that he expected members of a WHO-led international mission to arrive in China over the weekend.

28,2020/02/14,Passengers on ship turned away over virus fears disembark in Cambodia,"After tests, no one on board was found to be carrying the virus, Cambodia's health ministry said.

Passengers on a cruise ship that spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by five countries over coronavirus fears started disembarking in Cambodia on Friday.

The MS Westerdam, carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew, docked in the Cambodian port town of Sihanoukville on Thursday. It had anchored offshore early in the morning to allow Cambodian officials to board and collect samples from passengers with any signs of ill health or flu-like symptoms.

After tests, no one on board was found to be carrying the virus, Cambodia's health ministry said.

Cambodian authorities granted permission for passengers to disembark on Friday morning, the ship's operator, Holland America Line, a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp, said in an emailed statement, ending two weeks of uncertainty for the cruise.

Charter flights were being organised to help passengers return home, the statement said.

“Flight details are being communicated to guests as they are finalized, and it is expected that a full disembarkation will take a few days given the charter flight schedule,” the statement said.

The sound of cheering inside the ship could be heard from Sihanoukville port when the Westerdam finally docked on Thursday evening.

Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen personally greeted the passengers with handshakes and bouquets of roses as they stepped off the ship and boarded a waiting bus.

“My wife and I gave him some chocolates as a show of our appreciation,” Lou Poandel, a tourist from New Jersey, told Reuters after he disembarked and met the Cambodian leader.

World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Cambodia for its example of “international solidarity” that the WHO has been calling for.

Stoking authorities' fears in countries on the ship's route had been the quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp. Of the 3,700 passengers and crew on that vessel, 218 have tested positive for the virus.

On Tuesday, the Westerdam tried to dock in Bangkok, but Thai authorities denied permission. On Wednesday, a Thai Navy warship escorted it out of the Gulf of Thailand, and it set a course for Cambodia, the Marine Traffic website showed.

William Gregory, a 76-year-old American tourist, said he was very happy with how he had been treated on board during the ordeal.

A rocket hit a base in northern Iraq that hosts U.S. forces on February 13 but caused no casualties, Iraqi security sources said.

A Reuters witness said U.S. warplanes had scrambled and were soaring overhead shortly after the attack on February 13. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the rocket.

The December attack was followed by retaliatory U.S. strikes that killed some two-dozen militiamen, attacks by crowds on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and then the killing by U.S. drone strike in Baghdad of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani — a series of events that brought the region close to full-scale conflict.

31,2020/02/14,U.S. brings new charges against Chinese tech giant Huawei,"The latest allegations accuse Huawei of plotting to steal the trade secrets and intellectual property of rival companies in the U.S

The Justice Department has added new criminal charges against Chinese tech giant Huawei and two of its U.S. subsidiaries, accusing the company in a plot to steal trade secrets from competitors in America, federal prosecutors announced on Thursday.

The case comes as the Trump administration is raising national security concerns about Huawei, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, and is lobbying Western allies against including the company in wireless, high-speed networks.

The new indictment brought by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn adds to the legal woes in the U.S. for Huaweiy, which already faced bank fraud charges in that district and a separate trade secrets theft in federal court in Seattle.

The latest allegations accuse Huawei of plotting to steal the trade secrets and intellectual property of rival companies in the U.S. In some cases, prosecutors said, Huawei directed and provided incentives its own employees to steal from competitors by offering bonuses to those who brought in the most valuable stolen information.

The company also used proxies, including professors at research institutions, to steal intellectual property, prosecutors said.

32,2020/02/14,Senate acts to restrain Trump’s military powers against Iran,"The measure, authored by Sen. Tim Kaine, says President Donald Trump must win approval from the Congress before engaging in further military action against Iran.

The Senate approved a bipartisan measure on February 13 limiting President Donald Trump’s authority to launch military operations against Iran.

The measure, authored by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., says Mr. Trump must win approval from the Congress before engaging in further military action against Iran. Eight Republicans joined with Democrats to pass the resolution by a 55-45 vote.

Mr. Kaine and other supporters said the resolution was not about Mr. Trump or even the presidency, but instead was an important reassertion of congressional power to declare war.

""While Trump and other Presidents must always have the ability to defend the United States from imminent attack, the executive power to initiate war stops there,” Mr. Kaine said. “An offensive war requires a congressional debate and vote.” The Democratic-controlled House passed a separate, nonbinding war powers resolution last month.

The House could take up the Senate resolution later this month, said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.

Two-thirds votes in the House and GOP-run Senate would be needed to override an expected Trump veto.

Answering a claim by some of Mr. Trump’s supporters and Mr. Trump himself that the measure would send a signal of weakness to Iran and other potential adversaries, Mr. Kaine said the opposite was true.

“When we stand up for the rule of law — in a world that hungers for more rule of law — and say ‘this decision is fundamental, and we have rules that we are going to follow so we can make a good decision,’ that’s a message of strength,” Mr. Kaine said.

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, agreed. Mr. Lee supports Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, including toward Iran, but said Congress cannot escape its constitutional responsibility to act on matters of war and peace.

What the American people and the entire world will see from the debate we’re about to have in the Senate is that there is abundant support for the United States taking tough positions with regard to Iran,” Mr. Lee said Wednesday.

“And as part of that we want to make sure that any military action that needs to be authorized is in fact properly authorized by Congress. That doesn’t show weakness. That shows strength.”’

The principle of congressional approval is established for an important reason, Mr. Kaine said. “If we’re to order our young men and women... to risk their lives in war, it should be on the basis of careful deliberation by the people’s elected legislature and not on the say-so of any one person.”

Mr. Trump disputed that, arguing in two tweets Wednesday that a vote against Mr. Kaine’s proposal was important to national security and pointed to the Jan. 3 drone strike that killed Iran’s top general, Qassem Soleimani.

We are doing very well with Iran and this is not the time to show weakness. Americans overwhelmingly support our attack on terrorist Soleimani,” Mr. Trump said.

“If my hands were tied, Iran would have a field day. Sends a very bad signal. The Democrats are only doing this as an attempt to embarrass the Republican Party. Don’t let it happen!”

Tehran responded to the U.S. attack on Soleimani by launching missiles at two military bases in Iraq that house American troops. The attack caused traumatic brain injuries in at least 64 U.S. soldiers, the Pentagon said..

Democrats and Republicans alike criticised a briefing by the Mr. Trump administration shortly after the drone strike, saying U.S. officials offered vague information about a possible attack being planned by Iran but no substantial details.

33,2020/02/14,New Hubei chief pledges to contain virus,"Top leaders are taking greater control, removing officials ‘shirking duties’

The new Communist Party chief of Hubei province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in China, said on Thursday he would contain the virus but that the situation remained severe.

Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong was brought in as party head in Hubei after his predecessor and the party chief of the province’s capital, Wuhan, became the most high-profile officials to be dismissed following the outbreak.

The removal of Jiang Chaoliang, the leading Communist Party official of Hubei province, and Ma Guoqiang, party chief in Wuhan, followed the dismissal of two provincial health officials on Tuesday, and is part of a wider effort by Beijing to remove bureaucrats it accuses of shirking their duties.

The central government has set up a special Cabinet task force under Premier Li Keqiang to handle the crisis, and the new appointments in Hubei suggest China’s senior leaders are taking greater control.

Defending Wuhan

Reporting Mr. Ying’s appointment as the new secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the official Xinhua news agency did not explain why Mr. Jiang had been removed.

In remarks reported in the official Hubei Daily following his appointment, Mr. Ying said he would not fail the party or the people and that he bore a very heavy responsibility.

“At present, the virus situation is still extremely severe,” the paper cited him as saying.

“We will definitely win the battle to defend Wuhan, the battle to defend Hubei, and the battle to prevent and control the disease.”

Mr. Ying worked closely with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the latter’s time as party boss and Governor of Zhejiang province, which neighbours Shanghai.

Mr. Ying, in the same report in the Hubei Daily, cited Mr. Xi as saying that controlling the virus was directly related to social and economic stability and China’s opening up, and was the biggest priority at the moment.

Wuhan party chief Mr. Ma has been replaced by Wang Zhonglin, party boss of Jinan, the capital city of eastern Shandong province, Xinhua reported separately.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-hubei-chief-pledges-to-contain-virus/article30813047.ece
34,2020/02/14,"Trump’s India visit: Four Senators write to Mike Pompeo on Kashmir, CAA and NRC","The letter dated February 12 is co-signed by Democrats Chris Van Hollen and Democratic Whip Dick Durbin and Republicans Todd Young and Trump ally Lindsey Graham.

Days before U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India, four Senators, who have described themselves as “longtime friends of India”, have written to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking for an assessment of the situation in Kashmir as well as the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizenship (NRC).

The letter dated February 12 is co-signed by Democrats Chris Van Hollen (Maryland) and Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (Illinois) and Republicans Todd Young (Indiana) and Trump ally Lindsey Graham (South Carolina).

“We write as longtime friends of India regarding some of the troubling actions taken by the current government,” the Senators write. “India has now imposed the longest-ever internet shut down by a democracy, disrupting access to medical care, business, and education for seven million people. Hundreds of Kashmiris remain in ‘preventative detention’, including key political figures.”

The letter asks for an assessment in 30 days of the number of individuals detained in connection with Article 370 and “whether detainees endure torture or other forms of mistreatment”.

It also asks for an assessment of restrictions on religious freedoms and communications in Jammu and Kashmir, access to the region by independent observers, foreign journalists, foreign diplomats, consular agents and international organisations and NGOs.

Finally, the letter seeks an assessment of, “the number of individuals... at risk of statelessness, arbitrary deprivation or denial of nationality, expulsion or arbitrary detention pursuant to the Government of India’s latest National Register of Citizens list, and any excessive use of force by Indian authorities against demonstrators opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/l5ropw/article30815154.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-CHRISVANHOLLEN-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trumps-india-visit-four-senators-write-to-mike-pompeo-on-kashmir-caa-and-nrc/article30815155.ece

Armed attackers burned 21 people alive, including 16 members of the same family, in a revenge attack by criminal gangs on a village in northern Nigeria, residents said on Thursday.

Gunmen on motorcycles raided the village of Bakali in Kaduna state on Tuesday, shooting and burning homes and vehicles to avenge a raid on their hideout by local vigilantes, inhabitants said.

“They killed 21 people in the attack,” Bakali’s community leader, Sani Nuhu, told AFP.

Residents said the assailants burned alive 16 members of the same family, including six children, and five members of a local self-defence group after locking them in a house.

A police spokesman said the force had “received report of an attack by bandits on Bakali village” but was “still awaiting details”.

The area where the attack happened has in recent years been a haven for criminal gangs who steal cattle and kidnap people for ransom.

36,2020/02/14,Catch ’em young,"Secure the nation’s future by sticking to these guidelines

‘India hasn’t achieved true freedom until its nanhe munne children have been thoroughly interrogated. At least three times,’ said the Mahatma. Or Anupam Kher. Or someone.

Anyway, it was something to that effect. But that’s not the point. The point is, even if no one said it, truer words were never spoken.

We all know that the ancient future of this glorious soon-to-be $5 trillion country rests squarely in the hands of its children. And these tiny hands, as our Vedas say, happen to be controlled by highly impressionable, easily misled minds.

So what are we to do to safeguard our future?

The Karnataka police, if you ask me, have shown us the way. Before these poor children could turn into full-fledged tukde-tukde fellows who talk of reason, science and fundamental rights, they nipped the problem right in the Nehruvian rosebud. (I could be wrong, but wasn’t it Prasoon Joshi who said ‘A rose by any other name, Bharat Mata Ki Jai, is a lotus’?)

So what does this innovative, forward-thinking step by our ever-vigilant authorities teach us? What are all the other things our schoolchildren need to be interrogated about, of course.

Here is a helpful list I have prepared. After my mandatory prayers to a photograph of Arnab Goswami waving a sheaf of blank papers (taken before the evil marak shakti spell was cast on him by Kunal Kamra).

1. Using the slide in the playground

Please question small children regarding the usage of the slide. Because the ones partial to the slide could be subtly trying to imply to the world that that’s the direction our economy is headed. As we all know, that’s patently untrue. Our economy is zooming into the stratosphere like Apollo 13. If we want the children to be genuine desh bhakts, ones who will grow up to get green cards and learn mridangam via Skype, teach them to never use the slide. They could just climb the steps and stand there. Let’s build taller slides, if that’s what it takes.

2. Eating poha

Talk to the children about what they are eating for lunch. While we have already taken abundant precautions regarding the forbidden meats, there are some toxic vegetarian items, too, mind you. Poha, for instance. We all know poha is not of Indian origin. Yes, Kuchela did offer poha to Lord Krishna, and whatever is in the Mahabharata is the absolute truth (ref: Kangana Ranaut) but that poha is old, traditional, Vedic poha of Dritharashtric origin. Today’s poha is Bangladeshi. It is a no-no.

3. Green crayons

Go through the crayon boxes of the children. Check all the crayons thoroughly. But do keep your eyes peeled for the green ones and the state they are in. If they have been used more than the other colours, ha, you know where these kids belong. Book their tickets immediately. If, on the other hand, the orange one has been used more, make that kid the class monitor.

4. Hey diddle diddle

Are any of the children partial to this rhyme? It seems harmless enough, right? Wrong. Read it:

Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle / The cow jumped over the moon

The little dog laughed to see such sport / And the dish ran away with the spoon.

Can’t you see the diabolical plot of the British empire in this poem? Can you allow a dog to laugh at our gaumata? And what do they mean, the dish ran away with the spoon? A dish and a spoon are of different faiths. How dare they?

37,2020/02/14,"‘Social roots of the current protest stronger than JP movement,’ says Gyan Prakash","There are many parallels but also important differences between the current protests and the JP movement of the 70s, says this eminent historian

A historian of modern India, Gyan Prakash is the Dayton-Stockton Professor of History at Princeton University and author of the 2018 book Emergency Chronicles: Indira Gandhi and Democracy’s Turning Point. He compares the current situation in the country to the turmoil of the 70s. Excerpts:

How would you compare the current debates in India regarding state power, civil liberties and human rights with the situation in the early 70s?

There are many parallels and there are important differences too. The Emergency, although an exceptional period, was also in continuation of many of the laws that already existed, including preventive detention. The Indian state already had extraordinary powers that Indira Gandhi used. In a way, the Emergency was a sign of weakness. That was the only way she could stay in power. What is different today is that the present government can use those laws from a position of strength. It is not a position of weakness. The second difference is the social force on the ground. Though Indira Gandhi had the Youth Congress, it was not a strong social force. The present government has a substantial social force that acts in coordination with it. What happened at JNU is an example. You have people from the political organisation working with the police, which was not the case with the Emergency.

How is the social agenda of Hindutva nationalism different from the social agenda during Emergency?

Indira Gandhi faced the question of establishing a relationship between the state and the people. The JP movement brought that crisis dramatically to the forefront of national debate. One way in which she tried to solve that question was by using state power, the 20-point programme, for instance. You could see it cynically, but it was also in line with the practice of trying to enforce social change from above. But the Emergency was not able to solve it. After 1979, the relationship between the state and the people was sought to be reworked through other ideological tools. The idea of the nation was central then too — for instance, there were catchphrases such as ‘talk less, produce more’. Today, the nation is central, but it is also segmented on religious lines. The attempt is to resolve the conflict between the state and the people through Hindutva.

The use of authority in pursuit of a standardised social agenda and for the creation of a Hindu Rashtra are two fundamentally different things perhaps?

Indira Gandhi would be the last time Indians were addressed as Indians. Today, they are addressed as Indians who are Hindus. That is a different kind of politics.

Is that something that will last long and change the course of the country?

It has already changed the nature of politics. Indians are disaggregated. It started in 1979 — caste and religion. Indira Gandhi herself had started using Hindu symbols. Rajiv Gandhi opened the gates of Babri Masjid. The BJP has taken it forward. The situation has become very much like Israel’s. Being an Israeli and being a Jew have become indistinguishable. A religion-state-nation nexus has emerged and it has already changed India. In light of the current protests, you see some pushback, and the Constitution has emerged as a talisman. People may not know the details, but they are invoking Article 14, they are invoking the Preamble. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.

Do you think the Congress party can be the vehicle for protecting the idea of an inclusive India?

Well, they have not done much about it. For several years, commentators have been writing that the Congress has been unable to come up with a counter narrative. You know the BJP narrative but where is the counter narrative? Now there are counter narratives emerging from the streets. It is quite remarkable. Muslims are saying that they can be Muslims and Indians. This is an idea of a secular nation that is emerging from these protest movements. I think, what emerges from this will be very consequential if it can be sustained.

Rahul Gandhi often bears the brunt of Emergency. The BJP and PM Modi claim to be torchbearers of democracy and liberty. Is there some irony here?

It is ironic that the very people who claim to have been victims of Emergency — many of them were — are now adopting policies diametrically opposed to civil liberties, free speech and democracy. At the same time, many of the political leaders today cut their political teeth with the JP movement and emerged as leaders. It will be interesting to see what kind of leadership today’s politics throws up.

What were the motivations of the participants of the JP movement and what lessons from it are relevant today?

Just before the movement began, in 1971, all right-wing groups were defeated thoroughly by Indira Gandhi. It is a fact that the JP movement was driven by the RSS and ABVP. JP (Jayaprakash Narayan) was the face, but the organising force was RSS and ABVP and some caste leaders. They spoke of a total revolution. Their motivations were different. The current movement has no visible organisation, but it is generating its own art, poetry and literature. In the JP movement, there was nothing like that. In that sense, the present movement is more organic than the JP movement. The RSS was then waiting in the wing; since there is no political force behind the current one, what shape this will take remains an open question.

But you sound optimistic?

Yes I am. Students and youth are usually drivers of change. The constitutional patriotism that is emerging is unprecedented.

What role does caste play in such mobilisations?

In Bihar, for instance, many leaders of the JP movement belonged to OBC, including Nitish Kumar, whose father was a part of the Congress party but his growth was hindered by the caste factor. OBCs found an alternative in Lohiaite ideology. What is interesting is that JP talked about ‘total revolution’, but never about caste or upending local power structures. Never a word on land rights, etc. The current protest movement is alive to the caste question in a manner JP never was. JP was only against state socialism. Today, the younger leaders talk about Ambedkar, Dalits and the Muslim minority. The social roots and potential of this movement are far greater than the JP movement.

39,2020/02/14,LIC Housing Finance asks 14 developers to seek AIF funding,"Experiencing growth in the sector, things will improve: MD

LIC Housing Finance has advised 14 real estate developers to seek finance from the Alternative Investment Fund for last mile funding.

Last year the government has set set up a ₹25,000-crore bailout fund to finance 1,600 stalled housing projects.

The government has put in ₹10,000 crore in the alternative investment fund (AIF) while State Bank of India and Life Insurance Corporation have extended ₹15,000 crore.

“We have some eligible 14 projects for the alternate investment fund which was created last year. We have advised those developers to be in touch with SBI Caps and the process has started,” LIC Housing Finance MD & CEO Siddhartha Mohanty said at the sidelines of an event. He said the company’s exposure to these projects is about ₹1,100 crore.

“Those projects are eligible but it takes time because project completion is not an overnight job. It takes time for a lender to appraise and it is construction-linked. These projects need last-mile funding. We are experiencing some growth in the sector; the slowdown has gradually gone away and things will improve,” he added.

The home financier has developed a mobile application, in partnership with Google Cloud, to reach out to a broader set of customers with an aim to minimise the loan application process.

The application will provide instant eligibility for pre-approved home loans, based on know-your-customer and other data provided by applicants.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/lic-housing-finance-asks-14-developers-to-seek-aif-funding/article30824306.ece

Funds-starved Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd. (LVB) requires up to ₹2,000 crore to keep itself afloat, said a top executive of the bank.

“We require about ₹1,500 crore to ₹2,000 crore to improve our loan book and operations,” S. Sundar, interim managing director and CEO, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, said. “We hope we can raise the funds as we have started showing progress in our third quarter results.”

According to him, one-third of the amount would be required for working capital, provisioning and for lending. “With ₹700 crore, we can easily build our loan book to ₹7,500 crore and improve our performance. With the available funds, we can carry on for two to three years,” he said.

Mr. Sundar replied in the negative when asked if they have had any discussions with prospective investors.

On Friday, LVB constituted a team of experts, which includes Mr. Sundar, a promoter head, and non-executive director K.R. Pradeep, discuss with potential strategic investors on funds and to explore ways to bail it out.

Meanwhile, LVB’s net loss for the third quarter ended December 2019 narrowed to ₹334.48 crore from ₹373.49 crore a year earlier, on lower provisions. Cash recovery was ₹266 crore and fresh slippages was ₹256 crore.

During the quarter, LVB reported a net interest income of ₹125.91 crore against ₹138.79 crore. The provision coverage ratio rose to 68.70% (55.93%). Net interest margin improved to 1.97% from 1.65%.

The gross non-performing assets (NPA) of the bank increased to 23.27% from 13.95%, whereas net NPAs jumped to 9.81% from 7.64%. “We expect to recover at least ₹1,800 crore,” Mr. Sundar said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/lakshmi-vilas-bank-needs-up-to-2000-cr-to-stay-afloat-ceo/article30824273.ece

Chinese smartphone major Vivo has chalked out a strategy to build a long-term plan in India to be a potent player by investing in local manufacturing and retail expansion.

The company, in addition to embarking on a fresh investment plan of ₹7,500 crore in India, is laying a strong retail and servicing presence in the country with an aim to stay ahead in the race.

Exclusive stores

This year, Vivo India will set up an additional 300 exclusive stores in key markets of the country besides 20 experience centres in metros to showcase, sell and explain the benefits about its differentiated products to customers. In a sector where the stakes are very high, Vivo, in five years of entering India, has emerged as a major player due to its value-for-money products that are technologically superior, a top executive said.

“Innovation and consumer understanding has driven the growth of Vivo in India and this will remain our clear focus as we proceed,” said Nipun Marya, director, Brand Strategy, Vivo India.

He said besides providing high quality products at affordable prices and focussing on distribution, the company has ensured that customers’ complaints are addressed at company owned service centres.

While the company’s smartphones are available at 70,000 multi-brand outlets across the country, the company has opened over 350 exclusive stores in the country. This number will go up to 600 by the end of 2020, Mr. Marya said.

The company recently opened its second Experience Centre at Thane near Mumbai to showcase its futuristic technologies to its customers and provide a new and interactive environment. The first such centre was opened in Bengaluru a year ago. The company wants to open 20 such centres in metros and state capitals.

The Experience centres are one-of-a-kind retail experience for customers to experience product features in a meaningful way. Featuring an interactive touch enabled LED screen, where customers view and compare features, the flagship experience centre shall truly offer a delightful experience to the customers. It also houses dedicated Gaming, VR and Customer Interaction zones, which will allow smartphone enthusiasts to meaningfully engage with Vivo products and experience technology in an immersive environment.

“For us all customers are the same. We launch the same products both in the offline and online channel and prices are the same. We have over 600 service centres and will grow it more. We are looking for a strong foundation for Vivo to be successful in India in the long term,” he said.

When Vivo entered India it had started with a manufacturing unit at Greater Noida with a capacity of 8.4 million units annually. With the fresh investment of ₹7500 crore, it is setting up a facility to produce 25 million units annually.

44,2020/02/14,‘Overzealous interpretation of law poses risk to independent directors’,"Penalising them for a company’s action would be counter-productive: Sinha

Overzealous interpretation of the law regarding the duties and responsibilities of independent directors will make such directors risk- averse and the companies will suffer in the process, said former SEBI chairman U.K. Sinha.

‘Problem area’

“This is a problematic area... I think the balance in law is there... Unfortunately, we had some examples in the last three years where there have been overzealous interpretations. And that has led to a problem,” Mr. Sinha said on the sidelines of the CII Corporate Governance Summit.

The former SEBI chief further said that the rules clearly stated what the liabilities of an independent director were and action should be taken only if it was proved that there was an act of omission.

Penalising independent directors for the company’s action about which the director had no knowledge would be counter-productive, he said. This assumes significance as there had been a few instances wherein even warrants had been issued against independent directors for decisions taken by the board at a time when the director was not even on the board of the company.

HDFC chief executive officer Keki Mistry, while speaking at the event, said that independent directors needed some amount of immunity and should not be held accountable for the company’s actions that are beyond the control of such directors.

“Some immunity and protection should be given to independent directors,” Mr. Mistry said.

Further, he spoke about the increasing influence of shareholder activism, which at times, he said, even tried to influence board decisions.

He highlighted a few instances wherein such activists objected to the directorship of long-serving individuals, including founders, on the board of the company.

Whistle-blowers

While stressing that genuine whistle-blowers needed to be rewarded and protected, he said that those who tried to misuse the system should be “penalised”.

Mr. Mistry also highlighted the role of proxy advisory firms, which, according to him, would become more ‘pronounced’ in the coming days making companies more careful in terms of corporate governance.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rg5cxn/article30824200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THBUSINHA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/overzealous-interpretation-of-law-poses-risk-to-independent-directors/article30824201.ece
45,2020/02/14,Textile policy to be rolled out by mid 2020,"Mega parks will help country scale, spurring cost effectiveness: Textiles Secretary

The Central Government is expected to roll out a Textile Policy by the middle of this year, according to Ravi Capoor, Secretary of the Union Ministry of Textiles.

“We are working on a policy. Two rounds of consultatations have been held with the stakeholders. Hopefully by mid-year we should have the new policy,” Mr. Capoor told The Hindu on Thursday.

On the measures to be taken to attract investments in textiles and clothing, he said the need for cost effectiveness is a major challenge.

One factor affecting cost effectiveness is lack of scale. “New industries should look at scale. The Ministry plans to develop 10 mega textile parks. Each one will be an integrated park. We hope to bring some economies of scale with this. India should be a destination for Foreign Direct Investment in textiles. We need good infrastructure for it.” The Ministry is talking to the States and a meeting will be held on Monday too. Any State which has minimum 1,000 acres ready for the park will be supported to develop it, he said.

The Secretary was hopeful of textile and garment exports increasing this financial year compared to last year, when it was roughly $38 billion. Indian exporters are largely cotton based. “We should move to MMF (manmade fibre). If Indian exports in MMF grow to the level of cotton (ie, the share of Indian cotton product exports in global trade) the overall exports will increase by $20-25 billion,” he said.

Another thrust area will be technical textiles. The Cabinet is expected to approve the National Technical Textiles Mission, announced in the Budget, soon. It will be rolled out in a couple of months. “We are going to spend ₹1,000 crore in developing raw materials for technical textiles; research associations will be asked to produce applications for these.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/y8fta1/article30824181.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THBUTEXTILES,https://www.thehindu.com/business/textile-policy-to-be-rolled-out-by-mid-2020/article30824182.ece

In a relief to e-commerce majors Amazon and Flipkart, the Karnataka High Court on Friday stayed the Competition Commission of India’s order directing an investigation through its Director General into whether they had entered into anti-competitive agreements in violation of the provisions of the Competition Act 2002.

Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar passed the interim order while admitting a petition filed by Amazon Seller Services Pvt. Ltd., and stayed the January 13 order of the CCI. The CCI had ordered the probe on a complaint by Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh (DVM), which had alleged that Amazon and Flipkart were giving preference to select sellers and offering deep discounts by indulging in anti-competitive agreements.

The High Court passed the interim order after noticing that the central government, on a petition filed by Telecom Watchdog (an NGO) in March 2019, had told the Delhi High Court that an investigation under the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999, was initiated against Amazon and Flipkart to ascertain whether they were contravening any provisions or rule, regulations, notification, direction or order issued in exercise of the powers under FEMA, or contravening any condition subject to which an authorisation was issued by the Reserve Bank of India, etc., and that an investigation was in progress.

Noting that the Foreign Direct Investment policy prohibits an investor from indulging in deep discounts, giving preference to sellers, etc., on online marketplace, and that the Centre had initiated a probe under FEMA to ascertain whether allegation of violation of conditions are true, the court said the complaint by DVM before too are on same issue.

The CCI, the court said, had not properly deliberated the issues to come to a conclusion that there exists a case to conduct an investigation as the CCI had concluded there was possibility of an exclusive partnership between smartphone makers and e-commerce platforms though the agreements cited in the complaint were between the online platforms and the sellers.

The court also observed that the DVM’s complaint had contained an earlier order — passed by the CCI on a complaint of anti-competitive practice made against Flipkart by the All India Online Vendors Association (AIOVA) — in which the CCI gave a decision that was in favour of Flipkart and Amazon, though the latter was not a party, but was invited by the CCI to give details of its business practices. However, in the present case, the CCI did not discuss its order in the AVIOVA case, the court said.

The court, while relying on the apex court’s verdicts, did not accept the arguments — canvassed on behalf of the DVM, the Confederation of All India Traders and the CCI — that the writ petition is not maintainable.

Ltd. has supported Amazon’s contentions though it has not filed a separate petition.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/pdino/article30824144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THBUFLIPKART,https://www.thehindu.com/business/karnataka-hc-stays-cci-order-against-amazon-flipkart/article30824145.ece

48,2020/02/14,SC refuses to extend BS-IV deadline,"The Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a plea by automobile dealers for permission to sell and register vehicles following the Bharat Stage-IV standard emission norms beyond April 1, 2020.

The court had, in 2018, banned the sale and registration of these vehicles beyond this cut-off date. The plea filed by the automobile dealers, which came up before a Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta, sought an extension of a month because they were staring at the prospect of unsold inventory. “There is a slowdown... Kindly allow us to sell BS-IV vehicles to clear stock,” they argued.

The Bench pointed out that the cut-off date was passed in an order in 2018.

“You should not have produced BS-IV vehicles after that. Even after filing this application, you have produced these vehicles,” the court responded.

When the association’s counsel urged the court that their application was like a “mercy plea”, the bench said, “No”.

On October 24, 2018, a three-judge Bench led by Justice (now retired) Madan B. Lokur had concluded that pollution levels have reached an “alarming and critical” level all over India.

Bharat Stage (BS) emission norms are standards instituted by the government to regulate output of air pollutants from motor vehicles.

Low-cost carrier SpiceJet has received an ‘interim offer of compensation’ from Boeing for the grounding of its 13 Boeing 737 MAX planes following a global ban on the aircraft, the airline said on Friday.

The airline had drawn up a claim of ₹537 crore since the grounding of the aircraft in March 2019. The claim is for expenses incurred on lease rentals and ‘other identified expenses relating to the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft’. The update on the status of compensation was part of the airline’s financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.

“Based on current stage of discussions with, and considering the interim offer of compensation received from, the aircraft manufacturer, its own assessment and legal advice obtained by the company, management is confident of collection of the above income recognised by the company,” as per the carrier’s comments on the financial statement.

In a statement, the carrier said it had recorded a 33% rise in profit to ₹73.2 crore. “Had the company not recognised such other income, the reported profit for the quarter would have been a loss of ₹1,73.195 crore,” said the independent auditor’s review report made to the board, referring to the compensation claim the airline expects to make to Boeing.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/spicejet-gets-interim-offer-from-boeing/article30824006.ece

India has offered to partially open up its poultry and dairy markets in a bid for a limited trade deal during U.S. President Donald Trump's first official visit to the country this month, people familiar with the protracted talks say.

India, the world's largest milk-producing nation, has traditionally restricted dairy imports to protect the livelihoods of 80 million rural households involved in the industry.

Also Read Walls rise in Ahmedabad ahead of Donald Trump visit

But Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to pull all the stops for the U.S. president's Feb. 24-25 visit, aimed at rebuilding bonds between the world's largest democracies. In 2019, Trump suspended India's special trade designation that dated back to 1970s, after Modi put price caps on medical devices, such as cardiac stents and knee implants, and introduced new data localization requirements and e-commerce restrictions.

Trump's trip to India has raised hopes that he would restore some of the country's U.S. trade preferences, in exchange for tariff reductions and other concessions.

The United States is India's second-largest trade partner after China, and bilateral goods and services trade climbed to a record $142.6 billion in 2018. The United States had a $23.2 billion goods trade deficit in 2019 with India, its 9th largest trading partner in goods.

India has offered to allow imports of U.S. chicken legs, turkey and produce such as blueberries and cherries, Indian government sources said, and has offered to cut tariffs on chicken legs from 100% to 25%. U.S. negotiators want that tariff cut to 10%.

The Modi government is also offering to allow some access to India's dairy market, but with a 5% tariff and quotas, the sources said. But dairy imports would need a certificate they are not derived from animals that have consumed feeds that include internal organs, blood meal or tissues of ruminants.

New Delhi has also offered to lower its 50% tariffs on very large motorcycles made by Harley-Davidson, a tax that was a particular irritant for Trump, who has labeled India the “tariff king.” The change would be largely symbolic because few such motorcycles are sold in India.

Trump will be feted in Modi's home state of Gujarat, then hold talks in New Delhi and attend a reception that the hosts have promised will be bigger than the one organized for former president Barack Obama in 2015.

ENOUGH FOR LIGHTHIZER?

But it is far from clear whether India's offers will be enough to satisfy U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who cancelled plans for a trip to India this week. Instead, he has held telephone talks with Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal.

The U.S. dairy industry remained skeptical on Thursday that a viable deal is at hand.

“We're always looking for market access, but in terms of India, as of today I'm not aware of any real progress going on,” said Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association and a member of USTR's agricultural trade policy advisory committee.

Dykes said the U.S. dairy industry was looking for access in viable commercial quantities.

A USTR spokesman and India's trade ministry did not respond to requests for comment.

PRIVACY LAW COMPLICATIONS

An Indian parliament panel is reviewing a draft data privacy law that imposes stringent controls over cross-border data flows and gives the government powers to seek user data from companies.

It is not clear whether it will be passed, or in what form, but the possibilities have unnerved U.S. companies and could raise compliance requirements for Google, Amazon.com Inc, and Facebook.

The draft law is not part of the trade discussions, Indian officials say, because the issue is too difficult to resolve at the same time.

“The privacy and localization piece will be raised independently and in concert with the trade discussions,” said a Washington-based source with knowledge of the U.S. administration's thinking.

Trump on Tuesday was non-committal about sealing a trade deal before his visit. “If we can make the right deal, we'll do it,” he told reporters.

Two U.S. sources said progress had been made on proposed alterations to the medical device price caps. India's new import tariffs on medical devices, walnuts, toys, electronics and other products on Feb. 1 surprised U.S. negotiators, however.

The new tariffs were aimed at China, which also makes medical devices, according to an Indian government source. “We have to protect our market and our companies,” the source said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/iq6d5b/article30780740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th21BUINDOUS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/india-offers-us-dairy-chicken-access-in-bid-for-elusive-trade-deal-with-trump/article30817576.ece

Starting with the next meeting of the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), procurement cases will be put up as prioritised by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Major General Mukesh Agarwal, Defence Adviser to General Bipin Rawat said on Friday.

Also, a proposal has been sent to the Defence Ministry on a formal structure comprising civil and military officials for the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) headed by the CDS.

“At present, we have an interim structure. The approval has not come, so they have no financial powers. All files related to financial approvals are coming to the Secretary, DMA,” Major Gen. Agarwal said, adding, “We made a much leaner organisation as we have domain specialists.” It has been agreed to in-principle but the approvals will take some time, he stated.

In addition to the CDS at the helm, the proposed DMA will have a Secretary, Transformation and Coordination, which will be the Chief of Integrated Defence Staff (IDS), an Additional Secretary and five Joint Secretaries. The Additional Secretary will be a three-star officer while the Joint Secretaries include three officers, one from each service of the rank of Major General or equivalent.

On streamlining procurements, Major Gen. Agarwal said technology on the battlefield is very dynamic and procurements have to be prioritised.

All revenue procurements are totally with the DMA and financial powers of Defence Secretary will now go to the Secretary, DMA. In addition, while capital procurements remain with the Department of Defence (DoD) headed by the Defence Secretary, Major Gen. Agarwal said, “Prioritisation of all capital procurement remains with DMA.”

He said they had studied various models including the Ministry of External Affairs, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Defence Research and Development Organisation before arriving at a suitable model. The proposed model is also an interim one and would be reviewed.

The IDS headquarters will remain as it is, Major Gen. Agarwal said, adding that the role of the DMA is scrutiny and the role of the IDS is “jointness”. Military diplomacy has been moved to the DMA, while defence diplomacy remains with the DoD.

On December 30, the Centre notified the creation of the DMA with the CDS as its head and also as a Secretary in the MoD.

Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap on Friday expressed his solidarity with anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters outside Jamia Millia Islamia and assured them that they were not alone in their struggle and asked them to have patience as it was going to be a long fight.

“When the CAA was passed, I used to believe that we are finished and dead... but coming here today I’m convinced that we are alive,” Mr. Kashyap said, adding that the fight was to “take the Constitution, country and everything back”.

“Everyday I read stories and watch videos about you people. This gives me strength. What is happening gives us the understanding and strength that we have an existence,” he added.

Standing atop a table, he addressed the gathering and said that what we needed today was transparency. “A government that says different things each time can no longer be believed for its saying but only by its actions,” he said.

Mr. Kashyap said he had left Twitter but reopened the account in December after the police allegedly attacked students and entered the Jamia campus. “I had left everything and went away but I changed my mind after seeing what happened in Jamia in December. I saw a video of a girl and that gave me the courage to return to Twitter. Now I will not stay silent,” he said.

‘Protest must go on’

He added that no matter what happens, a non violent protest should continue till its aims are won.

“This government knows how to deal with violence, but would always be trumped by peace, love and empathy,” he said.

After his Jamia visit, he went to Shaheen Bagh and met the famed Dadis of the protest and also relished some biryani — the famous dish that has become a subject of contention between those in favour of and opposed to the CAA and NRC across the country.

Mr. Kashyap took to the stage and asked protesters to not give any reason to those in power to evacuate them from the site.

“When you fight for your rights, it is important that you stick with your truth. Don’t give them any chance that they can violently remove you from here They do not understand the language of love. This is the only way to fight with them because they themselves do not know what they want,” he said.

Potshots at Shah

He also took potshots at Home Minister Amit Shah during his speech, saying he personally would not believe whatever the government claimed about the CAA.

“If we are misinformed, come and explain it to us,” Kashyap said, hailing the protesters for continuing the demonstration which started on December 15.

Buoyed by its massive victory in the Delhi assembly polls, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has decided to contest all elections to local bodies across the country as part of an ambitious plan to expand its footprint beyond the national capital.

Senior AAP leader Gopal Rai said the party has convened a meeting of its national executive on Sunday to deliberate on expanding the party by projecting its “positive nationalism”.

Mr. Rai, a confidante of AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal, said the party has set its sight on contesting assembly elections in a number of states including Punjab in the first phase.

“The agenda of Sunday’s meeting is to expand our organisation at the national level by including volunteers in large numbers and building party cadre across the country,” he said.

Mr. Rai, a Minister in outgoing Kejriwal government, said people will be able to join AAP’s ‘nation building campaign’ by giving a missed call on the phone number — 9871010101.

“We will reach out to people through this campaign and make them volunteers in large numbers. The party will contest elections of all local bodies across the country. AAP will fight upcoming local bodies elections in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat,” he said.

Mr. Rai called BJP’s nationalism “negative”, asserting that AAP will expand its base by highlighting on “positive nationalism“.

“In Delhi, we spread positive nationalism which is based on love and respect. The BJP’s nationalism is based on hatred and divisive politics,” he said.

“The experiment done by the AAP in Delhi has become a role model for the entire country. Our nationalism is positive nationalism which gives guarantee of good education, health care and livelihood to every section of the society including farmers,” he said.

On beng asked about BJP’s attack on Mr. Kejriwal for reciting Hanuman Chalisa on a TV channel in the run up to the assembly elections, Mr. Rai said for the Bhartiya Janata Party, religion is a “political weapon”, but for the people of the country, religion is a belief.

“The BJP does not respect people of India and it sees every person as its vote bank,” he said.

57,2020/02/14,SC rejects Nirbhaya convict’s plea against President’s decision,"Vinay Sharma had challenged the rejection of his mercy plea

The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a petition filed by Nirbhaya case convict Vinay Sharma challenging the rejection of his mercy plea by the President.

A three-judge Bench led by Justice R. Banumathi, in a 26-page judgment, found no merit in Sharma’s contention that the mercy plea was rejected because of non-application of mind.

Justice Banumathi, who wrote the judgment, rejected all the grounds raised by Sharma, including non-furnishing of relevant official records and documents concerning the mercy petition in response to an RTI request filed by the condemned man’s lawyers.

Sharma had pleaded mental illness caused by “inhuman torture” behind bars. The petition had said he had caused self-harm on many occasions. It was submitted that his medical records and the status report on the mental health were placed before the President.

However, the apex court consulted the documents and concluded that the “petitioner is psychologically well adjusted”. It referred to medical experts’ view that “he was provided with regular therapy sessions by specialised therapists and the general condition of the petitioner is stable”.

The court also trashed allegations of bias caused to the case of the petitioner because of the statements made by ministers in the Delhi government and the Centre, which “led to pre-judging the outcome of the petitioner’s mercy petition even before it was placed before the President for consideration”.

“The public statements said to have been made by the Ministers cannot be said to have any bearing on the ‘aid and advice’ tendered by the Council of Ministers of Delhi to the Lieutenant Governor or by Council of Ministers in the Central Government to the President,” the court held.

62,2020/02/14,"Central Vista project will roll on, says Puri","Delhi HC has taken cognisance of 2 petitions challenging DDA’s proposed change of land-use

The government would not allow the Central Vista redevelopment project to get “derailed”, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Friday when asked about challenges filed in the Delhi High Court against land-use change for the project.

The Delhi High Court has taken cognisance of two petitions challenging the Delhi Development Authority’s proposed change of land-use for several plots along the 3-km Central Vista.

“It’s up to the petitioners to file petitions. There has been total transparency. Bimal Patel [architect working on the project] has met all town planners. This is a project that is evolving...With the amount of consultations we have done, we are not going to allow the project to be derailed,” Mr. Puri said in response to a question by The Hindu at a press conference.

The government is planning to construct a new Parliament building, new residences for the Vice-President and Prime Minister, a new Prime Minister’s Office and office buildings for all Ministries. The DDA had notified its proposed land-use change on December 21, 2019 and asked for comments, objections and suggestions for one month, after which it held public hearings on February 6 and 7. Among the concerns raised was that the DDA gave only a day’s notice for those with objections to attend the hearings.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vpkwpl/article30820395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HardeepSinghPuri,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/central-vista-project-will-roll-on-says-puri/article30820316.ece
63,2020/02/14,Justice Dharmadhikari of Bombay HC resigns citing personal reasons,"He has been constantly expressing his displeasure on the pace of the probe by the CBI and SIT into killing of rationalist Govind Pansare and Narendra Dabholkar.

In a shocking move, Justice Satyaranjan C Dharmadhikari, the most senior judge after the Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court, told an advocate appearing before him on Friday that he had demitted his office, and that he had resigned.

Advocate Mathews Nedumpara told The Hindu that when he was mentioning a matter before Justice Dharmadhikari in the morning, the latter said, “I cannot grant you any relief as today is my last day”. Mr. Nedumpara asked, “Is your lordship being elevated?”. Justice Dharmadhikari then said, “I am demitting my office”.

He later told journalists in his chamber that his resignation was because of ‘family reasons and purely personal’.

When asked about him being elevated as the Chief Justice of the Orissa High Court and that the discussion had started in 2019, he said certain developments happened in between, which were not known to him, because of which he was left with an option either to shift to Odisha or resign, and that he was reluctant to move to Odisha because of the short tenure.

Another scenario

In an another scenario, Justice Dharmadhikari would have been the acting Chief Justice after current Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog retires on February 24, 2020. His father, the late Chandrashekar Dharmadhikari, had held the Chief Justice post.

Justice Dharmadhikari, who did not want to move out of Mumbai for personal reasons, said he hoped to be in the city but that Mumbai was not an option. He said that while he did not mind the expectations and the work pressure, he felt bad when the expectations were not fulfilled.

He said, “My hope is that the Bombay High Court remains the same. It stands for the persons who have suffered injustice. It should continue to serve their cause. Hope this institution does not bend before the mighty state, the biggest litigant before it.”

Born in 1960 to a family a lawyers, Justice Dharmadhikari started his practice as an advocate in June 1983 and later went on practice on the original and appellate side of the Bombay High Court. He was due to retire in January 2022.

He was elevated as a judge of the High Court on November 14, 2003. He has passed several strictures against government officers. He has been constantly expressing his displeasure over the pace of the probe conducted by the CBI and SIT (Special Investigation Team) into the killing of rationalists Govind Pansare and Dr. Narendra Dabholkar.

Recently, he came down heavily on the Principal Secretary of the Tribal Development Department for not taking any action against 123 officers, who allegedly misappropriated funds allotted for the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes people.

Justice Dharmadhikari was associated with the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa as a member of the disciplinary committee, and as the member of the managing committee of the High Court library for several years.

‘Gandhi did not need to file a PIL’

Justice S.C. Dharmadhikari of the Mumbai High Court, who put in his papers on Friday in an unexpected decision, had passed several strictures against government officers during tenure. Notably he expressed his displeasure repeatedly over the slow pace of the probe conducted by the CBI and SIT (Special Investigation Team) into the killing of rationalists Govind Pansare and Dr. Narendra Dabholkar.

Recently, he came down heavily on the Principal Secretary of the Tribal Development Department for not taking any action against 123 officers, who allegedly misappropriated funds allotted for the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes.

Talking to the reporters in his chambers on Friday, Justice Dharmadhikari said executive inaction leads to pressure on the judiciary.

Referring to the good old days, he said Mahatma Gandhi never needed to file a PIL but today the public at large come to courts seeking some sort of relief because government officials don't do their work and this never happened before. He said he over dependency on judiciary is not good for any country.

On his retirement he said, ""there comes a time when a person must listen to his family and his body.""

He concluded by saying, “I am fully satisfied with 16 years of my service here and will now work in the field of consultancy.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bg36q6/article30823925.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dharmadhikari,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/justice-dharmadhikari-of-bombay-hc-resigns-citing-personal-reasons/article30820193.ece
64,2020/02/14,SC seeks J&K govt.’s response to plea against Omar Abdullah’s detention under Public Safety Act,"The former Chief Minister’s sister says his life and liberty are at threat

The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Jammu and Kashmir government to respond to a petition filed by Sara Abdullah Pilot against the detention of her brother and former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah under the Public Safety Act.

A Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Indira Banerjee then listed the case for hearing next on March 2.

The court refused to heed to fervent pleas made by Ms. Pilot’s lawyer and senior advocate Kapil Sibal to list the case next week.

“No. Next on March 2. It cannot be next week. You have waited for so long to file this petition...” Justice Mishra said categorically.

“He (Omar) was under detention for the past six months... This is someone else, his sister, who has come,” Mr. Sibal replied.

Justice Mishra persisted that if the petition had been filed so late, it could wait for another 15 days (till March 2) for a hearing.

Also read | In Kashmir, abnormal is the new normal

Mr. Sibal clarified that there had been no delay. This petition challenged his fresh detention under the PSA and not his past six-month confinement under Section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, he submitted.

“This is the PSA. This is a habeas corpus. Please list the case next week. It is the law... This is a matter of personal liberty,” Mr. Sibal

The court refused to bend. “No, not next week,” Justice Mishra said.

Ms. Pilot has urged for issuance of a writ of habeas corpus for authorities to forthwith produce Mr. Abdullah before the Supreme Court and set him at liberty.

Ms. Pilot, also represented by senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, has said she was gravely concerned about the welfare, safety and security of her brother. He was already under detention from August 5 last year — the day the Centre removed the special rights of the Kashmiri people under Article 370 — when the PSA was slapped on him on February 5, 2020.

Ms. Pilot said she was shocked to learn that, just like what happened to their father, the government had imposed a fresh lease of detention under the PSA on her brother too.

The petition explained that Mr. Abdullah’s detention from August 5 under Section 107 CrPC (security for keeping the peace) was scheduled to end on February 5, 2020. His release was imminent. He had served the maximum period of detention.

On February 5, the Executive Magistrate, instead of releasing him, ordered his further detention under Section 8 of the Public Safety Act of 1978 in an “arbitrary exercise of power”.

In fact, she said that during the past six months there had been no effort by authorities to verify the truth behind the “information” that Mr. Abdullah was a threat to peace. In fact, on the other hand, there were reams of material in the form of tweets and public statements vouching for his exemplary conduct to maintain peace.

Ms. Pilot urged there was danger to her brother’s life and liberty.

The petition said the government, in its PSA dossier against charging Mr. Abdullah, had described him as a threat to public safety. It said he was “planning activities against the Union government”. It also highlighted “his popularity and potential to draw voters to polling booths”.

It argued that the detention order was illegal as it conflated ‘governmental policy’ with the ‘Indian State’, suggesting that any opposition to the former constituted a threat to the latter.

“This is wholly antithetical to a democratic polity and undermines the Constitution,” the petition added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/drtkot/article30820025.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OMARABDULLAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-seeks-jk-govts-response-to-plea-against-omar-abdullahs-detention-under-public-safety-act/article30819867.ece

67,2020/02/14,Supreme Court disposes of DMK’s appeal on disqualification of 11 AIADMK MLAs,"T.N. Advocate General informs court that Speaker has issued notice

The Supreme Court disposed of an appeal filed by the DMK on the disqualification of 11 AIADMK MLAs for voting against Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palanisamy in a confidence motion in 2017 after the State’s Advocate General informed the court on Friday that the Assembly Speaker has issued notice in the disqualification proceedings.

Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde refused to put the Speaker on a deadline.

“Needless to mention the Speaker had to take a decision in accordance with the law,” Chief Justice Bobde observed in the short order closing the case.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal once again referred to a January 21 judgment by a Supreme Court Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, which required Speakers of Lok Sabha and State Assemblies to decide disqualification petitions within a “reasonable period” of maximum three months. This judgment had also urged Parliament to amend the Constitution to strip Speakers, who may be biased by their respective political ideology, of their power to decide disqualification pleas under the Tenth Schedule and hand it over to an independent tribunal to decide fairly and impartially.

Mr. Sibal appears for DMK leader R. Sakkarapani, who has appealed an April 2018 order of the Madras High Court.

In its 57-page order, the High Court had held that it could not, merely on the basis of a writ petition under Article 226, encroach on the Speaker’s powers under the Tenth Schedule. The court had further refrained from passing any orders on the prayer made by Mr. Sakkarapani to issue a mandamus to the Speaker to disqualify the 11 AIADMK legislators under the anti-defection law.

Mr. Sakkarapani’s petition had said 11 MLAs from the Panneerselvam faction voted against the trust vote on February 18, 2017. The plea for their disqualification was made before the Speaker under Paragraph 2 (1)(b) of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/plskny/article19712197.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dhanapal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-disposes-of-dmks-appeal-on-disqualification-of-11-aiadmk-mlas/article30819085.ece

Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM), the outfit behind the Pulwama terror attack that left 40 CRPF jawans dead this day last year, “stands decimated”, a top CRPF official on Friday said, even as a memorial was inaugurated and floral tributes were paid to the deceased jawans in a low-key ceremony in Lethpora.

“We took JeM head on soon after the Lethpora attack. All the JeM men, including its top commanders involved in the attack, were killed in concerted operations. Today, it stands decimated,” Additional Director General, CRPF, Zulfikar Hassan, said.

Also read | Pulwama terror attack: Even after a year, NIA unable to trace source of explosives

On the progress in the investigation, he said, “The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is investigating the attack. It has made huge progress in the case”.

According to official data, 38 members of the JeM, including nine commanders, were killed after the Pulwama attack.

The outfit's move to gather muscle to carry out more attacks were blunted with the killing of commander Qari Yasir and Moosa alias Abu Usmaan from Pakistan in an encounter in Hasipora Tral in Pulwama on January 25 this year.

“Yasir did pose a potential threat. His killing has brought down the recruitment of locals and the outfit's striking capability”, said a top counter-insurgency police officer.

The official data suggest that at least 10 JeM supporters were arrested this year, mostly in Awantipora-Pulwama axis, which remains the hub of the outfit for many years now.

JeM’s local suicide bomber, Adil Dar, detonated an explosives-laden car near a CRPF convoy on the Srinagar-Jammu national highway. India launched air strikes inside Pakistan in response to the attack and hit several militants camps later in February last year.

Tributes paid

Senior officials of all the wings of the security forces — including the Army, the J&K police and the CRPF — laid wreaths at the memorial to pay tributes to the jawans. Their names, ranks and battalions were displayed on the occasion.

Umesh Gopinath Jadhav from Maharashtra was the special guest at the wreath-laying ceremony. He had travelled around 61,000 km to meet the families of the jawans and collected soil from their lawns.

“The soil collected from the homes of all the 40 bravehearts was presented to the CRPF and hopefully will be part of the memorial. This is a little contribution that makes me feel proud today,” he said.

Paying his tributes, J&K Lieutenant Governor Girish Chandra Murmu said, “The country is indebted to all these martyrs and will always remember their valour and sacrifice”.

73,2020/02/14,SC hauls up telcos for not paying AGR dues,"Apex court also issues notice to DoT for letter ‘staying’ judgment

The Supreme Court on Friday ordered the managing directors and directors of companies, including telecom majors Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, to show cause why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against them for failing to pay even a “single penny” to the government in Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues, worth ₹1.47 lakh crore, despite an October 2019 judgment.

A three-judge Bench, led by Justice Arun Mishra, called the non-compliance with the judgment a “very disturbing scenario”. It also drew contempt proceedings against a Department of Telecom (DoT) officer responsible for issuing an order to the Accountant General, a constitutional authority, on January 23, 2020, to desist from taking any coercive action against the defaulting companies.

Following the strictures, the DoT began issuing notices to the telcos to pay the AGR dues as early as midnight of February 14 (Friday).

Failure to comply with the orders would entail company heads appearing in person in court at the next hearing on March 17, the court said.

Also Read Why is the telecom sector under stress?

The court recorded in the order that the DoT’s January 23 order was “nothing but a device to scuttle the order of this court”. The October 2019 judgment had given the companies three months to pay their dues in AGR. The DoT officer concerned has been asked to file a reply to the contempt notice.

“Let us wind up the Supreme Court then... There is no law left in the country. We are anguished. I feel I should not work in this system. Who is behind all this nonsense? How can a mere desk officer in your department defy a Supreme Court judgment by ordering that they need not pay and no coercive action will be taken... Does he think he is the Supreme Court? How can he literally stay an Supreme Court judgment? What temerity is this? Have you [government] even questioned him once for this?” Justice Mishra lashed out at the DoT, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.

“This desk officer behind this nonsense [January 23 letter]... does he think he is the Supreme Court? This is pure contempt. A 100% contempt! If your desk officer does not withdraw this letter within the next one hour or 30 minutes, he will go to jail today itself. Withdraw this [letter] immediately... We want him here,” a visibly angry Justice Mishra orally addressed Mr. Mehta initially in the hearing.

When Mr. Mehta urged the Bench to defer the hearing and not make any insinuations that the DoT acted “hand in glove” with the defaulting companies, Justice Mishra shot back, saying: “Do not saying anything more or you yourself will be in the frame. Do not take this lightly. There is no respect for the judicial system”.

Mr. Mehta tried to pacify the judge, saying “We all know about Your Lordship’s benevolence...”

Justice Mishra responded sharply, “No, you don’t know me even an inch and we don’t want respect from anybody in this world... I am not bothered about it myself... In fact, it is better not to live in this country, better to leave this country. This desk officer is writing constitutional authorities... He grants a stay... The judicial system of this country has been taken away”.

Justice Mishra turned to senior advocate Fali Nariman, appearing for Vodafone, saying “Companies have not deposited any money... have no respect for the direction of this court”. The court rejected Mr. Nariman’s offer to make an immediate part payment in dues.

“Ensure that they pay up by the next hearing,” Justice Mishra orally addressed Mr. Nariman.

Modification plea

The sharp observations came while hearing applications filed by the companies for a modification of the October 2019 judgment to pay dues to the government within three months.

Public sector units Oil India, GAIL, Rail Tel and Power Grid Corporation chose to withdraw their applications against the judgment.

The Bench, also comprising Justices Abdul Nazeer and M.R. Shah, on January 16 dismissed the review petitions filed by the companies against the October verdict for lack of merit.

The companies had sought the court’s intervention, saying the October direction would spell huge ramifications in the telecom industry and “severely hamper” programmes like Digital India, Make in India and Skill India.

Vodafone had urged the court to alter its order and permit it to submit an application before the DoT for drawing up a schedule for payment of the dues.

Bharti had said the exercise for calculating the amounts due, including past demands, were continuing and would require further interaction with the government as it covered licences across 22 circles and a period of over 15 years. Besides, it said all the parties would take time to “reconcile” with the calculations.

They had argued that the October last judgment's schedule for AGR payment may risk large-scale job losses, destruction of billions of USD of capital investments due to bankruptcies and poor financial health, large scale NPAs (Non-Performing Assets).",national,https://www.thehindu.com/business/4zu0ts/article17384349.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/telecom,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-takes-strong-note-of-non-compliance-of-its-order-asking-telcos-to-pay-147-lakh-crore/article30817940.ece

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday informed a city court that its money laundering probe in the Aircel-Maxis case was under way, while the CBI said responses to the Letters Rogatory (judicial requests) sent to Malaysia were awaited.

Both the probe agencies filed status reports of their investigation, in a sealed cover, as sought by the court.

The District and Sessions court marked both the ED and CBI cases to Additional Sessions Judge Ajay Kuhar. The matter has been listed for hearing on February 20.

Last month, the court revived the cases that were earlier adjourned sine die by then Special Judge O.P. Saini in September last, observing that the two agencies were seeking adjournment after adjournment.

Last year, the court granted bail to former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and his son Karti Chidambaram in the CBI and ED cases. They have refuted all the charges against them.

The probe agencies are probing the alleged irregularities in FIPB (Foreign Investment Promotion Board) clearance to the Aircel-Maxis deal during Mr. Chidambaram's tenure.

76,2020/02/14,"Who gained from Pulwama attack, asks Rahul","A year after the Pulwama terror attack, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday questioned the Union government on accountability for the security lapse and the findings of the inquiry that was meant to probe the attack.

While paying homage to the jawans of the jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) killed in the attack, Mr. Gandhi asked who ‘gained’ from it.

“Today as we remember our 40 CRPF martyrs in the #PulwamaAttack , let us ask: 1. Who benefitted the most from the attack? 2. What is the outcome of the inquiry into the attack? 3. Who in the BJP Govt has yet been held accountable for the security lapses that allowed the attack?” he said on Twitter.

Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala, who held a press conference almost immediately after the attack to raise the issue of intelligence failure of an impending attack, was asked to tone down his criticism as the party had resorted to a self-imposed 10-day gag on targeting the government.

In a fresh attack, apart from the alleged security lapse, Mr Surjewala asked the role of Deputy Superintendent of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) police Davinder Singh, who was recently arrested for his militant links as the officer posted in Pulwama at the time of the attack.

“Entire Nation pays homage to martyrs of #Pulwama ! Questions remain-: 1. Why is the report of Pulwama attack not being made public? 2. Who is accountable? 3. Who brought the 350 Kgs Improvised Explosive Device? 4. Why were intelligence reports of attack ignored? 5. Did Devinder Singh have any role?” asked Mr. Surjewala.

At a press conference in the Congress headquarters, party spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill alleged that the BJP was more bothered about ‘vote security’ than ‘national security’ and had not bothered to help the families of the victims despite Bharat Ka Veer fund -- to help the families of paramilitary personnel – seeing its corpus go up to Rs. 250 crore post the attack.

Responding to the BJP’s attack on Mr. Gandhi’s tweet, Mr. Shergil said, “When Shri Narendra Modi held a press conference questioning the government from attack site of 26/11, he was a nationalist, but when Shri Rahul Gandhi raises questions on Pulwama he is anti-national?

77,2020/02/14,"Pulwama attack anniversary: Congress leader insulting the memory of dead soldiers, says BJP","The BJP took umbrage at the remarks of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. It said Mr. Gandhi was insulting the memory of the soldiers.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to the 40 CRPF soldiers killed in a terror attack on their convoy in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir a year ago, even as the anniversary was at the centre of a war of words between the BJP and the Opposition.

“India will never forget the martyrdom of the security personnel killed in last year’s Pulwama attack,” Mr. Modi wrote on Twitter, terming the slain soldiers “exceptional individuals” who devoted their lives to serving and protecting the nation. “Tributes to the brave martyrs who lost their lives in the gruesome Pulwama attack last year. They were exceptional individuals who devoted their lives to serving and protecting our nation. India will never forget their martyrdom,” he said.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also paid tributes to the jawans. He tweeted: “Remembering the fallen CRPF personnel who were martyred during the dastardly attack in Pulwama (Jammu and Kashmir) on this day in 2019. India will never forget their sacrifice.” Mr. Singh, who was the Union Home Minister at the time of the attack, said the whole country was committed to continuing the fight against terrorism.

The BJP took umbrage at the remarks of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. He tweeted that a year after the incident, it was important to ask questions: “...1. Who benefitted the most from the attack? 2. What is the outcome of the inquiry into the attack? 3. Who in the BJP Govt has yet been held accountable for the security lapses that allowed the attack?”

The BJP said Mr. Gandhi was insulting the memory of the soldiers. Party spokesperson G.V.L. Narasimha Rao said it was a “shame” that such remarks were being made “when the nation is paying homage to martyrs of the dastardly Pulwama attack. Rahul Gandhi, a known sympathiser of LeT [Lashkar-e-Taiba] and JeM [Jaish-e-Mohammed], chooses to target not just the government but security forces as well. Rahul Gandhi will never question the real culprit, Pakistan”.

His party colleague Shahnawaz Hussain said: “This is an insult to martyrs who sacrificed their life for the country. The Congress has done this in the past as well, and people taught them a lesson for this blunder.

80,2020/02/14,Row over AIDUF MLA’s remarks on indigenous Muslims,"An Assam MLA has sparked a controversy with his alleged attempt to unite the State’s various Islamic communities while claiming that the Miya (Bengali-speaking Muslims) people in the State were more indigenous than the Ahoms.

The Ahoms ruled Assam for more than 600 years before the British annexed the territory in 1826.

Assamese Muslim groups, who often distance themselves from their Bengal-origin counterparts, have slammed MLA Aminul Islam for asking all categories of Muslims to unite in the name of religion. Mr Islam represents the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) from the Dhing Assembly constituency.

Survey under fire

The MLA, who traces his roots to undivided Bengal, had three days ago criticised the Assam government’s decision to carry out a socio-economic survey of the Assamese Muslims categorised as Goria, Moria, Deshi and Jolaha according to the period and indigenous communities they had converted from.

“Assam has 1.21 crore Muslims out of 3.3 crore people. They have accepted Assamese culture and language and identify themselves as Assamese. They study in Assamese medium schools and speak the Assamese language. In every aspect of life, they use the Assamese language. It is unfortunate that even after that, they are seen as doubtful citizens. We cannot accept the move to divide the State’s Muslims,” he had said.

The Sadou Deshi Janagosthiya Jatiya Sangsad, Assam, which represents a category of Assamese Muslims, reacted by saying that the “religion-based politics of Mr. Islam and his party has no place in Assam”. The organisation’s president Enamul Haque said the AIUDF had not been given a contract to unite various Islamic communities and advised the MLA to go to “either Bangladesh or Pakistan” to practice his ideology.

Community first

“The indigenous Muslims converted to Islam from various local communities and they take pride in keeping their communities ahead of their religion,” Mr. Haque added.

The All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) and All Assam Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad also took offence at Mr. Islam’s claim that the Ahoms were less indigenous to the State than the Ahoms.

“The Ahoms came from Myanmar, which was never a part of India, and beyond. The Bengali-speaking Miya community belonged to East Bengal, once a part of India. So who is indigenous?” Mr. Islam had said.

“The AIUDF was formed to protect illegal immigrants after the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act of 1983 was scrapped in 2005. It is not unexpected of the MLA to make such a statement,” AASU general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi, who belongs to the Ahom community, said.

Mr Islam, however, said his views had been misconstrued and he denied accusations of trying to foment communal tension.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/row-over-aiduf-mlas-remarks-on-indigenous-muslims/article30815167.ece
81,2020/02/14,Vyapam: CBI again files closure report in student’s death case,"The 19-year-old’s body was found along the rail track in Ujjain in January 2012

The Central Bureau of Investigation on Thursday again filed a closure report in the alleged murder case of a medical student, Namrata Damor, registered in connection with the Vyapam scam.

“The closure report has been submitted in an Indore court, which will issue further directions to the probe team,” said a CBI official.

The 19-year-old student’s body was found along the railway track in Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain in January 2012. About two years later, the local police filed a report in the court stating that she had committed suicide.

Following allegations that Namrata was murdered and that it was linked to the Vyapam scam, the CBI took over the case in 2015 along with those of other suspected murders, on the Supreme Court’s directive.

In December 2017, after recording statements of the witnesses and evaluating the available evidence, the CBI filed its first closure report saying that she was not murdered. She had allegedly jumped off a running train.

However, the court did not accept the report and in July 2019 directed the agency to re-investigate the case, after the girl’s father expressed dissatisfaction.

About three years after Namrata’s death, a Delhi-based TV journalist, Akshay Singh, had visited her residence in the trail of Vyapam-related alleged murders. Hours later, he died under mysterious circumstances. His family demanded a probe.

The CBI instituted a preliminary inquiry, during which it did not find any foul play.

90 convictions

The agency, which is pursuing 154 cases on the Vyapam scam, has so far secured over 90 convictions against those who subverted the entrance tests for admission to educational institutions and government jobs in the State.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Thursday that doctors, scientists and others should take up research to see that narcotic substances are not used in medicines.

At a conference on combating drug trafficking, organised for BIMSTEC partner nations, Mr. Shah said India has adopted a zero tolerance policy towards narcotics and the country’s measures to control it will be overhauled so that smuggling of drugs is stopped completely.

The “dirty money” obtained from narcotics trade is used for funding global terrorism and other transnational crimes, he said, adding “We will not allow drugs from any country of the world to enter into our country nor will we allow it to go out of the country.”

Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said that the “large harvest of opium in Afghanistan has given added supply of heroin to Bay of Bengal nations”.

“The region has also become a transportation and consumption hub for lucrative cocaine that is being trafficked into BIMSTEC nations,” Mr. Bhalla said.

According to an official statement, Asian countries are increasingly being affected by drug trafficking and BIMSTEC, being the key link between south Asian and south-east Asian nations, is one of the most effective platforms to tackle this global threat.

85,2020/02/14,"Cong. protests LPG price hike, Rahul tweets a throwback picture","The price has been hiked about six times since August 2019, says Mahila Congress

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday took a dig at the BJP over the LPG cylinder price hike by tweeting a throwback picture of the BJP leaders protesting against the hike during the Congress-led UPA era.

“I agree with these members of the BJP as they protest the astronomical ₹150 price hike in LPG cylinders,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted along with the picture of the leaders that included Smriti Irani in the frame.

The former Congress chief used the hashtag #RollBackHike as the women of his party protested across the country over the issue.

In Delhi, a delegation of women leaders including former Lok Sabha MP Sushmita Dev and former MLA Alka Lamba submitted a memorandum in the Petoleum Ministery.

When the delegation was stopped at the gate of the Shastri Bhavan by the security personnel, they resorted to a flash strike.

“The price has been hiked about six times since August 2019. It is extremely insensitive on the part of the government. It comes as a surprise that the BJP leaders who held shrill press meets when they were in the Opposition to protest the price of the LPG gas during the UPA government are today silent. It is also shocking that when the entire country is reeling under the shock of the economic crises and unemployment, a basic commodity like LPG has been made so expensive,” a statement from the All India Mahila Congress said.

“The Prime Minister takes great pride in the fact that crores of people have given up their gas subsidy for the poor. Now affording the non-subsidised gas has become extremely difficult for the citizens. It is more shocking that within 24 hours of the Delhi election results, the BJP government has increased the price. Is this revenge for their crushing defeat?” it asked.

86,2020/02/14,MVA to replicate three-party formula in Aurangabad,"Polls to municipal corporation due in April; currently Sena has the most corporators

The Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition of the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress is likely to jointly contest the crucial election to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to be held in April.

Shiv Sena MLC and the party’s Aurangabad district chief Ambadas Danve on Thursday said a preliminary meeting of the top district leaders of the three parties was held in which it was decided that the Sena, the Congress and the NCP would fight the 115-ward AMC poll together under the tentative banner of Sambhajinagar Maha Vikas Aghadi.

The AMC poll will be a litmus test for the three ideologically-opposed parties as it will be the first major election for them since their coming together to form the government in Maharashtra.

“Given that an MVA government is working well at the State level, we [Sena, Congress and the NCP] have decided to contest the AMC polls together. However, there was no discussion on seat-sharing as yet in today’s meeting. It was only a preliminary round of discussions with the Congress and NCP leaders which was held in a spirit of bonhomie, especially as we had been contesting against each other for the past several years,” Mr. Danve said.

The potentially thorny seat-sharing matter would be ironed out in subsequent discussions, he added.

While acknowledging that it would be tough to drop sitting corporators, Mr. Danve said that the candidates of each of the three parties would contest from those wards where their respective parties were the strongest.

“Our focus will be on those wards where neither of the three parties has a dominating presence,” indicated Mr. Danve.

At present, the Sena is the largest party in the 115-seat AMC, with 29 corporators, while the Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) has 24 corporators, making it the second-largest party and a force to reckon with.

The BJP has 23 seats, while the Congress and the NCP have 11 and four corporators respectively.

The MVA strategy would be to take on the AIMIM in the Muslim-dominated pockets and the BJP in the Hindu-dominated wards, said sources.

The long-pending demand of renaming of Aurangabad to Sambhajinagar is likely to feature as an emotive issue in the contest.

The renaming affair has been a hobby horse of the Shiv Sena, with a proposal regarding the same mooted in the AMC as early as 1995.

Despite Uddhav Thackeray promising the name change in 2015, the Sena has not made any headway on the issue despite Mr. Thackeray now being CM.

This has prompted the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) to seize on the Sena’s ‘failure’.

MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Thursday reached Aurangabad to shore up his party’s organisation.

Banners and posters hailing him as a Hindutva nayak (defender of the Hindutva ideal) have mushroomed throughout Aurangabad city, along with strident calls to rename the city.

The Sena, meanwhile, has dismissed the MNS with Mr. Danve saying it was a “negligible force” in the city.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3yije3/article30815072.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMAMBADASDANVE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mva-to-replicate-three-party-formula-in-aurangabad/article30815073.ece

89,2020/02/14,"10 years on, German Bakery blast continues to haunt relatives of victims","Some survivors want government to help rehabilitate those who suffered physical disabilities, others feel betrayed as some suspects are yet to be arrested

Ten years after a blast at the German Bakery in Pune claimed 17 lives and left over 50 people injured, the wounds are yet to heal as the survivors and families of those killed have still not come to terms with the losses they suffered in the tragedy.

While some survivors want the government take steps to rehabilitate those who suffered physical disabilities after the blast, others feel the victims have not got justice as some perpetrators of the crime are yet to be arrested.

Some of the survivors, family members of the killed and injured, and locals gathered outside the bakery on Thursday to pay tributes to the blast victims on the 10th anniversary of the incident.

A powerful bomb exploded at the famous eatery, located in Koregaon Park area here, on February 13, 2010.

While nine people died on the spot, eight others succumbed to injuries later in hospital. Over 50 people were injured in the blast.

Foreign nationals from Italy, Sudan, Nepal and Iran were among those killed and injured in the incident.

Amit Tulsiani, whose younger brother Vikas died in the blast, visited the bakery along with his parents for the first time on Thursday and paid tributes to the victims.

“Vikas was a young engineering graduate and had gone to meet his friend at German Bakery to discuss some courses. While he was sitting at a table and his friend went to place an order, the bomb exploded,” Mr. Tulsiani recalled. His brother succumbed to his injuries eight days later, he said.

“All these years, me and my parents never visited the blast site, but this time we decided to come here and pay our tributes,” said Mr. Tulsiani, who is a musician.

He said though the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) made a couple of arrests in the case, the victims are yet to get justice as some of the accused are still at large.

The ATS, while investigating the blast, had arrested Mirza Himayat Baig, who was awarded death sentence by a Pune court in 2013. However, the Bombay High Court set aside the death sentence in 2016 and converted it to life imprisonment.

The ATS had also arrested Indian Mujahideen (IM) operative Yasin Bhatkal, who is currently in Tihar jail in other terror-related cases. The trial against him is still going on in a Pune court.

Four other IM operatives — Mohsin Choudhary, Riyaz Bhatkal, Iqbal Ismail Bhatkal, Fayyaz Kagzi — suspected to be involved in the blast are still wanted in the case.

Vikas Gurav (50), who survived the blast, said the government should think of rehabilitating survivors of such incidents as they face difficulties in going out and finding work because of the permanent disabilities suffered by them.

“While I sustained serious injuries, one of my friends Nadia, who was from Italy, lost her life. I was in coma for the next few days,” he said.

“Even after ten years of the incident, I am still not physically fit due to the injuries I sustained. This is affecting my ability to earn a livelihood,” he said.

90,2020/02/14,10 arrested during padyatra go on hunger strike in U.P. jail,"They are accused of “instigating and misleading” people against CAA, NRC

A group of 10 students and activists, including a woman journalist who were arrested in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur district while they were on a ‘Satyagraha’ foot march to Delhi have gone on a hunger strike in the jail.

In a letter to the District Magistrate, addressed through the jail superintendent Ghazipur, they said they were starting a fast from 5 pm on Thursday against their arrest.

“We have been put in jail without a proper reason,” they said in the letter accessed by The Hindu.

“This is not just a violation of our human rights but also it is putting us to serious mental torture,” they said. “To oppose this and to avail our human and citizen rights, we all will fast until we are free.”

While the police have accused them of misleading people on the CAA and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC), friends of those arrested, under the banner of Team Nagrik Satyagraha, accused the police of trying to “shrink and divert the objective” of the yatra.

“In [the] FIR they said our yatra is against CAA and NRC. This is an attempt of police and administration to divert the whole agenda of this journey. Our yatra is against every form of violence and hate which exists in society and to spread [the] idea of Gandhi,” the group said in a statement.

District Magistrate Ghazipur and superintendent of the jail did not respond to phone calls made to inquire about the hunger strike.

The associates of the jailed persons had on Wednesday expressed shock after a local Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) court issued them notices for bail bonds of ₹2.5 lakh each, and two Gazetted persons per individual as guarantors.

The students, mostly associated with the Banaras Hindu University, along with the journalist and social activists, were leading a foot march from Chauri-Chaura near Gorakhpur to Rajghat in Delhi. On the ninth day of the march, after completing 250 km, the 10 persons were arrested in Ghazipur under Sections 107/16/151 of the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code) and sent to jail on Tuesday, said Team Nagrik Satyagraha, the organisers.

Those arrested were identified as Pradeepika Saraswat, a journalist, Manish Sharma, Sheshnarayan Ojha, Priyesh Kumar Pandey, Anant Shukla, Atul Yadav, Neeraj Rai, Raj Abhishek, Ravidnda Kumar Ravi and Murari Kumar. They are aged 25-30 years.

The SDM court of Ghazipur Sadar issued a notice asking them why they should not appear before it and submit the bonds to maintain peace and order.

They have been accused of holding the padyatra without seeking permission and allegedly “instigating and misleading” locals against the CAA and the NRC, the order notes. Their alleged acts could breach public peace and cause ‘disaffection’, the order said.

There are “enough grounds” to act against them under CrPC 107/116, the SDM said in the order shared by Team Nagrik Satyagraha with this paper.

The 10 have been sent to 14 days judicial custody.

The Team Nagrik Satyagraha described the SDM order as ‘bizarre’.

“Why will a government officer take someone’s bail when he works under the same government? This is an attempt to further suppress the democratic rights of citizens,” said the group. “They even have problem with people who are spreading idea of Gandhi and telling to stay away from Hindu-Muslim fight (sic),” the statement added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/10-arrested-during-padyatra-go-on-hunger-strike-in-up-jail/article30815171.ece

92,2020/02/14,Slapping Section 144 during CAA protests ‘illegal’: Karnataka High Court,"Court raps Bengaluru police chief.

The Karnataka High Court on Thursday declared as “illegal” the order passed by the Bengaluru City Police Commissioner imposing Section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Cr.PC) from December 19 to 21, 2019, ahead of a series of pro- and anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) rallies.

The court held that the order did not stand judicial scrutiny in terms of the parameters laid down by the Supreme Court.

The HC said the City Police Commissioner, discharging his duty as the District Magistrate (DM) had failed to give “reasons” in his December 18, 2019, order invoking Section 144 in contravention to the parameters laid down by the apex court in the cases of Anuradha Bhasin Vs Union of India and the Ramlila Maidan Incident Vs Union of India.

However, the Bench said that its order was confined only to the December 18, 2019, order passed by the District Magistrate and it had only examined the decision-making process while invoking Section 144, and had not examined the correctness of the decision.

The Bench also said the order should not be construed to mean that the State is helpless to invoke the prohibitory order if the situation so warrants.

A division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar passed the order while partly allowing a batch of petitions, in which legality and correctness of imposition of prohibitory order was questioned as several permissions for holding rallies and protests were cancelled due to invoking of Section 144.

Also, making it clear that it has not gone into the grounds on which the prohibitory order was passed, the Bench said even assuming that there were valid reasons for imposing Section 144, the order passed on December 18, 2019, by the DM can’t stand to scrutiny of law in view of Supreme Court’s orders.

Observing that the DM is expected to form an opinion citing reasons in his order for imposing Section 144, the Bench said that in the present instance, the DM has only referred to the recommendations made by eight Deputy Commissioners of Police to invoke Section 144 and ‘there was no indication of independent application of mind by the DM.”

Referring to a communication issued by the Director-General and Inspector General of Police emphasising the need for imposing Section 144 in various parts of the State, the Bench said Section 144 cannot be imposed merely relying upon opinion of superior officer as the DM has to record reasons on subjective satisfaction about the need for such prohibitory orders.

The Bench also said the DM, after receiving inputs from DCPs, should have conducted an enquiry, may be the standard of the enquiry could have been different as inputs he received was from DCPs. The Bench also pointed out that barring a few, communications received from the DCPs were identical.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8acpkv/article30814252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GUHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/slapping-section-144-during-caa-protests-illegal-karnataka-high-court/article30814253.ece
93,2020/02/14,Vizag’s concrete bulwarks bring back memories of threats from World War,"Structures found on Daspalla hills may have been from anti-ship or anti-aircraft battery, built to counter Japanese air and sea raids

A few days ago, workers were frantically trying to clear the rubble on the eastern side of the Circuit House (Governor’s Bungalow) in Daspalla Hills when they stumbled upon some concrete structures. They were baffled by the unusually thick walls that did not give away easily to repeated blows from their hammers.

Edward Paul and Mayank Devi of INTACH were passing by, when they noticed what was going on. They took a closer look and concluded that the massive assembly was part of some sort of Second World War fortification.

The discovery brings back memories of Second World War and the sleepless nights that residents faced from 1941 to 1945. The structures on the Daspalla Hills are the latest to be discovered from the era of a global war. Earlier, pillboxes were found at RK Beach.

According to retired Lt. Col. Matthew Thomas, what was found on the Daspalla Hills appears to be fortifications of an anti-aircraft battery or an anti-ship battery.

It might have been a six-gun or four-gun battery, as five such structures, square in shape and measuring about 20x20 feet, were discovered.

“The sixth may still be eluding our eyes,” said Mr. Paul, a history enthusiast at INTACH.

“The walls are made of 15-inch thick reinforced steel concrete, and from the appearance and the strategic positioning, it appears to be a gun fortification, with the central structure being the command post,” said Lt. Col. Matthews, who retired from a regiment of artillery in the Army.

The military post was located on a hillock overlooking the vast expanse of the Bay of Bengal.

“Ideally it would have served as an anti-aircraft or anti-ship battery fortification to prevent an air raid or stop ships getting closer to the shores and down below in the beach there were pillboxes to prevent a Normandy-style amphibious attack,” the retired Army officer said.

Key location

Visakhapatnam may have been described as a sleepy fishing town, but strategically, it was important for the British military, as it served as the transit point for military supplies for the ongoing Burma campaign against the Japanese Army and Subhas Chandra Bose’s INA.

The area has also witnessed action. On April 6, 1942, five Japanese fighter planes in ‘two plus three’ formation took off from a Japanese aircraft carrier located somewhere deep in the Bay of Bengal and pounded the inner harbour.

In the course of the strafing, they dropped three bombs near the port area. One of them hit a concrete pipe of five foot diameter, in which five workers had taken shelter and all of them were killed. The second fell on a cement storage and the third hit the thermal power station that was maintained by the Government of Madras. This scared the citizens and the next day, there was a huge migration to the neighbouring districts of Vizianagaram and Srikakulam and many returned only after the war ended in 1945.

On February 12, 1944, a submarine of the Japanese Imperial Navy RO -110 of the RO-100 class was sunk about 25 miles south of Visakhapatnam Harbour. The sub was tasked to sink the British military supply vessels.

This explains why the town was fortified and seen as an important military establishment, said Mr. Edward Paul.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vnxdqp/article30824588.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14KRAWW2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vizags-concrete-bulwarks-bring-back-memories-of-threats-from-world-war/article30824589.ece
94,2020/02/14,"Keep faith in Jagan, Perni tells RTC staff","Minister presents road safety and fuel-efficiency awards

Despite severe financial constraints, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had kept his promise of merging the cash-strapped AP State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) with the State government, said Transport Minister Perni Venkataramaiah, on Friday.

Speaking at the Road Safety Awards’ presentation to the best drivers, mechanics and supervisors of the APSRTC for the year 2018-19, organised by the public transport carrier, Mr. Venkataramaiah said Chief Minister of Telangana K. Chandrasekhar Rao had shot down a similar request made by the RTC workers in that State.

The Minister said the RTC employees had brought to his notice certain issues which had been taken to the notice of the Chief Minister. The workers could expect positive news any time soon. The Minister said he had known the problems of RTC employees very well as his father Krishnamurthy was the founding president of the National Mazdoor Union. He said managing a vast workforce of 51,686 employees and their families was a formidable task.

The Minister told the employees not to worry since the government was wedded to the cause of the RTC workers’ welfare. He cautioned them against getting carried away by false propaganda. He said the workers’ request for reinstatement of the employees who were asked to discontinue their job for health reasons in the past 4-5 years, was being reviewed. Efforts were also on to relax certain rules to make the workers’ lives easy, he said.

Grievance day

He said there was a proposal to hold a monthly grievance day in Vijayawada to be attended by the Executive Directors and Regional Managers of the 13 districts. The dates of the programme would be made known to officials after finalising them.

Earlier, the Minister felicitated Mehbub Bhasha and M.V. Subbaiah from Atmakur depot and Y. Krishnaiah from Nellore, the recipients of the first, second and third prizes respectively, at the State level in Road Safety category.

In fuel-efficiency section, drivers Ramana from Kakinada depot, M.S. Reddy from Mangalam depot and M. Krishnamurthy were given the awards.

95,2020/02/14,Liquor banned at Kotappakonda for Maha Sivaratri,"Darshan, security arrangements made for three-day festivities

Consumption of liquor at Kotappakonda has been prohibited by the Excise Department during the festivities which will begin atop the hill, 10 km away from Narsaraopet, on February 20.

The Department of Excise and Prohibition has issued orders declaring the three days – February 20, 21 and 22 – as “dry days”, and chalked out an action plan to implement the prohibition. Though the festival is marked by religious fervour with more than 10 lakh devotees converging on the hills, the police anticipate trouble. A carnival-like atmosphere is present during evenings when cultural programmes are held, but in the past, such events had given way to obscene dances.

Superintendent of Police, Guntur Rural, Ch. Vijaya Rao, who reviewed the arrangements at the temple along with Narsaraopet MLA Gopireddy Srinivasa Reddy, said as more than 10 lakh were expected to converge, the whole area had been divided into 24 sectors. Nine check-posts would be set up. CC cameras would be installed while police personnel would have body-worn cameras. Blue Colts teams would also be deployed.

Mr. Vijaya Rao said that 2,500 personnel were being deployed, including three additional SPs, 16 DSPs, 50 CIs, 143 SIs, 274 ASIs, 888 PCs and 900 home guards. Police strike force, quick reaction teams and women police teams were also being drafted.

Mr. Srinivasa Reddy said that all arrangements were done to make the festival a memorable one.

As many as 14 ‘prabhalu’ (rectangular frames tapering at the top made of bamboo and decorated with coloured cloth and paper) have been permitted during the procession. Each, rising to a height of over 100 feet, is carried on decorated and illuminated bullock carts accompanied by a large following.

Separate queues

The temple authorities have made elaborate arrangements anticipating a huge rush. Devotees can choose among free darshan, sighra darshan (₹100 per ticket), abhisekham (₹150 per couple) and special darshan (₹50). Those seeking to perform puja to the Mula Virat (main deity) can do so by purchasing the ₹500 ticket and special queue lines have been set up for the purpose.

Only the vehicles with special passes would be allowed to ply on the ghat road.

Brahmotsavams begin

Kurnool Staff Reporter adds: The 11-day Maha Sivaratri Brahmotsavam began at the Bhramaramba Mallikarjuna Swamy temple at Srisailam on Friday with special pujas led by temple executive officer K.S. Ramarao.

Special pujas and ‘Vajana Sevas’ have also planned for each day of the fete, which would end on February 24. The authorities have prepared about 30 lakh laddus for the event.

While about 30,000 people have visited the temple on the opening day, the footfalls are expected to increase significantly over the weekend.

Four queues have been arranged. The district authorities have also made arrangements to meet the water and sanitation needs of the visitors.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/liquor-banned-at-kotappakonda-for-maha-sivaratri/article30823302.ece

97,2020/02/14,Suspended Mahant ‘prevented’ from taking charge as custodian of Hathiramji Mutt,"High Court strikes down suspension proceedings against the Mahant

Arjun Das, the erstwhile Mahant of Hathiramji Mutt who was suspended by the State government as its custodian, attempted to take charge on Friday, but was allegedly prevented by the endowments officials. It was on January 29 that the Mahant was suspended amid charges of irregularities in land dealings and unceremoniously shunted out, following which Srikalahasti temple Executive Officer C. Chandrasekhar Reddy took charge as the custodian.

On Friday, Arjun Das attempted to take charge following the directions of High Court, wherein Justice A.V. Sesha Sai, in his verdict dated February 10, granted interim order in Writ Petition No.2391/2020, striking down the suspension proceedings of the Commissioner against the Mahant. It requires the nod from the Dharmika Parishad constituted under Section 152 of the AP Endowments Act, 1987, to initiate action on the Mahant and since the Parishad is non-existent, the Commissioner lacks jurisdiction on the issue, the court observed.

‘Politically motivated’

The Mahant told the media that the department’s action was politically motivated as all leaders of various political parties had encroached upon the Mutt lands. Refuting the allegations that he had sold away the precious Mutt lands for a throwaway price, the Mahant also pointed out that the Lord’s jewels were in the safe custody of the court.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/suspended-mahant-takes-charge-as-custodian-at-hathiramji-mutt/article30822183.ece
98,2020/02/14,Tech challenges can be turned into opportunities: RGUKT Chancellor,"‘Experiment on to provide the best quality education to the top 1% of rural undergraduates’

Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies Chancellor and Chairman of Governing Council K.C. Reddy said that while globalisation was influencing the industry, the new technology was showing impact on the society.

Governor Biswa Bushan Harichandan in a video message said the aim of the technological universities was to make India a knowledge superhighway by equipping students with necessary skills and knowledge. He was supposed to attend the conclave on Friday, but could not make it to Anantapur due to some other pre-occupation.

A combination of meeting the aspirations of the students by making them good at handling the new technology and preparing them for the likely challenges to be faced in the industry due to globalisation would lead to the students getting equipped for right atmosphere to excel.

Speaking on the second day of the Tech V-Cs’ Conclave 2020 at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Anantapur on Friday, Prof. Reddy explained how challenges could be turned into opportunities.

The Andhra Pradesh State Council for Higher Education and the RGUKT were doing a unique experiment to provide the best quality education to the top 1% of the rural undergraduates so that they are prepared to face challenges of the market when they graduate. Terming the theme of the conclave as an apt one, Prof. Reddy said that only when challenges were there students would make their mind work and find a solution, which turns into an opportunity for them and the society at large benefits from the new technologies that make their life simpler.

He congratulated JNTUA Vice-Chancellor S. Srinivas Kumar and and VTU Belgavi Vice-Chancellor Karisiddappa for taking the initiative to openly discuss these topics by inviting all the Vice-Chancellors of Technological Universities. Entire country was looking forward to the outcome of the conclave so that the best practices and new initiatives devised here could be implemented in their institutions, he said.

At the RGUKT the syllabus has been designed in such a way that prominence was being to the local issues and teaching and learning methods were implemented to bring out answers for the issues, Prof. Reddy said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/7a2mzo/article30821959.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15-VJ-TECHCONCLAVE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tech-challenges-can-be-turned-into-opportunities-rgukt-chancellor/article30821961.ece
99,2020/02/14,Tobacco farmers worry over proposed hike in National Calamity Contingent Duty,"‘Move will pave the way for smuggling of illegal cigarettes into the country’

Worried over the hike in the National Calamity Contingent Duty(NCCD) on cigarettes proposed in the Union Budget, flue-cured tobacco farmers on Friday urged the Centre to withdraw the NCCD and maintain tax stability to safeguard their livelihood.

Ahead of the e-auctions scheduled to begin in the auction platforms of Ongole I, Velampalli, Kondepi, Podili, Kanigiri and D.C.Pally from February 17, farmers at a meeting here pointed out that it was unfortunate that NCCD on tobacco products alone was continued at a time when all other taxes and surcharges were withdrawn under the new GST regime to avoid cascading of taxes.

The unimaginative taxation policy of the Centre paved the way for smuggling of illegal cigarettes into the country, which according to an international market research agency, was the fourth largest illegal cigarette market in the world and reduce the demand for locally-grown tobacco, they said.

‘Revenue loss’

Illicit cigarette trade, according to an estimate, had increased from 11.1 billion sticks in 2004 to 25.6 billion sticks in 2018, resulting in an annual revenue loss of ₹13,000 crore to the exchequer, they said.

Illegal trade thrived as a result of extremely high and constantly increasing tax rates on cigarettes and retailers pushed the sale of such cigarettes in view of higher trade margin, they explained. Moreover the smuggled cigarettes pushed by anti-social elements do not carry any pictorial warnings stipulated by the authorities defeating the very purpose of the tobacco control regime.

The farmers wanted the Tobacco Board and the Union Commerce Ministry to impress upon Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to consider their demand sympathetically during the discussion on the Budget in Parliament as lakhs of farmers, farm labourers and workers are depended on the sector for livelihood, tobacco growers association leader in Ongole II auction platform V.V.Prasad said after the meeting.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/o6a89j/article30821824.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15-VJ-TOBACCOFARM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tobacco-farmers-worry-over-proposed-hike-in-national-calamity-contingent-duty/article30821825.ece

“Prepare to protest till the government withdraws Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR),” said CPI(M) central committee member M.A Gafoor.

Mr. Gafoor claimed that there was nothing to be gained from CAA, NRC and NPR and added that the people of Delhi have voted against the ‘dark laws.’ “At least now the BJP government must realise what they are doing is not working and stop trying to divide people on the basis of religion,” he said

The CP(M) central committee member addressed the protest being held in the city by Loukika Rajyanga Parirakshana Vedika (Secular Constitution Protection Forum) on Friday.

Expressing angst over the issue, Mr. Gafoor said that the BJP party is branding anyone who is opposing CAA, NRC and NPR as traitors. He alleged that the ruling party is actively engaging in spreading hate, which is leading to protesters being murdered or being put in jails.

Commenting on the ongoing protests at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, Mr. Gafoor said that the protests have been an inspiration for the people across the country. He added that numerous intellectuals, writers and filmmakers are also protesting against CAA, NRC and NPR.

Mr. Gafoor later called on the people to protest against CAA, NRC and NPR. “This is not just a fight of Muslims. It is a matter of protecting our Constitution.

101,2020/02/14,Megalithic ‘menhirs’ face threat of vandalism,"Archaeologist urges the State government to protect the monuments

A good number of huge pillars known as ‘menhirs' and erected in the memory of the dead during the megalithic period faced a serious threat of vandalism at Nelatur Gollapalli near Kanigiri in Prakasam district.

E. Sivanagi Reddy, archaeologist and CEO, Cultural Centre of Vijayawada and Amaravati (CCVA), who inspected the megalithic avenues along with local historian Jyothi Chandramouli, has said more than 100 granite pillars had been erected in an extent of 25 acres, towards the north-east corner of the village.

The ‘menhirs’, erected in front of the iron age burials, indicated by a heap of pebbles, are spread in the entire area. The ‘menhirs’ vary in shape and size measuring 3.0 to 4.0 feet at the base and 6-0 to 10-0 feet in height above the ground level (and 4.0 or 5.0 feet buried in the ground), with a thickness of 9 inches to 18 inches.

Collective effort

Dr. Reddy has said that these monuments reflect the engineering skills and collective effort of the iron age people in collecting and planting in front of the burials. But these archaeological remains, which bear a lot of historical significance of Andhra Pradesh, have been subjected to vandalism and as a result only about 25 such monuments still remained. The local people reveal that profuse quantity of pot shreds, including red ware, black ware, black and red ware along with iron implements, have been seen at the time of widening the road and digging of irrigation canal and this indicates the iron age evidence.

“It is high time the State government take steps to declare the site as a protected one and preserve for posterity the priceless heritage,” they say.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/55t5c3/article30817544.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14ONGMONUMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/megalithic-menhirs-face-threat-of-vandalism/article30817545.ece
102,2020/02/14,Ensure pension to every weaver : Pawan,"JSP president promises to bring their plight to the Centre’s notice

Jana Sena Party (JSP) president Pawan Kalyan has promised the handloom weavers that he will take up their concerns with the Central government.

Interacting with the weavers of Yemmiganur on Thursday, Mr. Pawan Kalyan said that a roundtable would soon be organised with the weavers of Yemmiganur, Dharmavaram and Mangalagiri to know about their problems. “Besides master weavers, handloom workers too will be invited to the meeting,” the JSP president said. “There is high demand for handloom garments in the country. But the weavers are in penury. The middlemen are cornering the benefits that ought to reach the weavers,” he observed.

On the occasion, the weavers told Mr. Pawan Kalyan that most of them had been denied pension on the pretext that their children were working.

Responding to it, Mr. Pawan Kalyan asked the government to make sure that everyone received pension, and said, “Elderly people are being excluded because their children are working or they are using excess power. Where is the guarantee that the children will take care of their parents? What will the elderly persons do in such a situation?”

Housing

Earlier, the JSP president visited the G+3 houses constructed on the outskirts of Kurnool, and said that the YSRCP government was wasting public money by constructing new houses instead of using the ones built by the previous government.

“In every election, the voters are lured with the promise of giving them houses. With the change of government, a new housing scheme is brought in. The poor, however, are yet to get their houses,” Mr. Pawan Kalyan observed. He said the JSP would fight against “misuse” of public money.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/agv641/article30817483.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14VJPG4-PAWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ensure-pension-to-every-weaver-pawan/article30817484.ece

The State police department’s “Disha SoS” mobile application launched recently to help women in distress has received an overwhelming response going by the huge number of downloads made by smartphone users, police say.

In a release by the State police headquarters, Disha Special Officer Deepika Patil said the application had been downloaded over 50,000 times in the first four days, and many users had appreciated the government for such an initiative.

The officer said the application was given 4.9 stars rating on the Google’s Play store and most of the users were testing the functions of the application. “From February 9, on an average, about 2,000 users per day made test calls to the command control room through the application,” the official said.

She said the quick response by police in reaching out to the first user who was harassed in a bus in Eluru prompted many other mobile users to install the application.

According to Ms. Patil, the Disha SoS centre received three complaints through the ‘Hand Gesture’ feature. Users have to first enable the feature in the app and shake the mobile thrice to make SoS call to the police.

The command control centre also received one each case in Krishna and Visakhapatnam districts and the victims were approached and sent to One-Stop Centre for women in their respective areas, the release said.

Also, in East Godavari, a woman made an SoS call complaining that her cousin was harassing her and the police reached out to her and took the accused into custody, it was stated. Responding to another SoS call from West Godavari, a person who was harassing a girl was booked and arrested.

Bar and restaurant owners and staff who sell liquor in violation of the State Prohibition Act should be prepared from now to pay hefty fines and serve jail sentences.

Briefing newsmen on the recent amendments to the Prohibition Act, the Madya Vimochana Prachara Committee chairman V. Lakshmana Reddy told a media conference here on Thursday that those who continued to sell liquor through a network of belt shops and indulging in mobile marketing of alcohol would be imposed a fine of ₹2 lakh for the first offence and ₹5 lakh for the second offence. They could face imprisonment for a term between 6 months and 5 years depending upon the gravity of the offence, he said.

Breath analyzers would be made available in all toll plazas soon to curb drunken driving and de-addiction centres would be opened in all the districts, said Mr.Reddy, who had led a protracted struggle against liquor menace before his appointment as the head of the committee.

The excise policy adopted by the Bihar government had a very good effect on weaning tipplers away from liquor.

107,2020/02/14,Savouring the sweet smell of success,"For residents of two villages, ‘kanakambaram’ is a steady source of income

The cultivation of firecracker flower (kanakambaram) is lighting up the lives of a few hundred families in the villages of Kotha Reddipalem and Patha Reddipalem on the Machilipatnam coast. The flower belongs to the Acanthaceae family.

Bakka Venkateswaramma of Kotha Reddipalem says: “The cultivation of firecracker flower has been the only occupation for our family since long. I quit farming due to the age factor, but I continue to be associated with the post-harvesting activity, selling the flowers in the evening market in Machilipatnam.”

Favourable factors such as sandy soil and availability of groundwater encouraged the locals to go for the cultivation of the flower. Plants are imported from the Godavari districts. The plant, on an average, yields flowers for three years.

Kotha Reddipalem alone has 60-70 small landholdings in which over 100 families are engaged in the cultivation of the flower as well as marketing.

“The plant yields flowers round the year, except for a few weeks during the monsoon. The input cost is ₹10,000 to ₹15,000 per ten cents and the price per kilogram is between ₹200 and ₹800 depending on the demand, with an assured income of not less than ₹15,000 per month,” says Bakka Venkatarami Reddi, a grower.

Peak season

The flower is in great demand during summer as it coincides with the marriage season with the price touching ₹ 1,0000 per kg. Women from these two villages sell the flower in the market.

This patch of coastal villages also cultivates jasmine flower, which was introduced commercially in recent years.

Swathi Putta, a farmer, says: “Cultivation and sale of flowers is the sole activity of women in our village.”

Sensing the potential, residents of nearby villages have also started the cultivation of this flower.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/xg8p5u/article30814312.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13VJFIRECRACKERFLOWERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/savouring-the-sweet-smell-of-success/article30814313.ece

109,2020/02/14,‘Paradigm shift in tech education need of the hour’,"There should be no place for teachers who lack basic knowledge: Minister

“We sacrificed quality in technical education for the sake of quantity,” said Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh. The rot can be stemmed by weeding out useless academics and punishing professors who lack basic knowledge of their subjects.

Mr. Suresh called upon all stakeholders to take the responsibility for reversing the trend so that not only employability of graduates increases from the current 22%, but also helps the State put in place a continuous sustainable model of pedagogy as the pace of the change in technology was very fast, after inaugurating a two-day national conclave of Vice-Chancellors of technological universities here on Thursday.

Attended by 65 V-Cs, the second conclave jointly organised by Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Anantapur, and Visvesvaraya Technological University(VTU), Belagavi (Karnataka) in association with the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) marking the 75th year of setting up of the engineering college at Anantapur, the conclave aims at ‘reinventing excellence in technical education.’

While stressing on the urgent need for training teachers, the Minister said just tackling the problems of higher education in isolation was not the panacea for all ills, hence the Jagan Mohan Reddy government had focused on comprehensive improvement in the education system in the State right from the elementary level and had introduced English medium to partially overcome the challenges faced by many graduates.

“A B.Tech (honours) 5-year course is proposed in State technological universities, but the government is seeking legal and AICTE expert opinion on integrating internship in related industries,” the Minister said, adding that gaining theoretical knowledge was not enough.

AICTE Chairman Anil Sahasrabudhe acknowledged the opinion of speakers that the country had slipped in quality of education, but only focusing on employability. Creating good citizens with value-based education was the need of the hour.

Minister of Medical Education K. Sudhakar has said he plans to measure how happy people are in the State.

On the sidelines of the Institute Day celebrations at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) on Friday, the Minister said his job as the Medical Education Minister was to ensure the well-being of people in the State. “I want a holistic approach to health. Mental health needs to be given priority in schools and colleges,” he said. He added that he had taken a leaf out of Bhutan’s book. The Bhutan government measures ‘Gross National Happiness’ which helps the government in policymaking.

Assessing stress levels

He said the government would also conduct studies to assess which category of people were less stressed. “We will work on the modalities and compare different types of people. For instance, we will measure the stress levels of working women and compare them with the stress levels of homemakers,” he said. Dr. Sudhakar said he would meet different stakeholders and come up with a plan shortly.

Earlier at the programme, Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan and Dr. Sudhakar inaugurated three laboratories — Human Genome Laboratory, Autoimmune Laboratory, and Neuroinfection Laboratory.

Dr. Narayan said the new labs would ensure that people could get tested for various disorders at an affordable cost.

The High Court of Karnataka on Friday directed the government advocate to seek instructions on whether school-going children were interrogated by the police in uniform in connection with a sedition case registered against Shaheen Education Society in Bidar and others for allegedly enacting a play, using schoolchildren, to incite people to oppose the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and to give negative opinion on laws enacted by Parliament.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar issued the direction during the hearing of a PIL petition, filed by city-based advocate Nayana Jyothi Jhawar and the South India Cell For Human Rights Education and Monitoring, an NGO.

During the hearing, the counsel for the petitioners contended that 85 children, aged 9 to 12, of the school were interrogated by policemen in uniform while seeking action against police personnel for illegal examination and questioning of minor students of the school. At this juncture, the Bench orally asked the counsel whether law says that the children cannot be interrogated.

The petitioners have alleged that actions by the police in questioning the children for more than two hours in the absence of their teachers and parents and video recording the process without their consent amounts to gross violation of the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act and the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.PC).

The petitioners have also sought a direction from the court to give compensation to the parents and guardians for illegally examining the children and thereby causing mental trauma to the parents, and to direct the police to follow the law regarding safeguards to minors in respect of witness examination and issue necessary guidelines in this regard.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/were-children-interrogated-by-police-in-uniform-asks-hc/article30824542.ece

115,2020/02/14,Flood-affected people threaten agitation over unkept promises,"Officers admit that additional amount announced by CM yet to be paid to farmers

Delay in distribution of flood relief in Belagavi and surrounding districts is riling up farmers and they have threatened a series of agitations across North Karnataka.

Officers admit that while that the government has paid compensation fixed by the calamity relief fund norms to eligible farmers, the additional amount of ₹10,000 per acre promised by the Chief Minister has not been given. “There are no corresponding orders from the government on this. If the extra amount is to be paid, a separate account needs to be created and special orders need to be issued by the Finance and Revenue ministries. But that has not happened yet,” a senior officer said.

Krishik Samaj leader Sidagouda Modagi said: “We are upset that seven months after the destruction of crops, farmers are yet to get the relief promised by the Chief Minister.” The farmers held a meeting on Friday to discuss the issue.

“Mr. Yediyurappa had promised us that every family that had lost houses in the floods would get ₹5 lakh. This has not been fulfilled. Half the families have received ₹1 lakh each. Work is yet to start on schools, public buildings and infrastructure that were damaged. This is gross neglect and needs to be protested,” he said.

A third of the total cropped area of around 7 lakh hectares were hit by flooding. They include 2.16 lakh hectares of agriculture crops, 45,000 of horticulture crops and 56 hectares of sericulture crops. Farmers received compensation of around ₹2,720 per acre in non-irrigated land and ₹5,400 per acre in areas with “assured irrigation”. Farmers on 2.21 lakh hectares received compensation as per CRF norms. But the Chief Minister’s promise of adding ₹10,000 to the receivable amount per acre has not been fulfilled. Similarly, the demand by farmers to release the same compensation for the loss of small and big animals has not been met. Farmers who lost 761 animals have been compensated as per CRF norms.

Damaged houses

The CM’s assurance that houses that had suffered significant damage, but had not collapsed, would get ₹5 lakh, has not been met. “Houses have been categorised on the basis of damage. Only ‘A category’ houses will get ₹5 lakh in stages. The other category houses that suffered lesser damage will get between ₹20,000 and ₹95,000 each,” an officer said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9mbesv/article30824486.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGBELAGAVIFLOOD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/flood-affected-people-threaten-agitation-over-unkept-promises/article30824487.ece
116,2020/02/14,Changing Malnad reflected on stage,"Play depicting significant changes in the region over the years to be staged today in Hassan

A theatre troupe with a history of over 40 years has come out with a play to depict the Malnad region that has undergone significant changes over the years, owing to multiple factors — man-animal conflict, irrigation projects, infrastructure development, and heavy rain-causing floods. The play has been titled Aane Dariyalli Allola Kallola (Destruction, Devastation along Elephant Corridor).

More than 60 people have died in elephant attacks in Alur and Sakleshpur taluks of Hassan district in the last 10 years. Hundreds have been injured injuries and agriculture crops worth over crores of rupees have been damaged by the pachyderms.

It all began with the construction of Hemavati dam in the 1970s. This was followed by power projects, railway line and most recently the Yettinahole Irrigation Project, meant to carry water from the Western Ghats to dry areas of Chickballapur, Kolar and neighbouring districts.

Central metaphor

Members of Jai Karnataka Sangha, the theatre group at Bellekere in Sakleshpur taluk, witnessed all these developments and have often been victims of them. A local shop forms the central metaphor of the 90-minute play that reflects changes in the lifestyle. For instance, over time, fruits in the shop have been replaced by water bottles and carbonated beverages. An English nameboard replaces the Kannada one. And, in the end, the shop collapses following a flood caused by heavy rains, reminding the audience the havoc caused in August 2019.

Prasad Rakshidi, author and director of the play, says that about eight years ago, Rangayana in Mysuru had requested him to direct a street play on the man-animal conflict for its annual theatre festival Bahuroopi. The idea was mooted by the government-run repertory in the backdrop of an elephant attack in Mysuru city, in which one person was killed. “After an elephant entered the city, people began to understand the gravity of the problem faced by those in the Malnad area. We did a street play for the festival and that was the first draft of the screenplay adopted for this play,” he said.

The troupe that began its activities with illiterate agriculture labourers as actors from villages nearby, has produced more than 35 plays so far. They have an open-air theatre, where many well-established repertories stage plays.

Rangasiri, another theatre group in Hassan, will host the play on the CSI School premises in Hassan on Saturday.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/st57ji/article30824460.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGAANEDARIYALLIALLOLAKALLOLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/changing-malnad-reflected-on-stage/article30824461.ece

This institute offers advanced training and candidates coming out of CIPET will be able to get employment immediately, he said.

Earlier, Large and Medium industries Minister Jagadish Shettar said that the idea of setting up this institute was first conceived by Union Minister late Anant Kumar during his stint as the Union Chemical and Fertilizer Minister in the first Ministry of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He has also urged Mr. Sadananda Gowda to make a formal announcement in this connection.

Mr. Shettar said that though Karnataka is one among the few States that are considered industrial-friendly, industrial development in tier two cities is yet take place.

The government is focusing on industrial development in tier two cities. However, the mindset among industrialists was to invest in and around Bengaluru. Most of the major industrial houses are not even aware of other cities, including Hubballi or Belagavi.

Steps have been taken to apprise them of the development of transport, especially air connectivity, and other infrastructure in tier two cities. The objective of holding this conference here was to make industrialists be aware of North Karnataka region and the growth potential here. It is heartening to note that nearly 40 industrialists have signed memorandums of understanding here to invest in tier two cities, he said.

A few of the major investment proposals that exceeded a thousand crores, including an MoU worth an investment of ₹ 50,000 crore of Rajesh Exports, were signed during the inaugural session of the event in the presence of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. The remaining MoUs ranging from a few crores to a few thousand crores were signed and documents exchanged during the valedictory session in the presence of Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi.

Rajesh Mehta of Rajesh Exports, which has proposed to invest ₹ 50,000 crore for establishing a unit to manufacture electric vehicles and lithium cells and batteries, declared that Karnataka had the best ecosystem for investment and appealed to others to invest in the State.

Some of the other MoUs pertaining to major investment proposals that were signed during the event were: Sonali Power Private Limited for hybrid wind and solar power project in Davangere district (₹ 4,800 crore); Netcap Power Pvt. Ltd for waste to energy MSW and biomass conversion to fuel and electricity at Hubballi (₹ 3,000 crore); Jettwings Aerospace and Aviation Ltd. for setting up Jettwings Flight Training Academy at Dharwad (₹ 2,060 crore); Ayana Renewable Power Private Limited for Solar/ Wind/ Hybrid power project at Hubballi (₹ 3,000 crore), and Luxor Power Private Limited for 275 MW solar power project at Mulvad in Vijayapura district (₹ 1,200 crore).

HPCL and IOCL were also among the public sector companies that signed MoUs for their projects in North Karnataka. The investment proposals pertained to projects in various sectors in the districts of Dharwad, Gadag, Haveri, Davangere, Belagavi, Yadgir and others. The projects pertain to hybrid power, food processing, machinery, construction industry, FMCG and other sectors.

Addressing a press conference after the valedictory session along with Union Ministers Pralhad Joshi and Suresh Angadi, Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar said that the investors meet had received overwhelming response and for the first time, companies had come in good numbers to invest in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. This was a welcome development for ensuring uniform industrial development in the State, he added.

He said that the MoUs would be taken forward and pursued by the officials of the departments concerned to facilitate early execution. He said that he would personally review the progress in the coming months.

To a query, Mr. Pralhad Joshi said that the percentage of MoUs materialising could vary and it was natural. But efforts would be made to ensure that more MoUs were executed and for that to happen, there was a need for lower-level officials to have a positive approach while giving clearances, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2qt861/article30824192.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15HBHUBBALLIMOUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/overwhelming-response-to-invest-karnataka-hubballi-conference/article30824193.ece

Inaugurating the Invest Karnataka-Hubballi Conference organised by the Commerce and Industries Department and Karnataka Udyog Mitra here on Friday, Mr. Yediyurappa said that Sir M. Visvesvaraya’s famous dictum “Industrialise or Perish” would be the industrial philosophy of his government.

Removing hitches

According to Mr. Yediyurappa, availability of hi-tech technology and trained workforce has created an industrial-friendly atmosphere in the State. After holding one-to-one discussion with industrialists at the Davos conclave held in Switzerland recently, the State government has taken steps to remove hitches in the way of industrial investment. As a major step, the Land Reforms Act has been amended to make land conversion process faster and hassle-free, he said.

Referring to the industrial growth in North Karnataka region, he said that the State government has given approval to setting up global manufacturing clusters in the region.

Under this plan, various clusters, including an FMCG in Dharwad, toy manufacturing in Koppal, solar implements in Kalaburagi, agriculture machinery in Bidar, and others would come up, he added.

He said that major industrialists always preferred Karnataka, especially Bengaluru and surrounding areas, to set up their units. The government would take steps to channelise industrial investment to tier two cities now, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wkv9d9/article30824163.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15HBHUBBALLIINVESTINAUGURATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-is-aligned-with-pm-modis-5-trillion-economy-aim-cm/article30824164.ece

The trio slipped and were washed away near Shambhulingaiahna Katte, Arun Nage Gowda, Deputy Superintendent of Police (Srirangapatna subdivision), said. According to Srirangapatna police, the three hailed from Hassan district and they did not know to swim.

121,2020/02/14,Tourism sector hits lean patch,"It is a seasonal phase; most families do not venture out as it is exam time

The tourism sector in Mysuru is going through a lean patch with the footfall hitting a low in the run-up to the end of the financial year.

The palace, which normally attracts thousands of tourists daily, appears deserted at this time of the year. Similar is the case with other places of tourist interest in Mysuru and surrounding areas including Srirangapatna.

But contrary to perceptions, this has nothing to do with the COVID-19 or the fear surrounding it though the lowdown in the tourism sector was initially attributed to the fear arising out of the spread of the virus. This is a seasonal phase and the low follows the peak the sector attains during December/January.

Palace Board officials who maintain a daily record of the number of tourists visiting the Amba Vilas Palace said the visitors’ flow tends to dip from the second or third week of January every year and hit a low during February and March.

This is because the academic year draws to a close around March and the final examination for schools and board exams for PUC/12th standard students are held during the months extending upto April. Consequently, domestic tourists – who keep the tourism sector floating in Mysuru – do not travel during February/March and April.

A comparison of the number of tourists who visited the palace in February last year with the footfall this year indicates that there is no significant decline in the tourist inflow. The palace attracted 93,566 tourists between February 1 and 13 this year and the number of visitors during the corresponding period last year was 97,978, the difference being negligible given the minor fluctuation that takes place on a daily basis.

The statistics of the number of visitors to the palace gives a broad trend of the tourist inflow as it is considered that very few first-time visitors to the city skip the palace though the same cannot be said about other places including the zoo which also attracts local visitors.

Stakeholders in the hospitality sector whose fortunes hinges on the tourist inflow also aver that the occupancy rates in most hotels tends to be low during February and March as it is examination time. Mysuru receives nearly 3.5 million tourists every year and generates nearly 80,000 to 100,000 direct employment and keeps the wheels of the city economy turning. More than 50 per cent of the tourists tend to be from the neighbouring States of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Almost 95 per cent of the tourists visiting Mysuru are domestic travellers; international tourists make up for hardly 1 or 2 per cent of the total traffic.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/h2aqtx/article30823968.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MYSLEAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tourism-sector-hits-lean-patch/article30823969.ece
122,2020/02/14,Bank clerk accused of murdering wife in a fit of rage,"A farmer from Kalaburagi has complained to the Belagavi police that his daughter was killed by his son-in-law in Belagavi on Thursday evening.

Parashuram Pise, a clerk at a bank in Belagavi, strangulated his wife, Kavita (25), and lied to her parents and his relatives that she had taken sleeping pills to end her life, V.S. Rangadal has said in his complaint to the camp police.

The police said the accused killed his wife in a fit of rage. “But he tried to hide it saying that she needed to be treated. He took her to the civil hospital where she was declared brought dead,” an investigating officer said.

“Kavita had told him to pick up their daughter after school. But Parashuram Pise forgot. When she reminded him of this, he shouted at her. When the husband and wife fought over this, he lost his temper and strangulated her,” the officer said. The couple had been married for six years. They have two daughters one aged five years and the other six months old.

Doctors in the civil hospital completed the post-mortem procedure on Friday.

125,2020/02/14,JD(S) opposes closure of Hassan engineering college,"The JD(S) on Friday alleged a “glaring discrimination” in sanctioning funds and implementing development works in the State by the BJP government and opposed the closure of the Government Engineering College at Mosalehosahalli in Shantigrama hobli of Hassan taluk.

JD(S) leader and former Minister H.D. Revanna alleged that Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, who holds the Higher Education portfolio, has ordered the closure of the college which was started in the 2019-20 academic year. 173 students had obtained admissions the college and it had obtained necessary clearances from AICTE and Visvesvaraya Technological University, he said.

Out of 13 government engineering colleges, the Hassan college ranked 4th in terms of admission of students and a large number of poor students were studying here. Out of 173 students, 165 students have been receiving scholarships, he claimed.

He also came down heavily on the government for its proposal to close 30 polytechnics in the State. The JD(S) will launch a protest if the government closed educational institutions, Mr. Revanna warned.

Mr. Narayan in his order directed the authorities to use the college building for skill development or innovation purposes. Several crores had been spent on construction of the building, Mr. Revanna said.

Only 62 students got admission in the government engineering college at Karwar. Despite that, the government had not ordered its closure, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jds-opposes-closure-of-hassan-engineering-college/article30822855.ece
126,2020/02/14,Ready to give up forest portfolio if CM wants me to: Anand Singh,"Of the 15 cases against me, 12 have been stayed and three are under trial, says the Minister

Newly-appointed Environment and Forest Minister Anand Singh, who is in the middle of a controversy over cases pending against him under the Forest Conservation Act, said that he was ready to give up the portfolio if Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa wanted him to.

Speaking to presspersons here on Friday, Mr. Singh said: “All that I have declared in my election affidavit is true. Yes, there are 15 cases against me. I don’t want to keep people of the State in the dark. That is not the kind of politics I want to do.” Mr. Singh was one of the 17 legislators who defected from the Congress-JD(S) coalition, which helped the BJP form the government last year.

Noting that that there was no chargesheet against him, Mr. Singh said of the 15 cases pending against him, 12 had been stayed by court and three were under trial.

Mr. Singh was inducted into the Cabinet a few days ago and was initially given the Food and Civil Supplies portfolio. In a quick reshuffle, the Chief Minister allocated the Forest and Environment portfolio to him the next day.

In his election affidavit filed during the 2019 byelections, the Vijayanagara MLA declared 15 cases pending against him.

A party hopper, Mr. Singh was a Minister in the BJP government during 2008-13. He joined the Congress ahead of the 2018 Assembly polls. After being denied a Cabinet berth in the coalition government headed by H.D. Kumaraswamy, he quit the Congress in 2019 and joined the BJP.

Principal District and Sessions Court in Bidar on Friday granted conditional bail to Nazbunnisa and Fareeda Begum who were arrested on January 30 on sedition charges.

The sedition case was filed against the Shaheen School management in connection with children staging a play as part of their annual day celebrations on January 21, in which a character had allegedly delivered a dialogue “insulting” Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Ms. Nazbunnisa was arrested for “teaching” the controversial dialogue to her 11-year-old daughter who delivered it and Ms. Fareeda Begum, the headmistress of the school, for allowing the controversial performance.

The judge, Managoli Premavati Mallikarjuna, granted bail upon executing a personal bond for ₹1 lakh with two sureties for the like sum. Among the bail conditions is that the accused should appear before the investigating officer as and when called upon and extend cooperation in investigation. The order also said that the accused shall appear before the court concerned on all the dates of the hearing, unless prevented by any genuine cause.

128,2020/02/14,"Post-floods, Kodagu is still longing to draw in tourists","While hoteliers lament fall in arrivals, some other stakeholders are satisfied

How many tourists did Kodagu, the land of misty hills, attract in the recent flood-ravaged years?

If the statistics shared by the Tourism Department are to be believed, Kodagu recorded a moderately good number of tourists in 2018 and 2019, the years that the district witnessed devastating floods and landslides.

Stakeholders in the tourism industry had stated in the past that back-to-back floods and landslides had a major impact on tourist footfall, eventually forcing the district administration to intervene and take up confidence-building measures, telling tourists that Kodagu was safe to visit.

The Tourism Department’s statistics reveal that 17 lakh visited Kodagu in 2018 and 18 lakh in 2019. This means the flood-ravaged years did attract tourists contrary to what the stakeholders had claimed.

“These figures are based on the gate collections at the famous tourist spots in Madikeri, especially Raja Seat, Cauvery Nisargadhama near Kushalnagar, and Archaeology Museum. The number would be even more if we had accounted for the footfall at Iruppu falls and other destinations,” argues Raghavendra, Assistant Director, Tourism Department, Madikeri.

He told The Hindu that in the years before the floods and landslides Kodagu used to attract less than two million visitors and the footfall data collected for the last two years was in tune with the method practised since over five years.

“The footfall had dropped substantially only during the months of floods and landslides and their subsequent period but not the entire year,” he maintained.

However, the Kodagu Hotels, Restaurants and Resorts’ Owners’ Association and other stakeholders, citing drop in tourists’ numbers, had sought the government’s intervention for boosting the footfall with promotions as they claimed that tourists were reluctant to visit the hill station after the two successive calamities that destroyed properties worth crores of rupees. It therefore drove the coalition government to hold Kodagu Pravasi Utsav last year to attract tourists.

Association President B.R. Nagendra Prasad said the tourists’ arrivals had dropped by almost half when compared to the years before the floods which used to draw not less than 30-35 lakh annually. Weekends used to draw around one lakh tourists and the number has dropped to 10,000, he added.

Kodagu has around 30,000 rooms and all of them used to get occupied during the season in the past (before floods). There were situations when tourists used to spend their nights in their vehicles, unable to get rooms. Such was the scenario, said Mr. Prasad. “Contrary to the statistics of Tourism Department, we continue to argue that Kodagu tourism hasn’t returned to its past glory. The recovery process is still on.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2sd0bj/article30823899.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MYSNEWTALACAUVERY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/post-floods-kodagu-is-still-longing-to-draw-in-tourists/article30821974.ece
129,2020/02/14,Assembly to debate on Constitution on Mar. 2 and 3,"As the public debate over the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the Constitution of India continues across the nation, the Karnataka Legislative Assembly has decided to set aside two days – March 2 and 3 – for a special discussion on the significance of the Constitution and extent to which it has succeeded in meeting aspirations of people in the last 70 years.

Assembly Speaker Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri told mediapersons on Friday that the Assembly would act as a platform for legislators to speak about the relevance of the Constitution. He held a round of discussion with senior legislators and they have expressed willingness to participate in the debate. More details of the discussion would be worked out in the next few days after a meeting of the Business Advisory Committee of the House on February 18, Mr. Kageri said.

Asked whether it would be possible to have discussions above partisan politics on the Constitution in the present scenario, Mr. Kageri said: “I have appealed to members that they should discuss the Constitution beyond their political prism.” Each member will speak on a particular topic of the Constitution, he said.

On a question whether the Assembly would a pass a resolution on CAA after the discussion, the Speaker said there was no such proposal before him.

Mr. Kageri said he had planned to hold a conference on the Constitution in November last but the programme was cancelled owing to bypolls to 15 Legislative Assembly constituencies.

Governor Vajubhai Vala will address the joint session of the State legislature on Monday at 11 a.m. The House will discuss the vote on the motion of thanks to the Governor’s address till February 20. The House will be adjourned on February 20 for meeting again on March 2 and it will conclude on March 31.

130,2020/02/14,‘Take strict action against doctors shirking duty’,"Sumalatha says there have been complaints of doctors abstaining from work across the district

Taking strong objection to government doctors shirking duty at their designated health institutions, Mandya MP Sumalatha on Thursday issued strict instructions to the Health Department to take action against them in accordance with the law.

She was speaking while reviewing the progress of various Centre-sponsored schemes at the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee meeting held at the zilla panchayat auditorium.

Stressing the need for government doctors to work in their designated hospitals during the stipulated timings, the MP said there have been complaints about doctors abstaining from work across the district.

The actor-turned-politician asked District Health Officer H.P. Manche Gowda whether he had observed the developments and taken any measures against such doctors. She also asked the officer if he had visited any places to attend to such complaints.

Mr. Gowda told Ms. Sumalatha that attendance registers were kept at all health institutions and the Department of Health and Family Welfare was an implementing biometric attendance system at all taluk hospitals, primary health centres and community health centres. To this, Ms. Sumalatha said that the attendance registers could have signatures in spite of doctors abstaining from work.

Deputy Commissioner M.V. Venkatesh also took strong objection to the Health Department not deploying ambulances to meet medical emergencies at ‘black spots’ identified at 28 places across the district.

Nagamangala MLA K. Suresh Gowda, the lone MLA who attended the meeting from the district, requested officials to publicise the scheme that offers financial assistance to the poor to conduct funerals/cremations.

He also expressed displeasure with the authorities concerned for their failure in curbing illegal stone extraction in the district.

131,2020/02/14,Tea stalls caught selling loose cigarettes in Mysuru,"Tea stalls in Mysuru which were caught selling loose cigarettes during a surprise raid on Wednesday face the prospect of having an FIR registered against them.

The State government has issued a notification banning the sale of loose cigarettes. “It is illegal to sell loose cigarettes,” said Selvaraj, State nodal officer of the Anti-Tobacco Cell.

The tea stalls in the vicinity of suburban bus stand in Mysuru were caught off guard when a team of government officials, led by Additional Deputy Commissioner B.R. Poornima, carried out a surprise inspection on Wednesday evening. They were selling cigarettes, beedis and other tobacco products in violation of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003. But, unlike most occasions when they manage to get away by paying a penalty, the tea stall owners now stare at the prospect of having an FIR registered against them.

Sending a message

The Additional Deputy Commissioner has asked officials to lodge an FIR so that a strong message is sent out to violators of the rule. “The Health Department has filed a complaint and an FIR is in the process of being lodged against six tea stall owners,” said Shivakumar, the district consultant on the National Tobacco Control Programme. Mr. Shivakumar said FIRs were normally not lodged in most cases of COTPA violation, and this would be a first in Mysuru.

With an amendment to COTPA making graphic pictorial warning mandatory on packets of tobacco products, though the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products bearing the warning is not illegal, that of loose cigarettes is interpreted as illegal.

Also, shops selling packets of cigarettes and other tobacco products should have signages stating that smoking in public is banned. Shops selling tobacco products should not be within a 100-metre radius of an educational institution.

The authorities chose the tea stalls around the suburban bus stand for the crackdown as the area is always teeming with people, including the elderly, women and children.

The team seized 26 packets of cigarettes, 51 packets of chewing tobacco and other items, including beedi packets valued around ₹8,000. Since April 2019, the authorities have booked 1,162 cases of COTPA violation in Mysuru and collected a penalty of ₹2.19 lakh.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tea-stalls-caught-selling-loose-cigarettes-in-mysuru/article30814580.ece
132,2020/02/14,Title deed distribution programme cancelled over politics between leaders,"A programme scheduled to distribute title deeds to several families, who were identified 36 years ago, at Hanakere village was postponed indefinitely on Thursday owing to the alleged non-cooperation by Mandya MLA M.

Hanakere is the native village of Mr. Srinivas, a veteran JD(S) leader. Mandya MP Sumalatha had planned to issue the title deeds to the families. Nevertheless, Mr. Srinivas wrote to the district administration to cancel the programme as the scheme was formulated by the State government. It is said that the MLA warned of moving a breach of privilege motion in the Assembly if the MP distributed the title deeds.

Ms. Sumalatha, in spite of the cancellation of the programme, visited the village on Thursday morning and interacted with the beneficiaries and other villagers.

Many beneficiaries accused the MLA of politicising the issue. Ms. Sumalatha, meanwhile, took Mandya tahsildar D. Nagesh and Mandya Taluk Panchayat executive officer Ganganna to task for cancelling the programme.

133,2020/02/14,Karnataka Bandh evokes no response in Mysuru,"It was business as usual in the city on Thursday as the bandh called by various Kannada outfits seeking priority for locals in jobs evoked no response.

It was supposed to be a Statewide shutdown, but educational institutions, the public transport system, and business and commercial establishments functioned as usual. The bandh call was issued by the Karnataka Sanghatanegala Okkoota, urging the government to implement the recommendations of the Sarojini Mahishi report which lays emphasis on ensuring priority to Kannadigas in jobs in both private and public sector undertakings.

But the call went unheeded but for the representatives of the organisations supportive of the bandh. They assembled at Gandhi Square near Town Hall and raised slogans.

Members of the Mysuru Horatagarara Samiti, who supported the bandh call, said the strike was “symbolic”. They assembled in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s office in the city and submitted a memorandum to the government with their demands.

The forum members said the people of the State had been denied prominence and deprived of jobs in both private and public sector undertakings, and this had led to an influx of people from other parts of the country to the State. They said the policy in other States was to accord priority to locals.

Members of Mysuru Zilla Kannada Chaluvaligarara Sangha said the investors coming to Karnataka promise jobs to locals and take land, water and power at subsidised rates, but then go back on their word when it comes to employing Kannadigas.

The activists said successive governments in the State and all political parties had failed to implement the recommendations of the Sarojini Mahishi report though it was tabled 34 years ago. Writer C.P. Krishna Kumar, Sangha president B.A. Shivashankar and others were present.

“It is not possible to implement the scheme suddenly as it requires a lot of preparation,” the Minister said, while pointing out that four agricultural universities and a horticultural university would be roped in to educate farmers about Israel model of farming.

A preparatory meeting in this regard was held with the vice-chancellors of universities and officials concerned about a month ago, he said.

Mr. Patil said the process of transferring ₹6,000 to the accounts of all the registered farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi would be completed within the next 15 days in Karnataka.

Expressing concern over the menace of spurious seeds, the Minister said a letter would be written to the DG&IGP seeking co-operation from the police in cracking the whip on those indulging in sale of spurious seeds.

Mr. Patil, who had earlier been allocated forest portfolio, said the agriculture portfolio had been given to him by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa following his request. However, he remarked that agriculture portfolio was like a bed of thorns.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/implementation-of-israel-farming-system-will-not-be-shelved-bc-patil/article30814474.ece
136,2020/02/14,Health Department set to start eye collection centres in district hospitals,"Move aimed at bridging the gap between demand and supply of corneas

To promote eye donation and bridge the huge gap between demand and supply of corneas, the Health Department is set to start eye collection centres in district hospitals soon.

Increasing the number of eye donations is crucial as corneal blindness can be treated only through transplantation from eye donations as there is no substitute for human tissue.

Although, an average of 57,000 eyes are collected across India annually, there are approximately 15 lakh corneal blind people who are in need of transplant in the country. Moreover, every year, nearly 20,000 people are detected with corneal blindness, according to the National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment.

In 2018–19, of the 5,561 eyes collected in Karnataka, more than 4,500 were from Bengaluru alone. Although people from rural areas are pledging eyes, lack of collection centres in district and taluk hospitals has hit donations.

“Although the plan is to start eye collection centres in all government hospitals, we initially plan to start with district hospitals. While collection centres have already started functioning in a few places, all districts will be covered in a phased manner,” State Health Director Om Prakash Patil told The Hindu.

“Our aim is to promote eye donation by improving coordination between private hospitals and government hospitals. The collection centres in the district hospitals will be linked to the nearest eye bank,” he said, and added that there were 37 eye banks in the State, including eight run by the government.

A senior official in the department’s Ophthalmology division said the move would also help in getting good quality corneas. “As of now, nearly half of the collected corneas are not utilised mainly because of infections in the donor or because there is a delay in collecting. Eyes should be collected within six hours after death,” the official said.

Highlighting the gap between the demand and supply, K. Bhujang Shetty, chairman and managing director of Narayana Nethralaya, said in Bengaluru alone, there were close to 400 deaths a day but out of these less than eight eyes were being collected. “It is deeply saddening to see this huge gap. Corneal blindness can be treated only through transplantation from eye donations since there is no substitute for human tissue,” said Dr Shetty, who heads Dr. Rajkumar Eye Bank, one of the first started in 1993.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/health-department-set-to-start-eye-collection-centres-in-district-hospitals/article30814383.ece
137,2020/02/14,‘Time running out to reduce greenhouse gas emissions’,"The ‘Future of Earth, 2020’ report enlists five key global risks

Five global risks that have the potential to impact and amplify one another in ways that may cascade to create global systemic crisis, have been listed by “The Future of Earth, 2020”, which was released here on Thursday by the South Asia Future Earth Regional Office, Divecha Centre for Climate Change, Indian Institute of Science.

The report, released by K. Kasturirangan, former Chairman, ISRO, lists failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation; extreme weather events; major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; food crises; and water crises, as the five global risks.

As many as 222 leading scientists from 52 countries conducted the survey by Future Earth, an international sustainability research network. The Bengaluru launch was among similar parallel ones across other parts of the world scheduled between February 13 and 21.

The report was prepared with the aim of reducing carbon footprint and halting global warming below 2 degree Celsius by 2050.

Offering examples of how the interrelation of risk factors play a role, scientists say extreme heat waves can accelerate global warming by releasing large amounts of stored carbon from affected ecosystems, and at the same time intensify water crises and/ or food scarcity. The loss of biodiversity also weakens the capacity of natural and agricultural systems to cope with climate extremes, increasing our vulnerability to food crises, they point out.

Politics, biodiversity and climate change

Among the chapters in the report is one on climate, focusing on ‘dialing down the heat’.

Lead author Diana Liverman, School of Geography and Development, University of Arizona, points out that over the last 18 months, major assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the US National Climate Assessment, and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, have all argued that time is running out to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“This has inspired declarations of a climate crisis or climate emergency by the leaders of more than 700 cities, States and governments. Yet, during 2019, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached more than 415 ppm, and the five years from 2014 to 2018 were the warmest recorded over land and ocean since 1880,” read the report.

In another chapter, ‘Populism versus grassroots movements’ author Richard Calland, University of Cambridge’s Institute for Sustainability Leadership, and Associate Professor of Public Law, University of Cape Town, said “right-wing populism, a breed of politics that exploits people’s fears during times of economic decline and growing inequality, and that focuses on nationalist tendencies to clamp down on borders and reject immigrants,” is on the rise around the world. This, he argues, often leads to a denial of climate change facts or impacts.

Humans have now “significantly altered” 75% of our planet’s land area; about a quarter of species in assessed plant and animal groups are threatened, writes Cornelia Krug, Department of Geography, University of Zurich, Switzerland, lead author of ‘The unravelling web of life’, in the chapter on biodiversity, pointing out that in 2018, the world’s last male northern white rhino died in his Kenyan enclosure, while the Brazillian blue parrot, Spix’s Macaw, was declared extinct in the wild. “Reversing the trends of loss of life on this planet will require some new ways of thinking about conservation,” the author says.

On food, lead author Jiaguo Qi, Center for Global Change and Earth Observations, Michigan State University, USA, speaks about ‘rethinking global security’. “Strains on food production are expected to increase, as a result of various forces including climate change, biodiversity loss, and a global population on the rise,” the author says.

Tracking false news

False news travels six times faster and can reach up to 100 times more people, says the ‘Our future on earth’ report on the role of media.

Lead author Owen Gaffney, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Stockholm Resilience Centre, in ‘Industrializing disinformation’, says the flow of information in the world is changing, as today, around half of the planet’s 7.6 billion people are online, deeply influenced by social media, search engines and e-commerce algorithms.

“These digital platforms tend to favour the spread of information designed to engage with emotion over reason, can cause the propagation of “fake news”, and can lead to social harms like an erosion of trust in vaccines,” the author says.

Environmental health and education

Dr. Kasturirangan, who released the report, said the National Education Policy will address the question of environmental health and education at the school level.""Children in the last four years of secondary education will have a reasonable grounding to be sensitive towards the environment. Without it no government rules and policies can be helpful,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of the launch.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/time-running-out-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions/article30814369.ece

139,2020/02/14,Bidar sedition case: Brinda condemns arrest of 2 women,"She meets them in jail and then visits Shaheen School

Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Brinda Karat, along with Janwadi Mahila Sanghatana leader K. Neela, visited Bidar jail on Thursday and met the two women put behind bars in connection with a school play that allegedly had remarks “insulting” Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Nazbunnisa, the single mother of a 11-year-old girl who allegedly delivered the “insulting” dialogues, and Fareeda Begum, head teacher of Shaheen School where the play was staged, are facing sedition charges. The authorities of the school too are facing sedition charges.

Speaking to reporters outside the jail later, Ms. Karat termed Section 124A (Sedition) of the Indian Penal Code as a “black law” brought by the British to use against Indian freedom fighters and demanded its abolition. She alleged that the BJP governments at the Centre and the State had double standards in using such laws.

“BJP leaders are abusing, using communal language and inciting people to violence, but not even an FIR is filed. But, here a child saying some words in innocence in a play leads to the arrest of her mother and teacher. It is worse than what the British did. It is absolutely ridiculous to put them under sedition charges,” she said. “This law was brought by the British and used against Indian freedom fighters. Today, those who are defending the Constitution are being accused of being anti-nationals. [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi’s Ministers incite people to shoot and nothing is done to them. When a child in a play utters some words, her mother faces sedition charges.”

She added that both the arrested women were breadwinners of the family.

“It is a shame that neither the National Human Rights Commission nor the National Commission for Women has come to their aid,” she said.

Later, Ms. Karat visited Shaheen School and interacted with the girl who had allegedly delivered the controversial dialogue and also with the school management.

The sedition case was filed on January 26 following a complaint by Neelesh Rakshyala, an activist, based on a video clip of the play staged by schoolchildren as part of the annual day celebrations held on January 21. The play was on the theme of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8icje9/article30814240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGBIDARBRINDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bidar-sedition-case-brinda-condemns-arrest-of-2-women/article30814241.ece

The stage is set for the first-ever investors meet outside Bengaluru. And, Hubballi, which carries the tag of a commercial city, has all been spruced up to invite investors from across the country through “Invest Karnataka-Hubballi Conference” scheduled to be held on Friday.

Reviewing the preparations for the event along with Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar here on Thursday, Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi said that for the first time in the history of the country, an investors meet was being held in a tier-2 city and there were a lot of expectations from the meet about investments in the region.

Mr. Joshi said that investors and reputed companies had been invited on behalf of both the State and Union governments to participate in the investors meet. “We have received confirmation of participation from reputed companies such as Godrej, Adani Group, Tata Group, Hinduja, L&T.

142,2020/02/14,"Delhi Assembly poll results a tight slap on the face of BJP, RSS, says Brinda Karat","Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Brinda Karat said that the Aam Aadmi Party’s mandate in the Delhi Assembly elections was a “tight slap” on the BJP’s and RSS faces.

Addressing a gathering at the divisional-level conference on ‘Empowerment of women’ and ‘Save the Constitution’ here on Thursday, Ms. Karat said that by voting the AAP to power the people of Delhi have given a befitting reply to the RSS agenda and BJP’s politics of hate and violence.

She slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that when the entire nation was bothered about the GDP and the economic crisis, Mr Modi has only two agendas: Shaheen Bagh and Pakistan. “I am proud of the Shaheen Bagh women who have become the face of resistance against the rise of fascism”.

Reiterating her concern that despite repeated condemnation of violence against women, Ms. Karat said that crimes against women were at an all-time high with one rape occurring every 90 minutes in India.

Accusing Home Minister Amit Shah of the alleged misuse of the Delhi police, Ms. Karat said that Mr. Shah and the BJP leaders used all means to win Delhi elections but they failed.

“Though the BJP leaders used the Delhi election rallies to express their hate as a campaign message, the National Commission for Women maintained a silence. Even the Election Commission failed to impose serious action against the BJP leaders for their hate speeches,” she added.

Ms. Karat alleged that the Modi-led government was trying to change the Constitution and called upon people to unite against their divisive and dangerous attempts to destroy the nation’s secular fabric with the draconian Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

“Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah have misled the people on the CAA and the NRC.

143,2020/02/14,Activists highlight functioning of ashram schools,"They want them to be brought under Department of Education

Tribal activists have drawn the attention of the government to the functioning of the ashram schools in the State and want a policy change so that they are brought under the Department of Education.

Ashram schools were introduced in the 1960s – though some of them were established earlier - and functions under the Department of Tribal Welfare.

However, the passout rate is reckoned to be meagre. “There are hardly a handful of graduate from these tribal communities though crores have been spent on them over many decades,” said M.B. Prabhu, social activist.

He said that given the high dropout rates and failure to even complete SSLC, none of them qualify for government jobs.

“Hence it is imperative to announce community-specific reservation for these primitive tribal groups. If they are brought under the Scheduled Tribes category, the benefits will be cornered by the other non-primitive communities,” he added.

S. Sreekanth, of Development through Education (DEED), said though they have been raising this issue for the last few decades it had fallen on deaf ears, and alleged that nobody in the government was serious about uplifting the standards of the ashram schools.

“There is an ashram School in Neralukuppe village in Hunsur taluk which is functioning for 60 years, but so far it has not produced a single graduate,” said Mr. Sreekanth.

Mr. Prabhu and his team recently completed an informal survey of the ashram schools in Karnataka and found out that there are nearly 116 such institutions catering to tribal communities.

The dropout rate is very high and even those who reach SSLC are unable to read or write properly, as per their findings.

“The highest post the tribals from Mysuru region aspire to reach is that of a mahout or a forest watcher which does not require any specific qualification,” said Mr. Prabhu.

The Ashram schools have no quality checks and the Department of Tribal Welfare is content ensuring timely food and nutrition to the children enrolled.

But education is not its domain and hence the schools should be brought under the Department of Education, argued Mr. Prabhu and Mr. Sreekanth.

The other factors responsible for the high dropout rate, is the medium of instruction. For the tribals, Kannada is as alien as English and hence it is imperative to develop modules and lessons to impart lessons in their respective mother tongues. Otherwise the concept of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education will be meaningless for them, according to Mr. Prabhu.

With the State Budget set to be tabled in the first week of March, a fresh attempt will be made to reach out to the government to highlight the predicament of the tribal students and seek policy changes for their betterment.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ar5swm/article30813976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGMYSSCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/activists-highlight-functioning-of-ashram-schools/article30813977.ece

“We will discuss what we can do within our limits. We will also discuss the issue with opposition parties on the measures that need to initiated in this regard,” he told presspersons after a meeting with farmers in the Vidhana Soudha.

“The State government has always stood for the cause of Kannada and Kannadigas. Ours is a pro-Kannada government and we want things to be favourable for Kannadigas. The demand for more job opportunities to Kannadigas is not unreasonable,” he said.

Stating that he had met farmers from across the State and held discussions regarding agriculture and irrigation, the Chief Minister said: “I have discussed these issues for over three hours with farmers and have given a patient hearing to their problems. I will try my best to incorporate their demands in the budget.”

The farmers submitted a memorandum with 68 demands to the Chief Minister requesting that they be considered in the budget.

The demands include fair price for their produce, complete waiver of old loans and disbursal of new loans, ₹25,000 per acre drought relief to affected farmers, online trading facility in all APMCs, and initiation of legal measures for the time bound implementation of Kalasa Banduri project, Yettinahole, K.C.

Their love for Lakshadweep delicacies made the three youngsters set up a humble outlet on Valentine’s Day last year. Celebrating its first anniversary on Friday, ‘Lak Dives’ on Kottaram Road here is now a favourite spot for those who have already fallen in love with Lakshadweep goodies.

Hamdulla Mohammed and F.M. Noushad, two students from Lakshadweep, and their Palakkad friend Nihal Parambil started off their venture mainly to test their entrepreneurship skills and in the hope of generating some additional income to support their studies.

While Mr. Mohammed and Mr. Nihal continue pursuing MEd on the Calicut University campus, their friend Nihal, who completed his master’s degree in Folklore Studies last year, has taken up the management of Lak Dives.

“We bring the goodness of Lakshadweep to Kerala with 20 exclusive products, including marine and coconut-based items. When we started our venture here on a 700 sq. ft. space, we were just students. Now, we have built a strong customer base so as to generate a net profit of at least ₹50,000,” says Mr. Nihal.

The products have an international market too, which has inspired the trio to set up their own production unit on the Island with government support.

‘Sarbath’ festival

To pep up the anniversary celebrations, the youths launched a five-day ‘sarbath’ festival on Friday featuring 49 items, including eight cold beverages, with unique names in the Island language.

Akkini Ikkini, Chankuneeri, Kunji Thiritti, Kithikili, and Basrakolli are some of the most sought-after items on the list, priced between ₹25 and ₹100. Dweep Surka was one of the exclusive sarbath items sold on Friday.

The product list at Lak Dives will soon see the delicious addition of octopus pickle.

148,2020/02/14,‘No database of land ceiling cases’,"Delay in acquisition of surplus land of 1,588.04 ha in 5 districts

The Revenue and Disaster Management Department does not have a taluk wise database of land ceiling cases, exempted land, declared/ acquired surplus land, and surplus land to be assigned.

In a report for the revenue sector for the year ended March 2018, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) noted that the department could only provide a consolidated progress report on taluk wise ceiling cases and surplus land.

A database is crucial for identification, protection, and utilisation of surplus land, the CAG pointed out in the report tabled in the Assembly.

In 43 of the 89 Sub-Registrar Offices in Kasaragod, Kottayam, Malappuram, Palakkad, and Wayanad selected for the audit by the CAG, 184 registered documents for 6.07 ha, involving 5,192.41 ha and valued at ₹311.35 crore, were not identified by the Revenue Department for initiating land ceiling cases.

Fair value

Land in excess of the ceiling limit was not reported by the department while accepting land tax payment details in respect of holdings above 6.07 ha in 358 of the 372 cases involving 12,574.51 ha.

The audit found that no ceiling case was initiated in 114 cases involving 2,141.73 ha valued at ₹499.44 crore as per fair value out of the 197 cases reported by the Taluk Office to the respective Taluk Land Board as having land in excess of the ceiling.

A joint inspection of the audit team with representatives of taluk and village offices found that violations of exemption of 239.10 ha, valued at ₹189.73 crore as per fair value, remain undetected.

The Alappuzha bypass project will materialise by April-end, Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran has said. He was speaking after visiting Kuthirapanthy where a rail overbridge (ROB) will be constructed as part of the project.

Earlier, the bypass project had come to a halt after a delay in getting permission from Railways to place girders for constructing two ROBs at Malikamukku and Kuthirapanthy.

After inspecting the girders, Railways recommended structural changes and denied permission for starting the work. After several months of delay, changes were made in the girders as per the direction of the railway authorities.

Five girders installed

Last month, Railways had given permission for placing girders at Malikamukku. Following this, five girders were installed.

However, girders are yet to be installed at Kuthirapanthy with contractors awaiting permission from Railways. “Once Railways grant permission, the work will be completed without delay,” Mr. Sudhakaran said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a73l3x/article30824401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15tval3--bypass,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/alappuzha-bypass-to-be-ready-in-april/article30824396.ece
150,2020/02/14,Tipper lorries strike terror on Pathanamthitta roads,"Two pedestrians fatally trapped under overturned lorries

Tipper lorries and other heavy vehicles are posing a major threat to pedestrians and motorists on the roads of Pathanamthitta district. Road accidents have claimed many lives and left many seriously injured of late.

Speeding and drunk driving are to be primarily blamed for the accidents. Two pedestrians were killed and three others injured in two separate incidents involving speeding tipper lorries in the district on Wednesday alone.

In one case, a speeding tipper lorry had knocked down a pedestrian and crashed into a residential compound at Ezhumattoor on the Mallappally-Cherukolpuzha road around 3.45 a.m.

Local people came to know about the man fatally trapped beneath the lorry only late in the morning.

Another earth-laden tipper lorry had knocked down a pedestrian and tumbled into a wayside ditch, leaving the victim buried under the loose earth from the overturned vehicle.

The villagers came to know of the pedestrian trapped beneath the lorry only after a few hours.

P.D. Sunilbabu, Special Officer of Safe Kerala project, and P.D. Sukumaran, former Deputy Transport Commissioner, are of the opinion that the rising number of road accidents is due to rash driving by drivers of private and KSRTC buses, tipper lorries, and other heavy vehicles.

‘Road is for all’

“All road users should remember that road is to be shared amongst all and that they should abide by the traffic rules and signals,” they said. “In Kerala, more than half of the road accident victims are in the age group of 20 to 55 years, the key wage-earning and child-raising age group. The loss of the breadwinner in the household due to death or disability can be catastrophic, leading to lower living standards and even poverty,” Mr. Sukumaran said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qwm86r/article30824383.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15tvpt-tipperlorry1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tipper-lorries-strike-terror-on-pathanamthitta-roads/article30824384.ece
151,2020/02/14,Superintendent of hospital suspended,"Allegations of service rules violations

The Health Department has suspended Saiju Hameed, superintendent, Government Victoria Hospital, Kollam, pending inquiry, following allegations of administrative lapses and violation of service rules. The department had received complaints about Dr. Hameed’s unscientific scheduling of hospital shifts and his foreign tours without permission from the government. Allegedly, his posts in social media questioned government policies and criticised the Aardram project.

An inquiry conducted by Health Additional Director (Vigilance) found that he had misused his office and undertaken several foreign trips without the permission of his superiors. According to the report, no staff meeting was conducted in the hospital for long and cleaning staff with no required qualification was appointed as data entry operator. The report says during his overseas trips, he attended conferences displaying the national flag.

He included the name of an organisation in a banner used for an event conducted by the Health Department without permission. Moreover, national flag was seen superimposed and inverted in the banner, an act that amounts to sedition, says the report.

152,2020/02/14,Caution against rising temperatures,"Heat up by 2 to 4 degrees Celsius in Alappuzha, Kottayam, Kannur, Kasaragod

If February is any indication, the State could be in for a sweltering summer this year. Although the summer season is technically still weeks away, the rising mercury has prompted the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to issue ‘maximum temperature warnings’ for several districts.

On Friday, IMD’s Meteorological Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, had warned that both Friday and Saturday could be warmer than the normal by two to four degrees in Alappuzha, Kottayam, Kannur, and Kasaragod districts.

The heat alert has prompted the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) to put out an advisory on precautions against sunburn and sunstroke. The elderly, children and pregnant women have been asked to avoid direct sunlight between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. It being the exam season, schools have been advised to ensure adequate drinking water supply and keep the class rooms airy.

On Thursday, the maximum temperature in Alappuzha was 4.6 degrees Celsius above the normal (37.3oC), while Kannur reported 3.9oC above normal (37.3oC). Kottayam also experienced a warm Thursday with the daytime temperature recorded at 3.5oC above normal (37oC).

Reason cited

“By definition, January and February are winter. But for some years now, we have been experiencing rising temperatures by the middle of February,” K. Santhosh, Director, Met Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, said. He attributed the phenomenon to the dry winds blowing in from neighbouring States. “The temperatures rise when they become strong north-easterlies,” he added.

The records for daytime temperatures for the months of January and February have already been reset in many places in the State, show IMD data. This year, five stations under Met Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, had pipped all-time records for hot days for the month of January.

On January 25, Alappuzha recorded a maximum temperature of 37.3oC, breaking the previous record of 36.7oC reported on January 29, 1998. On January 23, 24, and 25 this year, Kottayam recorded 37oC. The previous highest was 36.6oC (January 30, 2007). Kannur clocked 36.8oC on January 23 breaking the previous record of 36.7oC (January 19, 1991).

CIAL Kochi reported a maximum temperature of 37.1oC on January 23 this year. The previous highest was 36.1oC reported on January 30, 2017, and January 15 and 16, 2018. Vellanikkara in Thrissur reported 35.9oC on January 31, breaking the previous record of 35.7oC (January 25, 2017).",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/caution-against-rising-temperatures/article30824340.ece
153,2020/02/14,ISO approval for 11 rail stations,"In recognition of environmental management system in Palakkad Division

Eleven railway stations in Palakkad Railway Division have won ISO recognition for environmental management. Divisional Railway

Manager Pratap Singh Shami gave away the certificates to the stations heads at a function held here on Thursday.

Additional Divisional Railway Manager D. Sai Baba, Chief Medical Superintendent V. Kalarani, and Environment and Housekeeping Manager A. Suresh were present.

The stations that got the ISO tag are Kasaragod, Kanhangad, Payyannur, Kannur, Thalassery, Vadakara, Koyilandy, Tirur, Mangaluru Central, Mangaluru Junction and Kozhikode.

Kozhikode was the first station in Palakkad division to get ISO certification for environmental management system.

Railway officials said here that introduction of mechanised cleaning at stations and bio-toilets on trains had greatly enhanced the cleanliness. Discharging of human excreta on tracks could be stopped completely with the introduction of bio-toilets.

Enforcement of cleanliness is also in practice at railway stations and other railway premises by imposing penalties. Those dirtying the station premises are slapped penalties ranging from ₹200 to ₹1,500.

For three years

The ISO certification will be valid for three years. Certified agencies will monitor and audit various cleaning processes at the stations.

The certification process for four more stations, including Palakkad Junction, is currently under way. Railway officials said recognition was expected soon for Ottapalam, Shoranur Junction, Kuttippuram and Palakkad Junction.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/iso-approval-for-11-rail-stations/article30824281.ece
154,2020/02/14,Panel makes suggestions for coastal highway,"Compensation for displaced fishermen and adalats figure among measures

The Estimates Committee of the Assembly has mooted elevated highway in the densely populated areas and compensation for the displaced fishermen taking into account changes in their livelihood and their successive generations while going for the 657-km coastal highway that will traverse nine districts.

Adalats during the time of land acquisition to take into confidence the citizens and clear their apprehensions and social impact assessment study on land acquisition and rehabilitation figure among the series of measures mooted by the estimates committee headed by former Minister and CPI(M) legislator S. Sharma.

Environmental impact assessment study has been recommended if the construction works are to be taken on the fish-breeding places and other areas along the coast.

The Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms will have to be complied with if the construction activities are involved in mangroves, corals and fish-breeding places and permission will have to be sought.

The estimates committee, in its 23rd report, has said the construction of the tetrapod for protecting the proposed highway will have to be included while the Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the coastal highway is being prepared. The long-term safety aspects of the highway should also be ensured.

Study proposed

A scientific study on the road and transportation infrastructure, accident prone stretches in the locality and link roads to the coastal highway has been mooted before finalising the alignment.

The alignment and the project details should be shared with the legislators and the elected representatives of the area and their opinion should be sought by the implementing department.

Steps sought to cut cost

Carriageway of adequate width near the coastal highway should be merged to the alignment of the highway to reduce the cost of the project, displacement and rehabilitation of the people.

The estimates committee has also suggested installation of the street lights along the coastal highway and the contract for the maintenance of the street lights in the agreement.

Planting of trees on both sides of the coastal highway corridors had been mooted to reduce pollution from vehicles.

For the long distance travellers using the coastal highway, the committee has mooted comfort stations and rest places under the Vazhiyooram project of Kerala Tourism. The executing department had been asked to take care to acquire the needed land for such facilities while acquiring land for the project.

The committee has also called for cooperation and coordination between PWD, Revenue, LSG and Ports departments

Aimed at improving the road connectivity of the coastal belt of the State, the proposed coastal highway starts from Poovar in Thiruvananthapuram and ends at Kunjathoor, near Thalapady, in Kasaragod district.

To be constructed at a cost of ₹6,048 crore to be sourced from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), it will traverse Kollam, Alappuzha, Ernakulum, Thrissur, Malappuram, Kozhikode and Kannur districts.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/panel-makes-suggestions-for-coastal-highway/article30824221.ece

A Pampa-bound Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus carrying Sabarimala pilgrims caught fire near Chalakkayam on Friday evening. However, all passengers are safe, according to reliable sources.

The District Transport Officer, Roy Jacob, told The Hindu that the bus was completely destroyed in fire before the Fire and Rescue personnel reached the accident site from Pampa.

Mr. Jacob said the bus used for the chain service between Pampa and Nilackal was carrying pilgrims from Nilackal to Pampa around 7 p.m.

The fire outbreak was reported following a tyre burst when the bus was nearing Chalakkayam in the forests. The driver stopped the bus immediately, facilitating the passengers’ rescue before the fire destroying the vehicle.

Mr. Jacob said there were 75 persons on board and all of them were safe.

Three passengers who had sustained minor burns on their legs were given first aid at the Government Hospital at Pampa later, he said.

156,2020/02/14,Govt. sees bid to sensationalise CAG report,"Chief Secretary says report leaked to media, State Police Chief being unfairly targeted

The State government on Friday appeared to push back on what a senior official termed as an entrenched attempt to sensationalise the CAG's report to target State Police Chief Loknath Behera personally.

Chief Secretary Tom Jose denounced on record “attempts” to single out ""any one officer” for vilification by sensationalising the CAG's report and presenting information in a cherry-picked manner. Mr. Jose, in a veiled comment on the Opposition, wondered how the media had got bits and pieces of the CAG's report before it was tabled in the Assembly.

Congress legislator P.T. Thomas had sought an anti-corruption inquiry against Mr. Behera in the Assembly the previous day by raising some details that subsequently figured in the CAG's report. Mr. Jose said there was credible ground to suspect that at least parts of the report were leaked to media before legislators saw the document.

The Chief Secretary's statement could open the door for the ruling front legislators to petition the Speaker citing breach of parliamentary privilege. Mr. Jose said the audit covered the period between April 2013 and March 2018 and spanned the terms of two governments.

Officials said Mr. Jose felt that the report in the public domain appeared to unfairly suggest that the findings were only for the period of the current government and during the tenure of the present set of officers.

He said that some sections of the media had gone beyond the ambit of the CAG's findings to disparage individual officers personally. Mr. Jose termed the trend unfortunate.

The government had modalities of answering the CAG's queries. The response required processing time. However, the media appeared to have jumped the gun and damned individual officers and portrayed them as wrongdoers. Mr. Jose said such attempts to tar and feather officers ran against the cardinal principles of democracy.

The government would reply to the points raised by the CAG. It would also state its case before the Public Accounts Committee. Mr. Jose said as Chief Secretary he could requisition any government vehicle for his use and commuting to work in a Police Department vehicle was no great wrong.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-sees-bid-to-sensationalise-cag-report/article30823707.ece
157,2020/02/14,"Plant 100 saplings, court tellsIndustries and Commerce Director","Planting of 100 saplings has been prescribed as punishment to the State Industries and Commerce Director for the non-compliance of a court order.

A Single Judge of the Kerala High Court issued the order on a petition filed by a Kollam-based chemical company.

Inordinate delay

The company, which was engaged in the manufacture and sale of carbonated silicate, had moved the court against the inordinate delay on the part of the State Level Committee for Sales Tax exemption to pass final orders on an appeal which was pending before it.

The court had passed an order in 2002 setting aside the order passed by the committee and directing it to consider the case afresh after considering the certificates produced by the company and fixing time limit for the disposal of the appeal. However, the committee failed to act, as ordered by the court, the petitioner submitted.

Peeved about the inaction, the company again approached the court.

When the case came up, the government pleader had submitted that the appeal was listed for hearing on March 17, 2005. Yet the committee did not dispose of the appeal filed by the company.

158,2020/02/14,State apprehensive over Indo-U.S. trade talks,"Sunil Kumar writes to Centre seeking safeguards for farmers

Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar has shot off a letter to Union Minister for Commerce Piyush Goyal outlining the State's apprehensions regarding the Indo-U.S. trade talks that are underway.

In a two-page letter on Friday, Mr. Sunil Kumar urged the Union Minister to safeguard the interests of Indian farmers, drawing his attention to the recent outpouring of protest against the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

Lauding the Centre's decision to opt out of the RCEP agreement last year, Mr. Sunil Kumar warned that Indian farmers could never expect a level playing field with their U.S. counterparts. The U.S. farmers benefited from the land-holding patterns of that country as well as advanced production techniques and direct and indirect subsidies, he pointed out.

Mr. Sunil Kumar's letter should be seen against the backdrop of the concerns raised by farmer organisations at the national level over the U.S. trade deal. The Minister had also raised the issue in the State Assembly earlier this week.

Mr. Sunil Kumar reminded Mr. Goyal that India had banned the import of certain pulses to check the fall in prices of domestic produce, a regulatory measure that had not gone down well with countries such as the U.S., Canada and Australia.

On no account should India agree to demands for unconditional market access for U.S. meat and dairy products, Mr. Sunil Kumar said. Indian meat and dairy products are of better quality in addition to possessing the distinction of deriving them from animals reared on feed of natural origin, he said.

Kerala had been in the forefront of the agitations against the RCEP agreement last year. In October, the Kerala Assembly had unanimously passed a resolution demanding the Centre to withdraw from signing the RCEP pact, a free trade agreement (FTA) involving 16 nations including China in the Asia-Oceania region.

The LDF government, supported by the Opposition UDF, had also organised a public convention in Thiruvananthapuram as part of registering the State's objections to the FTA.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-apprehensive-over-indo-us-trade-talks/article30823241.ece
159,2020/02/14,"Police reviewing arms, ammunition stock","DIG, Armed Police Battalion, heading the survey

The State police are conducting a full-scale audit of arms and ammunition in their possession.

Officials said DIG, Armed Police Battalion, was heading the survey.

It had reportedly commenced when the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) asked the police to account for the “shortage” of 24 INSAS 5.56 mm assault rifles and 12,061 rounds in an audit query.

The survey would cover firearms stored in police facilities across Kerala, sidearms of officers, SWAT units, commandos and police personnel assigned on VIP guard duty. The police hope to complete the process by year-end.

CAG’s conclusion

The CAG’s conclusion that police armoury was short of 25 rifles and rounds had stung the police. It had prompted the Opposition to demand a National Investigation Agency (NIA) enquiry citing security implications.

The police had responded, somewhat belatedly, by stating the weapons were in safe custody in Thrissur camp.

The CAG reportedly did not factor in the police response because officers could not allegedly produce the physical evidence before the auditors.

The police had dispersed the weapons from the arms depot at the SAP camp here in 2011. Officials said poor record-keeping had prompted the CAG to conclude the police had mislaid the rifles and bullets.

SPC meets Governor

Meanwhile, State Police Chief Loknath Behera and Special Advisor Raman Sreevastava met Governor Arif Muhammed Khan at the Raj Bhavan on Thursday.

They reportedly said the police had used Modernisation of Police Forces (MoPF) funds to purchase a bulletproof vehicle for VIPs with Z plus category security as per the Centre’s guidelines.

The police had gone for the cheapest option in the market. Officers often had to rely on bulletproof vehicles borrowed from neighbouring States or those flown in from New Delhi for VIP security.

The police had procured vehicles for officers using modernisation funds with the explicit sanction of the State government, and there was no illegal diversion of resources as alleged widely.

The CAG had found that 15% of the 269 vehicles procured by the police were luxury cars for officers and not for operational units. It stated the purchases had violated MoPF guidelines.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/police-reviewing-arms-ammunition-stock/article30823155.ece
160,2020/02/14,Kerala seeks Tamil Nadu’s help to tide over milk crisis,"Milma is aiming at a daily supply of one lakh litres from the neighbouring State

Kerala is looking to Tamil Nadu for milk supplies to address an unexpected shortage that has hit the Kerala Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd. (Milma) in the run-up to the 2020 summer.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had agreed to take up the matter with his Tamil Nadu counterpart Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Animal Husbandry Minister K. Raju said on Friday.

Milma is eyeing a daily supply of one lakh litres from Tamil Nadu to tide over the looming crisis. Milma managing director Patil Suyog Subhashrao will meet representatives of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Limited (Aavin) in Chennai on Monday.

Milma procures approximately 12 lakh litres daily. The demand-supply gap was being met by supplies from the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF). However, KMF had capped the supply at one lakh litres from February 1, leaving Milma in a fix.

“We are in talks with Tamil Nadu. This is a precautionary measure to avert a crisis. We are giving priority to procurement from the milk federation in Tamil Nadu. Milk purchases from private players will be a last resort,” the Animal Husbandry Minister told The Hindu.

Meanwhile, Milma is exploring the possibility of procuring an additional 50,000 litres from Karnataka. The request has been placed before the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), Milma chairman P. A. Balan said.

Demand-supply gap

“After the reduction in supply from Karnataka, we are now getting around 95,000 litres a day. This plus supplies from Tamil Nadu should help us fill the demand-supply gap in the State,” Mr. Balan said.

Meet held

Top Milma officials, including the chairman, managing director and heads of three regional milk producers unions, had met the Animal Husbandry Minister on Thursday to discuss the situation.

161,2020/02/14,CPI(M) sees political motive behind CAG report row,"‘Selective leak aimed at putting govt. in the dock ahead of local body elections’

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] leadership is understood to have reached a broad understanding against going overboard on the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report that questioned the probity in procurement as part of the police modernisation programme.

Sources akin to the developments told The Hindu that the leadership, though had chosen to exercise restraint and decided to wait till the official procedures on the report were completed in its natural course, felt that the selective leak of certain parts of the report was politically motivated and aimed at putting the government in the dock ahead of the local body elections.

In the normal course, the report after tabling in the Assembly would be examined by the Public Accounts Committee. It would seek details on the audit observations from the department concerned and prepare an action taken report. The committee with V.D. Satheesan as chairman has 10 members, three United Democratic Front (UDF) and the remaining Left Democratic Front (LDF).

The party leadership is learnt to have concluded that most of the objections raised in the report are technical and will not have any bearing on the government. The leaks as well as the row over the report are being likened to the manner in which crucial and confidential information regarding the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) were leaked out.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, while replying to the allegation against the police in the Assembly, had said that action on the CAG report would be taken in the normal course. The party leadership had adopted a similar stance, but had taken seriously the leakage of portions of the report to the Opposition. Some of the issues that figured in the report were raised by P.T. Thomas on the floor of the House ahead of tabling it.

Such developments prompted the CPI(M) leadership to conclude that the moves were politically motivated and that the row would die down once the departments concerned furnished the reply to the audit objections, sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cpim-sees-political-motive-behind-cag-report-row/article30822422.ece

This was in violation of the Right to Education Act Section 21 that laid down that school management committees should be set up in all schools, except unaided schools that did not receive any kind of aid or grant from the government or the local authority to meet their expenses.

Digital magazines of over 2,000 schools in the State have been published on the School Wiki portal for public viewing. The Little KITEs IT clubs of Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) have created the digital magazines and uploaded them on www.schoolwiki.in. The entire set of magazines for this year can be viewed district-wise on the ‘Digital Magazine’ link on the portal.

School Wiki, designed on the Wikipedia model, is the largest educational repository among all regional languages in India and includes over 15,000 schools in the State. It features the complete literary works of students in the State School Arts Festivals from 2017 and digital magazines from 2019 onwards.

How to access

Apart from School Wiki homepage, the magazines will also appear on the respective school’s page, with a thumbnail image of its cover page. To view the magazines, one needs to click on the name of the magazine or select the name of the school. The inauguration of school magazines was organised in schools in memory of writer Vaikom Mohammed Basheer on his birth anniversary in January.

The initiative is part of a language computing module in the Little KITEs programme, as part of which students are taught Malayalam typing and word processing. Raster and vector image editing are taught as part of graphic designing.

The articles from students and teachers are typed by the Little KITEs members and a layout is prepared. Libre Office word processor and Gimp and Inkscape, all of which are FOSS (free and open source software) applications, are used for this. The magazines, which feature stories, poems, and articles, are supplemented by pictures and graphics.

The digital format provides an opportunity for people around the globe to access these magazines. It is the first time in India that digital magazines are made available on a public domain on such a large scale.

The initiative throws up a new way to create and present content in a paperless and cost-effective manner, says KITE Chief Executive Officer K. Anvar Sadath.

165,2020/02/14,Spit at your peril in Sulthan Bathery town,"₹500 fine for spitting in public places in town

The Sulthan Bathery municipal council is set to score another first again. After bagging the cleanest tag for the hill town, the civic body is gearing up to make it the first non-spitting zone in the State.

“The Sulthan Bathery municipal council will slap a fine of ₹500 from Saturday on first-time offenders as per Section 341 of the Kerala Municipalities Act. The same fine will be imposed for blowing nose, open urination, and open defecation in the municipal town and public places,” says municipal chairman T.L. Sabu.

The civic body has already started imposing a fine between ₹250 and ₹25,000 for littering and dumping waste in the town. “The council in January decided to ban spitting, open urination, and open defecation in the town, public places, parks and streets under the municipality.”

Awareness drive

“We have sensitised the public with the support of Kudumbashree workers, traders’ organisations, students, trade unions and social media on the significance of making the town a non-spitting zone,” Mr.Sabu says.

“We have cleaned many spitting spots in the town and erected billboards warning offenders,” he says, adding that paan vendors and others have been warned that they would be booked if paan stains are found near their outlets.

Special squads comprising health inspectors, policemen, and activists have been constituted to detect offenders. The government recently issued a circular to avoid spitting in public places to maintain respiratory hygiene in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, Mr. Sabu says.

HC intervention

Though most civic bodies in the State have prohibited spitting in public places and prescribed penalties, it remains mostly on paper. Spitting and blowing nose in public places have been banned in the State following the intervention of the High Court in 2006 but it largely remains unobserved.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/1axodd/article30813965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvwyspitfreesulthanbathery1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/spit-at-your-peril-in-sulthan-bathery-town/article30813960.ece
166,2020/02/14,Fire sweeps through high ranges of Kottayam,"Extreme heat and spells of dry wind render forest fringes on hillsides vulnerable

After a series of low-intense landslips that rocked the region during the monsoon, the vast swaths of forests, grasslands, and plantations in the high ranges of Kottayam have now been taken over by numerous wind-driven fires, giving local residents and firefighting officials sleepless nights.

According to officials with the Fire and Rescue Services, the fast-moving flames, accompanied by extreme heat and spells of dry wind, have turned the forest fringes on the foothills of the Western Ghats incandescent.

The sharp rise in fire incidents over the last couple of weeks has left the 250-plus Fire and Rescue Services personnel and the 16 fire tenders across the eight fire stations in Kottayam stretched to their limit.

A fire that broke out at Moonnilavu two days ago has so far destroyed crops in over 300 acres.

This is in addition to the embers on the hilltops being reported from Myladumpara, near Pala, and the Vattapara forest area near Erumely, among others.

“The fires have left the forests and plantations reduced to charred stumps in many locations. Despite concerted efforts involving our personnel and the public, the fire has found unexpected ways to persist,” said Shinoy, district fire officer, Kottayam.

Inaccessible areas

According to him, the incidents reported from the desolate grasslands on the hilltops are tough to handle, considering the difficulty in deploying personnel and machines at such locations. With a few more months left for the rainy season, officials now expect the number of distress calls to go up further. The department has now chalked out a plan of action to coordinate its firefighting actions with local bodies by constituting committees at the grassroots level.

Taking a serious note of the situation, the Fire and Rescue Services plans to kick-start an awareness campaign in association with the administration. “The situation has been brought to the notice of the Kottayam District Collector. Directives will be issued though the authority regarding the creation of fire lines and clearing of dry shrubs and leaves from plantations to manage flames,” said A.R. Arun Kumar, divisional fire officer.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fire-sweeps-through-high-ranges-of-kottayam/article30813941.ece

A China-returned student who had tested positive for novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection was discharged from the isolation ward of the Government Medical College Hospital, Alappuzha, on Thursday.

Authorities took the decision to discharge him on Wednesday after the latest samples collected from him tested negative for the disease. He will, however, remain under observation at his house till February 26, officials said.

The student who returned from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, was admitted to the hospital on January 30. On February 2, he tested positive for COVID-19. Officials said 139 people were under house quarantine in Alappuzha district as of Thursday evening.

Meanwhile, the Health Department relieved 122 more persons who were on house quarantine as part of the surveillance for COVID-19 in the State.

168,2020/02/14,Five more safe road corridors,"On the lines of similar project on MC Road

Five more model safe corridors, aimed at zero road accidents, are to be created in the State under the Challenge Fund of the Phase II of the World Bank-aided Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP).

The model corridors will be on the lines of the 80-km Vettu Road-Thycode safe corridor demonstration project on the Thiruvananthapuram-Adoor stretch of MC Road. The accident-prone road corridors of Pavangad-Korapuzha in Kozhikode (5.5 km), Thrissur-Kunnamkulam in Thrissur (24.3 km), Vypeen-Munambam in Ernakulam (25 km), Kottiyam-Kundara PWD road in Kollam (11.6 km), and the 5 km Medical College-Kannammoola-Pettah corridor in Thiruvananthapuram are the identified stretches.

The proposals, to replicate the safe corridor model and adopt good practices and proven road safety interventions, from the respective district road safety councils had reached the KSTP office with the nod of the Kerala Road Safety Authority, sources said.

Many new features

Road markings and concepts such as ‘yellow box marking’ on hazardous stretches and ‘right turn protected lane’ for safe right turn on the Vettu Road-Thycode corridor had been lauded.

The sources said the Pavangad-Korapuzha corridor had already been taken up by the KSTP and civil works were in progress. The detailed project report (DPR) for the remaining stretches had been entrusted to the consultants.

On the NH 66 stretch between Pavangad and Korappuzha, multi-sector road safety interventions, including engineering and enforcement-related treatments, at ₹10 crore had been proposed.

On the Medical College-Kannammoola-Pettah section, safe walkway and crossing facilities for pedestrians, safety enhancement in school and hospital zones, bus stops with shelters , improvement of junctions and traffic calming measures, and GPS-enabled emergency vehicle priority system at Kumarapuram Junction would be in place.

On the Kottiyam-Kundara road, accident black-spot improvements, junction improvements, safety enhancement at school zones, road markings and signages, and traffic enforcement cameras had been proposed.

Refurbishing footpath with barrier, surveillance cameras at major junctions with control room and relaying of 25 km of road figure for the Vypeen- Munambam corridor of the State Highway, where 230 accidents resulting in 26 deaths were reported in 2018.

For the Thrissur-Kunnamkulam stretch, the PWD (Roads) had proposed pedestrian footpath, intersection improvement , bus shelters with e-toilet, and speed violation detection cameras.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ac53ns/article30813930.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tv-Safe-corridorscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/five-more-safe-road-corridors/article30813927.ece
169,2020/02/14,Rifles not missing: police,"‘Will answer CAG queries to the Public Accounts Committee’

The State police said on Thursday that the 25 missing assault rifles flagged by the CAG were in safe custody in an Armed Police Battalion camp in Thrissur.

Senior officers said the police had informed the CAG in writing when the audit process was on. However, it appeared not to figure in the final report. The police had issued the weapons to an armed unit based in Thrissur in 2011. The firearms were part of a batch of 660 INSAS 5.56 mm assault rifles. Improper maintenance of records and clerical error had resulted in the misjudgement. The CAG had found 12,061 rounds missing. A bulk of them had not been accounted for since 1994.

An officer said officers could not fully answer for cartridges expended in life fire drills and anti-Maoist operations. The Crime Branch is probing the matter. So far, investigators have found no organised pilferage of live ammunition from any State police facility.

The police hoped to tell the Public Accounts Committee, the final word on audit reports, that it had not violated any norm in the acquisition of bulletproof vehicles for the use of VIPS entitled to Z+ category security.

The police had gone for limited tender and chose the cheapest option available in the open market.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rifles-not-missing-police/article30813923.ece

Vehicular movement was crippled at several places in Chennai and its outskirts on Friday night after members of Islamic outfits staged sporadic protests condemning police for lathicharging a gathering of anti-CAA protesters in Lalagunda in Old Washermanpet. The escalating protests prompted Commissioner of Police A.K. Viswanathan to hold talks with members of the Islamic groups and eventually release nearly 150 protesters.

It all began in the afternoon with close to 1,000 women sitting on a peaceful protest in Lalagunda demanding the withdrawal of the Citizenship Amendment Act. Some protesters claimed that the police asked them to disperse and soon after this 200 men from the locality joined the agitation. “We did not even come to the main road and were protesting on the streets and in front of homes,” a protester claimed.

The situation turned tense around 5.30 p.m. when police swamped the area in hundreds. “They spoke to the protesters and asked them to disperse. As we did not heed to their suggestion, the police used force to chase us away,” he alleged.

Residents claimed the protesters sustained injuries in the melee. “Close to 50 of us were pushed into a bus and detained in a marriage hall,” said a member of Socialist Democratic Party of India (SDPI).

Protesters evicted

Around 8 p.m., the protesters swelled in numbers and began to agitate demanding the release of those who were detained. As they began filling up the narrow streets of the area, refused to budge, the police began removing them forcibly.

The confrontation led to tension, chaos and scuffle. Some policemen were seen beating up and kicking the protesters as they were taken to the police vehicle. There was stone throwing, which was quickly brought under control, said the police.

B. Vijayakumari, Joint Commissioner of Police, West, sustained injuries in the melee. She was rushed to a hospital for treatment.

After a while, the police held back and the organisers conducted talks with senior police officers.

Police assurance

Later in the night, Islamic leaders told the protesters that the police had given assurance that all those arrested would be released and asked the crowd to disperse.

Mr. Viswanathan also conducted talks with representatives of Muslim political outfits to address the issue amicably. He later went to the spot to speak to the protesters.

One dies

Meanwhile, the organisers said an elderly man died in his house due to “shock”. Police, however, said the old man was under treatment for a few years and he had nothing to do with the protest.

As news about the man’s death, arrest of the anti-CAA protesters and videos of police assault spread on social media, sporadic protests started erupting in Chennai and elsewhere. Members of Muslim organisations gathered in places like Alandur, Anna Salai, Pudupet, Mannady and other parts of the city to condemn the police attack. Policemen were deployed in large numbers to control the situation.

171,2020/02/14,"On Valentine’s Day, transwoman-man wedding in Coimbatore becomes official​","The 24-year-old man and 23-year-old transwoman had married in a temple two years ago, but had earlier not been able to get their marriage registered

In a first for Coimbatore district and probably the second-ever instance in Tamil Nadu, the marriage of a transwoman and a man from Narasimhanaickenpalayam was formally registered at the sub-registrar office in Vadavalli here on Friday.​

S. Surega, a 23-year-old transwoman and R. Manikandan, a 24-year-old man married at a temple in Kavundampalayam exactly two years ago on February 14, 2018. However, their marriage application made on January 22 was rejected by Vadavalli sub-registrar office, which said in a reply to the couple that the word 'transgender’ “finds no place” in the Hindu Marriage Act.​

This was in contradiction with the April 2019 verdict of the Madurai ‘Bench of Madras High Court, which stated that the world ‘bride’ in the Act would also include transwomen. Hence, on January 27, the couple along with their lawyer P.P. Sivkumar approached the District Registrar Office seeking the registration of their marriage.​

According to Mr. Sivkumar, the petition to the District Registrar Office prompted a response from the Inspector General of Registration Office, Chennai, which clarified to the sub-registrar office that the Act is applicable for transgenders. “This will ensure the legal rights of every transwoman-man couple in Tamil Nadu henceforth,” he told The Hindu on Friday. Mr. Sivkumar said that he was one of the three witnesses for the marriage registration at the Vadavalli sub-registrar Office along with the parents of Mr. Manikandan.​

An official from the Vadavalli sub-registrar office said that the couple visited the office at around 10.30 a.m. and that the entire registration process was completed within 30 minutes. The couple were issued the marriage certificate following the registration, the official noted. There were discrepancies in the date of birth of Mr. Manikandan in the January 22 application, which he had corrected and all the pertinent documents were furnished on Friday, according to the official.​

“I am so happy that I have a fever now!” Ms, Surega told The Hindu over the phone amidst intermittent coughing a few hours after the marriage. The couple are planning to adopt a baby soon, she said. “I hope that our marriage might help others in the future who are in a similar position,” Mr. Manikandan said, expressing happiness that the marriage took place in the presence of his parents.​",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/eq54iq/article30821044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14FEBTH-Trans,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/on-valentines-day-transwoman-man-wedding-in-coimbatore-becomes-official/article30821045.ece
172,2020/02/14,"TN Budget 2020-21: Debt has tripled since DMK regime, says Stalin​","Picking holes in the budget presented by Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam in the Assembly, DMK president and Leader of the Opposition M. K. Stalin on Friday said the State’s debt burden has tripled since 2011 when the DMK demitted office. ​

​While the debt during the erstwhile DMK regime [2006-11] was only about ₹1 lakh crore, it has increased to ₹4.56 lakh crore this time, Mr. Stalin pointed out. Interacting with reporters soon after the House adjourned for the day, Mr. Stalin said: “There is no vision or any development plan in the budget. There is finance deficit and revenue deficit. There is so much debt.”​

​He wondered why more funds have been allocated for the portfolios held by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Ministers P. Thangamani and S.P. Velumani. The DMK president also claimed this would be the last budget presented by the AIADMK government.​

​Taking a dig at Mr. Panneerselvam for having read out his speech for a long time, Mr. Stalin said the AIADMK government was following the steps of the BJP government at the Centre. While Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented her budget speech in the Parliament for about 159 minutes, Mr. Panneerselvam read out his for 196 minutes, he said.​

​Mr. Stalin also took a swipe at Mr. Panneerselvam by referring to the latter’s speech that though there were attempts to dislodge the AIADMK government after its leader Jayalalithaa died in December 2016, “It was Mr. Panneerselvam who ‘meditated’ at his leader’s mausoleum and voted against this government,” he pointed out.​

​Replying to a query on the government’s decision to declare the Cauvery delta region a Protected Special Agriculture Zone (PSAZ), Mr. Stalin said while his party was for it, he wondered whether the State government had powers to do so.​

​Demanding to make public the contents of the Chief Minister’s letter, which was handed over by Minister D. Jayakumar to the Centre in Delhi over the PSAZ, Mr. Stalin warned: “Or else, I would release the letter.” When asked about the Supreme Court’s verdict in the DMK’s plea to disqualify 11 AIADMK MLAs including Mr Panneerselvam, Mr. Stalin hoped the Speaker would take a good decision. ​

175,2020/02/14,"Tamil Nadu Budget 2020-21: Net debt to rise, revenue deficit set to double","UDAY scheme, slower growth in tax revenue drag finances.

Tamil Nadu’s net outstanding debt is expected to rise significantly to over ₹4.56-lakh crore in 2020-21, from ₹3.97-lakh crore projected in 2019-20. The State’s revenue deficit too is set to double compared to the previous projection owing to a host of factors, Deputy Chief Minister and State Finance Minister O. Paneerselvam said, presenting the budget in the Assembly on Friday.

The State’s revenue deficit is likely to double to ₹21, 617.64 crore compared to the projection of ₹10,040.31 crore for the year. However, compared to the revised estimates for 2019-20 it is lower by nearly ₹ 4,000 crore. Even for 2019-20, the revenue deficit is now projected at ₹25,000 crore, an increase of ₹10,000 crore from the earlier estimate, largely due to an “unprecedented” drop of ₹7,586 crore in the State’s share of Central taxes”.

In a budget speech lasting over three hours, Mr. Paneerselvam said the State continued to see a sustained increase in its revenue deficit.

The burden imposed on the State finances by the takeover of debt of Tangedco under the UDAY scheme, the lag effect of the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission and slower growth in tax revenue were the primary reasons for the increase in the revenue deficit.

The rise in the net debt was mainly on account of the State raising ₹59,209.30 crore as net debt to finance the fiscal deficit during 2020-21. The fiscal deficit is estimated to be 2.84% for 2020-21, well below the 3% fiscal norms.

The State’s Own Tax Revenue is estimated to increase to ₹1.33 lakh crore for the year, compared to the revised estimate of ₹1.20 lakh crore for 2019-20.

Finance Secretary S. Krishnan said the 2020-21 budget was prepared taking into to all these factors and has projected just a conservative estimate of growth of 10.5% in tax revenue.

On the State’s debt crossing more than ₹ 4.5 lakh crore (21.83% of GSDP), he said it was well within the permissible limit of 25%. On the continuing trend of the State posting a revenue deficit, Mr. Krishnan said it was because Tamil Nadu spent more on welfare schemes compared to other States, adding that over time this deficit would be brought down.

Revenue expenditure is estimated at about ₹2.41 lakh crore for 2020-21, compared to ₹2.12 crore lakh crore in the revised budget estimate for 2019-20.

Growth lags

Tamil Nadu’s economic growth for 2019-20 is projected to be 7.27%, a fall from 8.17% in 2018-19, Mr Panneerselvam said, attributing it to global and national economic headwinds. However, the State’s growth was higher than the national growth rate of 5%, he said, adding that he expected an even stronger growth performance in the coming year.

The economic slowdown has also hit the State’s tax collection in 2019-20. For instance, collection of taxes on motor vehicles dipped to ₹6,018.63 crore in revised estimates for 2019-20 when compared to previous projections of ₹6,510.70 crore.

“Since motor vehicle tax is primarily levied on registration of vehicles, tax collections in the coming years is expected to be in accordance with improved economic growth prospects,” he said.

Tamil Nadu’s fiscal deficit is estimated to be 2.84% for 2020-21, well below the 3% fiscal norms while the State’s revenue deficit is likely to double to ₹21, 617.64 crore compared to the projection of ₹10,040.31 crore, Deputy Chief Minister and State Finance Minister O. Paneerselvam said.

Presenting the annual State budget for 2020-21 in the State Assembly on Friday, Mr. Panneerselvam said the State continues to see a sustained increase of its revenue deficit. The burden imposed on the State finances by the take-over of debt of Tangedco under the UDAY scheme, the lag effect of the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission, slower growth in tax revenue are causing rise in revenue deficit.

“In order to finance the fiscal deficit during 2020-21, it is estimated that ₹59,209.30 crore will be raised as net debt. Therefore, the net outstanding debt at the end of March 31, 2021, is expected at ₹4,56,660.99 crore,” he said.

The State’s Own Tax Revenue is estimated to increase to ₹1,33,530.30 crore for the year compared to the revised estimate of ₹1,20, 809.63 crore.

Mr. Panneerselvam said the ‘unprecedented’ drop in the share of Central taxes further burdened the State which is already severely affected by the devolution criteria adopted by the 14th Finance Commission.

“Tamil Nadu suffered a serious setback in the Revised Estimates 2019-20 due to the unprecedented reduction in the share of Central Taxes which stands at ₹26,392.40 crore as against ₹33,978.47 crore in the Budget Estimates 2019-20,” he said.

He also said the government will shortly launch a New Industrial Policy which will provide GST regime compatible incentives.

177,2020/02/14,Court refuses to give quietus to DVAC probe against Tamil Nadu Minister Rajenthra Bhalaji,"HC wants to examine validity of exhaustive ‘preliminary probe’

The Madras High Court on Thursday refused to give a quietus to a public interest litigation petition accusing Minister for Milk and Dairy Development K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji of having amassed wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income.

The Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) gave him a clean chit on July 27 and the government decided to drop all further proceedings on August 10.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha were persistent in examining the validity of an exhaustive “preliminary inquiry” conducted by the DVAC without registering a First Information Report against the Minister. The judges wanted senior counsel I. Subramanian and M. Ajmal Khan, representing the Minister, to convince the court whether it was legally permissible to conduct a detailed inquiry in the guise of a preliminary inquiry.

They also wanted to know whether the investigating officer was right in deciding unilaterally that the Minister need not be prosecuted because only less than 10% of his assets were found to be disproportionate to his known sources of income in the preliminary inquiry. They wondered whether it was for the police or the court concerned to apply the benefit of a 1977 Supreme Court verdict, which provides for a permissible variation of less than 10%.

‘No hard and fast rule’

In reply, Mr. Subramanian said there was no hard and fast rule that all preliminary inquiries should be completed within a short span of time and should not be elaborate.

“Though the nomenclature is ‘preliminary inquiry,’ depending upon the nature of a complaint the inquiry could be detailed too. There’s no straitjacket formula. In this case, the inquiry had to be done in detail because the court was seeking status reports periodically.

“What was initially thought of as a preliminary inquiry became a detailed inquiry because of the sequence this case took with this court seeking status reports. Your Lordships had gone through the reports and also gave guidelines. The preliminary inquiry as directed by this court was completed and a report was submitted to the Vigilance Commissioner and it went up to the government. Therefore, now the case should be given a quietus,” he argued.

Claiming that there was no deliberate attempt on the part of DVAC to convert a preliminary inquiry into a detailed inquiry, the senior counsel said voluminous documents and materials that had to be gone through for a very long check period of 22 years had led to the preliminary inquiry turning out to be a detailed inquiry. “There was absolutely no bias. IPS officers had conducted the preliminary inquiry and submitted a report to Vigilance Commissioner,” he pointed out.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ng233t/article30815144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THRAJENTHRA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/court-refuses-to-give-quietus-to-dvac-probe-against-tamil-nadu-minister-rajenthra-bhalaji/article30815145.ece
178,2020/02/14,Woman attacks couple for not returning money; man dies,"Oomerabad police registers case, arrests woman

Police nabbed a woman for murdering her brother-in-law and causing grievous injuries to his wife over a family feud.

Police sources said Murugesan, 53, of Kammakrishnapalli village in Ambur and Venkatesan, 46, were brothers and the latter died a few years ago. Murugesan had borrowed cash from Venkatesan’s wife Chitra, 43, and did not return it. There had been many wordy duels between Chitra and Murugesan over money matters.

On Wednesday, Chitra attacked Murugesan and his wife Vijaya, 48, who were sleeping inside their house. While Murugesan died on the spot due to excess bleeding, Vijaya suffered grievous injuries. Chitra escaped from the spot.

Neighbours who heard the cries rushed to the help of Murugesan and Vijaya, but could not save Murugesan. Oomerabad police rushed to the spot and sent Vijaya to Government Hospital for treatment. Murugesan’s body was sent for post-mortem. Oomerabad police who registered a case arrested Chitra on Thursday.

179,2020/02/14,High Court stays permission for event at Kodaikanal resort,"State government apprehensive that participants might use narcotic substances

After the State expressed apprehension over the conduct of a ‘music, art and food’ festival in a private resort in Poombarai, Kodaikanal, that could involve narcotic substances, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday stayed the permission granted for the event.

After a single judge had allowed the conduct of the event after imposing a series of conditions that included a direction to the private resort, Club India Resorts and Metro Hotels in Kodaikanal to ensure that narcotic substances were not used at the event, the State government preferred an appeal against the order. The State government, in the appeal, said the four-day event scheduled from February 13, was to be held at night.

Given that Poombarai was located within the Anamalai Tiger Reserve and over a 1,000 people expected at the event, it could disturb wildlife. The organisers had not furnished details of people who would be attending the event, the food and drinks would be served and the instruments to be used.

With participants said to be pouring in from other States and abroad for the event, narcotics substances could be involved, the State government apprehended.

It submitted that a temple festival at the village was going on and the private event could disturb the harmony of the festival.

Therefore, the State government sought the single judge order be set aside by taking into account the flora and fauna of the region.

Taking up the appeal for hearing, a Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran granted a stay on the single bench order that permitted the conduct of the event.

The court adjourned the hearing in the case.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-court-stays-permission-for-event-at-kodai-resort/article30814808.ece

181,2020/02/14,HC quashes Government Order prescribing qualifications for SASTA director,"‘Issue notification in accordance with MGNREG Act’

The Madras High Court on Thursday quashed a Government Order issued on May 21 and a consequential notification calling for applications to fill the post of director of Social Audit Society of Tamil Nadu (SASTA) and ordered issuance of a fresh notification after prescribing the qualifications strictly in accordance with the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act of 2005 and the rules framed thereunder.

Justice N. Anand Venkatesh passed the orders while allowing a writ petition filed by S. Sattanathan, who had served as the first Director of SASTA.

Intrusion in autonomy

The judge agreed with senior counsel R. Vaigai, representing the petitioner, that experience in social auditing had not been made mandatory in last year’s recruitment notification and hence it would pave way for government intrusion into the independence and autonomy of SASTA through appointment of bureaucrats.

“It appears from the government order as well as the counter affidavit filed by the Government of Tamil Nadu that an impression is created as if the government is the overall authority of SASTA. In the considered view of this court, an independent Director for SASTA is a very vital factor for effectively implementing the objects of the MGNREG Act, 2005 and Audit of Scheme Rules, 2011. At no point of time, the government or the local body should be given control.

“Till now, the Government of Tamil Nadu has managed to run the Society with the Secretaries and the Additional Secretaries, without appointing an independent Director for Social Audit. From the government order and the notification, it is clear that the government wants to continue to have this control by prescribing such qualifications which will suit the existing or retired bureaucrats.

“There is a clear distinction between a person who has experience in a regular audit and the person who has experience in social audit. If the Director does not possess the experience in social audit, it is not known as to how he will be able to appreciate the social audit report submitted to him,” the judge said and suggested that the State government take a cue from similar appointments made in other States.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-quashes-go-prescribing-qualifications-for-sasta-director/article30814731.ece
182,2020/02/14,Loyola college produces bio-oil formulation,"Repellent effective against major pests

The Entomology Research Institute (ERI), Loyola College, has produced a plant-based pesticide to control fall armyworm, which caused widespread damage to 180 major crops in Tamil Nadu and cotton bollworm.

“It has proved more effective than chemical pesticides. We found its efficacy in the fields in Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Chengalpet districts,” said Fr S. Maria Packiam, SJ, Director of the ERI, who has developed ‘Ponneem’, a natural oil formation for the control of agricultural pests, termites and mosquitoes.

Product patented

Ponneem is a patented product and has pungam and neem oil in equal ratio.

“We have added emulsifier. It has a strong repellent activity. We found after its application the pest insects are not able to eat and lay eggs. The formulation has a detrimental effect on survivors. The insects of the next generation have wing deformities,” said Fr Maria Packiam. Pointing out that chemical pesticides had destroyed honeybees and spiders, the natural pollinators, Fr. Maria Packiam said the chemicals did not spare the bacteria responsible for the decomposition and human beings.

“Farmers who constantly use the chemicals have developed blisters and wounds. The residue of the pesticides found in agricultural products is harmful when consumed,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/2totez/article30814724.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13PONNEEM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/loyola-college-produces-bio-oil-formulation/article30814725.ece
183,2020/02/14,‘Misuse of pesticides to blame for disappearance of pollinators’,"NBAIR director says natural enemies should be allowed to take care of insects

When Chandish R. Ballal, the Director of National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources, did her Ph.D on pigeon pea ecosystem, she found that Campoletis chlorideae, a parasitoid insect, destroyed 20% of the insect pests (parasitism) in plants.

“But today I am not at all finding them, even though in the 1960s, 1970s and in the 1980s, researchers from other centres had recorded between 70 to 80% parasitism. There is a clear reduction in the population of pollinators and parasitoids due to irresponsible use insecticides and chemicals,” she said, addressing the Insect Diversity and Conservation-2020 organised by the Entomology Research Department (ERI), Loyola College, in collaboration with Indian Council of Agricultural Research-National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (ICAR-NBAIR).

She said precise documentation and real quantification of the diversity of insects had to be done to explain to the world about what was happening due to the intensive agriculture practices and irresponsible use of chemicals and insecticides. “We have to do that at least from now. But I am not saying that chemicals should not be used. Use it in a judicious manner. In several cases, the nature is taking care of the parasites. If we understand and allow the insects to be taken care by the natural enemies, we do not have to impose chemical treatment more than what is required,” she said. Ms. Ballal explained how the parasite, Goniozus, used as a biocontrol agent effectively controlled the black-headed caterpillar in coconut trees in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

Biocontrol agents

In Adat panchayat in Kerala, chemicals and pesticides were kept away and instead biocontrol agents were used in paddy on 3000 acres. “The natural ecosystem has come to the scene. Birds and animals are coming back. Otherwise it would have become a desert,” she said.

Asked whether farmers could get the yield without using pesticides, she said if one calculated the amount spent for chemicals and insecticides unnecessarily, the usage of natural biocontrol and augmented biocontrol farmers could save money.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/misuse-of-pesticides-to-blame-for-disappearance-of-pollinators/article30814702.ece
184,2020/02/14,HC says no to slapping of criminal defamation cases against media houses,"Quashes GOs issued to prosecute two dailies during Jayalalithaa’s tenure

Criminal defamation cases cannot be slapped by the State against media houses even for having published interviews and statements issued by politicians trading charges against those in power for acts performed by the latter purely in their personal capacity and without any reference to discharge of public functions, the Madras High Court has held.

Justice M. Dhandapani ruled so while quashing two Government Orders, issued in September 2014, for prosecuting the Resident Editor and branch head of an English newspaper and the publisher of a Tamil daily for having published the contents of a letter written by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In the letter, Mr. Swamy had claimed that the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa was rattled by his success in getting Indian fishermen released from Sri Lanka. He also accused her of appropriating all his achievements on issues related to Mullaperiyar dam, installation of Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar’s statue in Parliament and the 2G spectrum scam.

“The sum and substance of the above clearly reveal that the statements, which are alleged to be defamatory, are not against any public function discharged by the said individual in her official capacity but it is a criticism levelled against Dr. Jayalalithaa in her personal capacity. The print media has simply carried the statements made by Dr. Swamy.

“The petitioners (printers and publishers) have not imputed any allegations or made false accusations against Dr. Jayalalithaa nor against the public office held by the individual. Rather, it is clear not only from a reading of the news item published by the petitioners, but also the extracted portion in the Government Orders, that it is a personal criticism,” the judge said.

He recalled that the Supreme Court in R. Rajagopal versus State of Tamil Nadu (1994) had held that while defending defamation cases, it would be enough for members of the press or media to prove that they had acted after a reasonable verification of the facts and that it was not necessary for them to prove that their content was nothing but truth.

Allowing three writ petitions challenging the GOs, the judge said: “The action of the State in initiating prosecution against the petitioners for their act of publishing the statement of Dr. Swamy is a direct invasion into the right of freedom of speech and expression which cannot be curtailed by invocation of Section 499 (criminal defamation) of Indian Penal Code.

“Recognising the freedom of the press to bring to the people the happenings in and around them is the fulcrum of a democratic functioning of the State. Clogging the said system by curtailing the freedom is nothing but a direct invasion on the freedom enshrined in Article 19 (1) of the Constitution.

“While it is the duty of the court to safeguard the interests of those holding public office from being defamed for discharge of their public functions, equally, the citizens have also to be safeguarded from malicious prosecution by the State machinery.”

Justice Dhandapani also took strong exception to the two GOs having been issued within 24 hours of the publication of the news articles. “The sanction for prosecution, according to this court, has been granted at such a pace in which haste cannot be ruled out. Haste could also be concomitant to non-application of mind.

“Application of mind in grant of sanction is a foremost necessity. However, the speed with which the sanction for prosecution has been granted leaves not only a lot to be said but equally leaves a bitter taste, however, exercising judicial restraint, this court restrains itself from elaborating it any further.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-says-no-to-slapping-of-criminal-defamation-cases-against-media-houses/article30814690.ece

It was entertainment laced with social messages on patriotism and brotherhood, that enthralled the audience on Thursday — day two of Riviera 2020 — the annual international sports and cultural event organised by the students of Vellore Institute of Technology.

‘Aikya’ (integration), presented a glimpse of the cultures and traditions of the different states of India. Students of Vellore Institute of Technology hailing from various states of the country brought home the concept of national integration through music, dance and martial arts.

Students from various states who performed in Aikya marched in front of the audience displaying the name of their State depicting the oneness among all citizens of India.

Students from Punjab performed Bhangra, the traditional dance of the State performed by Punjabi farmers to celebrate the harvest season. Lavani, Koli and Dhangar dances were performed to the rhythm of lezim and beats of Dhol Tasha and Dhwaj, by the students from Maharashtra.

Students from Tamil Nadu presented a splendid performance of several folk artforms— Mayilattam, Thappattam, Silambam and other martial arts. The team from Andhra Pradesh performed Kuchupudi and Kolatam. The student group from Assam presented their traditional Bihu dance.

Through dance, the students from Delhi showcased the history of the national capital as an interesting and grand city. The group from Haryana presented their traditional dance forms (classical and folk) — Ghoomar, Gangaur and Khoria.

Team Jammu & Kashmir performed Dumhal, the dance form of the Wattal tribe. The Karnataka team performed Hulivesha or the tiger dance and various folklore performances from the State.

The Kerala team equally enthralled the audience with various dance forms and theatrical performances like Daffumuttu, Mohiniyattam, Kerala Natanam, tribal folk, thiruvathira, appana, etc.

A programme that caught the attention of many students was ‘Sahiti’ organised by the Telugu Club of VIT. The students blended a social message in a casual dance and song.

Earlier in the day, folk artistes gave an exemplary performance in ‘Karagattam’, ‘Oyilattam’, and ‘Puli Vesham’, and it stole the hearts of the participating students, faculties and guests present on the occasion.

VIT Chancellor G. Viswanathan inaugurated ‘Aikya’ in the presence of vice-president of VIT Sankar Viswanathan, assistant vice-president Kadhambari S. Viswanathan and pro vice chancellor S. Narayanan.

187,2020/02/14,Resealed bundles did not arouse suspicion: TNPSC Secretary K. Nanthakumar,"‘We did not get material evidence in Group-II initially’

The sensational Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) examination scam has raised questions about the involvement of insiders and the delay in detecting the fraud. TNPSC Secretary K. Nanthakumar in an interview says the scam went unnoticed as the answer script bundles were resealed. Excerpts:

It appears the TNPSC Group IV exam scam would have remained under wraps had it not been exposed on social media..

TNPSC has several departments, each involved in a specific task. The idea is to keep one department in the dark about what the other department is up to and it is intentional. So, other departments did not check on the exam conducting department.

There were complaints about malpractice in Group II exam also but the TNPSC acknowledged it much later. Why?

Unlike the evidences we got in Group-IV, we did not get material evidence in Group-II initially. Also, since we were involved in probing the Group-IV exam, we could not hold parallel probe into Group-II exams. Once we handed over the case to the CB-CID, we went after the Group-II exam.

Did the TNPSC not learn its lessons from the leakage of its Group I paper in 2015?

No. In 2015, the answer sheets went to persons who did not appear in examinations at all. But, in Group-IV exams the sheets went only to the candidates. So, there is a difference. You cannot compare the two cases.

Has the TNPSC taken any action against its officials?

The record clerk Omkanthan and a typist have been arrested by the CB-CID and suspended. Since they re-sealed the bundles after the malpractice, the TNPSC could not detect that the answer sheets were doctored.

How did you zero in on the 99 candidates, who used evaporating ink? Was a ultra-blue test done to find out if invisible ink was used?

We checked the answer sheets of about 25,000 candidates who were selected for the second stage. Through the test, we zeroed in on these 99 candidates. We did the ultra-blue test on the answer sheets ourselves and no other agency was involved.

Also, there is an issue in the quota for Persons Studied in Tamil Medium (PSTM) on who should be the beneficiaries of this quota…

Yes, the law says the candidate should have studied in Tamil medium in qualifying exams. But, we see many candidates are doing some correspondence course only to get into this quota. So, we have requested the government to amend the law to make it in such a way that candidates should have studied in Tamil medium in Class 10 and Class 12 and also in graduation. The amendment may be made any time.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rf3rvy/article30814281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THNANTHAKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/resealed-bundles-did-not-arouse-suspicion-tnpsc-secretary/article30814282.ece

189,2020/02/14,‘Naan Sirithal’ movie review: Funny... in bits and pieces,"In the hands of a wise head, this script held the potential to be developed into an epic, Ray Cooney style, comedy-of-errors

Naan Sirithal is an interesting offering from Tamil cinema.

The premise of the story, which revolves around Gandhi’s (Hip Hop Adhi) inability to control his laughter when faced with an uncomfortable situation, offers great promise.

In the hands of a wise head, this script held the potential to be developed into an epic, Ray Cooney style, comedy-of-errors. Instead what we are left with is a film which engages you only in moments because Raana, the debutant filmmaker, misses the woods for the trees.

The plot is plain vanilla. Gandhi develops a “nervous laughter” syndrome after sitting for an engineering arrears paper.

Still only 30, it may take a while before Adhi manages to steer clear of playing roles where he is an engineering student or his character references the field or study of engineering. We get it. Engineering is tough, there are no jobs for graduate engineers. Can we discuss something that is not so 2011?

Gandhi falls in love with an HR person in his office, Ankitha (played by Iswarya Menon, and who looks like Samantha Akkineni and Shruti Haasan rolled into one). But Adhi is a middle class boy and Ankitha’s parents are against their marriage.

Now, if the rest of the film was just about his escapades and attempts to convince his girlfriend’s parents, the movie could have had a more complete story arc.

Naan Sirithal Director: Raana

Cast: Adhi, Iswarya Menon, KS Ravikumar, Ravi Mariya, Munishkanth, Sha Ra and others

Storyline: A man who struggles to contain his laughter, when subjected to situations that induce fear or sadness, gets caught in the middle of a gang war that ends up in a comedy of errors.

Instead, we get a gang war and two baddies — KS Ravikumar playing Dilli Babu, and Ravi Mariya playing Sakkara Das. Only one of them is convincing enough as a funny bad guy, and it is Mariya considering his track record in films like Velainu Vandhutta Vellaikaaran. How Gandhi prevails over all these characters forms the rest of the plot.

Adhi shows signs of maturing as a performer. Histrionics aside, as Gandhi, he is able to coax a smile here and a laugh there. It could well be the ‘Friends syndrome’ at play, where we watch Vijay laughing uncontrollably at Vadivelu’s plight, and which somehow forces us to let out an extra few seconds of uninhibited laughter for no particular reason.

A few of the comedy scenes work due to its slapstick execution. What doesn’t work is the many parallel narratives and emotions weaved into the script. Gandhi is, at the same time, a funny guy, someone whom we should laugh at, take pity with, feel affectionate about, listen to for his wisdom and much more. That makes Gandhi someone we just could not care about. His suffering does not elicit sympathy out of us.

The film’s loose staging, starting with the protagonist going into a flashback storytelling sequence that lasts over two hours after being invited to appear as a guest on a television show, and amateur writing (the lead pair’s romance, KS Ravikumar’s dialogues), doesn’t help its cause.

The same television programme is then turned into a platform for the lead actor to present his ‘message’ to the audience. Interestingly though, it is not all preaching from a pedestal.

Adhi, or Gandhi, turns the finger on him, and, in turn, symbolically, on the rest of us, and goes on to say something that, I believe, is closest to being a criticism of the divisive politics happening in the national arena.

Other than that, Naan Sirithal is that film which you will remember the most for its few genuinely funny sequences, when it is played on loop by 24/7 comedy channels.

190,2020/02/14,"Kalyani Priyadarshan: 'The Malayalam industry is like family, because my family is deeply rooted here'","The actor on 'Varane Avashyamund', the pressures that come with being a 'star kid' and she was afraid of getting into Malayalam films

Kalyani Priyadarshan looks a tad nervous about doing a solo interview with an FM radio station as post-release promotions of Varane Avashyamund are on. “Will Anoop (Sathyan) ettan be there? Or Dulquer?” she asks. She is refreshingly frank about her apprehension that she is afraid of saying the wrong thing. Although she is four films old now this is her first Malayalam film, a sort of homecoming. Dressed in yellow, her hair let loose and a tiny bindi on her forehead, she is the proverbial girl next door. As Nikitha in Varanne... she has impressed audiences and her father’s peers alike. Director Priyadarshan is “acha” (father) and her biggest critic while mother, actor Lissy, “amma” is her biggest fan.

Edited excerpts from a free-wheeling chat.

You are here, finally, in Malayalam films.

This is the industry I most wanted to get into and also most afraid of getting into. Afraid that I would let my parents down, that I’d disappoint them. I just wanted them to be proud. And today I am happy because I know acha is very proud of me. After the release he has called me so many times. One of his director friends asked him ‘where have you been hiding her all this while?’ I am so happy that he is happy. To be honest I am more happy that he is happy.

Are you a daddy’s girl or a mama’s girl?

Most definitely a daddy’s girl...but I am close to both my parents. Amma is my biggest fan; achan is my biggest critic, so it is difficult to please my father. I am always trying to make him proud.

What is the best thing that you have heard about the film?

It was from Sathyan (Anthikkad) uncle. He thought I was good in the film. I told him it was because my co-actors gave me so much – I just had to react. And that Anoop ettan also helped me because I struggled initially not knowing the pitch of the character. Sathyan uncle said ‘unless you have it in you no director can bring it out’. Then he said something for which I am on cloud nine, that he felt like writing something he and I could work together on. That was the biggest compliment. Acha had wanted me to be launched in a Sathyan Anthikkad film, but it didn’t happen then.

Your father never evinced an interest in launching you?

He knows me very well and he knew I would be most scared working with him. He was completely right. For Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham, in which I do a cameo it was only a couple of day’s shoot. I struggled with the couple of lines I had. He couldn’t figure out how to direct me and I couldn’t figure out how to act with him next to me. My heart was beating so loudly that the whole set could hear it. It was mad and it was drama...he shouted at me because I forgot my lines and I never forget lines. But he had predicted this, at the time I didn’t understand. He had told me ‘for your first five films I don’t think we should work together because it will be too much on you.’ I realise that now.

Telugu, Tamil and now Malayalam... were you waiting for a good script?

Yes, it was mostly waiting. My favourite film is Nadodikaatu, and there is that line ‘ellathinum athinte samayamund dasa’ (there is a time for everything). I was patient and I am glad I waited. Nikky, my character, is the core of this film. I don’t think I would have got such a role if I was impatient. I was waiting for a project that gave me scope, because I wanted acha and amma to be proud. That wouldn’t come from other language films. This is the industry that gave me my parents, they worked 40 years to build their careers and I couldn’t destroy all that with one film.

Not a cakewalk for star kids People think we, star kids, get into this for the glitz and glamour. You have only seen that side of it. We have seen the other side, which would be motivation to stay away. The only reason we are here is our passion for films. Our father’s career graphs have seen as many lows as highs; we have seen the ups and downs. My argument is that we are here because we love films. Maybe that first chance is easy afterwards it is all you. There is pressure too.

Your father is an inspiration for so many filmmakers. Growing up, were you aware of your parents’ fame?

The best thing my parents did was to make me study in Chennai. I was in a school where most others around me were also from film industry families so none of us realised what our parents were. In fact the first time I truly understood my father’s impact was when we were shooting the film. Every second line spoken was a reference to one of acha’s films. He never went around making a big deal of himself or anything...so we were never exposed to what he is. Anoop ettan was saying, ‘you guys have no idea how big your father is, do you?’ I know him as my father and I love him no matter who he is.

You studied architecture, was cinema part of the plan?

It was always there, the end point of the journey. I didn’t know what I’d do in cinema. I am a shy person who is not very okay with the camera. I never thought I had it in me to be an actor. There is so much more to the job than acting. But my parents gave me confidence. Amma was the first person who told me I would be good at this. Then I told acha, he was very happy.

Factfile Before Kalyani became actor, she assisted art director Sabu Cyril.

She made her acting début in Telugu, in 2017, with Hello opposite Akhil Akineni and Tamil, in 2019, with Hero opposite Sivakarthikeyan.

Her other Malayalam films are Vineeth Sreenivasan’s Hridyam and Priyadarshan’s Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham.

Did your parents ever nudge you towards films?

It was the opposite. Anoop ettan, Dulquer and I bonded over the fact that none of our parents wanted us to get into films. Probably because they understood and knew the business. We have all done different things before we got into films.

Acting advice from your mother?

Her main advice is to be confident. Acha’s advice is more precise and to the point mainly because he is my biggest critic.

You have worked in three industries. Are the styles very different?

Absolutely. Malayalam is like family, maybe because my family is deeply rooted in the industry. I love both Telugu and Tamil industries, but I’ve never felt like I am part of family until this film. Possibly because everything is on a smaller scale, it feels like everybody is closer to each other.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/qaucqs/article30821467.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpkalyani5jpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/as-kalyani-priyadarshan-dbuts-in-malayalam-films-with-varane-aavashyamund-she-talks-about-her-excitement-of-it-and-of-overcoming-the-expectations-of-being-a-star-child/article30821471.ece
191,2020/02/14,"Remembering 'Chelleli Kapuram', the Telugu film that set the standard for 'sibling sentiment' themes","The 1971 film starred tarring Sobhan Babu, Nababhushanam, Vanisri and Manimala

Well-executed screen stories on brother-sister bonding were always a great hit with the audience right from the N T Ramarao era (Rakthasambandham,1962) to his namesake grandson’s times (Rakhi 2006). Almost every popular lead actor from A. Nageswara Rao (Bangaru Gajulu, 1968) to Chiranjeevi (Hitler, 1997), Mahesh Babu (Arjun, 2004), Pawan Kalyan (Annavaram, 2006) and Rajasekhar (Gorintaku, 2008) played the adoring elder brother and won the viewers hearts with their sensitive portrayals. In short, the sibling sentiment has become part of a success formula in contemporary Telugu celluloid themes. And the latest example was the Naga Sourya starrer, Aswathama.

When veteran actor Mannava Balaiah ventured into film production by launching Amritha Films, he chose to follow this sibling sentiment formula for his maiden production. Interestingly, Balaiah has written a short novel titled Nalupu – Thelupu on the theme, during his student days which was published in the fortnightly magazine ‘Tufan’ brought out by Lakshmi Narayana from Madras. Balaiah added a few characters and scenes to the novel and gave it to K.Viswanath to write the screenplay and direct the movie with the title, Chelleli Kapuram.

The story

Ramu’s (played by Sobhan Babu) life revolves around writing poetry and his sister Sita (Manimala). Ramu’s paternal uncle (Rao Gopala Rao) chides him for neglecting to perform Sita’s marriage. In order to raise money for her wedding, Ramu goes to the city to sell his poetry to publishers but meets with no success. He meets his childhood friend Sri Ram (Nagabhushanam). The worldly wise Sri Ram markets Ramu’s poetry to a publisher (Chaya Devi) who under the impression that they are his works, publishes them in Sri Ram’s name. Instead of getting upset, Ramu expresses happiness that his writings are finally in print and are lauded. Ramu performs the marriage of his sister with Sri Ram. During their stay in a hotel, Sri Ram suspects Sita of infidelity leading to her angst.

Meanwhile, a diehard fan of ‘Sri Ram’s poetry (actually written by Ramu), Radha (Vanisri), a college student from Vizag, regularly writes letters to him and even vows to marry him. While replying to her letters, Ramu too falls in love with her. Radha meets Sri Ram under the impression that he is the real author. However, she soon discovers that Ramu is the real poet. The truth is established. Sri Ram realises his folly and unites with Sita. Ramu marries Radha.

Cast and crew

K. Viswanath’s forte was the ability to extract a subtle display of emotions from his actors, even in highly charged scenes. Not a single frame in such sequences went overboard, speaking volumes for the sound engineer-turned emerging filmmaker’s proficiency. He was ably supported by the dialogue writer Gollapudi Maruthi Rao, cinematographer S.S. Lal and editor Veerappa.

It was the time when Sobhan Babu was experimenting with his on screen roles. After playing the old man in Tahsildar Gari Ammayi, he took up the deglamorised character of the dark-skinned Ramu in Chelleli Kapuram. He came up trumps with his subtle but effective portrayal as the passionate poet who remains incognito and as the doting brother.

Though a little bit of negative shades were added to his character towards the second half of the movie, by and large Nagabhushanam in a positive role as Sri Ram, scores. Manimala as Shoban Babu’s sister, Vanisri as his fan-turned-love interest played their characters well.

Nirmala acted as the hero’s aunt and Allu Ramalingaiah and Chaya Devi as the book publishers. Sathyanarayana played Raghavaiah, the moneylender who unwittingly was the cause for Sita’s plight. Chandramohan makes a cameo appearance in a stage drama as Lord Krishna. Sandhyarani and K.V. Chalam filled in the light banter.

K.V. Mahadevan’s music compositions made a large contribution for the film’s success. Though all the songs from the album were a hit, the chartbusters among them were ‘Charana kinkinulu ghallu ghallumana’ and ‘Kanula mundu neevunte kavitha pongi paaradaa’ written by C. Narayana Reddy and rendered by P. Susheela and S.P. Balasubrahmanyam.

Trivia

The first day’s shoot on Sobhan Babu was held at Arasu Studios located in the Madras Film Institute complex. Sobhan Babu’s personal makeup man Akula Apparao first tested the dark makeup on journalist turned actor Echuri Chalapathi Rao and only then did the makeup on Sobhan Babu.

Manimala debuted in a small role in the ANR starrer, Kulagothralu (1962) and the next year in Tamil with the MGR starrer, Periya Idathu Penn and played the heroine in Modern Theatres, Vallavanukku Vallavan. A popular actress in Tamil, Manimala played Suhasini’s mother in K. Balachander’s 1985 classic Sindhubhairavi. She had also acted in Malayalam and Kannada movies besides a few Telugu films. Manimala was an accomplished classical dancer and toured United Kingdom. Manimala married veteran Tamil comedy actor ‘Venniradai’ Murthy.

Soon after working for Chelleli Kapuram, the film’s production controller Kesana Jayaram turned producer and made Marapurani Thalli (1972) with which D.S. Prakasa Rao debuted as a director. D.S. started his career in films as an apprentice under Vittalacharya and then worked as an assistant director for such names as – P. Pullaiah, V. Madhusudana Rao and Bapu. Prior to entering films, D.S. Prakasa Rao ran a fancy shop in Ponnur in Guntur District.

Produced by B. Krishnaswamy and A. Suryanarayana with M. Balaiah as the presenter, Chelleli Kapuram hit the screens on November 27, 1971 and met with box office success.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/60okkv/article30821128.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf14Manimala-Sobhan-Babu-in-Chelleli-Kapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/remembering-chelleli-kapuram-the-telugu-film-that-set-the-standard-for-sibling-sentiment-themes/article30821132.ece
192,2020/02/14,‘Sara and Kartik didn’t meet; It was Zoe and Veer everyday',"Actors Sara Ali Khan and Kartik Aaryan on discovering their characters Zoe and Veer for 'Love Aaj Kal'

Actor Sara Ali Khan briskly entered the room, running on a late schedule, before polite greetings signalled the beginning of her poised chat. Her co-star Kartik Aaryan’s chat flowed differently. He excused himself to take a break between his interviews, asked for his second coffee to be replaced after it also turned cold, and wound down by teaching the dance steps in the actors’ Haan Main Galat music video to the others in the Window Seat Films office near Four Bungalows. The two are being paired for the first time in Imtiaz Ali’s upcoming Love Aaj Kal, though fans have been “shipping” the actors for long now.

Palpable chemistry

While the two have faced invasive scrutiny about the status of their relationship, Khan stressed that during the shoot, “Sara and Kartik didn’t meet. It was Zoe and Veer everyday on-set,” said the actor, explaining that while working on the film, the two were Imtiaz Ali’s characters, “an idealistic boy and a pragmatic girl – their chemistry was so exciting.”

The film is a spiritual successor to Ali’s 2009 film – starring Deepika Padukone and Sara’s father, Saif Ali Khan – and will also unpack the ways in which romance has changed over the decades. The two timelines of this 2020 iteration revolve around the present-day relationship between career-focussed Zoe and romantic Veer in 2020, and Leena’s (Arushi Sharma) blossoming small-town love with Raghu – again played by Kartik Aaryan – in 1990.

Contemporary interpretation

Khan saw a lot of herself in Zoe – whether being brought up by a single parent or their focus on their careers – but noted that Zoe was a lot more aggressive and reactive than her. “Zoe is not your archetypal heroine,” she stressed, “she runs to the male protagonist and says ‘fuck you’ [in a scene included in the trailer] – you don’t see that very often. It’s representative of what women are today – they are more outspoken, louder, more financially independent, [and] more career-driven. There’s [also] more equality in relationships – desires and expectations have all changed so much over the years.” For Aaryan, the challenge rested in creating unique characters out of Veer – honest, smart, and idealistic and in Aaryan’s words “he might come across as creepy” – and of Raghu – the confident and filmy lover. “I had to specifically work on the body language,” shared the actor, explaining that while Veer kept to himself, Raghu would behave like he owned the place. Aaryan would find his Veer in the notes scribbled onto the walls of the character’s Delhi house or in the pots and pans littered around the house from which Veer would directly have his meals.

And for Raghu, Aaryan shared, “I would keep Salman [Khan] sir’s songs playing on the sets to create that vibe.” He also kept watching a stream of ’80s and ’90s films from Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), Salman Khan’s first lead role, to the 1988 take on Romeo and Juliet – Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak.

Career confidence

In his nine-year-old career, Aaryan has often faced criticism for portraying similar, misogynistic characters that are variations of ordinary men who blame the women in their lives for their unhappiness. He admitted that he doesn’t pay too much attention to the opprobrium because he sees that his films, whether the two Pyaar Ka Punchnamas (2011 and 2015), Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety (2018) or Pati Patni Aur Woh (2019) are successful at the box office. “Consecutive films are working and being loved. There’s a reason that filmmakers are collaborating with me, so I must be doing something right,” he said simply, adding that he’s enjoying the more recent stream of offers after the few tough years that followed his successful debut.

Khan, on the other hand, is only two films old. But with a noteworthy debut in Kedarnath (2018) and as the face of brands like Puma India and Garnier India, she is often called a youth icon and has lent her voice to events like the Under 25 Summit and Barkha Dutt’s We the Women summit. Her comments on colourism – “If you want to be tan, just put on some bronzer. If you want to be fair, put on some powder” – received backlash at Dutt’s event. During our chat, she said “Maybe I sounded a little rash when I said that. I’m an independent and confident girl, so it’s easier for me to say things sometimes than it [probably] would be for the average Indian woman to take it. But I still don’t believe in victimising yourself.” Khan reiterated that people should have confidence in themselves, but when asked about the systemic discrimination people face on the basis of their skin tone, she repeated, “You can urge people to change, but I think that is a longer shot than just growing thicker skin and just saying forget it.”

Outside films

While Aaryan never considered a life outside of being an actor, Khan, a Columbia University graduate in history and political science, still believes being a lawyer or joining politics is on the cards for her. When asked about how they are dealing with the news of the anti-CAA and NRC protests around the country, Aaryan offered a vague statement about getting involved when needed, and Khan softly said she did not want to talk about it before waiting for the next question.

But the two actors got chattier when discussing what’s next on their plate. Aaryan will be part of Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, Dostana 2 and Om Raut’s next – an action film. Khan will be seen opposite Varun Dhawan in the Coolie No. 1 remake and Aanand L. Rai’s Atrangi Re.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/q89hub/article30821015.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bm-pg5-Love-Aaj-Kal-film-still-4,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sara-and-kartik-didnt-meet/article30821017.ece

194,2020/02/14,Keeping it colloquial: Manu Rishi Chadha on his role in 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan',"Ahead of the release of the gay romance, the actor-writer speaks about Rajat Kapoor being his 'cinema school', the growing popularity of character actors and more

“It is because of the interview’s pressure that I am being serious, otherwise, I am a boisterous man.” While talking to actor-writer Manu Rishi Chadha, one can see shades of different characters that he has played over the years: the sinister friend Bengali in “Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!”, the gossipmonger in “Aankhon Dekhi” or the quirky wannabe gangster from “Phas Gaye Re Obama”. Recently, he impressed as a Haryanvi tycoon who owns a T20 team in Amazon Prime’s “Inside Edge”.

While talking, Manu constantly makes gestures to explain his point. He even performs dialogues from classic Hindi films in his colloquial style which impresses the people around. He showcases the same warmth and sense of humour that sets him apart in all his roles as an actor.

“I am from a Punjabi family and we are loud people. Whatever you see on screen is what I have observed around me while growing up in north India,” he chuckles. His Delhi-Punjabi dialect has worked well in films as his skill-set of adapting to different local accents goes well with his ever-changing physical appearances.

His upcoming film “Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan” depicts such quirky yet real characters amidst a gay love story set in the Hindi heartland. Manu says, ""I am playing the character of Jeetu's chacha. I was in the mind of Hitesh Kevaliya, the director, but he politely asked for an audition. I immediately agreed. Seldom do you get to work with such a stellar ensemble of brilliant performers and a gripping story which is set in a traditional setting and yet talks of contemporary issues,"" he says.

He spent a lot of time with his father and uncles and connected their impressions with his own experiences. “I did not use any method in the film. I simply remained younger brother of Gajraj (Rao) ji throughout the shoot. The characters were written in detail. The director especially asked us to keep away from underlining anything. I did not follow any particular mannerism to highlight the character.”

Son of a businessman father and an art connoisseur mother, Manu was born and raised in Delhi. Most of his teenage years went into reading “Dharmyug”, a popular Hindi magazine, and delving into Hindi literature. His parents supported his theatre career as his mother is a great admirer of theatre. From a very young age, he took part in discussions on serious parallel cinema and Delhi theatre circuit of which his mother was a regular visitor.

“ ‘Julius Caesar’ was my first play. Theatre shaped my viewpoint about the world, socio-politically. I did professional theatre for eight years before coming to Mumbai at the age of 29,” recalls Manu, who was introduced by noted theatre director Arvind Gaur

For Manu, who was trained in theatre, shift to films was not sudden. He spent time with actor-director Rajat Kapoor.

‘Cinema school’

“Rajat is my cinema school. I have learnt like Eklavya from him. He does not believe in educating but asks to be around. I met him during his play where I used to do sound, lighting and sometimes acting. He told me that cinema is all about internal conviction and if you are internally convinced, the reactions on the body will be accurate,” he reminisces.

Theatre actors are often blamed for having loud emotions and animated faces which sometimes becomes difficult for the medium of cinema. Manu agrees. “Use of body in cinema is different from the projection required in theatre acting. For the cinema, you must understand the frame and the lenses. While speaking, you do not have to be loud but understand how far the other character is from you. One thing that separates a good actor from the rest of the crowd is how you maintain the rhythm and pace of acting. You must wire your mind according to the mind space of the character. It helps you to give similar reactions in different timelines. You must maintain the same rhythm in rehearsal, actual shoot, and dubbing.""

Reflecting on his first film, Manu reminds that he wrote the dialogues of “Oye Lucky!, Lucky Oye!” as well. “Whenever I used to write dialogues keeping old films or cinema as a reference, Dibakar (Banerjee) would correct me and ask me to go colloquial,” informs Manu.

Collective efforts

He goes on explaining how in those years collective efforts of people from similar experiences resulted in a shift in cinema. “It was because a similar school of thought came together. A perfect synchronisation happened because while we were observing life as actors, someone was observing life for writing a story or a novel. They have the same process. The coming together thus resulted in extraordinary results which pushed Hindi cinema to a new level,” he explains.

On the growing popularity of character actors, Manu says, “Twenty years ago, people could not relate to the hero of the film because he was larger than life. Today's hero is a normal guy going through a situation. It compels actors around him to be equally believable.”

A writer himself, he wants to tell his own stories which have defined his approach towards life and informed him as an artist. He has written scripts for films, including the recent “Naanu ki Jaanu”, and dialogues for several films. But he considers his professional writing is different from his personal writing which has not appeared yet. “I remember many such incidents which can work as research material for my fictionalised world. They have inspired me and shaped my socio-political perspective of the world. One day, I will share those feelings with the world,” he sums up.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/60nf11/article30820661.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20191118-WA0016,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/keeping-it-colloquial-manu-rishi-chadha-on-his-role-in-shubh-mangal-zyada-saavdhan/article30820662.ece
195,2020/02/14,"Janina Gavankar on ‘The Morning Show’, her new arthouse-horror short ‘Stucco’, and outrage culture","The filmmaker, gamer and actor — who will be starring alongside Ben Affleck in ‘The Way Back’ — was also the first actor to get on Twitter

Sometime last November, Janina Gavankar met a designer who introduced her to hot yoga. “I remember thinking ‘why is this non-Indian man introducing me to something my people created?’” laughs the actor over the phone. Having starred in Apple TV’s The Morning Show (TMS), and the upcoming Ben Affleck-starrer, The Way Back, Gavankar has her plate full but makes time for a quick interview. “I watched Bikram on Netflix the first week I started going to hot yoga,” she continues. “I was upset, yet not surprised. There are different versions [of hot yoga] that haven’t come from him and the main thing is that this has been helping me [with work-life balance].” Nevertheless, that is how hot yoga became an outlet for the actor, gamer, brand owner and filmmaker.

The grey area

Incidentally, TMS and The Way Back were shot at the same time. “On TMS, I would be with giant hair to improvise comedy quips, and then the next day I would be sobbing in a car with Ben. The Way Back has a lot of heavy themes,” she agrees, “but I want to examine the parts of ourselves that we are not proud of, which the film absolutely does. You have to find the courage to peel off all your skin and go for it. Director Gavin O’Connor created a very safe environment for me to do that, and Ben is so raw from this piece and we’re very proud of what we did.”

The royal picture Gavankar made it to a certain former-Sussex royal couple’s high-profile wedding guest list and also shot the couple’s Christmas card last year. But whatever you do, do not ask her for her comments; she remains a loyal friend. She observes that her career is more interesting than how much the press has exploited her to make relevant headlines. “I went to the Grammys as plus-one with one of my best friends, Questlove, who performs with The Roots; I did three interviews on camera and at least two of them made a headline using her name even though I said nothing about her. I understand that press outlets need to use clickbait to keep people on their pages. While this is systemic, that does not mean that I have to be happy about it. Read beyond the headlines. We can’t blame Twitter and social media for the ‘uninformed’ dilemma among people.”

Social observer of the “blind tribalism that’s been around since the dawn of humanity”, Gavankar, 39, has a lot to say about the outrage culture by which we are enveloped. And that is why she loves TMS. “With outrage culture, everything is black and white, but the show itself really examines the grey area — specifically in complicity. We have Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) who thinks she has done nothing wrong, and (spoiler alert) over the course of a season she sees that she is actually part of the problem,” she says.

Meanwhile, her own character, Alison, gets interviewed and she doesn’t see anything wrong either, “but, at the end of the last episode, she has tears in her eyes, because she knows she’s been a part of the problem and her way through it is to say ‘I’m fine with it’. The series examines that even good people can be part of a big systemic problem.”

And then there is Stucco, Gavankar’s own project with Russo Schelling, her creative partner of five years. The short film, gaining traction at the US festival circuits, including the upcoming SXSW in Texas, follows an agoraphobic woman who addresses the changes around her. Funnily enough this was filmed in an area of Chicago in which the actor grew up.

So why arthouse horror for some place special? “It is an incredible genre in that you can use it in analogy, to pinpoint a specific feeling or concept that is hard to encapsulate, or something that hasn’t really been addressed in other pieces. The best thing in horror is that you can monsterise something; we are used to humanising things but here you can use that to monsterise dread or anxiety or grief. We wanted to tell this specific story in a short film; it’s highly personal to both of us in different ways and we had to get it out of our bodies. You don’t have to make a 90-minute version when we’ve already told the story.”

She and Russo were not sure how the world would receive it but they are glad thank the stars that people have loved it. “We won a Zeiss screenwriting competition for which they gave us sponsorship and for the rest of the project, I took a paycheck from The Morning Show and I paid for some of it. I know that I am in a very rare situation to be a well-fed artiste. In the long time I’ve been the game, nobody has handed me the opportunity to make my own films. I’ve produced and paid for all my music videos because ‘if you wait around, nobody’s going to hand you an opportunity.’”

Deep dive

Not many know that Gavankar is the first actor to use Twitter. She chuckles as she recalls the day she signed up in 2006. Her initial stream of consciousness tweets included shuttling around California. Did she know Twitter would become a cataclysmic social platform? “I knew it would enable double listening, and that we didn’t have to be filtered. With the shortening of the message along with the forced brevity, the social network enacted real change, for good and for bad,” says the actor, who will next be seen in Season 2 of the sci-fi series Mandalorian.

The force certainly is with Gavankar, given she has worked on the action shooter video game Star Wars: Battlefront II as a voice and motion capture artiste. She finds the space for motion capture (MC), in particular, to be inspiring. “I enjoy interactive storytelling with a passion. MC is physically freeing; you’re allowed to use more of your physical instruments and you can go really wild with your imagination. You’re in essentially a black-box theatre atmosphere where there are no props and everything is theatre of the minds and the artistes and actors in this space are so gifted. It is a meritocracy much more in MC than on-camera, because they can turn you into a dinosaur. You can be the prettiest kid in Kansas City and end up on some giant TV show for a few episodes.” Would she ever like to create a film using MC? “Absolutely 100%.”

Gavankar concludes by saying she owes her work ethic, ambition and value for education to her Mumbai roots. “My father, like most Indian-Americans, came here on a college scholarship. He and my mother taught my sister and me about work ethics.I’m proud to be Indian; it is the reason why I think I’m morally and spiritually okay, even this many years into this very strange business.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jma91m/article30820325.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08WK-Janina-Gavankar-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/interview-janina-gavankar-on-the-morning-show-stucco-the-way-back-motion-capture-tech-mumbai-roots/article30820331.ece
196,2020/02/14,Tracking the emergence of a credible father figure in Hindi cinema,"He may be late to the party, but a more rounded and credible father figure is finally emerging in Hindi cinema

The caring, affectionate father is such a rarity on screen that when you do spot one, you do a double-take. Did I see it right or is there a catch, I wondered while watching Panga. The bar is set so low for a father that actor Jassi Gill’s ever smiling, gentle, empathetic Prashant anchors the film just as much as Kangana Ranaut’s meticulously played Jaya.

After several years of prioritising their son Adi’s well-being, Jaya decides to go back to kabaddi while her husband Prashant takes over as the primary parent. This is easier said than done because although Prashant has a deep, playful bond and an easy camaraderie with their son, his housekeeping and cooking skills are questionable. But he steps up nevertheless, with some help from his mother-in-law. About the writing of Prashant’s character, director Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari has said in interviews that she thought it was time to show progressive men who acknowledge this “era of coexistence”.

While motherhood has been closely and frequently deconstructed in Hindi films, there haven’t been nearly as many nuanced explorations of fatherhood, or even glimpses of its complexity, outside the realm of the breadwinner or keeper of family honour. And so we have routinely seen fathers who are villain-like: conservative, authoritarian, violent and woefully one-note. The overarching patriarch has, in film after film, represented the conflict between the new and old in Indian society, standing as a larger-than-life obstacle between tradition and modernity.

Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge

Upright, upper-class

It has been 25 years since Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ), and it’s still hard to shake off the series of resounding slaps that Baldev Singh (Amrish Puri) delivers to Raj (Shah Rukh Khan) for daring to fall in love with his daughter Simran (Kajol). Warring, murderous fathers in Hindi movies of the 80s and 90s were as common as sacrificing, weepy mothers; the father’s primary role was to stand in the way of their offspring’s happiness — albeit often with a miraculous change of heart by the end of the film. Then there is the slightly better template of the morally upright, good-at-heart father. In the book Hero, Ashok Raj notes Amitabh Bachchan’s long run as “an upright, upper-class, omnipotent patriarch, who exercises his complete authority most of the time.”

When on-screen fathers are compelled by circumstances to become the primary caregiver, a few memorable characters emerge. An earnest Ramlal (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) in Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar works hard to keep the kitchen fires burning. Musician Rohit (Aamir Khan) quickly hones his parenting skills in Akele Hum Akele Tum (based on Kramer vs. Kramer) when his wife and fellow singer Kiran (Manisha Koirala) leaves him. The guilt of leaving her son behind eats away at Kiran, however, in a way it might not affect most fathers. In a letter to her young son, Kiran explains: “Sometimes fathers go to work and mothers take care of the home, but sometimes mothers go to work and fathers take care of the home”. By the end of the film, Rohit has fully embraced fatherhood.

Not the greatest

By the mid-90s, we got ‘daddy cool’ — the fun-loving, occasionally irresponsible breed — often written in as comic relief. Anupam Kher’s memorable role as a sympathetic, supportive father in DDLJ was the perfect foil to Puri’s bombastic Baldev. Saif Ali Khan in his most recent film Jawaani Jaaneman mines the party-boy forced to re-examine his ways as he wakes up — rather late — to his responsibility as not just a ‘papa’ but also a to-be grandpa. In Paa, Abhishek Bachchan’s sensitive Amol is also late to the party, but eventually gives off a warm paternal vibe.

Still from The Family Man

In the web series The Family Man, Manoj Bajpayee’s Srikant Tiwari plays a colourful father. “He is not the greatest husband or father... He can’t give much time to his family and even teaches his kids to lie,” as his creators Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K. said in an interview, but he is, nevertheless, a father who is both invested in, and exasperated, by his pair of children who often turn out to be a step ahead of him.

One of the quieter, more moving fatherly roles was Naseeruddin Shah’s Lalit Verma in Monsoon Wedding. It’s not often that we see this pure male parental pain and protective love that’s not wrapped up in layers of machismo. He is no hero; he struggles to make sense of his son’s love for cooking and dancing over cricket. But his love is immense. “These are my children, praji, I will protect them from even myself, if I have to...” he tells his older brother-in-law.

But it is eventually a character like Prashant that demands more from a father figure than we usually get: not a perfect parent by any account, but one who thinks beyond tired ideas of manhood. And so we get a man who feels authentic, with a real personality.

In the trailer of the upcoming social comedy about gay love, Shubh Mangal Zyada Savdhaan, when the mother (Neena Gupta) tells her husband (Gajraj Rao), “Haan, banoongi mein Mother India, ma ke paas dil hota hai,” (‘Yes I will be Mother India, mothers have hearts’) he shoots back sarcastically, “Haan, baap toh battery se chaltein hain!” (‘Yeah, and fathers run on batteries’) And that’s the difference. Bollywood baaps are beginning to grow a heart.

197,2020/02/14,A song to remember,"In the season of love, here are some rare romantic numbers that retain their magic

In the season when Cupid serves love with the breeze, it is pertinent to ask whether love inspires poetry or poetry ignites love? Whatever the answer, one is convinced a day without a song, a smile or a hug is a complete waste of time. Obviously, if music is the food of love, then Valentine’s Day is just the perfect occasion to play some soul stirring, rarely heard love songs of Hindi films that bless us with pristine joy of togetherness.

Most people can cite famous love songs such as “Chaudhavin Ka Chand Ho” (“Chaudhavin Ka Chand”), “Abhi Na Jaao Chhod Kar” (“Hum Dono”), “Tera Mera Pyaar Amar” (“Asli Naqli”), “Chand Aahein Bharega” (“Pooja Ke Phool”), “Tere Mere Sapne Ab Ek Rang Hain” (“Guide”), “Agar Mujhse Mohabbat Hai” (“Aap Ki Parchaayeen”) in a jiffy as these and many equally popular numbers have been on the list of listeners for decades. But nostalgia makesone unravel other delightfully ‘fragrant’ songs that have faded but not certainly forgotten and though the list could run in to hundreds, for lack of space, one will confine to a few that constantly tickle the aural taste buds!

The first to resonate is the dulcet “Aaj Ki Raat Nahin Shikwe Shikaayat Ke Liye” (“Dharamputra”) rendered by Mahendra Kapoor when his voice wasn’t reserved for by loud decibels of nationalism. Outlining sublime allure of conjugal bliss in a delicate tone, Kapoor is a revelation in N Datta’s soothing notes heightening Sahir Ludhianvi’s classic use of motifs and phrases to unravel subtle emotions. Surprisingly, Mahendra Kapoor is equally good in “Bhool Sakta Hai Bhala Kaun Tumhari Aankhein” from the same film and one wonders why he gave up the softer notes after the release of “Gumrah” in which too his voice gave wings to Ravi-Sahir’s hauntingly evocative “Ye Hawa Ye Fiza”.

Two compositions from “Bachpan” by Sardar Malik are arguably equal to the entire repertoire of his son Anu Malik. Lend ears to Rafi’s feather soft “Mujhe Tumse Mohabbat Hai Magar Main Kah Nahin Sakta” and you’ll float in an ocean of love… thereafter, play the silken soft duet “Tere Hum O Sanam” of Rafi – Suman Kalyanpur to understand how tenderness is bedrock of eternal love. One must add a word of caution that these songs are for listening and not for watching as they have been awfully filmed.

Mesmerising compositions

Duets are synonyms for togetherness and two creations, separated by a decade, are the mesmeric Rafi Sahab – Lata Mangeshkar numbers “Sun Mere Saajna” (“Ansoo”) and “Tum To Pyaar Ho Sajnaa” (“Sehra”). Lyrics of Qamar Jalalabadi and Hasrat Jaipuri evoke the finest virtues of an affectionate bond and are in perfect harmony with the musical notes of Husnlal Bhagatram and Ramlal; prodigies that inexplicably never attained commercial statures despite their respective genius. Two other alluring numbers by Rafi-Lata that take your breath away are “Saaz-e-Dil Chhed De” (“Passport”) and “Meri Duniya Mein Tum Aayee” (“Heer Raanjha”).

If the first penned by Qamar Jalalabadi under Kalyanji-Anandji’s baton is soothing water, the other composed by Madan Mohan is “smouldering ice” of fiery passion. The beauty of the second song by Kaifi Azmi is that it is the most sacred poem of sensuality you could ever hear anywhere…. provoking a calm but haloed tempest.

If Lata could enchant in Rafi Sahab’s company, Asha too could certainly sparkle with equal ease and though long overlooked by music directors, her prowess was never less than her sister. “Ye Haseen Raat Ye Bahaar Ka Samaa” (“Girls Hostel”) is so delectably uplifting that one is caressed to bewilderment… each word of S H Behari appeals to lovers since Rafi-Asha transport you into a dream world wherein Ravi synchronises each instrument and beat with the lovers’ longing. “Bombai Ka Babu” may have been a box office failure but Rafi-Asha’s “Deewana Mastana Hua Dil” is still a magical wand to win a lover’s heart. Dada Burman, in step with Majrooh Sultanpuri’s poetic imagery, allows the two singers to go back and forth in vocal modulations just like the way Suchitra Sen swings to Dev Anand’s entreaties. So blissfully enamouring are these two songs that they could evoke amorous feelings in anyone listening to them on a moonlit night!

There are many songs that could make anyone swoon in delight but none more so than “Koyi Mujhse Pooche Ke Tum Mere Kya Ho” (“Ye Raaste Hain Pyar Ke”). Mind you there is also a flip and fiery side to this number but the tender, romantic version is perhaps one of the finest pieces of love poetry ever rendered on Indian screen. Each word from Rajendra Krishan’s pen is a poignant thought of supreme devotion and dedication to a beloved, worth miles to go and listen especially since Ravi serves poetry in soft, delectable arrays of musical patterns. And if Sunil Dutt brings credibility with his portrayal, it is all thanks to the genius of Rafi Sahab echoing the pine and the pangs with immaculate perfection. This ability to emote the honest feelings of longing lovers is something Rafi could do with unfailing regularity and two memorable numbers come to mind that could perhaps even entrap the Cupid with their honeyed rendition. “Tum Ek Baar Mohabbat Ka Imtihaan To Lo’ (“Babar”) and “Ek But Banaunga Tera Aur Pooja Karunga” (“Asli Naqli”) are simplest of songs but Rafi’s exposition haunts you long with the emotions served by Sahir and Hasrat via Roshan and Shankar-Jaikishan’s musical offering. Listen with your eyes closed and probably you would attain peace of nirvana!

Indeed, there are several such melodies that are equally arresting and pleasing. But just as not every diamond adorns the crown, many invaluable song gotlost in the dark alleys of time. A musical pearl is there for picking everywhere provided we look for it. Since life goes better with music, let us pick these rare gems to enrich ourselves sublime romance.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mzxdfr/article30820101.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14DFR1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/a-song-to-remember/article30820104.ece
198,2020/02/14,All eyes on the upcoming Berlin International Film Festival,"The festival’s landmark year sees two new directors, dark tones and themes like migration. But there are no Indian films in competition

As Berlin experiences its coldest time of the year, people look forward to the Berlinale for two reasons: it means spring is near and they can watch non-dubbed world cinema. The Berlin International Film Festival or Berlinale, is first of the three big European festivals (Cannes and Venice being the other two) that sets the agenda for the year’s festival circuit. It is possibly the only time when Berlin’s artists and hipsters huddle to its commercial centre, Potsdamer Platz, normally reserved for capitalists, suits and tourists.

Feeling adventurous

Now in its landmark 70th year, the Berlinale (February 20 to March 1) has, over the decades, built a reputation for taking risks and pushing the boundaries in both narrative and form. In 2018, Touch Me Not, the Romanian film on the fear of intimacy, won the Golden Bear, garnering a lot of rebukes. But the 2019 winner, Synonyms, a semi-autobiographical French-Israeli refugee rager, became a festival darling. At first glance, it seems the 2020 line-up could go either way but the appetite for risk-taking is evident.

Among the 18 films competing for the Golden Bear this year, is an offspring of Russian filmmaker Ilya Khrzhanovsky’s bizarre Soviet experiment, DAU, which began in 2005. What started off as a biopic of Russian theoretical physicist Lev Landau, who won the Nobel Prize in 1962, became a social experiment. The filmmaker built a gargantuan set, modelled after a secret Soviet research institute, to recreate three decades of Soviet history. A cast of over 400 non-actors lived on set for over two years, wearing costumes even off-camera. With over 700 hours of footage and a lot of controversies akin to the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment, the much-anticipated experimental project was eventually showcased last year. The series of films and visual installations played non-stop for over three weeks in Paris. At the festival, one feature film from this project, DAU. Natasha, is in competition while the another DAU. Degeneratsia (DAU. Degeneration) is in Berlinale Special.

Changes at the helm

The festival this year has had an overhaul. After heading the Berlinale for 18 years, festival director Dieter Kosslick, has passed the baton to artistic director Carlo Chatrian, who previously helmed Locarno, and executive director, Mariette Rissenbeek. But the 2020 competition lineup does not indicate a radical departure from the festival’s curatorial mix of European art-house, indie titles and a nose for politically-responsive and potentially-controversial films. For Berliners, Burhan Qurbani’s Berlin Alexanderplatz, hits home by following the story of an African refugee from Guinea-Bissau who comes to the German capital on a boat without identity papers. Todos os mortos (All the Dead Ones), the Brazilian-French drama by Caetano Gotardo and Marco Dutra, casts an eye on post-slavery in Brazil. In Abel Ferrara’s, Siberia, actor Willem Dafoe traverses across a frozen landscape in search of meaning. “If there is a predominance of dark tones, this may be because the films we have selected tend to look at the present without illusion — not to cause fear, but because they want to open our eyes,” says Chatrian.

Berlinale’s beloved German auteur, Christian Petzold returns to the festival two years after the critically-loved Transit, to compete with his latest, Undine. While Undine is set in dream-like modern-day Berlin, Transit stripped a World War II story off its period setting, in tandem with his penchant for ghostly figures. “When you have the past and contemporary moment in the same place, you start thinking about what is happening to Europe and why racists are everywhere,” he had said after the première of Transit at the 2018 Berlinale. His earlier works Barbara, Yella and Ghosts had also competed for the Golden Bear.

No Indian entry

It is interesting to note that amidst smaller changes brought in by the new leadership, there is a conspicuous absence of Netflix films in competition. The American streaming giant has often found itself at loggerheads with top-league European film festivals like Cannes and Berlinale. But among the big American studios, Pixar’s Onward, will have its world première at the festival.

Although, there’s no Indian film in competition, Prateek Vats’ Eeb Allay Ooo!, Pushpendra Singh’s Laila Aur Saat Geet and Akshay Indikar’s Sthalpuran — Chronicle of Space are part of sections like Panorama and Encounters. Hong Sangsoo’s Domangchin yeoja (The Woman Who Ran) from the Republic of Korea and Tsai Ming-Liang’s Rizi (Days) from Taiwan are representing Asian cinema in competition.

Gender bender

To be more gender-inclusive, the festival had pledged 5050×2020 last year, a gender-parity movement which aims to foster better gender ratio at film festivals. Among the competing films, six are directed or co-directed by women, a step down from seven last year. Interestingly, two of these six films, Eliza Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always and Kelly Reichardt’s First Cow, are not world premières, an unusual scenario for Berlinale. Beyond competition films, sexuality and gender have been an integral part of the festival’s Panorama section, often highlighting the various intersections of identity politics. This year, migration, the idea of home, exploitation of our planet and queer identities are the dominant themes. “The programme is emblematic of the urgency for political action and civil disobedience,” observes Panorama head, Michael Stütz. Kitty Green’s The Assistant, for instance, delves into the #MeToo movement in the entertainment industry and David France’s bold documentary, Welcome to Chechnya chronicles the systemic persecution of queer people by the Chechen authorities, in homophobic present-day Russia.

The 70th edition will open with Philippe Falardeau’s My Salinger Year, which stars Margaret Qualley as an aspiring poet Joanna, who works as an assistant to a literary agent. “Philippe Falardeau depicts the small NYC literary world of the 1990s with humour and a sweet note, but he never forgets the 21st century we are living in or the unifying role that art plays in all of our lives,” shares Chatrian. The international jury will be headed by acclaimed British actor Jeremy Irons and actor Helen Mirren will be awarded an honorary Golden Bear for her lifetime achievement. Politician Hillary Clinton and actors Cate Blanchett, Johnny Depp, Elle Fanning, Javier Bardem and Salma Hayek are expected to walk the red carpet, lending star power to a festival that is striving to find a renewed relevance this year.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/b9l7yw/article30819297.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kelly-Reichardts-First-Cow,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/a-look-at-the-upcoming-berlin-international-film-festival/article30819301.ece
199,2020/02/14,"Billie Eilish releases ‘No Time to Die’ title song, becomes youngest singer to record ‘James Bond’ theme","The 25th installment in the franchise will mark the last outing for Daniel Craig as the 007 agent

Teen pop sensation Billie Eilish has come out with the official theme song of Daniel Craig’s upcoming James Bond movie No Time To Die.

The 18-year-old singer, who has written the song with her brother Finneas O’Connell, is the youngest artiste in history to record the theme track for the long-running spy franchise.

The slow, moody track song produced by Eilish, Finneas and Stephen Lipson, and has orchestral arrangements by Hans Zimmer and Matt Dunkley and guitar from Johnny Marr.

“It feels crazy to be a part of this in every way. To be able to score the theme song to a film that is part of such a legendary series is a huge honour. James Bond is the coolest film franchise ever to exist. I’m still in shock,” the singer said in a statement posted on official site of the franchise.

With her track, Eilish follows in the footsteps of British singers Adele and Sam Smith, who won an Oscar each for their songs in Skyfall (2012) and Spectre (2015), respectively.

The singer, who recently won five Grammy awards, will be performing the song for the first time at the Brit Awards in London on February 18.

No Time To Die will mark the last outing for Craig as the suave 007 agent.

The Cary Fukunaga-directed film also features Ralph Fiennes as M, Naomie Harris as Moneypenny, Ben Whishaw as Q, Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner, Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter, Lea Seydoux as Madeleine Swann, and Christoph Waltz as Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

New cast members are Rami Malek, Ana de Armas, and Lashana Lynch.

200,2020/02/14,"‘Paapam Cheyyathavar Kalleriyatte’ is a social satire, says director Shambu Purushothaman","The film, Shambu Purushothaman’s second directorial venture after the sex comedy 'Vedivazhipadu', depicts certain incidents and goof-ups revolving around a betrothal

Over the years, Mollywood has produced some hard-hitting satires, so much so that gems such as Sandesham, Vellanakalude Nadu, Panchavadi Palam, Pranchiyettan & the Saint and more in that genre continue to tickle the funny bone. Filmmaker Shambu Purushothaman says his second directorial venture, Paapam Cheyyathavar Kalleriyatte, slated to hit the marquee later this month, is a social satire that depicts certain incidents and goof-ups revolving around a betrothal, which brings together friends and relatives.

“Paapam Cheyyathavar Kalleriyatte is set in a Christian context. We see characters of differing traits, manners and temperaments coming together for the betrothal and how this diversity affects the general harmony. Inevitably, problems crop up and things spin out of hand,” says Shambu over phone.

Just like his previous outing, the 2013 sex comedy Vedivazhipadu that raised some eyebrows for its bawdy humour through a story of three friends and their secret plans on the day of the famous Attukal Pongala, Paapam Cheyyathavar Kalleriyatte too carries a narrative with a short time-frame, effectively serving as a fitting vehicle to dissect human behaviour, says Shambu.

“The film is essentially a social commentary, with a generous serving of humour. However, certainly not slapstick but the kind of humour the viewer has to derive himself. My attempt is to represent serious topics in the garb of comedy, which makes them more digestible,” adds the Thiruvananthapuram-native, preferring not to divulge more about the plot. The movie is scripted by Shambu himself.

The filmmaker says PCK weaves in several subplots that altogether packs in a range of characters as he trains his observation on some “hypocrisies” seen in the society. “It’s not a story of just one person, but of a community, and hence by extension, a caricature of the society. Those who flit in and out of the screen serve as a sample cross-section,” says Shambu, a graduate of Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute in Kolkata.

The cast includes Vinay Forrt, Srinda, Tini Tom, Alencier, Madhupal, Santhy Balachadran, Saiju Kurup, Sunil Sukhada, Arun Kurian, Anumol K Manoharan, and Ambika Mohan among others. Shambu says the movie predominantly features indoor locations, which were shot in Kochi, while the outdoor portions were filmed near Mala in Thrissur. It has one song, ‘Minnal villal’, written by Anu Elizabeth Jose and set to tune by Prasanth Pillai. Cinematography is by Jomon Thomas, his junior in film school.

Speaking about the rather catchy title, Shambu says the biblical phrase has significance in what he endeavours to convey through the movie. “We have a tendency to easily judge others. When people claim they have opinion on anything and everything, often they mean their judgements. The assumption is we, perhaps, know everything about what we pass our judgements on. The fact that it (the phrase) comes from the Bible attests to how long such traits have been in us and it has not changed,” says the 40-year-old, adding that PCK zooms in on the importance of tolerance, acceptance of others and their point of view.

Shambu avers that, for him, a story is “a tool, a medium” to slice and dice the society and express his “insights and observations” gained from a detached reflection.

“But I like to lighten discussion of such serious topics and taboos with humour. The focus will still be on the commentary,” says the filmmaker, who finds K G George’s Panchavadi Palam as the epitome of satire in Malayalam cinema, while citing some of Sreenivasan’s yesteryear classics as well as inspiration.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/2xwc7d/article30819052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvmPCKstill1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/director-shambu-purushothaman-says-his-paapam-cheyyathavar-kalleriyatte-is-a-social-satire/article30819058.ece
201,2020/02/14,Mollywood actor-director Dileesh Pothan on why his role in ‘Trance’ is a new experience,"In ‘Trance’, Dileesh will be in the company of Fahadh Faasil with whom he has had reels of adventure in 'Maheshinte Prathikaram' and 'Thondimuthalam Driksakshiyum', that went on to win critical acclaim and box-office success as well

Dileesh Pothan insists that his work must speak for him. And that has been an eloquent testimony to his ability as an actor and director. Soon, it will be the turn of Dileesh, the actor, to be seen in Anwar Rashid’s Trance. Dileesh, as Avaraachan, will be in the company of Fahadh Faasil with whom he has had reels of adventure in Maheshinte Prathikaram and Thondimuthalam Driksakshiyum, both of which were helmed by Dileesh and went on to win critical acclaim and overwhelming box-office success as well.

“I have great expectations about Trance. It has been in the making for two years and we shot in Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu, places in Kerala and in Mumbai. Till Avaraachan came along, I had enacted characters that were done with in one schedule. Then I moved to the next one. In the case of such schedules, it was easier to stay in character. It is for the first time that I had spent such a long time on one character,” says Dileesh, speaking on phone from Ernakulam.

He admits that maintaining the character graph when there were long intervals between the shooting proved to be a challenge that he actually enjoyed as it was a new experience. So Dileesh took preparations to get into the skin of the character after a break, and he would watch the previous scenes to get a feel of the story. “It was also helpful because I could see my character and make corrections if necessary. It is my first film with Anwar, with whom I have always wanted to work,” he adds.

Dileesh Pothan | Photo Credit: special arrangment

In the coming months, Dileesh will be seen in some much-anticipated films such as Malik, Pada, Kallan and Thangam. Dubbing has been completed for Mahesh Narayanan’s Malik and Kamal’s Pada. The dubbing of Kallan remains. The shoot of Thangam, scripted by Syam Pushkaran, begins later this year.

Malik, says Dileesh, was another novel experience for him as he was enacting different ages of the same character as the story covered two decades. “That was my takeaway from Malik as my role ages on screen from 35 to 65,” he says.

Admitting that he is an actor who was co-opted to play certain roles at the last minute, Dileesh says it was his passion for cinema that brought him to tinsel town, and so long as he was learning and working in cinema, it did not matter whether he was assistant director, actor or associate director. “Sometimes, during a shoot, an actor might fail to turn up or there might be a need for an actor for a scene.... and then if the director asks me, I step in front of the camera,” he says modestly.

He got noticed in those brief roles in films beginning with Aashiq Abu’s Salt N’ Pepper and subsequent films such as Da Thadiya and 5 Sundarikkal. Eventually, he moved on to more significant characters. Maintaining that he was a director’s actor, Dileesh says with a laugh that being a director himself has not bestowed on him any special benefits while facing the camera.

“On the contrary, I feel that it has chipped away some of my confidence as an actor. I find it difficult to direct myself in my films and so I avoid taking on any major roles in my films as I feel my judgement might be flawed,” explains Dileesh.

He views acting stints with different directors as a learning experience and says it is an opportunity to see at close quarters how a director prepares an actor to breathe life into a character. “For instance, while working with Anwar, I made the most of the opportunity to observe his style of work. I am curious to learn how a director deciphers a scene, how he uses music....It was the same with Sathyan Anthikad too, another director I always wanted to work with. Each director has his specific style,” elaborates Dileesh.

As a director, he depends on his intuition and tries to imagine a particular character in his mind and casts a person that closely resembles that character. “Once, that is done, I have no idea what I do, perhaps, someone has to observe me...,” he laughs. Instead of aping a director, Dileesh explains that he observes, assimilates and then falls back on his strengths when he is working.

When it comes to selecting a subject for a film, he says it is topics that make us think that gives rise to a cinema. So, when there is a subject that piques his interest, he discusses it with his friends and, as a result, there might be stories or scenes that get developed. But, if, after a point, he loses interest, the idea is discarded.

Since his previous two films did so well, is he weighed down by expectations? “I always wanted to be a director. And I make films that I like. Making it big on the national scene or sweeping the box office are not the most important factors to make a film. I do not get excited about such things beyond a point. So a new film does not make me nervous. I am in no hurry to rush into one. But I am working towards it,” he explains.

He continues: “I understand that a box-office win is important from the point of view of business. It is important that an art form made by you is appreciated by people, that is every artist’s wish. But, all forms of art and films are not the same. I am not a magician to make films that will be appreciated or enjoyed by all. But each cinema, each angle, each perspective will be of a certain kind. So success does not scare me or make me nervous. It only gives me more confidence,” Dileesh says.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/6khkj2/article30819011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TVMDILEESH,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mollywood-actor-director-dileesh-pothan-on-why-his-role-in-upcoming-trance-is-a-new-experience/article30819016.ece

Filmmaker Matt Reeves has revealed the first look of Robert Pattinson as The Batman from his upcoming film about the iconic DC superhero.

#TheBatman#CameraTesthttps://t.co/M1tAE2aTA1 — Matt Reeves (@mattreevesLA) February 13, 2020

In the short clip, Pattinson, dressed as the caped crusader, is approaching towards the camera that is set in a dark room saturated in red light.

First capturing the superhero’s official logo on the chest, the camera then moves upward to show the actor with the iconic cowl. All this while, Michael Giacchino’s thunderous and emphatic score is ringing aloud in the background.

Pattinson is taking on a part that was previously played by the likes of Michael Keaton, George Clooney, Christian Bale and Ben Affleck, among others.

Joining him in the film are Paul Dano as The Riddler, Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman, Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon, Colin Farrell as Penguin and Peter Sarsgaard in a mystery role.

Giacchino, who previously collaborated with Reeves on Let Me In (2010), Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) and War for the Planet of the Apes (2017), is providing the background music.

204,2020/02/14,"‘Love Aaj Kal’ movie review: A tired, torturous and worn-out Valentine’s Day offering","With his love stories getting repetitive, banal and overwrought, it’s about time Imtiaz Ali discovered a new template for romance

There are some defined elements to identify any Imtiaz Ali film with. Journeys to self discovery and true love has been a perennial metaphor, in films like Socha Na Tha, Jab We Met and Jab Harry Met Sejal. Another arc is that of commitment-phobia, the angst accompanying the now on-now off relationship and the idea of a robotic work self pitted against one’s true actualisation. His new 2020 Love Aaj Kal follows the latter trope, is a marriage of the Ali’s film of the same name and the more recent Tamasha.

Two love stories — one set in 1990 Udaipur, other in 2020 Delhi — cross paths, the wisdom drawn from the one in the past, guiding the future course of the other. Interestingly, Ali situates the two at significant junctures, cinematically speaking: one is set in the times of Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (with a nod to the film as well), perhaps the last of the older brand of Bollywood romances that were about fighting the cruel society and family, rebelling and running away from the insensitive world. The second, set in 2020, is about lovers battling their own inner demons, as they have been in countless contemporary films.

The interesting departure is reimagining the role of the woman. For a change, in the new Love Aaj Kal, it’s the girl Zoe (Sara Ali Khan) who is trying to run away, from the secure and smothering love to establish a career for herself. Far from playing the supporting role, being the one to invest in a relationship and holding the mirror unto the hero, it’s for her to face the dilemmas of career and success and of love and commitment. Hero Veer (Kartik Aaryan) is content being the eternal pillar of patience.

Love Aaj Kal Director: Imtiaz Ali

Starring: Kartik Aaryan, Sara Ali Khan, Randeep Hooda, Arushi Sharma

Storyline: Two love stories: one set in 1990 Udaipur, and the other in 2020 Delhi cross paths, the wisdom drawn from the one in the past, guiding the future course of the other

Run time: 141 minutes

Great? Well, not at all. The work-love debate is handled in an utterly unconvincing, half-baked and clumsy manner. The 22-year-old girl has barely started off on her first assignment and you already have her wondering if she is happy or not. This is where Ali takes it all back to square one, makes it a guilt trip for her even as she is just on her mark to get set and go. There is an implicit apologetic touch in her opting for career over love in her early twenties. Pray why? She is rendered ditzy and unsure, the self-confidence notwithstanding. Commitment phobia is just as feebly handled as the quest for work-life balance and the resolution comes out of nowhere, way too easy, making you wonder why you were needlessly taken round and round in the circuitous plot.

The lack of conviction reflects even in the performances. Sara Ali Khan is perennially high-strung, scaled up several notches but without grounding her ostensible pain in any persuasive context. Other than an ambitious, materialistic mummy in the backdrop who herself has a scarred past. It renders Sara’s angst as designer as her home. Where is this anguish coming from, you wonder? Karthik Aaryan flares his nostrils, sports a cutesy pout and plays silly in trying to portray a supportive simpleton, be it Raghu of the past or the Veer of today. The only one who manages to anchor the film with relative gravitas is the older Raghu Randeep Hooda (the bridge between the past and the present, in a reprisal of the Rishi Kapoor part in the original), who has grown wiser from his past mistakes and misdemeanours but then he is confined to the margins than being in the centre of action.

Ali’s early films had a freshness and simplicity, a delightful irony underlying relationships, the warmth of characters and earthy humour. They made you connect because they were organic and spontaneous.

In the faux intensity and pointless philosophising of his newer lot of films (what with a co-working cafe here called Mazi, dropping names like Kabir and Rumi and an obsession with Lodi Road wall paintings and close up shots of the actors) the soul goes entirely missing and a turgidity underlines the telling. Emotions are either utterly inane or highly overwrought, the conversations alarmingly trite. Love swings between words like “compromise, underutilise, optimise” even as the audience is left rolling its eyes. At best, love feels torturous, tired and worn-out, and at its worst it becomes little more than a caricature. For the viewer, there is very little by way of options other than lapsing into sheer disinterest, boredom and exasperation.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4166kr/article30818688.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/love,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/love-aaj-kal-movie-review-a-tired-torturous-and-worn-out-valentines-day-offering/article30818689.ece
205,2020/02/14,People rejecting BJP for its policies: TPCC,"It is pushing the nation into economic crises, says TPCC treasurer

The Telangana Congress has said that people don’t judge political parties on their mode of campaign but on the policies being implemented by them and the BJP is being rejected across the country for its divisive policies and its poor management of the economy.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s contention that BJP lost the elections due to defective campaign is ridiculous and this is nothing but diverting people from its failures in the country, TPCC treasurer Gudur Narayan Reddy said.

The Congress leader said that the BJP government appears to be in a haste to bring contentious laws and make controversial moves so as to keep the attention of people to get diverted from real issues.

“The BJP-led Assam government has reportedly lost the data collected for the implementation of State-wide National Register of Citizens (NRC). The Central government had spent over ₹ 1600 crore to conduct the NRC in Assam on pilot basis. The data lost has badly damaged the credibility of NRC which is already facing widespread rejection all across the country,” he said in a statement here.

He said instead of being apologetic for pushing the country’s economy into huge crisis, BJP government is trying to find fault with the citizens.

Mr. Reddy said that only 1.5 crore out of 130 crore population pay Income Tax but almost everyone pays GST or other taxes, directly or indirectly but the Prime Minister Narender Modi is cursing Indians for not paying Income Tax properly.

Income Tax cannot be treated as the only benchmark to define a tax payer and almost 70% Indians pay taxes directly or indirectly through one way or the other, he said. “Instead of asking people to introspect, PM Modi and his team should do a serious introspection of their policies and approach towards economy,” he advised.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/people-rejecting-bjp-for-its-policies-tpcc/article30823800.ece

208,2020/02/14,Telangana HC seeks report on State’s steps to tackle COVID-19 outbreak,"Chief Secretary asked to file report by Feb. 26

Asking the Telangana government if it was geared up to tackle COVID-19, the Telangana High Court on Friday instructed the Chief Secretary to file a detailed report by February 26 on its preparedness to check the possible incidence and spread of the new virus in the State.

The issue of the SARS-CoV-2 virus cropped up during the hearing of two PIL pleas by a Bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy over spread of Swine Flu, Dengue, Malaria and other viral fevers breaking out in different parts of the State. While asking about the steps being taken by the government to contain the incidence of different viral fevers, the CJ observed that a new COVID-19 outbreak was reported in China.

“Unfortunately three cases of SARS-CoV-2 virus infected persons were reported in the country. It was of grave concern,” the Bench said. The challenge in the form of new virus from China had killed many people and had posed threat to the lives of thousands of people in other countries as well.

The Bench said the court wanted to know how the government was prepared to handle the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus though it was not part of the content of the two PIL petitions as it was spreading like wildfire. The CJ observed that persons returning from south east Asia or China were being screened at the airport and further being directed to get clearance from the doctors at the airport.

“But what about people who had already come from south east Asia or China and are travelling in Telangana by buses and trains?” the Bench sought to know. Buses and trains are easily accessible modes of transportation and some of those travellers would have travelled by them. How would they be subjected to foolproof screening for the new virus, the Bench asked.

Advocate General B.S. Prasad, assuring to comply with the direction on SARS-CoV-2 virus, informed the Bench that as per the data available with the government 44 cases of Swine Flu were detected in the State by January 24. No instances of Dengue were reported. Referring to SARS-CoV-2 virus, the AG replied that special and isolated wards to treat persons suspected to have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus were set up in government hospitals.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/umjdej/article30827623.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY15CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hc-seeks-report-on-states-steps-to-tackle-covid-19-outbreak/article30823479.ece
209,2020/02/14,16 workers returning from Iraq after KTR’s efforts,"Officials coordinate with Centre on repatriation

The efforts of Municipal Administration Minister K. T. Rama Rao in bringing back workers from the State stranded in Iraq have materialised with 16 workers set to return to the city on Saturday.

These workers and their families represented to the Minister about the hardships they were facing after leaving the country with the help of “fake agents”. Explaining that they were suffering for want of food and shelter, these workers urged Mr. Rama Rao to ensure their return to India.

Responding to the pleas, the Minister directed the officials of the Non Resident Indian affairs to extend necessary cooperation for these stranded workers to return at the earliest. The officials accordingly coordinated with the Centre and made arrangements to provide flight tickets for them. In addition, efforts were also made to get exemption to these workers from payment of overstay penalty imposed by the Kurdistan Regional Government amounting to around ₹2 crore. One of these workers who was indisposed had already reached the city on February 3 and the other 15 left Iraq on Friday.

According to an official release, the Minister directed the officials concerned to take steps to see that transport arrangements were made for these workers to reach their native places once they arrived here.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/16-workers-returning-from-iraq-after-ktrs-efforts/article30823335.ece
210,2020/02/14,Fiscal federalism is need of the hour: KTR,"‘Telangana’s growth model ideal for overcoming economic slowdown’

Information Technology Minister K.T. Rama Rao has called for ‘fiscal federalism’ stating that the Centre needs to give States more access to the capital and be liberal when it comes to Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) limits.

When the Union government talks about ‘Team India’ and ‘cooperative federalism’ it should also practise fiscal federalism and such bold decisions will only help in the dream of making India a five trillion economy, he said.

KTR expressed these views while participating in a discussion with Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani on ‘March to 5 Trillion Economy: Reality or Ambitious’ at the 28th Nasscom Technology and Leadership Forum 2020 in Mumbai on Friday.

Stating that India needs the three ‘I’ mantra — innovation, infrastructure and inclusive growth — he said the country has to do a lot more work when it comes to innovation sector. Think big and spend huge on infrastructure was KTR’s argument while he referred to how Telangana government spent around ₹1.60 lakh crore on capital expenditure during 2014-19.

State’s assets

KTR mentioned Kaleshwaram project and Mission Bhagiratha scheme on which the government had spent huge money in the last six years and said these projects would be huge assets for the State for years to come.

On inclusive growth, he said India’s growth should not be limited to cities; even smaller towns and villages have to be taken care of. He said that while cutting edge and emerging technologies can come up in big cities, the IT industry needs to shift its focus to tier-two cities.

To overcome the economic slowdown the country has been facing in the last two fiscal years, he said the country should look at the Telangana model. If the five trillion economy dream has to be achieved, country needs to grow at 10% and for this there should be more infusion into infrastructure.

Focus on sectors

During the debate, KTR said: “IT, banking, financial services, tourism, and hospitality are the sectors which can be further augmented with a well-planned strategy and the Government of India needs to focus on these sectors where the States can be allowed to play a larger role in tandem with the Centre.”

To compete with any large manufacturing economy, country needs to leverage its scale. He said Telangana was the only State that has come up with global scale projects like Pharma City and Kakatiya Mega Textile Park but the Centre has not extended any support despite several pleas for building these projects into world-class parks.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/g5r9we/article30823869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy15nascom,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/fiscal-federalism-is-need-of-the-hour-ktr/article30823314.ece

212,2020/02/14,AITUC terms the Budget as ‘hoax’,"Trade unions to stage protests from February 24

The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) has described the recently presented Union Budget as ‘hoax’ and said the budget introduced in Parliament was ‘directionless’.

The budget which favoured corporates in the form of tax concessions of 22% and 15% in two slabs, however, failed to provide relief to lower and middle income groups which were facing problems on account of price rise and other issues. In fact, subsidies to farmers were removed resulting in growing indebtedness among the ryots. “The Finance Minister played a cruel joke in claiming that the income of farmers will be doubled and falsely claimed that the debt burden of the country has been reduced,” AITUC general secretary Amarjeet Kaur said.

Speaking to reporters here on Friday, Ms. Kaur said the health sector had been pushed towards privatisation in the name of public private partnership mode and the budgetary allocations to education sector were aimed at attracting foreign direct investments without any commitment for the betterment of the government sector education.

Privatisation of education

The new education policy was actually aimed at privatisation and commercialisation of education excluding vast majority of poor and lower middle class families from its ambit. The spending on social sector had been reduced as also the budgetary allocation to the MGNREGA and other social welfare schemes.

The announcement on allowing private sector to build data centre parks had hidden dangers of exposing the people to all kinds of intimidations as well as misuse of data by market forces. The Finance Minister who started her budget speech claiming that people voted for development ought to explain as to why the Central government was focussing on tactics of division and hatred among different sections.

Labour code

The central trade unions in their joint meeting on February 6 decided to launch campaign against the “anti-people policies” of the government. Accordingly, it was decided to stage protests against codification of labour laws at factory/enterprise levels between February 24 and March 2. This would be followed by publicly burning the copies of labour codes as and when the relevant bills were introduced in the Lok Sabha, she said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/rkea1e/article30823249.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY15AMARJEETKAUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/aituc-terms-the-budget-as-hoax/article30823251.ece
213,2020/02/14,Low prices dash hopes of turmeric farmers,"Actual price would be decided after the harvest picks up, says trader

Hopes of turmeric farmers are getting dashed year-after-year with the continuous falling of the market price for the crop. Existing price per quintal in the beginning of trading season in February itself is disappointing.

The current price in the agriculture marketyard here is ₹4,400 to ₹5,400 per quintal for finger (fine) variety and for bulb variety it is ₹4,200 to ₹5,100. This is ₹500 to ₹600 below the price of what both the varieties fetched in the last season. Whether the price would be stable or vary depends on the crop yield. “We would be able to tell only after Sivaratri festival as harvest is slow now. We can assess depending on the quality and quantity,” director of Pradeep Traders Limited Sandeep Akula said.

In practice the farmers did not benefit financially with the eNAM (electronic national agriculture market), but it could contain irregularities in the market. However, it did not enable turmeric farmers to sell their produce to upcountry traders. “There would be several varieties and qualities of crop. Hence, unless traders come physically and check the varieties they cannot purchase the crop,” said Mr. Sandeep.

Heavy rainfall during the kharif damaged the crop and therefore low yield is expected. Crop would keep coming till May first week. The district accounts for 30 % of the total crop in the country. It is mainly exported to Middle East and Bangladesh. Contrary to the reports that the outbreak out of Covid-19 badly impacted the international market the traders here said that the impact is very little as they do not export to China.

On the other hand, farmers complained that compared to last year price has fallen at least by ₹1,000 per quintal this season. They appealed to State government to follow the lead of AP government, which assured ₹6,850 per quintal instead of waiting for the decision of the Centre on minimum support price for turmeric.

In AP the government is paying the difference between the actual sale price (between ₹4,500 and ₹5,500 per quintal) and the assured price on basis of certification by tahsildar, they said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/59qedm/article30823211.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY15TURMERIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/low-prices-dash-hopes-of-turmeric-farmers/article30823212.ece

218,2020/02/14,AAP threatens to cut power supply to Punjab CM’s residence,"Party seeks cancellation of power purchase pact with firms

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday said that if the Congress government failed to cancel the power purchase agreements with private power companies during the upcoming Budget session, the party along with people of State would cut-off power of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh’s residence in Patiala.

The decision was taken during a meeting of the party MLAs here. The meeting was chaired by Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema.

Mr. Cheema said the remarkable victory of the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi Assembly polls was clearly visible not only in Punjab but across the country and abroad, for it was a vote for ‘performance’ and against the communal and divisive forces.

“The stupendous victory had shown thumbs down to the fascist forces and decimated the Congress to zero, which would be replicated in Punjab as well,” he said.

Mr. Cheema said that the Badal’s of Akali Dal, accused of being hand in glove with the mafia raj and the desecration incidents in the State, too had been isolated by their long time ally — the BJP. He asserted that the Kejriwal development model on which the elections in Delhi were fought and won would be replicated in Punjab when it goes to the polls in 2022.

Mr. Cheema said if the government did not provide relief to the people from high power tariff, the AAP would be forced to cut the electricity connection of Captain Amarinder Singh’s residence in Patiala — the Moti Mahal.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/eaczwc/article30824440.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE14-CHEEMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/aap-threatens-to-cut-power-supply-to-punjab-cms-residence/article30824441.ece

The Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja and senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala on Friday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of hatching a conspiracy to attack the Constitution and abrogate the right of reservation in government jobs for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.

The Congress leaders also hit out at the BJP-led government at the Centre over “unanswered questions” regarding the Pulwama terror attack.

“The BJP and the RSS have an anti-Dalit, anti-adivasis and anti-Backward Classes mindset, which has resulted in rise in atrocities against them in the last few years,” said Ms. Selja and Mr. Surjewala at a joint press conference here.

On the Pulwama terror attack, Mr. Surjewala said there are several unanswered questions. “Why is government not making the report public about the Pulwama attack. Who and how the 350 kg RDX and IED were brought?,” he asked.

220,2020/02/14,Brother of CAA violence victim files complaint against police,"‘Aleem killed by bullet fired by Meerut policemen on Dec. 20’

Mohd Salauddin, brother of Aleem, one of the five persons who lost their lives in Meerut after the protest against the amended citizenship law turned violent on December 20, 2019, has lodged a complaint against the Meerut police alleging that Aleem was killed in police firing. He has also purportedly attached video evidence with the complaint to prove that the police took Aleem to hospital in their vehicle.

Local news reports suggested that the district administration had been maintaining that the mortal remains of Aleem were left by unidentified people in the government hospital. DM Anil Dhingra had ordered a magisterial inquiry in the case.

In the complaint addressed to the DM and the SSP, Mr. Salauddin has named 20 policemen, including the SHO of Nauchandi police station Ashutosh Kumar, for planning to shoot at the protesters.

“Aleem was returning home from the hotel, where he worked, after shops were shut down when the protests started on December 20. When Aleem was near the City Hospital, he was hit by a bullet in the head fired by the policemen of Nauchandi police station,” alleged Mr. Salauddin in the complaint.

The locals, he said, took him to the City Hospital which refused to provide treatment to his brother and he died at the hospital. “Locals put his body on the road. Policemen came after some time and took the body to the government medical hospital and got his post-mortem done,” claimed Salauddin in the complaint.

“I have collected this information and evidence on my own. I didn’t reach out to the police earlier because of fear,” said Mr Salauddin. “The police took a long time in giving us the post-mortem report. Now, policemen in plainclothes threaten us to make peace with what is left with us, otherwise we will be in for a long haul,” he alleged.

Supreme Court lawyer Ali Zaidi, who is representing Mr. Salauddin, said the police were “misleading” the inquiry on the basis of bogus evidence. “If the district administration doesn’t register an FIR, we will approach the court.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/brother-of-caa-violence-victim-files-complaint-against-police/article30824424.ece
221,2020/02/14,U.P. Opposition seeks judicial probe into deaths in anti-CAA clashes,"Firing by police and BJP men behind casualties, alleges SP in Assembly

The Opposition on Friday demanded a judicial probe into deaths during the anti-CAA protests in Uttar Pradesh, with the Samajwadi Party (SP) alleging that the casualties were caused in firing by police and BJP men.

The demand was raised in the State Assembly during the Zero Hour, when Opposition parties also pressed for a discussion on the issue.

Opposition MLAs walked into the Well of the House, creating a ruckus, when Speaker Hriday Narayan Dixit turned down the notice for a discussion. The House was then adjourned for 30 minutes.

The SP sought a probe by a sitting Supreme Court or High Court judge into the deaths during the protests against the new citizenship law.

The Bahujan Samaj Party said a High Court judge should investigate.

“Hindus and Muslims fought together for the freedom of the country. Those who fought for freedom are being termed deshdrohi (traitors) while those who supported the British have become rashtrawadi (nationalists),” Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chowdhury said while demanding a discussion.

“During the anti-CAA protests, only Muslims were killed,” he said and claimed that there was firing by police and BJP men during the peaceful protests.

About 20 people were killed, mostly due to gunshot wounds, during protests in Uttar Pradesh on December 20 over the Citizenship Amendment Act.

In the Assembly, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna backed the police version that the deaths were not the result of police firing.

‘Blankets taken away’

222,2020/02/14,Three-time Odisha MLA ‘confesses’ to double murder,"Anup Sai accused of killing a woman, minor daughter.

The Chhattisgarh Police on Friday claimed that three-time Odisha MLA Anup Sai confessed to committing murder of a woman and her minor daughter in the year 2016.

Mr. Sai was produced before a local court in Raigad district of Chhattisgarh. He was subsequently remanded to judicial custody. Addressing a press conference, Raigad SP Santosh Kumar Singh said Chhattisgarh police talked to 700 people and pieced together the facts behind the murder before arresting Mr. Sai.

“Despite having a family, the accused had developed a relationship with the woman identified as Kalpana Das. They were living happily together in Bhubaneswar until demand for marriage arose from the deceased woman. Worried over the development which could spoil his political career and family life, Sai decided to finish her off,” said Raigad SP Santosh Kumar Singh.

The mutilated body of the woman and her 14-year-old daughter was found along the Hamirpur road in Raigad district on May 7, 2016. According to Raigad police, it was difficult to make progress in investigation from an unidentified body.

“We subsequently sent her photographs to six States. One of the distant relatives of woman identified her after one year... From the call details retrieved, we came to know that the woman was in regular touch with the former MLA. Despite our repeated intimations to be present before the investigating team, he avoided us,” he said. The investigating team caught Mr. Sai in Odisha’s Jharsuguda district.

Sai confessed that he had taken the woman and her daughter in the pretext of marrying her to Raigad district, where he attacked them with an iron rod and ran his vehicle over their bodies several times, said Mr. Singh.

Mr. Sai was elected to Odisha Legislative Assembly thrice on a Congress ticket. He had joined the Biju Janata Dal in 2014.

He had held the post of Chairman of Odisha State Warehousing Corporation. The Naveen Patnaik Government removed him from the post following his arrest. Hewas also expelled from the party.

223,2020/02/14,"Post August 5, J&K banks harassing us, say Kashmir-based trader bodies","At least 21 Kashmir-based traders bodies on Friday, in full-page advertisements published in local dailies, accused the banks of harassment and persecution of the families of the borrowers in the name of asset possession, first such allegations since J&K was reduced to a Union Territory.

“After 2019, the business community is completely devastated and exhausted. Our survival is under threat. It’s a humble submission to banks that they should stop calling us defaulters. Many are circumstantial and not wilful defaulters,” reads the joint statement.

Among others that issued the statement, included Kashmir’s top trading bodies such as the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI), the Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers Federation, Kashmir Economic Alliance, the Federation Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kashmir Hotel and Restaurant Association, the J&K Private School Coordination Committee, the Shopian Fruit Mandi Association, the Kashmir Gold Association etc.

“We and our families don’t deserve to be harassed, persecuted and troubled. Dear banks, be humble and compassionate while making recoveries,” the statement said.

Several sectors that drives the J&K economy — tourism, horticulture, IT-related units and handicrafts — witnessed a major slump after the Centre ended J&K’s special status on August 5 last year. Besides the unprecedented security measures, the non- availability of the Internet further dented economy.

“Since 2008, businesses in Kashmir suffered heavy losses. It was followed by the 2014 floods, 2016 unrest and the 2019 clampdown. The RBI has allowed the banks to go for restructuring and rehabilitation of stress accounts to save them from turning into non performing assets. This turned out to be half-hearted acknowledgement. After 2019, business community is completely devastated,” it said.

The KCCI already claimed that J&K suffered losses to the tune of ₹17,878 crore, with the agriculture sector topping the list at ₹2,827 crore followed by tourism at ₹2,615 crore after the Centre’s move.

A top trader told The Hindu that of late, the officials of the banks, unlike the past, are accompanied with security personnel and sealed properties on the spot. “It was not a trend in the past. It’s an attack on Kashmir business class,” he said on the condition of anonymity.

No bank has responded to these allegations. The J&K Bank, which is the main lender in J&K, also remained silent over the trader bodies’ allegations.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2g79gu/article30825608.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KCCIjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/post-aug5-jk-banks-harassing-us/article30823698.ece
224,2020/02/14,EU for swift end to all curbs in Kashmir,"A team of 25 European diplomats visited Kashmir and Jammu on Feb. 12 to 13

The European Union (EU) has called for swift removal of communication and political restrictions in Kashmir. The organisation was in touch with the Indian authorities for continuing dialogue regarding the situation in Kashmir, a spokesperson for the EU said.

“Some restrictions remain, notably on Internet access and mobile services, and some political leaders are still in detention. While we recognise the serious security concerns, it is important that the remaining restrictions are lifted swiftly”, said Virginie Battu-Henriksson, EU Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

The statement was issued a day after a delegation of 25 diplomats that included the EU Ambassador to India Ugo Astuto and several other European envoys visited Kashmir and Jammu from February 12 to 13. The delegation was not part of the earlier team of diplomats that visited Kashmir in January as they had insisted on meeting jailed political leaders.

However, two former Chief Ministers of the erstwhile State - Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti -- were booked under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) days before the latest diplomatic delegation visited Kashmir. A diplomatic source earlier told The Hindu that they interacted with diverse sections of the Kashmiri civil society and witnessed heavy security presence in Srinagar where the threat of terror attacks persist, six months after India ended the special status of the region.

“The visit confirmed that the Government of India has taken positive steps to restore normalcy...The visit presented a welcome opportunity to see the situation on the ground and to interact with local interlocutors”, said the EU spokesperson.

In recent months, India's relation with the EU has been marked by growing concern of the powerful regional body over the Kashmir situation, the controversial new Indian citizenship law andNational Register of Citizens. In January, 626 of the 751 members of the EU Parliament took up six resolutions for discussion but ultimately postponed a vote on the matters till coming spring.

226,2020/02/14,"U.P. police didn’t identify age of those held during anti-CAA protests, say activists","In cases where it was obvious that those held were minors, the police deliberately did not record their details in FIRs, they allege

The Uttar Pradesh police either made no attempt to identify the age of those held during the anti-CAA protests or deliberately skipped recording their details in FIRs, allege activists after the Supreme Court ordered the Union government and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to submit a report within three weeks on ‘illegal detention of children in jails’.

The Supreme Court on Monday observed that the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, laid down that a child in conflict with law “shall not be placed in a police lock-up or lodged in a jail”, adding that they have to be handed over to a special juvenile police unit (SJPU) or child welfare committee (CWC), who must produce them before a juvenile justice board immediately. The court demanded a report from the Centre, the NCPCR and its arms in Delhi and U.P.

“During our visit to U.P., we found that the police made no effort to verify the age of those detained. Worse, in cases where it was obvious that those held were minors the police deliberately did not record their details in FIRs”, says Bharti Ali, co-founder, HAQ: Centre for Child Rights. She says neither a school certificate was sought nor bone-ossification test seems to have been conducted to determine the age of the detainees as mandated under law. “The entire child protection system, comprising SJPUs, CWCs were found missing in action in U.P. as they failed to enquire into the whereabouts of the children”, she adds.

Ms Ali was a part of a joint team from NGOs HAQ, Quill Foundation and Citizens Against Hate that conducted a fact-finding probe in U.P. and recorded the testimonies of juvenile victims, their families and eye-witnesses describing the ‘torture meted out to children in police custody’. The investigation was conducted between January 10 and 24 in the districts of Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar and Firozabad. The report made public on Thursday says children were denied water, access to toilets, brutally beaten up and shown videos of adult detainees being hit in order to instill fear in them.

Muzaffarnagar

Syed Asad Raza Hussaini, principal and founder of a local madrasa, says police raided his institute and picked up all 50 students. As many as 14 students were under 18 years. Of these four were challaned and released after 12 days. “One student was rolled around a drum and hit on his legs- smashing his knee. He had to spend Rs 1.2 lakh on a surgery. Many had arms broken, all have beating marks and bruises all over their body”, says the report.

He adds that when ‘raids’ took place, students were observing a fast, but they were denied water to break their fast and faced derogatory comments on their religion. “They were forced to say Jai Shri Ram”, the principal allegedly told the team.

Nagina, Bijnore

“Those were the most terrifying moments”, says a mother after her son suddenly disappeared. Her 16-17-year-old son was among 22 allegedly picked up by the police from a protest site and detained for two days. The detainees were allegedly moved from the police station to a BJP MLA's house. “My son and other boys were forced to stay awake the whole night and if somebody fell asleep, they had to face merciless beatings. Although, they were allowed to drink water, if anybody requested for toilet, they got beaten up. My son was also beaten up black and blue and his toes were crushed with the boots worn by the policemen and batons,"" the report says.

A 20-year-old says that when the police detained him, a 14-year-old and a 16-year-old were also picked up along with him.""While one police official held the hands of the detainees, the other police official was raining lathi blows mercilessly on bare bodies”. He adds that a police official made a video call to his colleague to show them live visuals of other people being stripped naked and subjected to ruthless beatings. ﻿

227,2020/02/14,Gujarat hostel asks girls to prove that they are not menstruating,"Students were told to remove their undergarments.

At least 60 girls in a hostel in Gujarat’s Kutch were allegedly asked to remove their undergarments to prove that they were not menstruating, after complaints that girls having periods had entered the temple and kitchen in the premises.

The hostel is part of the Shree Sahajanand Girls Institute (SSGI), run by a trust of the Swaminarayan Temple. The hostel rector and college principal are reported to have given instructions for the checking on Tuesday.

Shocked and humiliated, some girls complained to local media in Bhuj, Kutch, on Thursday. Girls in the hostel are mostly from villages of Kutch district. “What has happened is condemnable,” said the institute’s trustee Pravin Pindoria.

However, some hostel authorities have defended the sect’s norms on keeping away menstruating women from the temple and the kitchen.

A student said the incident took place in the hostel located on the campus of the SSGI, which offers graduate and undergraduate courses.

Inquiry ordered

The State Women’s Commission has ordered an inquiry and a team has been formed by Kutch University, to which the institute is affiliated.

“I have spoken to the local police regarding the incident and strong action will be initiated,” said State Women’s Commission chairperson Leela Ankolia. The National Commission for Women has also sought a report.

“We have sent a police team under a woman inspector to talk to the girls and are in the process of filing an FIR. Though the girls are not ready to come forward, we are confident that at least one girl will come forward to lodge an FIR,” Kutch West Superintendent of Police Saurabh Tolumbia said.

A group of youths shouting slogans in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram’ have been pelting stones, throwing slippers, eggs, inks and engine oil at Mr. Kumar’s convoy in different places during the last two-weeks.

Mr. Kumar, alongwith Congress party MLA Shakeel Ahmed and his supporters and party leaders, had started his yatra from Bhitiharwa Gandhi Ashram in West Champaran district from January 30 and is scheduled to conclude on February 27 at Patna’s historic Gandhi Maidan.

While stating that the decision to grant consent for the transfer of the Elgaar Parishad case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) was entirely the prerogative of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar took a veiled jibe at Mr. Thackeray, remarking that the Maharashtra government’s decision was “improper”.

“We felt that role of the Pune police in the Elgaar Parishad probe was objectionable. Under the Constitution, law and order is a State topic…It was not proper for the Central government to take over the investigation from the State in the first place. It is even more improper for the Maharashtra government to grant consent for this transfer,” Mr. Pawar said, speaking in Kolhapur on Friday.

Following the formation of the new ‘Maha Vikas Aghadi’ government in Maharashtra with the unlikely coalition of the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress, it was Mr. Pawar who, on January 10, wrote to the Chief Minister urging the constitution of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) after publicly casting aspersions of the Pune police’s investigations in the case, which saw the arrest of prominent intellectuals, academics, lawyers and activists charged with alleged links to the Maoists.

After the MVA government initiated a review a few days later to probe the actions of the Pune police, the BJP government at the Centre swiftly acted with the Union Home Ministry on January 24 issuing an order transferring the case from the Pune police to the NIA.

“The State [MVA] government had a meeting on the issue [setting up of SIT to probe Pune police] between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. The same day at 3 p.m., the Centre abruptly issues a notification directing the NIA to take over the case…while this process itself is improper, the Maharashtra government supporting it is even more improper,” said Mr. Pawar.

The NCP chief’s sharp reaction against his new ally, Mr. Thackeray, came a day after NCP leader and State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh claimed to have been allegedly “overruled” by the Chief Minister in the decision to grant consent to the NIA to take over the Elgaar Parishad case.

The issue could prove to be a source of possible fractiousness between the Sena and the NCP, with the latter being opposed to the transfer of the case records to the NIA.

However, responding to another question pertaining to alleged rifts within the MVA’s coordination committee, which comprises leaders from the three ideologically opposed parties, Mr. Pawar said that all was well and there were no problems among the Sena, the NCP and the Congress.

231,2020/02/14,Assam party sounds U.N. on validity of CAA,"Petition was in view of the “grave danger” from CAA “to the identity and existence of the indigenous people” of Northeast, say its office-bearers

A newly-formed political party in Assam has petitioned the United Nations for evaluating the compliance of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) to the international human right instruments and its validity under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The Asom Songrami Mancha had on February 5 sent formal letters separately to the High Commissioner of the Geneva-based UN High Commission for Human Rights (UNHCR), its Chief of Mission in India and the Chairperson of the Indigenous Peoples and Development Branch of the UN’s Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (SPFII).

Mancha president Diganta Konwar, its working president Adip Kumar Phukan and three others said their petition was in view of the “grave danger” from the recently promulgated the CAA “to the identity and existence of the indigenous people” of Northeast India, specifically Assam.

They sought the intervention of the SPFII for considering the validity of the CAA under the spirit of Universal Declaration of Human Rights and for issuing refugee certificate to all eligible religiously-persecuted persons without any discrimination under the supervision of the UNHCR.

The Mancha asked the UNHCR and SPFII to ensure that the language, culture, demographics and economic well-being of the indigenous population of Assam are protected as per the principles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

The Mancha reminded the U.N. that India voted to adopt the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and was a signatory to a number of U.N. and world conventions on human rights, refugee issues and related matters although the country did not sign the 1951 Convention on Refugees and the 1967 Protocol.

“The CAA legitimises discrimination on the basis of religion and stands in clear violation of the Constitution of India and international human rights laws. The Act, while inclusive in its stated objective, is exclusionary in its structure and intent,” the Mancha’s petition said.

‘Debilitating scenarios’

It also outlined two “debilitating scenarios” because of the CAA. One, it might have a devastating impact on the Northeast, totally destabilising its socio-economic balance and ethnic identity besides burdening Assam with “illegal migrants”. Two, anti-Hindu sentiments might increase in the neighbouring Islamic countries of India, making life for affluent Hindus there harder.

The CAA fast-tracks the citizenship process for six non-Muslim communities who allegedly fled religious persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan and took refuge in India till December 31, 2014.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/qokvrt/article30819711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CAAASSAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-party-sounds-un-on-validity-of-caa/article30819712.ece
232,2020/02/14,Recovery notices issued to 13 in Lucknow,"ADM gives them 30 days to deposit the penalty amount, either collectively or by a single person.

The court of Additional Disrict Magistrate in Lucknow has issued notices to recover ₹21.76 lakh from 13 persons accused of damaging public and private property in the vandalism and arson that took place during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Fixing culpability of the 13 persons, ADM (Trans Gomti) Vishwa Bhushan Mishra has given them 30 days to deposit the penalty amount, either collectively or by a single person.

The district administration had issued notices to 20 persons to recover damage to property, but charges were fixed only against 13.

The remaining seven were exonerated from paying the damages as the police could not provide evidence that they were present at the protest site in Khadra locality with “common object” on December 19, the notice said.

Of the remaining 13, seven could not prove that they had no role in damaging the property, while six did not reply to the notice, the ADM order said.

Stay on notice

Meanwhile, the Allahabad High Court has directed a stay on a recovery notice issued to a Kanpur resident, Mohammad Faizan, by the administration, offering him “ad-interim protection”.

The petitioner had filed the writ challenging a notice issued to him on January 1 by the ADM City Kanpur to deposit the stipulated amount towards damage to public property. The High Court said the matter related to issuing notices to alleged vandals was already being heard in the Supreme Court.

“We are of the view that the Rules under which impugned notice has been issued is under challenge before the Apex Court, therefore the ends of justice demand that the effect and operation of the impugned notice is put in abeyance till the issue is determined by the Apex Court”, the court said.

It directed the government to file a counter affidavit within a month and listed the matter in the week commencing April 20.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/yo7fo8/article30819640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LUCKNOWCAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/recovery-notices-issued-to-13-in-lucknow/article30819641.ece

234,2020/02/14,"NSA slapped on Gorakhpur doctor Kafeel Khan, says family","He allegedly made inflammatory and provocative comments at Aligarh Muslim University

The Uttar Pradesh government has slapped the National Security Act (NSA) on Dr. Kafeel Khan of Gorakhpur for his alleged inflammatory and provocative comments against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) at Aligarh Muslim University recently.

Dr. Khan was booked under the stringent law on the day he was expected to be released on bail from the Mathura jail, where he was lodged after his arrest in the case on January 29

Dr. Khan's family said he was being targetted by the Yogi Adityanath government for his activism, as despite being granted bail by a CJM court in Aligarh on February 10, he continued to languish in jail without a proper reason.

SP (crime) Aligarh Arvind Kumar told The Hindu that Dr. Khan was booked under the NSA by the district administration.

Superintendent of Mathura jail Shailendra Maitri said the jail received Dr. Khan's release orders at 8 p.m. on Thursday and that he was due to be released on Friday morning.

In his order, District Magistrate (DM) Aligarh Chandrabhushan Singh said it was necessary to book Dr. Khan under the NSA to prevent him from doing acts against “maintenance of public order”.

In a letter to the district administration, the Aligarh police said there was a “strong possibility” of Dr. Khan causing a serious threat to public order if he returned to AMU.

If Dr. Kafeel is “released from jail, then he will certainly impact the peace and communal harmony in Aligarh by instigating students”, wrote SSP Akash Kulhary to the DM.

Dr. Khan, who was arrested by the State’s Special Task Force from the Mumbai airport, has been under suspension from the Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College in Gorakhpur since the oxygen tragedy of 2017.

An FIR was lodged against him on December 13 in Aligarh under Section 153-A of the Indian Penal Code (promoting enmity between different groups). Section s 153 b, 505 (2) and 109 of the IPC were added later during investigation.

According to the FIR, Dr. Khan provoked the religious sentiments of Muslim students of AMU while addressing a gathering of around 600 students on December 12 on the CAA. He tried to spread hatred among the Muslim students of AMU towards Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs and Christians coming under the ambit of the CAA, the FIR alleged.

Brother’s charge

Dr. Khan's brother Adeel Khan accused the government of witch-hunt against him for highlighting alleged discrepancies in the BRD hospital. When the Mathura jail authorities did not release him despite the bail, his family moved the CJM court in Aligarh, which then directed them to expedite the release.

“After the CJM directed the jail to release him, the same evening the Aligarh administration booked Kafeel under the NSA. We were told about it on Friday at 9 a.m.”, Mr. Adeel said.

“The government wants to keep him in jail on false charges and not allow him to speak regarding the BRD issue”, said Mr. Adeel, adding that his brother had expressed threat to his life outside the Bandra court where he appeared after his arrest.

Mr. Adeel said they would challenge the slapping of the NSA on Dr. Khan in the High Court.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jtnkkc/article29528483.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN27KAFEELKHAN-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nsa-slapped-against-gorakhpur-doctor-kafeel-khan-says-family/article30817667.ece
235,2020/02/14,"Five months after CBI's request, Maharashtra govt. gives approval to sanction four police officers charged in a land grab case","Nearly five months after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) sought the State government’s sanction to prosecute four officers of the Mumbai police for their involvement in a land grab case, Maharashtra Government accorded its approval for the same on Thursday. The four officers to be prosecuted include an officer of the rank of former Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), who is alleged to have forcibly evicted a developer from a 16-acre plot worth ₹60 crores at Dahisar in 2017. The sanction for prosecution of the public servants was signed by Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday night.

Sources in the government said the case is up for a hearing on February 17 in the Bombay High Court and political leadership in the state did not want to take a chance by delaying the permissions further. The CBI too would not be functioning over the weekend so it was important to accord the sanctions before the weekend. “This (weekday) was the only window open for us to to give an approval and forward the same to the CBI before the court hearing,” said a source in the government.

A court ordered CBI probe had found the public servants guilty as per provisions of Section-19(1)(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and demanded a Sanction under sanction 197 (1) (b) of the CrPC in respect of offences under the PC Act and the IPC respectively, officials said.

The CBI had said the officers had shown ‘high handedness’ in dealing with the directors of Rommell Housing LLP which had purchased the land at Dahisar Check Naka from two private firms. The CBI had further alleged the grandson of one of the claimant on the land had alleged theft and dacoity in a police FIR at Dahisar Police Station, as result of which the directors Jude and Dominic Romell were arrested and thrown behind bars. A bail was given to Jude Romell in 2017.

The duo then approached the Bombay High Court to seek a remedy against the ""malafide"" FIR and accused the four officers of showing ‘high handedness’ in dealing with them. The court ordered an enquiry by official of the rank of Joint Commissioner of Police and directed the government to suspend the four officers in September last year. The CBI finally late last year registered an FIR and demanded approval for sanction against four officers including ACP (now retired) Prashant Marde, senior police inspector Subhash Sawant, then Assistant Police Inspector Anand Jadhav and Sub Inspector Kakasaheb Shinde.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/five-months-after-cbis-request-maharashtra-govt-gives-approval-to-sanction-four-police-officers-charged-in-a-land-grab-case/article30817352.ece

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday removed former MLA Anup Sai from the post of Chairman of the Odisha State Warehousing Corporation after the Chhattisgarh police had arrested him in connection with a murder case.

Mr. Sai was allegedly involved in the murder of a mother-daughter duo. He was elected thrice as MLA of the Brajarajnagar constituency in Jharsuguda district on Congress ticket before switching sides to the BJD.

The bodies of the woman (32) and her daughter (14) were found in the Raigad district in neighbouring Chhattisgharh in 2016. It was alleged that the bodies were dumped there to muddle the investigation process.

According to the Chhattisgarh police, Mr. Sai was avoiding appearing before the investigating team despite several intimations. A team of Chhattisgarh had finally picked him up from near his residence on Wednesday.

After preliminary interrogation, he was formally arrested and booked under Sections 302 and 201 of the IPC on Thursday.

238,2020/02/14,"Assam’s move to shut madrasas, Sanskrit tols draws criticism","Hindu, Muslim organisations reject decision, ask govt. to focus on regular schools

The Assam government’s decision to shut down all State-run madrasas (Muslim theological schools) and tols (ashrams teaching Sanskrit and religious scriptures) and convert them into high schools and higher secondary schools has come in for sharp criticism.

State Education and Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had on Wednesday said that madrasas and tols run or funded by the government would be restructured as regular schools within five months. This was because “it’s not a secular government’s job to provide religious education”. He, however, made it clear that the decision would not affect the madrasas and the tols run by individuals or NGOs. He also said teachers handling scriptures and other religious education in these institutions would continue to be employed till retirement but not teach the subjects.

The decision has not gone down well with the minority and Hindu organisations.

“The BJP-run government is trying to show its secular face by washing its hands off Sanskrit tols along with madrasas. Leave apart madrasas, we are not in favour of such treatment towards Sanskrit, the mother of most languages on earth,” said Aminul Islam, general secretary of All India United Democratic Front. Mr. Islam said the government should rather think about regular schools that are dying because of lack of students and filling up of the 47,000 vacant posts of teachers across the State.

‘Against Constitution’

The All Assam Minority Students’ Union said Mr. Sarma’s move was in keeping with the agenda of “harassing Muslims and denying them basic rights” guaranteed by the Constitution. “Madrasas don’t only teach Islamic scriptures and Arabic, they also teach subjects like any regular school,” it said in a statement.

A group of satradhikars (monastic heads) on Majuli have criticised the decision too. Majuli has 32 satras or Vaishnav monasteries adhering to the teachings of the 15th century saint-reformer Srimanta Sankaradeva and 10 of these have Sanskrit tols.

“Sanskrit is part of our culture. We cannot accept this decision,” said Janardhan Deva Goswami, the satradhikar of the Dakhinpat Satra in Majuli, which is also Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal’s Assembly constituency.

The State Madrasa Education Board recognises 614 madrasas in Assam.

240,2020/02/14,Centre-State tussle mars East-West Metro project inauguration in Kolkata,"Mamata skips the event as her name wasn’t mentioned in the invitation card

The inauguration of the first phase of the East-West Metro corridor here on Thursday was marred by a boycott by the West Bengal government.

Railway Minister Piyush Goyal inaugurated the 4.88-km stretch of the mega infrastructure project, connecting Sector V with the Salt Lake Stadium, but there were no representatives either from the Bengal government or from the Trinamool Congress at the event.

‘No mention in invite’

The absence found a mention in the speech of Mr. Goyal and Union Minister of State Babul Supriyo. Earlier in the day, Mayor and State’s Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim had said it was “indecent” on the part of the Centre not to mention the name of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in the invitation card of the project.

Mr. Hakim said the project and other metro projects in the city were conceived by Ms. Banerjee herself. The invitation card, however, had the names of Barasat MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, MLA of Salt Lake and State Fire Minister Sujit Bose and Mayor of Biddhannagar Municipal Corporation Krishna Bose who also did not turn up.

At the inauguration event, the Railway Minister said the entire stretch of the project would be completed in the next two years. The metro services along the truncated route will be open to the public from Friday. Mr. Goyal also said compared to the other parts of the country, the eastern region has lagged in development and it is high time the States realised their potential.

The 16.6-km project will connect the Howrah Maidan on the other side of river Hooghly to Rajarahat Newtown in the northeastern fringes of the city. This is also the country’s first underwater Metro project. Tunnelling about 13 metres under the riverbed was successfully completed in 2017. Of the entire stretch, the elevated corridor is 5.8 km long, while the underground stretch measures 10.8 km.

The project, which had suffered inordinate delays due to route change last year, met another road block in September 2019 when several houses collapsed during underground tunnelling in the Bowbazar area. Tunnelling had to be stopped and hundreds of families had to be moved to a safe location. Earlier this week, the Calcutta High Court allowed tunnelling to resume.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/inw9f/article30815026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE14EAST-WESTMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/centre-state-tussle-mars-east-west-metro-project-inauguration/article30815027.ece

After a panel headed by the Additional District Magistrate held 53 guilty of damaging public property during an Anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest in Muzaffarnagar on December 20, 2019 on Wednesday, the lawyer representing 17 of them has decided to move the Allahabad High Court.

ADM (City) Amit Kumar has directed the revenue department to recover ₹23. 41 lakh from the guilty.

“The administration is working towards instilling fear among the marginalised. Most of those held guilty are rickshaw-pullers and daily wage earners. They cannot afford legal fees, how would they pay the fine? We will move the High Court,” said advocate Mannan Baliyan.

He hopes to get a stay as the Allahabad High Court has granted ad-interim protection to a petitioner from Kanpur who was served recovery notice by the U.P. government to compensate the damage caused to public property.

“Such notices were issued across the State in an arbitrary and random manner,” said advocate Ali Qambar Zaidi, who argued for Mohd. Faizan in the High Court.

Mr. Zaidi said in a previous judgment the Supreme Court had provided the power to compute damages and investigate liability for the destruction of public property to a serving/retired High Court Judge or retired District Judge as a Claims Commissioner. “So, the Additional District Magistrate is not the competent authority,” he said.

243,2020/02/14,Stand against NPR unchanged: M.P. govt.,"A notification enabling NPR update issued before CAA was passed still in force

Madhya Pradesh Law Minister P.C. Sharma on Thursday reiterated the Congress government’s resolve against carrying out the National Population Register (NPR) update, even though the enumeration exercise in the State remains scheduled from May.

According a the State government notification dated December 9 and published in the gazette on December 13, a day after the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) received the President’s assent to come into force, the update of the NPR will be undertaken along with houselisting exercise from May 1 to June 14, 2020, a plan still in play.

Yet, Mr. Sharma told The Hindu, “We’ve not issued any fresh notification relating to the update. The Congress government’s stand against the CAA and the NPR remains unchanged.”

On February 5, the State Cabinet passed a resolution exhorting the Centre to abrogate the contentious law, and begin the NPR update only after withdrawing the plan to seek new information, in a bid to quell apprehensions.

Resolution against NPR

Earlier on January 11, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) had demanded the law be withdrawn, and the “process of NPR be stopped forthwith”, a resolution later adopted by Assemblies of Congress-led Rajasthan, Punjab and Puducherry.

Madhya Pradesh Congress media chief Shobha Oza said, “We stand by the Cabinet’s decision, and further steps will be taken based on it. We have apprised Chief Minister Kamal Nath of the earlier notification.” Meanwhile, officials of the Home Department refused to comment, stating it was a political matter.

Namit Yadav, Deputy Director, State Directorate of Census Operations, confirmed the dates for the houselisting exercise, along which the NPR update would be undertaken, were finalised after consultation with the State Home Department, which deploys staff for it.

As for the proposed new questions relating to the NPR, he said, “So far, we’ve not received any direction relating to any new set of questions to be asked during the update.”

According to the notification, in pursuance of sub-rule (4) of Rule 3 of the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, the State government declared that “the field work for updation of the Population Register and for house-to-house enumeration for collection of information relating to all persons who are usually residing within the jurisdiction of Local Registrar shall be undertaken from 1st May 2020 to 14th June 2020 in the State of Madhya Pradesh.”

‘Review notification’

“In the light of the Central government’s political agenda to change the plurality of citizenship in India, the State government should review its earlier notification and issue a fresh one saying that they’ll either not implement the NPR or it should be restricted to the earlier questions,” said Madhuri Krishnaswamy, of the Madhya Pradesh Democratic Rights Front, which mobilises the State’s people against the law, the NPR, and the proposed NRC.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/grkpht/article30814630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE13-KAMAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/stand-against-npr-unchanged-mp-govt/article30814631.ece

The budget session of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly started on a stormy note on Thursday with Opposition leaders protesting against the policies of the BJP government, including the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Opposition party MLAs held up placards and raised slogans in the Assembly and interrupted the address of Governor Anandiben Patel. The Opposition leaders, led by the Samajwadi Party and the Congress, then staged sit-ins outside the Assembly, holding placards on the issues of law and order, crimes against women, unemployment, rising prices of cooking gas, diesel and petrol and farmer woes, along with the burning subject of CAA, NRC and NPR.

Cylinders and onions

While the SP leaders displayed gas cylinders outside the Assembly, the Congress workers expressed their protest by holding up packets of potato and onion, as well as sugarcane.

OBC census sought

The SP MLAs also raised the demand for OBC caste census.

Ram Govind Chaudhary, the SP’s leader in the House, said the BJP had brought up the issues of CAA, NRC and NPR to “divert attention” from the questions of livelihood.

The SP was protesting against the “oppression” unleashed by the BJP government on women and other protesters demonstrating “peacefully,” holding national flags, to save the Constitution and democracy, Mr. Chaudhary said.

“We have been put in jail without a proper reason,” they said in the letter accessed by this paper.

While the police have accused them of misleading people on the issue of CAA and the proposed nationwide NRC, friends of those arrested, under the banner of Team Nagrik Satyagraha, accused the police of trying to “shrink and divert the objective” of the yatra.

“In [the] FIR they said our yatra is against CAA and NRC. This is an attempt of police and administration to divert the whole agenda of this journey. Our yatra is against every form of violence and hate which exists in society and to spread [the] idea of Gandhi,” the group said in a statement.

No response

District Magistrate of Ghazipur and superintendent of Ghazipur jail did not respond to phone calls made to inquire about the hunger strike.

The associates of the jailed persons had on Wednesday expressed shock after a local Sub-Divisional Magistrate court issued them notices for bail bonds of ₹2.5 lakh each, and two Gazetted persons per individual as guarantors.

The students, mostly associated with the Banaras Hindu University, along with the journalist and social activists, were leading a foot march from Chauri-Chaura near Gorakhpur to Rajghat in Delhi. On the ninth day of the march, after completing 250 km, the ten persons were arrested in Ghazipur under Sections 107/16/151 of the CrPC and sent to jail on Tuesday, said Team Nagrik Satyagraha, the organisers.

246,2020/02/14,Deoband administration asks residents to remove Tricolour,"SDM admits to issuing oral instructions, locals ask for order in writing

The Deoband administration is making announcements in Muslim colonies advising residents to take down the national flag hoisted on rooftops.

“They want to see stones in the hands of the Muslim youth. When we hoist the national flag, they feel scared,” said a local resident, requesting anonymity.

Many residents in the communally sensitive town, which is seeing a sit-in protest against the Anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act for the last 17 days, haven’t removed the Tricolour after Republic Day.

Sub-Divisional Magistrate Rakesh Kumar admitted that he has asked the municipal corporation to make such announcements. “We don’t want people to remove the national flag but they should follow the flag code, which expects people to respect the flag and hoist it only from sunrise to sunset,” he said.

When reminded that the Supreme Court had said citizens have a fundamental right to fly the national flag on their premises throughout the year provided they don’t undermine the dignity of the Tricolour, Mr. Kumar said it was not a “big” issue and that he had received “oral” complaints from some people that the Tricolour was not being respected.

‘No notices issued’

He further said no notices had been issued and that the announcement was not community specific.

However, locals allege no such announcement is made during the annual Kawad Yatra where the national flag is very casually used by some pilgrims.

This comes even after Union Minister Giriraj Singh described Deoband as a hub of terrorism during a recent visit to Saharanpur.

“I have asked the SDM to give us in writing or file an FIR against us for flying the national flag,” said Mavia Ali, former MLA and Samajwadi Party leader. “We are being told not to raise the national flag at the protest site in Idgah ground. The anti-CAA movement is a nationalist movement and the Tricolour is used in any such movement,” said Mr. Ali. “Deoband played an important role in the freedom movement and we aspire to be wrapped in the national flag on our last journey.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gh3yhw/article30814564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE13-FLAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/deoband-administration-asks-residents-to-remove-tricolour/article30814566.ece
247,2020/02/14,Anannya Chatterjee: In flow with tradition,"One could experience swelling rivers and amphibious frogs in the performance of Bharatanatyam exponent Anannya Chatterjee

Bharatanatyam ‘margam’ repertoire has always been a favourite with dancers as against thematic compositions. For one, the latter requires a whole lot of time-consuming research, creativity and originality. By adhering to the established stage repertoire, one cannot go wrong nor come under a scanner for not being unique. Anannya Chatterjee chose to tread the traditional path within which she tried to incorporate a few exceptional pieces of choreography by her eminent guru Jayalakshmi Eshwar. Titled ‘Nritya Swaroopa’, it were these moments of creativity that stood out and made the evening refreshing.

The Varuna Kouthuvam (a hymn to deity of rain) culled from the Navasandhi Kouthuvam (nine directional deities) was a rare one where attributes of Varuna are eulogised as blessing upon the earth and its creation that owes its life to water. Anannya ably depicted the swelling rivers, the engulfing oceans around the globe and all those water bodies that bring respite to the mankind. The crossing of feet as she danced to portray the flowing waters as a gait was singularly impressive. The squatting and hopping posture to picture the amphibious frog was a piece of innovative artistry.

The Maratha king Serfoji’s composition “Kama Chatura...” was another exclusive piece which the dancer took up to play out the maiden, ascetic Parvati questioning Kamdev (Cupid) who offers to help her unite with lord Shiva.

The composition itself was brilliant in as much as it negates while it attributes the qualities of Shiva to Parvati in lieu of her present situation. It was a difficult expression for a dancer to denote two varying descriptions but to the artiste’s credit it must be said, that she did ample justice to the content of this exclusive piece.

The Balamuralikrishna tillana with its striking pauses and tilting rhythm was beautifully unfolded in matching nritta (footwork) which looked novel within the set framework.

The first half was the sedate Alarippu followed by Jati swaram and Varnam – a run-of-the-mill exercise with nothing exceptional expected from a seasoned dancer. The verse that went along with the Alarippu mnemonics was not easy on the ear. The varnam could have had better teermanam (closures); the eye expression for the line , ‘nee sati dora ne kaana raa..’ should have been one of lauding, love, longing all put together instead of the very staid praise. However, Anannya's sanchari to swara (solfa utterances) was worth a mention.

In the whole show, vocalist Sudha Raghuraman’s expressive tonal quality and singing stood out forcing the viewers’ attention towards the orchestra every now and then. Guru Jayalakshi Eshwar on the nattuvangam, Raghuraman on the flute and Keshavan on the percussion made for an excellent accompaniment. The solo was staged at New Delhi’s India Habitat Centre.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/qvz4o9/article30820579.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Screenshot20200211004410-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/anannya-chatterjee-in-flow-with-tradition/article30820580.ece
248,2020/02/14,Sanskritotsavaha: Reinstating the value of Sanskrit,"‘Sanskritotsavaha’ explored the dramatic richness and imagery in Sanskrit literature through classical dance

Sanskrit, though no longer the language of the masses across major parts of the country, is a medium that holds immense significance with links to our rich past. Several texts in the ancient language are imaginatively structured with unique literary devices, rich in their imagery and dramatic value, that are relevant even today. It takes skill and painstaking research to pick elements from several such historic texts, set it to a talam, reimagine it in the form of succinct dance pieces that could pique the curiosity of a literary enthusiast and a dance connoisseur alike.

Sanskritotsavaha, a celebration of Sanskrit over the previous weekend at Saptaparni, Hyderabad was a brief yet effective culmination of such efforts. With a dance presentation by Anupama Kylash, Ajeissh Menon, Vamsi Madhavi and S Jayachandran, all belonging to various disciplines, the pieces were categorised on the genres that the literary texts focus on – including Natya, Alankara Shastra, Itihasa, Kavya, Nataka, Stotra and Padasahitya.

S Jayachandran’s performance to Pushpanjali Upayojyaanam, an extract from Nandikeshvara’s Bharatarnava, was a dedication to the three supreme deities — Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma. The piece threw light on the various categories of flowers that were offered to the deities and their consorts, highlighting their significance as a floral offering besides their decorative value. Using hand gestures to highlight the floral motifs, bringing alive the feeling of true submission to the almighty, Jayachandran brought forward tenderness to the piece.

Valmiki’s Ramayana was the text in focus in the next piece, where an extract brings to the fore a conversation between Narada and Valmiki, where the former describes all the physical attributes and significant facets that contribute to the magnificence of Rama. Performed by Vamsi Madhavi and Ajeissh Menon, the decision to divide the piece between its word-to-word meaning (in the sloka) and the event in Rama’s life that brings forth a particular quality, added to its appeal. Vamsi Madhavi was easily the more fluid performer among the two with the transparency in her expressions, intricacies in her postures and movements.

However, the next piece by Anupama Kylash, an interpretation of an extract from Kalidasa’s Kumarasambhavam was a true dancer’s light for the sheer drama in the description. Structured like a conversation between Parvati and Shiva, the latter suggests that her deep penance is of little value in comparison with his unflattering appearance sans any embellishments. Parvati takes it upon herself to remind him of the deeper truths beneath his appearance – be it the snake around his neck, the poison that he’s held in it (neck), the animal skin that he uses, the positioning of the Ganga atop his head et al. The metaphorical and physical parallels made for an intriguing presentation, where the abhinaya of the dancer came through.

Vamsi Madhavi yet again stole the show with a piece from Rasamanjari, slipping into the skin of a newly-wedded wife tirelessly waiting for her husband to arrive, while stringing together a garland of pearls. She was at ease in expressing the femininity, the shy-innocence of a bride and the longing for the man of her dreams as the slow-paced composition helped her elaborate the emotions vividly. The other two pieces from Rasamanjari too appeared largely relevant in the modern-day context.

Ajeissh sang and performed in one of the pieces where a wife literally shows the mirror to a husband who is involved in a relationship with another woman. The next presentation too was as interesting (probably highlighting the importance of consent), where the nayaka is surprised by the disinterest of the nayika to his advances, equating her discomfort to that of a person who’s confronted by the various elements of nature during a painstaking journey.

Vamsi Madhavi and Anupama Kylash’s emotion-centric segment focusing on an extract from the Abhijnanashakuntala, had Shakuntala (along with her sakhi Priyamvada), expressing her sorrow at having to part from the grove she grew up amidst.

Bilwamangala’s Sri Krishna Karnamrutam and Srita Kamala Kucha Mandala a rare bhajan-like ashtapadi of Jayadeva put Krishna on the forefront in the final stretch of the performance that ended with a mangalam Vijayagopalathe Mangalam. The crispness in the choreography, the organic quality of a live music setting and bhava-laden singing of the TK sisters (Saroja and Sujatha), ensured the evening was a starting point for many who wished to dwell deeper into Sanskrit literature. Though not a dance purist’s delight, the experiment orchestrated by Anupama Kylash bore a mix of contemporariness and tradition.

249,2020/02/14,Bharatanatyam in the new India,"Dancers Nrithya Pillai and Yashoda Thakore reflect on the process of disenfranchisement of the original practitioners

Since the heady days of the classical arts renaissance associated with India’s independence movement, hardly anyone examined the process by which Sadir, for centuries performed by hereditary dancers in temples, courts and palatial salons, was transformed into modern-day Bharatanatyam. But increasingly, awareness is rising that the popular narrative of a 20th-century revival is riddled with missing links.

Today, it is clear that what some see as the democratisation of Bharatanatyam — and other art forms once exclusively practised by hereditary artists — has been a process of disenfranchisement of the original practitioners. From the early 20th century, thanks to the anti-nautch movement, and later, acts of Parliament abolishing temple dancing, the nattuvanars — male members of the community who traditionally sang, taught, composed and played instruments — turned to teach the daughters of Chennai’s well-heeled. Many of their protégés became star dancers. But the original stars? They disappeared, as stars are wont, when morning came and India kept its tryst with destiny.

Nrithya Pillai, a Bharatanatyam dancer from the Isai Vellalar community of hereditary artists, is steadfast in her view that Brahminical forces appropriated the art of her ancestors. “Yes, I do believe that caste and class alignments were the basis of the beginnings of what is today called the world of Bharatanatyam,” says Nrithya. “The access to Bharatanatyam to today's mostly class and caste privileged dancers was established by the denial of access to this art form to the women of my community. It is only natural that today such alignments determine the selection processes for festivals, performances, and awards.”

Yasoda Thakore

Only a few individuals and organisations have offered her stages and projected her voice, says Nrithya. “One has to acknowledge that academic spaces, particularly outside India have been always aware and conscious of the problematic history of Bharatanatyam, the appropriation involved and the gross injustices instigated on the hereditary practitioners. It is only our insular, Brahminic dance world that has never acknowledged the problematic history in a manner that will make anyone dancing today uncomfortable about this form they practice.”

Recently Nrithya spoke in New Delhi under the aegis of the Foundation for Developed India. Titled “Voicing the Self: Hereditary Identity, Performance, and Politics of Bharatanatyam”, the talk was organised by young Kuchipudi exponent Abhinaya Nagajothy and Deepak Yadav as part of the Dr. Vempati Chinna Satyam Memorial Lecture Series. Several young dancers present found the talk an eye-opener. “I would like to reiterate that I don't believe in the narrative of the history of ‘revival’ of Bharatanatyam that is commonly known,” contends Nrithya, granddaughter of S.K. Rajarathnam Pillai and descended from a long line of eminent dancers and musicians.

“The transition from the courts and temples to the proscenium stage had already happened before the revivalists had taken up this art form. The Kalyani daughters had already danced at the Music Academy gathering. The hereditary community was already involved in making their artform visible and it was never inaccessible to the ones who sought to learn it. I even believe that even until the ’70s and ’80s the nuances of the hereditary community were quite strong in the dance form. The earlier Kalakshetra style — the dancing of Rukmini Devi and Radha Burnier do not look anything like the linear geometry that is proposed to be the Kalakshetra style today.”

The contribution of Rukmini Devi Arundale, founder of Kalakshetra, the first institution to teach Bharatanatyam, and the first Brahmin woman to dance it publicly, is hailed for having given aesthetic direction to modern-day Bharatanatyam and established it unquestionably as a spiritually evolved art. However, the wave she began also had other, negative, effects for the hereditary practitioners.

Kuchipudi exponent Yashoda Thakore, who belongs to the kalavantulu community of the Andhra region, elaborates, “What happened during the reinvention of the art form was, when Rukmini Devi and others began to reinvent it, they took the music from the Carnatic musicians, and the complicated tala system. Now I’ll be a little blatant. The virtuosity of these women could never be replicated on the bodies of girls who were not from the hereditary families. Simply because they were not invested in it 24/7. These ladies were invested in it 24/7 and for generations. The virtuosity is totally different. Especially in the coastal Andhra region, the abhinaya is something nobody can replicate. Even she cannot replicate the abhinaya she has done once. So when this virtuosity could not be transported on the bodies of the upper-class girls, the next best way to gain visibility and acceptance was to make it complicated. [Also] the music was kind of standardised by the Music Academy and other academies that had come up at that time. And the trikaala jatis came in, which were never there. Yes, the pancha nadai were there but not the trikaala jatis to this extent, with such cross rhythmic patterns. This is something they didn’t grow up with. And once it got visibility, these women looked at it and said oh okay, maybe this is quality and to be accepted, and they just retracted, shrank and went away. In this whole process of bringing another tradition and superimposing it on this, you have actually done away with the women of the community. That is the problem. It is not about Brahmins not encouraging hereditary women. They took the repertoire from the women and they applied these techniques which are far removed.”

Yashoda, also an author and researcher, points to other factors. “If you’re asking them to dance for two hours at a stretch — first of all, these women, by the time of the nationalist period, did not have the nutrition or fitness they had when they were in the courts of the Nayak kings. And you give them leaps and jumps and lifting of the legs, and say for this stage, this is what has to be performed, and they would not wear anything but the sari — that is something they could not do. So when they could not, they relinquished their art. This is the appropriation by the upper castes.” Besides, Yashoda enumerates countless compositions and presentation styles no longer performed either due to neglect, lack of expertise or the disapproval of revivalists for their erotic content.

Many in Yashoda’s community want to disconnect from their artistic past. The caste name Suryabalija is preferred to kalavantulu so as not to “reflect anything to do with art,” says Yashoda, citing it as “another case of running away from the facts.”

The clock cannot be turned back. However, Nrithya says, “I want an acknowledgement of the actual history of Bharatanatyam and to spread awareness of continuing appropriations of ‘devadasi dance’. When the caste- and community-based stigma predominantly affects the women from the hereditary community and we cope using different strategies (most refuse to talk about their caste identities despite a hoary past with wonderful artists as their fore-mothers and forefathers; some become very aspirational in their Brahminic behaviour, trying to fit in), the privilege of upper caste-class women to claim to have recreated and reconstructed devadasi forms claiming authenticity and historicity. I would like us all to introspect if really the art form has been ‘democratised’. This art was a livelihood for my ancestors, it always remained one for even the nattuvanars who taught upper caste/class women. Is it a livelihood to today’s practitioners? Where are the dancers from varied lower caste backgrounds who have made it in the world of Bharatanatyam? Is there really meritocracy and equity in all of this?”

Today, as India churns, and the millennial generation across disciplines upturns accepted belief systems that have formed the foundations of the country for seven decades, the dance world as a whole has to search for answers to these questions.

‘Today’s dancer did not disenfranchise the hereditary dancers’

Lakshmi Viswanathan, eminent Bharatanatyam dancer and writer, trained under Guru Kancheepuram Ellappa, on the charge that Bharatanatyam was appropriated by the elite classes

As far as I have understood, very complex situations and social compulsions made dedication of girls to temples and their dancing both in temples and public places illegal by the passing of a bill. This was a direct result of the fall of royal and zamindari patronage that sent impoverished dancers to seek a living beyond their temple traditions. The law to stop dedication of girls to temples was done as a major social reform meant to remove the exploitation of women. The lawmakers, as I have understood the issue, were not thinking deeply at all about the art of dance.

This happened in spite of many arguments over several years put forward by eminent persons in favour of the art, supported by the idea of religious and ritual faith. Practically, none of today’s dancers can be fully aware of those circumstances. Nor can they get first-hand information about the reactions of hereditary dancers and their families at that juncture or soon after the law came into force. We are several generations down the line and I do not think that the rather few known great great-granddaughters of dancers of the 19th century are in a position to present a case for their ancestors.

Such being the situation, present-day dancers who do a bit of studying of the history of our dance can only acknowledge their indebtedness to a heritage upheld for centuries by hereditary dancers and their gurus. Today's dancer did not disenfranchise the hereditary dancers. For that matter neither Rukmini Devi nor E Krishna Iyer disenfranchised them. They in fact breathed life into a dying art and did their best to help the last of the dancers and their families.

If a new generation of young children had not come forward to learn the dance under the nattuvanars with the approval of their visionary parents, there would be no Bharatanatyam today.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/2icvql/article30817597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG1716,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/bharatanatyam-in-the-new-india/article30817598.ece
250,2020/02/14,Warner expects hostile reception,"The opener and Smith to tour S.Africa after ‘Sandpapergate’

Australia opener David Warner is braced for a hostile reception but hopes fans will show “respect” as he and Steve Smith return to South Africa for the first time since the ‘Sandpapergate’ ball-tampering scandal that rocked world cricket.

The last time the pair played in South Africa, almost two years ago, it was sent home in disgrace for attempting to alter the ball with sandpaper during a Cape Town Test. It cost the two 12-month suspensions and for Warner, a lifetime leadership ban.

Forgiven at home

They have since resurrected their careers and are all but forgiven at home, with Warner this week winning a vote by players, officials and media to claim Australian cricket's highest honour, the Allan Border Medal — with Smith placed second.

But both players were constantly booed and jeered during last year's one-day World Cup and Ashes series in England, and they are expected to receive similar treatment in South Africa.

The batsmen are both in the Australian squad for three T20Is and three ODIs beginning February 21. The T20 on February 26 will mark the visitors’ first match at Newlands since the 2018 scandal.

“For me personally, it won't be hard at all,” Warner told Sydney radio station 2GB this week. “I just go there and I've got a job to do and that's to score runs and win games for Australia and put us in a good position.”

But he added that “obviously, it's going to be very hostile”.

Australia will be using the tour to fine-tune preparations for the T20 World Cup on home soil in October — the only major cricket trophy the men’s team has not won.

Equally dangerous batsman and wrist-spinner D'Arcy Short, who has been overlooked for a year, has replaced him in both formats.

Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara will relive his fateful 2009 journey to Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Friday after returning for the first time since the deadly attack which plunged Pakistan into cricket isolation.

Sangakkara is captaining England’s venerable MCC for four games in Lahore, where he was wounded in a militant attack on the Sri Lankan team that left eight people dead in March 2009.

International cricket is only now returning to Pakistan, which hosted Sri Lanka late last year for its first home Test series since the guns-and-rocket attack.

Sangakkara, 42, suffered shrapnel wounds to his shoulder and narrowly escaped a bullet which whistled past his head as the Sri Lankan players lay pinned down on the floor of the team bus.

But Sangakkara, who is also the president of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), said Pakistan was slowly restoring its reputation as a safe destination for visiting teams.

“Security is always a major concern everywhere in the world,” he said after arriving in Lahore on Thursday.

“I think the steps that have been taken in Pakistan over the past few years have instilled a great amount of confidence in the cricketing nations.

“I think slowly and surely that confidence is building up and the more times international sides tour, that message becomes stronger and harder to ignore.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/m1kvem/article30834275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ChennaiCITYBaGK074746C3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sangakkara-returns-to-pakistan-attack-scene/article30824089.ece
252,2020/02/14,A flop show by India batsmen,"All three designated openers come a cropper, Vihari and Pujara the saving grace

Hanuma Vihari’s gutsy hundred and the seasoned Cheteshwar Pujara’s 92 were the bright spots in an otherwise dreadful batting performance by India on the first day of their warm-up game against New Zealand XI here.

All the three designated openers — Mayank Agarwal (1), Prithvi Shaw (0) and Shubman Gill (0) — failed the seam and bounce test, falling cheaply.

With skipper Virat Kohli opting for an intense net session over the warm-up game, India managed only 263 with none apart from Vihari (101 retd. out)) and Pujara able to score even 20 runs on a Seddon Park track that had liberal grass covering.

Worrying factor

What would worry the Indian team management was failure of all the three openers.

Shaw and Gill were undone by the extra bounce while Mayank failed to counter to seam movement.

Ajinkya Rahane (18) was out by the end of the first hour, edging one to the slips, before Vihari and Pujara stemmed the rot and got a 195-run stand.

Once they saw off Kuggeleijn’s first spell and the skiddy Blair Tickner, batting became easy in the second and third session. When the spinners were introduced, Pujara pulled Ish Sodhi over long-leg for a six while Vihari also hit three down the ground off left-arm spinner Ravindra.

India lost the last six wickets for 30 runs but what stuck out like a sore thumb was another shot selection by Rishabh Pant when he tried an ugly hoick off Sodhi’s bowling only to be caught by the man at extra-cover.

The scores:

India — 1st innings: Prithvi Shaw c Ravindra b Kuggeleijn 0, Mayank Agarwal c Cleaver b Kuggeleijn 1, Cheteshwar Pujara c Cleaver b Gibson 92, Shubman Gill c Seifert b Kuggeleijn 0, Ajinkya Rahane c Bruce b Neesham 18, Hanuma Vihari (retd. out) 101, Rishabh Pant c Kuggeleijn b Sodhi 7, Wriddhiman Saha c Cleaver b Gibson 0, R.

254,2020/02/14,Delhi presses for victory,"Rajasthan finishes day three on 128 for two after being asked to follow-on

Rajasthan continued to battle and deny Delhi the joy of finishing its Ranji Trophy campaign with a win after an absorbing day’s play on Friday.

After being asked to follow-on, Rajasthan was 128 for two when stumps were drawn on the penultimate day. It still needs 197 runs to make Delhi bat again.

Earlier, resuming its first innings at 115 for four, Rajasthan folded at 299, with some resolute rearguard action from every batsman on view. Ashok Menaria used all his experience and scored 119. With the last three wickets adding 100 runs, Rajasthan showed it was not going to be easy for the host.

Host out of the race

Elsewhere, Bengal’s victory over Punjab at Patiala ended Delhi’s remote chance of qualifying for the quarterfinals.

The day belonged to Menaria and Mahipal Lomror, who took turns to steady Rajasthan’s tumbling innings.

Skipper Menaria’s second century of the competition and 11th in First Class cricket, reinforced his fine form this season. He was not troubled by the Delhi bowlers as he batted with certain authority during his 189-ball knock, dotted with 14 boundaries and three sixes.

When Rajasthan batted a second time, Lomror kept Delhi at bay with a positive intent. So far, he has hit a six and eight boundaries. Much depends on how he carries on when the action resumes on Saturday.

255,2020/02/14,Vidarbha has Hyderabad on the mat,"After conceding lead, the hosts lose seven wickets in the second innings

Hyderabad was staring at another defeat and possible relegation when it finished the third day at 139 for seven, after conceding a lead of 61 runs to Vidarbha in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group match at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium here on Friday.

Earlier, in reply to the home team’s first innings score of 272, Vidarbha, thanks to captain Faiz Fazal’s impressive knock (151, 258b, 19x4, 3x6) took the vital first innings lead to gain a psychological advantage.

But, once Fazal was dismissed, slashing left-arm pacer C. Milind to be caught at covers, the team was eventually bowled out for 333.

Aniket impresses

For Hyderabad, 19-year-old left-arm spinner Aniket Reddy displayed great temperament on debut to return with a creditable four-wicket haul.

When the second innings began, much was expected from Hyderabad’s seasoned opening pair of captain Tanmay Agarwal and Akshath Reddy. But, they disappointed once again.

Akshath failed to read the late swing to be bowled by pacer Aditya Thakare and Tanmay stepped out and attempted an irresponsible lofted stroke only to lose his stumps to left-arm spinner Aditya Sarwate, who was the pick of the bowlers.

Rush of blood

Young debutant Prateek Reddy also was a culprit of rush of blood. He stepped out to loft off-spinner Akshay Wakhare over mid-on, but the leading edge flew to point.

Rahul Buddhi hit two huge sixes off Sarwate in one over but gave the impression of playing a T20 game. He was out flicking Sarwate straight to short-leg.

Then, Mehdi Hasan joined wicketkeeper-batsman K. Sumanth and the former was defiant even as he played the big shots before being trapped leg-before by Wakhare.

Hyderabad’s hopes now rest on how well the in-form Sumanth farms the strike with the tail on Saturday to give the bowlers something to fight back.

The scores:

Hyderabad — 1st innings: 272.

256,2020/02/14,Aim was to hang in there: Tiwary,"Says it was all about having a positive intent

Perhaps the most pleasing element for Manoj Tiwary was the application he showed in Bengal’s 48-run win over Punjab at the Dhruve Pandove Stadium here.

In both innings, there was a lingering feeling that Bengal would throw the game away: it had as much to do with the pitch as with the indiscipline from the visiting batsmen.

Tiwary’s twin fifties on the other hand were an exercise in self-preservation and gradual accumulation. He didn’t bat through on both occasions but ensured Bengal got out of tight corners.

“I was confident since I had scored runs in the first innings. The aim was to hang in there and not throw my wicket away,” said Tiwary after Bengal sealed its quarterfinal berth.

“Even (Arun) Lal sir had asked us to not play any rash shots. Players either defend or play aggressively on a surface like this. I have trusted my defence for longer periods of time and knew that if I judged the length and flight of the spinners correctly, then it would be difficult to get me out.

“And you of course have to make the most of the loose deliveries, it was all about having a positive intent.”

Early in the match, the major obstacles for Bengal’s batsmen were on display on a spiteful pitch, and while they were there a wicket never seemed far away, a realisation that left Tiwary ‘frustrated’ at times, by his own admission.

“It’s frustrating to see them throw away their wickets, especially after they’ve done all the hard work. See a lot of these guys are still young and will learn from their mistakes.

“I just want them to pick up on these things sooner than later because if you keep making the same errors match after match, then it takes a toll on your game.

“As an experienced campaigner, I try to anchor the innings whenever I’m in the middle. I feel the other batsman doesn’t necessarily have to go looking for a big shot if I’m at the other end because over the years, I’ve learnt to take the calculated risk and keep the scorecard ticking. Personally, a hundred on this wicket would’ve been really special but it is what it is,” he said.

About Bengal’s run in this Ranji Trophy, Tiwary noted, “Things are falling in place for us this season but we are yet to play to our full potential. The points table might say we are in the top 5 (of Elite A and B) but there’s work to be done and everyone in the team is aware of it. At various stages in the Ranji Trophy, we’ve had different players putting their hand up which was good to see. Now that we’ve made it to the quarters, hopefully we will play well and go on to win the title.”​",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/aim-was-to-hang-in-there-tiwary/article30823145.ece
257,2020/02/14,Karnataka saunters to victory,"Chases down the required 149 and ensures a quarterfinal berth

Karnataka finished things off 40 minutes after tea on Friday, completing what was in the end a straightforward victory to seal a spot in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals. Karun Nair scored an unbeaten 71 as Karnataka chased down a target of 149 without fuss, defeating Baroda by eight wickets at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium here. Nair’s men are now likely to meet Jammu and Kashmir in the last eight.

Baroda held a lead of 60 runs going into the third morning, with five wickets in hand. It did not take the home side long to break through, Abhimanyusingh Rajput dragging Ronit More onto his stumps for 52. Bhargav Bhatt was then trapped leg-before by K. Gowtham for 6. Parth Kohli, though, resisted. The right-hander had been bowled off a no-ball, by More, when on 8 and he carried on to make 42. It was not until the second new-ball was taken that Karnataka was able to polish the tail off, Prasidh Krishna finishing with four for 45. Baroda’s resistance had lasted nearly two hours.

Karnataka lost Devdutt Padikkal six overs into the chase. On the stroke of lunch, the left-hander followed a slog-swept six off Bhargav Bhatt with another attempted big hit. He failed to the clear the fielder on the mid-wicket boundary on this occasion, however. It did not come to matter. Nair, who moved up to three because K.V. Siddharth was nursing a cut on the hand, held firm.

Clear ploy

Baroda’s ploy was clear. From the BEML end, the left-arm spinner Bhatt bowled almost non-stop; he operated from over the wicket, landing the ball outside leg-stump, on the rough. Bhatt carried on with this negative line, but Nair stayed patient, happy to offer his front pad. The bowler eventually had to change his approach and come from around the stumps. Nair cut him twice to the point boundary. The battle had been won.

Samarth was dismissed by Bhatt for 25, the opener bowled playing inside the line to one that turned sharply. Nair and Siddharth then added 92 runs in an unbroken stand for the third wicket as Karnataka cruised home.

258,2020/02/14,Bengal surges into quarterfinals,"Shahbaz Ahmed’s 11-wicket match-haul the cornerstone of win over Punjab

Bengal rode on left-arm orthodox Shahbaz Ahmed’s match haul of 11 for 101 to surge to a 48-run win against Punjab and qualify for the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals here on Friday.

The visitors began the day in front by 186 with a wicket in hand. It could add only three more to its overnight score of 199 as Krishan Alang removed Writtick Chatterjee to end with figures of six for 53. Bengal was bowled out for 202, setting Punjab a target of 190.

Bengal’s new-ball bowlers produced the breakthroughs in the morning session. Akash Deep was terrific, bowling at pace and constantly attacking on the off-stump line.

Early breakthrough

He got his reward in the very first over when opener Abhijeet Garg poked at a length ball, away outside off and edged it to the keeper. He then rattled Sharad Lumba’s stumps with one that kept low, before the spinners sparked a mini-collapse and reduced Punjab to 37-5.

Then Anmol Malhotra and debutant Ramandeep Singh made the pitch seem utterly docile, reviving Punjab’s flagging chase.

The Punjab dug-out cheered every well-run two, well-placed singles, even bad shots that deserved no love at all. But the joy was short-lived.

Sharp return catch

Shahbaz ended the 63-run sixth wicket stand between Malhotra and Singh when he trapped the former in front immediately after lunch. He then sent Abhishek Gupta back with a sharp return catch for his 10th wicket of the match. Ramandeep was stranded on 69, as Punjab eventually folded for 141.

Bengal last reached the Ranji Trophy final in the 2006-07 season, where it lost to Mumbai. That was its second consecutive Ranji final, having lost to Uttar Pradesh the previous season. It has been a long and arduous wait since, but Friday afternoon’s win will once again revive its hopes.

260,2020/02/14,"Expect Bumrah and Shami to lift their game in Test series against New Zealand, says Turner","Turner believes Bumrah and Shami’s ability to swing the ball will work to India’s advantage during the Test series.

Former New Zealand skipper Glenn Turner is quite surprised that his country has its “nose ahead” in the ongoing bilateral series against India and the reason, according to him, is the underwhelming performance of the Jasprit Bumrah-led visiting pacers.

However, Turner expects Bumrah and Mohammed Shami to lift their game in the upcoming two-Test series, which begins on February 21.

After winning the five match T20 series 5-0, India lost the ODI series 0-3 failing to defend 347 in one game and nearly 300 (296) in the final match.

“I have no time at all for T20 cricket. It’s a blot on the game. 50-over cricket, you can have a game. Technically, I felt bowling from both sides have been way below than what I had expected at international levels in both formats,” Turner told PTI in an exclusive interview.

Turner believes Bumrah and Shami’s ability to swing the ball will work to India’s advantage during the Test series.

“At the moment, New Zealand have their nose ahead but I have been rather surprised, that has been the case. India have shown in three-match series they have several whats and I am surprised that they have not performed better than they have,” he said.

Turner feels India’s problem in Tests could be the excessive white ball cricket they have played.

“Shami has shown he is a talent and has great stamina. It’s almost in my mind, once Test matches start, theory of how you should bowl under certain circumstances in limited overs cricket tends to be sidelined. That being the case, I would expect the Indian bowling to be better than what we have seen,” opined the former New Zealand skipper.

Bumrah is coming back from an injury and Turner hoped that the spearhead will have the capacity to bowl 25 overs in a red-ball game.

“....he has got natural talent despite being unorthodox in his bowling action. He tends to come off the pitch quicker than you would expect and has accuracy.

“He has had a good warm-up bowling 10 overs in ODIs but then limited overs doesn’t help in building stamina for bowling 25 overs a day,” he explained.

As the discussion turned towards New Zealand cricket, Turner said that Kane Williamson’s “orthodox” approach in leadership and his ability to look at the bigger picture has provided the stability that the team needs.

The 72-year-old, one of the most graceful batsmen of 1970s, feels that Brendon McCullum as a leader wasn’t “international standard” while Stephen Fleming’s tenure saw the players becoming more powerful which had its pros and cons.

“When Kane came along, I saw him as more orthodox in his approach. I have always liked his approach to the game, quite a stable individual and I think he has the ability to look at the bigger picture under pressure,” he said.

About Fleming, who captained New Zealand for a decade, Turner said he did some good things but also had a negative impact.

“...that was the time when player power took over. My only criticism I have of Fleming is that because of him, the likes of Kane were able to get what they wanted which was (at times) good for them rather than being good for the whole. Barring that Fleming was solid in what he did,” felt Turner, who played 41 Tests.

While McCullum’s exciting brand of cricket earned him many fans, Turner found his captaincy a touch over-rated.

“McCullum, to me, was not up to international standards as a captain. I felt his decision-making during the England series (2015) was woefully inadequate. I felt he gave it away although it takes more than one person to spoil it,” said Turner, who is known to be sharp in his views.

While his take on captaincy was clear, Turner didn’t want to get into who is the greatest Black Caps Test batsman.

“It’s a fruitless exercise to try and compare people of different eras as there are different parameters to be looked at.

“For example, South Africa (with bowlers like Mike Proctor, Clive Rice and Garth Le Roux) were not a Test-playing nation when I was playing. Also neither Bangladesh was there nor Zimbabwe,” said Turner, who scored more than 34,000 runs in first-class cricket in 453 games with 103 hundreds.

New Zealand cricketers have been known for being gentlemen on the field but Turner is a bit amused by the image.

“...because the assumption that is being made is that you have to be ugly on the field of play in order to be giving your best. In other words hate for your opponents is considered to be more performance enhancing. I find that to be ridiculous,” he signed off.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/7eg9px/article30819895.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BUMRAH-SHAMI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-test-series/article30819896.ece
261,2020/02/14,"If needed, ready to take up opener’s role, says Hanuma Vihari","The performance of Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw and Shubman Gill raised doubts about their ability to face the likes of Wagner, Boult and Henry.

Hanuma Vihari on Friday said he won’t mind taking up the opener’s role if the team management asks after India’s inexperienced opening options were technically exposed by a second-string New Zealand attack on the opening day of the warm-up game in Hamilton.

Coming in at no.6, Vihari scored a hundred but Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw and Shubman Gill were dismissed early, undone by the extra bounce and seam movement during the match against New Zealand XI.

The trio’s performance raised doubts about its ability to face the likes of Neil Wagner, Trent Boult and Matt Henry.

“As a player, I am prepared to bat anywhere. As of now, I’ve not been informed anything. As I said before as well, if the team requires me to bat wherever, I am ready to bat,” said Vihari, who retired after scoring 101.

The Andhra player has delivered whenever given a chance. Does he feel bad about not getting to play four successive Tests after the series-opener against South Africa at Visakhapatnam last year in October?

“Sometimes you have to understand the team combination as well. You can’t get disheartened by it. I understood when you are playing at home, we play five bowlers. It’s obvious that one batter has to miss out. So I took it in my stride. I don’t want to prove anything to anyone but just follow the process,” Vihari said.

Vihari was surprised by the extra bounce on offer on Friday but is happy to have countered the challenge in the warm-up game which provided him with an opportunity to prepare well.

He added 195 runs with Cheteshwar Pujara (93) after none of the other batsmen crossed the 20-run mark.

“Initially, I thought the extra bounce surprised us. (In) the couple of matches I played against New Zealand A, the pitch didn’t do as much as what it did in the morning today.

“Once we adjusted, me and Puji (Pujara’s nickname), we got our eye in, then we knew we had to bat long and that’s exactly what we did,” Vihari said after the end of day’s play.

If the Seddon Park track is any indicator, New Zealand, with a pace-heavy line-up, will be offering seamer friendly tracks at both Wellington and Christchurch.

“Maybe we will get pitches like these because New Zealand’s strength is their fast bowling. They have a very experienced bowling attack but it’s good that we got some time in the middle and we experienced these conditions.

“They were tough and it’s good to experience tough conditions before the series and we’re happy with the way the day went,” he said.

Vihari’s assessment is pretty similar to what Shubman Gill told reporters on Thursday, that horizontal bat shots (hook and pull) are avoidable on these kind of tracks.

“This wicket had extra bounce, more than what I’ve experienced in New Zealand before. So I took some time to adjust and I knew what shots I had to avoid early on this wicket, maybe horizontal shots, I tried to avoid that,” he explained.

So what was the advice from his senior partner Pujara?

“Pujara told me to leave more balls on this wicket, get my eye in and it will make my job easier. I listened to him and it paid off.”

For the Test series, Neil Wagner’s short ball is something that the top order needs to be cautious of, feels Vihari.

“When the wicket flattens out, they (NZ bowlers) try to experiment with the short balls and I am sure even Neil Wagner will come up with the same ploy. We are prepared for it.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/f353f4/article30819848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HANUMAVIHARI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-test-series/article30819849.ece

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday filed a supplementary chargesheet in a Delhi court naming Hyderabad-based businessman Sana Satish Babu, a close aide of controversial meat exporter Moin Akhtar Qureshi, in a money laundering case.

Special Judge Anuradha Shukla Bharadwaj put up the matter for consideration of the second chargesheet filed in the case for February 15.

The chargesheet, filed through Special Public Prosecutor N.K. Matta, stated that the probe agency has found new evidence of money trail in the case.

Babu was earlier arrested and granted bail by the court in August last year. The ED is probing the purported purchase of shares worth ₹50 lakh of a company linked to Qureshi by Babu.

He was arrested in July last year under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, the ED had said, adding that he was grilled for a few hours and taken into custody as he was “not cooperating” in the probe.

The CBI’s special probe team, under then Special Director Rakesh Asthana, had recommended Babu’s arrest in its own case against Qureshi and others.

However, in October 2018, the Alok Kumar Verma-led agency registered a case of alleged corruption against Mr. Asthana and his subordinates, based on Babu’s complaint. Babu alleged that he had paid a bribe to get relief in the case.

Officials close to Mr. Asthana levelled similar allegations against Mr. Verma. The matter reached the Central Vigilance Commission, which initiated an inquiry into the charges and counter-charges.

Eventually, both Mr. Verma and Mr. Asthana were divested of their powers.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/o4heve/article21466771.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Moin-Quershi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pmla-case-ed-files-chargesheet-naming-moin-qureshis-close-aide-an-accused/article30822294.ece
264,2020/02/14,Ramlila Maidan gears up to host swearing-in ceremony of Arvind Kejriwal for third time,"AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal has extended invitation to the people of Delhi to attend his oath-taking ceremony to “bless their son”.

Preparations are afoot at the historic Ramlila Maidan in New Delhi for the swearing-in ceremony of Arvind Kejriwal as Delhi Chief Minister for the third successive term on Sunday.

The ground, which served as the battleground for the 51-year-old bureaucrat-turned-politician during the Anna Hazare-led India Against Corruption movement, is getting decked up and workers are busy making arrangements.

In a near-repeat performance of 2015, the Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party retained power with a scintillating win in the just-concluded Delhi Assembly polls, dealing a body blow to the main rival BJP and completely decimating the Congress in a keenly-watched battle that took place in the midst of anti-CAA protests.

As AAP bagged 62 out of the 70 seats, leaders cutting across party lines, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi (Congress), Sharad Pawar (NCP), Mamata Banerjee (TMC), Naveen Patnaik (BJD) and MK Stalin (DMK) had congratulated Mr. Kejriwal for the historic victory.

The Delhi government, North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), which owns the Maidan, and Public Works Department are working in tandem to make the venue ready for the occasion.

“We had levelled the ground during the PM’s event that took place recently. So, other ground work needs to be done. We have handed over the charge to the Delhi government and its PWD is making other necessary arrangements,” a senior NDMC official said.

Toilet blocks are already in place in and around the Maidan. Arrangements for other sanitation facilities including mobile toilets, are being done, he said.

Senior AAP leader Gopal Rai will visit the Ramlila Maindan on Saturday to assess the preparations for the event, officials said.

The sprawling ground, where socialist leader Jayaprakash Narayan had addressed a massive gathering during the ‘Total Revolution’ movement in 1970s, has a capacity to hold around 1.25 lakh people.

Sources said, besides seating arrangements, there will be arrangement made for people to stand.

AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday had extended invitation to Delhiites to attend his oath-taking ceremony to “bless their son”.

“Delhiites, your son is going to take oath of Delhi Chief Minister for the third time. You must come to bless your son. Sunday, February 16, 10 a.m., Ramlila Maidan,” Mr. Kejriwal had tweeted in Hindi.

In 2015 too, Mr. Kejriwal’s oath-taking ceremony had taken place at Ramlila Maidan. It was held on February 14, coinciding with the Valentine’s Day.

In 2013, after his party’s first poll victory, the swearing-in ceremony was again held at the same venue.

Over a lakh people had attended the 2013 swearing-in ceremony on December 29.

“The PWD will also start decorating the dais and the venue with potted flowers, the NDMC official added.

The AAP in 2015 had stunned its opponents with a massive win in the Assembly polls, clinching 67 seats in the 70-member Delhi Assembly.

Mr. Kejriwal repeated his triumph in the high-profile New Delhi constituency by handing a crushing defeat to Bharatiya Janata Party’s Sunil Kumar Yadav by a huge margin of 21,697 votes.

265,2020/02/14,People of Delhi wanted to defeat BJP at all costs: Congress leader Rajeev Shukla,"He added that his party would introspect on why it failed to get a single seat in the polls, results of which were announced on February 11.

Senior Congress leader Rajeev Shukla on Friday said the people of Delhi gave a massive mandate to the Aam Aadmi Party as they wanted to defeat the BJP at all costs.

Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP retained power in Delhi winning 62 out of 70 seats in the Assembly, with BJP winning the remaining eight seats and the Congress failing to open its account just like the 2015 edition.

“This time voters wanted to defeat the BJP at all costs in the Delhi Assembly elections. They feared if votes got split, the BJP, which contested on communal issues, would have won. So people unitedly voted for AAP,” Mr. Shukla said.

He added that his party would introspect on why it failed to get a single seat in the polls, results of which were announced on February 11. He also rejected speculation of a “secret alliance” between the Congress and the AAP.

“Why should there be such a secret alliance? We fight elections with full force everywhere. We have defeated the AAP in the Punjab Assembly elections,” Mr. Shukla said.

Queried about Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s statement that some hardline remarks of the BJP leaders may have affected the party in the polls, Mr. Shukla said. “People will believe in Mr. Shah’s statement only when the BJP takes disciplinary action against such leaders who made hate speeches.”

“Statements like ‘goli maro’ and ‘Indo-Pak match’ should not have been made. Our party has distanced itself from such remarks,” Mr. Shah had said at a Times Now programme.

Replying to a question, Mr. Shah had also admitted that the BJP may have suffered in the Delhi polls because of such statements.

Asked about External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar’s statement that a book had claimed Jawaharlal Nehru did not want Sardar Patel in his cabinet, Mr. Shukla said, “We did not expect such a statement from Jaishankar. Historical documents contradict his statement. So it would be appropriate that he apologise for this statement about Nehru.”

He hit out at the BJP claiming the ruling party at the Centre took to attacking Nehru every time it ran out of issues to speak.

Mr. Shukla also cast doubts on the Narendra Modi government’s intention as far as providing quota to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes in jobs and educational institutions was concerned.

268,2020/02/14,Panel formed to assess compensation by builder,"Construction carried out in green area

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has constituted a committee to assess the enhanced compensation to be paid by a builder for carrying out construction in the green area of a Gurugram housing complex.

A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel constituted the panel comprising representatives of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), Central Pollution Control Board and the Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal.

The Bench directed the panel to look into the aspect of whether the revised plan of the area which was enforced, “illegally deprived the applicants of their right to ecological services as per the original plan”.

The panel was also asked to assess the liability of compensation on account of violation of law “prohibiting change of common area to the detriment of environment only to advance private profit”.

Interim compensation

Earlier, the Bench had imposed an interim compensation of over ₹68 lakh on Ambience Developers & Infrastructure Private Limited for carrying out construction in an area meant to be a green space in the Ambience Lagoon Apartments.

The orders came when the tribunal was hearing a plea moved by a group of residents who alleged that the construction of a commercial tower was not a part of the original sanctioned plan.

Petitioners’ contention

“Open areas in the colony are shrinking. Groundwater extraction was excessive. Air quality was getting deteriorated. The builder had undertaken construction on designed open spaces, blocking fresh air and sunlight. The approved zoning plans required maintaining at least 15% of the total area as open space,” the plea had contended.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/38d7p8/article30814999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL14-NGT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/panel-formed-to-assess-compensation-by-builder/article30815000.ece
269,2020/02/14,11K trees to be cut for Jewar airport,"Central nod comes with afforestation clause and green cess

An apex committee of the Union Environment Ministry has cleared the cutting of 11,182 trees for the proposed Jewar airport in Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh. The panel of experts has however directed that this is conditional upon 1,12,820 trees being planted at alternative sites and the paying of an environmental cess worth ₹35 crore by the State’s Directorate of Civil Aviation.

Apart from the 11,182 trees to be cut, 178 trees would be shifted for developing the airport. The afforestation activities would be carried out in Sector 22 D and Sector 29-30 where a green belt is to come up, with 52,000 trees to be planted over 11 hectares in Murshadpur forest block and 15.5 hectares in Gulistanpur forest block. The afforestation would cost ₹2.3 crore and be separate from the green cess.

Village development

The cess would be spent in villages such as Rampur Bangar, Nilaouni, Dungarpur Rilka, Chandpur and Achheja Buzurg. Funds would be spent here on construction of toilets and community water tank as part of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, construction of a health centre, organising health camps, refurbishing existing schools, strengthening the technical training institute at Jewar, solid waste management and improving village roads as well as infrastructure.

A survey by the Wildlife Institute of India had identified six species of mammals and 60 bird species in and around the proposed airport site. These included blackbuck, nilgai, golden jackal, jungle cat, sarus cranes, Egyptian vulture and the Indian peafowl; 99 perennial waterbodies were also recorded across the landscape.

The organisation has prepared a conservation plan for the project.

Expressing displeasure over failure of an official from the Defence Ministry to appear before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the green panel has said that “coercive measures” against the official concerned was necessary.

A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel had earlier summoned the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Defence to appear before the Bench and furnish a report on a plea seeking scientific disposal of waste generated by weapons, hospitals and other establishments of the armed forces.

Unheeded court order

“The order [to be present] was duly conveyed by email but no response has been received nor has the Joint Secretary concerned cared to appear. In view of repeated failures, coercive measures have become necessary against the concerned Joint secretary, including attachment of salary and issuance of warrant,” the Bench observed.

Further, the Bench directed the Ministry of Defence to provide the name of the official concerned to the tribunal within two weeks.

Earlier, the green panel had directed the Ministry to file a status report on the plea after taking into account the relevant facts and status of compliance of environmental norms.

According to the plea filed by Anil Chopra, a retired Air Marshal, some of the establishments under the armed forces lacked the requisite knowledge on ecological issues and solution to the environmental challenges. The plea contended that the waste generated by military weapons, domestic, industrial, biological, hospital and electronic activities needed to be scientifically disposed in the interest of public health and environment.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ngt-calls-for-coercive-steps-against-defence-ministry-official/article30814967.ece

272,2020/02/14,FIR against 106 property owners in Gurugram,"They have allegedly been breaking seals of unauthorised buildings over last 5 yrs

A first information report has been registered against 106 property owners for allegedly breaking the seals to unauthorised buildings over the past five years in Zone-II of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG).

The case has been registered on charges of disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant and house tresspass of the Indian Penal Code on February 11 after a complaint was received from the Executive Engineer of the MCG a week ago. The said properties are spread across Rajendra Park, Roshan Pura, Mianwali Colony, Palam Vihar, Sai Kunj, Ganga Vihar, Ratan Vihar, New Palam Vihar, Sai Kunj and others.

‘No action taken’

RTI activist Ramesh Yadav said that he had made complaints to the Police Commissioner in this regard on October 21 and had sought registration of an FIR against the 106 people with all relevant documents, but no action was taken.

He said then made a complaint with the CM’s Window as well, but to no avail. Mr. Yadav said that the members of RTI Adhikar Manch again called up Police Commissioner on February 6 seeking the registration of the case and informed the officer that they were going to file a case in the district courts in this connection. “When we said that we would move the court over the matter, the police finally swung into action and a case was registered,” said Mr. Yadav.

He said that illegal construction and sale of flats was rampant in Gurugram and the MCG had sealed 106 buildings from 2015-19, initiating action against unauthorised construction. “But the building owners broke the seals and continued to carry out illegal construction. The MCG wrote to the Police Commissioner on February 6, 2019, seeking registration of a case, but no action was initiated. Meanwhile, the unauthorised construction continued in these buildings in connivance with police officers and municipal officials,” alleged Mr. Yadav.

He lamented that an FIR has been registered now, but still no action was initiated against the “corrupt” officials who had turned a blind eye to the illegal construction all these years. Mr. Yadav said he would make an appeal to the Police Commissioner in this connection.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/fir-against-106-property-owners-in-gurugram/article30814945.ece
273,2020/02/14,Use OTP to avert misuse of Aadhaar data: HC,"‘Keep in mind amicus suggestions’

The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed the Centre to “keep in mind” the suggestions like having OTP authentication, instead of using biometrics, given by a court-appointed amicus curiae to prevent misuse of Aadhaar information.

“You [Centre] keep in mind the suggestions given by the amicus,” a Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar said.

The court also directed the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which issues Aadhaar numbers, that in instances of misuse, it should take action in accordance with the law and facts of each case.

With the direction, the Bench disposed of a PIL initiated by the High Court on its own while hearing a criminal case wherein a mobile shop owner had misused Aadhaar details of unwary customers to issue fresh SIM cards for use in fraudulent activities.

The shop owner, during Aadhaar verification of a SIM, used to make the customer give his thumb impression twice by saying it was not properly obtained the first time; the second round of authentication was then used for issuing a fresh connection to some third party, the High Court had noted while initiating the PIL.

Subsequently, the High Court had appointed senior advocate Dayan Krishnan and advocate Rushab Aggarwal as amicus curiae (friends of the court) to assist it in the matter.

The amicus, during the hearing, suggested that UIDAI should consider having OTP authentication instead of using biometrics where “security concerns are more pronounced” and “loopholes are easily accessible”.

They also said that the authority should create awareness among the general public about the possible misuses of Aadhaar. Besides that, they suggested putting in place a “cooling off period” between authentications, “to ensure that if multiple authentications take place in quick succession the UIDAI systems would not respond, and thus effectively blocking loopholes as is highlighted in the instant case”.

The other suggestions proposed were that FIRs in such cases should be forwarded by the investigating agencies to UIDAI so that it has information of these loopholes and can create methods to address them.

‘Ensure prosecution’

The UIDAI should also file a complaint under the Aadhaar Act to ensure prosecution to the fullest extent of the persons who carry out such activities, they said.

The two lawyers also suggested that “incidents of this nature must be given wide publicity through both the UIDAI and the investigating agency as the scope/ nature of the breach cannot be adequately assessed without all parties concerned being put to notice.”

“This would enable the general public to assess whether they were also victims and to take remedial action if necessary,” they said.

The loophole in question was first noticed by a single judge of the High Court while hearing the bail application moved by the shop owner in a cheating case lodged against him.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/use-otp-to-avert-misuse-of-aadhaar-data-hc/article30814940.ece

Earlier during the day, the Supreme Court had refused to entertain the plea and told the petitioner, a lawyer, to move the HC instead.

Advocate M.L. Sharma, in his petition, has sought preservation of all video recordings and CCTV footage of the college campus. It has also sought arrest of the people behind the “planned criminal conspiracy”.

Ten people were arrested by the Delhi police on Wednesday in connection with the incident.

277,2020/02/14,CRPF refuses to share 2019 Pulwama attack inquiry report,"Force says it is outside the Right to Information ambit

The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Director General has refused to reply to an RTI query seeking the photocopy of the inquiry report into the Pulwama terror attack on February 14 last year in which around 40 paramilitary personnel were killed and details of alleged connivance, if any, of the officials, saying that the force could only provide information regarding the violation of the human rights and the corruption cases.

Panipat-based RTI activist P.P. Kapoor, had in two separate RTI applications dated January 9 and 10, sought the photocopy of the inquiry report into the attack, the details of the CRPF officials found guilty of dereliction of duty or anomalies and the ranks and names of those punished. Besides the ranks and the names of the CRPF personnel killed in the attack, Mr. Kapoor also demanded to know the details of the financial assistance and other facilities provided to the families of the deceased. He also asked whether the CRPF officials killed in the attack were accorded the status of “shaheed” (martyr) and, if not, what was the term used for them.

However, the CRPF DG, the Central Public Information Officer, refused to reply to any of the queries citing Para- 24 (1) of Chapter 6 of the Right to Information Act, 2005, which he said exempted the force from providing any information except the matters concerning the human rights violations and corruption.

Mr. Kapoor has now made an appeal to the First Appellate Authority in this case against the denial of information. He has argued that the death of the CRPF personnel amounted to the violation of their human rights and the fact that explosives in large quantities reached Pulwama showed that it involved high-level corruption. Mr. Kapoor demanded that the said information be immediately made public free-of-cost in the larger public interest.

“The attack rocked the conscience of the masses and was an important election issue. It is surprising that the information about the attack is not being made public. Every Indian has the right to know the facts of the case,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/crpf-refuses-to-share-2019-pulwama-attack-inquiry-report/article30814912.ece

279,2020/02/14,10 arrested in Gargi College assault case released on bail,"No CCTV footage to establish that they were involved: police officer

A day after the Delhi police booked 10 people for their alleged role in molestation of students during a cultural festival at Gargi College last week, all of them were released on bail by Saket court on Thursday, said a police officer.

A senior police officer said that the accused were booked under charges of trespassing only because they did not have evidence of these persons involved in molestation.

“We have CCTV footage where the arrested persons were seen barging into the college premises by damaging a gate but they do not have any video or CCTV footage to establish that these persons were also involved in molestation,” the officer added.

He added that around nine students have recorded their statements to police about the incident. The case is under investigation. They are approaching students to provide them any mobile video or any pictures that could lead them to the accused persons.

Two more identified

On Thursday, the police identified two more persons in connection with the alleged molestation of students at Gargi College.

The accused are students of various colleges in Delhi-NCR areas. They had gathered outside the college, vandalised a car and then broke in. They jumped over the barricades, outnumbered the college security staff and then misbehaved with the students.

The police suspected that the two identified persons, who seemed to be in the same age group, could also be from the colleges in Delhi and NCR areas, they said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/10-arrested-in-gargi-college-assault-case-released-on-bail/article30814894.ece
280,2020/02/14,BJP’s performance suffered due to statements: Shah,"Home Minister accepts defeat, but defends party’s stand on Shaheen Bagh protests

The BJP’s performance in the Delhi Assembly elections may have suffered due to certain statements, said Union Home Minister Amit Shah at an event organised by a news channel on Thursday.

“Certain slogans should not have been raised. It is possible that our performance may have suffered because of this,” he told Times Now. Talking about Shaheen Bagh protests, he said: “We stick to our stand on the Shaheen Bagh protests. These are not democratic protests...if those protesting have the democratic right to say what they are, so do we.”

Mr. Shah said the BJP“accepted its defeat with humility”. Arguing that the party viewed elections as an opportunity to “widen its ideological base”, the BJP did not contest elections “solely to win” them.

“For some parties, elections may be an opportunity to form government or replace an incumbent government but for the BJP, which is an ideology-based party, victory or loss certainly have their respective meanings but these are not the reasons for which the BJP contests elections,” he said.

To do next

“Since I entered national politics, I have hit the ground and contested them with all I have...this is not the first time we have lost an election...or...results have been the opposite of what was expected...I accept this defeat with all humility and we will ensure that we sit in opposition responsibly and ensure that the government functions properly,” he added.

Elections were a combination of “several factors including ideology”, Mr. Shah said, adding that the results of the Delhi Assembly polls did not mean that the BJP’s “ideology had been rejected”.

“It would be erroneous to say that the election results seek to coney that the BJP’s ideology has been rejected...by that logic [AAP national convener] Kejriwal came third in the Lok Sabha elections — does that mean the people had rejected him? And if that was the case what explains the Delhi results?” he asked.

“...since the party was formed in 1950, we sat in opposition till 1977 but never abandoned the party’s ideology...we demanded that Article 370 be removed then and we believe the same now,” Mr. Shah added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjps-performance-suffered-due-to-statements-shah/article30814893.ece
281,2020/02/14,Bookie sent to 12-day custody in 2000 match-fixing case,"Sanjeev Chawla has been extradited to India after 20 years

Delhi’s Patiala House Courts on Thursday sent Sanjeev Chawla, who was allegedly involved in cricket match-fixing, to 12-day police custody.

Ram Gopal Naik, DCP (Crime Branch), said that Mr. Chawla has been extradited to India after 20 years. He was wanted in an infamous match-fixing case of 2000.

“Mr. Chawla has joined the investigation for the first time. There are many questions in the investigation that need to be answered by him. He will be taken to the locations — basically five stars hotels in India — where he held a meeting with his gang members to fix a match,” said Mr. Naik.

A police officer said that they may ask former Indian players and BCCI officials to join the investigation, if needed. Mr. Chawla’s extradition will help them identify more people involved in the match-fixing ring.

In 1999, Anti-Extortion Cell of the Crime Branch was investigating an extortion case. During investigation, it was revealed that some people were planning to fix the India-South Africa cricket test series to be played during February- March, 2000, in connivance with the Captain of the South Africa cricket team, Hansie Cronje. A case was registered and an investigation taken up by the Crime Branch.

Accused Rajesh Kalra, Krishan Kumar and Sunil Dara were arrested. Accused Mr. Chawla, Manmohan Khattar and Hansie Cronje were also actively involved in the case, but they left India. Mr. Chawla had been absconding and hiding in the UK since then. Mr. Khattar had left for the USA. Hansie Cronje expired in June 2002.

282,2020/02/14,CAA is a result of the Assam fiasco: Chidambaram,"Former Finance Minister says a ‘broad humane law on refugees’ required

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act is a “direct result of the Assam fiasco”, said former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Thursday while addressing a group of students at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

“Today we have a triple assault on India’s sense of citizenship. That is why we say that all three must be opposed,” he said.

Elucidating on how the CAA, National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) are interlinked, in contrary to what the BJP government had said, Mr. Chidambaram said the CAA was brought about after over 19 lakh people were excluded in the NRC, which took place in Assam.

“The initial identification exercise showed some 40 lakh people. Then after a review, it showed 19 lakh people which is also a humungous number. What made it difficult for them is that broadly 12 lakh were Hindus and 7 lakh Muslims. So what does the poor Hindutva-driven government do? Therefore they thought about the CAA. The only way to get out of the Assam fiasco was to make a law by which the Hindus will be allowed to stay and Muslims allowed or forced to go,” he said.

While asking as to where the people excluded “were supposed to go”, Mr. Chidambaram said instead a “broad humane law on refugees” was required. Stating that the BJP was “distorting” the Opposition’s reservations against the CAA, the Rajya Sabha MP said: “We are not against those being included. We are opposed to the exclusion of equally placed categories. These are all people who are being persecuted so include all of them. We are arguing for a larger law.” “Do we have only three neighbours? What about Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal? When you only choose three you deliberately exclude the rest. Why should it be based on ‘religious’ persecution only when there are linguistic, political and racial persecutions as well? What about the other people who are treated worse than the minorities?” he asked.

Stating that opposition to CAA gave rise to the NPR, he said: “They say it’s a benign idea to count people. But the census is there. But you will see the mischief when you see the draft questions. It asks where your parents were born. Why do you want to know that? The idea is to somehow take you back and somehow connect you to Bangladesh or Pakistan. Many people don’t even have documents. In a country with status deprivation, poverty, natural calamities and internal movement how can you ask for evidence about where his parents or grandparents were born?”

On detention centres

Questioning the construction of detention centres, Mr. Chidambaram said, “Detention centres are an outrage against decency and humanity.” While stating that the Congress party refrained from going to Shaheen Bagh to “avoid falling into the BJP’s trap” of politicizing the protest, he said, “From Shaheen Bagh to Park Circus in Kolkata to a village in TN and millions who gathered in Hyderabad, we are confident that we can defeat the NPR politically and CAA legally.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/inxbhn/article30814879.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE13PCHIDAMBARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/caa-is-a-result-of-the-assam-fiasco-chidambaram/article30814880.ece
283,2020/02/14,Relative arrested for killing five of family in Bhajanpura,"Police say the accused committed the murders over a monetary dispute

A day after five members of a family, including three children, were found murdered at their house in north-east Delhi’s Bhajanpura, the Delhi police on Thursday arrested a relative for allegedly committing the murders over a “monetary dispute”.

On Wednesday, decomposed bodies of e-rickshaw driver Shambhu Chaudhary (43), his wife Sunita (37) and their children Shivam (17), Sachin (14) and Komal (12) were found at their rented house in Bhajanpura.

Joint CP (Eastern Range) Alok Kumar said that the accused has been identified as Prabhu Nath (26), who is a relative of the family and lives in the same area.

According to the police, they inquired about the three children in their schools and it was revealed that they had been absent since February 3. The call details of Shambhu were analysed and it was found that his mobile phone was active till February 3 evening.

The CCTV footage of the day were checked and in one of the cameras, the accused was caught entering the house of the deceased around 3.30 p.m., the police said. Thereafter, he was apprehended and during interrogation, he confessed to have committed the crime.

Victim lent money

“Nath said he works at a coaching institute in Laxmi Nagar and also works as an agent for some money lender. He had borrowed ₹30,000 from Shambhu and had lent out the same in the market for earn some interest on the amount,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (North East) Ved Prakash Surya said.

On the day of the incident, Nath had called Shambhu at 3.36 p.m. and asked him to come to Laxmi Nagar. When Shambhu went to Laxmi Nagar, the accused went to his house where Sunita was alone. An altercation ensued between the two over returning the money, Mr. Surya said.

Furious, the accused throttled Sunita and hit her on the head with an iron rod. Thereafter, when Komal returned home from tuition, the accused killed her in the same manner. Nath killed Shivam and Sachin in the evening after they returned from school, the DCP added.

He committed the four murders in four hours, the police said. Nath then locked the house from outside and went to meet Shambhu. Both of them consumed liquor somewhere in Bhajanpura and later returned to Shambhu’s house where Nath attacked him on his head with the same iron rod, Mr. Surya said.

Nath then left the house after locking it from outside. The key of the house has been recovered from his possession, the police said, adding that the investigation is still on and they are yet to recover the weapon of offence.

A police officer said that during investigation, it was revealed that the accused used to visit Shambhu’s house in his absence. He was staying in the same area even after committing the crime, the officer added.

The five bodies were found in a locked house in gali number 10 in Bhajanpura on Wednesday after the police were informed by neighbours about a “foul smell” emanating from the house.

“The police reached the spot and broke open the door of the house and found the five bodies in badly decomposed state,” Mr. Surya said.

The bodies were shifted to GTB Hospital and a case under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC was registered at Bhajanpura police station. The bodies were putrefied and it seemed that the murder had been committed around a week ago, the DCP said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/yhbki0/article30814868.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE14BHAJANPURA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/relative-arrested-for-killing-five-of-family-in-bhajanpura/article30814869.ece
284,2020/02/14,Harassment incident dampens festive mood at DU colleges,"Women colleges work to strengthen security system

Miranda House will possibly have a closed fest this time, Maitreyi College Union has requested for additional security from their administration and Lady Sri Ram College has allegedly deferred their annual fest altogether.

The Delhi University fest season catapulted into limelight when women students complained of mass harassment at Gargi College last week, following which colleges have been working double time to ensure safety of their students.

Aparijita Saha, president of Mathematics department at Miranda House spoke about how each of the 400 participants for their fest were sent confirmation mails and that the organising committee decided to stop spot registrations.

Document scanners

They have set up document scanners for keeping a track of ID cards at the gates, and decided time-bound passes would only be issued half an hour before events.

Safety concerns that were brought to the fore after the Gargi College incident have been felt for a while.

Women students from these colleges spoke about how they usually avoided evening fests altogether unless they were surrounded by friends. A western music society member from LSR who has been performing in different fests said that girls chose to carry pepper sprays for the evening events.

She said: “While LSR does not allow entry into campus with any beverages and without a valid pass, colleges like Gargi which has a few regulations have begun the pass system only recently. Overall, while the participants are mostly safe throughout the day, sometimes there are harassment issues during special performances.”

A union member from Maitreyi College, Shivangi Singh, said that while they were getting active support from their administration for additional security, women students in DU have always faced such incidents, but people never spoke up. What happened at Gargi College has pushed colleges to strengthen their security system for their fests.

Former LSR students recalled how in 2016 when Kenny Sebastian had come for a performance, the crowd had become unruly and the administration had to intervene. Since then, fests have been more strictly regulated.

Deferment decision

The current cultural secretary of LSR, Ishaan said: “Students wanted to use art as a form of protest, but since any kind of opinion brings counter opinions and we really did not want the security issues to come up, we took a call to defer our annual cultural fest ‘Tarang’ before the Gargi incident happened. The incident has only strengthened our resolve to not hold the fest and organise separate society events instead.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/harassment-incident-dampens-festive-mood-at-du-colleges/article30814860.ece
285,2020/02/14,AAP invites ‘Chhota Kejriwal’ to Sunday’s swearing-in function,"The one-year-old was unable to meet AAP chief on Tuesday

The Aam Aadmi Party on Thursday invited one-year-old Avyaan Tomar, who had dressed up as party national convener Arvind Kejriwal, on the result day of the Delhi Assembly election, to the oath-taking ceremony on Sunday.

The Hindu had reported that Avyaan and his family left the party headquarters on Tuesday after failing to meet Mr. Kejriwal after hours of waiting. Avyaan was dubbed as “baby muffler man”, “chhota Kejriwal” and “baby Kejriwal” after photos of him sporting a black muffler, an AAP topi, a moustache and a pair of spectacles went viral.

“Big Announcement: Baby Mufflerman is invited to the swearing in ceremony of @ArvindKejriwal on 16th Feb. Suit up Junior! [sic]” AAP tweeted along with a photo of Avyaan. Interestingly, the Tomars had dressed up their elder daughter as “little Kejriwal” when Mr. Kejriwal won the election in 2015.

Message on social media

“Today, they messaged my wife in social media whether we will be able to come for the event. Once we confirmed, they made the invitation public. We would have gone even without the invitation,” Avyaan’s father Rahul Tomar said.

When asked about the idea behind dressing up his children as Mr. Kejriwal, Mr. Tomar had said, “When they understand that their parents have a role model, then they will also be interested in it from an early age.”

On Tuesday, the Tomars left their house in Mayur Vihar around 5 a.m. for the Chief Minister’s residence in Civil Lines. From there, they reached the party headquarters at ITO at 10 a.m. and stayed till around 5 p.m. Avyaan was the centre of attraction at the headquarters, with many queuing up to click selfies. However, by 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Avyaan got tired and started crying. “The guards had told us that ‘Sir [CM] wants to meet him’ and we were waiting for it. My son is very tired now,” his mother had said. By 4.50 p.m., after failed attempts to meet Mr. Kejriwal, the family left the party office.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/f0l1zu/article30814857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE13CM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-invites-chhota-kejriwal-to-sundays-swearing-in-function/article30814858.ece
286,2020/02/14,"‘No CMs, leaders from other States in Kejriwal’s oath-taking ceremony’","AAP will invite President, PM and the political parties in Capital, says Gopal Rai

The Aam Aadmi Party will not invite Chief Ministers or political leaders from other States for the oath-taking ceremony of party national convener Arvind Kejriwal along with his Cabinet on Sunday, said senior AAP leader Gopal Rai on Thursday.

However, AAP will send invitations to political parties in Delhi. “Invitations will also be sent to the Prime Minister and President as it is the official process,” Mr. Rai told The Hindu. He said the huge mandate was given by the people of Delhi and the idea is to give importance to them. Mr. Rai said the party had done the same in 2015. The party had swept the Delhi Assembly election by winning 62 out of the 70 seats. Party sources on Wednesday had said they will repeat the seven-member Cabinet. On Thursday, Mr. Kejriwal also held a review meeting on the eight seats the party lost and senior leaders and candidates of these seats were also present in the meeting. “During this, Mr. Kejriwal instructed all the leaders to keep in touch with the public in the seats where the party has lost. Their work and problems should also be resolved promptly. A closer relationship with the public should be established,” an official statement said.

Mr. Kejriwal also urged party leaders to be in touch with people who are benefiting from different government schemes and also talk to them about work done by AAP. A party insider said they will do a micro-level review of each booth to understand the results better. “We will look at booth-level data to understand which are our strong areas and in which areas we are lacking. This will help us to prepare better for the municipal election,” the insider said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/z8fr8e/article30814847.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE13LEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/no-cms-leaders-from-other-states-in-kejriwals-oath-taking-ceremony/article30814848.ece
287,2020/02/14,"Protesters unveil song for Modi, invite him to Shaheen Bagh","Demonstrators to pay respects to families of Pulwama attack martyrs today

Inviting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come to Shaheen Bagh and speak to the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters, a song “Tum Kab Aaoge” was launched at the protest site on the eve of Valentine’s Day.

“We are not going to celebrate Valentine’s Day. This is just an invitation to the PM to come here on some excuse, if not other... To talk of love if nothing else,” a speaker announced to the crowd.

While the song was meant to be released on Friday, it was advanced to Thursday since February 14 also marks one year of Pulwama attack. Protesters, on Friday, will pay respects to the families of soldiers who were killed in the attack.

On Thursday, there were back-to-back performances. A rock band played a song with the chorus of “Modi Tum Kab Aaoge”, which was joined in by many in the audience. The song paid tribute to the protests against the CAA and the NRC as well.

“Everyone has been sitting here for nearly two months now,” said Karishma, an organiser speaking to the crowd. “The sound of this protest has reverberated not just in the city but in the entire country. People across the world are talking about it. Media has come. Elections have come and gone. But the person we want to come has not come here,” she said. She prompted the crowd to answer “Should he come or should he not come to Shaheen Bagh?” To this, scores of protesters present there cheered in the affirmative.

Gift for Modi

Following the performance, some old women who have been part of the protest unveiled a “gift” for the Prime Minister, a giant red stuffed teddy bear. Organisers said they would install the stuffed toy here for the Prime Minister to come and collect when he arrives to talk to the protesters.

Earlier, the protesters had also organised a “Postcard to the PM” exercise wherein hundreds of people wrote postcards to Mr. Modi, highlighting their opposition to the CAA and inviting him to come to Shaheen Bagh.

Almost two months since protesters here started their demonstration, occupying a national highway and cutting off the road to traffic, a senior government official or leader is yet to meet them despite this being a demand they have been making since demonstrations started.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/7b7vqt/article30814821.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13DELPRIYASHAHEENBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/protesters-unveil-song-for-modi-invite-him-to-shaheen-bagh/article30814822.ece
288,2020/02/14,No immediate relief to suspended IPS officer in CAT,"Petition to be heard again on February 24

The Central Administrative Tribunal-Hyderabad on Friday directed Andhra Pradesh government to file counter affidavit in the petition filed by senior IPS officer A.B. Venkateswara Rao who challenged his suspension.

Hearing the petition filed by Mr. Rao, CAT member B.V. Sudhakar declined to stay the suspension order. Issues like whether a single member of the CAT would hear the petition -- to issue stay order on the suspension -- would be decided on February 24, the CAT said.

Senior counsel G. Vidyasagar, appearing for the suspended police officer, contended that the State government has no power to directly suspend an All India Service officer under service rule no. 3. He told the tribunal that the State government targeted the police officer. From May 31, 2019, the government did not release even his salary, he said.

Suddenly issuing the suspension order without initiating any preliminary inquiry and accusing him of role in procurement of security equipments suggests that the government acted in a bias manner, the senior lawyer argued.

Stating that there is a procedure to initiate action against All India Service officers, the lawyer said the State government is required to send a report on the allegations against an officer to the Centre.

Only if the Central government is satisfied with the evidence over the allegations, a disciplinary action can be initiated, he contended. The action taken against Mr. Rao contravened the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court in 1972, he said.

Former Advocate General and senior counsel D. Prakash Reddy, appearing for AP government, said the State government has power to initiate disciplinary action against officer as per a recent verdict of the apex court.

He contended that stay cannot be granted in the case. When the CAT member sought to know if the Centre has been consulted before suspending the officer, the lawyer said all the details will be presented in the counter affidavit.

Referring to Mr. Rao’s submission in the petition that he had signed the files relating to procurement of equipment as part of administrative work, the lawyer told the tribunal that the suspended police officer was not a small employee to casually clear files.

Only after ascertaining facts in preliminary inquiries, the suspension order was issued, he said.

The petition would be heard again on February 24.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bomg50/article30827383.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15VJPG4-RAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/no-immediate-relief-to-suspended-ips-officer-in-cat/article30827384.ece
289,2020/02/14,Two modern garbage transfer stations to be set up in Hyderabad on pilot basis,"‘Hook and lift’ system to be adopted at these stations

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) is taking up a pilot project to experiment with modern equipment at two garbage stations in the city.

While the locations are yet to be identified, they will be chosen from the spots identified for mini transfer stations soon to be set up across the city, Commissioner D. S. Lokesh Kumar said during an interaction with media here on Friday.

Modern vehicles and containers would be used to shift garbage from these transfer stations to the Jawahar Nagar landfill, so that the trash was properly covered, and no stench escaped from the vehicle or the container.

“A ‘hook and lift’ system will be adopted to shift the garbage from these stations, whereby the trash containers could be lifted by a hook into the vehicle and taken away,” Mr. Lokesh Kumar said.

In the existing system, the garbage arriving from surrounding localities is dumped openly in the transfer station, and shovelled into the transport trucks, after which it is covered by a plastic sheet before being shifted to the dump yard.

Stench and parts of the trash escaping from the trucks are often cause for discomfort of vehicle riders and also residents of the localities the vehicles pass through.

Containers with a capacity of 12 to 14 metric tonnes would be placed at each of the two new transfer stations, Mr. Lokesh Kumar said.

The vehicles and containers would be procured by the HIMSW, the concessionaire firm for solid waste Management in the city, while the transfer stations would be managed by GHMC, he said.

Meanwhile, GHMC has identified 100 to 150 locations which are suitable for setting up mini garbage transfer stations. A total of 95 transfer stations are to be set up at different locations across the city.

As of now, only 17 garbage transfer stations exist in the city, where the trash from surrounding localities is brought and stored before being shifted to the landfill for processing.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/n0y365/article30824927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY15GARBAGEBINS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/two-modern-garbage-transfer-stations-on-pilot-basis/article30823743.ece

However, Rehman, even after taking money from his brother, had claimed ownership of the house and wanted its possession, which was rejected by family members. He had nursed a grouse against his relatives.

Till now, the Town Planning staff have been using gas cutters to drill a hole into the slabs of illegally raised floors so that the builder would be forced to demolish the remaining slab himself.

However, with pillars intact, builders are laying the slabs afresh even after demolition, sources said.

To discourage this practice, heavy machinery is being brought on lease, to bring down the pillars too along with the slab. In the bargain, damage will occur even to the legally constructed floors, which could deter the errant builders, officials say.

296,2020/02/14,Will Coronavirus scare better visa chances for Indian students in US?,"US may take a stringent view in issuing visas to Chinese students, say students

Corona epidemic in China may ease visa issuance for Indian students this year as the US campuses are likely to give more offer letters to Indian students and the consulates a bit liberal while stamping the all important visa on the passport.

Education consultants and students who have applied for US universities are hopeful that US may take a stringent view in issuing visas to Chinese students fearing the epidemic in China. So this may force US campuses to look for more Indian students and bring pressure for liberal visa stamping.

Moreover, the economy of Chinese families is likely to be severely hit due to the life-taking virus and they might postpone their US education aspirations for next year, feels Narsi Gayam of Promac, who guides students for US education.

It is a well-known fact that foreign students are the key for the economy of all US varsities, and to some extent their very survival. And Chinese and Indian students together account for more than 50% of that intake.

The Open Doors report of 2019 revealed that China remained the largest source of international students for the 10th consecutive year with 3,69,548 students on US campuses and on optional practical training (OPT) programmes. India was at second place with 2,02,014 students as per the report.

Interestingly, some indications of liberal attitude have come from the admission offers from top universities. For example, the Arizona State University, Phoenix and University of Texas, Dallas, have said to have given offer letters to relatively low GRE scores in comparison to last year.

These universities don’t offer admission letters for those scoring less than 315 GRE score. However, a few students received letters even for scores like 305 and 308. “Middle level universities that are likely to be hit with poor admissions due to Chinese factor may offer for far lesser scores,” a consultant said wishing anonymity.

Some universities have also extended application deadlines and some others giving letters to applicants who otherwise would not have stood a chance, he said.

Admissions for Fall season are on and students who have got their admission letters are likely to appear for visas from March to enter the universities in August.

Nishidhar Borra of Atlas Consultants reminds that most US universities depend on Chinese and Indian students for their numbers and he feels one way of handling this disastrous scenario may be being a bit generous in issuing visas to Indian students.

“I don’t say visas will be issued to all and sundry. But consulates may take into developments in China while issuing visas,” he feels. He says this might repeat in Australia as well where Chinese students are dominant among all foreign students.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/nnny5x/article30814204.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-VISA-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/will-coronavirus-scare-better-visa-chances-for-indian-students-in-us/article30814192.ece

298,2020/02/14,‘Farming is one of the most noble professions’,"Governor asks students to continue farming profession

Farming is one of the most respectable and noble professions in the world, Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan said on Thursday.

She wished that students who are pursuing agricultural education encourage their children to continue the farming profession as it promises huge potential in the years to come, particularly with value addition and processing of the produce.

The Governor visited Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) here on Thursday and examined the teaching, research and extension activities of the university. After being welcomed by Vice-Chancellor V. Praveen Rao, Registrar S. Sudheer Kumar and others, she offered floral tributes to Professor Jayashankar.

She interacted with rice scientists and watched a demo on mechanised paddy transplantation, mat nursery, direct seedling method and drum seeder method in paddy cultivation and visited the paddy poly house there. The VC explained about the new rice varieties developed by the university and their popularity among farmers in Telangana and neighbouring states.

Later, she visited the university’s Knowledge Management Center (KMC-Library), walking tunnels at horticulture garden, millet processing and incubation centre and natural dyes processing unit. She went around an exhibition showcasing various research schemes and innovative programmes of the university.

While interacting with students, the Governor said that agriculture was the first profession in the world. She noted that every agricultural graduate should be proud of their education as pursuing it was not only a degree but growing as feeders of the society. She asked students to take challenges whenever they get an opportunity and showcase their abilities.

Earlier, the VC explained to the Governor about the university activities with the help of a video presentation. He stated that the university was striving hard to serve farmers to make agriculture as a profitable vocation.

299,2020/02/14,"Over 3,500 delegates to take part at Apollo Cancer Conclave","Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to inaugurate conference today

Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan would inaugurate the fifth edition of “Apollo Cancer Conclave” and eight edition of “Cancer CI 2020” — an international conference aimed at improving cancer management in the country and abroad at HICC in Madhapur at 7 p.m. on February 14.

Over 3,500 delegates from more than 60 countries are expected to attend the meet till February16, said chairman of the organisation committee and director of Apollo Cancer Institutes P. Vijayanand Reddy at a press conference on Thursday.

Doctors Stefan Glueck, Steven H. Lin (both from US), Sangeeta Kakoti (Japan), S.V.S.S. Prasad, M. Vamshi Krishna, T.P.S. Bhandari, Chinnababu, and Hemant Udayaraju also attended the press meet.

The meet was to encourage multi-modality approach in cancer care by providing a platform to deliberate on cancer management through panel discussions, interactive sessions and debates.

Health Minister Eatala Rajender, Apollo Hospitals chairman Prathap C. Reddy, vice-chairman Preetha Reddy and others will be present at the inaugural session.

Dr. Reddy pointed out that the country has been witnessing about 1.2 to 1.5 million new cancer cases every year and this is expected to double in 20 years, which is “unsettling” more so because as per WHO guidelines, one cancer centre is required for every one million whereas there are just 450 units here.

Both the private sector and the government must work together to set up more than 2,000 cancer centres to strengthen the competences and capacities to manage and combat the disease. Updating care providers with global intelligence and adequate technology was a requisite even though ‘precise personalized treatment’ has significantly improved survival rates.

From 10 a.m. on Friday, every T-shirt bought online from www.1croretees.com will take forward the unique social campaign for the cause of quality education.

The campaign is to retail one crore T-shirts in a span of one year and contribute ₹5 crore towards “Teach for Change Trust” in Hyderabad, which works for quality education for all, particularly children studying in government schools, and for the future of children who are denied education due to poverty.

Launching the campaign on Thursday, actor Lakshmi Manchu, representing “Teach for Change” along with Padma Shri Manjula Anagani, journalist Premamalini and Founder of 1CroreTees Kanti Dutt, said that “Teach for Change” was started eight years ago with a government school in Bowenpally and now was active in over 2,500 schools across India, with the commitment of volunteers, leaders from various walks of life and media. They focused on English language and leadership skills.

“Teach for Change” also created rainwater harvesting facilities in 14 schools this year and reading rooms in schools.

Dr. Manjula said that the T-shirts were reasonably priced at ₹100 each and the “buy to give” would go a long way to support a worthy social cause.

Ms. Premamalini, who produced and anchored ‘Praja Paksham’ programme for a TV channel in the past focusing on facilities in government schools, pledged to promote sale of 10,000 T-shirts through her network for the cause of education.

301,2020/02/14,"A work of art, a piece of history","Crests and insignias collected by Mir Ali Sultan showcase Hyderabad’s story

His hobby is now a piece of history. When Mir Ali Sultan began cutting out crests/insignias/seals from letterheads as a child, he was pursuing a strange hobby.

Of royalty and nobility

Now, sitting in the silken yellow sofa of his second-floor apartment in Banjara Hills, the 81-year-old man flips through scrap books and pages of history. The insignias and crests belong to royalty, nobility and Samsthanams that thrived during the reign of Nizams Mir Mahbub Ali Pasha and Mir Osman Ali Khan.

Invested with elaborate designs and florid craftsmanship, the insignias are a work of art and at the same time reflect the era of gracious communication.

One of them is an invitation by Asman Jah Nawab Bashir Ud Dowlah to Captain Fateh Sultan requesting his company for a fancy dress and dancing ball at the Bashirbagh Palace.

Another is a letter by the Prime Minister Vicar ul Umra to Mir Futteh Sultan Sahib for lunch on a Saturday to witness the langar procession at his city palace.

The Bashirbagh Palace doesn’t exist any more and only the area name survives as a memory.

Parts of the city palace of Vicar ul Umra have been torn down and replaced with tenements and shanties.

The insignias also show the spread of nobility. There is crest with the name Rajia Rajman Rajah Sheoraj Dhanwant Bahadur Assuf Jahi, there is one belonging to Shapoorji Edulji Chenai and one belonging to ‘Thaig Jung Shams-ul-Oomrao, Amir-i-Kubir Khoorsheed Jah’.

Leaping lions, sparkling sun, clashing swords, angels with star and crescent, are all packed in the small embossed ensign of Khoorsheed Jah where a trace of the ensign survives at the Baradari in Shah Gunj area.

Period of 40 years

“I started collecting these when I was a small child and I collected them over a period of 40 years. By 1970, most of these crests and emblems disappeared as the other modes of communication replaced them,” says Mr. Sultan. Hailing from a Jagirdar’s family, he informs that the Sultan Bazaar is named after his grandfather Captain Mir Futteh Sultan. The Sultan Bazaar area has undergone multiple name changes beginning with Residency Bazaar, and later Hasmath Gunj (after the title given to British Resident James Achilles Kirkpatrick).

Some of these insignias still survive in the city at the Paigah Tombs Complex, Falaknuma Palace, Chowmahalla Palace and a few other locations. But in the scrapbook of Mir Ali Sultan, the colourful artistic crests/insignias/seals remain fresh as the day they were printed on paper.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kob4q6/article30814065.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy14mirali,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/a-work-of-art-a-piece-of-history/article30814057.ece
302,2020/02/14,"Teachers have to teach what students want, says educationist","Smart classrooms can never replace a teacher: Anjali Gupta

Private schools should stop promising the moon to parents when they are unable to take off, said educationist and author Anjali Gupta.

“On the one hand, schools should not promise unrealistic deliverables, and on the other hand, parents should not expect much from both, the school and their children,” she said.

‘More career options’

“Don’t expect your little one to get ‘A’ grade in mathematics when he/she is not good in that subject. Unlike the past, there are several career options available now,” Ms. Gupta said, adding that parents were the important people allying them the freedom of choice.

Book launch on Feb. 16

Speaking to The Hindu about her new book “The Cutting Edge”, in which she attempted to demystify the erudite lexicon of policy-makers and age-old curriculum, followed by majority of schools, the author said that dealing with critical adolescent age groups of students gave her that astute and almost intuitive comprehension of the functioning of young adults. The book will be launched on February 16.

Ms. Gupta, who believes in the concept of practical teaching, says teachers have to teach what learners (students) want, but not what they have prepared for that particular class.

“School managements, whose only aim is to make money, don’t give that freedom to teachers in classrooms. As a result, educators don’t explore new models of teaching,” she said, adding that smart classrooms can only enhance the classrooms, but can never replace a teacher,” the author said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/nmlq34/article30814038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy13Anjali-Gupta,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/teachers-have-to-teach-what-students-want-says-educationist/article30814037.ece
303,2020/02/14,PRC working on enhancement of retirement age of employees,"KCR assured staff of raising it to 60 or 61 years

After completing its elaborate exercise on recommendations pertaining to pay hike to different categories of employees, the Pay Revision Commission, the first constituted after the State formation, has reportedly focused on enhancement of retirement age for employees.

The exercise follows another set of additional terms of reference (ToR), including recommendations on enhancement of age of superannuation, given to the commission by the State government. Apart from the additional ToR given in the past, the government is said to have given a fresh set of terms of reference to the commission about 10 days ago.

“In line with the additional terms of reference given to us recently, we are in the process of preparing recommendations relating to superannuation,” a senior official said.

The ToR, however, did not mention whether the age of superannuation would be enhanced to 60 or 61.

The development comes in the light of assurance given by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao that the retirement age of State employees would be increased to 60 or 61 years in line with the election promise of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi.

‘Promotion charts’

The Chief Minister had also directed the officials concerned to prepare promotion charts of employees in all departments as the government is firm that the unhealthy practice of lobbying for promotions should not continue.

The government had earlier asked the commission to recommend changes in business rules to bring about more clarity and expeditiousness in decision-making process as well as modifications that are required in the context of the formation of the new State as well as consequent political and administrative exigencies.

The term of the PRC, constituted in May 2018, had been extended more than twice, and is set to end on February 24. Since there is no clarity on whether the term of the commission would be extended further, the PRC members intensified efforts to submit the report ahead of the expiry of its term.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/prc-working-on-enhancement-of-retirement-age-of-employees/article30814016.ece
304,2020/02/14,"Heavy production aside, prices of rice likely to remain constant","Production of paddy in State is estimated at about one-crore tonnes this year

Unlike many food crops including vegetables and fruits whose market prices depend purely on the demand-supply principle, the production of paddy and prices of rice appear to be bunking that fundamental doctrine at least in Telangana as there’s not much change in the prices of rice irrespective of increasing cultivation in the recent years.

In the current agriculture year (2019-20), the paddy cultivation has been taken up in a record extent of 24.34 lakh hectares (60.85 lakh acres) in the kharif and rabi seasons as the total cultivation of crops has crossed the 60 lakh hectares barrier for the first time – 62.61 lakh ha to be precise till date. Accordingly, the production of paddy is also estimated to cross one-crore tonnes for the first time this year, over 49% increase compared to last year (2018-19) when its production was estimated at over 67 lakh tonnes.

Either poor, middle class or the rich, every section in the society feels the pinch of price rise of such commodities, irrespective of their impact on some sections. Consumers not just in Telangana and across the country are just able to overcome the sky-rocketed prices of onion in the recent months with the prices ruling at ₹25 to ₹35 a kg in retail now. Such upheaval in the price of another perishable commodity, tomato, is a regular feature every year.

“We experienced a similar situation in case of processed redgram (dal) four-five years ago and it has become a regular feature that the prices shoot up whenever a commodity’s production is low and it’s in short supply and the prices drop whenever there’s a glut”, says J. Manohar an IT employee living in Kukatpally. True to his observation, even the wholesale prices of red chilli (dried) went up to as high as ₹22,000 per quintal a couple of months back and as low as ₹5,000 a quintal a few weeks back.

When it comes to rice, the prices are almost constant in the range of ₹30 to ₹40 a kg for different varieties for about a decade now although even the minimum support price of paddy has increased over ₹400 a quintal since 2015-16. “The prices of rice are going to remain the same in Telangana, irrespective of heavy production and increase in the inflation, as the State Government is procurement almost entire paddy that is being produced at MSP and the cost of rice works out that price band after processing”, explains Gampa Nagendra, president of Rice Millers Association.

Even the rice produced in the States as far as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh is reaching Telangana due to unified tax system and the paltry procurement by those State governments at MSP, he argues.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2vl5ox/article30817487.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY13PADDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/despite-good-harvest-price-of-rice-likely-to-remain-unchanged/article30817488.ece
305,2020/02/14,Congress responsible for SC judgment: BJP,"‘Congress treated dalits as vote banks’

The Bharatiya Janata Party has charged that the Congress should be held responsible for the Supreme Court quashing the reservations for SC/ST in promotions as the “judgment was based on the arguments put forth by then Uttarakhand Congress government in 2012.”

Presenting the case before the media on Thursday, party president K. Laxman and others claimed that the Congress government had decided to fill up government posts without providing reservation to SC/STs and this was challenged by dalit associations in the High Court.

The Uttarakhand High Court then directed the State government to provide quota to SC/ST but the Congress government took up the issue to Supreme Court and got the High Court order “reversed”. The apex court had ruled that there was no fundamental right to claim reservation in promotions, he claimed.

Hence, it is not fair to blame the Modi government, argued Mr. Laxman, finding fault with the Congress leadership to hold protest meeting at Dharna Chowk against the judgment.

“The Congress governments had always treated dalits as vote banks, kept them poor and did little for their empowerment without filling up notified vacancies,” he alleged.

The BJP leader alleged that the Congress and others in the Opposition parties are hatching another ‘conspiracy’ after they had failed to get support from people on the issue of CAA, NRC and NPR “to mislead people after levelling baseless allegations on Modi government.”

The Congress never appreciated the contributions of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar or even other leaders like Dr. Jagjivan Ram while paying obeisance to the Gandhi family alone. The Opposition leaders just want to wash away their hands from the quota issue by levelling allegations against the Modi government, holding it responsible for the apex court judgment for the mistakes committed by the Congress, he added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/3t6jwy/article30814158.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14KLAXMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/congress-responsible-for-sc-judgment-bjp/article30814159.ece
306,2020/02/14,In service of the divine,"Pt. Chandra Prakash impressed with a recital of Haveli sangeet and explained its nuances to audience

The India International Centre (IIC) celebrated their annual day with an evening of Haveli sangeet. The invited exponent of Haveli sangeet was Pt. Chandra Prakash from Kishangarh, Rajasthan. His ancestors were associated with the Kishangarh Haveli of Maharaja Shri Krishna Rai, performing raga seva with daily rituals of the temple in ragas depending on the time of the day, season or festival. Pt. Chandra Prakash has been recognised for his musical expertise not just with the Governor of Rajasthan, Maharana Mewar Foundation or Dagar Gharana awards, but has also been felicitated by ‘Anjuman-e- Dargah Sharif’, Ajmer.

Indian music was patronised by temples from ancient times. It is said when some Muslim rulers started destroying temples, the Hindu deities were installed in havelis in Nathdwara, Rajasthan and Gujarat, where temples are still called haveli. Haveli sangeet is a form of Hindustani Music in Dhrupad-Dhamar style, where devotional padas of ‘Krishna-Bhakti’ are sung in Vaishnavite havelis as a musical offering to the presiding deity, along with the nitya seva, the daily rituals. Essentially a tribute to Krishna, Haveli Sangeet is sung along the Ashtayam Seva in the Ashta-Prahar ragas according to the time of the day. There are also seasonal or utsav padas, sung in seasonal ragas and Utsav Padas composed and sung accordingly. Swami Vallabhacharya and his ashta-chhap disciples were the pioneers of this genre of Pushti-Margiya Sangeet.

Carrying forward the tradition, Pt. Chandra Prakash has trained his son Bhupendra (a post-graduate from Jawaharlal Nehru University) and grand-daughter Kritika in Haveli Sangeet, who were there for vocal support. Heeralal Kirtania on harmonium, Pt. Krishna Gopal Sharma on pakhawaj and Pt. Chandra Prakash himself played jaanjh along with his devotion-charged singing. Opening with the Utthapan and ‘Aavani ke Pada’ in ragas Puriya Dhanashri and Gauri, he presented a pada of Maharaja Nagari Das in raga Yaman.

He further presented ‘Rasa ka Pada’, “Aaj Gopal Rasa…” in raga Kedar, written by Hit-Harivansh, a Badhai Pada for Janmashtami in Bageshri, an Utsav Pada for Hindola Utsav “Ho Lal jhuliye..” in raga Khamaj, an Aagamani of Basant Ritu in raga Shuddha Basant followed by a Nagari Das Pada in raga Bahar; concluding with the Ashray Ka Pada, “Bharoso dridh in charanan ke ro…”, by Surdas in raga Bihag. The Haveli sangeet padas were rendered well but the repetition of ragas like Bageshri could be avoided.

Pt Chandra Prakash initiated his audience with the details of Haveli sangeet and kept a constant rapport with them sharing anecdotes related to the padas being rendered. The Nagari Das Pada, for instance, was prefaced with “Nagari Das is a known name in Hindi literature but, in fact, he was Maharaj Sawan Singh, the 8th king of Kishangarh who employed the famous painter Nihal Chandra to paint a portrait of his beloved. This famous painting ‘Bani-Thani’ is compared with Monalisa, painted by Leonardo de Vinci. Later, Maharaja Sawan Singh dispensed with his kingdom and went to live in Brindavan and wrote devotional padas with the pen name Nagari Das. His beloved also wrote devotional padas with the pseudonym ‘Rasik-Bihari’.

Fusion group

Nirali Shah

Maati Baani fusion group was hosted by HCL Concerts at the LTG Auditorium, presenting an amalgamation of Hindustani vocal and folk with Nirali Shah on vocals, Kartik Shah on guitar, Omkar Dhumal on flute and shehnai and Anurag Sawangikar on drums. The added attraction of Mati Bani was the folk artist Noor Mohammad Fakeer on Jidia Pawa.

Opening with a Kabir song in raga Durga, Nirali convinced about her classical training under Sanjeev Abhayankar, with her open “Aakar”, and the sprinkling of sargams which was visible all through, but, unfortunately, this could not help long. The Kafi-based Bandish ki thumri “Mitwa mane na….” next, was disappointing because her long preface introducing this ‘old traditional genre’, hardly matched her rendering. “Tore matware naina…”, describing the beauty of Krishna’s eyes, had Nirali literally whistling in between, perhaps trying to imitate the Flute of Krishna.

There was “Bawariya…” in Darbari, supposedly celebrating the Naad Brahma with dhrupad-style gamakas, “Jago Pyare...”, in Sarang, “Boondan boondan barkha barse” and “Albela Sajan” in Ahir Bhairav, but all in the fusion style of Mati Bani, with the unbearably off key orchestra. Nirali kept trying to establish rapport with the audience and surprisingly the most tuneful response came from the audience when she invited them to repeat the sargam.

Noor Mohammad, with Kachchhi Kafi on his tuneful Jodia Pawa, came as a soothing balm. His ‘Double Flute’ instrument was self-sufficient with one of the two flutes keeping the ‘sur’ and the other playing the lively folk tunes of Rajasthan. He needed just the drum to keep time, which could not do much harm.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/t03021/article30820602.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMGL6160,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/in-service-of-the-divine/article30820604.ece
307,2020/02/14,The various shades of spring,"At the annual festival organised in memory of Sufi Inayat Khan, Ustad Iqbal Ahmed Khan sang the rare Adana Bahar

The annual festival in memory of Sufi Inayat Khan was held at his tomb in Nizamuddin recently. The saint musician was an unusual man. After being a musician in the Baroda and Hyderabad courts, he went to the US, where he found his Sufi teaching had more resonance with his audience than his music. He returned one last time to India to die in Delhi, where his tomb now lies.

On the opening day, Ustad Iqbal Ahmed Khan offered his musical “haazri”; he shared that he had been associated with the festival for over 40 years, and that his music was as much an offering to the late Saint musician as it was to his own ancestors whose graves lie in the “dargah”, nearby. As he said, his “haazri” at this festival was special and he always sang rare compositions that he never sang elsewhere.

Musical legacy

His opening raga Bihagada was his main piece, followed by a bandish in Basant “ma shabad sunaaye koyaleeya” then in Bahar “phool khile bageeyan mein” in a racy Ek taal. But it was the array of versions of Bahar that followed that were truly spectacular. The Ustad shared that Hazrat Amir Khusrau, whose musical legacy he represented, had created raga Bahar as an additional raga to render in spring. Loving the raga a lot, Amir Khusrau had then gone on over the years to combine Bahar with other ragas, and composed pieces with lyrics relevant to spring. The word “Bahar” has a Persian originwhich means spring. The usage of the notes of raga Bahar lend themselves to being combined with other ragas, popular combinations are Basant Bahar and Bhairon Bahar.

Ustad Iqbal Ahmed Khan sang the rare Adana Bahar, “Khwaja Nizam ke ghar aaj” composed by Hazrat Amir Khusrau. The combination of both ragas was masterly. It was hard to discern when the Adana merged into the Bahar. Compositions sung in Suha Bahar and Shahana Bahar (in dhammar taal) were again Khusrau’s. It was laudable that raga Bahar had been combined with fairly similar ragas like Suha, Nayaki Kannada and Adana, yet each “jor” raga had its own distinct identity. Next was a rare “qual” in Bilawal Bahar; also a composition of Amir Khusrau. The Ustad shared that he had also received training in Bageshwari Bahar, Ramkali Bahar, Hindol Bahar and Jaijaiwanti Bahar, amongst others.

Another very rare composition was by Shah Sadarang, in Raga Basant. Unusually, this was said to have been made in honour of Amir Khusrau with the lyrics “lakh baras jeeve mera Khusrau banara, keht Sadarang rangeela”. The concluding piece was a drut teen taal composition in raga Nayaki Bahar, which was attributed to emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, whose pen name was “Shauq Rang”.

The ambience created by the Ustad’s disciples Vivek Prajapati, son Saad Iqbal, nephews Abad Ahmed and Manal Ahmed, singing in unison was another laudable feature of Ustad Iqbal Ahmed’s concert, as he said, “it’s important to give disciples a platform.” On the tabla was Akbar Latif, and on the harmonium, Zakir Dholpuri.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/9haxaq/article30820524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14DFRUSTADIQBALAHMEDKHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-various-shades-of-spring/article30820525.ece
308,2020/02/14,Bantureethi: Tribute in true sense,"Nadaswaram artistes were at the forefront of this Thyagaraja Aaradhana

The Thyagaraja Aaradhana at Shivam is noteworthy for its efforts in giving time and attention to the nadaswaram artistes. Otherewise, they genrally serve to fill in the time as the audience streams in and walks around finding seats.

Titled ‘Bantureethi’, the event began with the mandatory invocation to Ganesha, followed by Unchchavrutthi. Musician Kota Sivakumar donned the role of Thyagaraja. Accompanying Sivakumar was a nadaswaram team who played Thyagaraja kritis like Ramabhakthi Samrajyamu (Bangala ragam), Marugelara O Raghava (Jayanthasri), and other numbers. Later, the nadaswaram team led by A Purushottam took to the stage and rendered the popular Thyagaraja kriti Samajavara gamana (Hindolam) in a detailed way and it was a melodious presentation.

A veena programme by Veluri Lakshmi Geetha saw her present Bantureethi Koluveeyavayya Rama (Hamsanadam) with alapana and swaras. It was a crisp and fairly melodious rendition. This was followed by a fast-paced bhajan Vanamali Vasudeva. She was accompanied by P Durgakumar on mridangam. A group of well-known artistes took to the stage for the goshti gaanam of the Pancharatna kritis — Jagadanandakaraka (Nata), Dudukugala (Gowla), Sadhinchene (Arabhi), Kanakanaruchira (Varali) and Yendaro Mahanubhavulu (Sri). The artistes included Komanduri Seshadri, Seshulatha Viswanath, Y Ramaprabha, Gyanambal, N Ramamurthy, K Varalakshmi, TV Vijayalakshmi, Komanduri Sowrirajan, S Chandrashekhar, SK Charyulu and K Yugandhar. The accompanying artistes were P Durgakumar on mridangam, SV Ramanamurthy on violin and Gurajada Sivaram on flute.

In the middle of the programme Komanduri Seshadri announced that the musicians had to repeat Sadhinchene in the third pancharathna kriti. These announcements have become necessary in Thyagaraja Pancharathna group renditions nowadays given that two schools of thought now prevail, each of which insists that the charanams should end with a repeat of Sadhinchene or Samayaniki respectively.

The Aaradhana ended with the customary Mangalam. Instead of the Pavamana suthudu which is quite common, the audience heard a composition of Walajapet Venkataramana Bhagavathar who was the chief disciple of Thyagaraja, and carried the lineage diligently and was also a composer in his own right. This Walajapet composition euologises his guru Thyagaraja — Kakarla Vamsa Sambhootha (Surati). Seshulatha and Ramaprabha rendered, in unison, the compostion tuned by Nedunuri Krishnamurthy.

The programme was attended by a small but disciplined crowd and it was a delight to see percussionists, violinists and vocalists abound in the audience who enthusiastically participated in the brinda gaanam.

309,2020/02/14,Jamming with Masala Coffee,"An EDM version of ‘Kantha’, new members and an upcoming EP will feature in Indie folk band Masala Coffee’s concert on February 15

If you’ve been to a Masala Coffee show, you know it isn’t over till a deafening encore coaxes the band into performing ‘Kantha’. At their concert on February 15, the Indie band is back with an EDM version of the hit song. Composed by founder Varun Sunil, it was first performed on Kappa TV’s show, Music Mojo, in 2015, and has since garnered over 15 million views on YouTube. “You will also find it in our first album of 2020, to be launched next month, featuring folk rock numbers in English, Hindi, Tamil and Punjabi,” says Sunil.

City of favourites

Back in Chennai for the eighth time, they are clearly fans of the city. “We simply love the people here and their spirit. The way they accept the music is amazing,” says Sunil. The nine-member band — with Daya Sankar on drums, Preeth PS and David Crimson on guitar, Pauly on bass, and Krishna Raj on the violin — will be joined by renowned veena player and composer, Rajesh Vaidhya. “He will perform our originals along with a few AR Rahman hits,” says Sunil, adding that their compositions will also be heard in Dulquer Salmaan’s upcoming Tamil film, Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal and Bougain Villa in Telugu.

And, of course, there is the food. “We enjoy sampling local cuisine. Chennai’s kothu parotta and jigarthanda are my favourites,” says Sunil.

Surprisingly, filter coffee doesn’t make it to the list. But the band, like its name, likes to be different. “When we were brainstorming for ideas, I took a break and went outside the studio to our regular chai waala.” Inspired by the menu, their sound engineer suggested ‘masala chai’. “I thought it was too common and replaced chai with coffee. Back then, even a Google search did not throw up any results for Masala Coffee, and the name just stayed.”

Coming up

There is a lot more brewing for the band apart from the new album. They’ve just launched their EP, Kimaya, named after their guitarist Crimson’s daughter, and added three new members to their lineup. “Aslam and Crishna are the new vocalists, and Steve Kottur joins us on the keyboard,” says Mumbai-based Sunil, explaining that the band wants to cater to a pan-India crowd and is now gearing up to perform at the Goa Carnival 2020 later this month. “We are not a Kerala-based band, but an Indian band. With the new members, we now have eight languages on board, including Arabic. Our folk flavour will always be present in our music,” says Sunil, who recently turned an independent musician after signing a contract with Sony. “I will be working on six music videos and eight lyric videos in the ‘tam pop’ genre.” His work will also feature in the upcoming Tamil film, Poda Mundam, and two Malayalam films: Cheruvadi Phanto, and another for Friday Filmhouse.

310,2020/02/14,How plants create music,"Using specialised technology, MasterPlants Orchestra, from Damanhur, Italy, creates music from plants

At Cubbon Park, plant music technician Tritone Crisantemo shows how using a plant to MIDI interface, called Symphony, a plant’s resistance from a leaf to the root system is transformed into music.

A crowd gathers around while Tritone demonstrates how it works. “The technology we use enables us to listen to the electrical resistance in the plant. If there is a higher resistance, there is a higher note, if there is a lower resistance there is a lower note. The plant can then choose the note within the human musical system. The device amplifies the vibrations already present in the plant, translating the vibrations into the human musical system, which is a subdivision of all the vibrations present around us all the time.”

MasterPlants concert

Tritone adds: “Any plant can play music, though it shouldn’t be too dry or dusty. Since we measure the electrical signals within the plant, plants that have more water in their bodies conduct better and so the plants are able to musically express themselves better.”

Bangaloreans can attend a concert by Masterplants Orchestra, comprising Tritone, multi-instrumentalist Benjamin Andersen and Japanese singer Chiyo Kaiga. Organised by Arun Sivag’s GlobalKulture Organisation, the Bengaluru concerts will be held on February 14 at Taj Vivantha, Yeshwanthpur and on February 16, 10 am onwards at Band Stand in Cubbon Park. MasterPlants Orchestra had earlier performed in a school and at a rather unique venue—Shivajinagar Police Station.

Stage plot

As we are spellbound listening to the sweet music emanating from the plants, Tritone, Benjamin and Chiyo trace the history of plant music and of their band. “We are two entities working from Damanhur, one is the sister company called Music of the Plants that produces these devices and the other is our collective, The Masterplants Orchestra, where we are more on the field, pushing the limits of what can be done with the technology, and figuring how to spread awareness on this in the best way possible.” Tracing the history of plant music, Tritone says: “In the 1970s in Damanhur (a community in Piemonte Italy) a group of researchers began to develop a technology that could bridge the ancient and intrinsic connection that humanity has to plants, nature and life. Inspired by Damanhurian mythology and by Oberto Airaudi, the founder of Damanhur, the team began to create the technology called Music of the Plants. Throughout the years various iterations of plant music technology has been developed. And in the early 2000’s, the brand Music of the Plants was created.” Tritone said MasterPlants Orchestra was started around three years ago within the Damanhur community. “Benjamin started to play with the older devices that could allow one plant to play music. We decided to create better devices that can allow more plants to play music with more complex compositions. In that moment, something lit up in us and everything fell into place.”

Tritone, Benjamin and Chiyo started to create a new device. They faced some difficulties. They met a technician in Denmark, Martin Luckmann, who was the first builder of the Masterplants Symphony device.

Symphony device

“Then half a year later we needed some upgrades and so we currently have a lead engineer from Greece, Spiros Makris. We are now working on developing Symphony 2.0, which is a larger device and a more affordable one, because right now plant music technology is somewhat expensive. Symphony 2.0 will allow the plants to not only control the notes, but we are also studying how the plants to control the settings of the device,” Tritone says

Benjamin, who plays the electric guitar and various percussion instruments in Masterplants, also knows how to play the tabla. “I taught myself the tabla for about two years. When I was presented to a master in Varanasi, I played for maybe 10 seconds and he said stop, stop! you have to start all over!...so I learnt the tabla from him and now I play a mix of what I teach myself and what I have learnt from my master.”

Chiyo says she met Tritone and the spiritual community of Damanhur. “It is a sacred place and since then my life has been changing, spiritually and emotionally. This is my first visit to India. I consider MasterPlants as a door to the next, higher dimension.”

Speaking about some of the challenges they have faced, Benjamin says: “One thing we did when we made the device was that we enabled the plant to play within the musical system of rhythm. The plants have a rhythmic pattern according to how quickly we measure them. So what we did was to translate that into what is being used in music, beats per minute (bpm). In the older devices, that was just in seconds. But this was not reasonable for musicians so we made it more compatible with human music. We have found different ways of incorporating different scales, ragas, and musical options.” This interspecies concert also raises awareness on nature. Tritone adds, “We are bridging the gap between humans and nature.”

311,2020/02/14,Demystifying the magic of theatre,"In the play, Colors of Trans 2.0, when the transgender performer Living Smile Vidya bares her surgically reconfigured body in a moment of aching vulnerability, it induces gasps from onlookers accustomed only to cis experiences. In Jhalkari, when the Rani of Jhansi (Dipika Pandey) comes across her doppelgänger, she instantly drops her regal guard and recognises in a stranger an irresistible kinship. It’s a compelling moment in which barriers of caste and class become immaterial. This, despite the actors looking nothing like each other. In Zarr, Ila Arun encapsulates a woman’s life journey in just an instant, as she sheds her new-found sartorial opulence to reveal the humble trappings of her beginnings. And, in A Walk in the Woods, Rajit Kapur’s jaded diplomat abruptly forgoes his consular stiffness by walking out into the rain in an unguarded moment in which the answer to a diplomatic impasse miraculously appears.

Accessible to all

These are not ‘teachable’ moments that announce an idea through mere exposition, but transfiguring epiphanies, fleeting but powerful, that occur on the stage but alter our view of the real world in unexpected ways. These patterns of staging, that hold in their emotive thrall successive sets of audiences, have been extensively studied by theatre practitioner, Will Weigler, for his dissertation with the University of Victoria in British Colombia. Now a published book, The Alchemy of Astonishment is an exhaustive compilation of innovative techniques that, paired with a set of impeccably designed teaching cards, becomes a tool not just to create theatre redolent with resonant moments, but also develop a vocabulary of staging strategies that demystifies the magic of theatre, and makes it accessible to all. It is an intervention that has its genesis in Weigler’s many years in community-based theatre. “I realised that the more I weighed in, the less agency people had over their own stories, in communities I worked with. I was searching for a way to give them the ‘genius’ to create without the need to be professionally trained,” says Weigler. The spark came in the 1980s, during the time he ran a youth theatre company.

Rooted in social change

Weigler is currently in the midst of an eight-week sojourn in India, conducting workshops of The Alchemy of Astonishment, while working with a professional troupe from the Mumbai-based Five Senses Theatre to mount Even Mists Have Silver Linings, a play that addresses LGBTHQIA+ identity and stigma in India, and seeks to activate audiences to change their attitudes towards these populations. The creative process of the play involves intense psycho-physical training by Victor Thoudam, an original open script contributed by this writer, and staging scenarios devised by the acting ensemble using community-based research along with Weigler’s invaluable Alchemy cards.

At just seven, Weigler would marshall neighbourhood children into creating skits out of Peanuts, the popular comic strip by Charles Schulz. His first professional directing gig at 15 was an opera about a cockroach and an alley cat. He remembers himself as a ‘theory junkie’ always looking to figure out how things worked, and found himself torn between the artistic pursuit of theatre and his social justice persuasions. “Social justice theatre in the 1970s was easy satire that preached to the converted, and it didn’t please me aesthetically,” recalls Weigler. Coming across the French term animateur socioculturel, which connoted a cross between a social worker, community activist and an artist, gave him a name for the space he wanted to occupy. “I was then able to imagine myself doing that, and it opened up possibilities,” he says. His career has combined academia with a theatre practice rooted in social change.

Common ground

The 2013 project From The Heart: Enter into the Journey of Reconciliation is a play Weigler created with over one hundred Canadian people. It was “a culturally diverse, inter-generational group of almost entirely non-indigenous men and women who found common ground creating and performing an unconventional theatre production about [their] personal understanding of the fraught legacy of colonialism in Canada.” The award-winning immersive theatre project also served as a proof of concept for the principles outlined in The Alchemy of Astonishment. “The play was full of these gasp-inducing moments all the way through and they were crafted by the cast,” he explains. His work on his thesis began in the fall of 2006 and took all of five years. “The book was finally ready to take off when I was diagnosed with throat cancer. I got better, after a full range of treatment, and six months of radiation, but it took me out of commission for a year,” says Weigler. Back on his feet, the project in India will mark the first time a full-length play will be created making extensive use of the Alchemy cards.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/b61n3l/article30823164.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WILL-Classroom,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/demystifying-the-magic-of-theatre/article30823165.ece
312,2020/02/14,Grave concern,"Surya Mohan Kulshreshtha’s “Bury the Dead”, staged at the ongoing 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav, makes a potent statement against war-mongers

Recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, Surya Mohan Kulshreshtha’s productions are regularly featured at the annual Bharat Rang Mahotsav (BRM). One of his productions,“Queen and the Rebels”, which dramatised the theme of war, is still remembered by the discerning.

His brilliance as an actor in “Bare Foot in Athens” which was directed by the doyen of Indian theatre, Prof. Raj Bisaria, was very much in evidence. True to his artistic oeuvre, Kulshreshtha recently directed “Bury the Dead” for NIPA Rangmandali, Lucknow”, presented at Shri Ram Centre as a part of the ongoing BRM. It exposes neo-colonial forces which invade other nations to plunder their wealth. In Delhi, this play was staged about three decades ago. Today, after watching a new version of the play, one finds that the play has a striking contemporary relevance.

Written by Irwin Shaw, an American playwright, in 1936, it is adapted by Kulshreshtha in Hindi. The play opens in an unidentified space.

There is a raised platform upstage. Downstage, soldiers are digging a common grave for six dead soldiers whose bodies are kept right downstage wrapped in a piece of cloth. The soldiers engaged in digging the grave are constantly prodded by their supervisor, holding a gun. The time and place are not identified but gives the sense that a bloody war is being fought.

The soldiers digging the grave finally manage to finish their work and start to bring the bodies into the grave. To their horror and shock, the dead soldiers stand up and refuse to lie down. The dead are angry and protest against their unjustified killings to serve the cause of a handful of Generals. When the unusual situation is reported to the high command, it is at first amused and later shouted at the captain for his dereliction of duty. But he insists that the members of high command personally inspect the situation.

Furious at the blatant defiance of the dead, they order that the dead should be shot. Priests are called to perform last rites in the honour of the dead. The dead defy priests with disdain. As the last resort, the high command brings wives, sweethearts and close relatives of the dead soldiers. The conversation between the dead and their dear-ones reveals that the soldiers have come from lower classes who have suffered all their lives to make both ends meet and dreamt to lead a good life. Now their hopes are muffled and have bitter memories of the struggle for survival. A mother is shocked to see the horribly disfigured face of her son. The relatives make appeal to the corpse to lie down in the grave. But among them the stepsister of a dead soldier expresses her solidarity with her brother to stand up and renew struggle for peace and better life on earth. The dead express their anger that they are made cannon fodder in a war fought by war-mongers in control of state apparatus to plunder the wealth of weaker nations.

Imaginatively designed

The production is imaginatively designed which facilitates the flow of action without any interruption with focus on vital dramatic situations.

Director Kulshreshtha has created expressionistic ambience through stylistic lighting design to depict the resurrection of soldiers. This is a situation in which the boundaries between the past and the present, the living and the dead are blurred. He has projected a stunted tree and a huge piece of cloth in red upstage which tend to be a metaphor to suggest that war causes devastation. The use of various poetic pieces by different progressive poets enhances the anti-war message.

The play ends with the following couplet by Sahir Ludhiyanvi: Tank Aage Bade Ke Peechhe Hate, Kokh Dharti Kei Banjh Hoti Hai, Fateh Ka Jasn Ho ke Haar Ka Soug, Zindagi Maiyaton Pe Roti Hai. (Whether tank advances forward or moves backward, the womb of the earth becomes barren, whether it is the celebration of victory or the lamentation about the defeat, life weeps over the dead.) The poem is set to melodious tune that stirs human soul, making fervent appeal for peace.

A well-rehearsed production, “Bury the Dead” is convincingly performed by the large cast.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/gil03r/article30820363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20191005-WA0008,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/grave-concern/article30820366.ece
313,2020/02/14,Sima Mukhopadhyay’s talks about identity crisis,"Director Sima Mukhopadhyay on “Anahuta”, a pulsating thriller that looks beyond the obvious

Having directed several successful plays, including “Boli”, “Shunyapat”, “Maayer Moto”, “Chhayapath”, “Kobi Kahini”, “Bhul Swarga” and “Bombagarh er Raja”, noted Bangla director and playwright Sima Mukhopadhyay is known to experiment and venture beyond her comfort zone.

This was evident when the Kolkata-based group Samstab, staged “Anahuta” (The Uninvited), a psychological thriller written by Snehashish Bhattacharya and directed by her, at the ongoing 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav organised by the National School of Drama, recently. Holding the audience in rapt attention, it drew repeated applause.

This taut thriller sees the contented life of Nirupam Goswami, an ex-Army man turned entrepreneur who lives with his wife Sujata and son Debopam, turn upside down when a stranger intrudes into their house to claim that he is the real Nirupam. With the stranger presenting several proofs, the couple struggle to fight against all odds.

Sima Mukhopadhyay

In an interaction, Mukhopadhyay, talks about the play, it’s subtext, and the challenges she faced directing it.

Edited excerpts:

What attracted you to direct “Anahuta”?

I have known playwright Snehashish Bhattacharya for a long time and have directed his play “Gobhir Asukh”. Besides the story line, what greatly appealed to me was the sub-text which talks about love, victory, defeat, success, etc. I knew only by directing the play, will I be able to know more about the layered narrative. Moreover, I have always tried not to repeat myself in my productions and challenge myself by trying something new and novel. Having never directed a psychological thriller before, I found this play, an apt opportunity to do so.

What does the play intend to convey?

On the face of it, the storyline appears very simple, that of an “uninvited guest”, claiming to be the husband of a woman, who is leading a life with her husband, an ex-army man. On delving deeper, you find that it reflects philosophy of life. It raises and explores some vital questions of life, like what is truth and falsehood, what is legal and illegal, what is victory and defeat, bringing into sharp focus grey areas of life. The story conveys the message that nothing is permanent, neither success nor defeat and that in life, victory or defeat have no value. What we see or perceive is not necessarily true.

It also talks about identity and asks if documents like identity card and papers, truly show who we really are?

Tell us about the challenges you faced while mounting the play

My earlier plays were either socio-political or biographical. This was the first time I was doing a thriller. So that itself was a challenge. The most important challenge was to ensure that the actors effectively played their characters without revealing the truth or the climax. In order to get the actors immersed in the play, we had several readings, discussing each situation and character thread-bare, enabling everyone to understand the story and the personalities.

Repeated rehearsals ensured that hand, body, facial and eye movements became an integral part of acting. We conducted several workshops to help actors to modulate their voice effectively to bring out the finer nuances of the characters.

How did you sustain the tension?

Creating a tempo and sustaining it is primary for a thriller in order to keep the audience engaged and on the edge of the seat. The content itself was good and I edited some portions and made some additions. For example, instead of the scene showing the wife (Sujata) dreaming of her husband (Nirupam) in the original, I brought them face-to-face in the play. Likewise, the scenes involving the lawyers, were trimmed to sustain viewers’ interest.

Does being an actor help in becoming a good director?

Definitely, it does help. It helps in visualising the play, its scenes, characters, their movements and gestures. This translates in being able to brief the actors effectively about the scenes and emoting. I can see what I want and show it to them.

Does this curtail the spontaneity of the actors?

I allow actors to understand the character and situations, and enact and improvise accordingly. Having said that, not all actors are able to deliver what is expected on their own. I step in to enact, only when required.

How does stage design, lighting and music enhance the viewing of “Anahuta”?

Stage design and lighting are crucial for any play and essential in a thriller to accentuate the mystery and suspense. We coloured the walls in military green and grey, as the main characters are from the armed forces. Likewise, grey also depicts Sujata’s life as she is confronted by a person claiming to be her husband. We used orange, red, and violet lighting to portray conflict in the couple’s life. Music was confined to build the sequences, and heightening the suspense. We avoided its overuse lest it distract viewers’ attention.

How do you see the present state of Bangla theatre?

Theatre can never have a mass appeal. It is heartening that despite the proliferation of television, films, and digital entertainment, people still like live performances, and throng at the theatres to watch plays. Theatre enables actors to share emotions with the audience, then and there. We have young talent and audience for theatre, which is a good sign.

Does Bharat Rang Mahotsav help regional theatre to have a pan-India presence?

The Mahotsav gives an opportunity to connect with people knowing Bangla language outside the State and also meeting and exchanging views and suggestions with theatre personalities from other parts of India and the world. This is necessary to improve one’s skill.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/1xa80/article30820226.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Anahuta2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/sima-mukhopadhyays-talks-about-identity-crisis/article30820228.ece
314,2020/02/14,"Mamata Banerjee leads list of artists using canvas to protest against CAA, NRC","One of the works exhibited outside the Esplanade metro station in Kolkata is the creation of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who usually prefers the mike over the brush to express her anger.

The black canvas with a tricolour border has a human skull painted on it. The artwork is captioned: “Where has the Ashok Chakra gone? Symbol of death has replaced it!”

In the market the painting is likely to fetch a handsome price, because it is the creation of Jogen Chowdhury, one of Bengal’s leading living artists, but right now it’s on display — along with works of 44 other artists — on the pavement outside the Esplanade metro station in the heart of Kolkata. The idea is to convey to the masses the anger expressed by the artists against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the possibility of a National Register of Citizens.

One of the works exhibited is the creation of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who usually prefers the mike over the brush to express her anger, but here, her painting is conspicuous by its presence in the open-air gallery. “Eta madam er — This is madam’s painting,” policemen guarding the gallery inform curious onlookers.

Her work depicts a female face — perhaps Goddess Kali — and bears a message that says no to CAA, NRC and NPR (National Population Register). She has signed it as ‘Mamataa 2020’. The work of another artist, Subhaprasanna, shows a large saffron-coloured fish all set to gobble up smaller fishes of different hues.

All the paintings are on black canvas — symbolic of protest — and were done on the spot by the artists on January 28 at the Gandhi statue, before Ms. Banerjee decided to put them up on display. The exhibition was inaugurated on Wednesday by the state’s education minister Partha Chatterjee.

“The so-called torch-bearers of Hindutva are trying to seize our India against the wishes of her people and against the spirit of India,” informs the bilingual notice introducing the exhibition. “Our India is pluralist. It belongs to people of all religion, race and caste. Our country believes in the philosophy of ‘Jato Mat Tato Path’ (as many thoughts, so many ways).”

It goes on to say, “When people are being attacked or killed because they don’t conform to a certain ideology and when there’s a conspiracy to deport people from their own country by formation of so-called new laws, it makes us worried and shamed. So we lodge our silent protest against NRC and CAA through our free canvases.”

315,2020/02/14,Governor issues notice to Cooch Behar varsity V-C,"Dhankar asks why he has not received any intimation for holding the convocation

Raising questions on why he has not received any notice/ intimation for holding the convocation, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday issued a show-cause notice to the Vice-Chancellor of Cooch Behar Panchanan Barma University.

“Notice u/s 9 of Cooch Behar Panchanan Barma University Act has been issued to VC Debkumar Mukhopadhyay- thus setting process for consideration of his removal from the office of VC. His response u/s section 9(7) of Act has been sought within 14 days and he may avail oral hearing,” the Governor posted on his official Twitter handle.

A letter to the Vice-Chancellor made public by the Raj Bhavan stated that he may personally appear before the Governor on February 28 for an oral hearing of the matter.

Mr. Dhankhar had pointed out that four State Ministers have been invited to the university convocation on February 14.

“Chancellor, who has right to preside, has just no information! Where are we heading !,” the Governor’s tweet read.

Fresh war of words

The show-cause to the Vice-Chancellor may trigger a fresh war of words between the State’s ruling party and the Governor. While there was no reaction from the Trinamool Congress leadership, the Vice-Chancellor said he would reply to the Governor when he received the letter. “The convocation will be held as per schedule. The rules suggest that in the absence of Chancellor, the convocation could be presided by Vice-Chancellor. The whole debate is on social media and in media,” Mr. Mukhopadhyay said.

316,2020/02/14,Calicut University setting up student service centre,"3 lakh students to benefit from facility with toll-free number

Students from faraway districts may no longer have to come to the Calicut University campus to address their academic queries or spend a long time over the phone calling the information section to clear doubts.

The varsity is planning to have a student service centre with a toll-free number, modelled on customer care centres of companies.

Named ‘Digital Student Service Centre’, the civil works for the facility is almost complete and the tender process is going on. Around three lakh students will benefit from this. “We are trying if a student’s request for information or services could be solved within 24 hours,” V.L. Lajish, Director, Calicut University Computer Centre, said on Thursday.

The services would be available between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Calls after that would be recorded to be addressed the next day. Six persons had been trained to handle the calls. “If possible, the call centre staff will try to solve the issues. Otherwise, it will be directed to the section concerned. The student will get a message on their mobile phone or email after the complaint is registered. They can track its progress,” Mr. Lajish said. Along with this, information kiosks would be set up at the Tagore Nikethan where students can do online services on their own.

Mr. Lajish said that five more persons would be added to the staff at the call centre over a period of time. The effort would be to offer automated services in the future.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/calicut-university-setting-up-student-service-centre/article30817325.ece
317,2020/02/14,BJYM seeks NIA probe into missing of arms,"Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) activists took out a march to the Additional Director General of Police office here on Thursday seeking an NIA (National Investigation Agency) into the performance audit report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which brought to light serious lapses on the part of the police in handling arms and cartridges.

The protesters who were blocked in front of the ADGP’s office at Nadakkavu here, alleged that anti-national forces were suspected of having roles in the incident and it should be probed.

BJYM State president K.P. Prakash Babu who inaugurated the protest, held Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan “accountable for the negligence” and claimed that there were suspicious attempts to hide the security flaws and foster anti-national elements within the police force. “It was an incident that put our national and State security in danger. The rifles and cartridges were found lost from an area which was always under tight surveillance,” he said.

Mr. Babu claimed that the attempt to replace the lost stock with fresh ones was the first evidence to expose the suspected role of some of the top police officers in the incident. “We will go ahead with State-wide agitation and bring to light the truth,” he said.

The police had made elaborate security arrangements near the ADGP's office to manage the protesters. BJYM State secretary T.

322,2020/02/14,‘Gangaikondan Food Park announcement is not new’,"Industrialists are also upset over government’s failure to invigorate Nanguneri SEZ

The announcement in the State Budget that the Tamil Nadu Government has approved the establishment of a mega food park on 53.36 acres in Gangaikondan Industrial Promotion Centre on an outlay of ₹77.94 crore has not enthused the industrial fraternity here.

The reason is that it is only an old announcement made in mid-2018 wherein it was informed that the food park would be established at Gangaikondan at a cost of ₹200 crore.

“This is very much disappointing... An announcement, which was made by the officials on various occasions, has been made once again in the Assembly. It’s only an old wine in new bottle. If the announcement is translated into action at least now, we can appreciate the Tamil Nadu Government’s commitment on creating investor-friendly infrastructure in the State,” said an entrepreneur, who has his manufacturing unit in the Gangaikondan Industrial Promotion Centre.

The industrialists are also upset over the State Government’s failure to invigorate the 20-year-old Nanguneri multi-product Special Economic Zone.

“The unrealistic pricing of land in the SEZ and other allied reasons have collectively hit its growth,” the entrepreneur said.

Even as major investors are staying away from this SEZ, the Budget says that two of the proposed 13 more industrial parks to be established on 16,725 acres in six southern districts would come-up in Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli.

“What is the point in coming out with empty announcements like this when an advantageously situated location itself is struggling to see the light of the day. The official machinery should have the conviction to promote and develop the existing SEZ.

“The government is promoting only areas around Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts for industrial investments,” a leading exporter from Thoothukudi opined.

He also pointed out that the announcement on the proposal to construct desalination plant to meet drinking water needs of the SIPCOT Industrial Complex in Thoothukudi on an outlay of Rs. 634 crore was already made by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in the Assembly on July 13 last.

At the same time, the State Government’s decision to establish an Integrated Farmers’ Market Complex with the funding from NABARD’s Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure Fund, to create special centres for acid lime in Tenkasi and for chilly in Thoothukudi and to ensure housing for vulnerable communities living along waterways and water bodies, urban poor, migrant workers was hailed.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/y2wt4u/article30824150.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA15SEZTVL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/gangaikondan-food-park-announcement-is-not-new/article30824151.ece

324,2020/02/14,Madurai Corporation plans to treat sewage from Kiruthumal,"Officials say that the tender for the project has been called and that the work will commence in another 15 days

Madurai

The legendary Kiruthumal river here, which runs almost parallel to the Vaigai, has degenerated into a sewage carrier, owing to public neglect.

But, in a first-of-its-kind initiative in the city, the Corporation has planned to treat the sewage from the Kiruthumal and direct it towards the dry Sokkayee oorani (pond) at Chinthamani (ward 56). Corporation officials say that tender for the project has been called and that the work will commence in another 15 days.

A senior Corporation official says that the project has been proposed on a pilot basis as part of waterbodies restoration component under the Central government’s Jal Shakti Abhiyan. “Chithamani, which was annexed under the Corporation’s purview in 2011, does not have a well-connected underground drainage system and residents connect their septic tanks to the river. Hence, we decided to treat water from this portion of the river, which is highly polluted, and direct it to Sokkayee oorani,” says the official. According to the plan, a 300-metre-long PVC pipeline would connect Kiruthumal river on Keelatheru in Chinthamani to Sokkayee oorani located on Chintamani Main Road. The treatment of the sewage is undertaken through decentralised waste water treatment system.

Explaining its working, the official says, “Waste water enters septic tank through which heavy particles settle down. Then it passes through nine chambers where anaerobic decomposition takes place. Water is then routed through a gravel filter, where any addition of film of grease or oil settles down on pebbles. Water then passes through a polishing pond and finally reaches the pond,” he says.

K. Pandithurai, a long time resident of Chinthamani, says that the pond was earlier known as ‘Ganjendra oorani’. “According to history, when Goddess Meenakshi used to visit Chinthamani for an annual festival, her elephants used to take bath in this pond then. Earlier, a woman named ‘Sokkayee amma’ was taking care of a mandapam near the pond where Goddess Meenakshi used to take rest. Hence, over a period of time, the name of the pond got changed to Sokkayee oorani ” he says.

Mr. Pandithurai says that 30 years ago, the pond used to brim with water. “Earlier, the pond received water from the Panaiyur channel. But due to rapid urbanisation and encroachments by urban establishments, the inlet feeder of the pond is blocked. Today, only rainwater fills the pond for a few days,” he says.

Although there is no alarming water shortage at present, the groundwater tables are reducing gradually, says K. Sathaiyya, a resident of Chinna Anuppanadi.

“If water is available at the pond, it will help by recharging the groundwater level and improve the quality of water,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/jt4mdo/article30824053.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15MAPipeline,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/madurai-corporation-plans-to-treat-sewage-from-kiruthumal/article30824054.ece

A law student has moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the State to upgrade and install new dialysis units in all government taluk hospitals. He also sought a direction to fill up existing vacancies in the post of dialysis technicians.

In his petition, K. Pushpavanam of Madurai, a second-year law student, said as per the guidelines for dialysis centre published by the Directorate General of Health Services, each dialysis machine should be handled by a qualified technician.

In Tamil Nadu, there were only seven technicians appointed on temporary basis. Due to lack of technicians in government hospitals, staff nurses and students of dialysis technician course were handling the machines, he said.

Handling of dialysis machines without proper qualification was a threat to the lives of patients. He said in 2014, nearly 20 patients were infected with Hepatitis C virus after undergoing dialysis at Stanley Medical College Hospital in Chennai.

Therefore, steps must be taken to upgrade and install new dialysis units at government taluk hospitals and appoint adequate dialysis technicians, he said. A Division Bench of Justices M.

After a non-judicial member of Tamil Nadu State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission moved the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court over non-payment of salary in accordance with revised rules, the court directed the Centre and State to consider his representation and pass appropriate orders.

Taking cognisance of the fact that a representation made by the member was pending before authorities, Justice M.S. Ramesh observed that whenever a representation was made to a statutory authority to redress the claim of the employee, there was a duty cast on the authorities concerned to consider the same on merits and pass appropriate orders.

Instead of keeping the representation pending indefinitely, the authorities must consider and pass orders. Any inaction would amount to dereliction of duty, the court said and directed the Centre and the State to consider the representation made by the member, within a period of eight weeks.

However, the judge made it clear that the court had not expressed any of its view with regard to the claim made by the petitioner in the representation and it was for the authorities concerned to consider it in accordance with law.

The court was hearing the petition filed by S.M. Murugeshan from Madurai who said that he was appointed a whole-time non-judicial member of the forum in 2015.

The Theni District Forest Department has issued a ban on trekking in the Kurangani hills starting Saturday until the end of summer season as per State government directive as a precautionary measure due to forest fires.

Theni District Forest Officer S. Gowtham said that the department has rejected permissions to trek in the Kurangani region as there has already been one reported fire in the last 10 days.

“Although we closed trekking in late January last year, we had an extended monsoon in 2020 and hence had conducive trekking conditions.

Since it is summer again, we are officially issuing our trekking ban starting tomorrow,” the District Forest Officer said.

Forest fires start in January, increase in February and peak during March.

In 2020 alone, the Forest department has received about 200 applications to use the authorised 11.4 kms pathway uproute from Kurangani to Top Station via Central station.

A statement from the forest department explained that action will be taken against those who trespass the order and that one will be culpable if they carry explosive equipment inside the forest.

The District Forest Officer added that the public can report fires to 04546-252552 or reach out to the disaster management team available at 1077.

He was speaking at the 54th annual day celebrations of Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Vidyalayam here on Friday.

The judge handed out degree certificates to six students who received their undergraduate degree certificates in BA Music and honoured others on the occasion. He also watched a cultural programme on dance, vocal music, veena, violin and mridangam performances by the students.

“The demand for classical music across the world has come down. A radio station in New Zealand shut down their classical music hour and its Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern came out against the broadcasting cuts. If we too need to protect our identity, we must preserve Carnatic music,” the judge said.

He also congratulated the evening music school for making efforts to promote arts and culture. The judge added that he was attempting to contribute his two cents to this music world by learning the kanjira, an instrument from the tambourine family.

“There is a strong link between music and law. While music is a disciplined means of speaking, law is a disciplined way of establishing civil society,” he said. He added that only a few achieve it to perfection and congratulated the Vidyalayam for producing talents among young students.

President of the Vidyalayam R. Srinivasan, Principal V. Bala and Secretary S.

Venkatesan. The differently abled would get walking sticks, wheelchairs, spectacles and hearing aid.

The MP told The Hindu on Friday that the camps would have seven officials each from Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India (ALIMCO) (Southern Division) and from Public Health department in the 13 unions of Madurai to document the needs of differently abled persons. According to the 2011 Census, there were around 45,000 people with disabilities in Madurai district, but the current estimate was around 55,000, he said.

ALIMCO, which was headquartered in Kanpur, would make these instruments within two months and the same would be distributed to those who sought assistance under the scheme later, he said.

“I wrote to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment on November 18, 2019, and have been following up with it since then because such a ‘mela’ of assistive instruments had not taken place in Madurai for years. Any help is a major requirement for those from low socio-economic background,” he said.

330,2020/02/14,Transgender turns a page by starting a library in Dindigul,"‘It will give the community people confidence to face their life in a dignified manner’

In a first of its kind, a transgender Gunavathi, founder of “Thaaikoodu” has launched a library here for the benefit of the community and among others on Friday.

Speaking on the occasion, CPI (M) former MLA Balabharathi said that disseminating knowledge is a good initiative. In a society, when the transgender community was fighting several odds, the initiative of Gunavathi was commendable. “The library should help the transgenders come to the mainstream and give them the confidence to face challenges boldly,” she added.

The State government should encourage transgenders, who have been sidelined and have not been given the due recognition, she said. Explaining the background of Gunavathi, the former MLA said that despite having completed M.Sc. Psychology, Gunavathi, who has been working in the Government Hospital here since 2013, was yet to be given a confirmation.

Like Gunavathi, there were many transgenders, who would shine if given proper recognition by the official machinery, Ms. Balabharathi said. She appealed to the TN government to provide them employment as economic upliftment would prevent the transgenders from attempting to end their lives or indulge in other means for their livelihood.

Thanking the donors who had gifted close to 1,500 books for the library, Gunavathi said that they had originally planned to start the library on March 8, 2019. However, they faced difficulties in getting space for rent in the town. With great difficulty, the library has been opened and she hoped the books here would be well utilised by the locals.

The transgenders should equip themselves with knowledge as it would give them the confidence to face their lives in a dignified manner. The Thaikoodu founder appealed to philanthropists to come forward and contribute liberally for the development of the library, which would be the first library started by a transgender in Tamil Nadu, Gunavathi felt.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/y8yn7a/article30822316.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA15LIBRARYDGL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/transgender-turns-a-page-by-starting-a-library-in-dindigul/article30822317.ece

According to prosecution, Veeranan of Anaikarai in Idukki district lodged a complaint with Vandanmedu police that his son Rajesh Kannan, 17, was missing. Preliminary inquiries revealed that he had told his parents that he would go to Kumili with some of his friends, but never returned home.

Discreet probe by police teams suggested that he was last seen in the company of his friend Joan in an auto rickshaw. When police zeroed in on Joan and two other friends, identified as V. Vineet and B. Santosh of Idukki district, they admitted to have been to a waterfall in the area.

Based on their confessions, it came to light that Rajesh Kannan told Joan to stop speaking to his sister. This had irked Joan, who along with his friends, allegedly pushed Rajesh Kannan to his death near the waterfall. The body, which was badly injured, was identified by the family members following which it was sent for post mortem.

The man missing case was subsequently altered to murder and the police registered a case under IPC Section 302.

Karunamoorthy.

Speaking at the fishermen grievance redressal meeting held at the Collectorate, he charged that the Fisheries Minister and the officials allegedly connived with select fishermen, who were using the banned fishnet knowing well that it caused harm to the environment.

The government should stop fishermen from using the banned nets and also implement the law with an iron hand, he urged. If the officials failed to act now, the fishing industry would face acute problems, Mr. Karunamoorthy claimed.

In his address, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said that the government would look into the grievances of the fishermen and take steps to redress it.

He said that the district had the advantage of a vast sea front measuring 237 kilometres. There were about 180 fisherfolk villages and around 1,500 mechanised boats and another 4,500 country boats in the district. Next to agriculture, fishing sector was a major industry in which thousands of people were engaged in various activities directly and indirectly.

As part of the welfare measures, the government has issued bio-metric cards, identity cards, provided tokens and communication devices to the fishermen. There were other agencies, which monitored the movement of the fishermen setting off to sea.

Stating that the government has been pro-active in dissemination, the Collector said that an App - Thoondil - provided a number of information to fishermen setting off to sea.

Many other fishermen representatives also submitted petitions to Mr. Rao and hoped to get relief. Deputy Director (Fisheries) M. V. Prabavathi, Sub-Collector Dr. Sukaputra, ASP A.

Venkatesan said that until this year, there has been a huge shortage of manpower and funds to carry out research, particularly in places like Keeladi and Adichanallur

Madurai Member of Parliament Su. Venkatesan said that the allocation of ₹31.93 crore for the Department of Archaeology would do wonders for research and development in Tamil Nadu.

Speaking to The Hindu from Delhi, the MP said that until this year, there has been a huge shortage of manpower and funds to carry out research, particularly in places like Keeladi and Adichanallur.

“The amount will go towards fostering a better understanding of Tamil Nadu’s contribution to documenting the history of ancient civilisations. It is nice to see that the results at Keeladi have spurred the government to allocate more money to take a deeper look into where we have come from,” he said.

He added that the amount coupled with ₹12.20 crore to construct an international-level museum in Konthagai village located 12 km away from Madurai, will surely help reconstructing past history.

“The State government should ensure that they form a committee of experts from the fields of history, anthropology, archaeology and literature to determine how the museum should be built. If it is merely a department exercise, it will not have the necessary perspectives and will not provide a wholesome Tamil perspective,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/o1vkmv/article30820559.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14FEBTH-SUVENKATESAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/tn-budget-2020-21-allocation-for-archaeology-dept-will-help-in-reconstruction-of-states-history-says-madurai-mp/article30820560.ece
334,2020/02/14,Over 15 tonnes of used cooking oil dispatched from Madurai to Telangana for bio-fuel production,"The oil was collected from 222 shops in the city that used more than 40 litres of oil a day

District Collector T.G. Vinay flagged off a tanker lorry carrying around 15.5 tonnes of used cooking oil collected by the Food Safety Department under the Repurpose Used Cooking Oil (RUCO) scheme, an initiative of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), from the Collectorate, here on Friday. The collected oil was dispatched to a FSSAI-recognised plant based in Telangana for the production of bio-fuel.

The RUCO initiative, which was launched in Madurai in October last year, aims to prevent repeated use of cooking oil and to have it converted into bio-fuel.

Designated Officer for Food Safety S. Somasundaram said that used oil was collected from 222 shops in the city, which used more than 40 litres of oil every day. A team of 19 food safety officers were involved in the collection of the oil for the last two months.

“This is just the initial phase in the implementation of the RUCO scheme. Through regular awareness programmes, we are aiming to reach a target of collecting around 300 tonnes of used oil from Madurai,” said Mr. Somasundaram. The establishments were paid ₹25 for each litre of cooking oil.

335,2020/02/14,China power demand drops as coronavirus shutters plants,"The reduction is the energy equivalent of about 30 million tonnes of thermal coal or about 9 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG), IHS said.

China's industrial power demand in 2020 may decline by as much as 73 billion kilowatt hours (kWh), according to IHS Markit, as the outbreak of the coronavirus has curtailed factory output and prevented some workers from returning to their jobs.

The cut represents about 1.5% of industrial power consumption in China. But, as the country is the world's biggest electricity consumer, the loss is equal to the power used in the whole of Chile and it illustrates the scope of the disruption caused by the outbreak.

The reduction is the energy equivalent of about 30 million tonnes of thermal coal or about 9 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG), IHS said. The coal figure is more than China's average monthly imports last year while the LNG figure is a little more than one month of imports, based on customs data.

China has tried to curtail the spread of the coronavirus that has killed more than 1,400 and infected over 60,000 by extending the Lunar New Year holiday for an extra week and encouraging people to work from home.

Last year, industrial users consumed 4.85 trillion kWh electricity, accounting for 67% of the country's total.

Xizhou Zhou, the global head of power and Renewables at IHS Markit, said that in a severe case where the epidemic goes on past March, China's economic growth will be only 4.2% during 2020, down from an initial forecast of 5.8%, while power consumption will climb by only 3.1%, down from 4.1% initially.

“The main uncertainty is still how fast the virus will be brought under control,” said Zhou, adding that the impact on the power sector will be relatively modest from a full-year picture in 2020.

In Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, the peak power load at the end of January was 21% less than planned, data from Wood Mackenzie showed.

Industrial operating rates point to a firm reduction in power consumption in China.

Utilisation rates at plastic processors are between 30% and 60% and the low levels are expected to last for another two week, according to ICIS China.

Weaving machines at textile plants are operating at below 10% of capacity, the lowest in five years, ICIS data showed.

India urgently needs more ambitious structural and financial sector reform measures and a medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy due to the rising debt levels while ensuring a more accommodative fiscal stance in the budget, the IMF has said.

Responding to a question on the budget presented by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, International Monetary Fund (IMF) spokesperson Gerry Rice said the economic environment in India is weaker than what the organisation had forecast earlier.

“While the budget touches on ongoing sectoral efforts, there remains an urgent need for more ambitious structural and financial sector reform measures and a medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy, anchored in tangible revenue and expenditure measures, especially given rising debt levels,” Mr. Rice said.

“The environment is weaker than what we had forecast earlier, that a more accommodative fiscal stance, this year, is appropriate, so that more accommodative fiscal stance in the budget, we think, is appropriate,” he said.

“But, over the medium term, to be looking at a fiscal consolidation strategy,” Mr. Rice said.

341,2020/02/14,Should women be given command posts in the Army?,"Like men, women should be judged on the basis of their professionalism and merit

Last week, in response to an ongoing hearing in the Supreme Court on permanent commission for women officers, the government cited “physical” and “physiological limitations” in granting command positions to women officers in the Indian Army. To this, the Supreme Court responded that there is a need for administrative will and “change of mindset”. In a conversation moderated by Dinakar Peri, Lieutenant General Syed Ata Hasnain and Lieutenant General D.S. Hooda discuss this question. Excerpts:

Could you provide an overview of the reasoning behind the government’s stand?

Lt Gen Hasnain: Till September 2019, permanent commission for women was restricted to only two departments: the Army Education Corps and the Judge Advocate General’s branch. In September, the Defence Ministry announced that it is opening this up to eight other arms and services from April this year, for women already selected for the Short Service Commission. So, permanent commission now is open in 10 departments, or what you call arms and services. Now, women’s careers can be furthered only if they get what are called command assignments or criteria appointments. The question is, how do you define a criteria appointment? The Indian Army is what is called a command-oriented Army. That is, anyone who has to be given further positions up the chain of command has to first be experienced in command at the level of a full Colonel, a unit command. So far, this was denied to women. That is the main issue.

My opinion is that the time has come for us to at least experiment, if nothing else, and that experiment needs to be done first with the Services — Army Service Corps, Army Ordnance Corps and Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. In all these there are women who have been commissioned for the last 30 years as Short Service Commissioned officers. Many of them have commanded workshops. Some of them are in a position to be selected. The focus is on the word selected because they have to be selected through their confidential reports, a board of officers, a promotion board, which will determine whether they are fit to command. Only then will they command a unit.

Gen Hooda, apart from the point about gaining acceptability from other soldiers, the government has argued that there are other issues such as motherhood and domestic obligations. Do you believe that these are stumbling blocks in women holding command positions? For the last 30 years we have had women in the Army.

Lt Gen Hooda: There are challenges — domestic issues, fitness, pregnancy — all that has been quoted by the government in its affidavit. But this is an argument we had 30 years ago when we were inducting women into the Army. All these issues have been handled by the Army in a very mature manner over the years.

Coming specifically to the issue of whether they should be given command or not, there is very little justification in saying that while women officers can be company commanders, platoon commanders, second in command, [they should be excluded] when it comes to command appointments, commanding a unit, only on the basis that they are women. This argument doesn’t hold water. As Lt Gen Hasnain said, there is a board of officers to decide whether promotions to the rank of Colonel can take place or not for a particular officer. It’s not as if all male officers get automatically promoted as Colonels. In some cases, in some services, less than 30% of male officers are promoted to the rank of Colonel. The decision is made by a board of officers. Let the same board of officers decide whether a woman officer is fit to command a unit. Women should be judged on the basis of their professionalism and on the basis of merit.

The Commanding Officer holds a very significant position in the Army. What distinguishes the command positions and what’s the way forward to have women in these roles?

Lt Gen Hasnain: Let’s understand it from a career management angle as well as a functional angle. What are criteria appointments which someone has to fulfil before they can be promoted to even higher ranks? These appointments can be directly in command of troops or many times they are also not in command of troops. For example, there can be appointments in the Army Education Corps and the Judge Advocate General’s branch or such things where you have a certain responsibility, but you are not directly commanding troops. There are arms and services such as the Army Service Corps and Electrical and Mechanical Engineers where you have resources under your command and you have a large number of personnel under your command. In the Engineers Corps, a criteria appointment could be to set up an appointment such as the Commander Works Engineer who is responsible largely for projects of maintenance, of a lot of construction assets, and things like that, and very little responsibility for the personnel under you. So, there is a whole range of such responsibilities.

But the one important aspect is that the difference between a sub-unit command and the command by a Commanding Officer is that the Commanding Officer is the place where the buck stops. So the question many are asking is, do women have it in them to be able to accept that kind of responsibility? And will they be able to exercise that authority over male personnel under them? Now, this has only been experienced in sub-units where there could be 100-120 men serving under a lady officer of rank of a Major or Lieutenant Colonel and they have done extremely well in those appointments. So there is nothing wrong in giving them command assignments. That is why I said let’s experiment with it. Give it a five-year period, and if you find something drastically wrong, which I’m sure you will not, then maybe you can give it a review. But on the face of it, denying them this opportunity only on the basis of their gender is not legally correct, I think, though of course the Supreme Court will decide that. I don’t think it is morally correct. Because now that you have given them permanent commission, you’ve given them this on the basis of the assumption that they are equally good [as men], they’re responsible, and they can be developed to become better, I think it’s incumbent on the organisation to actually repose a certain level of trust in them and give them these command responsibilities.

Gen Hooda, you had written that there is some merit in not having women in combat roles. Can you elaborate on this?

Lt Gen Hooda: I think there is some justification in not permitting women in combat roles at this time. There are issues about soldiers and officers living on the front lines. Officers and their men all live together in, say, one bunker along the Line of Control. So, there are issues and if you are going to induct women in Combat Arms, try and shield them from some of these more difficult roles. At this stage, it could only invite more resentment regarding why we are having women in Combat Arms. We should keep that debate for later. Let’s start with mainstreaming those arms and services where women already are present.

You had mentioned stressful conditions like working in close proximity on the front lines. Now we’re talking about command positions, but combat roles in front line combat will come up after that. How can these issues be addressed?

Lt Gen Hooda: We need to look at things in a more practical manner. We’ve already started inducting women as permanent commission in some of the supporting arms and services. We need to completely integrate all the people in the Army, and that includes women officers. It’s ridiculous that we are fighting battles in court. The Supreme Court might give some judgment based on its wisdom. But within the Army, if we can internally resolve these issues, that will be a much better approach. So let’s look at both sides of the debate. And the fact is, you have to integrate women better in the Army, you have to give them their professional aspirations, their personal aspirations have to be met. Let’s start debating this and see how everyone can be pulled together. Frankly, some of the arguments that have been made in the Court — I dare say I’m using this word with a little caution — are regressive, and don’t reflect the reality on the ground today.

What were your efforts in this direction?

Lt Gen Hasnain: That’s a good question. I admit that I started with a negative mindset myself, way back in 1991. But my mind changed very early because of the demonstrated capability on the ground. In almost every arm and service, I visited in my own division on the Line of Control, I saw a detachment of engineers working feverishly on a particular operational track and the person commanding that detachment and spending time on the deck of the bulldozer at night, for three to four weeks with the men, was a lady officer. Thereafter, there have been many occasions where I’ve seen young women, convoy commanders, who’ve done a marvellous job under the most challenging circumstances in cases of ambushes on the Uri-Baramulla road.

Lt Gen Hooda: I will give you two stories. In 2005, I took over command of the Brigade from Lt Gen Hasnain, and we had this earthquake in September 2005. My Brigade Major wasn’t there [in Uri]. The officer below him, the captain who is called the G3, was injured. And we had no officers there, we were completely cut off. The Education Officer, Captain Rosie, performed the role of Brigade Major and she handled the whole operational side. Hats off to the way she handled it. So, I have no doubts about women officers handling responsibilities during a crisis. Then we had Colonel Santosh Mahadik, Commanding Officer of a unit, when I was the Army Commander, who was killed while fighting terrorists in September 2015. When my wife went to pay condolences, his wife said she wanted to join the Army. She was 35 years old, 10 years older than anybody who can get commissioned into the Officers Training Academy. We took up her case. She got commissioned in 2017 as a Lieutenant in the Ordnance (Corps). Now, the inspiration we get from her story is beyond words.

Generals, in retrospect, would you have taken orders from a woman officer?

Lt Gen Hasnain: Without blinking an eye, if someone above me, whether man or woman, was someone who demonstrated capability and leadership qualities, there is no question that I would not accept directions, orders. In the Army, we are trained to do that. It’s just a mindset [regarding women], we need to overcome that. I would have overcome it almost immediately.

Lt Gen Hooda: Soldiers respect professionalism, good leadership, irrespective of whether it is demonstrated by a male or female officer.

342,2020/02/14,The Kashmir despatch before the Internet,"Communication links were open even in the worst days of militancy in J&K

On October 31 last year, after many years I waited in queue to email a news story to The Hindu. The place was a government-designated media centre in Srinagar and it was on the day the State of Jammu and Kashmir was formally reduced to a Union Territory.

Scores of reporters thronged the Information Department’s media centre on Residency Road, hoping that one of the dozen-odd computers would be free. It had almost become a habit given that nearly three months had passed since Internet services had been snapped in the Valley.

For me, there was a sense of déjà vu with a twist. It took me back to the scary days of December 1989, when I first travelled to the Kashmir Valley to cover the turmoil and violence in the region as a young reporter for The Hindu and Frontline.

In those days, the fax machine was pretty revolutionary technology. You even got a ‘transmission’ report once the pages were received on the other side. But it was a tough job to dial and connect to Madras, as Chennai was called then, or to Delhi.

The telex machine was more reliable and, when all else failed, there were alert ‘teleprinter operators’ of the newspaper who would take down our stories on the telephone. It was part of their job.

Most of my visits (1989-1995) to Srinagar began with navigating the curfew and hiring a vehicle to move around, a task in itself. The only good thing was that Kashmiri leaders not in detention were always to be found at home.

After a day of newsgathering, I would go to the Central Telegraph Office and begin the arduous task of sending my story for the day, which was written on a typewriter either at Ahdoos Hotel or the Broadway Hotel when they were open during the early days of militancy.

One day is etched in my memory. I entered the Central Telegraph Office, said hello to the heavily armed BSF guards outside, managed to fax my story, and then heard a loud bang outside. One of the BSF men I had spoken to had been hit by a militant bullet. It was tragic and surreal.

There were days when one page went by fax, the other on telex, and the third by telephone. Every day was an experience and, post-transmission, I would make a landline call to my News Editor, K. Narayanan, or Mr. KN, to confirm that the story had reached his desk.

There were other occasions when we went to a friendly police officer’s house to file copy if there was a big rush at the Central Telegraph Office. I am ever grateful to those friendly civil servants. The day only ended when I was able to send my story.

Even in the worst days of militancy and curfew, the Central Telegraph Office was open to all journalists who could access it. The administration never shut it down; it was one mode of communication available to all. Landline services were not shut down either, in Srinagar or the rest of the Valley. The fact that in the worst period of militancy communication links were open is testimony to the commitment of previous governments to the freedom of press. Today’s frequent Internet shutdowns are a blot on our democracy.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/k9cjwd/article30812534.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14thphone,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-kashmir-despatch-before-the-internet/article30812535.ece
343,2020/02/14,A marriage story for everyone,"The Kerala High Court has an opportunity to make the concept of marriage less exclusionary

The only thing that is ‘special’ about the Special Marriage Act of 1954 is that it allows and facilitates the registration of inter-religious marriages. In that sense, it is a legislative tool for social change, an attempt to remove a social barrier to the exercise of individual autonomy. In the last few years, the Supreme Court has championed the cause of individual autonomy in matters of love, sex and marriage, including in Shafin Jahan v. Asokan (2018), Shakti Vahini v. Union of India (2018) and Navtej Johar v. Union of India (2018). In Navtej Johar, not only did the Court hold Section 377 of the IPC to be unconstitutional, it explicitly recognised the rights of the LGBTQ+ community to express their individuality, sexual identity and love on par with heterosexuals, as fundamental to Articles 14 (right to equality), 19 (right to freedom), and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution.

Discrimination

A petition recently filed in the Kerala High Court by a male same-sex couple challenges the constitutionality of the Special Marriage Act on the ground that it discriminates against same-sex couples who want to formalise their relationship through marriage. At one level it seeks a simple and logical extension of the rights already recognised by the Supreme Court in Navtej Johar — the right of same-sex couples to express their sexual identity, right to privacy and non-interference in the conduct of their personal affairs, and the right to be recognised as full members of society. To refuse their plea would cause them very real, tangible damage, considering that marriage carries a range of legal rights and protections, available during the marriage as well as on its dissolution by divorce (the right to seek maintenance) or death (the right to inherit property).

A more esoteric, but no less devastating, deprivation caused would be the inaccessibility of symbols that are germane to how people visualise their identities and envisage their relationships. For better or for worse, marriage continues to be the cornerstone of social legitimacy and family in India. For most people, marriage, commitment and family are not abstract legal concepts, but stages of human development and aspiration which give meaning to their personal lives. They represent the sanctification and extension of the deep emotional and spiritual bonds that may often accompany sexual intimacy.

Aside from blatant homophobia, which the law ought not to legitimise, the reasons commonly cited as to why these symbols should be the preserve of opposite-sex couples do not stand scrutiny. Purportedly, the social purpose of marriage is to provide stability; financial, physical or emotional care and support; sexual intimacy and love to individuals; and to facilitate procreation and child-rearing. Aside from procreation, none of these objectives are dependent on the gender of the parties concerned, so much as on the bond they share and their ability to make the relationship work. And if procreation were quite so central to marriage, opposite-sex couples would be required to prove their fertility and, indeed, commit to having children before being allowed to register their marriage. As we know, that is not the case. The right or the legal ability to marry, it would appear, has little to do with the reasons commonly cited to deny marriage to same-sex couples. Therefore, any consideration of the law of marriage ought to be completely divorced from the mould that marriage is socially expected to fit.

A unique opportunity

The petition before the Kerala High Court represents a unique opportunity — a potential first step towards making marriage, as an institution, as a legal concept, more accessible and egalitarian, less arbitrary and exclusionary. It gives the High Court the chance to prioritise the fundamental and human rights of the petitioners over the abstract heteronormative tendency of the majority to deny legitimacy to relationships that challenge oppressive social structures and established hierarchies. In other words, it’s high time love and logic are given a chance to triumph over homophobic tradition.

344,2020/02/14,Heralding a politics of change,"The Delhi verdict was reflective of the city’s, in particular the youths’, resistance to the BJP’s divisive, hate-filled approach

As we get used to the spectacular victory of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the Delhi election, it is important to also take note of the characterisation of the win by its leaders as an endorsement of what they term as their ‘politics of change’. They insist that this model of policymaking has marked a shift from the politics of vacuous promises to one of work on the ground. However, even as one grants the AAP leaders this boast, it is equally important to note that the change in politics began a little earlier and for a different set of reasons. But let us first have a look at the salient meaning of the Delhi poll.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal realised early that his strong electoral plank was his government’s accomplishments in the area of social welfare — provision of affordable education, healthcare, water and electricity — and that his party’s chief rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had nothing to offer on this front. The BJP, he understood, would thus seek to draw him into an agenda which has given it several victories: a programme featuring communal hatred masquerading as nationalism. The passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the project of National Register of Citizens/National Population Register set the background for the BJP’s characteristically aggressive campaign. The protests against these, symbolised by Shaheen Bagh, gave it further context. Mr. Kejriwal wisely chose to fight the election on his own, rather than on the BJP’s, terms.

Support across sections

It is remarkable that the AAP received support from affluent colonies like Greater Kailash, Vasant Vihar, as well as colonies of the underprivileged, like Govind Puri and Seelampur; the party gained approval of both the highly educated voters in New Delhi and South Delhi and the supposedly illiterate villagers. Clearly, voters in the richer areas did not choose Mr. Kejriwal for giving them free water and electricity but over something bigger. These were issues that concerned them, but not them alone, in defining the nation.

This concern began with a visible, almost forcible, redefining of the nation by the BJP along the path of ‘Hindu Rashtra’. This was not the path Indians had inherited from their history, which had always celebrated their civilisation’s pluralism. There was also concern over the BJP’s brazenly partisan use of the state apparatus, including police and bureaucracy.

Unprovoked thrashing of students at Jamia Millia Islamia by policemen and the latter’s protection to goons with masked faces who entered the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) were widely witnessed on TV channels for days, and met with public condemnation. Incidentally, there has not been a single arrest over the JNU incident so far.

Protests against the CAA, as well as in response to police action and inaction, took place in civil society — in the form of silent, passive, non-violent satyagraha marches and sit-ins, especially with women at the forefront. Shaheen Bagh became a marker for such acts of resistance. That the protests became widespread all over the country, from the invisible corners of small towns to other metros, brought the larger issue to the forefront. These protests were unconnected with either political parties or electoral battles and therefore left the government resourceless.

It is this attempt by the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah duo to fundamentally alter the character of the nation, and the civil society’s resistance to their designs, that has brought about a change in the pursuit of politics. Shaheen Bagh formed the centrepiece of the BJP’s campaign in Delhi, with hate-filled slogans by its top leaders and second-rung politicians like Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma acting as a counter to Mr. Kejriwal’s focus on social welfare. The BJP clearly made the election a referendum for its CAA/NRC/NPR and for its communal vitriolic, in other words its version of nationalism. The voters responded with their verdict.

The youth deserted the BJP

The biggest loss to the BJP’s support base in this election was from the youth. Until a year ago, a portion of India’s young generation formed the unquestioning, adoring fan base of Mr. Modi even if they were not committed to the BJP or trained in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) shakhas. However, the CAA has made them aware of the unabashedly divisive politics of the government headed by Mr. Modi and they have refused to fall for it.

Here, a very interesting indicator is the fact that the BJP’s vitriol in public is now being met with roars of disapproval from the crowd. The youth are at the forefront of this condemnation of the BJP’s ‘divide and rule’ policy. And, they have voiced their disapproval through ballot power.

Will the Delhi elections persuade the BJP to abandon or even modify its strategy of spreading hatred for mobilising electoral support? The party can adopt a different approach if it has an alternative economic or social vision. But generating an alternative vision will require it to change its fundamental character, its organising principle.

It is noticeable that far from cautioning its leaders against the use of vitriol during the Delhi campaign, the BJP’s top leaders extended full support to them through their eloquent silence. Now, after the party’s resounding defeat, a line of argument propagated in BJP circles is that the Delhi voters neglected grave issues of religion and nationalism for the sake of freebies.

It is the tension between this inability of the BJP to change and the growing urge and energy for change at the ground level among the voters that will constitute the political and social dynamics of India in the next few years.

345,2020/02/14,Managing perceptions: On envoys visit to J&K,"What should worry India is the ground reality in Kashmir, not the views of other countries

The Centre’s decision to take another group of envoys on a guided tour of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), and the stated hope of the Ministry of External Affairs that these tours will become a regular feature, point to a belief that these visits have been productive. Clearly, the government, which has been under considerable international pressure to lift restrictions in the former State, has managed to arrange these three visits without any incident. The delegations have been taken to meet with local groups, and shown a glimpse of ‘normalcy’ in the Kashmir Valley, with shops open, people out on the streets, and boating on the Dal Lake. After these tours, no envoy has come forward with any negative account, which indicates that at least for the moment, the government’s narrative has prevailed. The visits have also smoothed other diplomatic exchanges. U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Juster’s trip to J&K paved the way for President Donald Trump’s upcoming visit, and the latest visit by European Ambassadors was timed just before Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar travels to Brussels to prepare for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s trip next month for the EU-India summit. However, the government must recognise that these gains in the immediate present are superficial in the absence of a change in the situation in Kashmir.

It would not have escaped anyone’s attention that these tours are tightly controlled, and the people meeting the foreign guests in the confines of the Raj Bhavan are handpicked by the government. In fact, European delegates who accepted New Delhi’s invitation on this trip had earlier opted out in order to request freer access and meetings with leaders in detention, but the government refused to relent. The chimera of ‘normalcy’ seems patently fragile: the visit had to be postponed by a day due to a bandh call in the Valley; and just a day after the visit, the Internet was snapped once again due to security concerns. It is also puzzling how the government, which has repeated often that J&K is an “internal affair”, squares it up with this new policy of conducting tours for the international community. The truth is, managing India’s image is important, but the government’s primary responsibilities still lie within its borders — responsibilities to the people of J&K, who have yet to see a return to normalcy; to those detained in and outside J&K, including sitting Member of Parliament and octogenarian Farooq Abdullah, against whom little evidence of wrongdoing has been furnished; and to the people of India as a whole, who are yet to see a credible path to the peace and prosperity that was promised when the momentous decision on Article 370 was announced last August. It is their legitimate expectations, not those of the international community, that must be a priority for the government.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/managing-perceptions-the-hindu-editorial-on-envoys-visit-to-jk/article30813292.ece
346,2020/02/14,Terror and punishment: On Hafiz Saeed conviction,"Pakistan must give up its strategy of using terrorism for geopolitical leverage

The Pakistani government, which for years tried to protect Hafiz Saeed, the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, finally got a conviction and a jail term for the cleric in two terror financing cases. The Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief and his close aide Malik Zafar Iqbal have been sentenced to five-and-a-half years by an anti-terrorism court, vindicating India’s years-long position that Saeed had been using his organisations to finance terrorist activities. While the conviction is a welcome step, Pakistan has to do more if it wants the international community to take its self-declared resolve to fight terror seriously. This is because Pakistan’s actions in the past against terrorist outfits have hardly been convincing. It started cracking down on Saeed’s groups in 2018 only after it was threatened to be put on the “grey list” of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body fighting money laundering and terror financing. The government endorsed the UN ban on these organisations in February 2018, just a few days ahead of an FATF meeting. Despite these actions, Pakistan was placed on the grey list.

Unsurprisingly, the conviction of Saeed and Iqbal comes a few days ahead of another crucial FATF meeting. In the 2019 October meeting, the organisation had warned Islamabad to take “extra measures” for the “complete” elimination of terror financing and money laundering. And if the FATF is not satisfied with Pakistan’s actions, the country faces the risk of being downgraded to the “black list”, which could bring tough sanctions on its financial system. So, Pakistan is evidently under international pressure. The question is whether its actions are half-hearted steps aimed at avoiding the wrath of the international community or part of a genuine drive against terror. One can’t blame if India, Afghanistan or any other country doubts Pakistan’s intentions, given that Islamabad had avoided taking action against Saeed and his groups for years. Saeed was put under house arrest several times, only to be released once the international attention turned away. The fundamental problem is Pakistan’s policy of exporting terrorism to its neighbours for geopolitical leverage. Historically, Pakistan has adopted a dual policy towards terrorism — fight it at home but export it through proxies to its neighbours. Unless it changes this policy and joins the regional drive against terrorism, peace and stability would elude the region. This remains a critical issue in Indo-Pak ties as well. So, the international community shouldn’t let up its pressure on Pakistan. Islamabad should be asked to take, not just legal action against terror financing, but also hard measures against terror groups and infrastructure.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/terror-and-punishment-the-hindu-editorial-on-hafiz-saeed-conviction/article30813318.ece
347,2020/02/14,Police will follow SOP on noise pollution complaints: State to HC,"Affidavit was submitted by the State Director-General and Inspector General of Police Praveen Sood

The State government on Friday told the Karnataka High Court that a standard operating procedure (SOP) will be followed by the police to initiate action in cases of complaints of noise pollution.

In an affidavit, the State Director-General and Inspector General of Police Praveen Sood said that the station house officer (SHO), who receives a complaint of noise pollution from a citizen, shall immediately transmit the summery of the complaint to the officer or the authorities authorised to make a complaint in this regard in the jurisdictional court.

Further, the SHO will immediately request the nearest/jurisdictional Regional Environmental Officer (or the Deputy Superintendent of Police, once the noise decibel meters are acquired by the Police Department), any other authorised officer, to reach (along with said SHO) the location, where the noise rules are being violated, and ensure that reading of the noise level is recorded on the noise decibel meters and the noise emitting device is turned off, the State Police Chief has stated.

The affidavit was submitted before a division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar during the hearing of a PIL petition complaining about noise pollution by pubs, bars and restaurants in Indiranagar.

The SOP was prepared as the court had earlier pointed out that the police lack awareness on initiating action on complaints of noise pollution.

Also, the SHO will have to draw up a mahazar along with the Regional Environmental Officer or the authorised officer, serve a copy of the same on the owner of the land, shut down the device which caused pollution and seize the noise causing equipment, if the SHO apprehends that the use of such noise pollutant could be repeated.

The SHO, the affidavit stated, within a reasonable time, would prepare a detailed report and enclose a copy of the mahazar, and forward the report to the authorised officer with a request to take immediate steps to prosecute the offenders under provisions of the Environmental Protection (EP) Act, 1985.

On failure of the authorised officer to take action as contemplated in the EP Act within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of report, the SHO is required to prepare a complaint on his own and submit in the jurisdictional court seeking permission to prosecute the officer, it has been explained in the affidavit.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-will-follow-sop-on-noise-pollution-complaints-state-to-hc/article30824152.ece
348,2020/02/14,Residents stall demolition of illegal building,"BBMP demolished a portion of the compound wall before learning that the High Court had ordered status quo till Monday

Residents of a building in Puttenahalli staged a protest on Friday morning when BBMP officials, along with police and personnel from the Fire and Emergency Services, arrived with JCB machines to demolish the four-storey structure as the builder had violated the rules.

“The High Court had recently ruled that the building is illegal. It directed the BBMP to demolish the building by February 18 and submit a report on the action taken,” said Ramakrishna, Joint Commissioner, Bommanahalli zone, BBMP.

Around 25 families staged a protest to stop the demolition and pleaded with BBMP officials to reconsider their decision.

BBMP officials demolished a portion of the compound wall when they received an intimation that the High Court had directed them to maintain status quo till Monday.

“The matter will come up before the court on Monday. We will wait for the court’s directions for further action,” he added.

According to Mr. Ramakrishna, the builder allegedly took individual plan sanctions for buildings on two sites, but in order to cut down on setback and increase the floor area, he joined the buildings and constructed a structure with 25 flats. “He did not get the requisite permission but many of the flats were sold in 2015-16,” Mr. Ramakrishna added.

Residents were unaware of these violations.

“The builder Ravindra Babu cheated us. We paid around ₹50 lakh each for the flats. The builder did not even provide basic amenities,” alleged one resident.

“Even the banks who gave us home loans did not alert us of the violations during the verification process,” alleged another resident. “We have put all our life savings into our homes. If they are demolished, we have nowhere else to go.”

BBMP officials said that the violations came to light after an activist sought details on the building through a Right to Information (RTI) application. He later went to court.

Several affected families have approached the police with a cheating complaint against the builder and site owner.

“The duo are said to be absconding and have not responded to notices issued by the BBMP informing them of the demolition. “We intimated residents as per provisions of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976,” said Mr. Ramakrishna.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/x7hi5h/article30823906.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGBUILDINGDEMOLITION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/residents-stall-demolition-of-illegal-building/article30823907.ece

350,2020/02/14,Roads high on BBMP’s wish list for State budget,"The priority is repairing roads that had been dug up for laying water and sewage pipelines

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has sought a grant of ₹2,300 crore in the state budget to re-do over 3,000 km of roads dug up by the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) while laying water pipelines in 110 villages. The condition of the roads has become a nightmare for residents and motorists who have been living with dust and traffic snarls for the past several months.

“BWSSB has dug up over 3,000 km of roads, and redoing them is a priority,” a senior civic engineer said.

However, in the pre-budget meeting with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who also holds the city portfolio, on Thursday evening, BWSSB reportedly disputed the extent of damage and claimed to have dug up only around 800 km of roads.

The civic body has ambitious plans for the city for which it needs ₹₹11,848 crore, which is marginally higher than its 2019-20 budget (₹11,648.9 crore). The wishlist, which was submitted to the Chief Minister on Thursday, largely focuses on road works apart from lakes and parks.

However, the civic body seems to have got a reality check. “The Chief Minister has asked us to prioritise projects. We are now rationalising our proposal for another meeting scheduled on February 19,” said Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar.

Sources in the civic body said the amount will be brought down to around ₹8,000 crore.

In a year when the Karnataka High Court has pulled up the civic body for bad condition of roads and potholes, the focus of the budget will remain roads, sources said.

Widening of nine roads

The BBMP wants to widen nine key stretches, including main roads of Dinnur, Hennur, Uttarahalli, Bannerghatta and Ittamadu, which has been pending for nearly a decade. The civic body has suggested that if property owners are not willing to give up land and the cost of acquisition is too high, flyovers have to be built instead of widening roads. The proposal for more flyovers is expected to draw the ire of activists.

Rail overbridges

The civic body wants to eliminate all manned railway level crossings by next year and sought funds for 11 Railway Over Bridges/Railway Under Bridges, for which it requires a grant of ₹2,680 crore. There is also a proposal to add a lane to the Sankey Tank Bund Road towards Chowdiah Memorial Hall side, to ease congestion on the stretch.

Alternatives to white-topping

Days after he took charge, the Chief Minister had cancelled the tender for the third white-topping package, which covers 300-km of roads. The BBMP now wants to develop these arterial and sub-arterial roads as per TenderSure specifications, for which they have sought ₹1,650 crore.

It also wants ₹715 crore for the rejuvenation of lakes, as it recently got custody of all of them barring Bellandur and Varthur. Developing tree parks on the lines of Cubbon Park at a cost of ₹300 crore in all outer zones is also part of the plan.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/6r2lr8/article30823432.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGPOLICEROADPIPELAYINGWORK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/roads-high-on-bbmps-wish-list-for-state-budget/article30823435.ece
351,2020/02/14,Consulting firms lead recruitment at IIMB,"Made 147 offers; overall, 428 students got 518 offers

It’s placement season and consulting firms seem to be the ones on a hiring spree. A majority of students from the Indian Institute of Management-Bangalore (IIMB), who graduate in 2020, have been offered jobs in consultancies.

A press release issued by IIMB stated that as many as 428 students got 518 offers. The students were part of the class of 2018-20, and took part in the lateral and final placements spread over three interview days. Consulting companies made 147 offers.

Despite the economic downturn, placements appear to have increased when compared to last year. Professor U. Dinesh Kumar, Chair, Career Development Services, IIMB, said, “Prominent domestic and international recruiters participated in the final placements, which resulted in premium jobs for students. There was a 6.14% increase in the total number of jobs offered compared to the previous year.”

Last year, as many as 411 students bagged 488 job offers.

An IIMB official pointed out that there has been no impact of the economic slowdown on the placements.

Several prominent recruiters in the information technology and IT product management domain also participated in the campus placements and made 38 offers. According to the release, there were 42 offers overall in the finance domain while conglomerates recruited for their leadership tracks making 60 offers in general management positions.

Students opting for sales and marketing roles received 55 offers and were recruited by major consumer goods firms. Several students also grabbed jobs, which had operations roles.

Anushree Jibhakate, Placement Representative, in the release stated: “IIMB has seen an increase in domestic and international offers across sectors such as Consulting, Finance, General Management, Product Management, E-commerce, Operations, Analytics and Marketing despite market conditions. Strategy Consulting and Product Management continue to be the most sought-after roles followed by Finance and General Management.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ds0y0t/article30823420.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGIIMBANGALORE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/consulting-firms-lead-recruitment-at-iimb/article30823422.ece
352,2020/02/14,Makeover of 35 junctions on the cards,"BBMP to finalise design soon, say senior officials

As many as 35 busy junctions are set to get a makeover. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has identified the junctions that not only see traffic but also those that have heavy pedestrian movement. BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar made the announcement on Friday on Twitter.

Senior officials admitted to The Hindu that a majority of the junctions were unscientifically designed and with no aesthetic quality. “The city's aesthetic appeal will increase with junction improvement. For instance, after the SBI junction was improved during the TenderSURE work on St. Mark's Road, the entire stretch was transformed,” an official said.

The BBMP will first take up geometric corrections for free vehicular movement followed by improvements in lighting, kerb design, and beautification of traffic islands. The official said that they had consulted architects for the design.

“One design for Chalukya Circle, also known as Basaveshwara Circle, is ready. The design was made free of cost for the BBMP. However, we have not finalised any design yet,” the official added.

Junction improvement is one of many projects on the BBMP’s wishlist submitted to the State government ahead of the budget.

Officials admitted that though this project is mentioned, the total cost is yet to be formulated. “We will be able to get an idea of the funds required only after a design has been finalised. As of now, we estimate that it may take at least ₹5 crore to take up improvement in any one junction,” an official said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/t2gdas/article30823336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGBASAVESHWARACIRCLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/makeover-of-35-junctions-on-the-cards/article30823338.ece
353,2020/02/14,QR code scam: Gang that cheated more than 200 persons arrested,"They are from Rajasthan

The cyber crime police have arrested five men, who hail from Rajasthan, for allegedly cheating over 200 people using QR codes over the past one year.

“This is the same gang that downloaded a picture of Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao and used it as a DP to cheat one victim,” said the police.

The kingpin, Jamil Khan, 42, is a resident of Bharatpur. He is named in eight criminal cases. One of the other accused is Haris Mohammed Saleem, 21, a former employee of a private bank and an e-wallet firm. “He has expertise in QR codes and how to use them. He too hails from Bharatpur,” said the police.

Another member of the gang, Karan Singh, 35, provided the bank account for the money to be transferred while two others — Akram Khan, 35, and Mehzair, 20 — would approach persons who had put up items for sale on online platforms.

“Akram and Mehzair used to chat with people and finalise the deal. They would share the phone number of the seller with Haris who would send a QR code. The potential victim would be asked to scan the code to get his money. But when they did that, they found that money would disappear from their accounts instead,” said a police officer.

The gang is suspected of duping over 200 people. The cyber crime police formed a special team and tracked down Karan Singh in Rajasthan. Based on information provided by him, the other gang members were arrested.

Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao praised the cyber crime police for cracking the case and announced a reward.

354,2020/02/14,Passenger says he was not allowed to carry packed fish into metro station in Bengaluru,"BMRCL says all kinds of meat are prohibited

A metro passenger took to social media on Thursday to complain after Namma Metro security personnel prevented him from carrying fish inside the metro station.

In his tweet, the passenger Pavan Kumar said, “I bought fish and was going home. But I was stopped at the metro entrance. Why is non-veg food banned in the metro? What is so wrong about carrying fish back home in the metro? I was never this embarrassed, it is a non-religious place, why this partiality?”

In its response to the post, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) said that all kinds of meat was prohibited. “However, if it’s properly packed and nothing is oozing out from the pack material and not emitting any foul smell, it is permitted,” the corporation said.

The incident and the BMRLC’s stand have sparked debate, especially after Mr. Kumar replied that he was denied permission to carry the fish even though it was properly sealed and packed.

Activist Leo Saldhanha in his tweet said, “Come on, Mosaranna (curd rice) also stinks. Now you are going to target people by what they eat. Stop targeting people by what they eat.”

355,2020/02/14,Overseas tours for students of State-run medical colleges,"Government plans to kickstart exchange programmes from the 2020-21 academic year

Medical students in State-run colleges will soon be able to go to universities and medical colleges in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Australia on exchange programmes. The State government plans to kickstart these exchange programmes from the 2020-21 academic year.

Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar told The Hindu that the government is in the process of finalising some of the modalities and deliberating about who would bear the cost of this programme. “We have chosen these three countries as they have some renowned medical schools and also language would not be a barrier. Some institutions, like King's College and Imperial College in London, have already invited me to visit their colleges as I have been part of charity associations. We will work with institutions that are known for the quality of education they impart,” said Mr. Sudhakar.

The aim is to help medical students here broaden their horizons, get first-hand experience of advancements in technology and equipment. “Students from our State, who go on these programmes, will also get to study the health policies and visit some of the top hospitals in the host country,” he added.

As part of the exchange programme, students from participating colleges abroad will come to Karnataka and study in medical colleges here.

Training for NEET

The government is keen on improving the performance of students in the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET).

To achieve this, students from Karnataka will be trained for the competitive exam next year.

“We want more Kannadigas and students from the State to get top ranks in NEET so that they are able to bag seats in medical colleges,” he said.

Medical or dental seat aspirants will be able to avail of this training programme that will be conducted over the weekends in 17 government-run medical colleges.

“Recordings of some of the best professors will be screened. Students will get insights and strategies on how to prepare for the NEET,” said Mr. Sudhakar.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/h6c26g/article30814450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13Bgdoctorscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/overseas-tours-for-students-of-state-run-medical-colleges/article30814452.ece
356,2020/02/14,"Bharat Gupt: ‘Language is only an attribute, not one’s sole identity’","Author, academician Bharat Gupt discusses how his love for culture and traditions was shaped in his childhood

Bharat Gupt, an academician by qualification, is one of the finest cultural analysts in the country. His experience in documenting the vastness of the country’s cultural roots as a classicist, a theatre theorist through columns, books, lectures and workshops and now a YouTube channel makes him an important figure at a time when newer perspectives on ancient literature are emerging by the day.

Besides being the founding member of the International Forum for India’s Heritage, the 73-year-old has drawn parallels of Greek drama with Indian works. An active promoter of Sanskrit and the value it lends to the education system, he was in Hyderabad for a two-day workshop on ‘Arts, Aesthetics, and Morality in Classical and Modern Times - with reference to texts like Natya Shastra, Kama Shastra, Dharma Shastra and more.’

Even as a child, the Moradabad-born woke up to his father’s chants of the Goswami Tulsidas’ Ram Charit Manas, learnt about the classic texts in Sanskrit literature, developed a taste for Urdu poetry as well as Hindustani music, all before he turned 15. He knew to play the sitar and surbahar too. “I grew up in a family where these things were practised as an everyday activity. My dad had adored Tulsidas and I knew that Ramayan by heart by seven. My house was steeped in Indian tradition. I didn’t have to go through regular Anglophonic education and discover the vastness of Indian culture later. Hindustani music, a dose of Urdu poetry, epic Sanskrit texts were integral elements of childhood,” he reminisces.

Having actively read Tagore and Shakespeare (whose works he had finished reading before turning 16), had enriched him early in life. “I was impervious to any propaganda; later my stint at the University of Toronto, being guided by the likes of Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan, literary critic Northrop Frye was the icing on the cake,” the veteran shares.

While he had every chance to either be a theatre person or a musician, it was the academician in him that came to the fore. “The desire to analyse and place things in order had a longer strain in me. I am more given to analysis, classification and experiencing art to the fullest. I looked upon it as a darshan, trying to understand it intellectually and be a shastrakaar (who comments, interprets art, literature),” Gupt adds.

Patronage of Sanskrit

Discussing the challenges in keeping the legacy of Sanskrit alive in the mainstream space and the reasons behind the same, he informs, “This happened when Sanskrit was no longer the language of the ruling class, where it lost its status to reach out to everybody. People say Sanskrit has lost its hegemony. I would like to say, Sanskrit wasn’t about hegemony; the language wasn’t imposed on people. India as a nation never thinks that one language is superior to the other. Sanskrit writers were equally fond of Prakrit too. Most plays of Kalidas was less about Sanskrit and more about Prakrit.”

Despite the extensive literature being produced in Sanskrit today, he rues that it doesn’t pass through global literary honours. “Second-rate writing has been projected and honoured at a national level and has been pushed at the international level as the soul of modern India. The poetry, translation and short-story writing in Sanskrit has been as vast in the recent past mostly in the rural side of the country, despite practically zero patronage from the State,” Gupt adds.

Is marketing one’s work the issue? “Market isn’t what always drives the creative side of literature. It may sell for a short while. Say, The God of Small Things may have been translated in over 20 languages, but how much has it influenced other literature in the country? What’s valuable in literature is recognised over 100 years,” he states. It pains him to think that language in political terms is associated with a State, a particular politician, while its association with other languages of the country is ignored.

Changing perceptions

Even in several South Indian states where Hindi imposition is being opposed, Gupt feels that the people fail to look at the larger picture. “Hindi imposition is stringently opposed in Tamil Nadu, but are the same lot translating Tamil literature into other languages so that it reaches wider quarters? Are efforts being made to translate great works in other languages into Tamil? It’s the case with every other Indian language and region. That’s where the great devastation is taking place,” he informs. The academician rues that language wasn’t an identity of an Indian in the past, it was only one among the many attributes he had.

This is also an age where there has been significant opposition to history being rewritten to suit religious propaganda, but Gupt prefers to look at it from a different lens. “The accuracy of history needs to be re-examined from time to time and the masses are beginning to re-evaluate the lens through which it was documented in the past. This has become very uncomfortable for those academics, bureaucrats, the ones in the judiciary who had taken huge entitlements in the past for it and are not ready to reconsider the new age demands. It threatens their elevated status. The call for a revision of history isn’t mischief of any political party, it’s a new wave of thought one needs to accept.”

Staying in tune with modern-day demands of learning, many have benefited out of Bharat Gupt’s workshops on a vast range of texts including the Natyashastra, Manusmriti, Kamasutra and Dharmashastra to name a few. He finds it extremely rewarding to interact with the younger lot from time to time. “The task is first to introduce them to a subject at a preliminary level. I give them essential ideas, the total picture of the text. It’s also an attempt to free them away from delusions they have about history, that the texts have to conform to their belief system. But I’m happy that the young blood in the country is taking a genuine interest to learn, revise, question and rethink norms of our past. That is the hope for the future,” he signs off.",interview,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/interview/ghherj/article30819797.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf14bharatGuptajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/interview/friday-review-telangana/article30819798.ece

Riding on the success of the food plaza at the Thiruvanmiyur MRTS (Mass Rapid Transit System ) station opened a year ago, the railway department has opened a food court at the Velachery MRTS station.

The food court, located adjacent to the entrance of the railway station, will serve all kinds of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, and was inaugurated by P. Mahesh, Divisional Railway Manager, Chennai division, on Wednesday.

Already food plazas operated by IRCTC function at Thiruvanmiyur, Taramani and Thirumayilai railway stations. While two fast food joints are open on the ground floor of the Thirumayilai station, food plazas are near the platform of the Thiruvanmiyur and Taramani stations.

T. Naresh Kumar, a regular commuter, said the food court at the Velachery railway station has come at the right time, as there are no proper food joints nearby after encroaching shops and restaurants were removed last year. Thousands of commuters visiting the railway station faced hardships as the station was far from Velachery Main Road, he pointed out.

As the MRTS railway stations have lots of space, regular commuters insist on the need to open food plazas at Chepauk, Mandaveli, Indira Nagar and Kotturpuram railway stations as well.

“Work is on to open two more food plazas on the Tambaram- Chennai Beach stretch in Mambalam and Pallavaram railway stations,” said a senior railway official.

362,2020/02/14,"In Chennai, this intersection has had no working traffic signal for years","The Royapettah High Road junction is perennially chaotic with thousands of vehicles using it, but with the traffic light not working, there are constant snarls

Chaos prevail on Royapettah High Road junction during peak hours every day, as the road is narrow and the traffic signal on this important stretch has not been working for years.

Royapettah Government Hospital, schools and the Provident Fund office are located on Royapettah High Road. Thousands of motorists use this stretch. But since the signal does not work, vehicles do not wait for others to pass by and due to this, traffic snarls are common during peak hours. Ambulances that go to Royapettah Government Hospital too get caught in the traffic sometimes.

“The signal does not work on regular days, but when some VIP uses this stretch, it suddenly starts functioning. The next day only the amber light keeps blinking,” said Rasool Ahmed, a resident of Royapettah High Road.

Local residents also complain that accidents have taken place due to the lack of signals. “My wife is frightened to ride through this junction. Buses, bikes and cars ply through this junction at high speed during non-peak hours,” said K. Vijay, a medical representative who uses the stretch frequently.

Residents and motorists also complain that there are no policemen at this junction to regulate traffic. “This signal is few feet away from the Royapettah police station. It is surprising to see the negligence,” said Mr. Ahmed.

The residents want the Chennai traffic police to address the issue at the earliest. “At present, it is free for all. They should make the signal work and also deploy policemen at the junction. It is not enough if they collect fines for not wearing helmets, they should ensure safety of motorists by having adequate working signals,” said Mr. Vijay.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mgk1te/article30820461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14FEBTH-ROYAPETTAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/in-chennai-this-intersection-has-had-no-working-traffic-signal-for-years/article30820462.ece
363,2020/02/14,‘Loans used to pay interests of State’,"Ahead of the State Budget, DMK MLA PTR Palanivel Thiagarajan on Thursday alleged that Tamil Nadu’s debt has crossed ₹ 4-lakh crore and the money borrowed by the government was being used only to pay the interest for the loan.

Talking to reporters in Chennai, he said the loan amount was not used for investment.

When the tenure of the DMK regime ended in mid-2011, the interest paid per annum was ₹ 8,000 crore. “It increased to ₹ 18,000 crore when Jayalalithaa was the Chief Minister. But in the last year the AIADMK government paid ₹ 29,000 crore as interest,” he said

Mr. Thiagarajan said what was lacking today was the fiscal management and the biggest problem ailing the state economy was stunted revenue growth.

“When economy witness growth, the revenue also should match it. Only such a growth will result in investment and implementation of welfare schemes. But the State is not witnessing growth since 2016,” he said.

Recalling the suggestion made in the CAG report that a committee should be formed to increase revenue, Mr. Thiagarajan said the revenue should be increased to 10% of the total production.

He said the revenue deficit stood at ₹ 23,500 crore and it was unprecedented in the fiscal history of Tamil Nadu.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/loans-used-to-pay-interests-of-state/article30814951.ece

While no one has come anywhere close to Mr. Panneerselvam’s record as far as the last 20 years are concerned, he is still behind three others, if one takes into account the presentation of State Budgets since 1952.

In March 1976, the former, who had by then become the Union Finance Minister, got a rare opportunity to submit the State Budget in Parliament, as Tamil Nadu was under the President’s rule following the dissolution of the Assembly two months earlier.

At 3.30 p.m. on Thursday, the skies came alive with music. Taking inspiration from the subject of their movie, the team of Soorarai Pottru released Veyyon silli, the first song from the film, mid-air, aboard a SpiceJet Boeing 737 flight, in a first-of-its-kind event.

The flight was a special one for more than one reason. Among the passengers, comprising the team behind the film and journalists, were also 70 children from the Agaram Foundation, who were given the opportunity to go on a flight for the first time.

“We chose students from government schools across the State, based on an essay writing competition. We had asked them about what they would do if they were given a chance to travel on a plane and many had written that they would like for their parents or siblings to have that opportunity instead,” said actor Suriya, about the heart-warming responses they received.

“Whatever inventions are introduced, they are meaningless if they not made affordable and accessible. In 2000, less than 1% of the population was able to fly. Captain Gopinath changed the whole industry and took the common man to the skies,” said the actor, speaking about the film. Stating that Captain Gopinath had revolutionised the aviation industry, Suriya said that the film was a tribute to him and heaped praises on director Sudha Kongara, for her vision and decade-long work on the project. Soorarai Pottru is based on the life of Captain G.R. Gopinath who founded Air Deccan.

Ajay Singh, chairman of SpiceJet, who released the song, said that they were happy to partner with the film, as its theme resonated with their vision of making every Indian fly.

“Suriya promised me creative freedom when I worked on the film, and he gave me enough creative freedom which took me higher than this Boeing 737,” said Mr. Kongara. The actor had earlier said that Mr. Kongara had worked on the film for 10 years.

After the release of the song mid-air, music composer G.V. Prakash Kumar spoke about the song and said that they had chosen to incorporate folk instruments and lyrics in it, while presenting it in a stylish format. “I’m hoping that after this film, biopics become more popular in Tamil cinema,” he said. Amid cheers from the young passengers, the composer sang a few lines from the song as well.

A trip across city

For the first-time fliers, their experience was made better through announcements by the flight captain, who ensured that they got to see stunning ariel views of the Bay of Bengal, the Chennai Port and the M.A. Chinnaswamy Stadium, among other landmarks in the city.

The film is being produced by 2D entertainment and Academy Award winner Guneet Monga’s Sikhya Entertainment. Stating that this was her first Tamil film, Ms. Monga said that she cherished the experience of working on the film.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gmsb06/article30814719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Suriya-Agaram-Foundation,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/music-up-in-the-sky/article30814720.ece

371,2020/02/14,Emergency response officer removed from service for poor handling of call,"Officer was trying to ascertain if distress call was genuine

The 108 ambulance network has removed an emergency response officer (ERO) for poor handling of a call for help from a 19-year-old college student in Kancheepuram. The youth, who sought help after he developed breathlessness, died.

Officials said the emergency response centre received several prank calls and the ERO was trying to ascertain if the caller was genuinely seeking help.

The student, Ganesh Kumar, was a resident of Aladi Pillayar Koil Street, Kiraimandapam, Kancheepuram. On February 9, he had gone for a walk in a nearby school ground in the evening. Around 4.15 p.m., he is suspected to have suffered breathlessness and called the 108 emergency response centre. A telephonic conversation reportedly between Ganesh and the ERO was widely circulated on message sharing platform. Gasping for breath, Ganesh is heard pleading for help and asking for a vehicle to be sent to the school ground. The ERO keeps asking him to give the phone to someone near him and Ganesh keeps reiterating in the audio that there is no one by his side.

Anonymous calls

According to officials of 108 ambulance service, they frequently received anonymous/nuisance calls similar to these type of calls.

In this case, the ERO was trying to ascertain if the call was genuine. The ERO was removed from service, he added.

He said employees were provided proper training on a periodical basis.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/xeza37/article30817133.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THAMBULANCEINTRAFFIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/emergency-response-officer-removed-from-service-for-poor-handling-of-call/article30814685.ece

373,2020/02/14,Commandos will make Marina beach safer,"Apart from rescue training, they will be trained in deep sea diving and identifying rip currents

Marina beach is expected to become safer soon with fifty commandos from the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services (TNFRS) undergoing various kinds of underwater training to rescue people from getting dragged into the sea.

From scuba diving to surf board rescues and rock climbing, the commandos who are expected to be posted in the newly formed Marina TNFRS station in Triplicane, are undergoing training in various aspects of rescue mission.

“We provided a 18-day scuba diving training for the commandos and there are beach workouts daily to improve stamina and endurance. We also provided deep sea diving training to rescue people. It was a unique experience for most of the personnel who have been till date fighting fire,” said a TNFRS officer.

Besides, the personnel have also been trained to ride the all-terrain vehicles and water-ski scooters. “The main focus is to improve the swimming skills of commandos so that they can unhesitatingly jump into the water and rescue stranded swimmers,” the officer said.

There are plans to install watch towers along the Marina beach and the personnel will man them on a shift basis. To ensure high visibility, the commandos will sport fluorescent uniforms.

Apart from the rescue training, the commandos will also be trained in identifying rip currents. “Once they are deployed, we will have to check the tides frequently. We have to identify the spots where visitors can stand in the water and have fun safely,” said another officer.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/xoiop2/article30814677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THMARINACOMMANDOS-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/commandos-will-make-marina-beach-safer/article30814678.ece
374,2020/02/14,Crowdfunding helps 100 patients in city,"34,000 contribute ₹5 cr. to fund surgeries, including liver transplants for children

In 15 months, over ₹5 crore was raised through a crowdfunding platform to support the treatment of nearly 100 patients at a city hospital. A total of 34,000 donors contributed ₹5 crore to fund surgeries, including liver transplants for children.

On Thursday, the Rela Institute and Medical Centre (RIMC) and Milaap, the crowdfunding platform, presented two patients — a three-month baby who was diagnosed with a rare genetic liver disorder (Prothrombotic disorder) and an eight-year-old girl who was diagnosed with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis.

Both underwent liver transplants at RIMC; fundraisers on Milaap fetched ₹30 lakh in a day for the baby and ₹16 lakh for the girl.

Affordability has always been a question in case of liver transplants, Mohamed Rela, chairman and managing director of RIMC, said.

“In India, affordability has improved. The Tamil Nadu government provides funds for liver and bone marrow transplants, but there is no chance for it to reach everyone, as there are eligibility norms. Through a platform like Milaap, ₹5 crore was raised in 15 months, and this has benefited 100 of our paediatric and adult patients to get high-end treatment,” he told reporters. People who donated the funds have made this possible, he added.

Anoj Viswanathan, president and co-founder of Milaap, said the initiative was started 10 years ago, and had raised ₹400 crore towards medical needs of people. “We have 20 lakh donors in and outside India. Thirty percent of them have contributed more than once. Most users are from middle and lower-middle class families, who do not fit into any schemes. People use the platform when they run out of options such as insurance cover and savings,” he said.

He added that patients turned to crowdfunding for cancers, specifically blood cancers, liver transplants, paediatric and newborn intensive care, accident and trauma. He said that they were working on providing tax exemptions for donors.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/crowdfunding-helps-100-patients-in-city/article30814664.ece
375,2020/02/14,Highways dept. begins work on beautifying space beneath flyovers,"Gardens, fountains, sculptures and focus lights planned

In three months time, spaces beneath flyovers at Chromepet, Tambaram, Meenambakkam and Pallavaram will have lush green gardens. The Highways Department has begun work to beautify the spaces beneath these facilities at a total cost of ₹5 crore.

“Since there is open space beneath flyovers, people tend to dump stuff including garbage and even building debris. People also misuse the space by spitting. The effort is to prevent this and also pasting of posters on pillars and defacing the walls. The pillars would have vertical gardens with individual drop irrigation facility to water the plants. These are not just efforts to beautify spaces, we hope these works would discourage people from misusing them,” explained a source in the Highways Department.

The space beneath the flyovers would also have fountains, sculptures and focus lights. Presently, construction of short walls for landscaping and other structures are going on. The works are expected to be completed in three months time.

The contractor would have to maintain the gardens, lights and other structures for five years. Works including installation of borewells and sumps, at flyovers at Moolakadai, Poonamallee High Road at Nelson Manickam Road, Thirumangalam flyover too would commence within 10-15 days.

Under the CRIDP package, a total of 120 wards are to be taken at a total cost of ₹160 crore. These include construction of stormwater drains, widening of the Medavakkam-Mambakkam-Sembakkam Road from end-to-end using available land.

‘Maintain properly’

Besant Nagar resident G. Ramakrishnan said that such green islands were welcome on city roads but care must be taken to maintain them properly. “We have cattle roaming around freely on roads. Also people tend to break public property like granite slabs and covers of drains. CCTV cameras and security should also be provided so that these spaces remain the pride of the city,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mfw4q5/article30814662.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THFLYOVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/highways-dept-begins-work-on-beautifying-space-beneath-flyovers/article30814663.ece
376,2020/02/14,Governor’s signature not necessary to release me: Nalini,"‘Advice by council of ministers enough to let out of prison’

S. Nalini, 52, one of the seven convicts in former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, has contended before the Madras High Court that signature of the Governor was not mandatory for releasing them and that the advice given by council of ministers to him on September 9, 2018, was sufficient to let them out of prison.

Arguing her habeas corpus petition before a Justices R. Subbiah and R. Pongiappan, the petitioner’s counsel M. Radhakrishnan recalled that a five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the famous Maru Ramu’s case (1980) had held that consent of the Governor was just a “constitutional courtesy” and nothing more.

‘Detention illegal’

Further, referring to the Supreme Court’s recent insistence that the Governor could not sit over mercy pleas for long and that a decision must be taken within a reasonable time, the counsel argued that Nalini’s detention since September 10, 2018 should be considered illegal since the Governor had not taken any decision on the State Cabinet’s advice.

After hearing him, the judges directed State Public Prosecutor A. Natarajan to get instructions from the Home department by February 18 on the legal points canvassed by the petitioner’s counsel and make his submissions on the specific plea that every day of detention after September 9, 2018 should necessarily be considered as illegal.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/governors-signature-not-necessary-to-release-me-nalini/article30814640.ece

378,2020/02/14,Corpn. to demolish conventional cremation sheds,"Residents of added areas refuse to use modern methods for cremation

The Chennai Corporation has started work on demolishing conventional cremation sheds to prevent pollution in residential areas and avoid conflict between communities in the city.

The city continues to have conventional cremation sheds in 150 burial grounds.

Many residents have reportedly been demanding the conventional method, refusing to use technologies such as gasifier for cremation. Residents have staged protests in many added areas such as Sholinganallur, Manali, Madhavaram and Tiruvottiyur, officials said.

Following a dispute, the Corporation Council had passed a resolution to demolish a conventional cremation shed in ward 196 of the Sholinganallur zone.

Many residents of areas such as Injambakkam, Vettuvankeni, Akkarai, Sholinganallur, Panaiyur and Utthandi have been using the facility, causing pollution in residential areas. The Injambakkam panchayat had constructed a conventional cremation shed in 2006. After the merger of the panchayat with the city, the Corporation developed a gasifier in the 5.43-acre burial ground in 2016. But most residents continue to use the conventional cremation shed.

Now civic officials have requested residents to report pollution caused in residential areas by conventional cremation sheds. “Residents can call helpline 1913 to report pollution by conventional cremation sheds,” said an official. However, a few residents said the Corporation should also have alternatives such as conventional facilities to cope with emergency situations, when modern technology fails. The Corporation has also been modernising cremation facilities with support from NGOs. But cooperation from residents in added areas for using modern technology for cremation remains a challenge, officials said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corpn-to-demolish-conventional-cremation-sheds/article30814625.ece
379,2020/02/14,COVID-19: Chennai Port bans entry of crew from three countries,"Ships from vulnerable ports also prohibited from dumping garbage

The Chennai Port has advised all agencies in the city to ban the entry of crew on board ships from China, including Hong Kong and Macau, Thailand and Singapore into India by stopping the issue of landing permit or shore leave pass. The ships, considered vulnerable to the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), were also prohibited from dumping their garbage.

“We have decided to temporarily prevent the entry of crew members on board ships from three countries, irrespective of their nationalities or health conditions. The ships will not be permitted to dump their garbage here. The decision is part of the standard operating procedure (SOP) devised after the World Health Organisation declared the spread of the virus a public health emergency,” Chennai Port Trust chairman P. Raveendran told The Hindu on Thursday.

P. Raveendran

Besides checking the countries visited by the ships, health officials have been closely monitoring the health condition of the crew of all ships calling at the Chennai Port. Masters of Captains have been sharing the health condition of the crew via email, on a daily basis, as the ship approaches the Indian coast. Where there was any suspicion on any member of the crew suffering from fever, throat infection or other symptoms of COVID-19, his/her visuals were called for via email.

Mr. Raveendran said that a special team, headed by chief medical officer Raja Ravi Varma and port health officer Senthilnathan, was screening the crew of incoming ships, with more focus on those originating from the three countries considered risky. Adequate numbers of N-95 face masks, personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, thermal scanners and gloves were procured for all front-line staff and health officials to deal with the threat of COVID-19.

Stakeholder

“The SOP was chalked out by consulting all stakeholders, and roles/responsibilities of other agencies like the Customs, Immigration, Coast Guard and Navy, were clearly defined. An isolation ward has been created at the Port Hospital to quarantine suspected COVID-19-affected patients and an ambulance positioned on the premises round-the-clock. We have screened 10 ships and 194 crew members at Chennai and Ennore ports,” he said.

Mr. Raveendran said that the COVID-19 issue had not affected normal business of import/export. No ship was turned away because of its origin from the five countries and health officials so far have not reported any case of suspected COVID-19.

“This virus can spread only though humans and not by any material. There is no need for any concern even if a container originating from China is unloaded here. But any ship, strongly suspected, will not be allowed to berth,” said Dr. Senthilnathan, who also supervises COVID-19 checks at non-major ports in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/uho8v0/article29970271.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14NOVCHENNAIPORTNET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/port-bans-entry-of-ship-crew-from-three-countries/article30814624.ece
380,2020/02/14,QR code scams on the rise,"In the last 10 days, police have received 20 complaints

With the explosion of smartphones and multiple modes of payment through apps on the rise, scamsters have found innovative methods to trick gullible consumers. The latest one is faking the popular Quick Response (QR) Codes to extract money fraudulently.

A software engineer in Thiruvanmiyur placed an advertisement to sell his washing machine. He was approached by a person posing as a buyer who offered ₹16,000.

After negotiating for a few minutes, the caller told him that he would send the cash online and asked him to scan a QR code, which he would send through WhatsApp. As soon as the QR code was scanned and the specified procedures followed, a sum of ₹32,000 was withdrawn from his account. Then the caller switched off his mobile phone and was unreachable thereafter.

In last 10 days, at least 20 complaints on QR Code scam were reported to the Cyber Crime Unit of Chennai City Police. A senior police officer of the special unit said, “Of late, we are receiving many complaints from people who lost their money within seconds to unknown criminals. Here fraudsters share the QR code over WhatsApp asking for the code to be scanned to receive money in their account. The victims fall prey to the fraudsters after they scan the code.”

“Fraudsters also ask users to install screen sharing applications such as Teamviewer and Any Desk on the pretext of sending prize money. As soon as the users installed such apps, fraudsters gain access to their bank credentials,” said the police officer.

Sankarraj Subramanian, a cyber expert said, “When the victim tries to access QR code for payment, it takes him to a fake payment gateway page, where victim needs to enter his card details. Once that is done, attacker will have access to victim’s crucial information stored in a mobile phone.”

The apps and codes contain Trojan horses, or malware, which allows the hacker to gain access to financial information that is stored on the phone.

Police also said no case of fraud was reported from shopkeepers who use QR code system for sale or from customers who directly purchase from any outlet using QR code.

Such cases were reported in other countries, where criminals generated QR code stickers through fake IDs and cellphone numbers. Then they went around shops or outlets replacing the original QR codes with their stickers and swindled money without the knowledge of the business owners, police claimed.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lysu9e/article30817116.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THQRCODE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/qr-code-scams-on-the-rise/article30814603.ece
381,2020/02/14,Watch out! Spitting in public places too can spread infections,"Health officials call for best hygiene practices

If there is something that people get to hear very often when airborne diseases pose a threat, it is the advice on coughing/sneezing hygiene and frequent handwashing. There is something else that gets very little or no emphasis — avoiding spitting in public. Like cough, spitting too, according to doctors and public health officials, can lead to spread of infections.

In a city like Chennai, people spitting on roads continues to be a common sight. Doctors and public health officials say that many spit on the road while travelling by two-wheelers, cars or buses, with no second thought about others on the road.

When respiratory infectious diseases such as H1N1 influenza peaks in the State, and now, with the outbreak of the coronavirus disease in China, the emphasis is largely on cough etiquette and hand hygiene. Spitting is most often the last thing to be emphasised.

This, despite Tamil Nadu having a legislation that prohibits spitting — The Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Smoking and Spitting Act, 2002. The Act prohibits both smoking and spitting in places of public work or use and public service vehicles, mandates display of boards pinpointing that both are offences, and are punishable with fine.

With the enforcement of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, this Act took the back seat, and along with it went the prohibition on spitting, a public health official said.

Spitting in a public place indicates both lack of civic sense and poor awareness on hygiene practices. “Of course, a lot has changed in the last 10-20 years, but people continue to spit in public. People should be made to feel that spitting does not reflect good on them. From a health perspective, spitting can spread infectious agents to others,” a senior doctor of the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital said.

Like cough and sneeze, droplets from the spit of an infected person can transmit infections to others, especially under favourable conditions, doctors said.

Leading by example

There are instances where places have been declared spit-free. T. Jacob John, retired professor of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, who was instrumental in making the college and the hospital campuses spit-free zones, said, “It has been taught in various classes that Singapore and the U.K. banned spitting because of the high prevalence of tuberculosis. If everybody stops spitting, it will influence or force a person with TB to stop spitting. Spit-free is not about aesthetic cleanliness but also about public health,” he said.

“Covering the mouth while coughing, covering the nose while sneezing and not spitting are three important hygiene practices. It is necessary to control the spread of respiratory-transmitted infections such as TB, influenza, common cold, pneumonia-causing viruses such as SARS and also the present coronavirus,” he added.

The institution put up signboards on campuses and buildings in Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and English. “All security staff are trained to gently tell a person, who spits, to look at the signboards. Prior to the campaign, people would spit on the campus, especially at the building corners,” he added. Officials said that this required a behavioural change, and awareness should begin at school level.

A senior health official said that enforcement, by way of imposing a fine, was one of the ways through which spitting in public places could be prevented.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wznjc6/article30814577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THISOLATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/watch-out-spitting-in-public-places-too-can-spread-infections/article30814578.ece
382,2020/02/14,Towards a new world order,"Effective safety nets; free education and healthcare; and high taxes on the rich need to form part of the system

The World Economic Forum (WEF), held at Davos last month, has become a Mecca for all forms of new capitalism. It started in 1971 with the noble objective of improving the state of the world, but now serves as a platform for world leaders, billionaires, professionals at the top of the business pyramid, senior government ministerial delegations, and others, who gather to change the world. This is the 49th year of the congregation, which now resembles an ice circus. The messages from Davos drift like snowflakes, on the agendas of the developed world.

If you tear aside the screen that covers all the events at the conference, you could be staring at some of the world’s most complex and intractable problems, with no end in sight. All the issues can be condensed into just one, relating to survival of the planet itself.

Social inequalities and the grim problems of stark and continuing poverty are at the epicentre of the new world. The latest Oxfam Report presented at Davos points out that 2,153 billionaires have more wealth than 4.6 billion people. The emergence of billionaires and oligarchs in different parts of the world coincides with increased poverty among the already poor people, especially children. These realities make observers question the tenability of stakeholder capitalism as a concept.

The ugliest face of this capitalism was visible during the 2007-2008 economic crisis, first in the U.S. and thereafter across the European Union. At that time, it appeared as if the global economy was on the verge of collapse.

One of the chief characteristics of economic development is the intensification of energy use. There is an unprecedented concentration of high energy density in all economic development strategies. The bulk of the energy continues to be generated from non-renewable sources. The developed world’s, and China’s, central objective is to capture energy-generating resources from across continents and put them to use to push GDP growth to greater heights. In the process, sustainability is becoming a casualty.

How do we define energy? In physics, energy is defined as ‘work done’ or, in other words, the force that moves all objects. It is important to understand the philosophical implications of one of the great laws of physics — the Laws of Thermodynamics. The first law states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it merely changes form and is always conserved. The second law states that when ‘work is done’, only a part of the energy is consumed, the balance is lost. The lost part is called ‘entropy’ and it is proven that entropy always maximises. This whole phenomenon also leaves behind inert material as waste. The higher the use of energy, the larger the amount of waste generated. Entropy, like time, is always unidirectional, it only goes forward.

Excess consumption

Egregious consumption of energy by the developed world has been accompanied by the disposal of residual products (‘e-waste’) on the shores of many African and Asian countries. As a result, the poor in the developing world are, unwittingly, drawn and exposed to toxic, hazardous materials like lead, cadmium and arsenic. Hence, the ‘globalisation’ phenomenon has turned out to be nothing other than exploitation of the developing world, with most countries being treated as a source of cheap labour and critical raw material.

Most, if not all, transactions are based on the arbitrage between price and value difference, from which only the ‘middleman’ gains, not the primary producer. Countries in the developed world, and China, are ferociously using up finite raw materials without care or concern for the welfare of present and future generations. Certainly, there has been significant technological progress which has brought about revolution in the fields of healthcare and communications, but there is also a dark side to this. High expenses and Intellectual Property Rights load the system further in favour of the rich. To demonstrate how deep the rot is, one can look at the pernicious plan to set up a carbon credit system. Under this, countries with high energy consumption trends can simply offset their consumption patterns by purchasing carbon credits, the unutilised carbon footprint, from poor developing countries.

To sum up, these are tough issues and solutions are not easily available. We will, however, do well to probe and understand the ‘Nordic Economic Model’, which pertains to the remarkable achievements of the Scandinavian countries comprising Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, Norway, and allied territories. The total population of the Nordic countries is estimated at almost 27 million people. These nations are among the richest in the world when measured in terms of GDP per capita. They also have large public sector enterprises; extensive and generous universal welfare systems; high levels of taxation; and considerable state involvement in promoting and upholding welfare states. UN reports also indicate that the Nordic countries are the happiest countries in the world. The U.S., in contrast, is in 19th place.

Taking the Nordic model as a template, there are some ingredients that could be part of a new ‘enlightened global order’. These should include — effective welfare safety nets for all; corruption-free governance; a fundamental right to tuition-free education, including higher education; and a fundamental right to good medical care. This also has to involve shutting of tax havens. In Nordic countries, personal and corporate income tax rates are very high, especially on the very rich. If a just, new world order is to arise, taxes everywhere should go up.

Holding companies responsible

When it comes to the corporate sector, there are some new perspectives. In traditional business accounting, ‘bottom line’ refers to the financial year’s profit or loss earned or incurred by the company on pure financial parameters. However, following vigorous debates, a new format has emerged under which a company’s performance is measured through four ‘Ps’. The first is ‘P’ for ‘profit’. The second ‘P’ is for people — how the company’s actions impact not only employees, but society as a whole. The third ‘P’ is for planet — are the company’s actions and plans sensitive to the environment? The four ‘P’ is for purpose, which means the companies and individuals must develop a larger purpose than ‘business as usual’. They must ask: what is the larger purpose of the company, apart from generating profits? Using big data and text analytics, a company’s performance can be measured in terms of all the four ‘P’s and a corporate entity can be thus held accountable. Market capitalisation need not be the only way to measure the value of a company.

I recognise that much work is yet to be done to uplift the global economic order, but the important point is that new tools are now emerging. What is required is a global consensus and the will to make the planet more sustainable, so that all individuals can live with justice and equality, ensuring that not a single child is hungry or seriously unwell because of poverty or lack of affordable medical help.

383,2020/02/14,On Trump visit,"Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump sustain their popularity by representing the interests of certain constituencies in their respective countries. They resemble each other so much that in a jocular vein Trump can be called ‘America’s Modi’ and Modi ‘India’s Trump’ (Editorial, “Birds of a feather,” Feb. 13).

Mr. Trump’s unguarded revelation that Modi promised an attendance of 5 to 7 million people in Gujarat to cheer him gave a clear indication that that kem chho event is going to be more simulated than spontaneous. A lot of work and money will have to be put into mobilising crowds to accord the visiting dignitary a ‘memorable welcome’. Supporters of Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump are sure to get a vicarious thrill out of watching the leaders lap up mass adulation. The bonhomie between Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump is unlikely to work in America as much as it does in India in lifting the spirits of people. Mr. Trump is sure to use his two-day visit to India to garner the support of Indian Americans in the race for re-election as President.

Possibly the Modi-Trump summit will see the inking of trade and defence deals. As avowed nationalists, Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump cannot be seen to be not driving a hard bargain. It is doubtful that Mr. Trump will agree to undo the recent decisions made by him against India’s interests on the trade front. Still, pressure must be mounted on Mr. Trump to reinstate India in US’ list of developing countries and restore its Generalised System of Preferences toward India. Defence deals for acquisition of sea hawk helicopters and reconnaissance drones are said to be on the cards. As the arms supplier, the U.S. stands to benefit from the deals. A decrease in defence expenditure can go to increase expenditure on food security, health and education for the impoverished multitudes.

The two leaders are almost on the same page on issues involving Muslims; Mr. Modi’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act is akin to Trump’s denial of visa to Muslims from certain countries. The Trump administration does not hold the CAA and the National Register of Citizens against the Modi government, but Democrats trenchantly criticise them and that is bound to bear on India-U.S. relations.

385,2020/02/14,AAP 3.0,"The Narendra Modi-Amit Shah juggernaut was, yet again, stopped by Arvind Kejriwal. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s emphatic victory is an endorsement by Delhi voters of the political culture established by the party. The results come as a fitting acknowledgement of the political will and commitment displayed by the AAP government in fulfilling its major election promises. The government endeared itself to the electorate by providing free water, cheap electricity and door delivery of 40-odd services to citizens. The highly personalised, negative campaign targeting Mr. Kejriwal, and excessive confidence in the ‘Modi wave’ boomeranged on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Given the string of setbacks in recent State elections, it needs to groom State-level leaders and focus on local issues rather than relying solely on the charisma of the Prime Minister. The complete wipe-out of the Congress Party added insult to injury for a party that is in a state of free fall and struggling to recuperate from the drubbing received during the general elections. To sum up, the message of the electorate was loud and clear — their priority continues to be bread and butter issues.

B. Suresh Kumar,

Coimbatore

That the voter has cast his valuable vote for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)’s good work for the poor and the underprivileged is definitely a positive sign for electoral democracy. It will encourage leaders to think that sincerity will pay. Mr. Kejriwal’s victory speech brings to my mind Jawaharlal Nehru’s words, “I stand before you not as your first Prime Minister but as your first servant.” That people have thought beyond divisive agenda, which is disastrous to constitutional polity, is a positive feature of this election.

N.G.R. Prasad,

Chennai

All the efforts of the BJP to upset the apple cart of Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party have come to nought and the Delhi voter has overwhelmingly exercised his and her franchise in favour of AAP, ensuring a fresh term in office for Mr. Kejriwal. The Congress, in no position to challenge either AAP or the BJP, has not been able to win a single seat though it made bold to field candidates in as many as 67 of the 70 constituencies. More than 60 these candidates have even forfeited their deposits. The BJP waged a relentless battle, engaging a battery of top-notch campaigners, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and as many as 11 Union Ministers but all to no avail. All that the BJP succeeded in was in winning five more seats, as compared to the 3 seats that it won in 2015, and in increasing its vote share. The highly intemperate and vituperative campaign by some of the BJP’s star speakers, including Union Minister Anurag Thakur and MP Parvesh Varma, only ended up vitiating the atmosphere, fetching the party no dividends whatsoever. Mr. Kejriwal, whose early days in office wre marred by skirmishes with the Centre and pitched battles with the Lieutenant Governor, later wisely decided to sheath his sword and turn his attention to governance in a bid to better the lot of the Delhi-ites. Many of his schemes, especially those directed at women, were criticised by his political adversaries but if the results of the poll are any indication, they have clearly helped in tilting the balance in his favour. The BJP, which was quite optimistic of winning a mandate this time around, has had to eat the humble pie. As for the Congress, it is evident that it will have no further role to play in Delhi politics as the voters have rejected it lock, stock and barrel.

C.V. Aravind,

Bengaluru

The Aam Aadmi Party has ‘broom-swept’ the Delhi polls, blowing away its principal rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to smithereens. It was a high-stakes electoral contest for both the parties. While the AAP was facing an existential threat, the saffron party, after major setbacks in State elections, was desperate to arrest its diffusing political hegemony. If the AAP contested the elections largely on the strength of its governance, the BJP‘s electoral discourse was a heady mix of national and local issues like reconstruction of Ram temple, dilution of Article 370 and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The election results evidently reveal the AAP’s gratified governance triumphing over BJP’s nationalism pitch. Sadly, for Congress, its quest for regaining Delhi proved to be a damp squib, as the party once again drew blank, with its vote share dipping below 5%. The verdict sends out a loud and clear message to all the three political dispensations about their future. The impressive win provides the AAP a breathing space and a second chance to fine-tune itself as an alternative force in Indian politics. The party needs to broaden its leadership base and expand its political wings. For the BJP, the election exposed its polarisation politics, lack of second-rung leaders with political appeal, and absence of local leadership. And for the Congress, its failure to even open its account in Delhi reveals that the party is still comatose and the victories in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan were more by default than by political design.

R. Sivakumar,

Chennai

The repeat victory for Mr. Kejriwal’s AAP in the Delhi Assembly elections amply demonstrates the voters’ political maturity in refusing to be swayed by the vitriolic campaign led by Home Minister Amit Shah. It is also a triumph of good governance over any kind of polarisation. It speaks of Mr. Kejriwal’s amazing grace that he refused to be provoked even when he was called a “terrorist” by some members of the BJP. Reduced once again to a single digit in the Assembly, the lesson the BJP needs to learn is that boasts do not necessarily ensure electoral success, issues do.

S.K. Choudhury,

Bengaluru

It is highly debatable as to what extent national issues shape the outcome of an Assembly election. However, evidently, the BJP fought the Delhi Assembly elections on national issues and with national leaders. Hence, it is hard to rule out the possibility of the impact of national policy and legislation on this verdict. Undoubtedly, the BJP made CAA and NRC and associated protests as the main issues. The verdict arrived and delivered a loud and clear message: polarisation politics and tactics not always work. It is time to reset policy priorities. Unless the BJP shifts its focus to the economy, education, healthcare, and employment, among other issues, it is not going to be easy to win the hearts of masses.

386,2020/02/14,‘World Famous Lover’ review: A tiresome film built on an unconvincing premise,"The love stories become tedious to watch despite good performances from Vijay Deverakonda, Aishwarya Rajesh and Raashi Khanna

Towards the end of World Famous Lover (WFL), when Vijay Deverakonda is seated on a park bench (can’t shake off the memories of Arjun Reddy here), looking dishevelled and drained, I was reminded of his recent statement that this film will be his last love story. It’s a good decision. Because, no matter how well he performs, it’s repetitive and tiresome to watch him as the broken man pining for his love and wasting himself. This is one portion of the story, but enough already. What makes it tougher to empathise with his character is the shaky premise of WFL.

The film comes alive when Vijay becomes Seenayya in the coal mines of Yellandu, romancing Suvarna (Aishwarya Rajesh) and Smita (Catherine Tresa); and later when he lives the high life in Paris, skydiving and serenading pilot Iza (Izabelle Leite). As the shattered aspiring writer Gautam who’s hoping for the return of good old days with Yamini (Raashi Khanna), he’s back in the Arjun Reddy zone.

The crux of the film is about Gautam who is grappling with writer’s block for a year and a half! The depiction of the situation feels contrived and removed from reality. Anyone who has interacted with young, emerging authors in the last decade or so would know how many start off by keeping a day job to ensure a steady income that runs the family, but write early mornings and late evenings with dogged discipline. Some take a break for the research and writing, but there’s a deadline of a year or two, to figure out if they can get a book published. You don’t become a wreck waiting for storylines and words to dawn on you miraculously.

World Famous Lover Cast: Vijay Deverakonda, Raashi Khanna, Aishwarya Rajesh, Catherine Tresa and Izabelle Leite

Director: Kranthi Madhav

Music: Gopi Sundar

The film introduces us to Gautam’s world through the listless eyes of Yamini who is bearing the brunt of his writer’s block. He depends on her for everything and yet, has stopped noticing how his downward spiral has taken a toll on her. Understandably, she walks out.

Kranthi Madhav goes back and forth, piecing together the Gautam-Yamini romance from the sunny college days. It comes in spurts to show us Gautam of the past, before he became this self-pitying wreck.

Raashi takes a detour from the bright and chirpy parts we’ve seen her of late, to play the brooding Yamini. Her eyes do most of the talking, effectively. The dubbing could have been better though. In some places, I had to strain to catch the words.

The film’s best portions happen in Yellandu. Vijay aces the part of Seenayya, spouting Telangana dialect. The initial interaction between him and his father (Anand Chakrapani) brings in the laughs, and also lays bare their differences. Seenayya is not a bad guy; when he counsels someone to save money for his son’s education, it stems out of his own disappointments. However, he’s unfair to Suvarna who does everything she can to keep the family boat from rocking, when Seenayya romances his boss Smita. Aishwarya is a natural and plays Suvarna with conviction. This is an actor to watch out for.

Jayakrishna Gummadi’s cinematography accentuates the rugged milieu of Yellandu as much as it revels in the effortless luxury of Paris, later. Gopi Sundar’s music tonally shifts between the different stories and the ‘My Love’ track stands out.

Vijay morphs into a wealthy bachelor in Paris, romancing the French pilot Iza (Izabelle has a charming screen presence). It’s the woman, again, bearing the brunt of his recklessness.

The lead pairs of the different love stories take up most of the screen time that other characters get limited scope — like Anand Chakrapani, and Priyadarshi who appears in an extended cameo.

By the time the different stories are tied together and Gautam, the writer, understands that it’s he who has been insensitive to the women and needs course correction, it’s a long and tiring journey.

As for the cheesy title of the film, it’s tough to discuss it without throwing in a spoiler. So we’ll let that be.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/8daypj/article30819818.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WFL---aishwara-rajesh-Vijay-Deverakonda,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/world-famous-lover-review-a-tiresome-film-despite-good-performances-from-vijay-deverakonda-aishwarya-rajesh-and-raashi-khanna/article30819819.ece
387,2020/02/14,Three celebrity chefs in Delhi,"Over this weekend, Delhi will see Peter Kuruvita, Gary Foulkes, and Marco Pierre White — all three, chefs who’ve attained celebrity status — do ticketed events

Gary Foulkes, from the UK, February 15, 2020

(He’s here as a part of All Things Nice and DLF’s initiative to introduce Michelin star chefs to a Delhi audience)

“It’s going to sound like a cliche, but I love Indian food,” says Gary Foulkes, who chefs at the Michelin-star Angler in London. On his day off, he and his family enjoy spicy food, so it’s often Indian or Thai. It’s often Brigadiers, Gunpowder, and Trishna in London.

This is Gary’s third visit to India; he stayed here the longest when on a three-year trip around the world with his wife. “Most of my inspiration comes from travel,” he says. He picks up the nuances of ingredients, and uses them for their flavour profiles, without actually cooking that cuisine. For instance, he’ll infuse curry leaf into a roasted cauliflower with cashewnut milk and curd, to give it a different “flavour spectrum”. There’s also a cashewnut pesto he does, with curry leaves, salt, pepper, and olive oil.

His style of cooking he says, is “tasty, light, rooted in classic cooking techniques but delivered in a modern way, but it’s all about flavour.” At his dinner, “Expect big flavour, presentation — it’s very important to me that food looks as good as it tastes. It should be delicious,” he says. While his king fish and lamb will be similar, the menu is based around what’s of prime quality in India.

At Set’z, DLF Emporio, ₹6,500 for a five-course dinner with wine, 8 p.m.

Peter Kuruvita, from Australia, February 15, 2020

(He’s here to kick off Table Stories, a Delhi-based pop-up, by Foodink Expeditions and Roseate Hotels & Resorts, which will bring to the city 11 chefs every two weeks, upto May 10th)

He calls himself a chef, restauranteur, TV presenter, author, consultant, surgers, fisherman and family man, and tells stories that are an amalgamation of all. At a preview, he goes from person to person, pouring the coconut-based sauce onto the Snapper, as he talks of his of his grandmother’s kitchen, his own childhood in Sri Lanka, and his oldest son of three taking part in a surfing competition. Peter Kuruvita pulls up memories easily. Of his fondest food memory, he says it’d have to be “My Aunty Padmini’s breadfruit curry. She’ll still make it when she knows I’m coming. It’s just rich and creamy, nutritious, satisfying — food filled with memories.”

His life has been touched by the food of the islands: Sri Lanka, where he spent his growing-up years; Australia that he’s made home; and Fiji, where his wife comes from. “The ocean is my soul; it’s a part of me,” says the chef, whose Noosa Beach House that has a Chef Hat (Australia’s version of a Michelin star) is based around his cooking style.

His dinner is about the sea, with crab, fish, and prawn forming its core, with ingredients from the tropics: coconut, palm treacle, pineapple, tamarind. He describes his food as using the freshest ingredients from not more than 200 km away, modern, with a Sri Lankan twist. His butter-poached crab and beetroot curry are dishes to look forward to.

At The Roseatte, NH 8, D Block, Samalka; ₹6,000 upwards, for a seven-course dinner, 8 p.m.

Marco Pierre White, from the UK, February 15, 16, 2020

(As a part of Delhi’s first World on a Plate, a food festival now in its fifth edition that facilitates people’s access to international chefs)

Marco Pierre White says the rogan josh and the black dal at the JW Marriott are sensational. The Indian food here feels different to London, he says: “You get bones; I love bones, and meat always cooks better on the bone. It gives me the perfect excuse to eat with my fingers here. Also, I am a fan of mutton. In England, you put mutton on your menu, it’ll never sell,” he says, though he’s not sure why, despite mutton being more flavourful than lamb.

On his third visit to the country (his first two were also a part of World on a Plate), he’ll be doing a masterclass helping people cook a saffron risotto with vegetable stock. “It’s not about teaching people. It’s about giving people insights — insights into my world. In India you eat lots of rice, and it’s vegetarian,” he says, meaning everyone will have a taste of the food.

The class will have White engage with people in a conversation, as he invites people to cook with him, sharing the principles of making a risotto. “Once you learn the principles, then you can create your own flavours.”

Known for being the youngest chef to have three Michelin stars and then returning them later, White who was called “the original bad boy of British cooking” by The Telegraph, is relaxed and feels he’s almost on holiday in India. “This morning they made me the most delicious dosa,” he says, adding that Indian cuisine’s time is yet to come. “People in India have given me more than I have given India. In India, they don’t try to impress you. ”

388,2020/02/14,Invoking the spirit of Scotland,"Preview the oldest whisky festival in the world, in the city this weekend

Every spring, whisky enthusiasts from all over the world gather in the Speyside region of Scotland for the Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival. “This is the oldest whisky festival in the world and takes place over six days at the end of April. There are more than 120 distilleries in Scotland and half of them are in Speyside, so it’s the biggest whisky producing region,” says Swati Sharma, co-founder of the Dram Club. First launched in 1999, the 21st edition of the festival this year will celebrate Scotland’s national drink from April 29 to May 4. And for the first time, Mumbai will get a taste of the festival (and Speyside whiskies) today.

Spreading the gospel

Sharma co-founded The Dram Club in March 2019 along with Vinayak Singh, a fellow whisky lover. “Early last year, we went on a trip to Scotland where we visited quite a few distilleries. What really inspired us was the entire tasting experience, the way they talk about their heritage and philosophy of whisky making, the way they have these small stories about the history of the distillery, etc. It’s not an education, it’s more like storytelling,” says Sharma. The duo wanted to replicate the experience in India so they began curating events for acquaintances that were whisky aficionados. “The feedback was really good so we started doing it in a more formal way. We are a neutral platform and we don’t try to push any brand. It’s a more inclusive way of educating people and advocating about whisky rather than any particular kind. We have done 20 events in the last one year,” elaborates Sharma.

Flavour and balance

Both Sharma and Singh attended the Spirit of Speyside Festival last year. Over the course of six days, each of the 50-odd distilleries opens its doors to visitors (even those that are not generally open to the public) and curates unique events.

“For example, we tried a whisky and beer pairing done by Gordon & MacPhail Distillery and Windswept Brewery. There were five whiskies and five beers that worked very well with each other in terms of flavour and balance like a heavily sherried whisky that’s sweet, rich, and creamy was paired with a bitter stout beer that enhances the flavours of the whisky. Or a Game of Thrones-themed blind tasting that happened at Cardhu,” explains Sharma.

Many distilleries release limited edition festival whiskies that you can only buy during the festival. The Speyside Whisky Awards are also held during the festival. “There are four categories and each distillery sends in their nominations. Out of the 60-65 nominations that come in, an expert panel shortlists it down to eight finalists. These are voted in a blind tasting globally at different places at different times of the year,” he says.

Raising a toast

“When we started discussing about bringing the festival to India, the initial thought was to only have the blind tasting (for the awards) because it had never happened here before. As we spoke to brands, the idea emerged that maybe we should create a day that celebrates whisky where people get a feel of the festival itself,” shares Sharma. The festival will kick off with a four-course whisky-paired lunch featuring Glenlivet whiskies of different age statements. “Glenlivet 21 was one of the winners last year and the brand ambassador is coming down. Also, we have got Chef Sarita Pereira (of The Lovefools, a Mumbai-based supper club) on board to curate the lunch,” says Sharma. This will be followed by three whisky masterclasses with Glenfiddich, Amrut, and Paul John. “Amrut and the Dram Club are associating for the first time for this festival. Also Paul John’s head distiller is coming over and will be showcasing two new whiskies that will officially release at the festival,” says Sharma.

There will also be a Glen Grant masterclass pairing whiskies with desserts that complement the flavours. The highlight of the festival is the blind tasting and voting for Speyside Whisky Awards. This will be done over three sessions with batches of 20 voters each.

Spoilt for choice

What’s next for The Dram Club? Sharma says that the Speyside Whisky Festival will become an annual event. They are also working on curating an Indian version of whisky awards. “Many new brands are exploring the Indian market. With the influx of Taiwanese and Japanese whiskies and also new Scotch whiskies, we are spoilt for choice. The awards will have the Indian consumer voting for whiskies that are available in the country”, explains Sharma. The Dram Club will continue to curate whisky experiences and will add a few women-only events. “About 50-60% of our usual event audience is women. The perception that whisky is a man’s drink is changing worldwide. Also, women are more open to trying different things; men sometimes tend to get a bit stuck up saying I only drink an 18-year-old or a 20-year-old whisky or only a particular brand, but there could be better whiskies from independent bottlers”, concludes Sharma.

389,2020/02/14,Café Tesu: A place to revisit,"Now a few years old, Café Tesu continues to keep its popularity and its menu fresh

Does anybody remember the time when Essex Farms was just that — a farm that sold meat products? It’s now a bustling food hub, full of restaurants and cafes offering all kinds of cuisines.

I went there with a group of close friends the other evening, and was stunned. The city changes before you can say “paneer pasanda” — and you find that a part of it has grown into some kind of a ritzy arcade.

Let me start at the beginning. Two friends wanted to take us out to dinner. They suggested a couple of places that I had not been to. One had a menu that was not very exciting, and the other didn’t have parking space. I did a search and came across a few promising restaurants. One was Café Tesu, about which I had heard good things. I suggested it to the friends, and they were happy, as they liked the food there. So we, a group of six, landed up at Essex Farms, and found it humming with life. Café Tesu is one of the restaurants there.

We hadn’t booked a table, and when we reached, we found Tesu bursting at the seams. A helpful family waiting for dessert vacated their table for us. I had a quick look at the menu. The soups include chicken cappuccino with almond flakes (₹265), wild mushroom bisque (₹245) and khao suey (₹415-465). Salads include goat cheese and slow poached pear (₹495); on the list of small plates are kaffir lime chilli cottage cheese (₹395), baby pork ribs (₹525) and chorizo and Bratwurst (₹495). I didn’t go any further — chorizo and Bratwurst for me, I said.

The others asked for a variety of dishes — pasta with chicken, a spicy chicken pizza and a Parisian sandwich with roast chicken.

One among us was keen on a ham and brie sandwich (₹425), but the waiter said there was no brie. So my friend decided to have breakfast instead of dinner, and asked for French toast.

We were each very happy with the food. My dish of meats had been slow cooked in an oven and came with tomato fondue.

The chorizo was soft and spicy, and the Bratwurst was crispy. The Parisian sandwich (₹545) consisted of generous slices of multi-grain bread stuffed with grilled chicken tossed in red wine and served with tomato chutney and carmelised onions. The meat was juicy, and complemented the sweetness of the onions.

The spicy chicken sausage pizza (₹635) was delicious — with chicken heaped over a thin crust base. The friend loved her creamy pasta (₹575), flavoured with pine nuts. The French toast (₹325) was shared by everybody, and almost worked as dessert. This consisted of bread dipped in a custard batter, served with cinnamon cream.

Café Tesu needs a revisit. I would like to try out their lamb bourguignon — prepared with brioche buns, ground lamb meat, brie cheese, caramelised onions and red wine sauce (₹625).

The pizza section includes classic tomato and mozzarella (₹535), artichoke, mushroom, olives, jalapeno, rocket leaves and parmesan shavings (₹625) and a fig, bacon, and blue cheese pizza (₹650).

I have to thank my two friends for that delightful treat, and for introducing me to Tesu. It marks the start of a meaningful — or do I mean meat-ful? — relationship.

390,2020/02/14,"On Valentine’s Day, charcoal dosa for Chennai’s singles","The new ‘singles dosa’, made with activated charcoal, is being offered at popular Adyar Ananda Bhavan outlets

B Razappan and Mohan Raghavan are eagerly awaiting their dosa at Adyar Ananda Bhavan. When it arrives, a dozen eyes from adjoining tables peer inquisitively towards their tray — for this dosa is black in colour.

Made of activated charcoal, which gives it this unique colour, the offering is probably a first-of-its-kind from the popular A2B chain of hotels. Described as a ‘Singles Dosa’ and priced at ₹60, it is one of their hottest selling dishes this Valentine’s week.

“Doesn’t it look unique?” says Mohan, eyeing the crisp, ghee roast-like dosa on his table, “This is the first time I’m seeing any Indian food item that is black in colour.”

The concept was born when the management of A2B went through the plethora of Valentine’s Day offers for couples and realised that there was nothing for singles. “Of course, families can try it too,” smiles A2B supervisor Pranav S, adding, “We have heard of burgers using charcoal, and we thought about doing something similar in our dosa.”

The making of this dish is similar to that of traditional dosas — the only difference being the activated charcoal, which is mixed into the batter by the chef, resulting in the colour and flavour. There is a health benefit to this, too, claims Pranav. “It helps detox the body,” he says, “It has been proven that activated charcoal, if had in right proportions, can have health benefits.”

That is something we cannot quite guarantee, but the black dosa is certainly Instagram-worthy, and one that’s likely to garner a lot of likes. Admittedly, it does leave a slightly bitter taste in the mouth. However, thanks to its crispiness and ghee overload, it leaves one satiated.

With a tangy tomato chutney on the side, this charcoal dosa could well be your date this season of love.

391,2020/02/14,From the hills and vales; at the Fairfield by Marriott’s Kashmiri Food Festival in Coimbatore,"Interesting tastes, textures and aromas await the guest at Fairfield by Marriott’s Kashmiri Food Festival

“What are you doing at a Wazwan?” is the baffled response from Neela Dhar, a Kashmiri friend. I had called her to clarify something about the cuisine and she is worried that vegetarian-me will return disappointed and hungry. Her fears are unfounded, I am happy to say. The spouse and I drive off to the Kashmiri food festival at Fairfield by Marriott after many calls to the Food and Beverage Manager S Bharath, seeking assurance that there will be vegetarian fare too.

“We have plenty to offer,” smiles the fresh-faced Chef Milap Singh Jamwal who has come all the way from Srinagar to curate this festival. The husband, who served for many many years in J&K, immediately gets into a huddle with the Dogri chef and they exchange notes about little-known towns and villages, discuss threadbare the vales and mountains and exclaim about the Jammu-Baramulla railway line. Finally, we begin to eat. The heart leaps as I recognise some of the favourites Neela has cooked for me and Raju all those years ago. There is the Haak Saag, I spot shalgam (turnip) in a pulao (brings back a rush of memories of a diet consisting almost entirely of that vegetable when we were at Leh), there is the Rajma (famous of Badharwa)...

Haak Saag | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

A walk around the spread is enough to get the appetite up and running. Very interesting are a line of chutneys. We help ourselves to ALL of them in a quarter plate and eat them with Paneer Tikka and Nadru Churma (fried lotus stems that are a street food in Srinagar, I learn). The chutneys are made of pineapple, apple, walnut, radish, pumpkin, tomato and with a dried onion that Chef Milap has brought with him that he calls gand. We go for chutney refill and the next time around we eat them with soft garlic naan.

The chef draws my attention to something that looks like a broccoli; only it is beautiful purple in colour. It is mawal or the Kashmiri cockscomb, he explains, and it is used to add depth of flavour in several dishes.

The nicest thing about trying out a cuisine that is not too prevalent in these parts is its newness. It is also interesting how familiar ingredients too are used differently. For example the omni-present dumaloo is tempting and so distinct from the dum aloos we have eaten earlier. “The secret is in our asafoeteda,” I recall Neela telling me.

Just in the nick of time, after dessert, I catch sight of the Khubani Heder Shorba and I am so happy I did. A clear soup made out of the stock of apricots and mushrooms, it is light and quite delicious. The non-vegetarian alternative to that is the chicken yakhni soup. I peek into the cauldron and that looks like a clear soup too. There is mutton yakhni, fish and chicken cooked several ways, besides the famous Rogan Josh. “The menu will change every day,” says Bharath. Today’s dessert comprises meetha chawal, phirni and oddly what seems no different from the Hyderabadi shahi tukra — all tasty. The delicately fragrant Kahwa washes down the meal.

The Kashmiri Food Festival is on till February 16 for both lunch and dinner.

392,2020/02/14,Maharashtra government gives sanction for prosecution of four police officers,"State takes action in 2017 land grab case before court hearing on February 17

The Maharashtra government on Thursday gave its sanction to prosecute four officers of the Mumbai police for their involvement in a 2017 land grab case, nearly five months after the Central Bureau of Investigation sought it.

The officers to be prosecuted include a former assistant commissioner of police, who is alleged to have, along with the other three officers, forcibly evicted a developer from a 16-acre plot worth ₹60 crore at Dahisar in 2017.

The sanction for prosecution was signed by Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday night.

Sources in the government said the case will be heard on February 17 in the Bombay High Court and the State’s political leadership did not want to take a chance by delaying the permission.

Also, the CBI does not function over the weekend, so it was important to give the sanction in advance. “This (weekday) was the only window open for us to give an approval and forward it to the CBI before the court hearing,” said a source.

A court-ordered CBI enquiry had found the public servants guilty as per provisions of Section-19 (1) (b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and demanded a sanction under Section 197 (1) (b) of the Criminal Procedure Code, officials said.

The CBI had said the officers had shown ‘high handedness’ in dealing with the directors of Rommell Housing LLP, which had purchased the land at Dahisar Check Naka from two private firms.

The CBI had also said the grandson of one of the claimants of the land had alleged theft and dacoity in a first information report (FIR) at Dahisar Police Station, as a result of which the directors, Jude and Dominic Romell, were arrested. Jude Romell was granted bail in 2017.

The two approached the high court to seek a remedy against the “malafide” FIR and accused the four officers of showing “high handedness” in dealing with them.

The court ordered an enquiry by an official of the rank of joint commissioner of police and directed the government to suspend the four officers in September last year.

Late last year, the CBI registered an FIR and demanded approval for sanction against four officers including ACP (now retired) Prashant Marde, senior police inspector Subhash Sawant, then assistant police inspector Anand Jadhav and sub inspector Kakasaheb Shinde.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-government-gives-sanction-for-prosecution-of-four-police-officers/article30815126.ece
393,2020/02/14,BEST administration faces fire from committee,"Members highlight issues faced by passengers, staff due to new conductor-free buses policy

Members of the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) committee criticised the administration on Thursday for its shoddy implementation of its conductor-less bus operations, highlighting issues that both staff and passengers face due to the new policy.

Srikant Kawthankar, a committee member from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said conductors stationed on bus stops in the middle of the route do not have any access to public toilet facilities. “In running buses, conductors are able to go to bus depots to relieve themselves. In areas like Charkop, there are no public toilets. What is a conductor to do in such places? Their shift typically is for around five hours,” he said.

Highlighting the recent injury to a bus conductor on a double-decker bus, Sunil Ganacharya, another committee member from the BJP, said the move to have only one bus conductor is a safety risk to passengers as well. “The administration should give the committee a report highlighting the revenue generated from these conductor-less operations,” he said.

A committee member from the Shiv Sena, Anil Kokil, said after the introduction of wet lease buses, there was an apparent surplus of drivers at Mumbai Central and Colaba depots and the drivers were deployed across bus stops to aid conductor-less operations.

‘Skipping stops’

Committee members also said point-to-point buses often skip stops even when they are empty, leaving several passengers fuming.

General manager Surendrakumar Bagde said he would look into all the concerns and take the suggestions of the committee into consideration. “These efforts are going towards providing affordable and efficient bus transport to passengers and should also help the administration in its implementation,” he said.

At present, BEST is running conductor-less operations on 86 routes, of which 45 have buses running on wet lease. These routes have 325 mini air-conditioned buses running on them.

On the remaining 41 routes, 224 BEST-owned buses are deployed, which include a mix of full-length single-decker, midi and double-decker buses. Committee members told the administration that it should limit the conductor-less operations only to wet leased buses and continue regular operations on its owned fleet.

‘Cost cutting’

BEST uses nearly 209 conductors on the 41 bus route. Officials said the number would double if they were to assign one conductor on single-decker and two on double-decker buses. “For the double-decker buses at Bandra Kurla Complex, we needed to deploy 63 conductors. Under the new arrangement we need 37, which reduces our operational costs,” a BEST official said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/best-administration-faces-fire-from-committee/article30815076.ece
394,2020/02/14,27 win jewellery design awards,"Twenty-seven young jewellery designers have won the Artisan Jewellery Design Awards 2020.

Legendary British designer Stephen Webster gave the awards at an event in Mumbai on Thursday.

The winners were chosen from 625 entries and designed jewellery from three eras: art deco, neo futurism and Islamic arabesque.

An initiative by the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), the Artisan Awards recognise artistry, innovation and individuality. The purpose of the Artisan Awards is to inspire India’s jewellery designers to push their design boundaries and demonstrate their skill by showcasing world-class pieces.

The theme for this year’s awards, powered by the Gemological Institute of America, was ‘Architectural Gems’. Apart from the three general categories, there was a special category for Best Product Inventory at IIJS Signature 2020.

Harjas Kaur was declared the winner in the art deco category; the winner in neo futurism was Namrata Bhardwaj, while the winner in Islamic arabesque was Koushik Mondal.

Pramod Kumar Agrawal, chairman, GJEPC, said, “India has an extremely talented pool of jewellery designers. The objective of these awards is to encourage and motivate our students and designers to reach their full potential and make it big in this industry.”

Mr. Webster said, “For a piece of jewellery, materials are everything. Materials and craft form the basis, but the element of design pushes things further.” Design competitions, he said, are important because they challenge participants to push themselves creatively, to stretch their boundaries.

“India is steeped in tradition and has influenced nearly all jewellery designers,” Mr. Webster said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/27-win-jewellery-design-awards/article30815070.ece

396,2020/02/14,Etihad to add flights to two southern cities,"Seasonal services added for May

Etihad Airways, the national airline of United Arab Emirates (UAE), has announced plans to add seasonal services to Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram for May.

The airline will add 158 seats to each route, and will put A320s into service. As a result of these changes, Etihad will operate 21 weekly flights to and from Chennai, and 14 weekly flights to and from Thiruvananthapuram during this period. It already runs 161 return flights per week between Abu Dhabi and 10 key Indian cities.

The changes were announced by the airline’s senior officials who were in India as part of the airline’s ongoing activities to celebrate 15 years of flying to India. Etihad began operations in India in September 2004 and has grown to become its second largest market after the UAE, carrying over 18 million passengers to and from the country.

Mumbai was the first route in the country to be served by the airline and today, the city ranks highest in terms of total passengers the airline has carried over the years, with the number exceeding 3.5 million.

Danny Barranger, Etihad Airways’ senior vice president (global sales), said, “Etihad Airways remains committed to its largest and busiest market, India. We are proud that today Etihad Airways serves more destinations in India than any other country across its network.”

Neerja Bhatia, Etihad Airways’ vice president (Indian subcontinent), said, “India plays a crucial role in Etihad Airways’ growth strategy, contributing significantly to the airline’s global operations and we are honoured to support demand in one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world.”

Officials declined comment on Jet Airways, which is undergoing resolution proceedings at the National Company Law Tribunal.

397,2020/02/14,9 hurt as cylinder explodes in Kandivali,"Blast occurs due to leak while fixing gas regulator; 5 victims still under observation

Nine people were injured when a gas cylinder exploded in a chawl in Kandivali on Wednesday night. The injured were admitted to Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivali.

While four were treated and discharged, the remaining five are stable and undergoing treatment.

The incident occurred at Sandip Kanade’s house at Nana Gaware Chawl in Kandivali (East) around 11 p.m. According to the police, there was a leak when Rajesh Dubale (40) was fixing the regulator on the cylinder in the house.

The police said the gas spread to a small lamp burning in the prayer area and it led to the blast. Bhagwat Vyavhare, sub-inspector at Samta Nagar police station, said, “It appears to be an accident. No complaint has been filed so far.”

Five adults and the one-year-old son of Mr. Kanade were present in the house when the cylinder exploded. A few boys who were sitting outside the house on a bench also suffered injuries.

Gaurav Gawande, Mr. Kanade’s brother-in-law, said, “Just before the blast, my sister realised that there was something amiss and she picked up the baby and ran out. Both of them are fine. My brother-in-law, his mother, nephew and a neighbour are still in the hospital. The others who have been discharged are who were those in the vicinity. The fire destroyed the ground floor of the two-storey house. The refrigerator also partially melted in the blaze.”

398,2020/02/14,Byculla Zoo gets two new feline residents,"Zoo gets tigers after 14 years; new pair will be in quarantine for a month

After 14 years, Byculla zoo got a pair of tigers from the Aurangabad zoo on Wednesday, but Mumbaikars will have to wait for a month to see them.

The young Royal Bengal tiger and tigress are healthy and will be quarantined for a month for acclimatisation. Only after that will Mumbaikars be able to take a look at them. In exchange, Byculla zoo has given two pairs of spotted deer and painted storks to Aurangabad zoo.

The last tiger in Byculla zoo died in 2006. After bringing Humboldt penguins to the zoo in the second phase of its revamp, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has undertaken several new initiatives, the most recent being the inauguration of a walk-through aviary.

A pair of leopards was brought to the zoo last year from Mangaluru. The civic administration wants to bring in exotic animals and a pair of Asiatic lions from Gujarat. The process to procure these lions is still under way.

The tiger, Shakti, is a little over three years old while the tigress, Karishma, is around 5.5 years old. A zoo official said there was also a tigress named Kareena in the Aurangabad zoo.

Shakti and Karishma had paired up in their previous home. They are categorised as young adult tigers and both weigh 180-200 kg. Since they have been bred in captivity and have lived in Aurangabad zoo all their lives, they are accustomed to the presence of humans.

For the exchange, the big cats had to be coaxed into the cage that would then be loaded onto a truck. Authorities said it took them around 24 hours to just coax them, as according to the rules, animals are not sedated during transportation.

The cages were made as per Central Zoo Authority guidelines with enough ventilation, and loaded onto a truck that halts every couple of hours. A team of veterinarians from Byculla zoo checked on the animals every few hours. After a journey of around 14 hours from Aurangabad, they arrived at Byculla zoo around 10 p.m. on Wednesday, following which they ate a regular meal.

“The fact that they ate a meal at night means that they are comfortable. They slept properly at night, which also shows they are relaxed. Since we have spent the past few days with them, they are responding to our voice now. But it will take longer to build trust. The caretakers at Aurangabad spoke to them in Marathi, and so we do too,” said a veterinarian doctor at Byculla zoo.

According to veterinarians, Shakti is the dominant one, although Karishma is also aggressive. The animals eat around 13 kg of buffalo meat per day.

The zoo authorities expect them to mate, and Byculla zoo may in the event get tiger cubs. After the quarantine period is over, the pair will move to a large enclosure inside the zoo designed on the lines of Ranthambore national park. Work on the enclosure is in its final stages and Zoo director Sanjay Tripathi said that by the time the quarantine period is over, the animals can move into their enclosure.

Mayor Kishori Pednekar visited the pair on Thursday. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will most likely inaugurate the enclosure.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/oiz58i/article30814947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BM-tigers,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/byculla-zoo-gets-two-new-feline-residents/article30814948.ece
399,2020/02/14,Fire breaks out in Andheri MIDC,"Smoke hampers firefighting efforts; no casualties reported

At least 100 personnel of the Mumbai Fire Brigade brought under control a massive fire that broke out on the second floor of a ground-plus-four-storey building in Andheri MIDC at 11.45 a.m. on Thursday. The building was empty at the time of the incident and no casualties were reported.

The fire that erupted in the server room of Rolta, a multinational company, in Marol was categorised as Level IV (major). Twelve fire engines and jumbo tankers were rushed to the spot. A fire engine from MIDC Fire Brigade was already at the site. The fire destroyed electric wiring, furniture, office records, computers, AC sheets, aluminium plates and files in the building.

Jagdish Shinde, senior police inspector, MIDC police station, said, “The building was owned by Rolta. The office has not been in operation for three years.”

The operation was challenging for the firefighters as dense smoke filled the staircase and tremendous heat was generated owing to the burning of the aluminium cladding. As water cannot be sprayed on buildings with a glass facade, the firefighters had to enter it with thermal imaging cameras and breathing apparatuses.

The Mumbai Fire Brigade claimed that the building’s firefighting equipment was partially dysfunctional. P.S. Rahangdale, chief fire officer, Mumbai Fire Brigade, and director, Maharashtra Fire Services, said, “Only the hydrant system was functioning, the sprinklers and detectors were not. The roof had been closed and the passages were encroached upon. The MIDC will have to explain how these violations took place and if inspection was done. If not, I will issue a show-cause notice.”

Meanwhile, Milind Ogale, deputy chief fire officer of MIDC Fire Brigade, said the building’s firefighting system was functioning. He said, “We used it for four hours. The neighbouring building’s system was also functioning. The legalities will have to be checked by MIDC.”

P. Anbalgan, CEO of MIDC, was not available for comment on the issue.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/h9tv4n/article30814938.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMMAJORFIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fire-breaks-out-in-andheri-midc/article30814939.ece

401,2020/02/14,BJP plays Savarkar card yet again,"How helpless is Sena, asks Fadnavis

Calling the Shiv Sena “helpless”, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday said the ruling party is ignoring the attacks on Hindutva ideologue V.D. Savarkar by its ally, Congress, to save the three-party government.

Mr. Fadnavis was referring to two articles published in State Congress magazine Shidori, which allegedly describe Savarkar as a rapist and an apologiser, not a freedom fighter.

“These references are part of two separate articles published in the magazine. I wonder how helpless is the Sena for power that its ally is defaming Sena’s ideologue, Savarkar. The magazine should be banned and the Congress should apologise for the malicious content against Savarkar,” Mr. Fadnavis, the Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, said.

The Congress hit back at the BJP leader, saying not a single word written in the article is without the proof. “We have nothing against Savarkar as a person. But we certainly oppose him ideologically and will continue to do so. There is no question of apologising and taking back the article. Each and every word is written with scrutiny and proof,” Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said. He said the BJP is purposely playing politics over a non-issue.

Mr. Fadnavis said the Sena, a former ally of the BJP, should answer how many insults it can tolerate from its new ally. “The Sena should make its stand clear on whether it agrees to the description of Savarkar in the magazine officially published by the Congress,” he said. He also questioned the Sena’s position on the removal of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s statue in Chhidawara in Madhya Pradesh, which is governed by the Congress.

Mr. Sawant said the MP government under Kamal Nath has already ordered an inquiry into the incident, and the guilty will be punished. “The BJP it seems has no issue on its hands and is trying to play politics with every matter,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bjp-plays-savarkar-card-yet-again/article30814913.ece
402,2020/02/14,Archiving queer lives in poetry,"In a day-long workshop, gender non-conforming Berlin-based poet, Sailesh Naidu, will ask participants to imagine a queer future

Gender non-conforming Berlin-based poet and performance artist, Sailesh Naidu’s work stands at the intersection of sexuality, migration, race and class. In the pursuit to understand their own complex identities, they started conducting poetry workshops in Berlin to provide space to other queer and gender non-conforming people to express and discover themselves.

In the process, they realised that there was a wealth of stories that ought to be archived as personal and collective queer histories. After receiving a positive response in the German capital, Naidu decided to take the workshop outside Berlin for the first time and will be conducting it in Mumbai on Sunday at the Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan.

“A lot of my work is centred around understanding my own queerness as a child of diaspora parents [in the U.S.] and how it has been shaped by migration,” informed Naidu. Funded by the Berlin Senate for Culture and Europe, the day-long workshop is open to queer, trans, non-binary and gender non-conforming participants, where participants will be asked to imagine what a queer future will look like. Through readings of other brown and black poets, Naidu will encourage the participants to find their own voice.

According to Naidu, it is important for queer lives to be chronicled. “Especially in the moment where we are living right now when fascist and right-wing movements are taking shape, queer and gender non-conforming people are at the frontline of being attacked, diminished and made invisible during these struggles,” they said. “Queer lives, just by existing, is political.”

The goal for Naidu, ultimately, is to build an archive of poems, which currently exists as a personal collection from various workshops that they have conducted. They want to raise funds to showcase the poems in galleries and on digital platforms to generate visibility.

“It’s important because when you look at India, there is such a deep historical erasure around queerness through British colonial laws, current ruling governments and education systems. That’s why these archival projects are so important in post-colonial countries where we are unearthing our histories and understand queerness, not through Western identities,” observed the 35-year-old poet.

Currently working on their first poetry book Territory, Naidu often finds themselves at the crossroads of queerness and colonialism. “My dad was a Telugu speaker and my mom spoke Kannada. But growing up in the States, they didn’t want to teach me my mother tongues because they feared I wouldn’t integrate well,” informed Naidu. “I don’t have a command of either my native languages [which] I was denied because of racist practices within the education and social systems, so now when I do this workshop I still do it in colonial language, so there’s something to critique there.”

Naidu finds it noteworthy that queer archival work in post-colonial countries like India is largely limited to English, a colonial lingua franca. “These are interesting intersections to explore as the project grows, and ideally we want to explore how does poetry look for queer people in their native languages and in languages that haven’t been colonised,” they concluded.

The workshop will be held at Gallery MMB, Fort, on Sunday from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. Participants can register on poeticinterventions@gmail.com",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/n1yvyb/article30814885.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMQueer-spaces,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/archiving-queer-lives-in-poetry/article30814887.ece

The Maharashtra government will give homes to nearly 5,000 dabbawalas under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY).

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday directed that immediate action should be taken to resolve the housing issues of the men involved in the popular tiffin delivery service.

A meeting was held by Maharashtra Labour Minister Dilip Walse-Patil; Additional Chief Secretary of Housing Department, Sanjay Kumar; Additional Chief Secretary of Revenue Department Manukumar Srivastava; Principal Secretary of the Labour Development Department Rajesh Kumar, and MHADA vice president Milind Maheskar.

Mr. Pawar said the expertise of the dabbawalas in Mumbai has been appreciated worldwide.

“Tourists and students come from all over the world to learn the skills of dabbawalas. There should be a separate building showcasing their work. For this, a Mumbai dabbawala building will be constructed immediately,” Mr. Pawar said.

404,2020/02/14,State to train graduates to work with administration,"Initiative to cover one lakh youths under e-skill 2020 mission

As part of the Maharashtra government’s soon-to-be-launched Maha e-skill 2020 mission, the government will extend a one-and-a-half-year certificate course to over one lakh graduates in the State by giving them an opportunity to work with the government administration, from the tehsil to secretariat level.

Each candidate will be provided with a fixed stipend of ₹9,000 per month for a period of one year during the tenure.

The move comes in the wake of reports of cancellation of the ‘CM fellow’ scheme started by the previous Bharatiya Janata Party government, uner which selected youngsters were working directly in coordination with the Chief Minister’s Office and monitoring the implementation of various government schemes at the local level.

According to an official from the State’s Skill Development Department, the new scheme will provide the opportunity to over one lakh graduates, irrespective of their field of education, to work directly with various government departments.

“The first six months will contain practicals. The trainees will be learning about all the functions of the government: the different works and departments. In the next year, these youngsters will be given actual work in their respective departments,” said an official from the Skill Development Department.

The scheme is a part of the MVA government’s larger Maha e-Skill Mission 2020, which is likely to be announced on May 1, which is celebrated as Maharashtra Day.

“These individuals will be trained in the functioning of the government as well as learn how various decisions are taken and schemes implemented for the greater public good,” said the officer.

The experience will open up private as well as government-sector opportunities.

The only criterion to apply for this will be the completion of graduation from any stream.

“We believe this skill development will result in making youngsters ready for the job market. We are in the final stage of preparation of a vision document for the scheme,” he said.

Skill Development Minister Nawab Malik said his department is in the process of being revamped and he will soon be announcing measures for this.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/state-to-train-graduates-to-work-with-administration/article30814850.ece
405,2020/02/14,Careful! That dating app might lead to more than heartbreak,"Nearly 2,000 malicious files imitating popular apps uploaded to stores: study

Your search for a soulmate on online dating apps might actually be harming you in ways you don’t even realise. A recent study by Kaspersky has found that close to 2,000 malicious files were uploaded to app stores last year with the same names and logos as popular dating apps, with a majority of them masquerading as Tinder, which is among the most popular.

The report, which was released on Thursday, said Kasperky analysed malware using the names of more than 20 popular dating applications and the keyword ‘dating’ for 2019.

“The study showed that 1,963 unique files were spread in 2019 under the guise of legitimate applications. Notably, 1,262 of these were masking under Tinder and 263 files as Badoo, both of which are recognised worldwide,” a statement from Kaspersky said.

Cyber crime officials said malicious files can be programmed to do anything, from stealing sensitive data on the identity or financial details of the victim, to bombarding their devices with advertisements. “For instance, one of the applications that at first glance looks like Tinder is in fact a banking Trojan that constantly requests accessibility service rights, and upon getting them, grants itself all rights necessary to steal money from the user. Another names itself as ‘Settings’ right after installation, shows a fake ‘error’ message and later disappears, with a high likelihood it will return with unwanted ads a few days later,” the report said.

The revelation comes days after The Hindu reported that 98% of a huge stash of credit and debit card details put up for sale on the dark net belonged to Indians. The data packet was uploaded to Joker’s Stash, an underground portal for sensitive data, on February 5, as per a report by Singapore-based cyber security firm Group-IB.

As most dating apps require the user to enter at least some personal information for verification purposes, submitting such details to these malicious files also gives rise to data theft rackets. Cyber crime agencies across the world have for a long time been tracking the sale of huge packets of data on the dark net.

“Love is one of those topics that interest people universally, and, of course, that means that cyber criminals are also there. Online dating has made our lives easier and yet uncovered new risks on the path to love. We advise users to stay attentive and use legal versions of applications that are available in official application stores,” Vladimir Kuskov, head of advanced threat research and software classification at Kaspersky, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/8cbtng/article30814828.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14bmdatingappnew-dating-app,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/careful-that-dating-app-might-lead-to-more-than-heartbreak/article30814829.ece
406,2020/02/14,7 arrested in ₹4 crore bank fraud,"Accused forge cheque to transfer money from private company’s bank account

The Panvel City police have arrested seven people who forged cheques and transferred ₹4.10 crore from the bank account of Herbal Life International Pvt Ltd.

The accused have been identified as advocate Aarafat Hanif Shaikh (33), a resident of Sector 17 in Nerul; Mukesh Lakshman Prasad Gupta (45), a sales manager at ICICI Bank’s Old Panvel branch; Vinod Madhukar Bhosale (44), a resident of Kalamboli who runs a construction business; Javed Habib Ahmad Qureshi (55), a resident of JJ Road in Mumbai; Shrijil Mohanan Kurupambil (39), a resident of Dombivali; Ramkishan Lularknath Pandey (51), an exporter from Ulhasnagar; and Amitara Aurovido Mitra (61), a consultant from Santacruz with a degree in microbiology from Germany.

The complaint was filed by the manager of ICICI Bank’s Old Panvel branch on February 8. According to the complaint, on February 5, a man submitted an application at the branch to change the registered mobile number attached to the bank account of Herbal Life International Pvt Ltd. The application had the letterhead and digital signature of the company.

Later, another man entered the branch with a cheque of the company and sought to transfer ₹4.10 crore via real-time gross settlement (RTGS) to the bank account of RK Enterprises at Induslnd Bank’s Koparkhairane branch. After the money was transferred, Herbal Life International Pvt Ltd received a notification via email regarding the transaction. The company informed ICICI Bank that it had neither issued a cheque nor requested to change its mobile number. ICICI Bank then informed Induslnd Bank to freeze the transferred amount. However, the accused had withdrawn ₹4 lakh from the bank account.

Ashok Dudhe, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone II), said, “We informed ICICI Bank officials to inform us if any person visits the bank to enquire about the transaction.” A team comprising senior police inspector Ajay Landge, assistant police inspectors Nilesh Rajput and Ishan Kharote, and police personnel was formed to nab the accused. When Mr. Pandey turned up at the bank, the officials alerted the police and they arrested him. Mr. Pandey’s interrogation led the police to the remaining accused and the final arrest in the case was made on Wednesday.

The police said Mr. Shaikh was the mastermind of the fraud and had been planning it for the past six months. Mr. Shaikh first asked Mr. Pandey to open an account at Induslnd Bank and then got in touch with Mr. Gupta with the help of an accused, who is still absconding. Mr. Shaikh paid Mr. Gupta and the wanted accused ₹10,000 each to obtain the account number and cheque numbers of Herbal Life International Pvt Ltd.

Mr. Dudhe said, “Mr. Shaikh chose the company as it used to make many transactions and had a hefty sum in its account.” Mr. Shaikh then used details on the company’s website to forge the letterhead, download the digital signature and create a rubber stamp. He handed over the forged documents to Mr. Mitra, who submitted the application to change the company’s registered mobile number.

Meanwhile, Mr. Qureshi procured fake cheques from Delhi and gave them to Mr. Bhosale, who passed them on to Mr. Kurupambil. The police said it was Mr. Kurupambil who submitted the cheque at ICICI Bank. “We are probing how the fake cheques were made. They even had the unique watermark due to which they were cleared. More arrests will be made if other bank employees are found to be involved in the fraud,” Mr. Dudhe said. The accused have been remanded in police custody till Saturday.

Employee suspended

An ICICI Bank spokesperson said, “We received a cheque along with an RTGS instruction ostensibly from the customer. Therefore, money was transferred to a third party account of a different bank, as per the instruction. Then, the customer informed us that it had not issued the cheque. Taking cognisance of the complaint, we immediately requested the other bank to freeze the account. While a fraction of the amount was withdrawn by the fraudsters from an ATM in Delhi, most of the amount was put under freeze with the other bank. This amount is available in the banking system. The bank has a zero tolerance policy for any act of indiscretion or fraud. The employee, who has been found involved, has been suspended. The bank has been extending full cooperation to the investigating authorities.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/g2ndhx/article30814801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMICICI-Bank,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/7-arrested-in-4-crore-bank-fraud/article30814802.ece
407,2020/02/14,State asks Barve for clarification on work orders issued to CrispQ,"Police Commissioner’s son allegedly did not go through bidding process

The Maharashtra government has sought further explanation from Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve on allegations that his son received work orders from the government by bypassing guidelines.

Mr. Barve was summoned by Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and Additional Chief Secretary Sanjay Kumar on Thursday. “I have summoned him for an explanation at 3.30 p.m. and will seek a clarification from him on accusations,” Mr. Deshmukh told The Hindu.

In a possible case of conflict of interest, CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt. Ltd., a firm owned by Mr. Barve’s son and wife, attempted to get work in several State agencies without going through any competitive bidding process.

Earlier, Mr. Barve had met Mr. Kumar and informed him that due processes were followed. As per government records released on Tuesday, CrispQ received its last work order on October 7, 2019. This was an offer for providing Notesheet Plus (a digital paperless inter-office platform) to the Mumbai Police on a pro bono basis for a period of five years.

“The resource quota as required by Mumbai Police may be finalised after discussion with the Commissioner of Police,” reads the offer letter signed by joint secretary Sunil Sovitkar.

Earlier, it was reported that CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt. Ltd. had also attempted to get work orders in three other State agencies. At least one of these passed an adverse remark on Notesheet Plus. The agencies approached by Mr. Barve’s son Sumukh and wife Sharmila were Maharastra State Security Corporation, and the information technology (IT) and assessment departments of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).

Sources in the BMC had said that consultant M/s KPMG Global had passed an adverse remark, as did the then director of the IT department, BMC, who was not in favour of ‘bypassing norms’. However, the higher-ups had continued to build pressure to approve the product, officials involved said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fwa1cd/article30814784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMSANJAYBARVE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/state-asks-barve-for-clarification-on-work-orders-issued-to-crispq/article30814785.ece
408,2020/02/14,Man who posed as Muslim cleric arrested for theft,"Accused nabbed from Uttar Pradesh

The Panvel City police have arrested a 42-year-old man who posed as a Muslim cleric during the day and committed thefts at night.

A team led by police sub inspector Sunil Tarmale arrested Hussain Arif Sajeed Hussain from Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, on Monday and brought him to Navi Mumbai on Wednesday. He was produced before the court and has been remanded in police custody till Saturday. The police began its probe after a case of theft of an Alto car was registered on September 8, 2019. Technical evidence showed that the car had travelled to U.P.

“With the help of informers we tracked Mr. Hussain and found him using the car. We also found that he was arrested in 2016 for breaking into houses in Taloja, Rabale, Khalapur and Kalyan,” Mr. Tarmale said.

The police said Mr. Hussain visited mosques and posed as a cleric. “He would dress up as a cleric and offer prayers at mosques. No one suspected him as he looked like a pious man. He would either steal mobile phones or cash kept in the watchman’s cabin as he noticed that no one registered complaints in such instances. His aim was to make money to survive the next day,” Mr. Tarmale said.

The police have recovered two mobile phones from the accused.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/c7oy5c/article30814772.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BMMaulana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/man-who-posed-as-muslim-cleric-arrested-for-theft/article30814773.ece

410,2020/02/14,Murakami in the house,"A brunch at Antilla, a quick introduction to dandiya and conversations on art and turtles

There are homes, mansions and palaces, and then there’s Antilla, the soaring family home of Mukesh and Nita Ambani. Sweeping in scale, the 27-storey, 4,00,000 sq ft building may not be the city’s tallest, but it is certainly the most iconic. Last Sunday, I pulled into its driveway. At the entrance stood the iconic bright red Robert Indiana LOVE sculpture, one of the most recognised pop art images of the 20th century. How fabulous.

I was feeling art withdrawal pangs — I had major FOMO, missing the Samdani Art Foundation’s Dhaka Art Summit in Bangladesh, wonderfully curated by Diana Campbell Betancourt — when an invite came from none other than Isha Ambani Piramal. It was for a brunch in honour of renowned artist Takashi Murakami, considered the face of Japanese contemporary art. It was his first trip to India.

As I walked into one of Antilla’s plush living rooms, with its huge double height windows, the first person I encountered was Murakami himself. “Hi, Takashi,” he said, disarmingly. Dressed in a camouflage green jacket, blue sweater, and army fatigue cargo pants, the 58-year-old sported a ponytail and a shaggy beard. He seemed delighted to be here. For Murakami’s benefit, the afternoon began with a dandiya performance. He clearly enjoyed the spectacle, whipping out his phone to take videos of the dance troupe and even sportingly hitting some sticks.

For those who can’t remember, Murakami became a global name in 2002 when designer Marc Jacobs, then helming Louis Vuitton, invited him to put his art on the house’s signature monogrammed handbags. It was a spectacular success and just the kind of pick-me-up the depressed economic climate of the new century needed after the catastrophe of 9/11. I lived in New York back then and remember the huge craze and waiting lists for those bags. And to think that buzz was before the advent of social media. The founder of ‘superflat’, a post Second World War Japanese art movement that draws inspiration from anime and manga, Murakami’s quirky, whimsical designs for Louis Vuitton were the kind of intervention that makes the collision of fashion and art so exciting. And he was Asian!

Now, 18 years later, here I was, telling him about our local art scene with its many positives (great art, growing interest, healthier market) but plenty of drawbacks (contemporary art viewed as elitist, not enough patronage, not enough institutional support). He listened attentively and didn’t speak much. His own company, Kaikai Kiki, nurtures and incubates emerging Japanese artists.

Murakami’s more recent collaborations — with Kanye West, Pharell Williams and Virgil Abloh — have bestowed upon him a rock star status. He’s one of a handful of artists with worldwide name recognition. His pieces fetch a lot of money at auctions (Sotheby’s sold his artwork My Lonesome Cowboy for $13.5 million in 2008) and he continues to push the boundaries of ‘high’ and ‘low’ art.

Later, after a sumptuous lunch of South Indian, Gujarati and continental food, we had a Q&A with Murakami, culminating in a hilarious rapid-fire round conducted by Isha. Amongst other things, she asked him what he did for fun — he was flummoxed by the question — and about his pets (turtles and a fish who recognises him). As for India, he seemed seduced. “Artists are super geeks, all the time in the studio, but sometimes come out to the real environment, like now. I am getting a lot of information on this town,” Murakami said. “Many countries forget about history, they just transform to what is contemporary, like in fashion and culture, but here there is a very deep combination. It is fantastic.” Indeed it is.

411,2020/02/14,The rogues on our roads,"Do motorists need sensitisation programmes and special training modules on traffic laws? asks Nidhi Adlakha

When you get on the road, you don’t know what awaits you. Much like a game of Road Rash, you need to be alert enough to tackle everything from jaywalkers and overspeeding drivers to vehicles driving on the wrong side. And as much as I try to feature a new topic every fortnight, it seems impossible not to write about roads and pedestrian infrastructure again and again.

While issues such as the lack of continuous footpaths, walkways and foot overbridges have been highlighted in earlier columns, it is perhaps time to focus on what we, the public, are doing wrong.

Last month, the government launched the Integrated Road Accident Database (IRAD) — a central accident database management system — to help analyse the reasons behind the high accident rate and to offer safety measures. It is to be piloted in the six States with the highest road fatalities, and it isn’t surprising that Tamil Nadu features on the list. But officials needn’t look too far to analyse the reasons behind accidents.

Chennai’s report card Chennai topped the ‘Road Accident Analysis in Tamil Nadu January 2019’ report with 689 road accidents of a total of 5,173. It also had the most fatalities (114 of 993) in January. Published by the Transport and Road Safety Commissioner, Chennai, the report also highlighted that the maximum number of accidents were caused by two-wheelers: 43.94%. A far stricter procedure to issue driving licences — along with a mandatory module on traffic laws — is necessary.

Blame game

The State has always been known for its notorious drivers, lack of informed policing, drunken driving, underaged motorists, and drivers without a licence. While waiting at a traffic signal recently, I noticed a two-wheeler driver request the traffic policeman on duty to let him enter General Patters Road (one-way) from the wrong side. The cop swiftly moved a barricade to let him do so.

Scenes like these are now commonplace, and I wonder who is to blame: motorists who will do anything to find a shorter route, or officials who bend the laws to suit their convenience or pockets. Much to my father’s dismay (who spent months teaching me to drive), I rarely get behind the wheel these days as I’d rather walk or hail a cab than deal with drivers who put the lives of others at risk. I know of several others like me who choose public transport over driving through the mismanaged traffic.

Implementation woes

Every weekend, police cars are religiously stationed along roads to charge stiff penalties for drunk driving, so why not make this the norm through the week? Why are motorists who jump signals or caught speeding let off the hook so easily?

As per government data, over 60% of road fatalities across the country in 2018 were due to overspeeding.

Over the last few years, Chennai Corporation has pulled up its socks and introduced a slew of pedestrian-friendly measures: the city’s first pedestrian plaza in T. Nagar, cycling tracks and, most recently, the Mega Streets Programme. Launched earlier this week, the ₹10,000 crore project aims to develop arterial streets, create walking and cycling routes, parks, public transport nodes, and parking places, among other things.

It’s refreshing to see some effort being put into making Chennai more liveable, but like most projects, implementation and upkeep is where we fall behind. Take the pedestrian plaza at Pondy Bazaar: within three months of its launch, things are gradually slipping. We now see two-wheelers parked on the walkway, motorists driving on walkways, and many violating the one-way rule. To make matters worse, trees have been axed in places that were touted as ‘green’ zones — with residents alleging it is to keep a few shopkeepers happy.

Citizen curriculum

How can we make things better? We need to train people to be sensitive to their surroundings and to traffic laws, or perhaps even learn a lesson or two from Singapore. As part of the Singapore Citizenship Journey programme, new citizens undergo training in a mandatory curriculum before becoming full-fledged members of society.

The Mumbai Police’s ingenious ‘Punishing Signal’ campaign is a step in the right direction. The video that went viral this month shows how officials in ‘the honking capital of the world’ connected decibel meters to traffic signals (in areas where people honk unnecessarily). If decibel levels went above 85db, the signal would restart and force motorists to wait longer.

Now, this is an initiative all our cities can definitely benefit from.",columns,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/f5zb55/article30819751.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-120931491,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/on-dealing-with-the-rogues-on-our-roads/article30819752.ece
412,2020/02/14,"This is warfare, not welfare","A little less hypocrisy and a little more understanding of real child rights can come handy

Last December, when winter was at its most severe in North India, 104 infants died in a government hospital in Rajasthan. Investigations found that several infant incubators were not working, windowpanes were broken, and there were even pigs roaming on the premises.

104 infants died. In a government hospital. There were headlines, there was outrage, there was political finger-pointing. I don’t, however, remember any anxious pre-teen writing precociously to the highest court flagging the deaths. Nor do I remember the courts taking suo motu cognizance of the deaths.

Then, a couple of weeks ago, a four-month-old baby who had been at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh where his mother Nazia was protesting with other women, succumbed to a chill he caught in the bitter cold. Lo and behold, there has emerged from the woodwork an entire army of child welfare enthusiasts. A 12-year-old has dashed off a letter accusing both the protest organisers and the infant’s parents of not protecting the infant’s rights. And on Monday, the Supreme Court took suo motu notice to ask how an infant could go to a protest site. “We have highest concern for children, and they should not be treated badly,” said the court.

The Sanghi army has risen in a chorus of maternal solicitude, demanding stern action against mothers who drag infants to protest sites. ‘How dare she!’ they fulminate. When all they should do is read the story of Rani Lakshmi Bai on that supremely patriotic website called hindujagruti.org, which has a painting of the Rani fighting on horseback with her son Damodar tied to her, and the words, ‘Such an extraordinary lady, who tied her son on her back while fighting the battle, will not be found in the history of the world.’

Instead, they shriek, ‘Irresponsible parenting!’ And modern young women ask why the infants weren’t left behind, or the husbands asked to babysit. I smote my forehead. But of course! All that these wealthy women need do is hire a nanny. Or find a crèche. Or tell their woke husbands to look after the baby while they dash off in high heels to Shaheen Bagh for a cuppa and biryani with the gals.

For such progressive people, here are some facts, in very easy prose: these are women whose very identity as citizens is at stake. They have been at the site for weeks on end — this is the 63rd day of the protest. They simply don’t have the luxury of finding alternative childcare. Entire families have abandoned home and hearth and basic comforts to fight the astonishingly discriminatory Citizenship Amendment Act and they are not about to stop anytime soon. And that means they have to bring aunts and grandparents and babies to the site, so that they are all together, taking care of one another as best as they can. After all, this country isn’t exactly looking after their interests, is it?

I would love our learned judges and our zealous Sanghi compatriots to visit a construction site one day or accompany a family of rag-pickers on their rounds each morning. I would love to see them expound child welfare to a migrant labourer who has two children playing by the roadside and an infant sleeping in a hammock made from an old sari tied to a tree branch, as she trudges back and forth with stone chips on her head. I would love for them to visit the pavement dwellers of New Delhi huddled every winter night in shanties, babies all around them, warmed by nothing more than tiny newspaper fires. Not to mention domestic workers whose one request often is to bring their infants to work because there’s no place to leave them.

This is not negligence; it is desperation. And that is exactly the state of mind of the mothers who are turning up at Shaheen Bagh day after day. This protest is not a luxury that they can opt out of. It is their very future.

Every pundit out there pontificating on child welfare to a mother who is mourning her dead infant should either be able to show that no desperate mother anywhere in India ever carries her child to work or to market or to the hospital where her husband lies dying. Or they should simply shut up.

413,2020/02/14,This septuagenarian couple is touring across India in a Morgan three-wheeler,"Alan and Pat Braithwaite are driving around to raise funds for Goonj that works with women welfare

A Morgan three-wheeler isn’t perhaps the first choice for a 5,600 kilometres drive across India. But, 73-year-old Pat Braithwaite and her husband Alan from Suffolk, England, thought otherwise and hopped into the two-seater, open-top vintage sports car. They are doing it to raise awareness and funds for non-governmental organisation Goonj that works for the welfare of women, disaster relief and upcycling. They hope to raise £200,000 for the organisation, a part of which will be given over to academic research.

The road trip began on February 1 from Mumbai. “It was a bumpy start as we had to spend over seven hours trying to get our car out of customs,” says Alan. The couple visited a facility of Goonj in Mumbai where old clothes are collected from various parts of the city, processed and shipped to their other centres for up-cycling. “We also visited a school where we interacted with the kids and explained to them all about our tour and the need for a circular economy where products are recycled and reused,” says Pat.

From Mumbai, the team drove through Pune, Solapur, Khamman and Rajahmundry before making a pitstop at Visakhapatnam.

Queen Bee as they fondly call their car on account of its black and yellow appearance has been drawing a lot of attention, obviously. She turns heads, people slow down to take a closer look at her and capture her on their phones. That works to the advantage of Pat and Alan and their mission. “Whenever we stop for a quick bite, we talk to people and inform them about our initiative. People love to know more about the car. They want to know how much it costs and what its mileage is,” laughs Pat.

Once, narrates Alan, with relish, a cop pulled them over. “When he stopped us I scuried for all the necessary documents thinking he wanted to check if our papers were in order. It turned out he only wanted to take pictures of the car!” Through the journey the couple is also learning more about Indian culture and it’s various cuisine. “The Indian food we get in England is so different from what we get here. I am loving the variety of curries found in different cities. Also, bhindi masala is definitely one of my favourites,” says Pat.

On the map A documentary, directed by David Campbell, is being made on their journey (the couple is travelling with a filming crew).

Clothing giant Ralph Lauren is backing the cause by donating T-shirts from the company’s Earth Polo range — a collection of clothes made from thread procured from recycled plastic bottles and dyed using waterless process.

In the second leg of their journey, the couple will travel to Kolkata, Dhanbad, Bodh Gaya, Patna, Varanasi, Lucknow, Agra, New Delhi, Jaipur, Udaipur, Ahemdabad and Mumbai

The car underwent several modifications to suit the Indian roads before being shipped to India. “To ensure that the car rode easily over speed breakers we had to increase the ground clearance by 50 mm and get it to over 170 mm. Initially, the footplate of the car was covered with carpet, we got this changed and fixed metal footplate to help us through the dusty roads” explains Alan.

Alan has deep-rooted connections with India. His grandmother was born in Mysuru, and his grandparents got married in Mumbai. His mother was born in Belgavi and his parents wed in Shimla. “In 2017, we were driving from Belgavi after seeing his mother’s house, when we heard about the Bengaluru-chapter of Harley Davidson riders on an expedition. Alan looked at me and said, “India needs to hear the roar of a Morgan”. I did not take him seriously back then because we did not even own a Morgan, but once we got back Suffolk he bought the car in 2018 and began planning the tour.

414,2020/02/14,‘One should be penalised for not building green’,"Mahesh Ramanujam, President & CEO, USGBC, spoke to M.A. Siraj on the sidelines of the Greenbuild India 2020 conclave. Excerpts:

On the origin and objectives of USGBC

The US Green Building Council (USGBC) emerged from conversations among three individuals - Mike Italiano, David Gottfried, and Rick Fedrizzi - that began in 1993. It revolved round promoting sustainability in building design, construction and operation. Their concern was how to reduce carbon emission. Until 1998 we did not define the system. It took six to seven years to develop LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) rating system for buildings. It is like a nutrition label for buildings, akin to calorie chart on foodstuffs.

How has been the progress of the movement?

Today, over one lakh projects in 176 countries with over two billion sq. m space are following LEED specification. United States is of course the leading market. China comes next, followed by Canada and India. In the US, 32 municipalities, 15 States and 400 agencies have mandated LEED as a guideline and requirement for development. We recently analysed the performance of the first 25 years of LEED. Today 100 cities around the world are LEED-certified. Surat is the first in India in this group.

Buildings alone will not count. The human health should be the foremost concern. Communities, neighbourhoods, and cities too need to be measured and rated for safety, sustainability, inclusivity, equity, health & wellness, resilience and economic prosperity standards. For these to happen, the Master Plans have to be strong. Look at Delhi, it has turned into a gas chamber. An average individual in that city inhales hazardous air equal to smoking 50 cigarettes in a day. Goal no. 11 in the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN seeks sustainable development of cities and communities.

Any policy imperatives for India?

In India the LEED is still a voluntary benchmark, not mandatory. The system needs to make a transit from incentive to penalty. One should be penalised for not building green. Perhaps more property tax may be levied for not incorporating green norms.

India has leapfrogged in several sectors. Mobile telephony now connects 800 million people. Delhi Metro is a great success story with 554-km network in 20 years. It is going for the 4th phase. It is being replicated in Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kolkata. International airports in Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Delhi are LEED-certified buildings. All these are ample proof that things can happen if there is a will.

There is a need for awareness. Teak smells good and looks shiny when varnished in red and burgundy hues. But one must know that it emits fumes from formaldehyde which is injurious to health. One needs to know from where the power comes, from a renewable source or dirty grid where coal is burnt. Energy audit ought to be implemented.

On TRUE (Total Resource Use Efficiency) initiative

It is a new initiative by the USGBC which enables facilities to define, pursue and achieve zero waste goals, cutting carbon footprint and supporting health. TRUE is aimed at changing how materials flow through society, resulting in waste. It encourages the redesign of resource life cycles so that all products are reused and waste is minimized. There are 400 ongoing projects under this around the world.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/one-should-be-penalised-for-not-building-green/article30824026.ece
415,2020/02/14,‘Buildings should breathe’,"Experts urge incorporation of sustainability aspects right from the drawing board. By M.A. Siraj

Buildings should be breathing structures, not merely physical structures. The people living or working inside the buildings are more important than the structure and it is their lives that matter. Better buildings equal better lives. Green buildings are the ones that consume less energy and water, use natural light and air, generate and send out least waste, harvest rainwater, recycle and upcylce wastewater. These concepts should be incorporated in the planning stage and need integrated effort from developers, architects, project engineers and all other stakeholders.

Consensus revolved round these concepts at the Greenbuild India 2020 conclave in Bengaluru which brought builders, developers, architects and engineers together to discuss the sustainability aspects of construction and buildings.

Opening the conference, Mahesh Ramanujam, President and CEO, US Green Building Council (USGBC), said climate change does not spare anyone, not even those who contribute the least carbon to the atmosphere. “Africa is the least emitter of carbon, yet the most affected. Stakes are high, but so are the opportunities. Builders are required to take the green concepts from awareness to adoption.”

Ramanujam said urbanisation cannot be reversed and so sustainability aspects should be incorporated at every stage of development in order to maintain and safeguard living standards. “People, planet and profit”, he said, “constitute a triangle and every single among them is integral to the other”.

Scot Horst, CEO of Arc Skoru Inc., the company that was formed to support the USGBC, said, “Our focus at Arc is a score that allows everyone to compare how they are doing relative to themselves and to all others at a global scale”. Quoting studies he said humans added 475 million tonnes of carbon in the atmosphere during 2017 alone.

Speaking at a panel discussion on “Green Homes in India”, architect and Director, Environmental Design Solutions, Tanmay Tathagat, said the first 2,000 green homes were constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) under a Lucknow Development Authority project which got ready for occupation last month.

Shabbir Kanchwala, Vice-President, Raheja Group, said the rating system for green homes needed specific adaptation norms for India.

Sanjeev Saxena, Vice-President (Technical), DLF, said sustainability practices at the DLF’s 760-apartment complex ‘The Crest’ in Gurugram (which has been certified Gold LEED), has led to 10 to 15% reduction in power consumption and 30 to 50% reduction in water consumption. The project, with a 2.3 mn.sq.ft area, incorporated solar water heaters, rainwater harvesting, centralized STP and water chilling water system. Irrigation of the surrounding gardens and cooling towers within the complex were entirely done by the recycled wastewater. The complex also introduced shuttle bus service to the nearest Metro and bus station in order to reduce the overall carbon footprint. “The DLF is now partnering with EV-charging experts to cover the 100% parking space in the basement as EV is the fuel for the future”, Saxena added.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/nueymo/article30824014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15bgpsiraj1DSC1536JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/buildings-should-breathe/article30824015.ece
416,2020/02/14,ICMR-aided project to eradicate oral cancer among Narikuravars,"Indian Council of Medical Research allocates ₹14 lakh for the initiative

The Indira Gandhi Institute of Dental Sciences (IGIDS), Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth, has initiated an oral cancer eradication project funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research, for Narikuravar tribal population.

The Model for Oral Cancer Eradication (MOCE) project for prevention and screening of oral pre-cancer and cancer among Narikurava tribal population aims to design and test a cost-effective sustainable model for screening among the Narikurava population in and around the region.

The ICMR has allocated ₹14 lakh for the project, which has a three-year timeframe.

“We are launching the project among the target community in the city. We will later expand the scope of intervention to Narikuravars in Villupuram and Cuddalore,” said M. Senthil, professor and team leader, Public Health Dentistry, at IGIDS.

There are an estimated 150 Narikuravar families in the Lawspet settlement.

Doctors pointed out that oral cancer indices and mortality show major differences worldwide, but the highest incidence and prevalence are noted in India and neighbouring countries, where it ranks among the top three types of cancer.

The real challenge in oral cancer lies in early diagnosis and prevention. Widening inequities in oral health status and treatment needs exist among different social groupings. Groups of people even today live in isolation either geographically or socially with their traditional values and beliefs.

They are commonly referred to as tribal population and are considered to be the autochthonous (indigenous) people of the land and the Narikurava tribal community is indigenous to Tamil Nadu.

Common issues

They face common but consequential issues like poverty, illiteracy, communication problems, poor healthcare and social discrimination. A preliminary survey on oral health status and awareness about the oral hygiene measures of Narikuravar tribes, found that their oral health knowledge and status was very poor and needed greater attention of dentists.

This population also does not avail oral health services and tends to follow the traditional indigenous way of cure. Till date no data is available on the prevalence of oral cancer among this special population.

A study a while ago reported that Narikurava women had low rates of allopathic healthcare utilisation as they face stigma and discrimination while accessing healthcare.

There was also wide long-term use of smokeless tobacco both among males and females equally. Considering this, the prevalence of cancerous, or at the least precancerous lesions are expected to be high is this group, Dr. Senthil said.

M.O.H.F. Shahjahan, Transport Minister, recently launched the initiative, which is headed by Sivaramakrishnan Muthanandam, associate professor from Department of Oral Pathology & Microbiology, IGIDS.

Jananni Muthu, Vezhavendan N. and Suganya M. are co-investigators in the MOCE project.

Bruno, managing trustee, Samugam Trust, Gopal Pillai, Chairman, Mother’s Trust, NGO, Santha Devy, Vice-Principal, IGIDS, and Arun Varghese, a representative from Tamil Nadu IDA branch, also participated.

While Dr. Muthanandam explained the basis and aim of the programme, Mr. Bruno and Mr. Gopal Pillai emphasised the importance of the screening project.

A team comprising dentists and interns from IGIDS has started preliminary screening for oral cancer among a small group of the population.

The drive is being coordinated by M. Kishore, field coordinator. The screening programme for oral cancer detection and prevention will be conducted every Thursday by the team at the Narikuravar Colony, Lawspet.

Investigators believe that the results of the project will facilitate designing a sustainable, feasible cost-effective screening model for oral cancer. They also feel that there is scope for expansion of this model into other oral health care sectors and upscaling it for screening the population in other healthcare areas as well.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/83tilj/article30824574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15PONDYCANCER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/icmr-aided-project-to-eradicate-oral-cancer-among-narikuravars/article30824575.ece

The Madras High Court on Thursday reserved its judgment on a writ petition filed by Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy challenging an advisory issued by the Centre last month for continuing the practice of transferring cash instead of free distribution of rice to ration card holders.

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan deferred his verdict after hearing elaborate arguments advanced by senior counsel A.R.L. Sundaresan and T.R. Rajagopalan for the petitioner, Additional Solicitor General G. Rajagopalan for the Centre and senior counsel A.L. Somayaji representing Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi.

While the Chief Minister asserted that the decision to distribute free rice was backed an unanimous resolution passed by the Legislative Assembly, the Centre questioned the very maintainability of the case and claimed that the Chief Minister of a Union Territory was not entitled to file a case against the Centre since both of them were not distinct entities.

419,2020/02/14,Five held for murder of petrol bunk manager in Villupuram,"Victim was killed in a case of mistaken identity

The Villupuram town police on Thursday arrested five persons in connection with the murder of a petrol bunk manager at Thiru Nagar near here on February 4. The arrested were identified as Raghu, Muthukumar, Damodaran, Arockiaraj and Cyril.

Police said the victim S. Srinivasan, a resident of Panruti in Cuddalore, who was working as a manager at the fuel station, was murdered by the gang in a case of mistaken identity.

The petrol bunk owner Prakash was the real target of the gang.

According to a senior police official, a gang led by Azhar, a historysheeter, attempted to extort money from Mr. Prakash last year. When he refused to heed to the demand, the gang created a ruckus inside the pump and attempted to hurl country-made bombs at his house. However, it turned out to be his neighbour’s house.

Azhar and his associates were arrested by the police on a complaint lodged by Mr. Prakash. The gang decided to take revenge and planned to murder him. A gang led by Muthukumar reached the petrol pump in a car on February 4 and enquired whether the bunk’s owner was available in his cabin.

When employees said he was present in the cabin, the gang rushed into his office and hurled three country-made bombs at Srinivasan, who was the only person in the cabin.

The assailants later attacked him with weapons, killing him on the spot. The accused were produced before a local court and remanded in custody.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/five-held-for-murder-of-petrol-bunk-manager-in-villupuram/article30814682.ece
420,2020/02/14,"Closure of Pondhicherry Cooperative Sugar Mill leaves staff, farmers in a spot","Difficulties for the cooperative undertaking started in 1994, aggravated in 2011-12 and the unit was finally shut down in 2017

The closure of Pondhicherry Cooperative Sugar Mill has put a question mark over the future of around 300 workers.

With accumulated losses running to around ₹150 crore, the management shut down the operations in March 2017. The workers have been without salary for the last 37 months. The employees used to earn between ₹27,000 to ₹30,000 a month, said Sankaralingam, a retired employee and a resident of Kombakkam. Mr. Sankaralingam, who retired in 2018, is yet to get his retirement benefits.

According to Madhavan, an aggrieved employee, at least 100 workers were solely dependent on the salary they earned from the mill and were now pushed to penury.

“Closure may not have affected many of the workers whose spouse or children are employed. But life has become an everyday struggle for sole breadwinners like me since the closure of the mill,” he said. He said most workers were aged above 50 and were not skilled to take up any other job. “Some of them have become farmhands but they too find it difficult to get daily work,” he added.

V. Shankar, secretary of Pondicherry Farmers’ Forum, said farmers in Puducherry were at a loss due to government’s decision to wind up operations. Since the closure of the mill, farmers in Nettapakkam, Embalem, Thirubhuvanai, Mangalam, Mannadipet, Villianur and Ossudu were forced to sell sugar cane to private mills at Nellikuppam and Mundiampakkam in Tamil Nadu. These mills paid low price to farmers in Puducherry, he said and added that the private mills left out a good portion of the sugar cane.

“That never used to happen when our mill was functioning. The government should take an immediate decision, particularly taking into account the condition of workers,” Mr. Shankar said. According to a union leader of the mill, the decline of the mill started from 1994 and it started aggravating in 2011-12.

Ten years ago, the mill used to crush 3.25 tonnes of sugar cane every year. When it was closed in 2017, the quantum of sugar cane crushed came to around 60,000 tonnes, he added. Mismanagement, coupled with lack of grant-in-aid from the government, led to the present condition of the mill, said S. Ramamurthy, president of Pondicherry Farmers’ Association.

The cooperative sugar mill in Lingareddipalayam in Mannadipet has been a source of revenue to farmers of not only Puducherry but also of neighbouring Tamil Nadu villages. This is the only mill in cooperative sector and was started after much struggle and consistent efforts by the territorial administration.

‘No justification’

There can be no justification whatsoever for the neglect of the mill which was making good profits and as a result of its good performance, the government even started a school called PONCOS. It is indeed a sorry spectacle that the mill was not functioning now, said S. Nadarajan, a resident of Ambalathadayar Madam Street.

“It is a major undertaking of the territorial government. Proper planning is needed to revive the mill and any plan to shift the administration to any other source would cause havoc and will defeat the spirit of cooperative movement. Next to paddy, sugar cane cultivation is a major farming activity in Puducherry and hence this rich potential should be fully utilised and effective planning is needed to revive the mill,” said S. Kasthuri, a resident of Kirumampakkam.

A senior official told The Hindu that the government had taken several steps to revive the mill. “The call to operate the mill as a public sector undertaking or under private partnership mode will be finally taken by the Cabinet,” the official said.

In the last few months, the government has cleared pending arrears of ₹6 crore to sugar cane farmers. A sum of ₹6.5 crore has been paid to the EPF as employer share and ₹2 crore to LIC for providing gratuity to the employees under a special scheme.

“We are trying to reduce the liabilities before taking a final call on the operationalisation of the mill,” he added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/vltkqv/article30814659.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13FEBTHPY11SUGARCANECUTTING8,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/closure-of-sugar-mill-leaves-staff-farmers-in-a-spot/article30814661.ece

423,2020/02/14,The many languages of theatre,"The play Bhaskara Pattelarum Thommiyude Jeevithavum, a ‘jolting experience’: actor Nasser

The stage adaptation of Malayalam author Paul Zacharia’s novella, Bhaskara Pattelarum Ente Jeevithavum, an unsettling examination of the master-slave power dynamic set the tone for the 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav parallel theatre festival hosted by the National School of Drama at Adishakti.

‘Bhaskara Pattelarum Thommiyude Jeevithavum’, the opening act of the week-long festival, was directed by Suveeran and performed by Kozhikode-based Back Stage. The play is based on Thommy, a Christian migrant labourer from Kerala, who becomes an obedient slave of his aggressive, tyrannical landlord Bhaskara Pattelar.

There is apparently no limit to Thommy’s loyalty and servitude to his master, even if it is to make his own wife sexually submit to his master.

Whenever Thommy is torn about owning up to the fact that his master is a ruthless fiend, he seeks self-justification in how his own life improved on the basis of servitude, to remain as loyal as ever. Even though he has regard for Pattelar’s wife Saroja, he eventually helps his master kill her on a pact that he would testify that the shot was fired by mistake.

When the consequences of his misdeeds catch up with Pattelar, master and slave flee into the jungles. As the power structures that once dictated their relationship disintegrate during the journey, Pattelar sees Thommy as an ally more and more, eating from the same leaf, even calling him by name.

In the closing scene where avengers shoot down Pattelar, Thommy breaks down... but even in that moment of freedom from tyranny, he is repentant of how he once betrayed his master.

Actor M. Nasser, who was theguest of honour, remarked that the play was a “jolting experience”.

“I initially tried to track the little Malayalam words I knew, but soon gave up and just surrendered to the show.

424,2020/02/14,NSD’s Bharat Rang Mahotsav kicks off,"The week-long theatre festival will feature five Indian and two foreign plays

When actor-director M. Nasser declared his compelling body of work as film actor to be of no greater value than the accomplishments of a stage artiste, the theatre buffs in the arena might have thought he was merely reading the room than being a straight shooter.

“I truly feel I am in no way greater than a theatre artiste who takes the stage in any village far or near,” the veteran actor told an audience of theatre buffs gathered at the Adishakti for the launch and opening act of the 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav’s parallel theatre festival hosted by the National School of Drama.

“Deep in my heart, I want to be on stage,” remarked the man who rules South Indian cinema as one of its foremost critically acclaimed actors, while removing any lingering doubts that he meant what he said. He recounted how he had sent his son for a workshop at Adishakti to pick up acting chops and the experience was life-changing for the young man. “I’ll live my life as an actor but I will never act in films,” his son had told him.“As an art form, theatre has seen all the trends which come and go but it is still growing and maintaining its legacy among the generations. Stages like BRM are providing individuals with access to some uncommon dramatic experiences”.

It is important to take theatre seriously, especially at a time when India is changing rapidly and digital forms predominated entertainment. “Theatre is people’s art whether it is folk, contemporary or experimental and where the artiste and the audience are engaged in face-to-face communication,” Mr. Nasser said.

He concluded with a call for hosting more such festivals to bring back glory to the art of theatre.

Ashwani Kumar, Chief Secretary, underscored the challenge of reviving the fading forms of folk arts and theatre and making them relevant as he recalled watching ‘nautanki’ folk operatic theatre in his childhood days.

“The motto behind such festivals is to represent theatre as an aspect rooted in local societies, which lays the foundation on which the theatre practitioners perform. We are delighted that the National School of Drama is giving a platform to the youth to pursue their dreams,” the Chief Secretary said. Arjun Deo Charan, NSD acting chairman, said, Indian theatre tradition drew from the Natyasastra treatise, which classified the four types of abhinaya as ‘angika’ (body movement), ‘vachika’ (dialogue), ‘aaharya’ (costumery) and ‘saattvika’ (emoting).

He pointed to the Hanuman Natak, an early form of theatre, as personifying the actor-character duality where Raavan on assuming the identity of Ram to trick Sita, finds that all lust has dissolved and is overcome by virtuousness when he becomes the character.

“Theatre brings meaning to people and the position of an actor is held highly in our country. An actor should be mindful of their own emotions and the emotions of their character. The NSD brings out the best in actors, while at the same time giving audiences a chance to appreciate world class theatre through festivals like BRM.”

Wider reach

Suresh Sharma, director in-charge, National School of Drama, while appreciating artistes from the national and international theatre fraternity, said, “The idea of BRM is to reach out to a much wider set of audiences with works from modern and regional theatre. We hope to highlight the importance of theatre and plays and promote the culture of appreciating various forms of performing arts.”

Abhilash Pillai, Dean (Academics), NSD, also addressed the audience.

428,2020/02/14,Official asked to go on compulsory leave,"Regional Joint Director of Collegiate Education, Tiruchi, S. Usha, was on Friday instructed by the Director of Collegiate Education to go on compulsory leave following complaints from employees about her ‘unbecoming behaviour.’

An official order said that Prof. Usha had caused ‘mental agony’ by using ‘unparliamentary words and causing physical hurt’ to some employees. The employees complained to the Director of Collegiate Education that she was in the habit of not signing files from colleges in time, and thereafter holding them responsible for the delay by demanding apology letters.

Another order was issued appointing P. Cynthiya Selvi, Principal of Government Women's College, Kumbakonam, as RJD in-charge with financial power, until further notice.

Earlier, about 200 members of Aided College Teachers’ Association staged an agitation in front of the office of the RJD in Tiruchi expressing resentment over the functioning of Prof. Usha.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/official-asked-to-go-on-compulsory-leave/article30823351.ece
429,2020/02/14,Tiruchi ignored,"City residents have expressed dismay over the absence of any announcement with respect to establishment of an integrated bus stand in Tiruchi in the State budget. The absence of any mention on the long-pending demand for establishing an integrated bus stand in Tiruchi was a big let-down, they felt.

Despite repeated promises by the corporation and the State government, a plan for an integrated bus stand has not been finalised for over 25 years. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, while taking part in the MGR centenary celebration in Tiruchi in 2017, announced that an integrated bus stand would be established at Kottapattu. However, the project did not materialise, pointed out M. Sekaran, president, Federation of Consumer and Service Organisations. ‘The city is represented by two ministers, and several MLAs and MPs. Why have they not pushed for it,’ he wondered.

A step-motherly treatment has been meted out to the city some said. Former Chief Minister MGR toyed with an idea of making the city a second capital. But now elected representatives have failed to represent the issue. Temporary bus stands being established during every festival season has become a permanent feature over the past five years, said H.Ghouse Baig, a civic activist.

N. Ramakrishnan, another civic activist, said following the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, the city has seen no improvement. ‘The focus is on Madurai, Salem and Chennai. Tiruchi has been ignored. We recently got 10 new buses but the need is for a bigger bus stand for these buses to ply,’ he said.

Meanwhile, he had written to the Chief Minister on Thursday recommending three projects - a zoological park similar to the Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai, extension of the Tropical Butterfly Conservatory at Srirangam to accommodate aquatic plants and animals and a tropical flower and herbal park at Kambarasampettai for beautification and increasing of research prospects in the city.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/tiruchi-ignored/article30822920.ece
430,2020/02/14,Budget: farmers disappointed,"Farmers’ organisations are disappointed with the State budget in view of lack of an announcement on crop loan waiver and increase in paddy procurement price. They have expressed concern over the government move to fund a lift irrigation scheme in Salem district by tapping surplus flow in Mettur Dam.

“We were looking forward to this year’s budget with a lot of expectations. We were expecting the government to announce a substantial incentive to increase the paddy procurement price to ₹2,500 a quintal. We were expecting waiver of all crop loans up to ₹2 lakhs sanctioned by cooperative societies and commercial banks. The budget has been a big disappointment on these counts,” said P.R.Pandian, president, Tamil Nadu Federation of All Farmers’ Association.

He sought an explanation from the government why there was no assurance in the policy note on enacting a law to implement its decision to declare the Cauvery delta as a protected agricultural zone. The allocation of less than ₹70 crore for desilting work in Cauvery delta is shocking. A separate government order should be issued for carrying out the desilting work. He, however, welcomed the allocation of funds for executing the Cauvery-Gundar inter-linking scheme.

Expressing concern over “insufficient allocation” of funds for irrigation schemes, Arupathi Kalyanam, general secretary, Federation of Farmers’ Associations of Delta Districts, said most of the schemes would remain on paper with meagre allocation. Though the government has announced a renovation and modernisation scheme on Grand Anicut Canal, ₹300 crore has been allotted this year for the project which is estimated to cost ₹2,298 crore. “Any such project taken up in a phased manner or piece meal basis will not be effective. Such projects should be completed within a year or two,” he said.

He condemned the proposal to divert flood surplus water from the Mettur Dam to tanks in Salem district at an estimated cost of ₹565 crore. “The project is totally against the riparian rights of the Cauvery delta. The final award of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal does not allow lift irrigation even in a single acre either in Tamil Nadu or Karnataka. We get surplus flows hardly for 10 to 15 days in a year and it is totally wrong to execute a project based on this,” he said.

On increasing the incentive for paddy, he urged the government to sanction ₹5,000 an acre as incentive for two seasons a year and transfer the money to farmers’ accounts directly.

P.Ayyakannu, president, Desiya Thennindia Nadigal Innaippu Vivasayigal Sangam, expressed disappointment over lack of announcement on loan waiver as farmers had suffered heavy losses due to drought like conditions in 2016. “We wanted loans of all farmers be waived. There is nothing much to protect the interest of farmers. The government has allotted a mere ₹70 crore for desilting works in the delta.” he said.

While allocation of funds for the Cauvery-Gundar link scheme is welcome, it is regrettable that the government has not sanctioned the long pending demand for the Cauvery-Ayyaru-Upparu linking scheme. However, the president of the farmers wing of the Tamil Maanila Congress Puliyur A.Nagarajan termed it as a farmers’ budget and welcomed allocation of funds for schemes such as Cauvery-Gundar linking and the Athikadavu-Avinashi irrigation scheme.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/budget-farmers-disappointed/article30822708.ece
431,2020/02/14,Trains in the newly electrified Thanjavur-Tiruvarur broad gauge section can now operate,"The Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS), Southern Circle, Bengaluru, has given statutory clearance for passenger and freight train services on this section

The Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS), Southern Circle, Bengaluru, has given statutory clearance for operation of electric locomotive hauled passenger and freight train services on the newly-electrified Thanjavur-Tiruvarur broad gauge section.

The authorisation from K.A. Manoharan, the CRS, came a few days ago after the officer conducted an inspection on January 31 on the nearly 55-km Thanjavur - Tiruvarur electrified stretch followed by a speed trial by travelling on board a special train hauled by an electric locomotive.

The CRS has given a set of stipulations to be adhered to by the railway administration. This includes a direction to operate freight trains for a period of one week prior to introducing passenger trains so that the operation and working of the new installations were established, said an official communication from the CRS to the General, Manager, Southern Railway, the Tiruchi Railway Division and the Central Organisation for Railway Electrification (CORE) which executed the overhead electrification project.

The Railway authorities were directed to put up general “caution notices” regarding danger of high voltage traction wires, at entrances to railway stations. The CRS should also be informed of the date of introduction of electric traction for public carriage of passengers and freight trains on the section.

The Thanjavur - Tiruvarur single line electrification work is part of the Tiruchi - Thanjavur - Tiruvarur-Nagapattinam - Karaikal overhead electrification project being executed in stages by the CORE at a cost of around ₹200 crore. Overhead electrification has already been completed on the double line stretch from Tiruchi to Thanjavur.

A senior CORE official told The Hindu on Friday that power supply from Tangedco to the newly constructed traction sub station at Thanjavur Junction was expected soon. The official said overhead electrification works on the last stretch from Tiruvarur to Karaikal was apace and would be completed before March. Freight and passenger trains from and to the port town of Karaikal were currently being hauled by diesel locomotives.

After completing the electrification works up to Karaikal, CORE would take up overhead electrification on the nearly 10 -km stretch from Nagapattinam to Velankanni.The official said foundation works have already commenced on this section and the electrification was expected to be completed by June.

The Railway Board has also accorded sanction for electrification of the Nidamangalam - Mannargudi stretch falling under the Tiruchi Railway Division.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/trains-in-the-newly-electrified-thanjavur-tiruvarur-broad-gauge-section-can-now-operate/article30818870.ece
432,2020/02/14,World Radio Day: students rule the air waves,"All India Radio Tiruchi Station commemorated World Radio Day by organising special programmes including segments fully run by students of city schools and colleges.

The programmes, scheduled for Thursday, were curated by station director K. Natarajan to encourage students to take an active interest in radio.

World Radio Day is observed to recognise the contribution of the mass communication medium in providing news and entertainment across all strata of society. In this regard, AIR Tiruchi was doing its part in inculcating the medium in young students, who would benefit from it enormously, said Mr. Natarajan.

The day-long celebration was kicked off, with listeners, including Chandrayaan-1 Project Director Mylswamy Annadurai and DMK MP Tiruchi Siva, recalling their association with radio. Engineers, doctors, farmers spoke of how the radio provided them with information.

Students of SBIOA Matriculation and Higher Secondary School organised a two-hour programme from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. where they sang songs in Tamil, Sanskrit, told riddles, jokes, stories and news for children.

Fifty students from LKG to class 9 took part in the programme. “Our school encouraging radio programmes as we organise a ‘radio programme’ where students discuss current affairs, facts for general knowledge and narrate stories through school intercom on a daily basis. We call the radio 'Sangamam FM,"" said a teacher of SBIOA Matriculation and Higher Secondary School.

Mr. Natarajan said radio as a means of communication was still active due to its versatility. “The applications of the medium are innumerable. We have got calls from miners who said that they used AIR to decide on whether they should go to the mine. Students listen to news for competitive exams. Listening benefits memory retention,"" he said.

Students of Urumu Dhanalakshmi College organised a day-long programme of which the 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. slot was broadcast on AIR. “It was a nostalgic experience for students who narrated anecdotes of waking up to the radio singing prayers, watching their parents perform daily chores as the radio played the news,” Mr. Natarajan said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/fi4nc3/article30817283.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY14-RADIODAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/world-radio-day-students-rule-the-air-waves/article30817284.ece

434,2020/02/14,AI Express set to achieve record profit: Chief Executive Officer,"He says Tiruchi is the top destination for the airline in Tamil Nadu

Air India Express, which has been posting profits for the past four consecutive years since 2015-16, expects to achieve a record profit of over ₹500 crore during the current financial year, its Chief Executive Officer K. Shyam Sundar said here on Thursday.

The low cost carrier, a subsidiary of Air India, also expects to cross ₹5,000 crore in operating revenue, for the first time since inception, during the current fiscal.

40% growth

“The airline’s revenue in the first six months of 2019-20 stood at ₹3,124.34 crore and this is a phenomenal growth of 40% over the same period over the previous financial year.

“The half-yearly net profit of the current fiscal was ₹679.8 crore against the ₹177.3 crore registered during the same period the previous year,” Mr. Shyam Sundar said while announcing the launch of flights to Doha, Abu Dhabi and New Delhi from Tiruchi.

The airline’s revenue in the third quarter is also excellent and the operating revenue increased to ₹4,235 crore by the end of December 2019.

During 2018-19, the airline’s revenue was ₹4,171.5 crore and the net profit, ₹168.5 crore.

Air India Express is catering to a niche market and was always looking to expand operations from Tier II or III cities such as Tiruchi and connect them with foreign destinations abroad. “We are here to seize every market opportunity subject to availability of capacity. We are identifying potential routes,” he said.

Fleet augmentation

Any fleet augmentation plans could be finalised only after the disinvestment process is over.

The airline currently operates with a fleet of 25 Boeing 737-800 aircrafts with a seating capacity of 186 -189, he said to a query.

Tiruchi is the top destination for the airline in Tamil Nadu, Mr. Shyam Sundar said and announced the launch of direct flights from the city to Doha and Adu Dhabi and to New Delhi in its summer schedule, effective March 28.

The airline is launching flights to Doha from Tiruchi for the first time while reviving the service to Abu Dhabi, which it had suspended some years back. The Tiruchi-Abu Dhabi-Tiruchi service will operate four times a week and the Tiruchi-Doha-Tiruchi flights will be thrice weekly.

The airline will also launch a Tiruchi-Madurai-New Delhi service, the first service on the route by the airline.

“We are extending the Madurai-New Delhi flights, which have been operating four days a week, to Tiruchi and making it a daily flight,” Mr. Sundar said

The service will also address the city residents’ clamour for increasing domestic air connectivity.

The airline is already operating to Dubai, Sharjah and Singapore from Tiruchi and once the new flights are launched, the airline will be operating 35 flights a week from the city.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/amttvu/article30817270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY14-AIRINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/ai-express-set-to-achieve-record-profit-chief-executive-officer/article30817271.ece
435,2020/02/14,"I was once on the streets, but now my life is great, says Bengaluru FC's Nili","Bengaluru FC’s new signing Nili went from stealing food as a child in Las Palmas to training alongside Messi, Neymar and Suarez at Barcelona. That fairytale didn’t have a happy ending, but the 25-year-old is at peace with himself

The arms of Bengaluru FC’s new signing Francisco Jose Perdomo Borges, commonly known as Nili, are covered in tattoos. There is a lion, to denote that he is the king of the football jungle. A practising Christian, Nili has made space for a couple of Buddha portraits. The number 29 signifies his childhood jersey number.

A grand tattoo of Greek god Zeus, however, stands out as the most significant. “Zeus is for my grandfather, because he is the god of all gods,” Nili says.

It is evident that Nili, born and raised in the Spanish city of Las Palmas, owes a great debt to his grandfather, Rafael Perdomo, who saved him from a tumultuous childhood

“My life as a kid was not easy. My father and mother fought all the time. When I was seven, I moved out with my mother. But she had problems with alcohol and drugs. She used to hit me a lot, so I was forced to live on the streets. I didn’t have any money. I would wander around and peer through house windows. If I saw fruits or food inside, I would steal it. Those were desperate times,” Nili recalls.

Just when his young life was spiralling out of control, his grandfather stepped in. “My grandfather is my angel — he is the most important person in my life. When I was 10, he took me in and cared for me,” Nili says.

To give Nili a positive outlet, Rafael got him to enrol in the Union Deportiva Las Palmas football academy. Nili — a versatile footballer who can play on the wings or in midfield — excelled at the sport and earned a spot in the senior Las Palmas reserves side in 2013.

His big break came three years later, when he joined Barcelona at the age of 22. Nili was now playing alongside the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar, Andres Iniesta and Luis Suarez. “It is a luxury to train with guys like Messi. You can learn so much in every single minute of training. Off the field, Neymar is like me — he likes to have fun. Messi is more quiet and serious,” Nili says.

But the dream move did not last long. Nili managed just a solitary appearance — as a substitute in a Copa del Rey match — before signing with lower division side Albacete Balompie.

Nili, who describes himself as simple small-town boy, could not handle the pressure of expectations at Barcelona. “When I was in Las Palmas, I played football because I loved the sport. In Barcelona, you need to win every single game and every single title. If you miss a pass in Las Palmas, the coach would say, ‘No problem. Keep going. You can do better next time’. In Barcelona, it was different. If you cannot maintain a very high standard, then someone else will take your place,” Nili says.

His short stint at Barca wasn’t all bad. Nili takes great pride in telling the story of how Messi made his grandfather a happy man. “My grandfather, for the first time in his life, travelled from Las Palmas in the Canary Islands to the mainland. He came to see me train. After training, I asked Messi if he could take a photo with my grandfather. Messi readily agreed, and even gave my grandfather his jersey as a gift. That meant the world to me,” Nili says.

In 2018, Nili left Spain to play for Greek side Platanias. A chat with an old friend, Odisha FC striker Aridane Santana, convinced him to make the move to BFC. “Aridane and I played together in Albacete; he also lived in the Canary Islands. We are like brothers. He told me that I should join BFC because they are an established Indian club. He felt I could perform well in the Indian Super League,” Nili says.

These are early days in the Nili-BFC alliance, but the player has already experienced a few highs. Earlier this month, Nili got the chance to travel to Thimphu for an AFC Cup preliminary-stage clash against Paro FC. For Nili, Bhutan felt like his spiritual home. “I have two Buddha tattoos. Bhutan has a rich Buddhist history. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to go to Bhutan. I never thought it would happen. Thailand maybe, but Bhutan… never,” Nili says.

Having overcome the trials and tribulations of the past, Nili is now truly at peace. “I was once out on the streets, but now my life is great. My wife and daughter — they are my main motivation now. Whenever I do something silly, my wife pulls me back on track. You need someone like that in your life to take you in the right direction. My grandfather played that role when I was young. I will do all I can to support my family,” Nili says.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/32pako/article30824546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BFC0179s,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/i-was-once-on-the-streets-but-now-my-life-is-great-says-bengaluru-fcs-nili/article30824547.ece

Francisco Gonzalez scored a timely hat-trick to help 10-man Mohun Bagan dominate Neroca FC by a tennis scoreline (6-2) in an I-League fixture at the Kalyani Municipal Stadium here on Friday. The win helped the former champion pick up its fifth successive win and realise a 11-point lead in (29 points from 12 matches) the current league table.

Adding to Gonzalez’s hat-trick was a contribution each from Francisco Morante, Babacar Diawara and substitute Romario Jesuraj. Neroca FC reduced the margin through goals from Philip Adjah and Subash Singh. Bagan was reduced to 10 men in the 60th minute when Dhanachandra Singh was given marching orders for handling a Ronald Singh effort at the Bagan goalmouth.

Continuing from where it left off in the previous win (1-0) against Punjab FC, Bagan unleashed its attacking efficiency right from the start. Bagan found success in the 11th minute off a set-piece when Gonzalez nodded home Joseba Beitia’s corner. This opened the floodgates for a spate of goals in the next 34 minutes.

Diverting home

Morante was quick to make it 2-0 in the 13th minute when he diverted home a half-volley from Tursunov. As Bagan continued to press for more, the Neroca goal fell once again in the 24th minute; Gonzalez again nodding home off a short chip from Beitia (3-0). After Gonzalez had missed a 26th minute penalty, Diawara made it 4-0 in the 36th. Adjah got a goal against the run of play in the 41st minute to save Neroca from a washout (4-1).

Gonzalez completed his hat-trick in the 45th minute thanks to another nice assist from Beitia (5-1). Subhash added one more to the Neroca tally as the first half ended with seven goals.

439,2020/02/14,Blasters playing for pride,"Take on Bengaluru FC in last home match of the season

There is nothing at stake except pride when Kerala Blasters takes on Bengaluru FC in its last home match of the season in the Hero ISL at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium on Saturday.

The Blues had a measure of the yellow bridge in the five previous meetings between the two sides but Kerala Blasters’ Dutch coach Eelco Schattorie believes he knows the formula to beat Bengaluru.

As coach of NorthEast United last season, Schattorie plotted the downfall of the Blues even without his top players and that has made him firmly believe that he can achieve the same with Kerala Blasters.

Strong mentality

“I know exactly how to beat them and I know where their weakness are. But their strength is that they are a top club. They have been always up there. So structurally they are doing something very well and they have got the right formula. They have a strong mentality. All credit to the coach, for being able to score off some set-pieces. Even when you are not playing well, you win because you score off some set-piece,’’ said the Dutchman on the eve of the match against Bengaluru.

Schattorie stressed that his team will be playing for a win against Bengaluru and said he will put up the best possible line-up for achieving that. The coach said that Barthlomew Ogbeche, who has been in fine form this season scoring 11 goals and providing an assist, will again be the key man for Kerala Blasters against the Blues.

“We are not playing for charity. We are playing professional football and always looking for a win. I will do everything I can to get three points,’’ he said.

Fan support

Despite the huge fan support, Blasters have won just two matches at home and the club will be hoping to sign off the season with a win. Having made the play offs, the visitors, according to their coach Carles Cuadrat expects a tough match from Kerala Blasters.

“We know how good supporters they have. When they are playing the champions, I am sure it will be a great motivation for them to finish the season with a nice game at home and a victory against us. I am expecting a great game like in Chennai. It was a lot of passion, things happening in the stands... It’s great for football and it is going to be exciting,’’ said the coach.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/blasters-playing-for-pride/article30822798.ece

Tall and athletic, Gūmez looks at the mementos from her arduous journey in soccer and life, and smiles. “When I started I was so bad. I’d kick the ball at the goal and it would go anywhere.”

Gūmez spent years playing in local women’s leagues in Buenos Aires province before being signed recently by Villa San Carlos in the first division. Now the 22-year-old forward is awaiting the Argentine Soccer Federation’s decision whether to authorize the signing in a soccer-mad country that has produced some of the world’s greatest stars, from Lionel Messi to Maradona.

Besides soccer fame, Argentina has also become a regional leader in transgender rights. In 2012, it gave people the freedom to change their legal and physical gender without having to undergo judicial, psychiatric and medical procedures.

The federation’s decision on Gūmez could come in days, and in the run-up her cellphone pings constantly with messages from people reaching out to her. While many support her bid to play professional soccer, others contend it is unfair to the non-transgender women in the league.

""The rights of transgender athletes and the social demands to integrate them into competitions challenge and seriously threaten the rights of women in sports,” said Juan Manuel Herbella, a former soccer player who is a sports doctor. “Athletes who were born men, if they maintain their base conditions, start with an enormous advantage.”

Juan Cruz Vitale, the Villa San Carlos coach, rejects the idea that Gūmez would have an unfair advantage.

The coach said she caught his eye with her speed and her scoring in two straight tournaments. But, he said, “If we talk of strength, I have at least five or six girls who are stronger than her. On that side I don’t see that there is an advantage.”

Amid the controversy, Gūmez recalls how at age 10 she began to ask questions. “I realized that I wanted to be a woman because I liked men and I wanted them to see me in another way.”

She said at 13 she told her mother, Caroline, that she was going to lose her only son. She told her- “I want to be a woman and if you don’t accept it, I am going to leave home.”

Though her mother accepted her, Gūmez said she was tormented by discrimination after assuming the gender she identifies with and was on the brink of taking her own life. Then, she found soccer. She started playing in a vacant lot in front of her house next to her neighbors.

""I used it as a therapy - me trying to accept myself,” she told in the house in the suburb of La Plata she shares with her mother and four younger sisters. “There was a mound of emotions that were making me psychologically unwell. I realized that when I play soccer this mound disappeared.”

On her journey she says she has suffered discrimination and complaints about her participation.

One of her worst days came during a lightning tournament. “They put me on defense but I didn’t know how to play well. I put a goal in my own net. When the first half ended I found out the other team had complained that I shouldn’t play because I put them at a disadvantage. They considered my sexuality a disadvantage for them even though I was playing so poorly.”

Gūmez learned to live with the insults from fans and the complaints when at age 18, backed by the law, she got her new identity card.

""Now I had the identity that I saw myself as having. This gave me the confidence to be who I am,” said Gūmez, who has a soccer ball tattooed on her leg and keeps her long hair tied back when she plays.

The requests for interviews she has been getting recently have forced her to alter her routine of soccer training and working shifts as a manicurist and hair-straightener, which she does to make a living while studying nursing.

Villa San Carlos is in last place in the current first division tournament and is fighting to not descend a division.

Argentina’s soccer federation has no regulations about transgender athletes, so doubt remains about what it will say amid the debate over whether transgender women should play in professional women’s leagues.

The federation declined AP requests to comment on Gūmez’s case.

""On the field, you can have speed and strength, but that doesn’t help you if you don’t know how to play football,” Gūmez said. “I always hold up the example of Messi ... He measures 1.6 meters (5 foot, 7 inches) and is the best player in the world.”

She models her play on that of Darţo Benedetto, formerly with Argentina’s Boca Juniors and now with France’s Olympique de Marseille, and Florencia Bonsegundo, who plays with Valencia in Spain.

Some specialists have said that a higher level of testosterone in some transgender women gives them greater muscular power and an advantage in women’s leagues.

The soccer federation’s decision will take into considerations the rules set out by the International Olympic Committee for transgender athletes. In the case of male-to-female transgender athletes they will need to demonstrate that their testosterone level has been below a certain cutoff point for at least one year before their first competition.

Gūmez said she dreams of playing with Boca Juniors, her favorite team, and on the Argentine national team. She says she also hopes she serves as an inspiration for other transgender people who in spite of recent advances still suffer violence and discrimination.

443,2020/02/14,Her point of view,"In her latest book, noted critic Rekha Sethi explores how various hues of feminine sensibility have been put into words by prominent Hindi poetesses

Since time immemorial, patriarchy-fed romantic love usually makes the female body a tantalising object of male erotic fantasy which centres around eyes, lips, hairs, and breasts. Alluring beauty seems to be the tell-tale sign of the women, and the withering of the body pronounces her inevitable doom. Romance is invariably reduced to not more than a burning desire for stunning looks and woman is perceived as the “Lolita” of every man.

The widespread acceptance of single-dimensional female existence that hardly goes beyond the act of matrimony prompted many sensitive women thinkers and poets to search for the new woman who is non-female. They are more than willing to part with their gorgeous appearance. Anne Saxton in her poem, “Consorting with Angels” aspires to abandon her female body at once, “I have no arms and legs/I am all one skin like a fish/I am no more a woman.”

It is a trenchant comment on social norms which noted feminist theorist Marry Carruthers describes as “gynecompiya”, a disease that severely afflicts the ability to recognise the socio-cultural wholeness of women. People tend to believe that women cannot cohere themselves and their lives have always been imagined in the framework of the relationship with men as the daughter, mother, beloved and women also provide emotional, spiritual and psychological solace in the form of the goddess and Sybil. The terrifying and inevitable predicament of women is central to the creative expression of women.

A discerning critic Rekha Sethi explores how it is mirrored in the poems and how various hues of feminine sensibility have been put into words by prominent Hindi poetesses. In her, astutely written book, “Istri Kavita: Pakshand Paripeksh"" (Women’s poetry: Point of view and Perspective) that has been published by Rajkamal recently, Rekha tries to spell out the contours of the contemporary Hindi feminist poetry with a marked sense of critical acuity. Not infrequently the literacy practices and cultural traditions are tacitly used to perpetuate deprivation and dispossession of women, and the debate on feminist poetry betrays a kind of solipsism and upending of gender and cultural hierarchies. For many critics, feminist discourse draws its sustenance from a theory of victimisation.

Armed with a profound grounding in feminist poetics, the author seeks to raise questions about deep and ever-changing combinations of suppression, discrimination and inequality through the nuanced prism of seven prominent women poets Gagan Gill, Katyani, Anamika, Savita Singh, Nilesh Raghuvanshi, Nirmal Putul and Susheela Takbhore.Rekha is right to observe that all the poets mentioned above have a different experience of identities while facing the equally stifling cultural hierarchies.

She thought through their poems and meticulously located them in a broader theoretical framework of “Theory of Intersectionality” which Rekha considers quite compatible with the Indian context. The theory expounded by Kimberle Crenshaw(1989) candidly examines how race, gender and other individual traits intersect with another and overlap.

Explaining its relevance to us, the author plausibly argues, “Social study hardly makes gender the sole criterion of inequality. Various forms of violence implicitly constitute our socio-political dynamics: race, gender caste overrun each other with equal intensity. These overlapping trappings bring forth a new idiom of violence and suppression. Gender-fed incongruity provides proper perspective as all the women do not belong to the same class, but intersectionality acquaints with the frame of reference through which we can understand the anguish of inequality and can seek to resolve the social tensions. For Rekha, family leaves one in a quandary as it is the most effective tool of patriarchy, and it is also a testament to social prestige.

To understand how women creatively respond to their immediate and ultimate concerns of life and how they get better of all relationships and triumph over the tradition of romantic love, Rekha opts for close reading of the poems produced by seven poets.

The woman does enjoy polymorphous unity in her life which loses it vitality the moment a relationship is signed off. Much talked about security that relationship offers primarily conceals an embroidery of false promise and it irks a celebrated poet Savita Singh who thinks association produces fragmentation which leads to the diminution. The existence of new women owes to no one, and Savita forcefully asserts, “Mein Kisi Ki Aurat Nahi Hoon/Mein Apni Aurat Hoon/ Mein Kisiki Maar Nahi Saheti/ Aur Mera Parmeshwar Koi Nahi ( I am not someone else's woman/I belong to myself only/I don't tolerate thrashing by someone/ And no one is my God).

Delineating the thematic pattern of Savita’s above-discussed poem and Ananmika's poem “Bhamti Ki Betiyan"" , Rekha remarks that here emerges a new woman who no longer seeks social acceptance through a male or family .""I"" refers to the collective noun and its revolutionary precedent in the history of poetry.

Gagan Gil’s poems betray a new sensibility that seeks refuge in intellectual alienation, dreams and truth and the author wrote incisive and insightful articles on Katyani, Nilesh, Nirmala and Susheela. Perhaps, it is the first profound effort to explicate a credible feminist literary poetics in the Indian context with a marked sense of critical penetration and Rekha Sethi deserves accolades.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/mev2kj/article30817677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sethi,https://www.thehindu.com/books/her-point-of-view/article30817678.ece
444,2020/02/14,The yakshi who ended a war and other stories,"B Prasad’s Yakshikathakal aims to change the popular perception of the mythical beings that populate our films, folklore and literature

In Kerala, the yakshi haunts our collective imagination. These mythical beings of extraordinary beauty, have been represented in films, folkore and literature time and again, with hair as black as midnight and always robed in white, the colour of moonlight.

The stories we have heard of yakshis are those that send shivers down the spine. As legend goes, these yakshis, Kerala’s version of vampires, charm people, mostly men, with their ethereal beauty, before drinking their life blood.

They are, however, very misunderstood, says B Prasad, who has authored a collection of stories, Yakshikathakal, for children. An editor at the Kerala State Institute of Children’s Literature, based in Thiruvananthapuram, he spent a year putting the book together. He says, “We have only heard of them as blood-thirsty beings, who spread fear. But the term yakshi originally could have evolved from the term devi (goddess),” he adds. “Yakshis from folklore are actually women who lived extraordinary lives. They were honest, brave and honourable. From these stories, one can guess that women in those times were respected in society. Women who led exemplary lives were believed to have got another life after their deaths, and they were worshipped in temples.”

Thiruvananthapuram and the southern region of Kerala on the whole, have temples where yakshis have been consecrated. “Though we have all seen them, we hardly know their stories,” says Prasad.

Prasad’s stories have been culled from villadichanpaattu, a musical art form that is common in the Ammankovils (Devi temples) of southern Travancore. The songs in turn have their roots in the thekkanpaattu, an oral musical tradition that captured the life and times of erstwhile Nanchinadu (present Kanyakumari district) and surrounding regions.

Prasad, who belongs to the Vaniya community, which traditionally performs villadichanpattu, was fascinated by the mention of yakshis in some of the songs. He picked up threads that led him to libraries and studies on thekkanpaattu. While research and records on this mostly oral tradition is still scarce, Prasad did find five yakshis whose stories he has compiled in the collection.

The collection, which includes five books, are on Neeli, Ponnirathal, Purushadevi, Chembakavalli and Vadukachiyamma. These women were heroes in their own right, says Prasad. Purushadevi, for instance, was the daughter of the queen of Pennarasunadu, a kingdom ruled by women. When the time came for her to have a baby, the kingdom waited eagerly for the heir to the throne. Soon, Purushadevi became pregnant and her mother orders for a fort to be built around the palace, for protection. This angered the neighbouring king, who waged a war against Pennarasunadu.

In the story, though the women fight valiantly, the neighbouring kingdom joins forces with another kingdom, resulting in a fierce and bloody war. When she learns that it is a losing battle, Purushadevi takes her unborn child after cutting open her belly and throws it at her opponents. This act stuns her enemies and the kings burn in a sense of shame and remorse. They kill themselves on the battlefield.

The stories are essentially sad, speaking of pain, injustice and death. “The songs from which they have been derived are detailed. It was extremely challenging to adapt them for a children’s book. But these stories, I felt, offer a glimpse into the rich and ancient socio-cultural fabric of the past. We had a very colourful oral story-telling history. I have tried to tell the stories simply, glossing over the gruesome details.”

Written in plain sing-song prose, and illustrated brightly, the book is meant for children, though adults would also enjoy the narration and presentation. Prasad chose different illustrators to bring life to his characters. While Manoj Mathasseril, one of the artists, has used the traditional Kerala mural style to bring Chembakavalli and Purushadevi to life, Gopu Pattithara brings the lovely Ponnirathal to life in his distinctive style. K P Muraleedharan’s Neeli and Santhosh Veliyannoor’s Vadukachiyamma are equally attractive, drawing the readers to them at one glance.

“Since these are stories that combine myth and history, there is an element of fantasy in them. Though I’ve used the Kerala mural style, minor deviations had to be made to suit the setting and timeline of the stories,” says Manoj. “I read the stories and developed my drawings accordingly.”

The yakshi meanwhile, would live on, a little more colourful perhaps, in our imagination.

445,2020/02/14,Walking with Salim Ali...,"N Krishna Kumar recalls some of his precious memories of being in the Indian Forest Service and the treks he took with some wildlife greats

“Dr. Salim Ali was a role model,” N. Krishna Kumar IFS (Rtd.) reminisces about his early days at the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) where he started out as a Junior Research Fellow in the 80s. He went on to become the director of the Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding (IFGTB) Coimbatore, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, and Head of Forest Force.

He can’t forget a walk with the bird man. “A team of five or six of us were posted to Point Calimere in Kodiakarai assigned to study bird migration. It was early morning and we walked with him for five kms. I was in awe of the man. But he was mostly silent and meticulously observed the birds. When he did speak to me I got a peek into his extraordinary understanding of nature and I think, more than anything else, I learnt about discipline from him.”

Krishna Kumar has walked with some of the best, he says and acknowledges the valuable lessons he has learnt from them. On a trek with wildlife photographer, writer and naturalist, M Krishnan, he understood the importance of silence, especially in a forest. “The moment we entered a forest, Krishnan would urge us to stay quiet and tread lightly. He said that was the best way to understand Nature.”

On crocodile walks with conservationist Romulus Whitaker, he has collected crocodile eggs. This was the time they were endangered and crocodile banks were started in Tamil Nadu. Whether it was about the behaviour of chitals, sambars, and elephants, he gleaned from ‘elephant doctor’ Dr V Krishnamurthy, or the world of insects he was introduced to by Dr Ananthakrishnan from Loyola Institute of Entomology, Krishna Kumar is grateful for the experiences.

Engaging with Nature is everything, he says, giving the example of the Tamil Nadu Wildlife Youth Club programme where he got the golden opportunity to spend three years exploring sanctuaries and national parks in Tamil Nadu. “I met veteran wildlifers and foresters during those student days, and got an insight into what it would take to enter IFS. I worked towards it and here I am. I wish such programmes were reintroduced. Early introduction to wildlife and nature is important.”

New role Krishna Kumar is the Tamil Nadu president of the Organisation for Industrial, Spiritual and Cultural Advancement (OISCA). OISCA advocates and implements sustainable development programmes among young people. “It is spread across 65 countries. They believe Mother Earth should not be disturbed. The objective is to get children to understand the value of Nature, and motivate them to protect her. OISCA promotes organic farming, children forestry programmes and other projects aimed at introducing Nature to school children. Under the UN programme, there are 17 sustainable development goals. India and 130 countries are signatories. Climate change is a big threat, we have to make the future generation understand the impact and look for solutions.”

His informed work on butterflies is greatly respected today. “My thesis was on ecology and conservation of selected Papilionidae butterflies in the Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary in the Anamalais. My recommendations on tracking and monitoring butterflies and on the inventory of host plant status are still being implemented as are my points on conservation education, training, and creation of conservation networks,” he says.

As the director of Vandalur Zoo, (he held the post for six years), he set up the butterfly conservation centre and park at the Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Vandalur in 1997. “We nurtured over 80 host plants that attracted butterflies. Zoos are not just about exhibiting large, beautiful and fancy animals, it is about the smaller species too. That’s why I set up an insectarium and a herpetarium.” Krishna Kumar started the Zoo School. “School children were brought to the zoo and told about the animals, birds and insects. They were encouraged to treat other creatures with respect and sensitivity. We inculcated those values in children.”

Taking flight Krishna Kumar says migratory birds descend in huge numbers — red shanks, little shanks, cormorants, teals and geese. “We set up small traps for waders and terrestrial birds in the evenings. The following morning we measure the wing span, beak span, weight, and length of the legs of the bird before attaching an aluminium ring with a number inscribed on it, round their legs before setting them free on their way to Siberia, Russia and Ukraine. There was no GPS then , but after a month or so, we would get a call or a letter saying ‘Your bird (BNHS ring no..) has landed in Siberia’. We received details of the date, the body weight of the bird and other details. We could then tell if the bird had lost or gained weight during its flight...”

“Every single day of my 36 years amidst wildlife and forest has been rewarding,” says Krishna Kumar who has specialised on forest genetic resources. “In India, we have 2600 species of trees and in the world there are over a lakh, but we know very little about them. Every tree is individual. Its genetic make up decides its longevity, adaptability to climate and so on. If we do not preserve this genetic information, we will lose the trees. In the era of climate change, we have to understand Nature better. Conservation of forest genetic resources therefore is important.”

He shares one more special memory about Dr Salim Ali and that walk: “I held out a copy of Handbook of Indian Birds to him. He signed it and gave it back to me. It made my day.”",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ibaghh/article30820842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KRISHNAKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/n-krishna-kumar-recalls-his-days-in-the-indian-forest-service-and-the-treks-he-took-with-the-wildlife-greats/article30820846.ece
446,2020/02/14,Great Backyard Bird Count 2020 comes to Kerala capital,"If you work or live on campus, you could also participate in the Campus Bird Count that is conducted simultaneously with the backyard bird count

If you enjoy birds of the feathered kind, here is your opportunity to be a part of the Great Backyard Bird Count 2020, an all-India activity covering four days that began on Friday.

In addition, if you work or live on campus, you could also participate in the Campus Bird Count that is conducted simultaneously with the backyard bird count. As of now, one of the campuses registered from Thiruvananthapuram is the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research- Thiruvananthapuram (IISER-TVM) at Vithura. Eight other campuses from Kerala are also participating in the count.

Hema Somnathan, Professor of Ecology at IISER who is coordinating the count on the campus, says there is an active group of birders on the campus and so around 100 of them would be participating in the count on Sunday and Monday.

“We have forested areas on our campus and we would be covering the Jersey Farm in the vicinity too. This is a global event covering 80 countries that is coordinated by Cornell University. So once the count is over, we will be sending the event organisers, eBird, the number of birds and the species we saw during the exercise. The aim is to document the diversity of the avian population. Eventually, we might bring out an e-publication of the birds on our campus,” she explains.

eBird, a global online platform for documenting and maintaining observations of birds, is housed in Cornell University’s Laboratory of Ornithology. By collating the date, eBird helps us understand the distribution of birds and makes this available for public use.

On the spot Well-known birder Suresh Elamon lists some of the common birds found in almost every backyard in the district in addition to crows.

Different kinds of woodpeckers, kingfisher, crow phesant, white-cheeked barbet, Magpie Robin, Indian cuckoo, shikra, Drongo, Treepie, pigeons, Indian Mynah, Sunbirds, Indian barn owl, spotted owlet and more.

Birds counts help in studying how birds are distributed across the country and understand if there are changes in their movements or living patterns. This can be used to find out how changes in environment affect the birds. eBirds also views the entire exercise as a way to get more people involved in birding.

“This is the time when we also spot a number of migratory birds in different places in the city. For instance, in my house in Peroorkada, I was able to see the Black-naped Oriole, the grey wagtail and the Ashy drongo. Beginners should start at the crack of dawn to watch these birds in our backyard and garden. By 8 am, most of the birds would have left,” explains Sushant, a keen birder and coordinator of Warblers and Waders.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/bvf5po/article30819877.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15TVMSUNBIRD,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/great-backyard-bird-count-2020-comes-to-kerala-capital/article30819878.ece

448,2020/02/14,"Meet Sumair, the teen environmentalist who wants to save India’s marine life","Sumair Handa Bakshi from Delhi of Save The Spirit Of The Sea talks about his 2020 campaign and upcoming film about saving the Ganges, which are supported by Yuvraj Singh and Hazel Keech

“I believe that activism is more than just talking about issues that are prevalent in society,” starts Sumair Handa Bakshi, “but actually working on them and engaging others to start contributing efforts towards making a change, that too in a continuous manner. In a sense, we want Save The Spirit Of The Sea to be an organisation run by the youth and owned by the youth.”

Turning points December 18, 2015: “We got a petition signed by locals of Delhi and held a peaceful protest outside the Japanese Embassy, New Delhi against their Taiji Dolphin Slaughter. This was our first official event and we were joined by at least 50 people and three vans of police who were under the impression that a full fledged protest was about to be conducted. Nevertheless, each person who attended the protest and signed the petition had engaged with a cause of great importance.”

October 2019: “I attended a beach clean up organised by the Earth Day Network at Juhu Beach in Mumbai and I was later awarded an Earth Day Network Rising Star for my efforts towards conservation.”

December 2019: “I gave a TEDxYouth talk ‘Traditions and Conservation’ about the dualities of environmental conservation and maintaining customs and traditions.”

Recently, the Delhi-based social enterprise went viral for their January 15 cleanup of Kalindi Kunj Yamuna Ghat in Delhi which will feature in an upcoming film by the team. Let’s dial it back, though; eight years ago Save The Spirit Of The Seas started as nothing more than a website that Sumair designed for himself, along with social media. The core idea at the time was to engage his peers about the under-discussed causes in society. Fast forward to the present and Save The Spirit of The Sea is a 15-strong team and is a registered organisation as a Section 8 Company.

Sixteen-year-old Sumair and his team are particularly looking forward to their latest project: ‘Save The Spirit of The Ganga’, to be launched officially in April with a short film, which is yet to be named.

Production included a lot of on-location shooting, including a trip to Bihar to film in Vikramshila, Bhagalpur. This marked a special moment for Sumair who says they were blessed to be able to see and film dolphins in the Ganges river. “There isn’t much of a spotlight upon these creatures and most people don’t even know about their existence. The aim of our film of course is to awaken the world about the existence of such incredible species and the reality of their plight, which we witnessed firsthand, due to the pollution present in their habitat.”

Behind the scenes

“We raised ₹10 lakhs and started filming last November. We partnered with the India Film Services to create the first video and are a team of 15 Indians currently.” The project is also partially-backed financially by YouWe Nissan, as well as social support from Yuvraj Singh and Hazel Keech.

Sumair Handa Bakshi and the Save The Spirit Of The Sea team at the Kalindi Kunj Yamuna Ghat cleanup in Delhi

But Sumair is more focussed on the idea of government intervention and the big picture. “This project should catalyse broader and bolder movements by authorities such as the enforcement of laws, and implementation of conservation facilities to help protect the species of the River Ganga ranging from dolphins to sharks to gharials all under severe threat. Through social media and relatable, conscious content we aim for the youth to be able to relate to the cause and the message we are trying to portray. We hope this would be able to leverage human resources through aspects of volunteerism and philanthropy to help increase the platform of the River Ganga.”",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/70q8z7/article30819795.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy14-savespirit-cleanup,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/sumair-handa-bakshi-interview-save-the-spirit-of-the-sea-river-ganges-2020-campaign-and-film/article30819796.ece
449,2020/02/14,This store in Visakhapatnam provides greener alternatives to plastic packaging,"Being mindful of the amount of plastic ending up at the city dump, Asya offers eco-friendly alternatives to packing gifts

Like so many of us, Shaheda Mehdi and Nanditha Kancharla were concerned about all the packaging material from gifts that was eventually dumped. What made it worse were these were usually plastic waste.

Something had to be done about that, they decided and in September last year, they launched Asya(@asya_invitationsandgifts), a store that specialised in packing gifts in an eco-friendly and reuseable manner.

Their offerings include chocolate boxes made of cardboard and paper, leatherette boxes and metal gift baskets. “The baskets, trays and boxes are made of strong materials hence they are durable and can be used as décor item or to store things,” explains Nanditha.

Shaheda and Nanditha are busy now for the upcoming wedding season. “Trousseau and return gifts are a major part of weddings. Hence a lot of people come in looking for trays and boxes to pack them in a fashionable way. While we have several colours available, pastels are in this season. From wedding cards to gift boxes everyone is picking up the pastel hues,” says Shaheda.

There is a growing trend amongst the city’s people to consciously look for re-useable and eco-friendly gifts and packages. Talking about the city’s gifting culture, Shaheda says when it comes to gifts the “the sky is the limit”. However, most of the people emphasise that the gift boxes too should be reusable and eco-friendly. “Even the flowers and other accessories used to decorate these boxes and baskets are either made of cloth or paper. We ensure no plastic is used for any of these,” says Nandita.

Apart from weddings, the store, Located in Kirlampudi Layout, also provides customised gifts for occasions like Diwali, Valentine’s Day, Christmas and Holi.

“Currently, we are working on a hamper for Holi which will be provided in a basket made from pine wood. It will have colours, balloons and a jute bag filled with dry fruits or chocolates,” says Shaheda.

450,2020/02/14,Slokasangham promotes Aksharaslokam through WhatsApp,"The group has members from across the State and outside who are from different walks of life

It’s 5.40 am. K Velappan Pillai from the city posts a Malayalam quatrain as a voice note on WhatsApp. Within eight minutes, VKV Menon from Palakkad posts another four lines as an audio clip, taking the first word from the third line of the previous verse. Next online is VK Sasidharan from Thrissur. This continues throughout the day till 10 pm, taking the total count to 119 slokas (verses). This is a typical day for members of Slokasangham, a WhatsApp group for Aksharaslokam.

For those in love with the rhyme, rhythm and metre of verses in the language, this is the equivalent of reading or hearing their favourite verses or learning some new ones every day. As the group, formed in 2014, holds its first offline session this Saturday in the city, MetroPlus catches up with a few of its members. “There are 105 members in Slokasangham and it is the passion for the art form that keeps it going. It’s all about adapting a traditional art form to suit modern times,” says AU Sudheer Kumar from Kanjiramattom in Kottayam district, chief coordinator of the group.

Velappan Pillai, the group admin, adds: “We have doctors, engineers, scientists, former employees, poets and students who recite the verses almost daily. There are members from across Kerala and from places such as Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai, in addition to those from West Asia.”

Sudheer says the concept was launched by poet Ariyannur Unnikrishnan five years ago. “There were 40 of us in that group then. When there was discontinuity in keeping it active, we formed another group, which later evolved as Slokasangham. Now, there are a few WhatsApp groups dedicated to Aksharaslokam. However, what makes us stand out is that we haven’t had a break since it was formed, except for those days when we took a break as a mark of respect when some of our members passed away,” explains Sudheer, who takes Aksharaslokam classes via WhatsApp. “It is open to all those who are interested in learning this celebration of Malayalam verses,” he says.

While Aiswarya VM, a class nine student from North Paravur in Ernakulam is among the youngest in the group, the oldest member is 83-year-old VKV Menon. “I have been into Aksharaslokam since I retired from service 25 years ago. I learnt how to use WhatsApp to be part of the group, especially after I felt lonely when my wife passed away. This is an exercise that keeps me happy and mentally active as I keep on learning verses. Now, I write my own poems as well,” says Menon, who posts as many as 20 slokams a day sometimes. Aiswarya has been taking lessons in Aksharaslokam since she was in class two. Her elder sister, Sreelakshmi VM, is also part of Slokasangham along with 25 others from her Aksharaslokam class back home.

Most of the members have been actively into Aksharaslokam since their childhood. Dr Easwaran Nampoothiri K was the first winner of the Aksharaslokam competition when it was introduced in the State school youth festival in 1975-76. “This new concept on WhatsApp has its advantages. I can post as many slokas as possible whenever I can. I also learn new verses from other members,” says 57-year-old Dr Easwaran.

Hyderabad-settled, sixty-year-old Devi Prakash says being part of the group has been a dream come true for her. “Isn’t it better late than never? I haven’t got the opportunity to be part of any Aksharaslokam session on stage when I was young and so I didn’t have to think twice to be part of the WhatsApp group,” says Devi. Radha Devi, a scientist with ISRO, is another active member of Slokasangham from Hyderabad.

Each member can post any number of voice clips, but he or she has to wait for three members to post theirs or can recite the sloka after half-an-hour provided at least one member recites the verse.

To bring in some changes, they also recite slokas starting with a particular letter for a specific number of days. “One day, 201 slokas were recited in total when the rule was to recite verses with the word ‘slokam’ in it. At the session today, there will be a round in which we will recite quatrains that start with the words ‘51 aksharam’,” Velappan Pillai adds. There have also been sessions on Malayalam triumvirate poets, ancient and modern poets.

The event is at Vyloppilly Samskrithi Bhavan on February 15 from 3 pm to 4.30 pm.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/e6gemc/article30820689.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvmaksharam,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/slokasangham-promotes-aksharaslokam-through-whatsapp/article30820690.ece
451,2020/02/14,Divej Mehta’s footwear label collaborates with Central Jail prisoners,"Shoes with a soul: Divej Mehta’s footwear label, Inmate, collaborates with prisoners at Yerwada and Puzhal Central Jails

These stylish, leather Kolhapuris have modern edge. Nothing about them suggests that these were crafted in prison.

The man behind this unusual label, Inmate, is 28-year-old businessman Divej Mehta. And his designers and craftspeople are prisoners from Yerwada and Puzhal Central Jails in Pune and Chennai.

Divej’s idea stems from a group project he did while pursuing a Masters in Business Administration in Singapore, based on the concept of private companies collaborating with the prison workforce. In 2013 Divej submitted a proposal to the Maharashtra State Prison authorities — to set up a footwear-making unit at Pune’s Yerwada Central Jail. The project meant that he would have access to a workforce, and for the prisoners, this work experience would make rehabilitation easier.

Once the project got the go ahead, Mumbai-based Divej spent around ₹ 2.5 crore on setting up the infrastructure — machinery and equipment — in the prison, “all of which I saved. I did not take any money from anybody!” As his family has been in the leather industry, exporting it, for close to 45 years; the raw material comes from here. Tergus Works Private Limited is the holding company of the brand; professionals from Tergus helped train the prisoners, fine tuning their skills.

He started production in Yerwada by January 2018, after almost a year’s training — how to make the footwear, the finishing to meet export quality standards.

Today Inmate crafts an average of 5,000 pairs of footwear every month, and retails out of about 70 stores across the country, in addition to having an online store.

Last year, in November 2019, he started working with prisoners at Puzhal Central Prison in Chennai, and aims to increase production to 20,000 pairs a month.

Not all prisoners are part of footwear unit: he works with around 200 prisoners. Prisoners selected to participate in this project are those who have at least four-five years of their prison sentence left, so they can acquire a degree of proficiency.

“The training itself takes around six to eight months. The work has to be export quality, I see this as creating a workforce that can do the work even when they get out,” says Divej.

Wages are fixed by the Government. In Maharashtra it is ₹ 61 per day. The money goes into prisoners accounts, which they can access when they leave. Work hours are also fixed: at Yerwada the prisoners work from 8 am to 4 pm and at Puzhal from, 7.30 am to 4.30 pm. Divej, however pays ₹ 200 from which ₹ 61 goes to the prisoner and the rest to a welfare fund for the prisoners.

“I cannot pay more than what the government has prescribed. The naysayers would say that I am getting labour cheap. May be I am, but there is another way of looking at it — rehabilitation and increased productivity of the prisoners,” says Divej.

Three former inmates of Yerwada, from Uttar Pradesh, have found employment at factories close to home.

Initially Divej worked with the team at Yerwada every day, when he was setting up the brand. His visits are now limited to a couple of days a week. The brand’s designers are also inmates — “We promote a few who have knack for design, and work with them for product development,” he says.

Working with prisoners or in a prison is not as intimidating as some might think, he says. “We have had to build trust and gain confidence. They have a past, one has to understand that and go about working with them. Once they understand that they stand to benefit they trust you.”

He adds, “I am just doing what is right, doing things my way and so far so good.”

453,2020/02/14,The second innings; On dealing with Retirement Syndrome,"Want to know more about the Retirement Syndrome? Read on...

After a career spanning many continents, many years and thousands of clients, retirement should have been a well deserved break for R Kumar. He had made the right investments, had saved enough and was financially more than comfortable, and he could look forward to a stress-free life doing things that he had no time for while he worked. But things did not quite go that way and Kumar found himself unsettled and far from contented. He had trouble making new friends, began to shun company and his family found him irritable, indifferent and often forgetful.

What Kumar did not know was that he was showing typical symptoms of Retirement Syndrome — the psychological inability to let go the position of authority and having problems adjusting to the new role. A workaholic and one who enjoyed considerable clout at work, Kumar found himself no longer in control of things as he had once been.

People who have enjoyed positions of rank and privilege and who have to give them up (CEOs, senior armed forces personnel, politicians) when they hang up their boots are likely to be maladjusted to their slower paced post-retirement lives. This type of adjustment disorder is now seen in an epidemic proportion, more so since family support and social dynamics are not geared up to help the individual any more. While certain types of personalities are more prone to this adjustment disorder, men are more vulnerable to it.

Why does this happen?

This happens usually because they are only geared up to deal with work stress. They have stayed away for too long from family and domestic matters and are unable to make any sense of it or make changes and compromises. Their social circle was limited to the workplace but post retirement they have to interact with a variety of people. They are unable to forge new friendships/relationships with people who have ‘nothing in common’ with them.

They are no longer the decision maker or the person in control. They are newcomers to an environment that runs efficiently without their inputs. Suddenly, they find they have too much time and very little to do. They find reading, gardening, walking or developing another hobby ‘unproductive’.

Unlike at work, they do not know what their role is in the family. They find themselves a part of a unit that is functioning efficiently without any inputs from them.

If they move to another city post retirement, that is an added challenge to someone who already has an adjustment disorder.

What to do?

Severe cases of retirement syndrome can lead to depression and often suicidal thoughts. Therefore, counselling helps them re-orient their identity and responsibilities to accommodate the changing roles. An understanding family and support from old and new friends greatly facilitates this transition.

Wives are not exempt. Retired Husband Syndrome (RHS) is a psychosomatic stress-related illness often seen in women whose husbands have just retired. Their interferences and attempts to dominate domestic affairs can be a cause of stress to the women.

454,2020/02/14,WHO to not call novel coronavirus by official name,"Organisation is unhappy as ‘SARS’ is mentioned in it and can create ‘unnecessary fear’

Three days after the novel coronavirus got an official name, the World Health Organization has clearly indicated that it will not use the official name in all its public communication while referring to the virus.

On February 11, the WHO announced COVID-19 as the name for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The “CO” in COVID stands corona, while “VI” is for virus and “D” for disease. The number 19 stands for the year 2019 when the outbreak was first identified.

The same day, in a preprint posted in the bioRxiv repository, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced the official name for the virus — “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” or “SARS-CoV-2”.

The Study Group had assessed the novelty of the virus to arrive at the name. The Coronavirus Study Group is responsible for developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming of the Coronaviridae family to which the novel coronavirus belongs.

A news item published on February 12 in the journal Science, which was updated on February 13, now mentions that the WHO is “not happy” with the name given to the virus and hence is not planning to adopt it. It will instead call the pathogen “virus responsible for COVID-19” or the “COVID-19 virus”, a WHO spokesperson told Science via an email.

The WHO has clarified that neither of the two names that it plans to use to refer to the novel coronavirus is “intended as replacements for the official name of the virus” that the Study Group has chosen.

The reason why the WHO is not happy with the name and its refusal to use it while referring to the virus stems from the fact that the official name given to the virus has SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) mentioned in it. The SARS coronavirus, which was identified in 2003, first infected humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002. The SARS epidemic spread to 29 countries and resulted in 8,096 laboratory confirmed cases and 774 deaths before it was contained in July 2003.

So, from a “risk communications perspective, using the name SARS can have unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some populations, especially in Asia, which was worst affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003”, the spokesperson told Science.

Different criteria

The WHO and the Study Group use two very different criteria and approaches while deciding the names. The WHO arrives at the name of a new disease by following the May 2015 guidelines. According to the guidelines, the disease name should not include geographic locations and people’s names as this can be stigmatising. Also, names of animals such as swine flu should be avoided as this leads to confusion. The guidelines also say that it should avoid “terms that incite undue fear” while choosing a name.

The Study Group adopts a “scientific approach” while naming a new coronavirus. Based on whole genome sequence shared by China and other countries, scientists have confirmed that the novel virus belongs to the same species as the one that caused the SARS epidemic, which is called SARS-related coronavirus.

“The virus may be novel to the rest of the world, but it isn’t really to taxonomists. So it’s not getting its own name. Instead, the committee appended a ‘2’ for viruses isolated from patients in Wuhan and elsewhere,” the chair of the Study Group John Ziebuhr of Justus Liebig University Giessen told Science.

According to Science, the paper was sent to bioRxiv repository on February 7, four days before it was posted on the repository. The authors had also sent the paper to a scientific journal for publication. After the outbreak, the WHO had requested all scientific journals to first share with it any paper that they receive before publishing. “Research findings relevant to the outbreak are shared immediately with the World Health Organization (WHO) upon journal submission, by the journal and with author knowledge,” notes a February 4 editorial in Nature.

So, the WHO was aware of the official name given by the Study Group to the novel coronavirus well before it announced the name of the disease. “The timing of WHO’s announcement was not influenced by the arrival of the manuscript,” the WHO spokesperson told Science.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/l21lyb/article30799115.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RUSSIACHINAOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/who-to-not-call-novel-coronavirus-by-official-name/article30819441.ece
